["Q: Can I use Apple's Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter for Target Display Mode on an iMac? Apple's support page for the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter lists support for Thunderbolt Displays and no support for Apple DisplayPort displays. However it doesn't say anything about iMacs with Thunderbolt in Target Mode mode. Does Apple's Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter support Target Display Mode on an iMac?\nMy guess is that it does since Apple's support page for Target Display Mode says that you have to use a Thunderbolt source for an iMac with Thunderbolt in order to use Target Display Mode.\n\nA: Yes, I'm successfully running a setup with a 2017 13\" MacBook Pro and a 2011 iMac. The original Apple USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter works fine for Target Display Mode.\n\nA: Unfortunately no.\nI am running a setup with a 2016 MacBook Pro, the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter and a 2013 iMac 27\".\nEdit: I was wrong. It is possible. You will have to press Cmd+F2 to active TDM with this configuration. My old iMac switches to TDM automatically. That's why I was confused, sorry!\n\nA: Yes, in some circumstances. This Apple support page lists the supported hardware combinations and required cable(s).\n", "Q: After installing Windows 7, my MacMini won't boot Lion anymore I installed Windows 7 Ultimate 32bits in a MacMini 2,1 using bootcamp. I used a DVD media with multiply choices trough an external sata superdrive with usb adaptor. Windows seams ok, with the exception that I can't eject the disk from that superdrive... things to solve later.\nProblem is now it will only boot Windows. I tried to boot with Alt pressed and nothing. So I edited the BCD file with easyBCD 2.3, add the Lion in the list and check it as default. Now the boot stops in a text screen of Windows Boot Manager, both systems are listed in the middle. If I chose \"NST Mac OS X\", will appear a screen with a strange green animal at the top, the windows logo and a countdown below. I can press F8 to escape to a list os OS. This new screen got \"Darwin/x86 Boot v5.0.132\" description and three logos: OS X, Windows NTFS, Windows (the second HDD though)... and the strange animal above. If I chose the Apple logo, it will returns to first text screen.\nHow can I make it boot Mac OS X Lion again?\nEDIT. Photos of the screens:\n\n\n\n\nA: So a guy in MacRumors ask me why I didn't install the Boot Camp drivers in Windows yet - I don't know, nobody mention this before (or I really miss this part). The package is more than just drivers, will install a control panel similar to OS X and will change the boot either - just what I was looking for. After install it, I could finally boot from Lion just by selecting in the list of the control panel.\nUnfortunately, I cannot copy-paste the link for the Apple page about those drivers because the site will auto switch to pt-br... I think you will find it easily by searching support.apple.com with google. You got to look for instructions about installing old versions of Windows in old Macs, there is an article about this. Just a warning: each system/Windows require a specific package and version (4 ou 5). Pick the right one and you will be happy.\nIf you got the link in english, please share with us.\n", "Q: Services menu on right click in Apple Mail missing? In macOS Sierra, Mail app, I select a message and right click. The \"Services\" selection is missing.\nI can select text within a message and right click, seeing the services menu, but I swear this worked before just fine and I've used it a ridiculous amount of times with specific apps. \nThis: Services submenu disappeared from contextual menu of right click did not help.\n\nA: Might need to update your plugins for Sierra (if you use that Mac OS). I had the same issue with Omnifocus clip o iron and had to update it here: https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/clip-o-tron-in-sierra/26977\n", "Q: Unable to get Intel HD 4000 graphics and audio working on EFI install of Windows 10 Bootcamp on Macbook Pro mid 2012 I have installed Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro mid-2012 (MacBookPro9,1) using the EFI method. Note: I am intentionally wanting to use Windows 10 in EFI mode instead of the legacy MBR/BIOS method. \nBelow are the basic specs of my MacbookPro9,1 model:\n\n\n*\n\n*15inch display with NO Retina \n\n*i7-3720QM 2.6GHz with Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics\n\n*Nvidia GeForce GT 650M dedicated graphics\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n*EFI and SMC firmware are updated to latest by installing macOS Sierra \n\n\nI used this guide to install Windows 10 using EFI method: https://fgimian.github.io/blog/2016/03/12/installing-windows-10-on-a-mac-without-bootcamp/ \nI was able to successfully install Windows 10 using EFI method. After installing Windows 10, I installed the latest v6 of Bootcamp drivers and support software. Everything works except for the below listed below. \nProblem\nI am unable to get audio to work. There is no sound from the speakers or headphones. Device manager shows \"This device cannot start. (Code 10)\" for High Definition Audio Controller. After reading around in other forums, the audio issue could be related to Intel graphics drivers. I am unable properly install the integrated Intel HD 4000 graphics drivers also. \nAs shown in the attached image, the Device Manager shows a yellow exclamation mark on \"Microsoft Basic Display Adapter\" and \"High Definition Audio Controller\". The attached image shows the device error for each of these. \nTo get the audio/sound working, I tried running the following two files. However, this still didn't fix the issue: \n\n\n*\n\n*BootCamp\\Drivers\\Cirrus\\CirrusAudioCS4206x64.exe \n\n*BootCamp\\Drivers\\Cirrus\\CirrusAudioCS4208x64.exe \n\n\nI tried updating the drivers for the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter to Intel HD 4000 drivers using multiple methods (listed below). In all cases, the drivers are detected but while the drivers are being installed, Windows crashes and automatically reboots. \n\n\n*\n\n*Letting Windows search automatically for updated driver software \n\n*Bootcamp drivers located in BootCamp\\Drivers\\Intel\\IntelIvb_Win10\\Graphics\n\n*Intel HD 4000 graphics drivers on Intel's Download center website \n\n\nIf I am connected to the internet, Windows 10 by default automatically tries to install the latest display drivers in the background. This leads the computer crashing and rebooting. I have to manually prevent Windows 10 from automatically updating the drivers to stop the crashing from occurring. \nIs there way to at-least get the audio to work?  Is there anyway I can properly get the Intel HD 4000 drivers to install in the EFI install of Windows 10 on Macbook Pro mid 2012? \n\nSee image below also. \n\n\nA: I realize this is an old thread, but I had this same issue and I was finally able to get the on board audio working by following this:\nhttps://egpu.io/forums/pc-setup/fix-dsdt-override-to-correct-error-12/\nI think they attempted this in order to install an eGPU but it serves the purpose of allowing the on-board audio to work. The only thing that isn't working on my 2012 non-retina MBP is the on board graphics driver (Intel Graphics HD 4000) which is fine because the NVIDIA drivers work fine (only with the most recent driver patch from December 28, 2018, the \"current\" drivers from December 12 crash the computer) and allow proper \"sleep\" which wasn't possible previously. \nOnly feature that doesn't work is the ability to adjust the brightness. Staring at this very bright screen will drive me crazy, but in trying to fix this one last problem, I have had to re-install Windows twice, so I am about ready to give up. Any ideas?\n\nA: So far, I have been unable to get the headphones or the internal speakers working via EFI boot. I haven't tried a default Boot Camp install since I want to run off an external, but it sounds like it works just fine if you're willing to go that route.\nThe good news is if you can get the Boot Camp 6.0 support drivers, it installs an NVIDIA driver compatible with our machine, and (just like the Intel driver) it ALSO handles the audio. It won't get your headphones or speakers working, but it DOES see them and it DOES transmit audio over the display port to HDMI.\nOne more trick I haven't tried -- burning the ISO to DVD and installing from that. Supposedly that forces the installation into Legacy mode, in which case the Intel/audio drivers install correctly.\n", "Q: I received a call about my iCloud account and I need to know if it is a scam I just received a call stating my iCloud account has been compromised.  They want me to go on my computer with them.  Is this a scam? \n\nA: Yes, you will never receive an unexpected call regarding your iCloud account, so it is a scam.\n\nA: Apple will never call you and ask you to \"go on [your] computer with them\" to recover a compromised iCloud account (which they would refer to as an Apple ID, not iCloud account).\nIf you called them about a compromised Apple ID, they use the information you provided at registration and possibly information you email or fax to them (such as driver's license) to verify your identity and reset your account.\n", "Q: Connecting Macbook to WiFi network breaks internet for everyone I have a 2015 Macbook pro, which I bought about 3 months ago.\nSome days ago, when I was using it, and connected it to my house's wifi network, everyone's internet connection suddenly dropped (as in they couldn't load anything, but wifi was intact). It didn't just happen in my house, so it makes me think something is wrong with my Mac.\nIf it helps, it's running Sierra.\nI found out that this has happened to other people: http://www.mac-forums.com/internet-networking-and-wireless/183185-macbook-airport-breaks-internet-connection-entire-network.html\nBut nothing there was helpful.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\nIMPORTANT EDIT: I believe I've found the cause of the problem: I'm using the program Parallels to run ubuntu, ** and if the program is not on, I can't lose all my internet connection.**\nI've uninstalled the program and now I'm on a bigger problem now: I still can't connect to internet and I can't reinstall the program... help pleas\n\nA: If I were you, I would backup all your important files, reformat the disk and reinstall the macOS unless you would have a better clue of what the problem is. It might be something as simple as a corrupted preferences file or as difficult as a faulty hardware component. If you try this approach and you find out that everything is working as it should then at least you can exclude any hardware problem.\n", "Q: The Mac won't let me import photos from my iphone I am trying to import my photos from my iphone to my mac and even though i already put trust this computer, the mac insists that i haven't done it yet. i have done it many times and its still not working. Any idea of how to solve this?\n\nA: On your iphone, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy.\nPlug in your iPhone via the USB to your mac.\nOn your iPhone when prompted press \"Trust\".\nYou should now be able to import.\n\nA: Since you haven't specified the version of macOS you're running, this advice will be somewhat general in nature.\nOn the Mac there are a number of ways to import photos. You don't explain how you've tried to import them, but have you tried using the Image Capture app or either the iPhoto and/or Photos apps (depending on what OS you have installed) instead of what you normally try? \n[EDIT - Sometimes trying a different approach will trigger the Trust computer prompt and this will be accepted/remembered for next time]\nThese apps can be found within your Applications folder. The one you use will depend on how you want to manage your photos:\n\n\n*\n\n*Image Capture provides a way for you to just import your photos to your Mac's hard drive to access and use as you wish. By default they will import to your Pictures folder, but you can select other locations as well as create subfolders.\n\n*iPhoto and/or Photos are apps that not only import your photos, but allow you to manage and organise them into albums, produce books, etc.\n\n\nRegardless of the option you choose, all these apps will recognise your iPhone when it is connected via USB to your Mac. You need to just select the device from the app and import the photos. \nThese options are separate to iTunes and, in effect, just treat your iPhone as a camera.\nEDIT\n[This edit adds info about dealing with the 'trust computer' issue]\nIf trying one of the 'other' methods listed above still doesn't work for you, then the trick may be to get the prompt for the iPhone to trust the computer to pop up instead. You can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your iPhone\n\n*Connect the iPhone to your Mac via USB\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Switch on your iPhone\n\n*iTunes should then prompt you about the iPhone trusting the computer (instead of the iPhone prompting you)\n\n*Confirm that you want to trust the computer\n\n*On the iPhone prompt that follows, also trust the computer\n\n\nHopefully the next time you attempt to use image capture/iPhoto/Photos to import photos you won't have a problem.\nHowever, if you do still have a problem, you can also try resetting your iPhone's Network settings. You do this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to Settings\n\n*Tap on General\n\n*Swipe up and tap on Reset at the bottom of the screen\n\n*Tap on Reset network settings\n\n\nKeep in mind once you've reset your Network settings you will need to reenter any WiFi passwords again you normally connect to.\n", "Q: Imac turn off the screen: where is the eject button to use in the shortcut? I have a small wireless keyboard. Where can I find the eject button to turn screen off??\n\nA: At the back of the screen. It's the same as the power button. There may be a setting to make this work.\n", "Q: MacBook Air (Early 2015) Network Driver for Linux I got an unexpected question when installing a Debian Based Linux on my Late 2015 MacBook Air:\nDetect network hardware\n\nNo Ethernet card was detected. If you know the name of the driver\nneeded by your Ethernet cars, you can select it from the list.\n\nThe list is huge.\n\nSome of the notable names are:\n\n\n*\n\n*rtl8723ae: Realtek 8723e 802.11ax PCI wireless\n\n*b43legacy: Broadcom 4400 10/100 PCI Ethernet \n\n*adm8211: Driver for IEEE 802.11b wireless cards based on ADMtek ADM8211\n\n\nI would restart and try to find information in it, but the installation was failing before ( tried more than 10 times), and it is working now. I don't wanna take any chances.\nThis is the only information I found in Apple's website :\n\nWireless: 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n\n  compatible\n\nWhat is the right driver? Thanks!\n\nA: There is no such thing as a late 2015 MacBook Air model. I'm assuming you have the early 2015 model.\nIn that case your computer has a Broadcom BCM4360 chipset for WiFi.\nThe driver you would need in debian is the \"wl\" driver. You will probably need to install the broadcom-sta-dkms package manually and then load the wl driver.\nThe driver is non-free/binary-only so probably not listed during installation.\n", "Q: How can I run a current browser on older MacBook? I have an older macbook that tops out at Snow Leopard. That is, this is the limit of OS X that it will run.\nCurrent versions of Chrome and Firefox are not supported for Snow Leopard (10.6) Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8)\nThis machine is mostly used for surfing the web while semi-watching TV.\nI am concerned about maintaining reasonable security while surfing.\nOptions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Run another OS: FreeBSD 8 is supposed to run on MacBook Pro, but that puts me 3 major releases behind current.  Mint Linux is another fairly lightweight version.  I'm quite content to run a simple window manager (In my Linux days, I used fvwm by preference)\n\n*Strip Snow Leopard down as much as possible, run VirtualBox in it, and run an OS in that. Set up the mac OS to be in bridge mode, and be unaware of the internet.\n\n*Set up MacBook Pro as a VNC/Teamviewer and use one of my screens from my Mac Pro upstairs.\n\n\nOption 1 is apparently difficult to get a usable workstation on it.\nOption 2 is not clear what can be stripped, shut off, etc.\nOption 3 needs directions on how to safeguard the MacBook Pro to allow only local networking, with no or very limited access to the world.  It has the advantage that I am still working in a Mac user space.\nIt's not clear to me what the relative merits of each of these approaches is.\nWhat are the tradeoffs of these approaches.\nIs there a 4th approach I'm missing?\n\nI have multiple computers and the original machine I was asking about indeed will run a newer version of the OS.  Curiously, if you click 'software update' it does not report this as a potential update. It's installing as I write.\nI have accordingly rephrased the question in light of the next older laptop, as the repurposing of older macbooks is a field of significant interest to many long time mac users.  At this point I'm leaning toward the TeamViewer approach.\n\nA: All MacBook Pros produced mid/late 2007 and later (MacBookPro3,1...) can be upgraded to at least OS X 10.11. \nSo install OS X 10.9 or later on your (mid/late 2007-...) MacBook Pro (3,1-...) and enjoy the latest Google Chrome and/or Firefox browser.\nThe system requirements for Firefox 49 are 10.9-10.11 and for Google Chrome 54 10.9 and later\n", "Q: Apple Configurator 2 - How to edit an installed Configuration Profile? I wish to modify an existing Configuration Profile installed on an iPhone, but I do not have a disk copy of it, nor can I download it again from the source (no longer available).  Using Apple Configurator 2 there appears to be no way to export to disk, or modify, the full contents of an already existing and installed Configuration Profile.  Nor indeed to inspect its contents (which would provide a tedious but manual way to re-create a new profile by inspecting the contents of an existing one)\nIs there a way of extracting an installed Configuration Profile from an iDevice to disk so that I can then open it and modify it using Configurator?  Thanks.\n\nA: There isn't a way to do this.

Am I not able to use this second monitor?\n\nA: Your iMac can support up to two displays at 4096 by 2160 pixels, or one display at 5120 by 2880 pixels.\nIn other words, to use the second display in addition to the built in display they both need to run at 4K.

As a person with a rather bad MacBook Pro speed (only have 4GB, and it is currently using 3.5GB with about 1.5GB being compressed memory) at the moment, I'm wondering if it is possible to connect another MacBook pro, MacBook or any other computer and use their RAM/Memory alongside the memory I already have on this computer.\nIs this possible? If it is, how would I go about doing this?\nThanks.\n\nA: Unfortunately this is not possible, because the overhead of keeping the two sets of hardware in sync would far outweigh the benefits provided therein. \nHow old is your MacBook? If it is old enough the RAM may be removable / upgradable. \n\nA: Put simply, no. Computer hardware doesn't work like that; you have to either install some more memory (iFixIt's guides are quite useful, for instance) or switch computers.\nOf course, if you have some scientific/heavy simulation workload you can always setup a computing cluster, but I'm assuming this is not the kind of work you have in mind for your MacBook.\n", "Q: HDD on the verge of dying? So, I've found myself in a quite tight spot regarding my internal HDD.\nI've got a 13\" Late 2011 MBP, running macOS 10.12.1, which is behaving very strangely lately: Mail will refuse to open, with an error message complaining about network and home folder problems; Finder won't let me create new directories (they appear and then instantly vanish - they weren't created at all, according to my Dropbox log); and Disk Utility gives inconsistent results: sometimes it will say everything's fine, while other times it indicates disk corruption. \nStranger still, is that no external storage appears on my Desktop. They do show in System Information under the respective USB controller, but no signs of life either from Finder or Disk Utility.\nI've tried rebooting the system to see if things would come back to normal; instead, I was greeted to a Kernel Panic at startup, complete with white text under a black background. After trying to use the recovery partition to run Disk Utility again, a second attempt would result in a \"block sign\" being displayed if I tried accessing said partition, and Internet Recovery's Disk Utility just hang up after an hour checking the Catalog File.\nI was only able to boot back into macOS by trying to boot into verbose mode (Cmd+Shift+V), and for some reason the system came back to life. It still has the exact same problems as before, with the addition that, after choosing to send Apple a Crash Report, the \"ReportCrash\" process is now taking an entire processing core for about an hour, with no signs of high disk activity.\nThis is quite frustrating, given that it's been about 6 months I've replaced its original 750GB HDD for a 1TB Toshiba hybrid drive (1TB disk; 8GB flash), and things were working very smoothly until then.\nBefore I reboot my Mac again, I'd like to know if anyone has ever encountered a similar isse, and what can be done to minimize the damage. I have a 30-day-old Time Machine backup, and can read the drive using a secondary Linux machine in order to not lose more data, but as-is, what is the best course of action?\nEDIT: After following @Allan's suggestion and running the Apple Hardware Test (online version) on extended mode, the HDD is indeed reported. The output is as follows:\nTest Results\n________________________________________\n\nAlert! Apple Hardware Test has detected an error.\n\n4HDD/11/40000004: SATA(0,0)\n\n\nPass Number: 1,\nTotal Time Testing: 44 mins 53 secs\n\nGuess I'll try to image the HDD this night under Linux, using ddrescue, and restore to the older 750GB HDD; I'll follow up with more progress later. Thanks to @jksoegaard and @Allan for the moment!\nEDIT 2: On trying ddrescue the drive oddly reported no read errors, even though almost every time I run it through fsck.hfsplus the reported results are different. I've also decided to check its S.M.A.R.T. data; to my surprise, it reports no reallocated sectors, but an alarmingly high rate of UDMA CRC Errors (11752, out of a 253 worst-recommended value).\nI've decided to try to save as most as I could from my home directory using the Linux machine (fortunately only a couple uninportant files seemed corrupt, even though macOS refused to read the disk through an external SATA<->USB converter), and put back the original 750GB HDD on the MacBook, which is being currently restored from the aforementioned Time Machine Backup.\nNext step is to return the HDD under warranty and try to claim a new one, I suppose. Thanks so much to everybody for the help!\n\nA: The best course of action is to use the secondary Linux machine to read the drive and make a bit-for-bit copy as soon as possible. Use a program such as ddrescue to ensure you get as possible out.\nAfter you've made the copy, do any recovery attempts of file contents on the image you've created with ddrescue.\nYour hybrid drive is most probably failing and failing fast. Hybrid drives have a lot more failure modes than a regular hard drive or SSD drive, so that's why you can experience very odd things happening - without for example it being the same sectors that are \"bad\" all the time.\nYou'll need to replace the drive. As it is only 6 months, perhaps you can get it replaced under warranty from the drive manufacturer or seller.\n\nA: Firstly, back up your data.\nOnce you have done that, there are some steps you could try to check the health of your drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check SMART status\nThis will give you several indications of the health status of your drive. Note that it has been shown that SMART numbers don't always predict drive failure.\nYou used to be able to do this in Disk Utility by Apple has dumbed down that piece of software to the point of uselessness. You can do this however, with a 3rd party app such as the free trial of DriveDx, available on the App Store. I have used this several times to check the health of a drive, just be sure to delete it when you're done so it doesn't keep nagging you.  \nIf when you run the test you have several warnings or pre-failure warnings, it is good bet that your drive is on the way out. Note that not all drives support this.\n\n*Disk first aid in Disk Utility \nThe Disk Dtility app can attempt to find and fix errors automatically. Open the Disk Utility app, click on the offending physical drive and click \"first aid\". It will freeze up your system for a few minutes while it works. Repeat this process on all partitions you have on the drive too. It will warn you if it found issues and what it was able to do about them \n\n*Repair Permissions. \nI have found this to fix a multitude of issues for me. \nFirst, open up terminal by pressing CMD+SPACE and enter TERMINAL.  Press ENTER.\nThen, to see if this might be an issue for you run:\nsudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --verify --standard-pkgs /\n\nAnd see if there are any files with damaged permissions. You may see something like below. If you have 100s of faulty permissions, it could be another sign of an early disk failure. As always, keep backups.\nPermissions differ on \"Library/Java\", should be drwxr-xr-x , they are drwxrwxr-x .\nUser differs on \"private/var/db/displaypolicyd\", should be 0, user is 244.\nGroup differs on \"private/var/db/displaypolicyd\", should be 0, group is 244.\n\nSo in this example it is a good chance Java permissions are the culprit.

So it will run all background update and maintenance processes via that WLAN connection. As my WLAN is in fact a small box with LTE access (payed by volume) I would like to configure the connection as if it were a tethered mobile connection, which it really is.\nThe answers to the similiar question Managing Metered Connections on OSX all recommend some third party tools, how can I solve it solely with built-in functionality and tools (macOS Sierra, if it helps)?\n\nA: It appears that you cannot without a third party extension.\nIn this question: How does iOS and OS X detect when a Wi-Fi network is a personal hotspot?\nThere is an answer that describes how OS X detects whether the connection is a personal hotspot and it seems that there is some meta data that's embedded within the signal that identifies it as a hotspot or not.  (There's even some code that checks for if it's a carplay device, too)\n\nApple controls the Hardware, the Drivers and the Operating System, I\n  guess they can easily add extra metadata when broadcasting the WiFi\n  signal so your Mac knows to whether adding the chain icon or not.\n\n", "Q: Mac Pro early2008 El Cap. LOGIC BOARD compatibility w/ later models I just found this site today and it looks sweet! I believe I need to replace the logic board in my unit. Would a board from a 2009 or newer work on my 2008 Mac pro currently with 2x Intel quad 2.8ghz (part 661-4449)? I would like to know in order to expand on the availability of used parts out there and possibly score a faster processor.\n\nA: No. The machines are totally different as soon as you take the side off, visually & electronically.\nThe top ⅓ is visually similar, though the 08 uses PATA connections in the optical bay, the 09 has SATAII.\nAs for the rest, these are just the visible highlights...\nThe 08 mounts the CPUs directly to the motherboard, 'sideways' like a standard PC, with separate removable RAM daughterboards onto which individual sticks are installed.\nAt the front is a large dual fan assembly.\n  \n08 pics EveryMac & OWC\nThe 2009 has an entirely different structure - both the CPUs & RAM are on a removable daughterboard, the huge front fan assembly has been replaced by a single fan & a nice PCI card release, far improved over the 08's 'fiddle around underneath like a PC' structure.\n\n09 pic OWC\nOWC's picture also hints at (well, advertises;-) one more thing about the 09.\nIt can reasonably simply be upgraded to 2012 5,1 firmware & will take dual 6-core Westmere's rather than the original Nehalems.\nIt can also be updated to Sierra 10.12 once the firmware has been upgraded.\nI forgot to mention that the memory isn't compatible either.\nThe 08 takes DDR2 [expensive these days]\nThe 08 takes DDR3 [much cheaper]\nAlso, & you really can't tell without sitting two side by side, the drive sleds are different sizes. To move a drive from an 08 to an 09 you must use the correct sled or the pins don't match up to the motherboard when you slide them in.\nThe 08's still a good machine for its age, but the 09 upgraded to [actually higher than originally purchasable] 2012 spec is still quite the beast.\nI have one of each, 08 & upgraded 09. Both going strong.\nPurely my own opinion, but I'd be tempted to trade up the 08 to an 09 - you can get them very easily on eBay etc, fully upgraded & ready to go. [Mine is a dual 6-core 3.46GHz, 64GB RAM, cost £1600, UKP. I added a decent graphics card & still had change from 2 grand.]\n", "Q: Process assistantd keep writing login keychain This is a Sierra box, the system memory was suddenly out of usage.

I used to see \"Add All\" as an option when viewining the .ics events. Now, all I see where \"Add All\" used to be is \"Done\".  If I tap any of the individual 36 events, I have an option to add to calendar as an individual event, but can no longer add numerous events from one .ics file with one click.\nNot accusing, but, this seems to be occurring since updating to iOS 10.1.1. Anyone else experience this? \n\nA: Once imported iOS seems to remember the filename and hides \"Add All\" to prevent a second import (which would duplicate the events).\nWhen you're sending yourself a new set of events, try using a different filename (add a timestamp or something similar).\n(the same thing happened to me with a web generated set of events under iOS 9)\n", "Q: iTunes says an update is available but iPhone doesn't (iOS 10.1.1) I recently updated my 6s Plus to iOS 10.1.1, and says it has the latest version. But when i connect it to iTunes both in mac & win it says an update available with the same version number.\nshould i upgrade or ignore?\n\nA: Answer from this MacRumors article: http://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/09/apple-releases-new-version-of-ios-10-1-1/\n\nApple today seeded a minor version change to iOS 10.1.1, the current\n  version of the iOS 10 operating system. The update is minor enough\n  that it did not warrant a full 10.x.x number change, but it does\n  include an updated build number. \niOS 10.1.1 being released today has a build number of 14B150, while\n  the initial iOS 10.1.1 release, which came on October 31, had a build\n  number of 14B100.\nThe new build of iOS 10.1.1 is only available as a download from\n  Apple's servers and cannot be obtained over-the-air at this time for\n  those who have already installed the first version of iOS 10.1.1. The\n  new version of iOS 10.1.1 will likely be provided to those who have\n  yet to install iOS 10.1.1, as it otherwise requires an iTunes\n  connection to obtain.\n\nIn other words, you can safely update via iTunes to benefit from this minor update.\n\nA: I suspect there was a security patch made. Last year there was an update of a zero day exploit which was installed over the wires by link found in an email, with three unknown vulnerabilities.\nYesterday one of my banking apps said that my phone had been jailbroken - which I never did so I suspect that over the last few weeks a vulnerability has been found and must be updated via itunes only\n", "Q: How to reset security questions if I forgot them I've forgotten security questions to my account and I want to reset them. I've logged into my Apple ID, went to security section, and went ahead and clicked the link which says \"Reset security questions?\" in case I've forgotten it, which is my case.\nI've entered my password, and it is asking for the answers of the  very security questions that I'm trying to reset. What is the point of asking the answers after clicking the link to reset them in the case that I've forgotten it?\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nA: If you can't remember your answers ...\nHave a look at: If you forgot the answers to your Apple ID security questions\nAt Apple ID, follow the onscreen steps to verify your identity. If you don't get any options to verify your identity, you can't reset your security questions at this time.\nChoose new security questions and answers and select Continue.\nIf you need more help, contact Apple Support\n\nA: The following is a way that - seemingly - not even Apple Support knows about, I've found it myself after I got told that my account's situation is hopeless and I cannot get it back.\nI forgot the answers to all of my security questions and did not have a rescue email. There is no way to reset the questions in that scenario, your only option is to get rid of the questions altogether - and you can do that by enabling two-factor authentication. The catch is that you must answer some security questions to enable it from Settings.\nAnd here is the interesting part: if you log in with your Apple ID on a device (I did it with an iPhone 5 running iOS 10, but any iOS 10+ device should work), log out and do that several times, you'll eventually get a popup to enable 2FA... and it will let you do that without answering a single security question! I got the popup after logging in and out just once, but your results may vary.\n\nOthers have confirmed that this method still works in March 2021:\n\nI had a very old Apple ID with remaining credit that was only used for iTunes and not yet activated for iCloud. I had already changed the password via the email address some time ago. But resetting the security questions was not possible anymore, because I could not answer enough questions for that. And after several attempts even this form was blocked for the meantime.\n\n\nOn an old iPhone 4s (iOS 9.3.6) the Apple ID was still stored under iTunes & App Store (I don't know if it is required to use a device which was already linked to this Apple ID). I also entered the same Apple ID under iCloud to activate iCloud for this Apple ID. I then entered my phone number under iCloud > Apple ID > Contact information (confirmed by code from SMS). Entering an additional email adress was at this stage not possible. Thereafter, under iCloud > Apple ID > Password & Security, the two-factor authentication could be enabled for the same phone number (eventually an unlock code has to be set prior under Settings). I had to confirm the activation via the code sent by SMS. Logging in to icloud.com was then possible again and I was able to update all account information.\n\n", "Q: I just installed Garageband on my mac but I don't know if it charged my card So, I wanted to use an app to edit some audio for a project. I have a mac but it does not have an in-built GB app, so when I looked for it online, it said that I had to pay $4.99. I did not want to buy the app for I let it be. But I was on App Store just now and it asked me to install the app (it did not say purchase), so I installed it. Now, how do I know if it was charged or did it download for free because I have a mac?\n\nA: There is an easy way to check this. Go into iTunes and click the Store tab. Once it has loaded, scroll to the very bottom of the page, and under Manage you will see a link to your Account. Click there and sign into your Apple ID if prompted, then under Purchase History click See All. This will give you a list of all the apps you have downloaded from the App Store, iTunes store, and other Apple services. Find GarageBand in the list, and if the price is labeled as $0.00, you will not be charged for the app. But if it is labeled otherwise, you will be charged for the app.\n", "Q: Rename the \"Terminal\" app in OSX Is there any way to rename the Terminal app?\nWhen I try to rename it by right-clicking it, that option is greyed out.\n\nA: Apple doesn't allow user to rename any app that comes with the O/S\n", "Q: Dual-Boot OS X Snow Leopard on MacBook Pro Is it possible to dual-boot Snow Leopard on a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro running Sierra? I have the DMG file so maybe I can make a bootable flashdrive?\n\nA: Unless I'm totally missing something from your question, no mid-2012 MacBook Pro can run a version of OS X earlier than Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4.\nMore specifically, each of the three mid-2012 MacBook Pros initially shipped with Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4 and the firmware does not support any prior version of macOS. On the positive side they do all support macOS Sierra.\nIf you have need to dual boot into an older OS, then it will have to be any version from Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4 and above.\n", "Q: Scrolling does not register each click of the wheel Whenever I scroll using my mouse, my computer does not register the small, individual clicks of the scroll wheel.

My brother and I share a computer and often use the same itunes app for all our music. Something that it does that I hate is it puts all my voice memos in, too. I would rather them not be there because I'm worried my brother will get on and listen to them one day. I try to delete them but it says if I delete them off itunes, it also deletes them off of my iphone which I don't want it to do. What should I do??\n\nA: You are correct. Basically Apple's approach is a case of Better to be safe than sorry.\nWhat I mean is that music originates from your iTunes library (or Apple Music), so you can afford to lose it if something happens to your iPhone. You still have your music on your Mac or in the cloud. Voice Memos, on the other hand, originate on your iPhone. If something happens to your iPhone, they are gone forever. So Apple has designed iTunes to treat Voice Memos differently, and automatically sync them back to iTunes for safe keeping. This is all based on the fact we're more likely to lose our iPhones (or have them stolen) than we are our Macs.\nUnfortunately, this approach has frustrated many users as there is no way to manually override this. Apple did create a Voice Memos playlist to help users better manage/navigate their memos, but there's no way to stop them syncing from your iPhone to iTunes on your computer. The only built-in option is to stop it syncing back the other way.\nGetting around your situation\nThere are really only four options to try and avoid your brother listening to your voice memos. These are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use separate User Accounts on your Mac. That is, use one for you and one for your brother. Each of you will then have your own instance of iTunes. To set up separate user accounts go to System Preferences > Users & Groups and click on the + sign at bottom left. You may need to unlock the padlock before you can make changes. Also, in your login options you may want to turn off Automatic Login. Basically, using this option means you should not share your password with your brother! :)\n\n*Manually delete your Voice Memos from your iTunes Library / Store them somewhere else. The easiest way to access voice memos is to go to the Voice Memos playlist. You can just delete them BUT before you do, you may want to make a copy of the ones you want and store them somewhere else. The easiest way to do this is to right-click on them and select Copy. Then go into the Finder and paste them into a folder somewhere. Once you've done this, delete them from your iTunes playlist. However, this approach does mean needing to keep on top of this for whenever new voice memos are synced from your iPhone to computer.\n\n*Use a different Voice Recording app instead of the built-in iPhone app. There are many out there and many also offer ways to sync and back them up separately from the usual iTunes process.\n\n*No longer share the same computer. A more expensive option, no doubt! :)\n\n\nYou may want to provide feedback to Apple about this also. My personal preference would be that Voice Memos are handled totally outside the Music Library and have it's own designated category and options. Whatever your preference, you may want to send the same feedback for both iTunes and iPhone.\n\nA: When you sync iPhone and Mac with iTunes (12.8.1.2), voice memos are always copied from iPhone to Mac and never deleted from Mac.\nYou can delete voice memos manually from iTunes library but this is cumbersome (when you have already deleted from iPhone).\nThe checkbox \"include voice memos\" in iTunes does not help (voice memos are always included).  \nTo prevent voice memos being copied to Mac, locate this folder\n~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Voice Memos\n\nempty it to trash, change its permission to read only.\nNow, voice memos are not synced but, of course, you get a disk write error (ignore it).\n", "Q: Slideshow IDE for programmers? Is there a slideshow editor similar to Powerpoint, but for Mac, that supports code pens and maybe markdown?\nThanks\n\nA: I don't know if you would call it \"similar\" to PowerPoint as PowerPoint isn't focused on MarkDown or code, but a nice Mac app is \"Deckset\" 1.\nAnother option is to use the browser-based Remark 2. However it is not a native Mac app as such.\n", "Q: What Bit Encryption does Apple Use on Mobile Devices? Apple Encryption Question: I know if you have the iPhone 3GS or later version, an iPod touch 3rd generation or later version, or any iPad, the user can employ encryption to protect the contents. My question is specific, does any one know what bit encryption Apple uses? \n\n\nA: As per page 11 of the iOS Security Guide:\n\nEvery time a file on the data partition is created, Data Protection creates a new 256-bit\n  key (the “per-file” key) and gives it to the hardware AES engine, which uses the key to\n  encrypt the file as it is written to flash memory using AES CBC mode. (On devices with\n  an A8 processor, AES-XTS is used.) The initialization vector (IV) is calculated with the\n  block offset into the file, encrypted with the SHA-1 hash of the per-file key. \n\nEmphasis mine\n", "Q: AppleScript: how to open the terminal fullscreen and execute commands I need an applescript, which can do the job below:\n\n\n*\n\n*open the application Terminal with fullscreen\n\n*run some scripts\nHere is what I've tried:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    tell window 1\n        activate\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            keystroke \"f\" using {control down, command down}    \n        end tell\n        do script \"cd Documents/'cpp project'/test3\" in window 1\n        do script \"./matrix.out\" in window 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nBut it doesn't work.\n\nA: You need to be talking to Terminal, not window 1.

However, I don't want to clone every single thing and I also don't want to lose the development environment setups (XAMPP, Virtual Machines, Eclipse) I have in my 13 inch Mac. What would be the best way to make the switch smoothly without losing these environments that are time-consuming to setup, but also leave behind a bunch of files cluttering up the SSD? \n\nA: I would think that the easiest way is to use the Migration Assistant to copy your user account from the 13\" to the 15\" MacBook Pro.\nThis would ofcourse copy both the stuff you want to hang on to, and the stuff you don't want to hang on to. After migration has completed, you will need to delete the stuff you don't want.\nThe 13\" MacBook Pro will continue to work as before - you will not loose your development environment there.\nThe only real alternative to this is to manually copy over only the bits you want - I'm guessing that it is much easier to delete what you don't need instead.\nAlso remember that with SSDs small files \"cluttering\" the drive is not the same technical issue as it could be with hard drives (i.e. fragmentation, etc).\n", "Q: Safari, Mail and App Store won't open Some apps (Mail, Safari and App Store) crash when I try to start them.

El Capitan installer? I've got a problem that while installing El Capitan from USB Installer it says \"copy of software is corrupted etc..etc\". Actually I downloaded the copy of El Capitan from another Mac and then I created \"El Capitan installer from my own Mac with terminal process and when I try to install it it says the above message  \"copy of software is corrupted etc..etc\". So tell me please anyone what happened and if it's date fault, then what date I should set because I didn't download El Capitan on the Mac on which I want to install it.\nPlease can anyone help me to sort out this problem??\n\nA: You can try the following:\nGo to System Preferences and manually change the date to January 1st 2016. More specifically, deselect Set date and time automatically and then manually enter the date and click Save.\nAfter doing this, double click on the El Capitan installer and follow the prompts to install the software.\nIf you run into problems, a couple of additional things you can try are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect from the internet before manually changing the date and stay disconnected until you've done the installation \n\n*Copy the installer onto the hard drive rather than running it from the USB\n\n\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: I just wanted to to confirm that @Monomeeth is absolutely right. I tried what he said and it worked! Than you!!\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into USB with the macOS on it. \n\n*Disconnect from Wi-Fi if connected. Just turn it off for now..\n\n*Click Utilities tab, then Open Terminal.\n\n*Type date 0101121216 (which sets date to Jan 1st 2016 12:12 PM)\n\n*Type cd /Volumes/Image and do not press Return yet, Press Tab instead, then press Return.\n\n*Type cd Inst, and again, press Tab then Return.\n\n*Type cd Contents/MacOS/ and press Return this time.\n\n*Type ./Ins press Tab then Return and the installer should pop up and go from there to install the OS.\n\n", "Q: is data stored in iphone encrypted by default? according to the following website:\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/stop-thieves-recovering-data-factory-reset/\nit is stated that iphones encrypt all data stored in them:\nThe iOS operating system on Apple iPhones and iPads has to deal with a similar problem. To ensure a user’s data can be quickly and completely wiped when the device is factory reset, it has a trick up its sleeve. All data on the device is encrypted by default using the hardware encryption feature. When you choose to set up encryption, the device is protected with your own encryption key. Even if you never set up encryption, the files are stored on the device in encrypted form so any bits of deleted files appear as random gibberish on the device’s storage after it’s reset. The data can’t be recovered.\nim confused.\nis all data stored in iphones encrypted by default?\nspecifically iphone 5s\n\nA: Yes, the data is encrypted by default. However it is not \"secure\" in the sense that if you do not set up a sufficiently good pass code, it is easy to read the data if you have access to the phone.\n", "Q: Terminal Keeps Opening I am a musician running ProTools and Maschine on my MacBook Air. I recently used Terminal.app to delete some standard Apple apps and clear disk space. \nThe space was cleared but now Terminal keeps opening and interrupting me. I enter the logout command and it logs out successfully but keeps coming back. I have run Etrecheck and there was nothing insidious on the system. \nIs anyone aware of how to address this issue? \nPlease note that I have not (and cannot!) update OS X because I've heard that it has operating problems with ProTools 12. \nSystem specs:\nMacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012)\n1.8 GHz Intel Core i5\n8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nMacintosh HD\nIntel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB\nOS X Yosemite Version 10.10.5  \n\nA: I've been having this exact problem all day and think I just found the solution too it. \nI too thought that the problem was being caused by Terminal but I think it's just Application Manager acting up. For whatever reason Application Manager kept opening along with Terminal, only with no indication that it was open. Try quitting Application Manager and see if that works. \nI know most of the people have this same issue also have Pro Tools so it could just be something stupid Application Manager is doing. Hope it works for you or get you on the phone with ProTools support to help fix the cofiguration or bug in that app/suite that is opening the terminal app. \n\nA: Well, I'm usually not the one to figure things out. LOL. But, I trashed Application Manager and the Terminal opening problem stopped. Not sure if that was a bad idea, but I'm backed up :-)\n", "Q: What is writing all these files and folders to my Documents? Inside my Documents folder there are a bunch of folders named with what appear to be hexidecimal numbers, eg. 01, 1b, 84, aa, etc. Often they're empty, but some have one or two files named with a hash: 5aaebbb6c171adb2159c17cd1c8e629fc774f1be.file I assume the files are binaries because when I open them in a text editor they consist of rows of eight two digit hex values, 00eb babf 314c 00eb babf 3130 d3aa 0109. \nI deleted the folders a few weeks ago, but they slowly grew back.\nMy question is twofold:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is writing these files/folders?  \n\n*And because I doubt it can be diagnosed from my description, how\ndo I monitor and figure out what is writing them?\nI'm on 10.11, El Capitan.\nI sometimes run a Windows VM in VirtualBox, I run Vagrant from the command line, and Docker as well. I run phpstorm, Spotify, uTorrent, Steam, Slack, Skitch, Xcode, Tunnel Bear. The list goes on. I guess what I'm looking for is a strategy or technique to figure out which application is writing.\n\nA: A few things for you to try: \nPer this SO link, do lsof path-to-filename to list all processes accessing that file. There's also a frontend to lsof called Sloth. The problem with this is if the programme doing the writes only edits the file momentarily (like if it did touch foldername) then you probably wouldn't see it, since lsof only lists current processes' access to the file.\nAlternatively, get FSeventer (direct download link from archive.org - in my (klanomath's) opinion the only reliable source), which graphically monitors filesystem IO events. You could probably set it to run on your documents folder and then wait for one of those writes to happen, although based on your description that may take a while. The website for FSeventer seems to be down right now :(, but if/when it goes back up it may be able to solve your problem. FSeventer isn't really ElCap ready and often fails to work after the first launch - usually it works after launching it a second time.\n\nA: This is specific to my set up, and I didn't do anything in particular to find out what was writing to Documents. But, maybe this will help someone in the future. Spotify was set up to write cache to Documents.\n", "Q: IPad mail app does not show old emails – I can't mark them all as read I have started using my iPad again after long inactivity. The mail app shows 7,288 unread email. I would like to get rid of that red number, the problem is that the mail app does not load old email – and so I can't mark them as read. By the way, is there a way to mark ALL that 7,288 as read in one go?\n\nA: Actually I found out that the problem was simply due to the fact that I had a lot of unread messages in the \"social\" and \"promotion\" folders on Gmail. Best way to get rid of all of those unread emails: do a search using the query is:unread on Gmail's web interface.\n\nA: If using Gmail, there are no user-accesible parameters to limit how much email does iOS download to your device, but in my experience old email is downloaded \"on-demand\", while browsing mailboxes.  \nThe easiest way to get rid of the unread sign is to go through http://gmail.com and delete, archive or mark as read all unread email.  That will sync sooner or later with your device if it is properly configured.\nIf by chance it is configured with the POP3 protocol (instead of IMAP), the easiest way would be to erase and add again. This may prove problematic because depending on the configuration and set-up, you may lose email by deleting the account on your device.\nIt may resolve on its own: if you haven't used it in a while and it's configured with IMAP, and those emails are marked as \"read\" on the server, it may be that the device it's just delayed in updating the information.\n", "Q: What is the \"keep alive taking too long to send\" error indicating?

Perfectly normal and popular apps for any iPhone user. \nEdit: Just so you know, SE keeps a copy of edits to questions.\n", "Q: Messages app stopped sending iMessages I've been having trouble sending messages (SMS and iMessage) from my Mac for a week or so now. I'm not sure if it exactly correlates with my upgrading to Sierra (10.12.1) but I have a suspicion that it's related to that.\nEverything used to work flawlessly but now I can't send from my Mac. New messages that I receive appear on my Mac and iPhone (it's a 6 running 10.0.2) just fine. And new messages I send from my phone also appear on my Mac just fine too.\nThe below screenshot shows what happens when I click the (!) icon.\n\n\nA: I have had a similar problem in the past when upgrading OS. The easiest way to fix it I found was to disable iMessage on the faulty machine and then re-enable it. \nTo do this:\nMessages > Preferences > Accounts > Click your iMessage account > uncheck \"enable this account\" > sign out > restart Messages > sign back in. \nYou may need to follow the steps above to recheck the \"enable this account\" box.\n", "Q: Why is \"Send Movie to Final Cut Pro\" completely missing from iMovie 10.1.3?

Not greyed out, just totally not there at all! Why? How can I get it back so I can get my movie into FCP?\nMy only idea is that it isn't an option because I'm running the 30-day trial of FCP (downloaded from Apple's web site), but I can't imagine why they would remove the option.\nHere's my iMovie's File menu:\n\n\nA: Aha, figured it out: Had to quit and restart iMovie.

I have tried a NVRAM reset and yes, it worked but after 2 Days it doesnt work anymore. I am just struggling to get this work, i already looked in the settings and used the keyboard on screen and guess what? \n\nA: In keyboard preferences, enable the \"Show input in menu bar\" option under the Input Sources tab.\nThen in the menu bar Show the Keyboard Viewer.\nYou can press the escape key with the mouse and then connect an external keyboard and see when the key is being pressed.\nIf the external works and the internal fails - you need hardware repair. If neither escape physical key presses - then your software or keyboard mapping are messed up.\nYou could either figure out why or make a backup and erase install. Hard to guess which of those would take you less time, but those are the quick options for you if it's software and not hardware.\n", "Q: Can I invite to share my screen with iOS user?

I have experienced few situations where my battery life was about 30-40% and iPhone immediately turned off. When I tried to turn on it indicated low battery and kept doing this for about 2 hours everytime I tried to turn on. And then suddenly turned on and was back at around 30% battery life and I did not use charger in the meantime (I did not have it).\nThen this situation happened to me again when I had my charger with me, so plugged in and after while iPhone turned on charging but already had about 40% of battery charged.\nThis happened to me like 5x in last 3 months. The scenario is always very similar, battery life about 30-40%.. (never happens when the battery is more than 50%) and then few hours idle until comes back. Does anyone has any suggestions? Many thanks for help\n\nA: When I was a Genius at an Apple Store about two years ago, this issue was relatively common. Most likely this is a hardware issue with the battery itself, but there is a chance it could be a battery calibration issue. It's best to troubleshoot calibration first.\nCalibration Issue\nThe battery itself keeps track of how much battery life it has, and reports this back to the phone, which it then displays on the screen for you. Sometimes, the battery may be fully charged, but the battery or phone instead reports a different charge percentage.\nFixing a calibration issue is relatively easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use your phone until it completely runs out of battery power and shuts off.\n\n*Plug your phone into a charger, and leave it plugged in until it is fully charged. Ideally, do this overnight so you know to be sure it gets completely charged.\n\n\nThis process will tell the phone and battery where its lowest and highest charge points are.\nHardware Issue\nIf you continue having the issue, it is almost certainly an issue with the battery itself. If you have an Apple Store nearby, make a Genius Bar appointment there and bring your phone in. They can replace your battery there the same day, and it usually takes less than an hour.\nIf you don't have an Apple Store nearby, there may be an Apple Authorized Service Provider near you that can help. Go through the prompts at Apple's support site, and they will help you find a good option.\n\nA: Battery percentage is usually an estimation as it can be quite difficult to work out actual percentage.\nA great way to see the health of your battery is by using a tool such as CoconutBattery (Mac, free) which will allow you to view the cycle count, current capacity and how much it can store of its original design capacity.\nRemember, batteries are considered a consumable and once they've been cycled too many times will need to be replaced.\nThis could also be a software issue as some other users have mentioned, so your best bet is to backup the device then restore it through iTunes, setting it up as new to test.\n\nA: I'm experiencing the same problem and believe iOS 10 software is the cause and not hardware. \nIf iOS 10 is not registering the correct amount of battery power. Occasionally prior to my iPhone 6S going to sleep it's registering a decent amount of power to wake from sleep (as much as 50%). The phone will not wake from sleep and is effectively useless. However connect it to a power source or a computer, the power issue resets and the phone will wake reporting over 30% power and more. It seems to reset some flag that tells the phone that the battery is dead. It has happened too many times to be a coincidence. iOS is not registering the correct battery level, mistakenly thinks it does not have enough power and will therefore not power up. Once connected to a power source for a few seconds, the phone will reboot normally and show power levels correctly.. This has occurred through all iterations of iOS 10 including the latest betas.\n\nA: Problem solved, I have my battery changed and the issue hasnt occurred (well for 2 weeks so far).\nI first tried this calibration mentioned above, but it didnt help. Then I restored the iphone completely, didnt help either.\nI didnt expect the issue to be in battery as it has been just 2 years since I bought the device new and previously I had iphone4 for 4 years and there was no issue with battery but apparently it is not same, battery itself seemed to be the issue.\n", "Q: Mobile data connection lost on iPhone 5S I have iPhone 5S with 10.1.1 iOS and sometimes happens to me that I loose mobile data connection. In other words in top left corner on my screen there is provider (operator) and right next to it I usually have LTE. This LTE disappears from unknown reason (even in places that are 100% covered by LTE, but that is ok, I can accept it) but the problem is that it doesn't come back until I restart iPhone completely. I tried to restart data connection or some other things, but nothing worked. Only turning off and on again completely. Has anyone experienced this or have suggestions? Many thanks\n\nA: This is probably not a problem with your phone. It is up to the carrier to decide which individual handsets are actually allowed on LTE on the current cell tower. So you might just be experiencing that your carrier hasn't got enough capacity to allow everyone on LTE, so they put you on a slower network.\nSo even though a coverage map tells you that LTE is available - it doesn't necessarily mean it is available to everyone.\n", "Q: What could be the possible downsides of sticking with an old version of OSX? I've bought a Macbook Pro a pair of years ago, and it came with OSX 10.9.5 (Mavericks). Since I am very happy with this version of OSX, I've ignored all the updates since then, and I'm still running OSX 10.9.5. \nI'm afraid that upgrading OSX would leave me unsatisfied, so basically I'm sticking with a version I like (and by the way, I also prefer this version from an esthetic point of view!).\nHowever, I'm wondering if there could be some problems when never upgrading OSX. What are the problems that could emerge in the long run if the OS is not upgraded?\n\nA: there MAY be a small risk of issue long term with staying back on OS levels. However that issue is pretty minimal.  You should make sure 10.9 is updated to the latest flavor, to prevent any major issues. (I happen to know that 10.9.5 isn't missing anything from 10.10 or 10.11).\nThe tradeoff is that an older OS will also (GENERALLY SPEAKING) work better on a machine that's not brand new. \nPersonally I own 100+ Macs, and run all my personal systems on 10.9.5... I hate 10.10 and 10.11 - both are filled with issues, both slow down computers.\nMy recommendation would be to stick with the older OS as long as you can, understanding that you'll eventually run into issues with add-on's (Flash, youtube, etc)... The core OS will run just perfectly forever (I've got a couple in-house servers running 10.5!), but you'll want to eventually upgrade when some of these ancillary products give you problems....\n", "Q: Calendar auto-increment name of event If I set an event to repeat every day, is it possible to auto-increment a number at the end of its name?\nE.g. every day at 21:00 I'd like an alert which says \"Day #\" where # is the number of days since the event started.\n\nA: An AppleScript is one approach to doing this.\nSee MacScripter / Calendar: Incrementing Name property for recurring events which has a script making each year an event that says \"John Doe's #th Anniversary\".

What is the conventional way that everyday programmers export their application without revealing the source code (Xcode specific)?\nPlease help me understand so that I can deploy the app. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: When you save the AppleScript file you have the option of checking \"Run Only\" - in that case the script is compiled into a new form that can be run exactly as the original script, but it is not meant for further editing/development. \nIt doesn't mean that the run-only file is complete protected or non-readable, but parts of your code, comments, etc. are not included or not easily readable.\nIf you want to do more you'll need a code obfuscator if you still want to use AppleScript - however I'm not sure if one exists on the market, or you need to develop your own.\nRegarding the second part of your question - most programmers do not use AppleScript. For other languages such as Objective-C, C, C++, etc. the problem is not the same as their programs are ordinarily compiled before they can run, and in the process of compilation they are translated into a non-human readable form.\nSome implementations of languages do not exhibit this behaviour - for example ordinary PHP scripts are interpreted or compiled at run-time.

Some key seems to have stuck and keeps pressing into the password field forever, filling the password field and making me unable to type anything in. If I select all/delete, it refills again immediately, just like I'm pressing and holding a key on the keyboard. I've pressed all the keys as maybe OS thinks one is stuck, hoping that it will fix, but pressing all keys didn't work either. The only solution for me is to restart (and even if I press esc to sleep again, it immediately wakes up in a second as its \"pressing\" a key), if I close the lid, wait a minute, and open it again, it's still the same.\nIf I restart, I lose the work inside my apps. Usually nothing serious, but sometimes I've got apps open doing work in the background etc (e.g. batch image processing, neural net training, or any stuff that I can't save properly until the end) and they are all gone. This happens rarely, but when it happens, it causes me to lose data.\nWhy would this happen and how can I prevent this?\n\nA: I had EXACTLY this problem - and the solution made me feel a bit stupid in the end. I had a bluetooth keyboard stored in a bag a few meters away, which must have had a key pressed.\nFunny thing is it only repeated on the login screen?\nBut pulling it out the bag (or turning off bluetooth) sorted it straight away.\n\nA: I found this question from my phone while experiencing the same problem (High Sierra).  I have no bluetooth keyboard, just the laptop by itself and I had tried pressing all the keys individually (ruling out physical stickiness).\nI was able to solve the problem by selecting \"switch user\".  After selecting myself from the list of users, it switched me back to the login screen and the repeating key abruptly stopped (it entered 2 characters in the password field and that was it). \nNo shutdown was required.  I'm not sure if this is an expected solution to the problem or if I just got lucky.  Also, I'm not sure whether this workaround was enabled by having multiple accounts on the machine (such that \"switch user\" is a valid action in the first place).  I'm also not sure if (as a distant possibility) the fix was related to my having to move and click the trackpad a bit.\nBut it worked, and hopefully it will work for you too.\n\nA: Have you tried resetting your computer's System Management Controller (SMC)?\nFor your particular MacBook Pro, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAlso, another thing worth doing is resetting your NVRAM. \nTo reset your NVRAM do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine.

This is my first question on AskDifferent.\nI'm a photographer and have been using an external SSD to keep my Lightroom Library (develop and album metadata only, the picture files are on other devices). I usually have the SSD drive connected to a powered USB3 hub.\nI am on assignment in Tanzania and a couple of days ago there was a power outage and soon after a generator was turned on. During the short outage, the laptop switched to battery power, but the USB hub lost power. After power was restored, my laptop and other external drive that were connected at the time are fine, but this crucial external SSD is not mounting anymore. Disk Utility doesn't show either the disk or volume. Plugging in/out, rebooting or shutting down do nothing. It seems to me like the SSD is \"(dead?)\". Any idea if there is a way to \"force-recognise\" the drive in case it is still working? If not, could it be that a part of the drive \"got fried\"? If that is the case, is it possible to somehow send it in for repair/recover to salvage the data? Unfortunately I haven't done a backup of my catalog for about 2 months, so many hours of work on the pictures and albums would be lost.\nThe volume is formatted as exFat (because I also use it with a video recorder that needs this formatting).\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nA: I'm assuming that you tried to connect the USB enclosure directly to your Mac to eliminate the USB hub as a point of failure.  If you haven't give that a shot as your hub may have taken the brunt of the surge\nIf it still doesn't work, there's a good chance that your drive may be fine but the USB to SATA interface of the enclosure got fried.  \nFor a \"quick and dirty\" fix, get a USB to SATA adapter.  I keep one of these handy for doing all sorts of diagnostic work exactly for exactly the scenario you are experiencing.\n\nThis is basically a USB enclosure for your SSD without the \"enclosure\" part.   You will just need to open up your existing enclosure and remove the drive.  Don't worry about damaging the enclosure, right now it's dead and you're dead in the water if you can't get your data.  Just be careful not to damage the drive or the drive's SATA/power connectors.\nOnce you have the drive extracted and connected, you should be able to access it like you did before.\nThis bring us to the points that bears repeating...\n\n\n*\n\n*Always make backups of your Lightroom catalog.  If on assignment, do it daily.  I am totally an amateur photographer and I back up my LR catalogs every time I open LR.\n\n*You learned (unfortunately) the hard way about power surges.  When that generator kicked on it probably sent a surge of current down the line.  A backup generator doesn't provide the nice, clean power you've come to expect from the utility company.  Get a quality surge protector (like APC) or better yet, get a battery backup (again, like APC) to sit between your outlet and your expensive equipment.  It's much more cost effective to have a $100 UPS die than all your equipment and work.\n", "Q: How to switch off sharing of history between iTerm2 tabs when setopt command not found I am experiencing the same problem as in this question: The history is shared between my iTerm2 terminal tabs: how can I switch that off?.

I never suspected that this could cause the weird shared-history-in-iTerm-behaviour, since I have had this in my ~/.bashrc already before the problem started.\nThe relevant part of my ~/.bashrc looks like this:\n##########################################################\n# Eternal bash history.\n# ---------------------\n# Undocumented feature which sets the size to \"unlimited\".\n# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9457233/unlimited-bash-history\nexport HISTFILESIZE=\nexport HISTSIZE=\nexport HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"[%F %T] \"\n# Change the file location because certain bash sessions truncate .bash_history file upon close.\n# http://superuser.com/questions/575479/bash-history-truncated-to-500-lines-on-each-login\nexport HISTFILE=~/.bash_eternal_history\n# Force prompt to write history after every command.\n# http://superuser.com/questions/20900/bash-history-loss\n\nexport CUSTOM_HISTFILE=\"~/.bash_history_workingdir\" #path of the new history file\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a; history -c; history -r; date | xargs echo -n >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; echo -n ' - ' >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; pwd | xargs echo -n >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; echo -n ' - ' >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; tail -n 1 $HISTFILE >>$CUSTOM_HISTFILE; $PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\n\nA: It's the history -a part of PROMPT_COMMAND in your .bashrc - that's appending to the history file every time a prompt is displayed, whatever tab you're using. A quick fix would be to remove this, so that each tab's session only writes to .bash_history when the session ends (e.g. when the tab is closed).\nI like this behaviour (immediate appends to .bash_history), and I suspect you may too! A better solution may be to maintain separate histories for each session/tab - one of the answers to this question describes how to achieve that. You could retain immediate appends, but to separate files - one for each session. You would still be able to search your entire bash history with a command like grep \"foo\" ~/.bash_hist*. (I've not personally tried this: I use one history file for all sessions, since my normal workflow tends to be in one tab or through screen, and I archive my /bash_history periodically into a separate file, as described in this article - which is well worth reading, even if it doesn't address your issue).\n", "Q: How to get info of specific iNodes inside Terminal when I type ls -li I get all files including their iNode-id.

How Do I Type with IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)? I need to type in Phonetics, but I cannot find a keyboard. I tried the IPA Unicode 6.2 keyboard, but it did not work. It installed, but when I selected it, I could only type the normal english-latin characters. I cannot use copy/paste sites like This, as I need to type a lot.\nI am using a MacBook Pro, With Sierra\n\nA: You should normally not have a problem making the IPA keyboard work. It uses \"dead keys\" to create the IPA characters. A “dead key” is a key that does not generate a character, but rather changes the character generated by a following keystroke. For example, in the IPA keyboard, to get the “ə”,you would type the dead key “=” followed by the “e” (=e).  Charts showing the how all the IPA characters are made this way can be found in this PDF.\n\n\nA: If the standard IPA layout doesn't work for you, I would suggest making a custom keyboard layout with Ukelele (or if you prefer text-based editing, KeyLayoutMaker).\nAlternatively, if you don't need quite the level of speed that can offer, you can simply use the Character Palette (Edit > Emoji and Symbols) to type the characters by double-clicking them. To get the \"Phonetic Alphabet\" pane to show up, customize which are visible with the gear icon in the top left.\n\n", "Q: Partitions uses in default Mac OS installation? I plan to install Linux on my Macbook Pro and before removing an important partition, I'd like to know what I need to keep in order to be able to do a recovery to MacOS in case I need to.\nFor information, here's what I currently have on my macbook :\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI : 200Mo\n\n*Apple Core storage : 465.1Go\n\n*Apple Recovery : 619.9Mo\n\n\nHere's the fdisk output : (sorry, in French)\n\nI believe I can remove the \"Apple Core Storage\", but can I also remove the EFI or no?\nThe idea is to be able to launch a Apple Recovery in case I need it and get back my computer like it was when I bought it.\nThank you for your help.\n\nA: You need to keep the EFI partition in order to be able to boot OSX. You could, however, install an alternative boot loader, such as \"rEFInd\".\nYou do not need to keep the \"Apple Recovery\" partition, but you should, because if you mess up the normal Mac partition so that you cannot boot from it any more, you might still be able to boot into the Recovery partition and fix the OSX system from it.\nYou could also copy both the EFI and Recovery partitions to a new disk, e.g. to an external disk, and then boot from it. If that works, then you'd be safer playing with the partitions on your main drive, seeing what works, and still be able to boot from the external disk, because the Mac's boot ROM will search every connected internal and external disk for an EFI partition in order to see if it can boot from it.\nTo test this, hold down the Option (alt) key when the Mac starts up - then you will get a list of bootable partitions.\nFor installing Linux, I suggest you do these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a large enough external disk and make a backup of each of your partitions, using a block copy method, or by using OS X's Disk Utility, with the \"New disk image from ...\" command from the File menu. You could also try my tool \"iBored\" for this.\n\n*Boot OSX and open Disk Utility. Select the disk, then \"Partitions\". Select the large OSX partition and click the [+] button to add a new partition. Make it large enough for your Linux system. This will then make the OSX partition smaller if there's enough free space on it. Now you have a new free partition to install Linux on.\n\n*See if you can install rEFInd and see if that supports booting into Linux (it should, but I have not tried it myself).\n\n*If something goes wrong, you can always restore from your external backup.\n", "Q: I want to power off multiple Macs everyday at 23:30 (11:30 pm)? I have this problem in my office that multiple Macs always run 24/7 and my boss said that I need to make it stop. Now I don't have much experience with Macs, I'm more the Windows type. \nI have one Mac who acts as a server and would like to run a script or something like that to orchestrate the power status of several computers if that helps.\nHow can I shut down all of those 7-8 Macs remotely at 11:30pm? \n\nA: If you need to manage a bunch of Macs, I recommend using Apple Remote Desktop. It should let you push any number of standard settings to the Macs you need to manage for your job and let you avoid having to write and maintain a script.\nOn each machine you need to enable Remote Management in System Preferences.app > Sharing. After that, you can adjust anytime you need to.\n\nA: As patrix has pointed out in a comment, you can set up any Mac to start up or wake up, and sleep or shut down at specific times, via the System Preferences -> Energy Saver -> Schedule... settings.\nYou could also try using AppleScript, e.g. this code (edit it with Script Editor, then save as an Application):\ntell application id \"com.apple.systemevents\" -- System Events.app\n    shut down\nend tell\n\nAnd then use OSX's Launch Services to run this script at a given time. To set this up, you could use a free tool such as \"Lingon X\".\nBesides, why shut them down like this? If all you care about is to preserve electrical power, why not instead set up the Macs to go to Sleep after being idle for, say, 30 minutes? That way, they will go to sleep much sooner usually, saving more power. If they do not go to sleep as expected, you can check with the Terminal command pmset -g what might prevent them from sleeping. Often it's a pending print task (which you may want to delete, then) or mounted server volumes.\n\nA: You can use pmset to do this and it will be a \"once and done\" solution.\nOnce you issue the pmset command, it will shutdown/startup/wake on the schedule you set; you won't have to create a script that runs at a predetermined time each time.\npmset uses this format:\npmset schedule day/date time\nHere are a few examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*pmset repeat sleep MTWRF 23:30:00 puts the Mac to sleep weekdays at 11:30pm\n\n*pmset repeat poweroff MTWRF 23:30:00 shuts down the Mac weekdays at 11:30pm\n\n*pmset schedule shutdown \"12/31/2016 23:59:00\" shuts down the computer at 11:59pm New Year's Eve.\n\n*pmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRF 06:30:00 wakes the Mac every weekday at 7:00am so that it's ready to go when the employee shows up.\nYou don't need to use a script to do this, all you need to do is remotely access each one of the Macs (all 7 or 8) of them and issue the command as an admin.  \nHowever, if you needed to run a script you could add this command to a simple bash script similar to the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Array of Mac hostnames separated by spaces\nmy_macs=(mac1 mac2 mac3 mac4)\n\n#Steps through each hostname and issues SSH command to that host\n\nfor n in my_macs\ndo\n   ssh admin@$n \"pmset repeat sleep MTWRF 23:30:00\"\ndone\n\nexit 0\n\nNow, keep in mind that the script is for illustration purposes and technically outside the scope of this answer.  I just wanted to illustrate how this could be done.\n", "Q: Backquote (<) and ² inverted on my external keyboard I don't know why, but the ² and < are inverted on my external keyboard.\nThe ² is right after the left shift, where it's written \"<\", and the < is at the top of the tab key, where it's written \"²\" ...\nAny idea why, and how I can fix that?\nThank you.\n\nA: I've got the same problem on an external Italian Keyboard, as said in the comments by Tom Gewecke the problem was Karabiner.\nI want to maintain Karabiner for one of the two keyboards so I've done a \"simple modification\":\n\nYou can do the same with your inverted keys.\nAnother solution of the problem is disable Karabiner for a specific Keyboard:\n\n\nA: I noticed these keys are swapped on my (Belgian) AZERTY keyboard when the keyboard type is set to ANSI (United States and others) instead of ISO (European).

I'd have to filter the result with grep, but can't figure out how to filter it so that I can look for an app's bundle ID but also get the version (which appears in a different line).\nThere's also mdfind, which might be suitable for my purpose.\nLet's, for instance, say I want to know about all installed \"Word\" apps, such as the 2008, 2011 and 365 versions.\nWith lsregister -dump | grep 'com\\.microsoft\\.Word', I'd get these lines:\nidentifier:    com.microsoft.Word (0x800460c2)\nactivityTypes: NOTIFICATION#:com.microsoft.Word, pv-e851f8544284d1\n\nThat's not helpful to inquire the version, is it?\nWith mdfind \"kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier == com.microsoft.Word\" I'd get the paths:\n/Applications/Microsoft Office 2008/Microsoft Word.app\n/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Word.app\n\nBut how would I get the version from that? I thought I'd filter the resulting paths with xargs but that doesn't work with the spaces in the paths.\n\nA: There is a fast way to look which version is installed for all apps from a particular folder.\nTaking an example, /Applications folder:\nfind /Applications/*/Contents -iname \"Info.plist\" -maxdepth 1 -exec defaults read {} CFBundleExecutable \\; -exec defaults read {} CFBundleVersion \\;\n\nThis will print app's name and version.\nTo print app's name:\ndefaults read nameOf.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleExecutable\nTo print app's version:\ndefaults read nameOf.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleVersion\nIf you need just for one particular app just change find search.\nAnything like this:\nfind /Applications/*Word/Contents -iname \"Info.plist\" -maxdepth 1 ...\nTo use this, you just must know app's folder location.\n\nA: A solution using mdfind and mdls as a one-liner:\nmdfind \"kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier == com.microsoft.Word\" | while read path; do echo \"$path\"; mdls -name kMDItemVersion \"$path\"; done\n\nThis would print (if both Office 2008 and 2011 are installed):\n/Applications/Microsoft Office 2008/Microsoft Word.app\nkMDItemVersion = \"12.3.6\"\n/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Word.app\nkMDItemVersion = \"14.6.9\"\n\nThat's good enough for my needs. I still wonder if there's a way to get the information from lsregister or a similar tool that looks into the Launch Services registry.\nUpdate (Dec 2022)\nSince the command above doesn't work in zsh, I've found another way to list the apps along with their versions:\nmdfind -attr kMDItemVersion \"kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier == com.microsoft.Word\"\n\n\nA: The version might be as easy as:\nmdls -name kMDItemVersion /Applications/Microsoft\\ Word.app/\n\nThe find is also easy with spotlight:\nmdfind \"kMDItemKind == 'Application'\" | head\n\nAbove I only got the first 10 responses with the | head command. You would need to chose a scripting language or idiom to handle the passing of the results from the find to the examination of the version. Or you could put them in temporary files. You'll need to handle spaces in the file names or just copy / paste things once you see which list of apps you need.\n", "Q: I am using iphone 6 and my battery Max capacity is 1118 mAH and design capacity is 1751? \nI am using iphone 6 ios 9.3.3 my battery Max capacity is 1118 mAH and design capacity is 1751 ?\nWhy its Max capacity is is not 1751 what to do to fix it. \n\nA: Your battery is worn out \nBatteries, particularly lithium-ion batteries loose the ability to hold charge as they age. The biggest indicator of how old a battery is is not just the age but the charge cycle count, which is the number of time the battery is charged to 100% and discharged again back to 0. Note that this doesn't have to happen all in one charge but is cumulative. \nApple has some good information on it here.\n645 charge cycles is a lot. The current estimate of the lifespan of an iPhone battery is  300 - 400 charge cycles There is nothing you can really do to fix this except use the iPhone in such a way to maximise the remaining life of the battery. More information can be found here.\n", "Q: OSX El Capitan, DNS issue Yesterday everything worked fine. But tonight, I'm unable to access particularly a few particular websites on all the imacs, mbp and even iphones at home.

Heeeeeeelp~\nHere's the particular site that can't be reached:  (www.mtggoldfish.com)\n\nA: The very first thing to have tried would have been to change from your provider's DNS servers to a known public one.\nGoogle is one of the most commonly known - also the numbers are easiest to remember\nSystem Prefs > Network > [currently used] > Advanced... > DNS\nThe number currently in there will be the one assigned by your DHCP server, i.e. your router, so you don't really need to remember it, but write it down if you wish.  \nHit the - button to remove it.\nHit the + button & add 8.8.8.8\nrepeat & add 8.8.4.4 \nOK\nApply\nReboot & test.\nDNS issues usually sort themselves out in a day or two so if it works, keep it for a while, then swap back to your ISP's servers. You should be able to do that by simply removing both the Google servers & hitting OK, Apply. It will find the right one from DHCP.\n", "Q: Why isn't my shortcut for accessing desktop not working? I'm using a Macbook Pro and I just upgraded to Mac Sierra.

Specifically, Fn + F11 or Command + F3 (Mission control key?) but neither combination works.\nHow do I enable keyboard shortcuts for the desktop or what are the proper key sto press?\n\nA: Whether or not you should use the Fn key depends on whether you have enabled \"Use F1, F2 etc. keys as standard function keys\" in Keyboard preferences. Try just pressing F11, without pressing Fn. And then look in the Mission Control system preference pane and see what key is assigned to Show Desktop.\n\nA: Just reset that.\nGo to:\nSystem Preferences\n→ Keyboard\n→ Shortcuts\n→ Mission Control\n→ Show Desktop\n→ Click on right command (F11)\n→ Press Command + D\nI prefer Command + D because reminds me Windows but you can setup Command + F3 or whatever other combination you like.\n", "Q: Symlinked MobileSync folder but still \"not enough free space\" I have an external hard drive and I plan to put iPhone backups on it.\nI did symlink to it this way:\nln -s /Volumes/external/Backup ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync\n\nWhen I'm trying to do a backup of my iPhone normally from iTunes, I get an error:\n\nHowever my drive has 1 TB of free space. What's wrong?\n\nA: iTunes doesn't know you've symlinked the MobileSync folder, so still checks the normal disk for its free space. Make sure there's enough free space on the disk containing your home folder, even though that space won't be consumed because of the symlink.\n\nA: I could just check today that iTunes is not that stupid, it checks the free space on the symlinked folder.\nIn my case there was a formatting problem that made macOS believe that the symlinked volume was much smaller than its real capacity.

I'd like to back up my local content with my own scripts, but I'm not familiar with how macOS apps work. For example, I can't find where Ulysses stores its local content.\nOr more generally: where do macOS apps usually store their files?\n\nA: It’s really up to each program to decide if it stores in the home folder / documents and lets users manage things or if it makes a database in plain view (like Photos or iTunes) with aspects of the database elsewhere or entirely hide the filesystem and manage all files / syncing. \nIn the case of Ulysses - the developer has decided to manage things in a bundle/database and either sync it to iCloud via a local cache or store the content locally in your user library folder - out of view of normal expectations in ~/Documents or ~/Desktop\nContent stored On My Mac\nIf you do not sync your local content using iCloud (i.e. it's in the On My Mac section in your Ulysses sidebar), you can access each group in your Ulysses library at the following file path:\n~/Library/Group Containers/X5AZV975AG.com.soulmen.shared/Ulysses/Documents/Library/Groups-ulgroup/\nEach group belongs it its own -ulgroup directory and will have an (unhelpful) hash for a name—for example, cba24c5b16a949c388b0204c9aa28867-ulgroup.\nWithin each -ulgroup directory, your documents will each have their own .ulysses file. And you guessed it, they also have a hash for a filename. Note that .ulysses files actually contain both a Content.xml and a Text.txt with your content in them.  \nContent synced via iCloud\nYou will have a hard time accessing your Ulysses iCloud-stored library from Finder, but I seem to be able to access mine fine using the Terminal if you're comfortable doing that. It's stored similarly as I described above, but here is the file path you'll be looking for instead:\n~/Library/Mobile Documents/X5AZV975AG~com~soulmen~ulysses3/Documents/Library/Groups-ulgroup\nA note on iCloud. The com~soulmen~ulysses3 is the application bundle/group name provided to Apple by the developer when they created the iCloud entitlements for this application. The X5AZV975AG is Apple’s provided identifier that combined with the reverse dns type name space, makes each iCloud bucket unique but common across everyone that uses that app.\n\nA: There's a way to do this where even if you lose access to Ulysses you will still have your files in a way that is useful for you and won't make you cry.\nMove your files in Ulysses' iCloud and \"On My Mac\" sections to two external folders. The exact directory structure gets copied & the sheet names are retained; it took me about a minute.\n\nOnce you've set it up to only use external folders you can do normal things with the files.\nFor comparison:\n\nEverything Ulysses keeps in the ~/Library area is all over the place. Hopeless. I thought I was going to have to make every folder (group) by hand and export each \"sheet\" one by one.\nNo one should have to go through this to move a directory structure full of text files from one place to another my God.

Can I shutdown multiple Macs in my office (9-10 Macs) in my office after checking their runtime? I have one Mac, which acts as a Server (with the OS Server application). SSH is also enabled on every Mac, so logging on remotely is not a problem. I want to write a script that checks: \nif the runtime >=24h then shutdown mac\n\nNow I don't know anything about scripting on a Mac but I've done this before with powershell and windows machines. \nCurently I have this script:\n#!/bin/bash\nBOOT_TIME=$(sysctl -n kern.boottime | sed -e 's/.* sec = \\([0-9]*\\).*/\\1/')\nCURR_TIME=$(date +%s)\nMAX_UPDAYS=1 #Days\n\nDAYS_UP=$(( ( $CURR_TIME - $BOOT_TIME) / 86400 ))\n    if [ $DAYS_UP -ge ${MAX_UPDAYS} ];then\n        echo Mac is going to shutdown \n        shutdown -h now\n    else\n        echo No shutdown needed\nfi\n\nbut don't know how to run it on the remote Macintoshs\n\nA: You can do this with a simple bash script, the uptime command and launchd.  If you execute the command by itself, it will tell you how long the machine has been up:\n$ uptime\n6:08  up 20 days, 21:09, 4 users, load averages: 1.09 1.29 1.36\n\nSo, the number that we are interested is the \"20\" which we will evaluate against our condition of \"1 day\"\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Maximum number of days to be up\nmax=1\n\n#Get the uptime days and assign it to a variable\nuptime_days=`uptime | cut -d \" \" -f 5`\n\nif [ $uptime_days -ge $max ]\n  then \n  shutdown -h now\nfi\n\nexit 0\n\nMake sure you set the script as executable or it won't run:\nchmod +x shutdown24.sh\nNow, here's the most important part.  When do you want to evaluate this?  Technically, your could have this script run every hour (or even ever minute) to evaluate if the computer has been up for 24 hours.  \nThis is not recommended because if for some reason the computer was turned on at 10:00am (because the person was late, for example) you don't want it shutting down at 10:00am the next morning when they are in the middle of their work.\nSo, I'm going to assume you want it run at midnight so you don't inadvertently shutdown the machine while people are working.  What you need is to utilize lauchd and create a .plist that defines the job (similar to Task Scheduler) in Windows.\nLet's assume that we called the bash script shutdown24.sh so we will call our .plsit com.user.shutdown24.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"\n  \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.user.shutdown24</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/USERNAME/Path_to_Scripts/shutdown24.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Hour</key>\n        <integer>00</integer>\n        <key>Minute</key>\n        <integer>00</integer>\n    </dict>\n\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nCopy this file to /Library/LaunchDaemons and then load it to launchd:\nsudo launchctl load com.user.shutdown24.plist\nThe job will be run as root and at 12:00am every morning, it will check if the system uptime and will shutdown if it's greater than 24 hours. \n\nA: Note: I was composing my answer to another question/post of yours where you were asking pretty much the same thing but you were using 2 separate scripts.

Knowing that I use the MacBook for programming, surf the web and write in latex do you think that the update to the new OS X version will provide me benefit in performance? \n\nHere the specifics of my MacBook Pro Mid 2010: \n\n\nA: It is a tough question to estimate if you will get a performance boost from MacOS Sierra, as every system responds differently.\nI have a mid 2011 iMac that I upgraded from El Capitan to Sierra, and I  found a noticeable decrease in performance. So much so that I rolled back and made a clean install of El Capitan.\nThere are however a number of good reasons to update. The first and most important being security. Apple will stop supporting and producing updates fro El Capitan soon. When this happens your system will become more vulnerable over time\nI would recommend that if you do want to upgrade, back up your system to a Time Machine drive and disconnect it from the system before the update. If you decide that you want to roll back, you can follow a guide on making a clean El Capitan install here. Once you have done that, you can then restore from the Time Machine backup. \n", "Q: mac goes for sleep on screen lock On screen lock mac goes to sleep impacting the downloads & etc.  Is there any way I can lock the screen with password protection and not loose the connections ?\nOS version: EL Captain\nCurrently \n\nA: Have you tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Energy Saver \n\n*Set computer sleep to Never (or an appropriately long period of time)\n\n*Set display sleep to occur when you like\n\n*Now go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy\n\n*Click on General\n\n*Tick the box for Require password...after sleep or screen saver begins\n\n*Click on the drop-down menu to select how long after sleep you want the need for a password to be activated (Immediately, 5 secs, 1 min, etc etc)\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\nNote, if you want you can also use the Screen Saver function to achieve the same thing.

These iMacs also came with a 1TB Fusion (or Hybrid) drive option as well as a 256GB SSD option, both of which are significantly faster (especially the SSD).\nStorage\nSo, to answer your question as asked, you can in fact replace the hard drive in your model iMac if you want, although Apple does not 'officially' consider the storage (i.e. HDD/SSD) in any of the Tapered Edge aluminum iMacs to be upgradable. However, to be fair to Apple, upgrading this is extremely difficult and I would not recommend anyone having a go at it unless they're experienced or are very technically competent.\nBased on your specs, your iMac has the model identifier iMac14,4 (you can double-check this via the About This Mac option under the Apple Menu - click the System Report button). Instructions on upgrading your storage, along with videos, are available here. \nRemember though, this is not easy!\nRAM\nYour particular model iMac only came with 8GB RAM and this was soldered onto the Logic Board, so cannnot be removed and replaced. There are no additional memory slots. In other words, this cannot be upgraded whatsoever.\nExternal Storage\nIn terms of external storage, the fastest option would be to use an SSD in an external enclosure connected to one of your Thunderbolt ports. Here are some example options. However, you'd have to factor in the cost of the SSD and enclosure and decide whether that money would be better put towards a different Mac? The fact is that your model iMac is not really suited to heavy work as it's throttled by a lack of both processing power and RAM.\nComparison test\nAlso, as a test, I used a mid-2010 iMac with a 500GB hard drive installed and launched Xcode and compiled a few builds to the simulator and in all instances these were a lot quicker than the 15 mins you talk about. Of course, without compiling the same code this is not a fair comparison. However, this iMac did have 12GB of RAM installed and that is a 50% boost compared to what you will ever have for yours. \nMy recommendations\n\n\n*\n\n*I would bite the bullet and start saving for another Mac. \n\n*Upgrading the internal hard drive is very difficult and I assume beyond your competency (no offense intended)! \n\n*In the meantime, I would ensure you keep your simulator running after first launch to significantly reduce subsequent builds etc.\n\n*You could also run an Apple Diagnostics Test to check your hardware to ensure there isn't some other undiagnsed problem. To do this, restart your iMac and immediately hold down the D key. When prompted, run the tests. If you get the option to run an extended test, select this as well. Note this may take some time to run!\n\n\nAny problems/questions, let me know.\n", "Q: MacBook pro retina 15\" mid 2015 - two monitors 4k@60Hz I'm considering to buy the above mentioned MacBook with the Intel Iris Pro Graphics and without the additional AMD graphic card.\nNow my question is whether this configuration supports connecting two external monitors with 4k resolution @60 HZ or not.

I am curious if there exists a tweak that can spoof your device being locked so that it registers as if the screen were locked and blacked out and gives you points, but you can still use the device normally. If this doesn't exist, is it even possible to create?\n\nA: You can try using Flex to see if there is a simple method that it uses to detect whether the device is locked, at which point you can override the return boolean to always return true. Without being able to run the app, I can't create a patch myself, but search for methods with names such as ‘lock’.\n", "Q: Why would MacBook Pro indicate \"not on same network\" as iPhone...when that is not the case?

I have several folders named \"auto_saves\" around my hard drive. I want to make smart search to find all image files from all folders named \"auto_saves\". But how?\n\nA: I don’t think this is possible in Finder.\nYou can get the desired search result using HoudahSpot. HoudahSpot is a third party file search tool that uses the existing Spotlight index. Full disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahSpot.\nWith HoudahSpot you can search in several folders at once. This would however require that you list all “auto_saves” folders you want to search.\nI recommend, you search for image files in HoudahSpot and then use the “path filter” feature to show only search results where the file path contains “/auto_saves”. In HoudahSpot you will find the filter field right above the list of search results. Set it to “Filter by Path” and enter “/auto_saves”.\nYou can save your HoudahSpot search as a template so you can return to it later.\n", "Q: Time stamp for pictures actually taken before being sent to recipient on iphone My boyfriend sent me a picture from his Iphone 6, I have an iphone 5.

How would I migrate to this 15 inch laptop and use the SSD from the 13 inch one? \nWhat is the most efficient way of going about this? \nRight now, I cannot think of any other solution but to  use Migration Assistant to transfer data from SSD to the HDD in the 15 inch and then taking out the SSD in the 13 inch MBP and cloning it with the HDD that just got all the data from the 13 inch. I am hoping there is a better way than this. \n\nA: In the past, I have just swapped the drives in the two machines, and everything just worked fine.\nTake the SSD from the 13\" MBP and put it in the 15\" MBP.\nIn the unlikely event that there are any problems, you can always swap the drives back.\nEDIT: You might want to boot into recovery mode, and do a 'Verify Disk' in the Disk Utility, to make sure that everything is fine.

This is a very odd request, but I've had quite the fight with Apple now for over a year on my AppleID account.  It turns out that my legitimate Mac Pro's serial number has been somehow blacklisted with Apple's system, but the engineers and sys admins and the Apple Support + Apple Customer Relations rep all refuse to believe it (they say that they've had extensive dialogues with higher end engineers, but still cannot get resolution).  I've provided evidence that my account works fine on other machines with different serials, yet even on this Mac Pro with a completely fresh install, it absolutely will not work and the advanced debugging logs that only Apple engineers know (and I'm likely under NDA not to share) demonstrate the error message that indicates that it is a problem with their AppleID gateway server and my serial number.\nSo, to help my sanity and move beyond flat out arguing (I've even sent Tim Cook an email re: this), I am looking for a way to generate a new random serial number for my Mac Pro that will circumvent this insanity.  Does anyone know the process of doing this on a legitimate Mac Pro (I'm not seeing how the Hackintosh methodologies would tie in to an actual Mac Pro at present)?\n\nA: I may have misunderstood your question, but it's not clear what you mean by:\n my account works fine on other machines with different serials, yet even on this Mac Pro with a completely fresh install, it absolutely will not work.\nI'm not aware of any Apple ID account services that interrogate serial numbers. In fact, Apple instructs software developers the following caveat relating to serial numbers:\n\nIt is possible for a system to lose its serial number so that it will\n  no longer appear either in System Profiler or the I/O Registry.\n  Repairing a system by swapping hardware components is one reason this\n  can happen. Apple does not document the specific details of how a\n  machine can lose its serial number. Once the serial number has been\n  lost there is no means to restore it to the machine.\n\nSource: Apple Technical Note TN1103\nThe point I am trying to make is that Mac computers can lose their serial number, or the serial number can change (e.g. through a replacement logic board), and because of this serial numbers are only used by Apple as one way of identifying/tracking computers for Warranty purposes (e.g. relating to Apple Care, recall programs, etc).\nThis being the case, it's not clear what isn't working on your Mac Pro in terms of your account. If you could clarify, perhaps the community may be able to address what isn't working in a different way? Please don't take this as me being dismissive - I am merely trying to find a way forward for me or someone else to help you. \nMissing serial numbers\nI have seen a number of cases where users thought that a missing serial number was the cause of problems (such as the Messages app being unable to connect) but the real issue was something else. Evenso, in these cases the scenario was a missing serial number not an invalid one. (I should add that I have personally seen Macs with missing serial numbers function normally in all respects.)\nValid serial numbers\nIn the previously mentioned Tech note, Apple also states Developers should not make any assumptions about the format of the serial number such as its length or what characters it may contain.\nThis being the case, I'm not sure how you could generate a valid serial number for your Mac Pro. \nIf, on the other hand, your serial number was missing altogether, there is a tool that allows you to re-enter a serial number, but this tool only works if no serial number is present - it doesn't allow you to edit an existing record, which you do have.\nProving your hypothesis\nBy the way, if you are correct about what is going on in your case, the only way you will prove it to Apple is to take these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*use your Apple ID on your Mac Pro and demonstrate what isn't working\n\n*use your Apple ID on another Mac Pro of the same model/configuration and show that everything is working fine\n\n*swap the logic boards between the two\n\n*use each computer in turn\n\n*if everything works fine on your machine with the other logic board, and no longer works fine on the other machine with your logic board, you've proven your case\n\n", "Q: \"System\" storage on macOS Sierra is 470GB!

Can I do anything to fix it?\n\nA: Old question but since I had 5 minutes ago the same problem, I'll post my solution:\nThe audio output is as Graham Min describes a double output, working for headphone jack or Toslink adaptor.\nIn my case the problem appeared as I disconnected my headphones: OSX didn't switch to integrated output but stayed on digital (optical) output\nThis page describes an elegant non invasive solution and in my case the solution was as simple as connecting the headphones again, and diconnecting them gently.\nHere the steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your headphones back in.\n\n*Play a bit of sound through them (e.g., a song), then stop the sound.\n\n*Make sure Preferences is quit.\n\n*Launch Preferences and open the Sound pane.\n\n*While the Sound pane is open and set to Headphones, pull out the headphone plug from the jack.\n\n*It will reset itself to \"Internal Speakers\" and you are good to go.\n\nA: You should be able to restore normal audio by selecting Internal Speakers or Line Out in the System Preferences > Sound panel.\nThe light is because the headphone jack is also a TOSLINK port:\n\nTOSLINK (from Toshiba Link) is a standardized optical fiber connector system. Also known generically as an \"optical audio cable\" or just \"optical cable\", its most common use is in consumer audio equipment (via a \"digital optical\" socket)\n\n\n\nA: I'm going to quote: https://superuser.com/a/37804\nPersonally, I've had success gently using a toothpick to nudge the stuck pins.\nSee also: https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/59477/My+headphone+jack+glows+with+a+red+light\n\nmacRumors ref: No sound out of MacBook speakers & red LED in\n  Headphone jack.   The red light is probably because its a\n  Mini-TOSLINK port.\n\nThere is a metal prong in the jack and sometimes it can be bent,   causing the digital audio to be turned on when it shouldn't be.\n\n.\n\nThe problem is there is a switch in the jack that tells it if you have a mini headphone plug or an optical plug plugged into the\n    headphone port. The problem is when you remove the plug, the jack\n    doesn't know it and keeps shining the red light to talk with the\n    optical. This disables the internal speakers and you see digital out\n    instead of internal speakers in the speaker conrtol panel. Plugging\n    and unplugging the speakers may get it working right for awhile but it\n    won't last forever.\n\nAnd, for the brave hearted,\n\nI slid a paperclip in, and pushed out a little metal on the side.   That did the job, and I have internal sound again. And the\n    digital red light, is now off.\n\n\n\nA: I struggled for a long period of time trying to find an answer. Tried blowing in headphone jack but with my mouth not touching it, deleting audio files, updating OS, doing a toothpick trick.. almost gave up, but than I found this neat advice.

I checked in \"devices\" but only see my iPhone, iPad and my Windows laptop (where I have also signed into iCloud) .\nWhat can I do to ensure my account isn't compromised?\n\nJust found an email from Apple with the details:\n\n\nA: Log into www.appleid.apple.com and from here you will see all the devices currently logged into your Apple ID, you can also delete devices that you don't recognise. \nHere's what it looks like from my account. \n\n", "Q: Why max inode count became 2^32-1 on my hdd after update to OS X 10.12 Sierra After upgrade from OS X 10.10 Yosemite to 10.12 Sierra i noticed that % of used inodes became 0% instead of 99%.\n\nAs far as i understand max number of inodes became 2^32-1 but i can't google anything about it. \nIs there any information from Apple? I tried to contact apple support but no luck.\n\nA: You do not detail which file system you're using, so I'm assuming you're using the default HFS+ file system on Sierra.\nThe HFS+ file system does not have an \"inodes\" concept similar to other file systems. Therefore the inodes free/used counts really do not make sense for HFS+, and never have.\nIn order to comply with standards the df command on macOS do report inode information. However it is just made up figures more or less.\nOn older version of macOS the df command consistently reported that you were using approx. the same ratio of inodes as the ratio between free and used space. So if you were using 500 GB out of a 1 TB drive, it would report that you've used about 50% of your inodes. \nOn Sierra Apple must have decided that it was better to just report 0% usage. Either number is okay as it is entirely bogus anyhow.\nIn the underlying file system on disk, nothing have changes in regards to the maximum number of files you can save. It was (2^32)-1 before, and it is still (2^32)-1 now.\n", "Q: editing quoted text in Gmail iOS app The new Gmail iOS app (version 5.0.4) no longer allows me to edit quoted text in reply and forwarded messages. This is a serious limitation.\nIs there a fix or a workaround, short of copying the entire quoted text, pasting it into Notes, editing it, and pasting the result back in Gmail?\n(Despite the new look, version 5 seems to be a step in the wrong direction. The previous version worked just fine.)\n\nA: This seems to have been fixed in version 5.0.7.\n", "Q: Apple Mail not downloading attachments I am using macOS Sierra. Recently, the Mail app started having problems with attachments. On many (but not all) messages, attachments show up, but they are displayed as \"Mail Attachment\", not as the actual file name. Curiously, sometimes the correct icon shows up. I thought that maybe they needed some time to download, but waiting for hours does not solve it. I tried turning on and off the automatic attachment download and deleting the Mail Downloads directory, but that did not fix it.\nThis is an Exchange account, which may be part of the problem.\nAny idea what could be causing this?\n\nA: I found this post to be very interesting: \nhttp://osxdaily.com/2016/12/17/fix-mail-not-showing-attachments-mac/\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your computer \n\n*Rebuild your email mailbox(es) (this may take a long time to run, be sure your connected to internet because it's going to reload all the mails) \n\n*In your \"Account Information\", select Download Attachement that matters to you (all)\n\n*Restart Mail.\n\n\nHope that helps\n\nA: I have been battling this problem for months and after an odd work around from Apple that only worked some of the time I found my problem. Within the \"Mail app\" in preferences you can add a rule to direct emails into specific folders. I accidentally found out that the reason the downloads would not complete was that I had made rules to transfer the email and that transfer would happen before the download was complete. I went into mail rules and stopped all the transfers and now the emails attachments completely download no problems.\n\nA: Disabling \"enable junk mail filtering\" fixed it for me (Mail Preferences). I tried everything, this fixed it as a last ditch attempt before only using my phone as the goto device.\n", "Q: How to remove iPhone music from Amazon Music app?

I enabled this once and music from my iPhone added to the Amazon Music. However now I turned it off but the device music still in the Amazon Music app, how can I remove these songs without going to each one individually and remove it?\n\nA: Unfortunately after contacting Amazon, it looks like the only way is to remove the Amazon music app and reinstall it again and download the songs that were downloaded before!\n\nA: Answer valid as of 10-12-17:\nGo to \"My Music\" and in the upper right hand corner of the screen, you will see the thre lttle dots that mean more optons.

I had other recent keyboard problems that I posted about here on this MacBook, and followed these instructions to no avail.\nI have tried removing everything I found related to my uninstalled copies of Karabiner, Karabiner Elements, and Logitech software like the Logitech Control Center.\n\nA: I finally figured out that there was a kernel extension named org.pqrs.driver.VirtualHIDManager from an old Karabiner installation that was running and causing this problem. It was in my boot volume at /Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-Elements/org.pqrs.driver.VirtualHIDManager.kext/.

I have a MacBook Air and just updated to macOS Sierra, which automatically installed the \"Photos\" app to replace my old \"iPhotos\" app. As I scrolled through the \"Photos\" app sidebar I checked to see that all of my photos were there in the \"Photos\" folder (at the top of the sidebar). Then I scrolled down to the \"Recently deleted\" folder and to my horror saw a huge number of my images shown under the advisory that these photos would be permanently deleted in 28 days! They are  photos that I didn't delete from iPhotos or Photos, and I don't want them deleted.\nI looked again at the \"Photos\" folder and saw that those same photos — the ones destined for deletion in 28 days — were also showing up in the \"Photos\" folders. I don't need two copies of them but I am wondering if they are safe if I see them in the \"Photos\" folder?\nNow I did keep copies of my images both in my old iPhotos app and in another photo app (called My Pictures), and I did recently delete a large number of them from my \"My Pictures\" file to get more disk space, but I didn't delete the duplicates of those same photos from my iPhoto files. Is it possible that the photos I now see as listed for deletion (under Recently Deleted) are those duplicate photos I deleted from my My Pictures folder?  \n\nA: When you \"delete\" an image in Photos, what really happens is that the photo gets moved to the Recently Deleted folder, and only after 30 days is it then actually deleted. Photos in the Recently Deleted folder do not show up in other areas of the Photos app, so if the only images there are also showing up in the \"Photos\" section, they must be duplicates that you deleted.\nIf you want to delete photos now, you can either click \"Delete All\" in the top right corner, or select the photos you want to delete and the button will change to \"Delete\" and only remove those that you selected.\nIf there are photos there that are not duplicates that you want to delete, you can select those and click \"Recover\" in the top right, and they will be moved to \"Photos\".\n\nA: I have no idea what is going on with your copies of copies and deleted copies and so on. That is why apps that take away file handling from the user can become a nightmare if it gets into an unexpected state.\nWhat I recommend you do is save your images out of the Photos database to somewhere safe so you can let its do its thing with no worries:\nGo to the Pictures folder in your User folder. Right (or Control) click the \"Photos Library.photoslibrary\" file and choose \"Show Package Contents...\" You will see a folder named \"Masters\" which holds all the image files (AFAIK.) \nCopy this folder somewhere safe. This will backup all the photos in the database (put it on an external drive and disconnect it if you want to be absolutlely sure.) Then the app can do whatever it wants, like delete everything, and you will not lose any images.\n", "Q: How to keep MacBook awake with lid closed + extended display?

I understand this phenomenon happens because of the \"closed-clamshell\" mode, however what I want to achieve is to be able to close my MacBook Pro's lid and see the extended display on the wall - when I open the lid, I should be able to see the usual display on my laptop and still the extended one on the wall.\nUsed the latest versions of both NoSleep & Caffeine (also tried InsomniaX), but no luck.\n\nA: Requirements for closed-display mode from, Use your Mac notebook computer in closed-display mode with an external display:\n\nTo use closed-display mode with your Mac notebook, you need:  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*An AC power adapter \n  \n*An external keyboard and mouse or trackpad, either USB or wireless  \n  \n*A USB-C to USB adapter if you're using a USB mouse or keyboard with MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015) and later or MacBook Pro models introduced in late 2016\n  \n*An external display or projector\n  \n  \n  If you're using a USB keyboard and mouse\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure that your Mac notebook is plugged in to an outlet using the AC power adapter.\n  \n*Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to your Mac.\n  \n*With your Mac turned on and the display open, connect the Mac to the appropriate port on the external display or projector and turn the display or projector on. \n  \n*Use an appropriate Apple video adapter if necessary.\n  \n*After your Mac notebook's Desktop appears on the external display, close the computer's lid.\n  When you close the lid: \n  In OS X Lion v10.7 and later, the external display changes to a blue screen, then shows your Desktop.\n  In OS X v10.6.8 and earlier, you can wake your Mac by clicking the mouse button or pressing a key on the external keyboard.\n  \n\nYou can now use your Mac notebook as you normally would with a USB keyboard and mouse.\n", "Q: Upgrading MacBook air from 10.6.8 to Sierra I have been given a MacBook air by a friend that needs it repaired.

This means it's actually two separate devices that just share the same footprint.  So, it is entirely conceivable that the printer drivers are readily available from Apple while the scanner driver isn't.\nHeading over to their Support Page, it appears that they have both printer AND scanner drivers for macOS (Sierra) so you would need to install that driver for your scanner to work.\n\n", "Q: 2 HDMI 1080p monitors from 1 usb c port I have the 15 inch MacBook Pro 2016, is there a way to plug in 2 hdmi displays into 1 port. \n\nA: Technically this is possible. The trick, however, is finding the adaptor you will need to achieve it. I've seen many USB-C to HDMI adaptors on the market, but I don't recall seeing a USB-C to dual HDMI adaptor.\nOn the other hand, some people have achieved connecting two displays to a single USB-C port using a couple of different connectors. By this I mean they have purchased a USB-C to multiple port adaptor and then connected one HDMI display to the HDMI port, and a second HDMI display to one of the other ports through a second adaptor cable. I've generally seen this done in one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a DVI to HDMI adaptor, with the DVI end connected to the DVI port on the USB-C to multiple port adaptor and the HDMI end into the display\n\n*Using a USB to Video adaptor, with the USB end connected to the USB port on the USB-C to multiple port adaptor and the DVI end into the display\n\n\nHowever, your mileage in doing so may vary. I would ensure that if you go down this path that you're purchasing your adaptors/cables from somewhere you can return them if they don't do the job. Of course, if you can find a USB-C to Dual HDMI port adaptor, that should make things a lot easier.\nEDIT\nAnother option may be using a USB-C hub (or the like) that has additional USB-C ports and then using two USB-C to HDMI adaptors plugged into those. \nHowever, you will need to ensure that any such USB-C ports are not limited to only data transfer, charging, etc and that they will support output to a display. This is also true if you opt for a USB to Video adaptor.\n\nA: You can buy a USB Type-C to HDMI and a HDMI doubler, overall you can get these two for around $10.\nI found these two to reccomend for you:\nDoubler\nCoverter\nIt would best to double check your options though.\n", "Q: \"The installation failed.

Used to be, I bought music in iTunes and then sync'ed it to my phone. If I didn't have enough space on the phone, I'd only sync certain playlists. Then I always had the music on my phone, even if in airplane mode or off wifi. Now I do that but it doesn't sync all the music. Apparently I have to go to each playlist on my phone and click 'make available off line'. This is tedious as I have numerous playlists. (But it is not all my music that is in iTunes, because I don't have the space on the phone.) So if I must do both, I must consult the list of playlists that have been sync'd, open each one on the iPhone and click 'make available offline'.\nI am often not on Wi-Fi, for instance if I'm driving or taking a walk or on an airplane. Why should most of my music cease to be available? This is music I purchased. Why is there an implicit assumption that we are always on Wi-Fi?\nQuestion 1: What is the point of having both 'sync' and 'make available offline'?\nQuestion 2: Is there any way to just use 'sync' and have the music behave as before the advent of iCloud, ie. be available on my phone regardless of whether I have Wi-Fi?\n\nA: I hope you only use iTunes purchases not Apple music.\nSo the answer for your first problem is,\nthat If you sync them, they will be available on all of your devices. However, making them available offline means that you can listen to your music wherever you go. You do not have to be connected to WiFi. So sync only add them to your Music app automatically. Point is that some people don't have enough space to download every song since their library is like 20GB. So they use Wi-Fi to download their song when they needed.\nAnswer for second question :\nSo as far as I know , they now use iCloud to sync all of your music to your every device through iCloud. So whenever you purchase some music it will automatically being available on your iPhone. Then you have select download if you wanna listen offline.\nIf you like to make them automatically download to your phone without touching download for every single song, just goto Settings -> Music -> Under downloads turn on \"Automatic Downloads\" . That would automatically download your songs.\nSince you have DRM enabled songs on your device ( Purchased from Apple) you cannot simply do whatever you want. If you want to play with them as before they use iCloud, you have to manually download that song from internet and add them to iTunes. Then sync to your iPhone. Otherwise as Apple Supportive person told me there will be no option because, you run out of space.\nIf you don't like to manually do what I said, you have to do keep itunes purchases only synced. But that will not solve your problem. If this ain't clear enough just add a comment. Thanks.\n\nA: To answer question 1: I assume part of the reason for this is that 'sync' can be used to put music on your phone from iTunes that was not purchased through iTunes. I have a lot of music from CDs, some of which are not available in iTunes, that I can put on my phone this way. \nTo answer question 2: This works for me...what versions of iOS and iTunes are you using? Before telling it to 'sync,' did you select specific music?\n", "Q: How to package a command line software to an Application I have a command line executable (written in C) with some related resources, and I would like to package it as an application (inside the .app folder).

But it was for no avail, the problem persists.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue. 2015 MacBook Pro 13\", AppleCare. \nIt took three attempts for the Apple service agent to resolve the issue, over the space of one month. \nThe first time, they replaced the main logic board. \nThe second time, they replaced the whole top case, including trackpad and battery. \nIt was only after I found this post and brought it to their attention (including the fact that the SD card reader was showing as a fault when I ran system diagnostics) that on the third attempt they replaced the I/O board which contains the SD card reader and thankfully it worked. \n\nA: The Problem could be connected to Filevault as well:\nhttps://www.apfeltalk.de/community/threads/macos-10-12-sierra-vs-filevault-massive-probleme.506301/\nShort translation: AppleCare replicates the error and says its fine anyway. Disabling Filevault: Startup works; enabling again: nothing works.\nAnother one:\nmacOS Sierra slow to accept password at login\nProblem disappeared after 6 weeks, someone proposes to disable filevault then 'fix permissions'\nI am studying the startup-logs right now. \nDo you keep an SD-Card in the Slot while rebooting (cause i do :)\n\nA: Sorry to bring it to you this way, but it is a Hardware error and it is very hard to prove it to Apple Care at this moment because as you said, laptop APPEARS to work fine if you disable FileVault.\nI've had this problem since December 2016 on my 3 month old Macbook Pro 13inch Early 2015.\nGuys, this issue is nothing to do with FileVault. FileVault just expose this problem to you.\nProblem is \"EVERYTHING\" before OS load up is slow. you can try it. Hold Alt to go to boot device selector while booting, you will see it is slow. Hold D when Macbook is turning on, you will see Diagnosis page is also slow (my Diagnosis page sometimes pass 100%, sometimes show SD Card error code).\nReason you see FileVault is slow, is because this login page is a pre-boot screen. It ask you for password before it can unlock your hard disk. once password is entered, Real boot process start and OS load up. It is a fake screen that look like a real OS, but it is just a pre-boot screen.\nI am not sure why it is fast inside of OS, but before OS loads up, it is painfully slow with keyboard and mouse lagging.\nIf you disable FileVault, after waiting long for your slow pre-boot laptop to show apple logo, it directly access the real OS, and since in real OS, issue goes away, you will see that boot is fast again. but in reality, you just skipped filevault boot login screen and went directly to OS. nothing is actually faster.\nI had sent my Macbook to repair on 26 December, got it back on 3rd Jan. They did a SMC reset, NVRAM reset and a full OS clean install and they told me my Macbook Pro is flawless!\nIssue went away temporarily but returned back as soon as I used SD Card slot. I am not sure if your issue is also related to SD Card slot usage, but it could indicate some hardware parts inside your Macbook is faulty.\nSince now I figure out it is returning back when I use a SD Card, I returned it back to repair again this Monday and told them to try putting an SD Card. Now they find out there is a hardware error and they are fixing the parts. I shall receive my Macbook back next week and I will update here on what they did change and If issue went away.\nIssue will be back if I put an SD card inside and then take it out. I need to do NVRAM reset to make my macbook forget about SD Card to make it fast again. it is crazy!\n\nA: It seems that upgrading to macOS 10.12.4 solved the issue, although I found no mention of it on the update information.\n\nA: 5 years later, I could solve my very similar problem (Boot login screen responsive only a second every minute) by using the Apple Disk Utility to run the First Aid on the (encrypted) SD card.\n", "Q: When I log into App Store on my iMac I get a notification on my iPhone saying someone's trying to log in. But the location is wrong So I want to buy something on the App Store on my iMac. \nI logged in and I instantly got a notification on my iPhone saying that there's an iMac trying to log into my Account (I don't know why. That's the first time since forever). However, the location is wrong. It says that the iMac is about 200km away from my actual position (which is wrong).\nI'm afraid that someone kind of bypassed my login? Is that possible? Or is it just a bug that it's showing the wrong location?\n\nA: As your question states, you received the notification on your iPhone instantly after logging into your account via your iMac. Since you know you just logged in, and then instantly got the notification, the chances this was just a coincidence and someone bypassed your login at the same time, is extremely unlikely. \nMuch more likely is that the location data was off. There are many factors that can be used to determine someone's location and the accuracy of location data can be affected by all of these.\nFor example, if your iMac is connecting through a VPN then the location it displays may be totally different to where it actually is, even to the extent it appears to be in another country/continent/hemisphere. This is only one example, as I'm sure you would know if you are connecting via a VPN.\nOther factors affecting location include WiFi networks (SSIDs in particular), the method of your internet connection, IP addresses, core location constants, and the list goes on. \nSometimes, depending on the configuration of your router, the DNS servers being used can change and this too can affect accuracy. \nSo, in a nutshell, you need not worry. However, it is good practice to regularly change your account password, so perhaps this is a good reminder to do just that! :)\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Early 2015 13\" temperature Last week I bought new MacBook Pro 13\", early 2015, core i5, 8GB RAM, and now I am a little bit worried about it's temperature. It's my first MacBook, so I don't really know what temperatures should I expect.\nI am getting 50°C - 60°C (CPU) when browsing the web, while having multiple tabs opened (Google Chrome) and Dropbox running in the background.\nI don't know if these are okay, the bottom side of MacBook seems a little warm on touch.\nMaybe I am a little bit overcautious, but I just want to make sure.\n\nA: This is absolutely 100% perfectly fine!\nMy MBP temp is regularly between 66 and 81 degrees, and my fans are regularly at 6200 RPM when my CPU usage is high. \nAlso, this resource (which can be filtered) clearly shows that 50°C - 60°C is nothing to worry about.\n\nA: Personally, I was getting the same temps. Normal, I think, but I was unhappy with them so I replaced the thermal compound that had dried up with Arctic Silver and now it idles around 40 c and 46 c while tasked with pretty much everything until I open up a game, or the Adobe Suite and start doing work. Final Cut also puts the temperature up. Sometimes it hits 50.

Could this be a potential battery thief?\n*Edit: This thread was put on hold (because of too little info.), so I add a complimentary question here to mike's answer below...\nAre you saying that the \"iDevices\" are making broadcasts the very same way for not hidden networks as for a hidden ones? In that case, what content is broadcasted for those networks that are not hidden? \n*Edit2: Please see discussion below.

I'm trying to figure out how to be notified that multiple stages have been reached in a series of piped commands.\nFor the sake of discussion, lets say I have a command like so that any part of it could take a long time. I want to be notified when each \"stage\" has completed by having the script say something.\nnetstat -a | stage_complete.sh \"netstat\" | grep -v WAIT | stage_complete.sh \"grep done\"\n\nwhere stage_complete.sh is a simple bash script to say the argument text, and pass stdin to stdout.\nstage_complete.sh\nOUT=$*\nsay \"$OUT\"\ncat /dev/stdin\n\nThis idea works fine - except that say doesn't \"wait\" for the word to complete - it just starts to say the phrase, and then immediately continues on, so if my commands run quickly, then it says \"netstat\" and \"grep done\" at the same time, overlapping each other.\nHow can i make say wait? or have it queue up text, and only say it once the previous text has completed? Note that I've noticed that commands like so wait for each other to complete:\nsay one && say two && say three\nbut can't see how to make that work in my pipes!\n\nA: Turns out all I had to do was consume all of stdin at the start of my script... I don't want it to process stdin as it's received, but when the entire previous command in the pipe chain completes.\nSo my stage_complete.sh script is simply this, which works for my use case!\nstage_complete.sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nOUT=$(cat -)\n\nMSG=\"$*\"\nsay \"$MSG\"\n\necho \"$OUT\"\n\nNote: I figured this out by asking the question in another stack exchange (unix), over here\n", "Q: Compiling with clang in the terminal is extremely slow after seeing a message that my disk is almost full. How to restore performance? I removed files so I now have 18.7GB storage free after receiving the finder message that my storage is almost full.\nStill, compiling is extremely slow. I’m wondering if there some setting that I missed.\nHow can I remedy this? \n\nA: If you are on a spinning hard disk and you remove a large amount of files, you might have sub-optimal allocation of some files. If you have an SSD, you’ll need to profile the build process to determine the actual bottleneck.\nJust to confirm, the df -g command lists 18.7 GB free for the OS volume? Assuming yes, you’ve missed no settings like cleaning up local snapshots in time machine or emptying the trash.\n\nFor the HDD situation, you can test that by shutting down the Mac after removing the source files or copying them to another drive.\nAfter the restart, you might run for a day (set the Mac to never sleep) and the hot file optimization will start to move files that aren't accessed often off of the fastest portion of the hard drive.\nThen - move your source code back and try a compile. At that point if you are still slow, you'll need to get into specifics - use the time command to time the compiles and then profile the system with vm_stat 5 or similar like Activity Monitor to see if you are constrained by RAM or by CPU or by IO. iostat also will be very helpful for measuring the iops and read/write aggregate transfer rates so you know how your storage is being accessed moment by moment while clang does it’s work.\nThe above steps on my machine show that io and storage has a very low impact on the compiler and instead CPU and threading the build would be how to speed it up but my code base is probably far different than yours.\n", "Q: What's the difference between `brew tap caskroom/cask` and `brew install brew-cask`?

If you go to Settings → Trackpad and disable the smart zoom, does the delay go away or noticeably shorten?\n", "Q: Is it possible to set touch bar in F1-F12 mode for a specific app?

I'm also a big fan of iTunes Match and Apple Music despite having tens of thousands of CD and phonograph recordings digitized. \n\nA: Another perspective, from someone who's had iCloud since it was .mac\nWe have 2 Macs, 2 iPhones & an iPad, shared across 2 IDs [myself & my partner]\nWe set up Family Sharing  to cross-pollinate all our purchases, music, books, apps.\nWe share certain portions of our calendar with each other.\nContacts are not shared between IDs - that you would have to do manually.\nComputers all use Time Machine plus Backblaze. iDevices are backed to iCloud every night, & to iTunes before any iOS update.\nPhotos are all kept locally, not in the cloud (I don't grok that bit either ;)\nMusic is all kept locally, no Match or Apple Music etc.\nThat also means no extra subscription charges for iCloud storage etc.\nBeen perfectly happy this way for years.\nBenefits:-\nSynced calendars to all devices [inc the shard parts to each separate ID]\nSimple things like looking somewhere up on the map, then immediately having that data in the phone, on the go.\nBookmarks & passwords synced, so I don't have to remember them all.\nIt's all completely free, so long as you stay under your 5GB storage limit, which is easy without photos & music.\nSo, you can go halfway & still get some benefit.\n\nA: As someone who used iCloud at first, but now uses Dropbox, I say go Dropbox or another third party file sync platform for files (i.e. photos, docs, videos, etc). I still use iCloud (free 5GB) for syncing contacts, calendar, and Apple device settings.\nThe main reason is an old saying, \"Don't put all your eggs in one basket\". It's been much easier to share files (especially photos) with non-Apple friends and family. And my wife had an issue where she thought when you deleted a photo/video from your phone that it stayed on iCloud...it didn't and we lost a lot of photos that way. Not blaming iCloud per se, but just not a function.\nA third party can also make it a lot easier to transition your data if you ever decide to leave Apple's garden and go play somewhere else. \n", "Q: What is needed to mirror both an iPad and a late-2016 MacBook Pro to an HDTV (non-concurrently)? I want to be able to mirror an iPad Air and a late-2016 MacBook Pro to an HDTV. Not simultaneously, just one at a time. I know I could just get both the lightning to digital av adapter and the usb-c (thunderbolt 3) to digital av adapter, but is there a way to do it where I wouldnt need both? Like maybe a female usb-c to male lightning adapter (but it would need to be able to pass both video and audio).\nIf it helps reduce the amount of stuff I'd need to purchase, I already have HDMI to HDMI, HDMI to mini HDMI, and HDMI to mini DP (thunderbolt 2).\n\nA: Do you happen to have an Apple TV?\nIf so, that would be how I'd do it, using Airplay.\nIf not, then any Apple TV (2nd generation and above) supports Airplay and you already have the cable (i.e. HDMI to HDMI) that you need to connect it to your HDTV.\nThe advantage of this is that you also get all the benefits of having the Apple TV as well, not to mention the fact you won't have your iPad or MBP tethered with a cable (or cables) to your HDTV (i.e. the mirroring happens via WiFi and you're able to have the iPad or MBP anywhere you want while mirroring).\nIf your question is about connecting these devices to any HDTV that you may need to connect to (i.e. not a single one at your home, but to various models in various locations) or you do not want/need an Apple TV, then I'm not aware of a single solution that will pass both video and audio from both devices, but perhaps someone else will have a solution.\n[EDIT]\nJust checked and Apple are selling refurbished 3rd generation Apple TVs for $59. At that price, it'd be hard to warrant spending the money on cables and/or adaptors, unless you intend to carry them with you in your travels.\nYou can also buy brand new Apple TV 3 units from places like Target who still have them in stock (since they've been superseded).\n", "Q: Can the Early 2016 MacBook (not Pro) Drive Two Thunderbolt Displays? This question is NOT about how to connect two Thunderbolt displays — there are plenty of questions asked here about that, but whether or not the graphics chip in the Early 2016 MacBook 1.3 GHz Core m7 (M7-6Y75) has the power to drive two external displays (Apple Thunderbolt Display) at 2560 x 1440 resolution?\nHere's the backstory. I have a MacBook Pro connected to two Thunderbolt displays. I am considering replacing it, but I love my dual Thunderbolt displays. I would like to replace it with the newest 2016 MacBook, but concerned it won't have enough power to drive the two displays.\n\nA: I should have looked closer to the tech specs on the Apple website:\n\nDual display and video mirroring: simultaneously supports full native\n  resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels at\n  30Hz on an external display, both at millions of colors.\n\nBased on this I can only run my built-in display and one external display, and only at 30Hz. \n\nA: What those specs are saying is that this model can simultaneously support the internal display as well as up to 3840x2160 at 30 Hz on an external display, both at \"millions of colours.\"\nIn other words, connecting two external Thunderbolt Displays is not officially supported by Apple. The two displays are the internal display and an external display.\n", "Q: Remove duplicate menu bar icons in macOS Sierra When I upgraded to macOS Sierra, a lot of my menu bar icons were duplicated.

When I quit Team Viewer my audio is back at normal. \nDoes anyone know what the problem is? \nEdit\nI created a video which will explain the problem:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaiYha6XNno\n\nA: TeamViewer only ducks the audio device you selected.

I use a RØDE NT-USB external microphone as my sound card. I selected Built-In Line Out/In as my audio device. Now TeamViewer has no idea what to do. :)\nIt's an ugly hack but victor's solution didn't work for me.\n\nA: This sounds like the audio ducking feature, commonly used by video chatting applications to temporarily lower the volume of other sounds.\nTo turn it off, go to Applications/Utilities/VoiceOver Utility.app > Sound\nUncheck \"Enable audio ducking\".\n", "Q: Is it possible to quit TextEdit by clicking the red x of the last open file (w/o add'l software)? If you open TextEdit and then click on the red x in the top bar of the document, TextEdit will remain open.

I haven't the slightest idea.\nI've found a piece of third-party software that offers this functionality called \"RedQuits.\"\nIs it possible for TextEdit to automatically quit itself when the x is pressed, without installing additional software?\n\nA: The document window's close button in TextEdit does just what it's supposed to do, it closes the document window. It's not there to close the application, that's what ⌘Q is for.\nSo, to answer your question, no you cannot quit TextEdit by clicking the close button of a document window by itself, you'd need to use a third party app to add that functionality.\n", "Q: How to turnoff screen / lock Macbook Pro with touch bar using keyboard? This was working on older Mac using CtrlShiftPower. But this doesn't work on the new Macbook Pro 2016 with touch bar. Can someone please help.

Launch the bootcamp application on the Mac and deselect disinstall windows 10 or lower versions. Then select the \"Get latest drivers from Apple\" and insert a USB driver inside the computer. \n\nMake sure that the USB is working well and formatted on FAT32. \nIf you're experiencing issues try to format using SDFormatter that is free. Press the continue button and let it download the latest drivers. \n\nKeep the USB inserted and boot on Windows10. In normal conditions, Windows should recognize the driver data and launch it automatically but if it doesn't recognize, just launch it like another program on your computer via the USB drive.\nAfter doing this process reboot your computer and the latest Mac drivers including the CD reader, keyboard, SD reader and many more hardware will work.\nMethod 2\nMake sure that your keyboard is recognized by Windows10. Check your hardwares inserted/paired with the computer you're using through the control panel.

A few days ago, I decided to move nearly 80,000 messages from an IMAP server to a Gmail server using Mail.app on Sierra 10.12.1:\nThis task still hasn't completed.\n\"Checking for Mail…\" comes and goes as one might expect, and normal mail functionality seems to work fine. Connection Doctor shows nothing strange. \nHowever, this task has been going on for days, and moves very slowly—I've left the computer on all night and it only chews through a few thousand, occasionally stopping with an error. If I restart Mail.app (it takes a bit to quit), it eventually comes back up with the same 79,718 messages needing to be moved.\nIs there any way to terminate this process? I'm inclined to try another tool at this point, but I'd like Mail.app to stop trying to move these messages.\n\nA: Two things which come to mind that you could try are:\n\n\n*\n\n*pressing the Command + . keys\n\n*pressing the  ESC key \n\n\nEither way you may need to do this a few times and wait for the task to register what you're doing.\n\nA: Delete the account that you were moving mail to and it will cancel the move. \n\nA: The problem is likely Gmail. It's not well known, but Gmail throttles paid and free accounts once they move a certain amt of mail in the day.  The last time I checked, it was 500 MB of mail -- and then you were throttled for 24 hours.\nMaybe things have changed -- but this has been my experience in the past.  Want to test it?  Disable the Gmail account, and see if the other accounts download more quickly.\n\nA: For me, quitting Mail seemed to cancel the stuck move.\nAttempting to move the same messages again seems to get stuck once more but I'm guessing it's just taking a long time because there are several thousand.\n\nA: I have a similar problem having accidentally moved / copied an archive folder of ~65,000 mails to a public folder on my employers mail server ...\nAfter having spent all day copying mails, it is now in a near-endless loop showing a server error message for each further mail that it cannot be copied because the \"quota\" is exceeded.\nForce-quitting and restarting Mail (with/without SHIFT key held) does not help as the process simply starts from the beginning again after a few seconds.\nRestarting the computer does not help.\nDeactivating Mail-Sync for that account does not help.\nThe side effect is that I am unable to use Apple Mail for ANY of the several accounts on the machine (MBP).\nMy only workaround is to use other clients / web-based mail clients\nThe only solution may be the suggested one to delete the mail account. :(\n", "Q: I was able to erase FileVault encrypted drive My Mac mini was running Sierra. It had FileVault enabled. I read that you shouldn't be able to erase a FileVault encrypted drive. I logged into Recovery and I was able to erase the drive. \nThe next step I did was \"Restore\" and now I see a OSX Base System partition created. So, I thought heck, macOS would be installed and I restarted but I led me to Recovery Menu again, so I went to the reinstall macOS. But, when I select the hard drive, it shows the \"This disk is locked\". \nSo, I read that if you go to file menu in Disk Utility there should be an unlock option, but I don't see any.\nFurther in Disk Utility, it shows that the OS X Base System has consumed all the space.\nI obviously know the password, how do I recover from this?\n\nA: As you discovered, you can indeed erase a FileVault-encrypted disk even without the password.\nThe \"Unlock\" option is under the File menu when booted in Recovery.

All sessions will be closed.\" message - independent of the settings in preferences. I don´t tick the three options under \"General/Closing\" - all regarding the closing mechanism. Normally the message doesn't have to appear, does it?\nIt´s annoying that I cannot reboot my system without explicitly quitting iTerm2. If I don´t close is by myself the system will hang/block the shutdown.\n\nA: Under \"Preferences\" -> \"General\" -> \"Closing\" was a \"Confirm 'Quit iTerm2' command\" checkbox which worked for me. The \"Profiles\" -> \"Session\" -> \"Closing\" -> \"Do not prompt before closing\" option did not help with the shutdown case.\n\n\nA: Well, after upgrading to Sierra and installing latest version of iTerm2 I've got the hint from iTerm2 self: In \"Profiles\" there is an option into default profile (Tab \"session\") named \"Closing\" which was always \"on\" - after setting to \"Do not prompt before closing\" the behavior of iTerm2 is like expected.\n\n", "Q: Can I add \"16 pt\" option to font pulldown menus? Finder and all apps jump from 14pt to 18pt in dropdowns.  Can a 16pt be added?\n\nA: It's a flaky problem, or at least the solutions are flaky. As such, some apps, e.g. Mail, go through the motions but don't actually add the new size. Additionally, it may vanish at some undetermined time in the future. But for the present….\nFrom within the app (e.g. TextEdit) that you want to see 16 pts, pull up the font dialogue (Cmd-T). In the upper-left corner, you should see a dropdown button with a gear icon on it. Click that and near the bottom select 'Edit Sizes…'.\n\n\nIn the 'New Size' field, type '16' and then click the '+' button below it. Click done. Quit and re-launch the app.\n\nA: I add it all the time - like the size - but I can tell you, it never stays and hasn't for years and many OS iterations.\n", "Q: Triggering a video at startup like the \"Welcome Video\" on Mac OS X Snow Leopard Do you remember the incredible​ Welcome Video​ on Mac OS X Snow Leopard? Does anyone know how all this is achieved? I mean the principle of how to get the video to play automatically the first time one tries to log in to a New Mac. Any suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: I don't know how Apple did it, but a common solution to 'one-time only' actions is to check for the presence of a special hidden file in the user's home directory before doing them. \nSo in this case, you'd have a login script that checks if the file is there. If it is, do nothing. If it's not, play the video, then create the file.\n", "Q: IBooks on iPad: 2-page view for PDF for my studies I am very frequently using iBooks on my iPad, and for many PDF files it would be great to have them displayed, such that 2 pages are shown next to each other.\nIt is a very common thing for me to have to skip back and forth,  so that this would really help.\nI have allready seen a few questions akin to this one, however none exactly delivering what i need.\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I face the same problem and after some research, I figured out that apparently this feature only implemented in iBooks for ebooks and not for pdfs (also still in iOS11).

It doesn't actually move them. What can I do to fix this?\n\nA: To move a file to a different drive from the one it is on drag the file to the new location while holding down the Command key. The green '+' sign on the cursor should not be displayed.\nTo create an alias hold down Command-Option while dragging the file. A curved arrow icon will be added to the cursor to indicate an alias will be made.\n\nA: Short answer\nMost people just copy the files to the other drive and then remove them from the original drive. However, you can also use CommandC (or Edit Menu > Copy) to copy the file(s) and then paste them to your other drive using the OptionCommandV shortcut instead of the usual paste shortcut.\nLong answer\nSince you provided no detail on how you're trying to move the file, this answer assumes you're doing this via the standard Mac OS X El Capitan GUI.\nThe reason the file is being copied rather than moved is that you're moving it from one drive to another drive. Doing this implicitly means you're wanting to copy it rather than move it (this is how many people transfer documents and manually backup files). \nIf the files were moved by default, rather than copied, this would create a messy situation to try and keep track of. This also isn't what most people would expect, so the user experience would be shocking.\nImagine this: You spend a day working on a PowerPoint presentation and then want to put it onto a USB stick to take to a meeting. Would you expect the file to be moved or copied? If it's moved and you lose the USB stick, then what?\n", "Q: How do you install playground books on iPad? I found a playground book from Apple online called \"Talking To The Live View\". It's an updated playground from the 2016 WWDC. I want to install it on my iPad and try it out.

How can I wake up my MacBook pro with an iPhone, when the lid closed (no external display)?\nMacBook is not connected to power and there's a local wifi that it can connect to.\n\nA: macOS Sierra, has an option in Energy Saver > Power Adapter to \"Wake for Wi-Fi network access.\" In earlier versions that option was in Network preferences.\nApple Remote Access will wake a Mac this way but I am unaware of any iOS app that does this.\nGenerally speaking Wake On LAN (WOL) requires the sending device to send a so called \"Magic Packet\" and the receiving computer to be able to receive it and act upon it. I believe that Apple supports this method of WOL but I have not tested it in quite a while.\nSo your job will be to find an iOS app that provides WOL capability as it should do what you are looking for.\n", "Q: Dual (DVI) monitor setup for MacBook Pro 15\" (Retina mid-2015) I am looking for a solution to connect a MacBook Pro 11,4 (15\" retina model from mid 2015) to two monitors.

He switched to another computer and after doing a clean install (internet recovery) he then gave it to me. (Mavericks was installed then I installed Sierra).\nSo, here it is: he has an iPhone which he had previously paired to the Macbook, along with a magic mouse which he gave to me.\nTo my big surprise, the other day I saw that in the bluetooth icon has changed, and that his iPhone and the mouse (which I had not used yet) was already paired to the Macbook (mark as connected) without asking anything !\nI was even able to browse the files on his own phone...\nI'm starting to think I'm facing some serious security issue, or we missed something in the clean install procedure but I did not see anything like that on any site nor anyone talking about this ( except maybe this unsolved old thread explaining a similar problem but the devices were not connected for this one...)\nI just want to say that I already tried to:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the device from the bluetooth menu (holding Option key > [device name] > Delete but then it connected itself automatically some minutes later)\n\n*Shift + Option bluetooth menu > Debug > Reset bluetooth module (same result)\n\n*Cmd + Shift + P + R to reset NVRAM at boot (this seemed to work for several days, but then it connected automatically again today, still without asking anything!)\n\n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?\n\nA: Just to clarify, have you tried either of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the MacBook Pro go to System Preferences > Bluetooth and right-click on the device (his iPhone) and select Remove\n\n*On his iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth and tap on the 'info' icon on the right of your MacBook Pro  and then tap the Forget This Device option\n\n\nDoing this should solve your issue. For good measure, I would do both.\nIf the above steps don't work, try resetting the iPhone settings. Your co-worker can do this on his iPhone by going to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. However, make sure he has his passcode and Wi-Fi passwords handy.\nFinally, if you happen to not be using any Bluetooth devices with the MacBook, you can also turn it off totally from System Preferences > Bluetooth.\n", "Q: Recently added songs do not finish playing on my iPhone 6 Plus I just recently added several songs to my iPhone 6 Plus. Here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add songs to my playlist in iTunes in my MacBook Air.\n\n*Sync music to my iPhone 6 Plus\n\n\nProblem:\nWhen my phone is playing the recently added song, it does not finish. If the new song is 3 mins long, when it is somewhere on the middle, it will play the next track, but the display on my phone is still the same (the recently added song).\n\nA: I had that kind of problem too. When I asked about that from Apple Support their first solution was delete newly added songs and resync them to iPhone. If they are perfectly playing on iTunes, then obviously there was a syncing problem when adding songs to iPhone. Try what I suggested. Good luck.\n", "Q: does Macbook Pro continue refreshing screen when brightness is set to zero? In other words, does my Macbook's CPU realize it is wasting its time and energy by continuing to send instructions to a screen that has been completely darkened by setting the brightness to 0%?  (Not sure if this is equivalent to \"display sleep.\"  It may be.)\nI would hope so, but my guess is that it ignores the brightness setting and continues sending instructions just like it does when the screen is doing something useful with them.\nThe reason I ask is because I use my iPad as an external display (via Duet Display) and routinely dim my Macbook's screen whenever it's hooked up.\n\nA: Yes the screen keeps refreshing regardless of the brightness.\nIf you still have a mac with a glowing apple logo you can even see this,just dim the screen all the way and shine a light through the back of the apple logo, you can see the screen is still active in the light leaking through from the back.\nEdit: since I can sense the follow-up question allready:\nYou can achieve what you want using one of the ways described in this article:\nStop screen rendering on macbook\n", "Q: Where is the power button on the 2016 MBP With TouchBar? Where is the power button on the 2016 Macbook Pros w/ Touchbar?\n\nA: From the Apple Support Document, How to turn on or turn off your Mac:\n\nThe power button is adjacent to the Touch Bar and integrated with the Touch ID sensor. Press Touch ID (power button) to turn on (or off) your Mac.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2016 15\" w/ Touch Bar battery and overheating problems I bought my base model 15\" MacBook Pro w/ Touch Bar the day it was released, and I just received it yesterday. I've been copying and downloading all the data and files that I needed and the battery didn't last me more than 5 hours, if even 4. I have no idea what is wrong with it, but it's really overheating and I almost never hear the fan running, which also alerts me.\nToday I played Crossfire, a game with very basic graphics, on Windows 10 Bootcamp and it was ON FIRE! I had to close the game because of the laptop's temperature. Again, I did not hear the fan.\nThings I've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the System Management Controller (SMC)\n\n*Run hardware diagnostics by restarting and pressing the D key while booting. This was the first time I actually clearly heard the fan. The overall results were that it found no hardware problems.\n\n*I called Apple, but they had no idea what they were telling me as they were following a written script, although a Senior Advisor was talking to me regarding the issue.\n\n\nNow I have had it just for two days so far, and I have a two-week return period. Should I wait more and see how everything will work out, or should I return it?\nHas anyone experienced the same issue? Is there anything else for me to try?\n\nA: How did you reset the SMC? There are different processes depending on Mac model. Just to make sure, in your case the process is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAlso, do you actually know what the temperature is? If so, please add this to your question as it's a bit hard for the community to help/comment without knowing what it is. You can use software such as Monit, Fanny (an unfortunate name!) or iStat Menus to measure temperature and fan speed.\nRegardless, as a point of reference, this resource (which can be filtered) will give you an idea of the wide range of temperatures that Macs can work with. It may be a bit too early to include any data for your model, but there is a lot of data for MacBook Pro models listed. As an aside, my MBP temp is regularly between 66 and 81 degrees, and my fans are regularly at 6200 RPM when my CPU usage is high.\nAll that said, if I was in your shoes and confident that it's overheating and the fans aren't activating as they should, then I'd be making a Genius Bar appointment to have them test it. If a Genius Bar appointment isn't possible, and you have the option of returning it, then maybe that's what you should do and buy another one.\nFinally, in terms of your battery life, was the 4hr-5hr range just your initial range, or has it only lasted that long consistently? I ask because downloading and copying all the data you needed on your MBP is likely to be a much greater burden on your battery than normal everyday usage.\nFeel free to post back if you get any more info or have any other questions.\n\nA: A brand new computer should not give you such problems. I would return it within the two-week time window and ask for a full refund.\nSome people I work for need to buy new MacBook Pros, but it's hard to recommend them right now. For one person in particular, battery life is crucial. Everything I've heard so far about battery life, the new Apple MacBook Pros are lemons.\nIt's very disappointing, especially since it's been such a long time since these models were updated — people have been waiting for them. They're not selling these new machines any cheaper either, they ought to work at least as good as the previous generation!\nHopefully they'll come up with a revision that fixes the issues — meanwhile, if you can still get a full refund on your brand new MacBook, that's what I'd do.\n\nA: The problem you discribed is exactly the same that I have with my new MBP 15\" Touchbar (2,9Ghz, Radeon 460). \nThe reason why it's overheating is, that the fans do not automatically accelerate when there's a higher workload. They are continuously running at 2000 rpm. \nMy solution: Use iStat Menus\nThere you can manually increase the rpm to medium (3500-4000rpm) and high (4500+).\nYou will see, if you manually adjust the fans, the MBP will work great and there won't be any overheating issues.\nBUT that's not how a notebook should work. It must automatically adjust the fans.\nI talked to several apple support guys (In Germany) and they all told me, that they havent experienced such a thing yet. I did the same things like you, resetting NVRAM, resetting SMC and I even reinstalled the OS. Nothing helped.\nIt may be a firmware issue that will be fixed in the future. However it seems like just a minority of MBP Touchbar customers are facing this issue.\nMost likely I will exchange my notebook in January (since it's not available at the moment xD )\n\nA: My 15\" MBP w/ touchbar was overheating as well with as simple a task as streaming Netflix. I was roaming around the internet about temperature conditions and if cold weather could mess up my MBP as where I store it it could get very cold. I came across the setting of putting the \"hard disk to sleep when possible\" as a potentially damaging setting for my MBP in cold weather and I realized that maybe it had something to do with my computer overheating. I then unmarked the setting a lo and behold, I am now streaming Netflix without my laptop becoming hot. Try seeing if you have that setting on then turn it off and run your laptop, it could potentially help. \n\nA: I am having the exact same issue, & even after apple provided a replacement device to me today at 6pm this issue has not been resolved. \nBackstory: My original device was picked up 2 weeks ago, from the Pasadena store. Immediately that night I noticed that the heat was so bad the equipment was hot to touch, and even spreading to the sides and top other portions of the device. I reported it via online chat and immediately apple business contacted me the next day scheduling a Genius Bar appointment. During that appointment the genius tech wouldn't tell me what was wrong but stated after only a couple minutes that the device needed to be sent to engineering once it was returned for investigation, and they would provide a replacement no questions asked. The replacement device arrived tonight and 30 minutes into using it (Safari, Sublime text install, and web browsing on a solid surface it was so hot that it begin causing other issues( slowed keyboard response onscreen, screen flicker, lag). I contacted support again, and they immediately setup an appointment with Genius Bar for 6am tomorrow. I am really losing faith in this model but don't know what to do at this point because it appears that no one knows what the root cause of the issue is. Friends of mine have the same model without issues. If anyone has any details please share.\n", "Q: How to make selection from AppleScript dialog list with keystroke? I've created an application with AppleScript in Automator.\nThe application, right off the bat, presents the user with a dialog list.\nBy default, there are two ways to select an item from the list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using your mouse.\n\n*Using the arrow keys on your keyboard.\nHowever, what I would like to do is offer the user a third option: to select the item based on a keystroke or keyboard shortcut. I would also like the selected item to be submitted directly after the keystroke or keyboard shortcut is pressed.\nFor example:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    set FruitList to {\"Banana (#1)\", \"Kiwi (#2)\", \"Mango (#3)\", \"Coconut (#4)\", \"Pear (#5)\"}\n\n    set FavoriteFruitAnswer to choose from list FruitList with title \"Fruit Dialog\" with prompt \"What's your favorite fruit?\" default items \"Banana (#1)\"\n\n\n    if FavoriteFruitAnswer is false then\n        error number -128 (* user cancelled *)\n    else\n        set FavoriteFruitAnswer to FavoriteFruitAnswer's item 1 (* extract choice from list *)\n    end if\n\n    return input\nend run\n\nThe preceding code produces the following:\n\nWhat I want to occur is if the user presses the number \"2\" on their keyboard, therefore \"Kiwi (#2)\" is selected and then the \"OK\" button is automatically pressed. If the user presses the number \"4\" on their keyboard, therefore \"Coconut (#4)\" is selected and then the \"OK\" button is automatically pressed. And so on.\nIs this possible?\nWhat I know is possible is to create a dialog box with a text field where the user types in the number manually and then the user hits enter manually and the number is assigned to the corresponding fruit type.\nBut that's not a particularly pretty solution.\n\nA: AppleScript is not robust enough to do exactly what you're asking, however if you want to be able to select by number then put the number ahead of the name of the fruit, although enter will still need to be pressed after the number is pressed. Otherwise, pressing whatever the first character of the list item entry is will select it too. \nFor example, change the following two lines of code from:\nset FruitList to {\"Banana (#1)\", \"Kiwi (#2)\", \"Mango (#3)\", \"Coconut (#4)\", \"Pear (#5)\"}\nset FavoriteFruitAnswer to choose from list FruitList with title \"Fruit Dialog\" with prompt \"What's your favorite fruit?\" default items \"Banana (#1)\"\n\nTo:\nset FruitList to {\"1. Banana\", \"2. Kiwi\", \"3. Mango\", \"4. Coconut\", \"5. Pear\"}\nset FavoriteFruitAnswer to choose from list FruitList with title \"Fruit Dialog\" with prompt \"What's your favorite fruit?\" default items \"1. Banana\"\n\n\nAs a side note, double-clicking a list entry to select it with the mouse does also trigger the enter key press automatically.\n", "Q: How to bring an application made in Automator to the foreground upon launch? I've created an application with AppleScript in Automator.\nI've created a Service in Automator which launches the aforementioned app.\nThe Service is triggered by a keyboard shortcut.\nThe problem is that upon launch, the application's dialog box has a light gray top bar. I have to click anywhere on the dialog for the dialog to turn to the darker gray, which shows that the app is now selected.\nIs it possible for my application to do this automatically?\n\nA: Have a look at the activate command in the AppleScript Language Guide Commands Reference.\n\nactivate  Brings an application to the front, and opens it if it is on the local computer and not already running.\n\nI'd add activate me after the start of the on run handler.\n\nA: I see that the OP's question says \"an application made in Automator.\"\nBut, as an aside, and since this question has most of the right keywords to solve the problem I was having (applications launched from an Automator \"Run Shell Script\" action showing up behind other open applications)…\nIf you are launching a GUI application from a shell script action in Automator and find that it is not coming to the foreground and receiving focus, try something like\nopen -a ProgramName.app --args \"$@\"\n\nand set \"Pass input\" to \"as arguments\". The \"$@\" will be expanded as an individually-quoted list of the input arguments, separated by whitespace (this is a feature of the Unix shell, not Automator).\nThis works great, for example, for creating a \"Writer\" Automator app that launches LibreOffice Writer (open -a LibreOffice.app --args --writer \"$@\"), and also accepts drag-and-dropped files.\nIf you are still having trouble getting the application to come to the foreground (maybe it's already open, for example), try appending these lines to the action in Automator:\nsleep 1  # adjust as you see fit\nosascript <<<'tell application \"ProgramName.app\" to activate'\n\n", "Q: Remove @me.com and icloud.com.

HOW DO I DELETE THIS?\n\nA: If what you are asking is how to delete an Apple ID from Apple's servers the answer in short it that you can not. At least they do not have a simple process to do so. There is no way to remove an Apple ID from Apple directly from their associated websites, instead you have to call Apple support directly and see if they will assist you.\nIf you are worried about information that you have stored on Apple's database you can go into your Apple ID settings (https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin) and remove information you no longer want them to save.\n", "Q: How to make \"Go to Folder\" show current path?

In fact, they even state there is an optional Power Supply available:\n\nSo, the PS is only required if you can't get the 5V .5A from the bus (host).  In this case you have a couple of options\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Power Supply\n\n*Use a powered hub\n\n\nAs for going Thunderbolt to Firewire then to USB, I am a proponent of using the \"right tool for the job.\"  Can you do it?  Yes.  But it's a bodge.1 \nInsead, go directly from TB to USB with a  [Thunderbolt to USB adapter][2]\n\nFinally, you never did say why your USB connector doesn't work nor which one. In my experience, it could be a very inexpensive fix to repair the connector.  This is definitely something you should look into. \n\n1 Bodge: Verb. 1. To do a poor job or repair. \n2. To cobble (something together). E.g.\"I bodged together that furniture out of driftwood and old egg boxes.\" From A Dictionary of UK slang.\n\nA: In your question what did you mean by: Using a USB hub from the remaining USB port is not really an option as I use it for my Traktor Pro 2 Soundcard.\nI can't think of any reason why using a USB hub would be a problem? If it's a concern about power requirements then there are many powered USB hubs available.\nAs for a Thunderbolt to FireWire adapter and then a FireWire to USB adapter, this should work.\nHowever, if it was me I'd go with a powered USB hub.\n\nA: \nI have been looking around for a Thunderbolt to USB hub/dock but they\nare quite expensive.\n\nYes, indeed they are, and they are not likely to get cheaper.  There is not a lot of market now for these devices and it's only getting smaller.  Economy of scale is not in your favor.\n\nI was thinking will a Thunderbolt to FireWire adapter, Then Firewire\nto USB work?\n\nNo, that's not likely to work.  First is because I have yet to see any FireWire to USB adapters.  Second, even if they did exist FireWire is not required to provide power to the connected device, the most common FireWire (400 Mbps) has less bandwidth than USB 2.0 (480 Mbps), and the fastest FireWire standard (3 Gbps) is slower than USB 3.0 (5 Gbps).  If it is power or bandwidth you are running out of from USB then FireWire will likely come up short too.\n\nIf not, are there any other options in expanding the USB ports without\nusing the last remaining USB port?\n\nNot really.\nThere's the option of buying Thunderbolt or FireWire devices to replace your USB devices.\n", "Q: Mac Wi-Fi / AirPort icon has an X through it I have a problem with my AirPort / Wi-Fi hardware on my MacBook Pro.\nI updated to macOS 10.12, Sierra, and then the Wi-Fi would not work. Nothing I do has made any change. I have tried SMC and NVRam resets. Have used a different AirPort card. Different hard drive as well.\nI just get the AirPort menu bar icon with an X through it. Any help would be great as it is doing my head in.\n\nA: You are not alone in seeing this problem; the Apple discussion Hello, my iMac's wifi icon has an x in it and I cannot access wireless wifi on it, … has attracted a couple of answers.\nLinc Davis's answer suggests the following possible cause and a multi-step solution:\nSometimes the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar may falsely indicate that Wi-Fi is unavailable. That could happen if you switch between network locations, one of which doesn't have a Wi-Fi service.\nOpen the Network pane in System Preferences. A list of available network services appears on the left.\n\n\n*\n\n*If Wi-Fi is in the list, select it, then from the popup menu labeled with a gear icon at the bottom of the list, select Make Service Active. Click Apply.\n\n*If Wi-Fi is not in the service list, click the plus-sign button at the bottom of the list, and then select Wi-Fi from the  Interface menu in the sheet that drops down. Click Create, then Apply.\nIf there is a closed padlock icon in the lower left corner of the preference pane, click it and enter your administrator password to unlock the settings.\nIf the above steps don't solve the problem, Linc goes on to suggest deleting the computer's /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist file and restarting.\nFull instructions are in the discussion.\n", "Q: Which adapter is best on last Macbook Pro 2016 for Thunderbolt 2 dual monitors? My typical setup is to plugin in my MBP with lid closed into dual monitors. I typically bring back and forth to work in backpack, where I also have dual monitors. All of my monitors go from DVI port into a Thunderbolt 2 like so: \n\nNow I just got the new Macbook Pro delivered and the lack of ports is really frustrating. Looks like this: \n\nThe ports on my old MBP is really nicely set. All are on one side and work nicely with my desk setup so that the wires all run behind my desk. On my new MBP each side only has 2 ports (except for the headphone jack). I am not able to find a way to get both displays into one USB-C where I can use the other for my USB hub for example. \nMy question is, is there any sort of adapters that I can use to get to a similiar setup? All I've been able to find is the Thunderbolt 2 -> 3 converter adapters, but since there is only 2 ports on each side, I'd still have to pull in more stuff into the other side of the MBP (USB, power, headphones). \nFeels like Apple went all in for the pretty minimalistic approach in expense of convienence. \nIs there no USB-C hubs that support dual monitors? \n\nA: You can do that with for example a Thunderbolt 3 dock (or Thunderbolt 2 dock if you have an older one). Models from Belkin, OWC, etc. allow you to plugin the two monitors, your USB device, charger and audio into the dock and only have a single cable going into the new MacBook Pro.\n\nA: So far there are no USB-C docks that provide the \"correct\" amount of power for the MacBook Pro's, so far that I've seen. The Kensington SD4600P USB-C Docking Station provides just under the required power for a 13\" MBPR and not even close to what the 15\" needs.\nDepending on what you need, you could use the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter. That includes pass through power capabilities. That adapter would give you one monitor, and power, and USB for ethernet if you wanted. Then add one more USB-C to HDMI adapter and you're done. Two plugs and you've covered power, dual monitor and whatever USB needs you have.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra keeps running out of application memory Every time I turn my Mac on, after a while the app memory just runs out.\n\n\nThese are just from 10min apart, after working for a while. I need help figuring what those Installers are and why the kernel_task is taking so much memory. Those Google Chrome Helpers also look extremely unnecessary.\nThe only thing that 'solves' this is restarting the computer. How can I get rid of this cycle?\n\nA: Chrome is probably launching when macOS starts, and tabs from your previous session and reopening, so you're instantly running out of memory.\nTry the Chrome plugin, The Great Suspender. Also try running Dr. Cleaner continuously in the background.\n\nA: But the answer is right there. You have zillions of \"Chrome Helper\" processes eating up all your memory. Quick Chrome and recheck your state. \nWhy Chrome behaves like this?  Either:\n\n\n*\n\n*you keep a zillion pages open, each with some very-heavy web app (like Google docs and such)\n\n*you have a \"malware\" installed on your Mac which leeches on Chrome, making it open lot's of extensions on your behalf. Download and run \"MalwareBytes\" free malware remover for Mac to see if that's the case.\n\n*Have you joined any of those vicious \"programs\" of \"download this and receive 99 cents per run of our software\" ??? Maybe you rolled into some bad program where you actually \"sell your Mac cycles\" for others? That \"Chrome helper\" is a background-only mac \"Daemon\" running within Chrome, and doing something. It would be nice to know what.\n\n\nAs a first step - close all your chrome windows and tabs - individually, and manually. make sure no page is open in chrome - and look again on your activity monitor. If those hogs are all gone - you're done. Quit Chrome, and you're clear.\n", "Q: Rename files before saving I have a certain structure in my files (YYYY-MM-DD_name of file_MYINITIALS). I could rename existing files in batch but to do so I would have to know where they are, as they are in different folders this doesn't seem to be right solution for me. \nIs there then way to add the above structure to each file I save? I.e. each time I create a new file a script or so would add YYYY-MM-DD_ before the file name and MYINITIALS right after/before I click \"save\". \n\nA: You could create a program that uses Apple's FSEvents to be signalled every time a new file is created - then it could use a standard move command to give the file a new name.\nAnother options is using Folder Actions, but that would require you knowing which folders you want to monitor. The folder action could execute a small script you put together, that simply append the date and initials to the file name.\n", "Q: Is it possible to view two Apple IDs at the same time on the Find iPhone app? Do you need the same Apple ID to find my iPhone ? I have 3 iPhones 2 with the same Apple ID 1 with a different I'd can it be done?\n\nA: If you add the second Apple ID as a family member on Family Sharing, you can see all your Family devices on Find my iPhone.\nOr you can enter the credentials of the second Apple ID on any phone on the Find my iPhone app -or iCloud- and look for it.\nIf you’re willing to let some functionality out (no remotely playing sound, or locking and changing passcode), you can use Apple’s Find Friends and invite any Apple ID. You can then see the user on a map, set geofences and get informed on that user movements, but they can remove you at any time.\n", "Q: Disable SIP without recovery mode Before you respond that this isn't possible, hear me out. I have a Mac Pro 4,1 (with 5,1 firmware), running MacOS Sierra. I want to disable System Integrity Protection (otherwise known as SIP), but have run into a snag. I don't have a flashed graphics card, so I can't see my boot screen (or recovery mode or safe mode) on my computer. Therefore I can't see how to disable SIP on my computer. I have tried:\nBoot Mac Pro into target disk mode and connect MacBook Air (OS X 10.9 - pre-SIP) via FireWire To MP. Boot MBA from Mac Pro's recovery partition, (MacOS 10.12 recovery). Disable SIP, reboot. Doing this worked on the MBA. But when I turned on the Mac Pro again, SIP was enabled. I assumed that because of this, the SIP disable was linked to the hardware.\nQuestion 1: Is this assumption correct?\nQuestion 2: is it possible to disable the SIP without using the graphics card in the Mac Pro? I have an iMac running MacOS Sierra and a MBA running OS X 10.9 at my disposal. Possible solutions can include (but don't have to be limited to): ssh, screensharing, target disk mode).\nI would appreciate any help. Please post questions as comments and feel free to suggest edits. Thank you!\n\nA: This blind method worked for me:\n\nIn order to disable or enable SIP (System Integrity Protection)\nwithout being able to see recovery mode and launch the terminal, you\ncan use single-user recovery mode which takes you right into a command\nprompt.\nReboot Mac holding down CmdRS\nWait 30-60 seconds depending on how fast your boot disk is.\nThen hit ENTER a few times to get to the command prompt\nTo DISABLE SIP: type csrutil disable; reboot and press Enter\nTo ENABLE SIP: type csrutil enable; reboot and press Enter\nOnce back in macOS you can check the status of SIP with the following\ncommand: csrutil status\n\nNote: This will only work if the recovery OS is =>10.11 (El Cap). If you upgraded (chances are as we are talking a 2011 Mac, the recovery partition will be @ Lion or some such and will not have csrutil in it. Work around is to \"recover\"from a boot USB with =>10.11 on it.\n\nA: It is possible to boot into Recovery with Single User Mode.\nTo do this:\nHold the Option (⌥) key during initial boot to get to the Startup Manager.\nWhile holding Command (⌘)-S, select the Recovery boot volume.\nThis will give you Single User Recovery Mode, a terminal from which you can run\ncsrutil disable\nand reboot.\nYou are then free to continue to normal Single User Mode to disable the Extensions that use the GPU and reboot to a system with terrible graphics, but from which you can more easily recover/backup what you need before starting repairs.\n\nA: By experimentation I just discovered that it is possible to reboot holding Command-R-S and this will enter a single user recovery mode (combination of Command R for recovery and Command S for single user). This undocumented feature worked when rebooting out of recovery mode with the select disk dialogue, may or may not work with other reboot types. worked on Sierra on a 2010 macbook pro, other versions untested.\n\nA: Edit: to answer your actual question, you can't do it from anywhere except Recovery Mode, so anything you do must be done from there.\nTested on a similar 4,1 upgraded to 5,1 [but I have a flashed graphics card so I could see what I was doing]\nReboot & at the chimes hold  Cmd ⌘   R  for about 10s.\nWait until you get to Recovery Mode, which for me took approx 45s from the chimes [I'm on SSD but I think it may have chosen a Recovery on another HD to actually boot from] Give it a minute or so just to be safe.\n Fn   Ctrl ⌃   F2  will switch focus to the menu bar, specifically the Apple logo, top left.   \nIt appears that whatever you have set in System Prefs > Keyboard for \"Use all F1, F2 keys as standard function keys\" that this option is disabled in Recovery, so even though just  Ctrl ⌃   F2  works for me in a running OS, in Recovery I needed the added  Fn  key.\nFrom there, you can navigate using the arrow keys \nPic from https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/254167/85275\n \nFrom that you can see that Terminal is 4 to the right, then 4 down.\nIt's 4 not 3 because the first down arrow opens the menu.\nHit Enter & Terminal will launch.\nType csrutil disable & hit Enter\nType reboot & hit Enter.\nIf it reboots, you got it right - otherwise you'll have to have another guess.\nBTW, golden rule, as you have discovered, is keep your crappy old stock Apple card somewhere safe, for occasions such as this ;-)\nAdditional note:  Fn   Ctrl ⌃   F2  is a toggle.

Problem is, the iMac in question here runs Snow Leopard and predates Target Display Mode.\nFurthermore, this iMac was just replaced. I am attempting to salvage parts from the iMac, including its display and hard drive, to use in a PC build.\nIs there any way a very old iMac can be used just as a passive monitor?\n\nA: 27\" iMac as old as the late 2009 will support TDM (Target Display Mode), and TDM is available on Snow Leopard, as long as the iMac supports TDM. If your iMac is 27\" model, it is more likely to support TDM.  \nIf it doesn't support TDM, there is a DIY method, which requires a lot of hardware modification, including soldering and acquiring appropriate LCD controller so that its built-in monitor can be used as a normal external monitor.  The work involved, the time required, and the cost of parts required for the procedure are often too prohibitive and not worth the effort.  For all that, it's probably better to buy a brand new monitor for less.  I've once tried to convert the beloved iMac G4 for such use, but ultimately failed, although few people have tried and succeeded through extreme measures.  See The 17\" iMac G4 to DVI - The Easiest Method Ever (So Far).\nFinally, if the iMac is still running, I recommend the software solution. It allows the old iMac to be used as a secondary display to an existing PC or Mac (through VNC and the like).  I've had success with Screen Recycler , which cost around $30, but is well-worth the price.  If it is an older PPC-based iMac and it runs Tiger, I recommend ScreenSpanningDoctor.  Newer software, such as AirDisplay works as well, but it requires Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: I don't have permissions to open my files? There are several questions that seem similar, e.g., TextEdit shows dialogs about not having permission to open any files, but they're not exactly the same and none of the suggested fixes work.  Correction: when I posted, I forgot that one of the ideas in those posts I hadn't tried.  Because I was doing a long slow backup via rsync, I did not reboot.  This morning after that completed, a reboot has removed the problem.  But it would still be nice to understand why, and how to prevent—since it happened again today (see comments).\nFor more than a month, I've been using the \"re-open windows on login\" option to keep a few Textedit files easily accessible.

Prior to this, whenever I enabled Bluetooth on my iPhone, it was instantaneous: turn it on, boom, it was enabled. \nHowever, since the iOS10 update, it can now take up to a full 20-30 seconds between pressing the button and for Bluetooth to be enabled (with the little icon showing in the top right). At first I thought it was broken, but now I'm used to the long delay and it irks me. \nI've tried rebooting the phone, which appeared to have fixed it, but it was just a bit faster in enabling Bluetooth the first time I tried it afterwards; all subsequent attempts were as painfully slow as before (and I'm not convinced that first time wasn't just a coincidence). \nIs there any particular reason for this with the latest iOS update? And/or is there anything I can do to fix it?\nUpdate\nThis isn't a fix fix (which is why I'm reluctant to post it as an answer), but: when turning on Bluetooth via the control pane (flicking upward from the bottom of your iPhone screen), don't immediately dismiss the screen. If you keep it open for just a couple of seconds, usually Bluetooth turns on much more quickly. I've found that if I don't do this, Bluetooth might not come on for 20-30 seconds, and if I then open the control pane subsequently, the Bluetooth icon is highlighted... and then appears to turn itself off again.\nUpdate #2\nAs of iOS 10.3x this no longer appears to be an issue on any of my iOS devices.\n\nA: I'm having this issue as well. I went to Apple, they replaced my iPhone 6S due to both the bluetooth coming up with an error in diagnostics, as well as the battery issue thats plaguing 6S users. However, I am still having the same problem. I am convinced its software related and waiting for the new iOS patch. A bit concerned that the hardware diagnostics at the Genius Bar found a Bluetooth error as well, hopefully the software isn't damaging the hardware.\n\nA: I have had same issue... it started in iOS 10.1 it was fine up to 10.0.2. I went to Apple Store with video of it on another phone as it was sometimes intermittent.. They did diags and found no errors but replaced it for me anyway.. The new one has same issue...

Things are really faster now, but one thing I noticed is that the CPU rises to peaks quite unprecedented with my original HDD. In video conversion, the CPU temperature soars to 95 degrees Celsius but the fans seem sluggish to kick in before the CPU temperature is 85 or so. The GPU temperature is also quite high. Of course, after they start spinning up they both work around 6000, but they cannot lower the CPU temperature below 92 degrees Celsius. I have stared to think of putting the HDD back. In idle mode while I am not working with my mac, the CPU temp is around 49, but on startup and when working with apps like pages the temperature is around 66 degrees.\nWhat do think? When do your fans usually kick in while you are having a cpu-intensive process running in your mac?\nUpdate: Here are two images related to CPU usage and temperature. I hope it helps.\n\n\nRegards\n\nA: It is not a problem that your CPU is at 95 degrees celcicus for a short period of time.\nThe mid-2010 MacBook Pro with Core i5 processor is specified to withstand up to 105 degrees.\nSo unless you have some kind of practical problem (for example the underside of the laptop being too hot to handle), there's really nothing to worry about.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force specific apps to run and remain in a specific order? I've been trying for days to figure out the correct way to phrase this question, so please do not hesitate to correct me.\nI have four apps that I always run in full screen mode and I always have them in a specific order. It looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dashboard\n\n*Spotify\n\n*IRC App\n\n*Desktop\n\n*Browser\n\n*Sublime Text\n\n\nThe problem I would like to solve is, even though I set them in this order, they don't always stay in that order. I can't figure out why. The browser, for example, will sometimes slide over to the left side of the desktop.\nSo two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to have these specific apps open on start up?\n\n*Is there a way to lock them into these positions, both on start up and during normal use?\n\n\nI'm running a MacBook on OS X El Capitan v10.11.6\n\nA: In OS X 10.11 the default under System Preferences > Mission Control for the Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use is checked. So to not have your Spaces rearranged on you, uncheck the checkbox for that setting.\n\nTo have an App tied to a particular Desktop, open the target App on that Desktop, then control-click (right-click) the target App's Dock Tile and select: Options > Assign To > This Desktop\n\nTo have an App launch automatically upon Login, go to System Preferences > Users & Groups > select the User > click Login Items and add the App.\n\n\nA: I believe you will need a third-party tool to manage this, such as Lingon ($10), Startupizer ($10), or Keyboard Maestro ($36). With any of these applications (and probably others), you can set the order to launch applications in and optionally set delays in between them.\n", "Q: How to lock screen of host machine with TDM on Sierra I regularly use my iMac as an external display for my macbook using target display mode (TDM).  Since upgrading my iMac to Sierra, the screen locking behavior has changed in a disturbing way.  I'm hoping there's a configuration flag I can set to revert to the old behavior.  Here's the situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*I unlock the iMac.

Right now, it seems using TDM is a major security hole for the iMac.\n\nA: This should not happen at all if your iMac locks itself after a period of time without TDM.\nTo lock your iMac's account after a period of time, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click General.\n\n\n*Click the lock icon  to unlock it, then enter an administrator name and password.\n\n\n*Click Advanced.\n\n\n*Select “Log out after... minutes of inactivity.”\n\n\n*Set the amount of time before the user is automatically logged out.\n(quoted from https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18670?locale=en_US)\n.\nIt definitively is supported to log out a user while using Target Display Mode (TDM):\n\nAny apps that are open on your iMac remain open and active while your iMac is in Target Display Mode. (...)\nIf you've set your iMac to automatically log out, apps are paused or closed when this happens but your iMac remains in Target Display Mode.\n\nFrom: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592#options\n.\nAlso check these options in System Preferences:\n\n*\n\n*Energy Saver > Wake for network access (uncheck)\n\n*Security & Privacy > General >

Does Family Sharing allow others to see the free Apps that you've downloaded or is it just the paid Apps?\nI did search online but couldn't seem to find confirmation. \n\nA: Yes, but not without looking.\nMore specifically to your iPhone scenario, to see what has been downloaded by a family member, you would need to follow the steps outlined below.\nApp Store\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into the App Store app\n\n*tap on Updates at bottom right\n\n*tap on Purchased at top of screen\n\n*a list of family members will appear\n\n*tap on the family member to view their purchases\n\n\nNote that by purchases we mean all downloads, as free apps are effectively treated as though they were purchased for $0.00.\niTunes\nA similar process is required to view their music, movie and other iTunes purchases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into the iTunes app\n\n*Tap on the More icon at bottom right\n\n*Tap on Purchased\n\n*a list of family members will appear\n\n*tap on the family member to view their purchases\n\n\nOnce again, by purchases we mean all downloads.\niBooks\nAnd, with iBooks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into the iBooks app\n\n*Tap on the Purchased icon at bottom right\n\n*a list of family members will appear\n\n*tap on the family member to view their purchases\n\n\nOnce again, by purchases we mean all downloads.\n\nA: Yes, I just checked this.

Does that mean it was wiped clean?  Or perhaps I never could see it using icloud (find-my-iphone)?  \n\nA: He can wipe it without your passcode, provided it is not locked to your iCloud account, which by the sounds of it, it's not. \nThis can be done by connecting the phone to iTunes and then putting it in recovery mode. Quoting from Apple website page here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect device to iTunes.\n\n*Put in recovery mode: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time. Don't release when you see the Apple logo.

From my research, it seems that macOS transitioned from 32-bit x86 to 64-bit x64 across the following versions:\n                                Kernel  App Support\n    10.4        Tiger           x86     x86\n    10.5        Leopard         x86     x86/x64\n    10.6        Snow Leopard    x86/x64 x86/x64\n    10.7        Lion            x86/x64 x86/x64\n    10.8        Mountain Lion   x64     x86/x64\n10.9 - 10.12    ...             x64     x86/x64\n\nThat is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Support for x64 apps was added in 10.5.\n\n*A 64-bit kernel was introduced in 10.6, and the 32-bit kernel was removed in 10.8.\n\n*It is possible to run 32-bit apps with a 64-bit kernel and (unlike Linux and Windows) 64-bit apps with a 32-bit kernel.\n\n\nIs this accurate?\n\nA: You're pretty much on the money. In summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X Panther actually included very basic support for the PowerPC G5 64-bit processor.\n\n*Mac OS X Tiger was actually the first to add some support for 64-bit applications, so long as these did not utilise any of the GUI libraries (and obviously only on machines with 64-bit processors).\n\n*Mac OS X Leopard extended support for 64-bit apps by providing native support via its libraries and frameworks (including GUI libraries) so that 64-bit Cocoa applications could be developed.\n\n*Mac OS X Snow Leopard and above could only be installed on Macs with Intel processors, and introduced a number of fully 64-bit Cocoa applications (e.g. QuickTime X), and most applications were recreated to use the 64-bit x86-64 architecture (although iTunes was a notable exception to this!) This meant these applications could run in 32-bit mode on machines with 32-bit processors, and in 64-bit mode on machines with 64-bit processors. And yes, the kernel was updated so that it could run in 64-bit mode on some  limited hardware, and only by default on Mac Pros, while other newer Macs were capable of running the kernel bit did not do so by default. In a nutshell, Snow Leopard could run both 32-bit and 64-bit apps on Intel Macs.\n\n*Mac OS X Lion but supported both 32-bit and 64-bit apps. However, Mac OS X Lion was the last (actually, only the second along with Snow Leopard) that maintained both 32-bit and 64-bit kernels. However, unlike Snow Leopard, the OS X Lion only ran on 64-bit Intel processors.\n\n*Yes, it's possible to run 32-bit apps with a 64-bit kernel.\n\n*Yes, it's possible to run 64-bit apps with a 32-bit kernal, so long as you have a 64-bit CPU.\n\n*As for whether 64-bit apps can run on a 32-bit kernel on Linux and Windows, I am not 100% sure this is impossible with all versions/flavours of these operating systems (e.g. there are Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education versions of Windows) and I am not intimately familiar with all their differences. However, I can say that running 64-bit apps on a 32-bit kernel is certainly rare for a consumer-level operating system.\n\n", "Q: MacBook not out-putting sound to Bluetooth devices I have a MacBook running macOS Sierra which has been successfully connected to my Logitech Bluetooth audio device.  Recently it stopped working.  Specifically, in sys-prefs/sound it won't select the device.  In other words, the Bluetooth connection is made, but it won't set as a sound device.  I checked this with other Bluetooth sound devices from other manufacturers, so I believe it's a general Bluetooth audio issue.\nDoes anybody have any insight into this?\n\nA: Your question doesn't specify what you've tried to resolve this.

A common thing that some people do to diagnose that problem is to open the phone and disconnect the connectors to the screen, clean them a bit, and then put them back.\nI tried to do it, but once the screen was back in place and I replugged the battery (because I unpluged it for safety reasons when I removed the screen), the iPhone wouldn't turn on.\nI've tried the same procedure a couple of times but it still won't turn on.\nIt's been 3 months now. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: I know this is a dead thread, but you may have possibly bricked the device. Try to make sure all screws inside are intact and screwed in properly and all cables are plugged in properly. You could have also damaged the battery. If you have another iPhone of the same model you can try swapping out the battery and see if it works in the other phone. If it does not, try replacing the battery. If it does work, try to turn it on and then call it or use find my iPhone or plug it in (just do something that would make noise and make sure the ringer switch is on so it will make noise). If it does not work you may have a damaged logic board and you will probably be better off buying a new phone.\n", "Q: How to restore a time machine backup of a USB drive to a new USB drive? One of my external USB disks died. I want to restore the time machine backup to a new (bigger) external USB disk. \nI could just copy the latest backup to the new disk, but I want to keep the backup history, so that time machine uses the new disk as a replacement for the old disk (with all the backup history).\n\nA: I found a solution that does use the existing backup. The trick is to use sudo tmutil associatedisk (see man tmutil).\nMy old disk was mounted under /Volumes/USB-old and the new disk is mounted as /Volumes/USB-new. My backup is under /Volumes/backups. (If your old and new disk have both the same name, you have to follow all of the steps, because the name of the disk is not sufficient to associate an old backup with a new disk)\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop time machine to do backups (in the preferences)\n\n*Restore the old data to the new disk:\nsudo tmutil restore /Volumes/backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBookPro/Latest/USB-old/* /Volumes/USB-new\n\n(note this does not restore files starting with . at the top level)\n\n*Tell time machine to associate the new disk to the old backups:\nsudo tmutil associatedisk /Volumes/USB-new /Volumes/backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBookPro/Latest/USB-old\n\n\n*Start time machine to do backups\nNow time machine does not try to backup the entire new disk. Instead, it creates incremental backups based on the old snapshot.\nHowever, it seems not possible to go back in history using Time Machine.\nI have tried to associate all old backups with the new disk without much success:\nfor dir in `find /Volumes/backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBookPro -maxdepth 2 -name USB-old`; do \n    echo sudo tmutil associatedisk /Volumes/USB-new $dir\ndone\n\n", "Q: Updated to iMovie 10.1.6: Movies and projects missing (MacOS: Sierra 10.12.1 , iMovie: 10.16)\nUPDATE:\nI see now I have TWO iMovie folders, one on my local drive (with some valid projects and movies) and another on my eternal drive (where everything was supposed to be).  With iMovie, I can only see the final movies only on my local drive. No Movies are found or visible that are on my eternal drive. So questions are:\n1. I am simply unable to see, open, find ANY final movie via iMovie that resides on the external drive.  Where are my movies?  iMovie is really inconvenient to say the least.\n2. How can I move/merge my local drive projects, folders, and etc into my external drive folder?\nORIGINAL:---------------\nI am missing movies and projects once I update to 10.1.6.

It seems every time I update iMovie a huge mess is left behind.  Any thoughts on how I can proceed?

On my work Mac (Sierra) I'm running a NodeJS webserver on localhost, port 3000. I need to access to it from Internet Explorer running in Parallels for testing purposes.\nI have searched and read and experimented extensively, and have thus far been stymied. My current situation is as follows:\nI've got a Parallels \"Host-Only\" network with my Mac at 10.37.129.2 and my virtual Windows box at 10.37.129.3\nPointing my IE to 10.37.129.2:3000 fails.\nI've jumped through every hoop imaginable to ensure port 3000 is open between the two, but nmap -p 3000 10.37.129.2 from the Windows side tells me port 3000 remains closed, as does Mac's Network Utility Port Scan software.\nSadly all guides and advice on the subject are either insufficiently similar, grossly outdated, or simply unsuccessful when attempted.\nAny progress you help me achieve is greatly appreciated.\n\nThe relevant portions of my server.js are:\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\nconst host = process.env.HOST || 'localhost';\nconst proxyTarget = process.env.PROXY || 'none';\n\n\nA: The \"technical background\" of the special behavior (at least on Macs) of using localhost as \"host constant\" is the specific nature of dns.js, which obviously binds the node http/https server to the interface it reverse-resolves to the const host (= localhost) with the help of mDNSResponder.\nThis is localhost > 127.0.0.1 > lo0.\nAny other interface like en0/en1 as physical interfaces or vnic0/vnic1 as Parallels' virtual interfaces won't be addressed/attached.\nTo solve this you may either\n\n\n*\n\n*set up a DNS-server like dnsmasq in Parallels' Host-only network and use the fqdn of the node http server host as host const\n\n*use the IP-address of the node http server in Parallels' Host-only network as host const\n\n*modify the hosts files of every host in Parallels' Host-only network and add a line like 10.37.129.2 testserver.example.com and use testserver.example.com as host const\n\nA: Just run in the terminal:\nifconfig\n\nAnd go to vnic0: inet address from the Parallels (like http://1x.2xx.5x.2:3000/ for ex.)\n\nA: The temporary solution is to edit server.js and set host = '10.37.129.2' or set the HOST system variable to 10.37.129.2 and read it in with host = process.env.HOST || 'localhost'. It may also be possible to edit /private/etc/hosts to map 10.37.129.2 to localhost, though my quick test of that failed.\nEverything was behaving precisely as expected. The localhost name is mapped to 127.0.0.1, and not to any network facing IP address. Thus 10.37.129.2, which was my Mac's IP on the virtual network shared with Windows running in Parallels, was never reaching localhost. This is correct and reasonable.\nAll credit goes to klanomath. Thanks!\n\nA: One of the way I could use it, I found my local IP4 address provided by the router. \nFrom Mac system preferences > Network > IP Address: 192.168.x.xx\nAnd let say if you access it in Mac with http://localhost:3000 you can do it also with http://192.168.x.xx:3000 from Mac itself and from Parallel Windows OS with shared network configuration.\nThis IP address could be changed each time you restart the router or choose another router etc.\nCurrently, I'm using Parallels Desktop 12\n", "Q: Can one MacBook charge another over USB-C? When two 2016 MacBook Pros are connected over USB-C, can they transmit power?  Could an adapter look like a phone from one side but like a charger from the other, so that it would convince one MacBook to power another?\nHow does the 2016 MacBook Pro know to draw power when connected to a charger, but to provide power when connected to a phone?  I see that wattage is negotiated when they are first connected, but is who-charges-who also negotiated??\n\nA: Technically it would be possible to trick the MacBook Pro to think another device is actually a different device to what it is (e.g. that a connected  MacBook is in fact an iPhone).\nHowever, this would not achieve the goal of charging one MacBook from another MacBook. According to Apple:\n\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016) and MacBook (13-inch, Late 2016, Four\n  Thunderbolt 3 Ports) can power two devices that use up to 15 watts,\n  and two more devices that use up to 7.5 watts. It doesn't matter which\n  side of your MacBook Pro that they're connected to—power is delivered\n  on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207256\nMacBooks typically require in the range of 55 watts to 90 watts of power in order to charge (depending on the model, e.g. the late-2016 13\" MacBook Pros require 60 watts, while the 15\" models require 85 watts).\nAs a result, the amount of power being delivered from the MBP via it's ThunderBolt ports would not be enough to charge another MacBook.\n\nA: Yes. Just use a good-quality TypeC-TypeC cable to connect the two Macbooks. I use one from Apple Store and also a Surface Book cable. The trick is, the USB-C cable is directional, although it may look symmetrical. If it doesn't seem to work the way you intended, reverse the cable and connect again.\nI routinely use my Macbook Pro 15inch 2016 to charge my colleague's New Macbook during meetings and I also once charged another Macbook Pro (13inch) during a hackathon. The output doesn't always cover consumption so they may still lose battery life, but it does slows down power drain.\n\nA: Yes you can. I finally figured out how. \nUse a dongle and hook them up like this:\npower supply > usb-c cable > mbp > usb-c cable > usb-c multi-port dongle > mbp2\n\nI've tested it with the UpTab displayport with power delivery adapter and with the Apple multiport adapter (A1621).\nIn my experience, 15w is enough to power and charge the 15\" mbp.\nHere are discharge rates I've observed on my laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Idle w/min screen brightness: 4.25w\n\n*Idle w/max screen brightness: 7.7w\n\n*Chrome open, no tabs, max brightness: 8.6w\n\n*Chrome open, 2 gmail tabs, 1 pandora tab, max volume: 16.5w\n\n*Chrome open, playing 1 YouTube video, min brightness: 9.4w\n\n*Chrome open, playing Spotify, min brightness: 6.05w\n\n*iTunes open (Chrome closed), playing song, min brightness: 6.1w\n\n\nThe second mpb will only receive 15w from the first. An app like coconut battery can help you see how quickly your laptop is charging.\nUsing this method, you can even trick your laptop into thinking that it is charging itself. (And then you could upload that video on YouTube, claiming to discover infinite energy, and profit on the ad revenue)\nThe OEM power supply for the 2016 15\" mbp has 3 output modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*4.3A @ 20.2v = 86w\n\n*3A @ 9v = 27w\n\n*2.4A @ 5.2V = 12.48w\n\n\nSo even the OEM power supply will occasionally supply only 12.48w to the mpb.\nUpdate:\nAfter playing around with this more, the above method will work if you want to charge 2 identical devices. But if you have a 15\"mbp and a 13\"mbp, it seems like the larger device always supplies power to the smaller device. I don't have one available currently to verify exact charging watts. Charging a 15\"mpb from 0% to 100% battery takes about 8 hours at 15w. This assumes that the laptop is off or is sleeping. In a pinch, I've worked 8 hours with my 15\"mbp plugged into my 18w usb-c phone charger. I was able to maintain the battery's charge during light to medium load. The move to usb-c for power has been awesome. You could conceivably charge your laptop with the 5w iPhone charger, but it would take about 15 hours to fully charge while shut down (assuming a 75wH battery and 5w charge rate and no inefficiencies due to charging), I'll have to test this out tonight to verify that it works.\n\nA: I was missing my primary charger for my 15in MacBook pro for a couple days, and I successfully charged it with the charger for my USB-C tablet.  I made sure to only have it plugged in when it was off, it was definitely slow, and I do not know the exact power stats from the charger, but it definitely does not take a full 85 watts to charge a 2016 MacBook Pro 15\".  I would not recommend a solution like this with any frequency, as it's probably not great for the battery.  \n", "Q: How can you unhide the file extension of an application created in Automator? I've created an application with AppleScript in Automator.\nWhen I was saving the application, I made sure that the \"Hide extension\" box was unchecked, like so:\n\nBut once the application was saved, the extension did not appear after the filename in Finder.\nWhen I right-click on the file in Finder and click Get Info, I am presented with the following:\n\nAfter unlocking the padlock in the bottom-right corner of the Get Info window, the \"Hide extension\" box is still greyed out.\nI have also tried renaming the file by pressing Enter while the file is selected in Finder, and manually appending \".app\" to the end of the filename. Although I am able to successfully do so without triggering an error message, the \".app\" bit is removed from the filename instantly.\n\nA: I believe that the System automatically by default hides the .app filename extension regardless of unchecking the Hide extension checkbox upon being saved and the Hide extension checkbox on the Get Info sheet will be grayed out when the .app filename extension is present. You'll need to send feedback to Apple on this one.\nThe only way I know how to override this in Finder is to check the Show all filename extensions checkbox under Advanced Finder Preferences. This of course then shows all filename extensions that are set to hidden, not just the .app filename extension.\n\n", "Q: Can I just move SSD from 13inch MBP to 15 inch? Mid 2010 13 inch MBP is under 10.11.6 while the 15 inch is a 2012 non-retina model that is under macOS Sierra. I've been told that this is possible earlier but would like to hear form more people. Some are saying Macs are hardware independent, some say they are, so I need a consistent answer. The 15 inch currently has a HDD which is not going to cut it for me. \nWhat do you suggest I do to move my 13 inch's SSD + data into the 15 inch safely. I have a bunch of environments setup which would take so much time to set up again, so I'm trying to make the switch safely. \n\nA: Yes you can make that move. Whether or not your environments will transfer I cannot say: it depends whether they are hardware-independent like MacOS. You should have at least one (possibly two, if you're very concerned) backups of your data. These can take the forms of: clone the drive (using Carbon Copy Cloner or similar), time machine backups, or a disk image of the entire SSD. This way if there is a problem during or after the move, everything will be recoverable. After making sure your data is secure, follow a repair guide (I have found that generally iFixit and Other World Computing make good tutorials/video guides) to remove the SSD from the first computer and put it into the second computer.\nA few people recommend doing NVRAM and SMC resets before booting the new combination. Try doing these and then booting. Test your apps and environments to make sure everything is working okay. I'd suggest keeping a backup on hand until you know that everything worked. If things didn't work, you can try wiping the SSD and restoring to the new computer from backup, or if you want to revert back to the old setup you knew worked, you could do that as well.\nGood luck! Make sure that you understand everything before you do it. Feel free to ask questions or challenge my answer if you have heard otherwise.\n", "Q: How to share Photos.app videos to YouTube directly? While it's great to have a quick upload to Vimeo (System Preferences app → Extensions → Share Menu) in Photos.app, what about a share extension to quickly upload videos from Photos to YouTube? Does such an extension exist that can be added to macOS?\n\nA: While such an extension doesn't exist natively in macOS, the desired functionality can be added with the support of a 3rd party app.\nVideo Uploader for YouTube is a macOS app which lets you easily upload your videos to YouTube.\nThe app also installs a Finder and Photos.app extension which lets you upload to YouTube directly from Finder or from within the Photos app.\n\nA: Well, you could always import them into iMovie which allows sharing to YouTube.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start in iMovie and create a new project.\n\n*Navigate to Media, you will see Photos as a Media source.\n\n*After finding the clip, drag it to the editing area of iMovie.\n\n*Share using share icon in the upper left, YouTube would be a selectable choice\n\n\nA: You can drag and drop directly from Photos to the upload page now.\nIt may seem like it's not working but just wait a little longer.\n", "Q: Has anyone successfully got 2560 x 1600 resolution with the new macbook pros (late 2016) *over dual link dvi*? So I've been using the Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter for years to connect to a DELL 3007WFP which only supports dual-link DVI input. Now I want to connect the new macbook pro (late 2016) with thunderbolt 3 to this monitor.\nThere is no such thing as thunderbolt 3 to dual-link dvi. Called Apple and after one hour on the phone they told me to buy a thunderbolt 3 to thunderbolt 2 adapter in order to connect to the Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter. After a trip to the Apple Store and $29 less in my wallet that's for sure did not work!\nSo now I'm wondering: man can go and go back from the moon, but it can't make this work? I don't want to have to buy another monitor to use with the new macbook pro :(\nHas anyone successfully got that to work? Which adapters? How did you connect them?\nBelow the Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter I've been using for centuries:\n\n\nA: After a lot of trial and error (I've tried pretty much every adapter on the market) I have my MacbookPro (15inch) late 2016 working with my Dell 3007WFP monitor. Running at the full 2560x1600 resolution. \nAdapters used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Official Apple Dual DVI adapter.  \n\n*USB 3.1 Type C to Mini DisplayPort/Mini DP (Female) Adapter Cable Support 4K UHD  \n\n*External powered USB hub.\n\n\nSetup \n\n\n*\n\n*The USB of the dual dvi adapter goes into the USB hub.  \n\n*USB-C plugs into the MacbookPro, the female mini display port plugs  into the dual dvi adapter.\n\n\nA: I'm not convinced this is possible. I tried connecting the adapter you have to a USB-C to Mini Displayport adapter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016ZX5J0Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which caused the laptop to recognize the monitor, but it did not display any image.\n", "Q: How to prevent screen lock when MacBook AC adapter is unplugged? I use my MacBook connected to an external monitor via HDMI with the lid closed, and plugged in to AC power (in closed clamshell mode). If I disconnect the power cord (usually happens accidentally), the external monitor will lose signal, USB devices become disconnected and I need to enter my password and unlock the screen. Is there any way to prevent my Mac from stopping HDMI input when the power is unplugged in closed clamshell mode?\nI'm aware of NoSleep and InsomniaX, they work fine for preventing sleep when the lid is closed but they don't prevent screen lock when AC becomes unplugged (with closed clamshell mode).\n\nA: Those still searching, I found this seems to have solved it for me:\nsudo pmset disablesleep 1\n\nSource: https://medium.com/macoclock/how-to-prevent-macos-catalina-from-sleeping-when-connected-to-an-external-monitor-e2c876dadaf9\n\nA: Just in case you weren't aware of these options, or haven't already tried this, you could change the Battery settings under Energy Saver. \nYour question doesn't specify what version of macOS you're using, but here are some generic steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Energy Saver\n\n*Select the Battery tab\n\n*Set Computer Sleep to Never\n\n*Set Display Sleep to Never\n\n*Set Graphics to Higher Performance\n\n*Make sure Slightly dim the display when using this power source is unchecked\n\n*Make sure Automatically reduce brightness before display goes to sleep is unchecked\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\nLet us know how you go.\n\nA: From https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834, you need either \"An AC power adapter or an external display that provides power over USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C).\" This seems to assume that you only have USB-C ports as the new Macs do, but it stands to reason that the older macs are also using the power of the AC adapter to run the displays.\nSo the only solution is to get monitors that provide the power themselves.\n\nA: The easiest way for you to be able to use your Mac in clumshell mode is by downloading the Amphetamine app which is available free of charge and adds.\nYou can make this app be triggered given certain SQL-like conditions and it is going to keep your Macbook running even when the lid is closed and AC power not plugged in.\nFor example, my trigger schedule is enabled when my Macbook is connected to 2 or more external monitors. You can either create a trigger that suits your own case, or manually run the app when you want to.\n", "Q: How to drag window from anywhere on the window without using the title bar? I have made iTerm borderless, like this:\n\nSo, how can I move the window from anywhere inside the window and not just the title bar?\n\nA: macOS has the ability to mouse move windows natively, it just happens to be disabled by default.\nFrom Terminal:\ndefaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture -bool true\n\nThen log out/in or reboot for the setting to take effect.\nOnce rebooted, you can press control+command and left-click inside most windows and drag to move it.\nTo stop this behavior, you can delete this defaults setting from Terminal:\ndefaults delete -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture\n\nThen log out/in or reboot for the change to take effect.\n\nNote: This setting has worked since OS X Yosemite.\n\nA: To move any window, including borderless ones such as iTerm, you can move the mouse to any edge of the window until the cursor become a double-arrow, then click and hold while moving the mouse in a direction opposite of what would change the window size.\nAs an example, if you mouse over the top edge while the cursor is a double-arrow then click, hold and drag upwards or downwards it makes the window larger or smaller respectively, however if you drag left or right the window moves and once moving you can drag it anywhere and then release the mouse when you have the window where you want it.\nThe same paradigm applies on any edge of the window, moving the mouse to any edge, to where the cursor becomes a double-arrow then click and hold, and move in a direction that will not make the window larger or smaller will move the window instead.\n\nUpdate:\nThis answer was originally posted on Nov 21 '16 and the target OS was OS X 10.11 El Capitan and works as stated for that OS.\nThere have been recent comments about it on macOS High Sierra and if the Title Bar is showing then it can be moved as described however if the Title Bar is not showing then it can only be moved in the manner described from the top of the window. That said though I've noticed it can be a bit finicky but I can move it as described when tested under macOS 10.13.3 in reference to this update notice. \n", "Q: External Display is connected but only shows blue I have a early 2015 Retina Macbook. I recently got a Dell 1707FP monitor to use as an external display and I have an Aukey CB-C26 hub that provides me with an HDMI port. I'm using an Amazon basics HDMI to VGI cable. When I connect the monitor, the laptop recognizes an external monitor is connected but the monitor is just a blank blue screen. I know the cable works because when I connect using the same cable to my Windows laptop the monitor works fine. I also know my Aukey adapter works when I connect it to my TV using an HDMI cable.\nHere's the odd thing. If I restart my Macbook while it's connected to the external display, when the login page appears it appears on the external display. As soon as I put in my password, the display flickers and goes blue while the Macbook screen wakes up. So, the display is getting a usable signal at least some of the time. Any idea what is causing the blue screen on the external display and if there's anything I can do to change it?\n\nA: There are a number of possible causes and related solutions, but let's start with the most obvious solution first.\nReset your PRAM/NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). I suggest you reset this, here’s how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\nGive this a go and report back with how you go.\n", "Q: Replace text in Firefox, Pages, Terminal, BBEdit I have a MacBook Pro running the latest Sierra.\nI often find myself wanting to type I²C and have created System Preferences/Keyboard/Text to replace I2C.

I have set \"Correct spelling automatically\" and selected \"Check my spelling as I type\", which works for normal spelling errors.\n\nA: The specific parameter is Substitutions > Text Replacement, which isn't actually in System prefs at all.  \nIt's usually in the View menu of individual apps & as far as I'm aware needs to be specifically enabled wherever it appears.\nApps that don't have that menu item won't do replacement. BBEdit is one of those. Most Apple apps have it, but not Terminal.\n", "Q: How do I silence Messages from a single person on my Apple Watch? I have a particular person who continually messages me but I do not want to block them. Is there anyway to silence my watch so I do not get notifications from them, but I still get them from others?\n\nA: It is possible to set a conversation in Messages to \"Do Not Disturb\". This will cause notifications to stop and will put a small moon icon next to the conversation. Works great!\n", "Q: Add Touch Icon/WebClip for Blogger I use Blogger to run my blog, and I would like to use Apple's Touch icons.

If you notice, when you put in a search string at the search bar in Finder, Mac will also look up that string inside files it can read the text in (Word, Powerpoint, TextEdit files, even Java, PHP, C/C++ files -- as long as the file can be read as text).\nFor example, if you look up \"Hello World\", it's going to look for all files containing in their filename and in their file content the string \"Hello World\" and show those files.\nThis is very handy because I can just search up a line of code I want to search and then all the files with that line of code will show up, I wouldn't have to check every file individually as it will get very tedious once the files in my code work reach 20+ files. \nDoes anyone know how to make Finder search within files again?

What about the contents of the time capsule?\n\nA: It depends on what is between the airport & the outside world.  \nI'm assuming, as it's recommending bridge mode, that you have an ISP-supplied modem/router too, in which case that's what you should do; let the router handle NAT & DHCP & put the Airport in Bridge mode.\nHaving double NAT is 'not a good thing' & can cause loss in transmission.  \nOnly one device on a network - the one nearest the outside world - should be doing NAT [Network Address Translation]. This is what enables you to have multiple devices in the building, all of which can communicate with the outside world seamlessly, whilst only having one IP address at the router. The router handles which machine each message should be talking to.\nDHCP is what handles the offering of in-house IP addresses, to enable NAT to do its job, & also to ensure it knows which device has which IP address & that no two devices have the same address. It is dynamic, meaning you are never 100% certain to get the same address each time; but has a 'memory' of who was who & therefore tends towards giving the same device the same address each time.\nHaving more than one DHCP server on a network means devices may be randomly assigned an address by either server - confusion reigns.\nTo specifically answer your question, security is not an issue - nor is security actually handled by either of those services - but effective networking needs one of each service... & only one... done by the router nearest to the outside world.\n", "Q: Mail app unable to verify account name or password Lately, I 've been experiencing a problem with my hotmail account when I try to get connected through the mail.app on my Mac (I have the latest version of MacOS installed).

The slider offers no clue as to the numeric value of the brightness, so there is no way to return to it.\n\nA: One approach is to use the open source command line tool, brightness, to set the value on-demand. This way you could find your preferred brightness value and apply that value as needed, or per-profile.\nMac OS X Hints' discussion on Adjust brightness from Terminal covers the tool, how to compile it, and possible scripts to extend its use.\nOS X Daily has also covered the tool in Adjust screen brightness from command line.\n\nA: This just adds a basic how-to to Graham Miln's answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download source from here.\n\n*Open Commandline\n\n*Run gcc -std=c99 -o brightness brightness.c -framework IOKit -framework ApplicationServices This will create a binary in the same location\n\n\nTo print display(s) brightness:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run /path/to/binary/brightness -l\nThis will print for example: \ndisplay 0: main display, ID 0x42b19a8\ndisplay 0: brightness 0.282261\ndisplay 1: ID 0x4248e66\ndisplay 1: brightness 0.781247\nTo set display brightness\n\n\n*\n\n*Run /path/to/binary/brightness -d {display index} {display value}\nReplace {display index} with the numerical index of the display as shown when printing the brightness value.

This worked flawlessly until some of the Macs were upgraded to macOS Sierra, when we were suddenly unable to connect to one of the SMB shares using the server's IP address.\nThere are three Windows servers that the Macs need to connect to on login - one with IP address 192.168.65.3, one with IP address 192.168.65.30, and the final one with IP address 192.168.65.25 (this one connects using Acronis Access Connect and AFP).\nThe first SMB share from 192.168.65.3 connects successfully with no issues, then when attempting to connect to the second SMB share - 192.168.65.30 - the Mac fails to connect. Finally the Macs completes the login script by connecting successfully to the AFP share - 192.168.65.25.\nWhat I've Done\nI have discovered that there is no issue when attempting to connect to the hostname of the second SMB server - server2. Using the connection string smb://server2/share_name works perfectly where smb://192.168.65.30/share_name doesn't work at all. \nNext I attempted to capture the packets using Wireshark - I set the filter to ip.src == 192.168.65.30 or ip.dst == 192.168.65.30 but when I attempted to connect to the share there were no packets that were sent from/to that IP address. \nSo I removed the filter and tried to connect again - I could see that there were packets being sent to the network address 192.168.65.255 to resolve the IP address 192.168.65.30 to a hostname using the NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) instead of treating it as an IP address. When it failed to resolve the IP to another IP, the process of connecting failed.\nTLDR\nSierra thinks an IP address is actually a hostname during SMB connection and is attempting to resolve it to an IP address, which is obviously unsuccessful. It doesn't treat all IP addresses this way as another IP on the same subnet connects successfully.\nThis occurs on all Macs that are upgraded to Sierra.\nSo...\nWhy is macOS treating this IP address as a hostname? Is there a way I can force it to treat it as a normal IP address?\nUpdate\nI've noticed that after a while (maybe 10 minutes?) of the machines being on and logged in, it will actually connect successfully to the IP address that has been causing issues.\nUpdate 2\nSo - I have noticed that I am able to connect to the second IP address - 192.168.65.30 - if I am currently not connected to the first IP address - 192.168.65.3 - and vice-versa.\nOn the second connection it attempts to connect to the share name on the first server that was connected to. For example, if I connect to smb://192.168.65.3/share_1 first then attempt to connect to smb://192.168.65.30/share_2, the packets say that it actually attempts to connect to smb://192.168.65.3/share_2, which doesn't exist, and hence the connection fails to be established.\nIn fact, I've found that any second SMB connection attempt fails! This is reproducible by upgrading to Sierra and then just attempting to connect to two different SMB shares.\nUpdate 3\nThe name resolution was a red herring - I now know this issue to be related to opening a connection to a second SMB server. Sierra will attempt to use the same IP address it used for the first connection, and the share name specified in the second connection. A workaround would be to use the hostname, however there are issues associated with this for us when connecting from outside the office using VPN.\n\nA: This may be a reverse lookup - an attempt to resolve host name by IP. Please check the opcode... Mac may need this to display host name rather than its IP. Not sure about Sierra, but Win clients, as well as some other clients (like NQ, for example) do this. If server does not answer Mac may postpone or even fail the connect. \n", "Q: OS X 10.11.6 Missing over 200GB of disk space I have a problem with disk space - all programs report that I used up 470GB out of 512GB, but all my files take about 245GB.

I don't want to pull the power or set a scheduled time - just be able to accelerate the shutdown without using a mouse or trackpad.\nIs this possible by using some pre-arranged combination of keyboard commands or shortcuts?\n\nA: Alternatively to the proposed Terminal commands, you can make your own shortcut key commands, that will work system-wide to shut down or restart your Mac\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\nAdd new commands to All Applications for Restart… & Shut Down…\nNote that those are ellipses, not 3 full stops [periods].\n3 stops will not work.\nCopy/paste them from here if you're not sure how to make them.  \nChoose any key commands you like, but make sure they don't conflict with anything else.\n\nThe slightly odd thing is that once you've done it, the menu itself 'grows' another two commands, without ellipses.\n\nThis doesn't appear to affect anything adversely, it just looks odd.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect the new DELL 31.5-inch monitor (UP3216Q) at 3840x2160 to the new macbook pro (late 2016)? I don't know exactly how to match the MacBook Pro 2016 specs to this display to see if it would connect at the native resolution (full pixels) of the dell display.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-UP3216Q-Screen-Monitor/dp/B016IBVKNU\nWhere can I learn how to qualify a display with MacBook Pro 2016?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible, as the display supports DisplayPort 1.2 which is sufficient to drive 4K resolution at 60 Hz. Many vendors will sell appropriate adapters, though. I recommend you get a USB-C (or Thunderbolt 3) to DisplayPort adapter, like this one. You could also use Apple's USB-C to HDMI adapter, but that one only supports 30Hz at 4K resolutions.\nThe Dell has these ports:\n\n\n*\n\n*DP, mDP, HDMI (MHL), 4 x USB3 with one charging port, 1 x USB3 upstream, Media Card Reader\n\n\nApple has a very nice article covering all the implications of USB-C and Thunderbolt including links to what displays they know work at 60 Hz and 4k resolution. You will want to read that carefully as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207256\n", "Q: iTunes 12.5+ plist setting for View As -> Songs by default? I find the the default view of songs to \"Songs\" too white and it's irritating / abominable to view Playlist that way. It does't show enough details for my taste so I'd rather see something else than the current default view (Playlist):\n\nInstead, I would like to see content directly as the Songs view instead:\n\nDoes anyone know of a plist setting (in com.apple.iTunes.plist) to change the default view of songs to \"Songs\" instead of the Playlist setting?  \n\nA: I don't know how to change the default view mode for new playlists, but you can run a script like this in Script Editor to change the view mode of all existing playlists:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    user playlists whose special kind is none and smart is false\n    repeat with p in result\n        set view of browser window 1 to p\n        tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"iTunes\"\n            click menu item \"Songs\" of menu 1 of menu item \"View As\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"View\" of menu bar 1\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nI use a script like the one below to create most new playlists.

(-1719).\n\nA: Another useful option is to set up a keyboard shortcut through System Preferences (⌘S is available).\nSince the menu item \"Songs\" is used in multiple places, you have to use the full menu path when setting up the shortcut: View->View As->Songs\n", "Q: Is it possible to block specific websites and only those sites on iOS? I'd like to block just 4 specific websites but AFAICT there is no such option.\nThere's the option to \"Limit Adult Content\" but sadly it blocks way too much. For example it blocks stackexchange.com. I searched for restaurants on Google it blocked every single result. There's the option to only allow a whitelist of sites but that's not useful for me either. I'd have to add every result and every link I click on.\nEffectively I'm looking for a blacklist option. Is there a way to do it? Maybe install a custom network profile or something?\nUpdate #1\nWell so profiles don't solve it. They just do the enable the same features as available from the settings.\nNext thing is to look for passthru VPN software or something like that\n\nA: Yes, this is possible with the use of restrictions. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Tap on General\n\n*Tap on Restrictions\n\n*Tap on Enable Restrictions\n\n*Enter a restriction passcode\n\n*Swipe up until you see the Allowed Content section\n\n*Tap on Websites at bottom of the list\n\n*Tap on Limit Adult Content\n\n*This provides access to the Never Allow list\n\n*Tap on the Add a Website... option located under Never Allow\n\n*Add the four websites you want to block\n\n*Exit Restrictions / Settings\n\n\nNow these four websites will be blocked even though they may not be Adult content.\n", "Q: Why won't my MacBook work with my Raspberry Pi WiFi? I have my Raspberry Pi setup as a WiFi router, which works great! Except for one problem, my MacBook.\nConnecting through my Galaxy Tab 3 Note? A-OK. Alcatel cellphone? A-OK. Chromebook? Sure thing.\nEven my Roku 2, no problem.\nBut my MacBook? It connects to the WiFi no problem. I can even run a python -m SimpleHTTPServer on it and connect to the server via http://172.16.1.1:8000 and that works just fine. But if I try to ping 8.8.8.8? Well, that's where we start running into issues.\nI actually tried running tcpdump on my Raspberry when I started pinging 8.8.8.8 from my MacBook, but none of the ping packets showed up. I just tried pinging from a different device and packets definitely showed up.\nThere definitely was traffic from the Mac - a lot of UDP traffic, some TCP. Most of the TCP packets from my MacBook were retransmissions. There were some packets that were routed back to the IP. Here are a couple of the IPs:\nUDP:\n\n\n*\n\n*65.55.223.48,21,17\n\n*64.4.23.170,148,142\n\n*50.242.151.22\n\n*37.59.40.88\n\n*208.64.201.169\n\n*162.254.199.136\nTCP: (only these two IPs sent any TCP packets back)\n\n\n*\n\n*65.55.223.37\n\n*208.64.201.169\nSo for some reason it appears that my Mac, and only my Mac, isn't doing something right. Any clue what could be causing the connection to fail?\nUpdate:\nIt definitely looks like a DNS issue - Google Chrome provides an error DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET. Also, I can do telnet 216.58.218.206 80, and then interestingly enough it waits and waits and waits, but then it connects. After which\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: google.com\nContent-Accept: */*\n\nReturns with the Google 301 redirect to http://www.google.com\n\nA: It looks like something was horked up with my routing table. Flushing my routes with\n$ sudo route -n flush\n\nat the terminal several times, clearing my custom DNS entries, and turning my wifi off and then on again allows me to connect properly.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use mini jack to lightning adapter for input? As now new iPhones are shipping with a mini jack to lightning adapter and AFAIK lightning connector should be super-programable, is it possible to get audio input from a mini jack plugged into adapter? In other words if I take a radio, and I pug a male-male mini jack into a headphones port, can I record the audio on my iPhone?\n\nA: No, unless you use a special adapter, the audio from the radio will be send over the audio output channel of the 2.5mm headphone jack, not the input channel. This means that your radio does not function as a microphone/aux input and you can't record the audio from the radio.\n\nA: Unfortunately this is not possible.\nThe adapter uses a DAC (digital to analog converter) to convert the digital audio signal coming from the iPhone to an electrical signal that can be passed to the headphones.\nThe DAC only works in one direction. For the other direction (record into the iPhone using a microphone) you'd need an ADC (analog to digital converter.\n", "Q: Set default mail client in macOS without adding an email account? I'm on OS X el Capitan (10.11.6).\nI use Outlook to access my email and would like outlook to be the default mail application. All the instructions I find online suggest that I should open mail and choose \"Mail -> Preferences\" to set the default mail app.\nUnfortunately, Preferences is greyed out until an account is added. I don't have another account that I want to add to my Mac.\n\nHow can I set the default mail client to Outlook without adding an account to the mail client?\n\nA: Update: Seems like Microsoft finally removed this tool. The suggested solution in their support documentation is\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-an-account-as-the-default-in-outlook-for-mac-1a085d36-db97-4230-9a40-c332364426e0\nI finally found something easy that worked, the SetDefaultMailApp from Microsoft:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/troubleshoot/outlook-for-mac/useful-tools#setdefaultmailapp\n\nA: Pre-Catalina\nThe simplest way to do this - which doesn't involve messing with Mail itself - is the old faithful RCDefaultApp\nPost-Catalina\nRCDefaultApp no longer works on modern macOS.\nThe new kid on the block is SwiftDefaultApps\n\nThis Preference pane is chiefly intended to be a modern replacement for the amazing RCDefaultApp developed way back when by Carl Lindberg, which stopped working in 10.12 due to deprecation of ObjC Garbage collection.\n\n\nIt installs as a control panel from where you can set defaults for just about anything on the machine... including Mail.\nSimply select from a drop menu\n\nOld version, for pre-Catalina...\n\nIf you want to have a poke at the other sections, note it can take some time to build the apps/services list; don't think it's hung, it's just thinking ;-)\n\nA: The easiest solution is to use MSFT Mail Changer app for Mac.\nYou can download it from the page at this link.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/troubleshoot/outlook-for-mac/useful-tools#setdefaultmailapp\nJust download the .app file, no install, it gives you a list of registered mail clients, you pick one and done.\nMy company security (JAMF policy) blocks access to even open apple mail but didn't make this change so none of the share file commands from Word, Excel, or PPT would work. This app does the trick.\n\nA: You can use the system-installed Python interpreter to quickly change the default mail app.\nCopy/paste the following command into Terminal, replacing com.microsoft.Outlook with the application bundle identifier for your mail app.  Outlook's bundle identifier is com.microsoft.Outlook.\n/usr/bin/python2.7 <<EOF\nimport LaunchServices;\nresult = LaunchServices.LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(\n    \"mailto\",\n    \"com.microsoft.Outlook\")\nprint(\"Result: %d (%s)\" % (\n    result,\n    \"Success\" if result == 0 else \"Error\"))\nEOF\n\nIf you're not sure what the bundle identifier is for your mail app, run osascript -e 'id of app \"Some App Name\"' to find it.  For example, osascript -e 'id of app \"Mail\"' returns com.apple.mail.\n\nA: If you don't want to install any third-party apps, one solution is to just add a junk mail account:\n\nIt will first try to connect for about a minute and fail. But afterwards you can click on \"Sign in\" again and it will close the accounts dialog, allowing you to change the Preferences.\n\nA: SwiftDefaultApps seems to have superceded RCDefaultApp, which stopped working due to OSX changes, and the domain is down too.\nbrew install --cask swiftdefaultappsprefpane\n\n\nA: I know it's an old question, but I needed to do the same, possibly from command-line, and I found a solution.\nYou will need Homebrew, which can be installed with:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nThen, you will need duti, which is available through Brew:\nbrew install duti\n\nNow, we need to find out the name of the mail application you want to set as default, we can do that running the following command (change Airmail with your desired mail client):\nmdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier -r /Applications/Airmail\\ 3.app\n# this will return \"it.bloop.airmail2\"\n\nNow, we can set our desired app as default mail client with:\nduti -s it.bloop.airmail2 mailto\n\nThat's it!\n\nA: Sometimes, even after setting Outlook as default mail client in Apple Mail - with an account you remove afterwards - (how could Apple ever think this is a good place to stick this setting) it does not stick.\nJust to be sure, after setting the pref in Mail, run this through Terminal:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/\\\n  LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -all local,system,user\n\n\nA: This was funky for me, but I had to modify a code block noted above.  Steps I had to take to make this work (hoping it helps someone)\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n\n*Install launchservices newest module\n\n\n*Switch to Python (this is for 3+ due to launch services being I had to modify for CoreServices)\nimport CoreServices;\nresult = CoreServices.LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(\n    \"mailto\",\n    \"com.microsoft.Outlook\")\nprint(\"Result: %d (%s)\" % (\n    result,\n    \"Success\" if result == 0 else \"Error\"))\nEOF```\n\n\n\n\n*Reboot\n\n\n*Open Mail.app and use all my Exchange info (tried using a bogus email/comp but it still tries to auth even when you use an \"other mail option\")\n\n\n*In Preferences > General tab there's a default mail client, update to Outlook.\n(I tested mailto on the Mail app to ensure it registered.  When it did I went ahead and swapped to Outlook)\n\n\n*Test mailto\n\nA: This answer works without any third party software.\nSolution tested on MacOS 12.6.1.\nPlace the code below in a Swift file.\nReplace the mailApp url with the path to your preferred mail application.\n// DefaultMailSwitcher.swift\nimport Cocoa\nlet mailApp = URL(fileURLWithPath: \"/Applications/Microsoft Outlook.app\")\nNSWorkspace.shared.setDefaultApplication(at: mailApp, toOpenURLsWithScheme: \"mailto\")\n\nThen run from terminal with administrative privileges, without admin the command will silently fail even with a closure.\n$ sudo swift DefaultMailSwitcher.swift\n\nConfirm programmatically by running the code below from another swift file or clicking a \"mailto\" link.\nprint(\"After: \",NSWorkspace.shared.urlForApplication(toOpen: URL(string: \"mailto:me@example.com\")!))\n\n\nA: Sometimes the easiest solutions stare us in the face and it's easy to overlook them. I get asked this regularly and the easiest way to do this is to just set up Apple Mail with your email account and then change the default email application to Outlook. \nYou don't have to use Apple Mail again after that. So, while you're technically still adding an account to Mail, you don't have to use it, or you can remove it after you've set the default to Outlook.\nEDIT\nI just wanted to add that in some cases, certain Apple software (e.g. Photos) have their own settings for which email client to use when sharing content. So you will need to select Outlook as the default within these Apps as well if you want to share content via email.\n", "Q: Wifi audio extender I need to replace an old airport express which I use purely to get audio from my computer over to where my stereo system is.

I assume there's either a way to do in the System Preferences or I have to set a value to some variable in Terminal.\nI've been researching for it for a while, but I couldn't solve it myself. Please tell me how I can set it.\n\n(Operating system: macOS Sierra Version 10.12.1)\n\nA: Just in case you weren't aware and/or haven't tried this, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*click on the battery icon in the menu bar\n\n*in the dropdown menu that appears, click \"Show\" \n\n*select whether you want the remaining time or percentage displayed\n\n\nThis will display the remaing time or remaining percentage to the right of the battery icon. It is always visible in the menu bar, making it easy to glance at regularly.\nWith regard the warning, I'm a little surprised it's only triggering at 5%. However, it is designed to trigger once your MacBook is running on reserve power and perhaps in your case that's at 5% because of the overall battery life.\n", "Q: Wrong keycode on macOS. How to fix?

Some possible fixes are at\nhttp://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2009/12/fixing-keyboard-type-problems.html\n\nA: I just could resolve it using a third app: Karabiner\nYou need to download Karabiner Elements, this version supports the Sierra, if you go to the website, the Karabiner software doesn't.\nAfter installing it, you need to look in the readme for this section: \n\nChange section key § with accent key `\n\nApply the configuration and everything will work again! \n", "Q: MacBook taking a long time to wake from sleep after Sierra Retina MacBook Pro takes a long time to wake from sleep, MacBook Pro: long time to wake from sleep, what could it be?, and Takes a long time for my macbook pro to wake from sleep do not answer my question.\nI have experienced multiple slow-downs of waking from sleep on my MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2016) running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2555).\nThis is the usual dock I have. It's pretty much the default, but I always have Terminal, Discord Canary, TextEdit, and Google Chrome open.\n\nIn case this is relevant, I recently changed my settings to never sleep on a timer. It only sleeps when the lid of my MacBook is shut.\nAnyways, now we can get into the actual problem. My screen turns on, but doesn't have any content. After about 40 seconds, my MacBook is usable.\n\nA: Have you tried resetting your System Management Controller?\nTo do this on your MacBook, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer (a full shut down, not just logging out)\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nIf that doesn't help you could also reset your NVRAM as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine (a full shut down, not just logging out)\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\n\nA: I just improved my sleep/wake in Mojave via the System Preferences > Energy Savings screen:\n\nMy computer which is absolutely not resource-starved was taking a long time, like 5-10 sec to wake up on keypress after sleeping for any amount of time.\nI found both Computer sleep and Display sleep were set to 15 mins, so I changed display sleep to 1 min and noticed the login screen appeared significantly faster after I let the computer sleep for a couple minutes.\nI am now running display sleep at 15 mins and computer sleep at 30 mins. This means when I go grab a coffee and return, I can resume usage faster. If I find this still-annoying, I will crank Computer sleep up to 60 mins. That should allow me to drive to the store and return without suffering the long wake-time.\nNote: there is also the Put hard disks to sleep when possible setting, which I haven't tested, but if a person wants to totally disregard energy savings, unchecking that and setting computer sleep to never should give you the fastest wake speed.\n", "Q: How can i extend my partition further than the limit?

It did not come with any install or recovery disks.  This is my first purchase of a Apple device since my old iPod that broke, so please bear with me.\nI knew right away that the hard drive was shot, so I followed the iFixIt tutorial to replace the hard drive with a new, 40GB IDE HDD. So this hard drive is brand new and not formatted to an OS X Extended partition, which may be part of the problem.\nI burned an install CD from this website which hosts old version of MacOSX.  Everything boots up correctly, by holding the C key down when turning on the computer. I get to the installer wizard, and I get all the way to the 'Select Destination' part of the install, and this is where I get stuck.\nThe installer doesn't show a hard drive partition, so I can't install it anywhere.  I know that I need to format the hard drive, but I didn't have the tools to mount it on my Windows machine to pre-format it before putting it in the computer.  I burned a live-cd of Ubuntu 12.04 for PowerPC architecture, and tried to boot to an environment to format the hard drive, but I can't get past a couple kernel panics that I'm encountering (not sure if it's a bad CD burn or Ubuntu not liking the computer...).\nSo, my question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I format this new HDD to OS X Extended?\n\n\nOther sources say to just open the terminal from the installer and use fdisk, but I don't see a way to do that, closing the installer window just restarts the computer, and there are no other programs to run.\n\n\nA: So, as it turns out OS X 10.1 DOES come with Disk Utility, but you need to access it BEFORE you start the installer!  If you start the installer and move past the Introduction section, you cannot get back to the Disk Utility, you have to restart the computer!\nSo, to format my new hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted up with the OS X 10.1 CD in the CD-ROM drive, held C to boot to the CD\n\n*After first load, BEFORE selecting a language in the dialog\n\n*Go to Installer > Open Disk Utility... in the menu bar at the top\n\n*It found my new HDD in the side menu\n\n*Erase and partition it from the separate tabs\n\n*Close the Disk Utility and go back to the installer wizard\n\n\nYour HDD should now show up under the Select a Destination menu in the wizard!\nThe YouTube video of the installer that klanomath posted was a huge help.

Boot Camp Assistant has already created the flash drive for installation and the partition on my hard drive. I restarted and booted into the Windows installer. \nThe partition created by the BCA gives an error in the Installer saying the selected disk has an MBR partition table, and that on EFI systems, Windows needs to be installed on a GPT disk. \nWell, searching on the internet I came across this forum: https://superuser.com/questions/508026/windows-detects-gpt-disk-as-mbr-in-efi-boot .\nI completed the steps using gdisk in Terminal. Now, when I boot into the Windows Installer, it just sits there, not loading. And eventually, the flash drive goes inactive.\nWhat am I doing wrong? How do I get past the partition error?\n\nA: If you changed the file within Boot Camp that allowed you to install from a USB on an older version of the Mac don't bother, it won't work.\nIf this problem persists just burn the ISO to a blank disc. I used a DVD-R. Then install it from the disc. I recommend restoring the partition to a single partition and uninstall windows with the BCA and try again this time with a disc that has enough space for the ISO.\nThe gdisk solution in some cases will help for other individuals but for your case I believe you have an old Mac.\n", "Q: Very quiet audio output under Windows 10 (Late 2016 MacBook Pro) After installing Windows 10 with Boot Camp Assistant for my Late-2016 15\" MacBook Pro, I'm finding maximum volume to be almost inaudibly quiet under nearly all uses. The audio is deafeningly loud at full volume under macOS, so something is definitely wrong \nWindows shows the volume is maxed. Nothing obvious in control panel. The driver is apparently \"Cirrius\", but I know nothing about it. \nSearching around yields a lot of similar complaints from 2009, and advice to install Realtek drivers, but that's so out of date I don't suspect I should risk it. Any ideas?\n\nA: I have the same problem on a MacBook Air with the Cirrius drivers. I managed to get the volume to boost a little by checking the \"disable all enhancements\" box on the sound properties (as some online had suggested from a few years back), but still no where near as load as it gets on a Mac. It is certainly a driver issue but so far I've yet to find a fixed driver.\n\nA: I had this issue... Solved by booting into MacOS and turning volume all the way up... then plug in headphones and turn volume all the way up... It was set to like %10 volume.\nThe windows driver doesn't access the chip's volume properly.\n\nA: I did everything listed above and none worked.\nThis one did the trick.\nIn windows 10:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the volume icon in the task tray, and choose Open Volume Mixer.\n\n*Click device speakers\n\n*Spatial Sound\n\n*Windows Sonic for headphones.\n\n\nI dont know why but now my imac with windows 10 has max volume.\n\nA: I experienced this problem the last few days in Windows 10 (using Bootcamp) on my 15\" MacBook Pro when playing videos through the built in speakers. To fix it, this worked for me:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the volume icon in the task tray, and choose Open Sound Settings.  \n\n*Scroll down to Related Settings and click on Sound control panel.  \n\n*Scroll down and select Speakers, and then click Configure.  \n\n*Change Quadraphonic to Stereo and back to Quadraphonic again.\n(I actually Tested the sound for Stereo before changing it back again, but not sure if that's required).  \n\n*Hit Test and the sound should come blaring out!  \n\n*Hit Next, then Next again, and then Finish to end the wizard leaving the defaults in place.  \n\n*Click Ok in the Sound control panel window.  \n\n\nYou're hopefully working now!\n\nA: Just go to Device manager (Right click on This PC > Manage, Expand sound, video and game controllers, Find Cirrus Logic drive, go to Properties, Disable this driver, then restart PC, and after that go to the device manager again and Enable this driver.

So, I did the steps above, and in the last tab named \"Spatial Sound\" I disabled it. \nNow the sound seens like in the MacOS.\n\nA: I also had this issue until I looked into the Speakers Properties > Advanced tab and saw that it was set to a 24 bit quality, changed it to my macOS default (32 bit 44100Hz) and it ran just like on macOS\n\nA: I installed win 10 on a dell optiplex, low sound on headphones, tried all the adjustments, (another dell was OK though, it can be individual PCs), anyway I solved it by using a usb sound card from ebay £ 3 -4,  it has mike and headphone jacks, and sound is back to normal...it might also work if you got usb headphones but not tried yet...\n\nA: Here's what I did~\nPlayback Devices -> Cirrus Logic CS4208 -> Properties\nTab: Levels - Make sure they are at 100.\nTab: Enhancements -\nTurn on Loudness Equalization then open settings for that option and set the release to long.\nThis made Netflix max volume substantially louder. \n\nA: I solved it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the volume icon in the task tray, and choose Open Sound Settings.\n\n*Under Cirrus click on \"device properties\"\n\n*Click on Enhancements\n\n*Check on low frequency, Speaker fill, loudness equalization\n\n\nSolved! \n\nA: This has nothing to do with the Driver. You simply go back into MacOS and you will find that your volume was low or not set to full. This limits the volume in windows to whatever the volume was in MacOS.\nFix. Go back into MacOS. Set Volume to 100. Restart and go into windows. 100 volume in windows is now the same as 100 volume in MacOS.\n\nA: SOLVED. Set Loudness Equalization to Short. Here's how -\nGo to speaker settings.\nSelect 'Enhancements' tab.\nCheck 'Bass Boost' AND 'Loudness Equalization'.\nThe most important part, with Loudness Equalization selected, click on the Settings button just below it.

I find it Good for movies, Drawbacks are that it will reduce audio instead of increasing it for some situations. Not good for music.\n\n\n*Spatial sound - didn't work on mine, I don't know.\nExplanation\nfirst and most obvious issue - Unlike on macOS where the setup is treated as a 2.2 Channel, it's treated as a 4 channel (we selected \"Quadrophonic\", if you selected stereo it will give a 2.0 Channel).\nin macOS, the lows and low-mids are divided well towards the subwoofer while the highs and high-mids are played through the tweeters.\nin Windows, the highs, mids, and lows are played through the subwoofer. while the tweeters give a light high sound (because it can't produce low sounds)\nThe reason for this is half-baked drivers from apple.

I realise this is not purely a Mac specific question, but I can't find the answer elsewhere. \nBasically I need to free up disk space on my Mac, and want to work with files stored on the USB drive. Is this acceptable practice or is it better practice to keep the files I wish to work on stored on the Mac's internal drive, and then only use the USB drive for storing files and backing up? \nThe most common files I work with are large resolution photographs, and the software I use most is Photoshop CC.\n\nA: The answer to your question depends on your setup, how you've configured Photoshop, and the actual external drive.\nTypically one would have Photoshop configured to use the internal drive for its scratch disk location, so in that sense you won't overly slow your work down.\nHowever, it's highly likely that you'll notice read/write speeds to be slower when saving and opening files from the external drive, although how much will depend on the actual drive and what you have installed as an internal drive. \nFor example, if your internal drive is an SSD the difference will be quite noticeable, especially with larger files. However, if your internal drive is only a 5400rpm drive you probably won't notice any difference. And of course it'll be somewhere in between for 7200rpm drives or fusion/hybrid drives.\nRegardless of what you do, make sure you have a backup regime in place. So if you use the external for your Photoshop work, then invest in another drive for Time Machine (or other) backups!\nSome tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*the more RAM you have, the better. Make sure your Photoshop preferences allow as much memory as possible.\n\n*make sure you have a reasonable amount of free space on your internal drive, not only for scratch disk purposes, but also for virtual memory usage.\n\n*you can work with a few files off your external USB as a test before moving everything across \n\n*once again, make sure you have a backup regime in place!\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro fan is not running on default settings regardless of how hot it gets I have a MacBook Pro (Retina) and I am noticing that the fan is not running at all even though the temperature gets to more than 60c and the system starts lagging.

Can I connect two external monitors to my 12\" Retina MacBook (early-2015)\nHow do I do it and can it be VGA or only HDMI\n\nA: This MacBook can simultaneously support the internal display as well as up to 3840x2160 at 30 Hz or up to 4096x2160 at 24Hz on one external display. \nIn other words, connecting two external Thunderbolt Displays is not officially supported by Apple. The two displays are the internal display and an external display.\nIf you're still interested in connecting one external display, since this MacBook has a single USB-C port and no traditional video port, you'll need an adapter to connect the display.

So I decided to retry, which meant I needed to delete the Debian partition. When I tried to in Disk Utility, it gave me errors, so I booted into internet recovery mode and removed the partitions there. I then proceeded in clicking the Apple Logo and selecting the choose boot partition thing. It showed nothing. At first I panicked, thinking I had somehow deleted all of my data. I tried creating a second partition, so I could install Mac OS there and then fix my mac from there. I clicked on the create partition, waited 3ish hours while I went out, came back and it said preparing to partition. So I rebooted and saw that the partition type was: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFF. So I installed Mac OS X onto a painfully slow flash drive (15-20MB/s) and then looked up my problem. I found other solution people had created only they were specific to the exact case.

Sorry titled this one badly, I'm assuming power is the two centre pins, then data is the rest, but surely it's messed up when the cable is plugged in backwards?\n\nA: Per this site:\n\n\nApple Lightning interface is adaptive - the controller chip dynamically assign pins function according to plugged device.\nThe Apple Lightning connector plug can be inserted with either side\n  facing up (the processor inside the plug detects the plug's\n  orientation and routes the electrical signals to the correct pins).Two\n  differential pair lanes (L0p/n and L1p/n) may swap in IC of device\n  connector (lanes don't swap if accessory identification chip connect\n  to ID0 pin).\n\n\n\nA: From: Systems Analysis of the Apple Lightning to USB Cable \n\nThe BQ2025’s one data pin is connected to two Lightning cable pins.\n  Why two? Recall that the Lightning cable is designed to work no matter\n  which way it is inserted into the phone (USB anyone?). Some may call\n  it lazy to not have to think when plugging something in, but we feel\n  that it is a subtle improvement in usability that shows attention to\n  detail.\nThe figure below shows the Lightning cable in two orientations\n  (there’s a little white triangle on the diagram to help you visualize\n  the rotation). The coloured lines indicate electrically equivalent\n  pins. We know from our circuit board analysis that the BQ2025 connects\n  to the black signal. Effectively then, the BQ2025 is connected to two\n  Lightning cable pins. We’ve labelled them A1 and B5.\nThe phone itself only monitors the bottom row of pins. If the user has\n  inserted the cable right-side-up, the phone needs to use the pin,\n  which is fifth from the left, to communicate with the BQ2025. That’s\n  where the black signal is. Furthermore, if the user has inserted the\n  cable upside-down (or is it right-side-up?), the phone needs to use\n  the left-most pin. The BQ2025’s one data pin is connected to two\n  Lightning cable pins. Why two? Recall that the Lightning cable is\n  designed to work no matter which way it is inserted into the phone\n  (USB anyone?).

Can I get rid of some of them?\n\nA: The icon is for Keychain Access. You can enable and disable the icon (usually there's only one) from the Keychain Access app's preferences. Try toggling this checkbox and seeing what happens.\nMultiple icons is sometimes a rare glitch where other menu bar items appear with the wrong icon, taking on the appearance of a different item. This can usually be fixed by killing SystemUIServer (killall -HUP SystemUIServer).\nIf it really is multiple menu bar items, you can remove them by ⌘-dragging them away from the menu bar.\n", "Q: Keynote: How to skip \"open presentation\" window?

Is it possible to use an iPhone in a way that can be encrypted and accessed by both iOS and any unix based OS as an external  drive? Even if additional software or tinkering is necessary in either system.\nReasoning is that I always carry it with me and it seems a much more secure alternative to uploading sensitive files to Dropbox so I can access them by the phone and any other computer.\n\n~~I will be cross-posting this question to several other subject related stack communities in the hopes to obtain a good answer. I haven't been around here for a while; let me know if this is not kosher and I'll remove them~~ Edit: I've been advised against this, so moot now.\n\nA: The short answer is, yes. There are a huge number of file manager apps out there. The trick is to find one which is (a) secure and (b) provides a webdav server so you can access the files on the device from other machines on the network (via a web browser or other webdav client).\nI use Files by Olive Toast, which certainly fits your second criterion. Another one which looks like it would is EZ Server by Lisa Burns.\nRegarding security, it depends what you're looking for. Do you want the files stored in encrypted storage on your iOS device? That's how iOS works for everything. Do you want them protected by a password? Isn't your iOS passcode enough? Do you want the webdav server to support https? Probably only necessary if you're using public Wi-Fi networks.\n", "Q: After Changing Partition Type From FFFF I Can't Boot I originally asked the following question: Partition Type: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF Macbook Pro about how to change my partition type from an unknown to a normal one, since it was unmountable. \nI was able to and I can now view all of my files, however I cannot boot from it.

So  I tried to reinstall the latest version of Mac OS Sierra, until the installer said \"This disk cannot be used to start up your computer.\"\nHere is all of my info: \nsh-3.2# cd /Volumes/Internal/\nsh-3.2# ls -la\ntotal 72\n      2 drwxr-xr-x   35 root          wheel   1258 Nov  6 22:02 .\n  13744 drwxrwxrwt@   5 root          admin    170 Nov 22 11:55 ..\n3976587 -rw-rw-r--    1 root          admin  15364 Nov 22 10:53 .DS_Store\n 448963 d--x--x--x   10 root          wheel    340 Nov 22 11:52 .DocumentRevisions-V100\n4414129 -rw-r--r--    1 root          wheel    591 Nov  6 22:01 .OSInstallerMessages\n 458404 drwxr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov 20 16:57 .PKInstallSandboxManager-SystemSoftware\n     20 drwx------    5 root          admin    170 Oct  8 13:08 .Spotlight-V100\n 498780 d-wx-wx-wt    3 root          wheel    102 Oct  8 18:29 .TemporaryItems\n     26 d-wx-wx-wt@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov 22 11:52 .Trashes\n3976588 ----------    1 root          admin      0 Jul 30 14:32 .file\n     24 drwx------   11 root          admin    374 Nov 22 11:52 .fseventsd\n3976589 drwxr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov  6 21:57 .vol\n3976590 drwxrwxr-x+ 141 root          admin   4794 Nov 20 18:44 Applications\n2719236 drwxr-xr-x    4 root          wheel    136 Oct 29 12:18 EFI\n4051944 drwxr-xr-x+  63 root          wheel   2142 Nov 12 12:19 Library\n4082330 drwxr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov  6 21:57 Network\n3976557 drwxr-xr-x@   4 root          wheel    136 Nov  6 21:53 System\n1961160 drwxrwxrwx@  13 Thoughtyness  staff    442 Oct 16 01:28 Twixtor5\n1962231 drwxrwxrwx@   9 Thoughtyness  staff    306 Oct 16 01:28 Twixtor5AEManual\n 412912 drwxr-xr-x    6 root          admin    204 Nov  6 22:02 Users\n 412916 drwxr-xr-x@   4 root          wheel    136 Nov 20 20:58 Volumes\n4394376 drwxr-xr-x@  38 root          wheel   1292 Oct 21 04:07 bin\n4394413 drwxrwxr-t@   2 root          admin     68 Nov  6 21:57 cores\n4394414 dr-xr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov  6 21:57 dev\n4394415 lrwxr-xr-x@   1 root          wheel     11 Nov  6 21:56 etc -> private/etc\n4415298 dr-xr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov  6 22:02 home\n4394416 -rw-r--r--@   1 root          wheel    313 Sep 23 19:18 installer.failurerequests\n 434287 dr-xr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Oct  8 13:44 net\n3976539 drwxr-xr-x@   6 root          wheel    204 Nov  6 21:57 private\n4395069 drwxr-xr-x@  63 root          wheel   2142 Nov  6 21:56 sbin\n4395131 lrwxr-xr-x@   1 root          wheel     11 Nov  6 21:56 tmp -> private/tmp\n4395132 drwxr-xr-x@  10 root          wheel    340 Nov  6 22:00 usr\n4413886 lrwxr-xr-x@   1 root          wheel     11 Nov  6 21:56 var -> private/var\n\nsh-3.2# diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI NO NAME                 209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         450.1 GB   disk0s2\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Internal               *449.7 GB   disk1\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *31.4 GB    disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Fixer OS                30.5 GB    disk2s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk2s3\n\nsh-3.2# gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part -

I received my new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar today and quickly realized that the shortcut ctrl+alt+cmd+power (documented here under 'Sleep, log out, and shut down shortcuts') no longer works for quitting all apps followed by shutting down.\nCan this shortcut be reinstated or is it replaced by something similar?\n\nA: \"Have you tried using TOUCH ID as a substitute for Power Button in the regular shortcuts?\"\nholding down Touch ID will power off the computer, but it's a hard poweroff similar to holding down the power button on older machines for 5 seconds. I also can find no method for using the keyboard to initiate a normal shutdown. Bizarrely, the TouchBar has a sleep command that can be configured (see the bit about customize and expand here), but using modifier keys with the Touchbar sleep command like cmd or cmd-opt or cmd-opt-ctr will launch into the Energy Saver pane in System Preferences rather than sleep, restart or shut down..weird. Hopefully they'll add/fix this in a future software update. This is a BIG drawback for me as well in the new machine :( \n\nA: *\n\n*In System Preferences → Mission Control\n\n\n*\n\n*Change \"Show Desktop\" to F10\n\n*Change \"Show Dashboard\" to F11\n\n\n*In System Preferences → Keyboard, open App Shortcuts.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click + to add a new shortcut.\n\n*Leave Application as \"All Applications\".\n\n*In Menu Title enter exactly this phrase (without quotation marks): \"Shut Down…\"\n\n*Click cursor in the Keyboard shortcut field, then on keyboard hold \"fn\" key then select \"F12\" on Touch Bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Holding \"fn\" key and selecting \"F12\" on Touch Bar will bring up the shutdown prompt.\n\n*Holding \"fn\" key and selecting \"F10\" will show desktop, holding \"F11\" will show dashboard.\n\n\nA: I recommend to make a QuickAction-Button. If you have quickActions on your TouchBar (to activate, look at apple guide here, you can use Automator to run a AppleScript (I used this one) and insert it into the TouchBar. \nI made myself a nice red Button, as explained in detail here.\n\nA: Have you tried using TOUCH ID as a substitute for Power Button in the regular shortcuts?\nI haven't got my hands on the new MBP but an article here says\n\n...and when you want to turn it off, you just hold down the Touch ID button found at the rightmost side of the Touch Bar.\n  So technically, Touch ID is the power button.  \n\nHowever, according to iMore, TOUCH ID only offers following functionality: \n\nThe \"Use Touch ID for\" options include:\n  Unlocking your Mac\n  Apple Pay\n  iTunes & App Store\n\nSo ther is slightly less chance of Touch ID working as a power button.\nYou can let us know about it.\nAnother small workaround this situation can be using CMD+Shift+/ to open Help menu first\n\nAnd then using Direction keys (Up, Down, Left & Right) to navigate to Apple Menu, from where you can easily Sleep, Restart or Shut Down\n\n\nA: You can press down the Touch ID button just as you would a regular Power button.\nAnd thus the Control + Command + Touch ID does work if you hold it for 5 seconds or so.\n", "Q: Trying to make an Attachment reminder using a RegEx, but the filter doesn't work So basically, in Mail, I'm trying to set it up so that if the word \"attach\", or \"attachment\" with any casing is detected and there isn't an attachment on the e-mail, it prompts me to add an attachment to the e-mail. I have Mail Act-On as a plugin to help me add more filters onto my Mail as it comes in and out.\nI've made a RegEx in the javascript form for it to find out whenever I type the word in. I've tested it in a website and it comes back as true for the cases of words I've put in, but in Mail.app it doesn't work.\nDoes anyone have any ideas?\n\n\nA: Mail rules are only applied to new messages in the inbox, not outgoing messages. I don't believe it is possible to have such functionality in Mail natively; you would need to create or install a plugin to do this. After some searching, it looks like there is a Mail plugin which does what you're looking for called Send Companion (free, with other paid features).\nIf you're running an older version of macOS (Tiger through Snow Leopard), Attachment Scanner (free) looks like it would do the trick.\n", "Q: Kernel Panic on El Capitan Mac Book Pro Can anyone look at this crash log and tell me what's causing my kernel panic?

We distribute a non-AppStore-app to our agents in the field. Since our app is not from the App Store, it has not been reviewed by Apple.  An Apple retail store worker in Australia told one of our agents that the app is not authorized, and to stop using it or else they will void the warranty.\nCan anyone verify that the Apple device warranty is not affected at all by non App Store apps? The device isn't even jail-broken and nothing in the warranty clause talks about faulty software (that I could find). I am also certain the Apple (or retailer) employee is wrong because apps cannot break the system!\n\nA: You can't void the warranty by using non-App Store apps.  The warranty covers the hardware of the device, not the OS.\nThousands, or hundreds-of-thousands, of corporate and school users develop and use apps that are not vetted through the Apple App store.  In fact, Apple encourages this type of activity.  Their own site for enterprise development states: \n\nThe Apple Developer Enterprise Program allows you to develop proprietary, in-house iOS, and watchOS apps that you can distribute to your users in your organization and outside the store.\n\nWhat you're told by the Apple retail employee is completely wrong.\n\nA: As an enterprise developer myself I can confirm that this is not true since you need to provision its distribution profile which could only be signed thru the Apple's Developer portal and besides I've had many phones repaired by Apple that has my enterprise app and they haven't said a word about it.\n", "Q: How to install Windows 7 onto MacOS Sierra without downgrading using BootCamp?

Apple indicates that TestFlight is way to \"improve your app before submitting it to the App Store for review.\"\nHowever, Twitter and developer forums are full of examples of apps that passed TestFlight and failed App Store review.

Is there a possible fix?\n\nA: EDIT I thought I figured it out, but I tested with DuckDuckGo and it does not redirect you to a different domain. Yet the problem still occurs on that site. So the mystery continues. The first workaround might still work for you if you are using Google. The second workaround should work in any case.\nI am able to reproduce this bug and have a few workarounds.\nThe reason this bug hasn't been fixed yet might be that it not always occurs when in full screen, you have to be in a different country than the U.S.A. too. It seems that the redirection to a different country domain causes this behaviour. I assume all the Safari developers reside in the U.S.A., so they never experience this behaviour.\nNow for the workarounds:\nOption 1\nIf you are using Google, visit google.com/ncr. This sets a cookie preventing redirection to a local Google site. The bug will disappear until you clear your cookies. There should be similar options for other search engines.\nIf you want it to disappear permanently or if you want to keep using your local site, we have:\nOption 2\nAdd the AnySearch extension to Safari and configure it to use your search engine of choice. The bug does not seem to occur when using this extension.\nI filed a detailed bug report with Apple btw. Hope it gets fixed in the near future.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro battery life with Android Studio 2.2 running I have a late 2013 Macbook Pro Retina 15 inch with i7 2.3 GHz, 16GB Ram, nVidia 750m 2GB and 500GB PCIe SSD. \nI've always been happy with the machine and battery life, except when I work in Android Studio (always updated to the latest version).\nI can never get past 2,5 - 3 hours of battery life. Is this normal ?\nI never run the emulator, as I always use a real device to test my apps. \nI've tried SMC and PRAM reset with no impact. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: There was a long-standing problem with Oracle JDKs/JREs causing the discrete video card rather than the integrated one to be used on Retina displays, with a consequent hit on battery life. The problem became apparent when JetBrains started bundling Oracle's JRE with IntelliJ-based IDEs (see, for instance, IDEA-119858 in their bugtracker). Android Studio is based on the IntelliJ platform so would have suffered from the same problem.\nThat said, the problem has been fixed for quite some time in JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, and issue 80173 in the Android Studio tracker says it was fixed in Android Studio 2.2. So since you say you're using the latest version perhaps your problem has another cause, or perhaps the problem's not in fact fixed in all cases. gfxCardStatus (as linked from the JetBrains bug report) might be useful in checking which card is actually being used. I used the tool for a while on my own mid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro back in the days when IntelliJ IDEA was suffering from this problem.\n", "Q: Disable `use safari suggested password` without disabling autofill Is there a way to disable \"use safari suggested password\" shown below, without disabling autofill? \n\nA: The correct answer is: there is no way to disable the suggested passwords \"feature\" without completely disabling auto-fill.\n\nA: At least as of MacOS Ventura, it is possible to selectively turn off password suggestions without completely turning off autofill:\nSafari > Settings > Passwords > Autofill > [unselect \"User names and passwords\"]\n\n\nA: Safari->preferences->passwords, delete those you do not want.\n", "Q: iPhone 7, iOS 10.1.1: Missing new wallpapers I just got the new iPhone 7 and the new wallpapers which I have seen on ads and Apple's website are missing. \nHow to get them on my iPhone?\nCurrent OS: 10.1.1\nI don't want to download them from the internet because of quality issue.\nNew wallpapers look like this.\n\n\nA: These wallpapers are included with iOS 10.3, which is yet to be released publicly.

If you don't use the ambient light sensor for the display, you can use some hook on the increase/decrease brightness keys to also press the backlight brightness keys at the same time, using an app such as Keyboard Maestro. Otherwise, you can use Keyboard Maestro with some loop to get the display brightness on regular intervals and set the backlight brightness appropriately.\n", "Q: Install and run Linux on partition of external HD? Is it possible to install and run Linux on a partition an external HD in OS X?\nAlmost all the instructions I've found are about installing to the entire external HD, not to a partition.\nI've install rEFInd on a Core2 Duo late 2007 iMac and dd'd a Linux .iso to a FAT-formatted partition on an external FW 800-connected drive, but the drive disappears from Finder and does not appear as an option in rEFInd when the iMac is rebooted.\nI have to change the partition format back to OSX Extended (journaled) via selecting Disk -> Partition -> click on the particular partition in OS X 10.11.6 Disk Utility, and rename it to see it again, which of course wipes out the dd'd .iso.

I'm trying to use 3 external monitors, but I can only get 2 to work. I've seen people suggest using an active cable, but all of their suggestions are for MacBooks with a dedicated graphics card. \nWill an active cable be enough for my situation, or do I have to buy some other, more expensive piece of hardware?\n\nA: Officially Apple only supports two external displays on this model.\nMore specifically, it supports an HDMI-compatible device, including 4K, while using one Thunderbolt display or it can support up to two Thunderbolt displays.\nIn terms of external resolution this model supports up to 3840 x 2160 pixels at 30Hz or 4096 x 2160 pixels at 24Hz via HDMI and up to 3840 x 2160 pixels at 60Hz via Thunderbolt.\nYou could investigate external graphics card options, but I would suggest living with the two displays instead.

I cannot be entirely sure about this but it seemed to happen this way:\nWhen the iPhone 5, 6, or 7 was out of power, I could plug it into my car's USB charger or a portable USB battery charger for 10, even 15 minutes, before the phone is willing to start up.  A 15 minute wait, can be a bit too much -- if it were 2, 3 minutes, it would be more tolerable, but a good 15 minute, is too much.\nBut I noticed sometimes when I plug in the lightning jack for a charge, the iPhone will start immediately.\nIs it due to some charger are supplying 5W, while some are supplying 10 or 12W?\nI suspect iPhone might be doing some calculation: if possible power consumption is less than power input (10W), then be worry free and power up immediately. However, if possible power consumption is more than the input (5W), then don't power up first, accumulate first before powering up (and it turned out to be 15 minutes usually).\nDoes someone know for sure how this works?\nP.S. Decemeber 2016: So today, I tried out an iPhone 5S, and saw that it was 1%, but too late, about 1-2 seconds after I plugged it in, it turned itself off. And thinking that it was a 39W 2 port charger with QC 3.0 (an Anker charger used in the car), I thought it should start up almost immediately. Not so, it took close to 15 minutes before it turned itself on, and I didn't look what battery level it was when it started up, but 10 minutes or so after the start up, I looked, and it was at 21%. So it looked like it could have turned itself off sooner.\n\nA: Many factors - dead phone/0% battery isn't an entirely fixed point, depending on battery age/health, power requirements, temperature (winter cold...), calibration state etc it can mean anything from a calculated shutdown by the device at a level before excessive wear starts to occur, to the phone just suddenly dying at a point where there's still supposed to be juice left and it's not so much protecting itself, more like a blackout.\nDuring discharge the voltage continuously decreases, which is what the phone keeps tabs on and cuts off at a safe level, but as it loses charge the max amperage/wattage also gives way, leading to further (short) voltage drops when it overextends itself.\nAs an example, if you're running low on battery and decide to take a bunch of photos before your phone dies, the high power draw will likely mean the phone shuts off a lot sooner than if you kept it in your pocket on standby.\nBut that means that in the latter scenario... once it's dead, it'll be deader, and it will take longer to bring up to a healthy enough voltage to boot - turning on, mind you, is a lot more power intensive than just staying alive once on. If the phone tries to boot before enough power is available it will black out again.\nInput power obviously plays a large role here, just as you say, but it's not so much the phone calculating anything fancy or being tactical. Plug an iPhone with a worn-out battery into a semi-glitchy cable and it will happily bootloop for weeks on end instead of waiting and building up enough charge to actually manage to power on and chill out. \nYou're on the right track, key thing being that the brick can't power the phone directly, it's feeding the battery which feeds the phone, again a battery at low charge is flaky so even plugged in there needs to be a buffer, and once you get going that where you get the non-linear response. Say the phone needs 2W and it's getting 4W effective from a 5W brick, so 2W left to build charge. Double it to 8W and the surplus triples.\n\nA: The reason the more powerful QC 3.0 charger wasn't charging your iPhone any faster is because iPhones are not compatible with QC.  iPhones use USB-BC, USB-PD, and Apple's own BrickID for power.\nUSB-BC and QC both use the USB D+/D- pins for the power brick to advertise how much power the brick can supply.  But they do so in ways that are not compatible with each other.\nApple devices will check a USB-A port for a given set of DC voltages on the data pins, the power brick has no 2-way communications with devices.  Based on the voltages detected it will know how much current is safe to draw.  The voltages on the data pins may differ but power is always delivered at 5 volts.  USB-BC and BrickID both use this method of advertising available current with voltages on the data pins, BrickID extends this set of voltage combinations to allow advertising available power above what USB-BC specifies.\nQC uses some 2-way communication to tell a compatible device how much current it can supply, and at what voltage.  A QC device can then request a voltage between 3.6 and 22 volts, but always starts out with a USB compatible 5 volts.  If there's no communication from the device then the QC power brick stays at 5 volts.\nApple devices will assume that the power brick it is plugged into can only provide 1 amp if it can't communicate with the power brick.  That's how USB-BC was designed and QC power bricks are made to allow for this.  Since QC is using the data pins for 2-way communications it can't advertise that it is able to provide more power to devices looking for USB-BC and BrickID power bricks.\nApple iPhones can charge faster from non-Apple power bricks but only if the power brick uses USB-BC/BrickID, or the power brick uses USB-PD on a USB-C connector.  Phones using QC for power won't take more than 5 watts from a USB-BC/BrickID charger because they can't \"speak the same language\".\nI realize that given the age of the original question that at the time QC 4 was likely not on the market, at least not widely available.  QC 4 chargers may provide faster charging with iPhones by figuring out a way to get USB-BC/BrickID to \"play nice\" with QC.  A QC 4 power brick with USB-C will fast charge an iPhone because QC 4 includes USB-PD as part of the means for the power brick to advertise it's capability.\nNearly every USB-A power brick will be compatible with charging nearly all phones, including iPhones, at 5 watts.  That's just the lowest common denominator.  Phones should not even attempt to draw more power than that if they can't first determine the power brick capability as that's not safe.  Phones that did draw more power than 5 watts without first checking for a compatible power brick should be long gone by now, either by being recalled for being a fire hazard, or by simply going out of style.\n\nA: In fact the iPhone 6, 6s and 7 support being charged faster, as they are not limited to 1000 mA as smaller iPhones (iPhone 5s and earlier, iPhone SE).\nSo yes, you should see a faster boot with the newer models.   \n", "Q: How to play all songs I own by an artist in itunes? After I upgraded iTunes to 12.5.3.17, when I click on an artist it only shows the albums of that artist. It does not show the songs that I own of that artist from various compilations.

Move it below the zprezto stuff and it will work. The variable gets overwritten when zprezto sets up (hence why it works when you manually source the file a second time - zprezto detects it's already running so it doesn't go through its setup a second time when sourced again). This is why you should always put/source your own stuff as late in the chain as possible, it's the only way to have final say.\nYou can always rely on simple debugging with echo with stuff like this.

I have a .txt file saved on my computer. I want my Automator application to open the .txt file and then move the location of the cursor to the first blank line in the file.\nFor example, I have a .txt file entitled My Fruit Log.txt saved on my computer. This is what the contents of the .txt file may look like:\n\nSo, in the above instance, I want the file to be opened, and then the cursor moved to the second line of the file.\nNote: It is not necessarily the second line from the top where I want the cursor to be sent to. Depending on what text has already been written to the file, I might want the cursor on a lower line. For example:\n\nIn the above case, I would want the cursor to be moved to the sixth line.\nThe location where I want the cursor will always be at least the second line from the top, but it could be as far down as the seventh line from the top. \nSo, the most reliable way to articulate where I want the cursor to be placed is \"on the first instance of a blank line in the file.\"\nI already have the code to open the file in TextEdit (borrowed from the top answer of this Stack Overflow question):\nset Target_Filepath to POSIX file \"/Users/Me/Desktop/My Fruit Log.txt\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to open Target_Filepath\n\nNow I need the code to move the cursor.

For now, I'm stuck with my current 2.3GHz MacBook Pro. \nI'm not really verse with hardware, and since upgrades are very pricey, I kinda need some assurance that my choices are sustainable and the right ones. \n\n\n*\n\n*I know it's better to upgrade SSD first before RAM. Bu in running multiple memory heavy apps, isn't it better to upgrade the RAM instead of the SSD? Since booting apps or my laptop isn't really an issue. \n\n*Is a Samsung 850 Pro (1TB) a good investment and is compatible with my early 2011 MacBook Pro? I was thinking of just installing this SSD into my new laptop when the time comes, so I thought it might be a good investment to opt for one of the 'best' SSD with a larger capacity and longer 'life'/warranty. \n\n*Sorry for the ignorance, but when upgrading the RAM, do I really need to strictly purchase a 1333 MHz DDR3 (8GBx2) in order for it to be compatible? \n\n\nThank you very much! \n\nA: Answer to question 1-3:\n1.SSD or RAM?\nMy suggestion is 512GB SSD and a memory upgrade.\n2.5inch SSD that is used in an old MacBook cannot be used in a new MacBook. So 1TB is not necessary.\n512GB SSD and RAM upgrade can ensure performance and avoid the choice between SSD or RAM.\n2.RAM selection?\nSince you already have a 4GB ram, adding another 8GB ram could work just fine. It is ok if you want 8GB * 2 as well.\nRAM frequency could be 1333MHz or 1600MHz, no need to consider about compatibility.\n\nA: *\n\n*Most apps interact with disk anyway, so it makes sense to upgrade the disk. I felt the difference even after upgrading to a faster SSD.\n\n*Samsung SSDs work fine in Macbook Pro 2011. I used 1TB 840 EVO instead of Apple's stock 512GB SSD. EVO was much faster, by the way. The only thing that you should know is that if you go to Apple service, Apple's hardware test will fail on the disk only because the disk is not known to Apple. But that's nothing. My 2011 MBP works with this SSD for about three years now and the work is heavy. You may want to update the firmware of the SSD after purchasing though.\n\n*Yes, you have to stay with 1333MHz! 1600 is not stable and it will not work reliably. It may work for a while but than randomly give kernel panic. It may happen under load or when idle. I tried several 1600MHz modules including \"Mac memory\". 16GB 1333MHz work fine in MBP 2011. 1600 does \n\n\nA: I had this exact machine and went through the same debate – should I upgrade to an SSD and more RAM, or just move to a new machine?\nIf you're going to upgrade, I'd recommend buying from Other World Computing since they specialize in Mac upgrades and can guarantee compatibility. You can upgrade to a 1 TB SSD and 16 GB of RAM for ~$320 ($199 for the SSD and $120 for the RAM), and the performance difference will be huge.\nHowever, there are other things to consider, which ultimately led to me deciding to buy a new machine instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you replace the hard drive with an SSD, you have to go through the hassle (and risk) of taking things apart, removing the old drive, installing the new drive, and transferring everything over. First, you want to have a full backup of your entire drive in case anything goes wrong. You need the proper tools to remove the old drive and mount the new one. You need to install macOS on the new drive so the machine will even boot. You need a way to transfer your data from the old drive to the new one (e.g. mounting the new one in an external enclosure). Etc. All of this is doable, but it takes a significant amount of time and there's always a small risk that something goes wrong, something breaks, etc., especially if you haven't done this before.\n\n*Even if you're okay with #1, the 2011 MacBook Pro won't be supported by macOS Mojave. You'll get security updates for probably about 2 years, but otherwise you won't be receiving any major software updates. If you're at all interested in any of the new features of Mojave (dark mode!), or you run apps that might require Mojave at some point in the future, you're going to need a new machine anyway.\nAlso, for me personally, not having a retina display was a big factor (I do web development for a living and need to support retina displays, but there's no way to test graphics at different scaling factors, etc., if you don't actually have a retina display to test on).\nWith all of that combined, I decided I'd rather save the $320 and put that toward buying a new machine, instead of upgrading my 2011 model and then probably buying a new one in the near future anyway!\n", "Q: How to make command run in terminal?

On macOS, Safari can be configured to provide search suggestions \"from\" a chosen search engine. A similar feature appears to be present in iOS, but it doesn't not work as expected: even when the \"Search Engine Suggestions\" setting is disabled\n\nsearch suggestions still appear:\n\nMoreover these suggestions do not come from the search history of the specified engine (e.g., it contains entries absent from the selected engine's history) bug from somewhere else.\nWhere do the suggestions that appear in the list of suggested searches in iOS Safari come from? How do I remove individual items, or clear them all without erasing other aspects of my browser history or affecting my synced history on macOS? \n\nA: Those entries appearing as completion suggestions in the mobile Safari drop down under \"Google Search\" (or your default search engine of choice) are locally cached and are from your personal search history: e.g. somebody on that icloud account had typed \"stranger things\" in before -- not necessarily on that specific browser.\nIt can be cleared in the Settings > Safari > Clear History and Browsing Data. This will clear history, cookies, and cached pages (but not bookmarks or passwords) from the browser and from linked iCloud browsers.

I'd like the file presented in the same way printed as it is in the file. So, my question is this;\nHow do I print an 80 character wide ASCII file (and preferably specifying margins) such at the font will be fixed-width and sized appropriately to fill the entire page while still retaining the position of original line breaks and not additional wrapping. If the resultant file is a PDF or other format convertible to PDF that would be fine. If anybody could answer this question I would really appreciate it.\n\nA: In Textedit, make the file plaintext by going to the Format menu, and selecting the Make Plain Text command.

Is there any enthusiasts site or any software which can help with that?\n(It is ridiculous that these days there is no good analogue to Palm Desktop on any platform).\nThanks. \n\nA: The last ever version of Palm Desktop for Mac [4.2.2] was released in 2008 - though 4.2.1 is more common, & still available if you look around - https://palm-desktop.en.softonic.com/palm though I haven't run the Mac version in a long time, so compatibility might be suspect.\nI've found it's simpler to use a VM of Windows 7 & install to that - though my Palm iQue 360 installer now fails on anything other than a backup restored drive, as the associated internet app downloader points to nowhere.\nIt's not hugely surprising that software for something that hasn't been manufactured in 8 or so years is not easy to obtain or run.\n[download locations untested]\n\nA: Late answer, but I personally use Sync Buddy on my current Macs running Mojave. It doesn’t replace Palm Desktop but is perfect to install apps, get data and retrieve data.\n", "Q: I just tried to clean my iPhone lightning charger port with the graphite out of a mechanical pencil and now it won't charge at all I have been having problems getting my iphone to charge once it's already plugged in lately. Like a bad headphone cable sometimes just wiggling it around gets the little lightning bolt to pop up over the battery.\nSo, figuring there were some tiny debris in there I looked for a toothpick, could not find one, and proceeded to click out the \"lead\" (graphite) of a mechanical pencil and use that.\nThe phone does not charge at all now. Have tried two working chargers in different plugs, flipped sides, rubbed on it, wiggled it, etc and it absolutely will not charge now.\nTurns out graphite is a decent conductor. Is there any way I can clean it out of there using common household items?\n\nA: Graphite is a really good conductor of electricity - so the chances are what you just managed to do is connect together all the contacts in the socket.\nI think you probably need professional cleaning now.\nIf the phone had a removable battery, then I'd say remove it, grab some spray contact-cleaner from Radio Shack/Maplins etc & douse it... but not while the contacts are still live.\n\nA: It sounds like you've gotten graphite over the contacts of the port. If you don't want to get it fixed by a professional, I would suggest using cotton swabs to try to clean it off. Make sure you use some compressed air afterwards to ensure that no fibers from the cotton swabs have gotten stuck in your port.\n\nA: I would reccomend using 90% alcohol with a tiny bit of peroxide on a old or unused toothbrush and scrub out the port with it that way. i do this with all my phones and gadgets and it really saves me from a waste of time chaos and money.

I went to the Nikon site and installed S-VCNXSP-160500MF-ALLIN-ALL, but those are just transfer and editing stuff, I want to record from photobooth the raw live video.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: I think you're probably going to need Camera Control Pro 2 - the only one of their suite that isn't free. Though if you buy it from a retailer, not direct from Nikon, it's about ⅓ the price.\nI have a Nikon D5500 & also a Logitech HD Pro C920 webcam - neither of which are natively supported by QuickTime.\nUsing an app called Webcam Settings it can persuade the Logitech to show as a source for QuickTime/Photo Booth etc - but it can't persuade the Nikon to show at all.\nIt's perfectly happy recording from Camera Control, though, including Live View to the Mac & also file transfer.\n", "Q: Not requiring Apple app review for external app testing I have two apps that are currently being tested by external testers, via TestFlight.\nWhen I do a new build of one, it always goes through app review before the external testers can try the app. Reviews are currently taking from one to two days.\nAnother of my apps is always instantly available for external testers, without needing to be reviewed.\nI was wondering why this is the case? And is there anything I can do to not require a review everytime I do an update for external testers -- as is the case with one of my apps?\n\nA: Beta App Review (which is a faster process than a normal app review) is always required for external testers.\nThe testers on your other app are probably registered as internal testers. There's no review requirement for pushing updates to internal testers.\n", "Q: Win7 iTunes no longer sees new iPhone SE I recently upgraded from an iPhone 4S to an SE and successfully transferred everything.\nToday I took a photo using the new phone and wanted to download to my Win7x64 system. Previously all I had to do was plug in the phone and it would appear in my devices and as a removable drive in Windows Explorer.  The iPhone SE did not appear in Windows Explorer, and in Devices and Printers it showed up as \"Apple USB Driver\" instead of \"iPhone\".  At this point it was appearing just fine in iTunes.\nI deleted the device driver and let the system reinstall it, which restored desktop access to the photos on phone.  It appears in Windows Explorer, but curiously no longer as a removable device.\nHowever, since that point, every time I plug it in I get the \"Allow this device to access photos and videos\" prompt on the phone, but the phone does NOT appear any more in iTunes.  I suspect somehow Windows is treating it like a permanent device instead of removable and is preventing iTunes from seeing it.\nSo far I've rebooted both the phone and the computer (several times each) and reinstalled iTunes.\nNot sure what to do next.\n\nA: Go to: iTunes - Help - Run Diagnostics... - select Device connectivity tests\nThe tests will show what service is dead or running.\nUsually a dead service could cause this problem.\nIf still not solved , go to this page for more information.\n", "Q: Does higher-resolution display scaling improve movie quality? I just got a new Retina MacBook Pro, and I keep it at the default 1440x900 resolution setting due to not liking when everything is super-tiny. However, I was wondering, does the resolution setting make a difference when playing movies?\nMy thinking is that if the computer thinks it has more pixels, it should be able to display a higher-resolution video. Am I wrong, or should I make a habit of switching to the \"More Space\" resolution before playing movies?\n\nA: It depends on the software you are using. As long as you haven't selected an upscaled resolution (\"Larger Text\" in the Displays preference pane), it should work just fine with any application designed for Mac within the last few years — including Quicktime, VLC, MPlayerX, etc. Simplifying a bit, these will all recognize that your screen's \"pixels\" are actually four pixels each, and make use of them.\nHowever, if a program has not been optimized for use with retina screens, it may appear pixellated when the screen is set to a retina resolution.\n", "Q: Can I charge a MacBook Pro 2016 with a MacBook power adapter? A MacBook comes with 29W USB-C Power Adapter. A MacBook Pro 13\" (2016) comes with a 61W USB-C Power Adapter. Both are USB-C adapters. \nCan I charge the MacBook Pro 13\" with the 29W adapter?\n\nA: As with any computer, using a higher-wattage power adapter is fine, but using a lower-wattage one might not let it run at full efficiency and may be unhealthy for the battery in the long term. (And of course it won't charge as fast.)\nThere are a number of answers to this same question, but for MagSafe chargers, here. Kuba Ober's answer goes into quite a bit of detail about it, though I can't personally vouch for its accuracy.\n\nA: Theoretically you can use any USB charger to charge your 12\" Macbook, 2016 or newer 13\" & 15\" Macbook Pro.\nBy using very low power chargers like an iPhone charger your charging time will increase by many hours.\nUsing more powerful chargers will give the same result as using a standard charger. There are some exceptions however:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPad Pro models (2016 & 2017 at least) charge faster with the 29W 12\" Macbook charger. 61W or 87W Macbook Pro adapters also work but have no benefits over the 29W charger for the iPad Pro models.\n\n*iPhone 6s, 6s plus and newer iPhones charge faster with a 12W iPad adapter. This is also true with 29W, 61W or 87W Macbook (Pro) adapters although they won't charge faster than with the iPad charger.\n\n\nThere is no proof that using a quality original charger & cables will pose any harm to yourself or your devices when using USB power adapters intended for different models. Devices only pull the power they need but may refuse to work(charge) when they can't get enough. Using a charger that is way too powerful for the device may result in higher overall power consumption (from the grid) however.\n", "Q: \"XXX can't be opened.

Apple shipped the original MacBook Pro Retina 13” with a default resolution of 1280 × 800 pixels (retina).\nWhy has Apple changed the default resolution to appear like 1440 × 900?\n\nA: Scroll down to read the short answer.\n\n\nLong answer\nMBP 2nd generation, Intel\n\nIn 2008 Apple released the Unibody MacBook Pros with native display resolutions of  1280 × 800 and 1440 × 900 for the 13” and 15” inch models, respectively. The pixel density is about the same for both LCD panels. These resolutions and panel sizes were used in previous models as well.\n\nMBP 3rd generation, Intel\n\nIn 2012 the MacBook Pro with Retina display was released. Apple continued to offer the 13” and 15” models (sans the 17” one). While the size of the LCD panels remained the same, the panel’s native resolution was increased four times (double the pixel density). This resulted in a resolution of 2560 × 1600 (13”) and 2880 × 1800 (15”).\nTo remain a the same size of display elements at these resolutions Apple introduced HiDPI to macOS. An app icon of 100 × 100 on an old panel now has the size of 200 × 200. With double the pixel density it has the same size, but it’s much sharper.\n\nMBP 4th generation, Intel\n\nFast forward to 2016 Apple released the MacBook Pro with a new design. The LCD panel’s resolutions remained the same for both models. Apple, however, increased the default resolution for the 13” model from looking like 1280 × 800 to 1440 × 900 **.\nThis results in smaller text elements, icons and windows which seems counterintuitive. Although Apple has not released a statement why it did so, the reason seems to be this one: With the release of the 2016 MBP Apple stopped displaying and selling the MacBook Air 11” and the old MacBook Pro 13” (2nd gen.) in their retail stores. The remaining laptops are\n\n*\n\n*the MacBook 12” (retina, 2304 × 1440)\n\n*the MacBook Pro 13” (retina, 2560 × 1600)\n\n*the MacBook Pro 15” (retina, 2880 × 1800) and\n\n*the good old MacBook Air 13” (non-retina, 1440 × 900)\n\nCustomers looking for a 13” machine will most probably compare the MBA 13” and the MBP 13”. Although the MBP’s screen is far superior (higher physical resolution, wider color gamut, better viewing angles), the MBP 13” looks to have a smaller working area at 1280 × 800 retina compared to the MBA 13” at 1440 × 900.\nTo prevent customers from getting the impression that the MBA 13” had “larger working area” Apple increased perceived resolution from 1280 × 800 to 1440 × 900 for the MBP 13.\n\n\nTL;DR\nApple now only sells two 13\" laptops, the new 2016 MacBook Pro (MBP) and the MacBook Air (MBA) with a design from 2010.\n\n*\n\n*The MBA has a native display resolution of 1440 × 900.\n\n*The MBP has a better display with a resolution of 2560 × 1600. Until 2015 it was set to look like 1280 × 800.\n\nIn order to make it easier to compare the MBA and the MBP Apple increased the display setting for the MBP to look like 1440 × 900 by default.\n\n**\n\nAll the old Retina Pros used the 1280×800 mode as their default, but the new ones use 1440×900 mode by default; Apple does something similar with the Retina MacBook, which uses 1280×800 mode by default even though the 1152×720 mode actually reflects the panel’s native resolution. It’s a way to make the panels look higher-resolution than they are without increasing costs or wearing down the battery more quickly.\n\nSource: ArsTechnica from 2016/11\nUpdate 2021/11\n\nMBP 5th generation, Apple M1\nApple has introduced new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13\" laptops with Apple Silicon (M1) in November of 2020. The display panel resolutions remained the same for both.\n\nMBP 6th generation, Apple M1 Pro/Max\n\nIn October of 2021 Apple has released MacBook Pro M1 machines with an all new design. Finally Apple has caught up and is offering a display that is running at the 'correct' retina resolution out of the box.\nThese are the default resolutions for the new 14\" and 16\" models:\nMBP14\n\n*\n\n*True panel resolution: 3024 × 1964\n\nSupported scaled resolutions\n\n*\n\n*1512 × 982 (2x)\n\n\n*1800 × 1169 (1,68x)\n\n\n*1352 × 878 (~2,24x)\n\n\n*1147 × 745 (~2,64x)\n\n\n*1024 × 665 (~2,96x)\nMBP16\n\n*\n\n*True panel resolution: 3456 × 2234\n\nSupported scaled resolutions\n\n*\n\n*1728 × 1117 (2x)\n\n\n*2056 × 1329 (~1,68x)\n\n\n*1496 × 967 (~2,31x)\n\n\n*1312 × 848 (~2,63x)\n\n\n*1168 × 755 (~2,96x)\nAs of November of 2021 the MacBook Air 13\" M1 and the 5th generation MacBook Pro 13\" M1 are the only Apple laptops remaining that are not running at an even scaled resolution by default at 1440 × 900.\n\nA: The screens in 2016 MacBook Pros are better structured to suit scaled resolutions, with smaller gaps between each pixel. \nThis allows scales to be used that are not a perfect multiple.\n", "Q: How to bring back a Time Machine backup to only the latest file versions? I have an external disk of 2TB which is fully loaded with all versions of my backup files, saved by TimeMachine. I want to bring that back to a collection of backup files containing only the latest version of each; all older versions of all 'involved' files (files which have been altered by the system or by me) may be deleted.\nIt's not a solution to make a new backup of my current system, because the 2TB was produced using OSX El Capitan and I did a clean install of Sierra on the same hardware.\nHow can I compress the TM backup of 2TB to in fact the size of my previous (El Capitan) system?\nBtw, main goal of this all is to save (external) disk space.\n\nA: Start by mounting your Time Machine backup disk. Then open Terminal.app and issue the command:\ntmutil listbackups\n\nIt should give you a list with dates and time for all the backups stored on your drive.\nTo delete one of these backups, copy the line outputted by the listbackups command and append it to this command:\nsudo tmutil delete\n\nSo it will look like this for example:\nsudo tmutil delete '/Volumes/MyDisk/Backups.backupdb/MyMac/2016-11-24-003000'\n\nMake sure to delete only the older backups leaving the newest or some newer backups on the drive.\nThe last step is to compact the sparse bundle to release the now freed space for other purposes:\nsudo hdiutil compact /Volumes/MyDisk/MyBackup.sparsebundle\n\n(remember to edit the path to match your setup)\nIt will output status while compacting the bundle, and eventually tell you how many GB it freed.\n", "Q: How to copy thousands photos from Mac/PC to iPhone? Is there any easy and fast way to copy thousands photos from Mac/PC to iPhone?\nI tried Dropbox, but I have to export every photo one by one. Also I have tried AirDrop, but my iPhone does not show in the Mac Finder.\n\nA: You can sync them automatically by turning on iCloud Photo Library, or installing Google Photos (desktop uploader and app). Depending on the size of your library or the size of your pictures, you may have to pay for additional space on either.\nYou can also sync them manually to your iOS device, following this Apple Support guide:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure that you have the latest version of iTunes.\n  \n*Open iTunes on your computer.\n  \n*Use the included USB cable to connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer.\n  \n*Click on the device icon in iTunes.\n  \n  \n  \nIn the sidebar on the left side of the iTunes window, click Photos.\n\n\n  \n*Click the box next to \"Sync Photos.\" If instead you see \"iCloud Photos is On,\" all of your photos and videos are already on all of\n  your devices that use iCloud Photo Library. You don't need to sync\n  them through iTunes.\n  \n*Choose the app or folder that you want to sync from. If you choose to sync a folder with sub-folders, the first level of sub-folders will\n  appear as albums on your device.\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n*Choose to sync all photos or selected albums. \n  \n*Select \"Include videos\" to sync the videos from your app or folder too.\n  \n*Click Apply.  \n  \n  \n  You must import Slo-Mo and Time-Lapse videos through the Photos app or\n  Image Capture in OS X Yosemite or later for their effect to be synced\n  via iTunes. When you use iCloud Photo Library, Slo-Mo and Time-Lapse\n  videos keep their effects. Live Photos keep their effect when you\n  import them to Photos in OS X El Capitan and later, but they lose\n  their effect if you sync them back to your device via iTunes. Use\n  iCloud Photo Library so that Live Photos keep their effect, no matter\n  what device you use.   Photos that you sync using iTunes appear in a\n  \"Synced Photos\" section of the Photos app on iOS devices. If you make\n  changes to the photos synced in iTunes, the new versions replace the\n  synced photos already on the device. But anything on the device\n  outside of the \"Synced Photos\" section won't change.\n\nNote that images manually synced to your device are not editable on it.\n", "Q: Error reading /Applications/Xcode.

It's how the command line works. If you want to copy a file, you use cp /path/file /path/copy. You use spaces to signal a new argument. If you have spaces in your path, you must tell bash to ignore them: cp /path\\ with\\ spaces/file /path/copy. \nIf you use brew, they have a notice on their website that says that Xcode must not have spaces in the name, otherwise the Xcode command line tools won't work properly. (Brew link: https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/38049 )\n\nA: Is it possible this is due to the location of the xcodetools?\nGo to Xcode > Preferences > Locations and select the command line tools from the right location.\n\nA: This is not a real answer but it seems that there is a bug from apple here, so i have reported to them, this issue.\nIt shouldnt be a space between 'xcode' and '2'.\n", "Q: High-pitch sound coming from my macbook pro when I move a wired mouse I have a Macbook Pro Retina and when I move my wired mouse (mionix Naos, but same with others) there is a high pitch sound coming from my mac. \nIt does not make any sound if I don't move the mouse, or if I the integrated trackpack.\nThe sound comes from the mac. If I use headphones the sound does not come from it, but form the mac.\n\nA: Since today, I noticed same behavior with my MacBook Pro Retina 15\" (Early 2013) using a USB mouse (Roccat Kone XTD). The sound seems to come right from below the area around V key. Looking at the teardown images, right below on the logic board is an inductor and a Texas Instruments TPS51980 chip (power controller?), which could produce the noise.\nI found out that when I unplug the PSU, the buzzing seems to be quieter (but still a bit hearable).\n\nA: It might be the grounding problem. In my case, I use a 3rd party usb adaptor. The noise goes away immediately when I unplug the power from it.\nSource: https://duc.avid.com/showthread.php?t=155579\n\nA: I'm experiencing the exact same thing with my Macbook Pro 15\" Retina (Mid 2014) using both the Logitech G Pro and older G500. \nHowever, I noticed that changing the polling rate for the mouse from 1000 to 250 makes the sound very hard to hear, though the higher polling rates of 500 and 1000 makes the sound more audible. Happens with either USB input and even if both mice are plugged in at the same time. Unplugging the power adapter does not make any real difference.\n\nA: This has to be one of the strangest things I have ever heard happening. And I've been supporting Macs since the IIci was top of the line. That said, unless someone else has another Idea I would make a Genius appointment take it into an Apple store to have them have a look.\nA couple of things to check. Does the noise happen with the mouse plugged into any port? Does it happen with a wireless (with a dongle) or Bluetooth mouse? Where exactly is the noise coming from? one or more speakers, or another part of the Mac? Take the answers to those (that you can determine) to the Apple store. \n\nA: It seems to be a grounding problem. I had the same issue and it went away when I unplugged the computer from the charger. My charger is plugged into a surge+battery protector.\nI unplugged my MBP from the power source and let the battery waste a bit and then plugged the power source back in and it goes away.\n", "Q: Can I use an iTunes gift card to pay for something I bought yesterday and avoid a credit card charge?

If I do end up buying it today, will I be able to use the gift cards tomorrow on the balance to not have it ultimately avoid a charge on my credit card or can they not be used retroactively like this?\n\nA: The TL;DR is your gift card can't be used this way.\nYour account is charged before the purchase is complete.

Until then it works perfectly as well. Any idea how to resolve this issue?\n\nA: The essence of the solution described there is plausible – that it has to do with the re-keying process which occurs periodically.  You ought to see something in the Console log, and perhaps also in logs on the server side, that will point you in the right direction.\nAt random times during the lifetime of the tunnel, the two sides will re-negotiate the symmetric-cipher keys that they are using, so that the conversation does not continue to use the same keys for too long.  If this process failed, the connection would be dropped, and if it consistently occurs \"after eight minutes,\" this could well be it.  All of the parameters on both sides must match exactly, and there's nothing easy about debugging IPSec.  I'd start with Console as my starting point.  (There are several logs – look at 'em all.)\n\nA: This is fixed in Mac OS Sierra 10.12.4, since updating to this version I can keep a IKEv2 session open to pfSense for hours.\nBefore on Mac OS Sierra 10.12.3 it was disconnecting every 480 seconds (8 min).\n\nA: Someone posted a solution here: https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=110790.0\n", "Q: Assigning a keyboard to a specific app Sierra I have a Macbook Pro running Sierra with an external monitor and an Apple bluetooth keyboard.

I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) that I use with an external 4K display so I tend to leave the lid closed and plugged in almost all the time.  Since it turns off external display when not plugged in when lid is closed.  Someone told me this would ruin the battery slowly and that Li-ion batteries should be discharged to around 10% and then charged to keep them healthy and that this model trickle charges the battery which is bad for it.  They suggested a docking station that would cut off the trickle charge.\nIs this accurate information?  How should I best use this model with an external monitor to not damage the battery?\n\nA: This questions risks inviting a lot of opinion, so some may vote to close this down. \nHowever, to try and keep this to the facts, I refer you firstly to what Apple has to say about their batteries. \nIn a nutshell, the key indisputable points are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple lithium-ion batteries use fast charging to reach 80% of their capacity and then switch to slower trickle charging to complete the charge.\n\n*Charge your MacBook Pro whenever you want. Many people believe you need to let them discharge 100% before recharging. This is not true.\n\n*Ambient temperature is one of the biggest factors in battery health/life. MacBooks are designed to work at their best when ambient temperatures are between 16° to 22° C (62° to 72° F).\n\n*It’s important to avoid exposing your MacBook to ambient temperatures higher than 35° C (95° F)\n\n*If you're ever going to store your MacBook for long-term without usage, it is best to store it totally powered down and at only about half charge.\n\n\nAlso, the latest research confirms one of the most important determinants of what ruins a battery is time. (You could purchase a brand new MacBook Pro battery and leave it unused in its original packaging for five years and then find it's capacity is nowhere near what it should be when you start using it) \nFinally, since you're using your MacBook Pro in clamshell mode, you may find this general info useful.\n", "Q: Find My Phone and Deleting iPhone My iPhone is currently offline.

A cloud with a solid lining indicates the book is fully in the cloud and downloadable; a cloud with a dotted lining indicates the item is being uploaded into the cloud.\nI believe the issue is with your iCloud Drive. iBooks purchases sync with your Apple ID, and technically other stuff you add does as well, but the other items, from my understanding, actually live in your iCloud Drive. You also may need to update your Mac.. sometimes syncing is weird with older stuff (you said Sierra; not sure if High Sierra or old Sierra).

I apologize if all of these are things you have already done, but since I am new, I am unable to ask you questions yet. Good luck. I assume I can edit this answer if everything else fails... I do not have my Mac with me at work today, so I can't view my own settings. I can look when I get home if it would be beneficial.\n\nA: Best way is do it with iPhone - then select to upload - and then it synchronize to \"MacOS iBooks\" itself.\n", "Q: Win10 Bootcamp on 2016 15\" MBP woes (I think it's due to macOS not copying over ISO contents to internal partition) I've been through this a few times on my own, some really vague high level support chats (one of which said my hardware didn't support it yet?), and a call with a helpful senior support guy at apple (though he was a cpu guy for some reason and not really up to date on recent bootcamp specific changes).\nBootcamp has an acclimatization screen, continuing on from that I can select a Windows ISO image and slide my desired partition size, then hit install and the process goes on to download support drivers and then my laptop reboots. That's it. While not listed as a machine that bypasses having a USB flash drive on (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468), I have no familiar \"select task\" screen or any prompts about external media.  The bootcamp installer happily downloads support software, then I reboot into a blue screen http://imgur.com/a/c2dFY. Once back in macOS (10.12.1, Bootcamp Assistant Version 6.1.0 (6050.20.1)) the bootcamp partition is empty.\nI'm assuming that for whatever reason the contents of the ISO aren't being copied onto the internal partition, hence file not found and install hangs immediately.\nFor kicks I tried using a random file renamed as an ISO and I get the following: \"Boot Camp only supports 64-bit Windows 10 or later installation on this platform. Please use an ISO file for 64-bit Windows 10 or later installation.\" So it is recognizing my image as valid.\nTrying to do things solely from my machine I assume I'd need either:\n1) To make my own bootable Win10 USB Flash drive. All the instructions I find say to use the bootcamp assistant, are for creating bootable OS X / macOS installers (createinstallmedia), or use windows tools to create the drive. I'm assuming a simple FAT32 partition with GUID table won't work?\n2) To find out how the 2015 mac products work and mimic that once the partition is created, install process fails, and I'm back in macOS.\n\nA: Moved my win10 ISO onto someone else's 2013 MBP, created a bootable USB thumb drive there, popped it back into my laptop and copied over $WinPEDriver$ and BootCamp from WindowsSupport folder downloaded on my machine over it. Was able to install onto the existing bootcamp partition and all went well. :)\n", "Q: Problem enabling journaling in order to resize partitions on an external drive (Mac) So, heres the situation:\nI have a 500GB external USB hard drive that is formatted with the GUID Partition Map and has 2 partitions, both formatted as Mac OS X Extended (Journaled). one partition, TEMP (~120 GB), is barely being used and I have moved all data off it for this. However, the other partition, MAIN, is being used for backups and is about 320GB and is already mostly full.\nIn order to avid having to spend hours and hours creating a brand new backup after formatting the drives, I found out that you can apparently resize partitions on disks that are formatted the way I have them. Which is great, except I can't increase the size of the MAIN partition because of the following error:\nThe volume “MAIN” is not journaled. As a result it can not be resized. To enable journaling, cancel partitioning and use the “Enable Journaling” command under the “File” menu. \nI have verified and repaired both partitions numerous times with nothing bad coming up, everything is normal, however, when I go into terminal and try and manually enable journaling like it says, i get this:\n diskutil enablejournal disk1s2\nJournaling was already enabled for volume MAIN on disk1s2\n\n diskutil disableJournal disk1s2\nAn error occurred journaling the file system: The underlying task reported failure on exit (-69860)\n\nSo it thinks journaling is already enabled... bit it thinks its disabled.... and i can't turn it off and back on again to test if that works... can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong?\nEDIT: While the drive is our primary backup drive, the backup partition has been full and no backups have been completed since July so I will probably end up formatting the drive anyway, but would still be interested to know what this issue is in case anyone else has this issue.\nEDIT 2: here's the diskutil list info for the drive:\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1\n1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n2:                  Apple_HFS MAIN                    380.1 GB   disk1s2\n3:                  Apple_HFS TEMP                    119.5 GB   disk1s3\n\n\nA: Note that if you do:\ndiskutil disableJournal disk1s2\n\nand you get:\nAn error occurred journaling the file system: The underlying task reported failure on exit (-69860)\n\nthe journaling is in fact disabled. The error is bogus. Eject and remount, and you'll see journaling is now off. Does knowing this help you?\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a 1TB external drive that I needed to format from NTFS to OS X (journaled). \nNothing I did got me past the error that the single 1TB partition could not be resized since journaling was not enabled. What the Disk Utility help does not tell you is that journaling will not actually be turned on until you have ejected (not just dismounted) and reconnected the drive. \n", "Q: Update iPhone NOT to latest version I have an iPhone 4s with an iOS 7.1. I wish to update my phone to iOS 8 or 8.1 because most apps only support 8 or higher. I do not however want to update to the latest version supported on the 4s (iOS 9.3.5). Is there a way I could update by phone to iOS 8 and not iOS 9?\n\nA: What does Software Update in Settings show you? If it is iOS 9 then I'm afraid you can not upgrade to 8 via this route.\nYou cannot download iOS 8 unless Apple decides to start signing it again.\n", "Q: How to take full-resolution screenshots on iPhone? (Getting reduced from 1242 x 2208 to 674 x 1200) I've downloaded an app (that I built - I am preparing to submit) on my iPhone 6s Plus and I'm trying to prepare some screenshots for the App Store. Per documentation, the screenshots should be 1242 x 2208px, however when I take a screenshot and open it up on my desktop, I'm left with 674 x 1200px. What can I do to get the proper resolution for these screenshots?\n\nA: Screenshots should be in full resolution, but the way you send it to yourself may cause the resolution to be reduced. In particular, Google Inbox reduces the resolution of photos by default when emailing them.\nYou should be okay sending it to yourself using Apple Mail, and selecting full resolution.\n\nA: iPhone 6s Plus\nYour iPhone 6s Plus has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution at 401 psi which, as you say, should produce 1242 x 2208 pixel screenshots (in portrait). I can't explain why you're getting screenshots at 674 x 1200, except that how you're transferring them to your computer may be causing the change? \nIf you're emailing them be sure to pick the highest quality (if prompted). Otherwise you should be able to message them to your Mac as well. \niOS Simulator\nIf neither seem to work, probably the best way to generate your screenshots is to use the iOS Simulator. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Build and run your app via Xcode to the appropriate Simulator\n\n*Ensure the app is displayed at 100% scale (you can check this from the Window > Scale menu in Simulator).\n\n*Take your screenshots from within Simulator using the commandS keyboard shortcut (or going to File > Save Screenshot)\n\n*Once you have the screenshots you need, upload them to iTunes Connect.\n\n\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you're wanting to just upload one set of screenshots for the iPhone, then ensure you're using a simulator for the 5.5\" iPhone.\n\n*If you also need to upload screenshots for the iPad and only want one set, then choose the Simulator for the 12.9\" iPad.\n\n\nAny questions, just ask.\n\nA: As described in this answer, you can use the iOS Simulator to get a full-resolution screenshot.\n\nA: The answer is:\nGo to settings -> Display and Brightness -> View -> Choose standard instead of zoomed.\n\nA: To save and forward any Screen shot from an iPhone with the original screen resolution, just follow the below steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the screen shot\n\n*Save the screen shot to files (on your apple device)\n\n*then share it using AirDrop.\n\n", "Q: Spam in Apple Calendar I'm not too familiar with Apple Calendar because I don't use it, but every now & then I get spam entries ending up on it and receive alerts based on them.\nMy question is how they are getting in there (it's pretty clear that it's happening through email - but I'm not clear on the mechanics), and how do I stop it?\nScreenshot below:    \n\n\nA: First, do not \"decline\" or \"accept\" the invitation. It tells the spammer that your account is active.\nNext, you need to make a change to your iCloud account.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to icloud.com\n\n*Login to your iCloud account \n\n*Navigate to the Calendar App \n\n*Click in the settings (gear icon) in the lower left of the screen \n\n*Select \"Preference\" from the menu \n\n*Select the \"Advanced\" tab \n\n*Under the \"Invitations\" section select the \"Email to\" options\n\n\nThis will not stop the spam, but will forward it to your email, so you can deal with it there and keep it from getting to your calendar.\nYou can deal with the invitations already on your calendar by moving them to a new calendar and then deleting that calendar.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new iCloud calendar (not “On My Mac”).\n\n*Move the spam event to the new iCloud calendar.\n\n*Delete the new iCloud calendar.\n\n*Calendar will now prompt you with “Delete and Don’t Notify” and “Delete and Notify”.\n\n*Select “Delete and Don’t Notify”.\n\n\nA: I have not tested how to prevent it yet, but I have tested the so-called workaround being passed around that recommends moving the invite to a temporary calendar, then deleting that calendar, and answering \"Delete and Don't Notify\" -- it STILL sends a DECLINE notice.\nFolks passing it around and up voting it here and elsewhere did not actually test it out, they just assumed the \"Delete and Don't Notify\" button did what it promised to do.\nTry it with another iCloud user. Your status on their invite will go from NO REPLY to DECLINED shortly after you click \"Delete and Don't Reply.\"\nThis is repeatable on macOS Sierra 10.12.1 and Calendar 9.0 (2155.8) both are latest versions as of this writing.\n", "Q: Is it possible to only sync favorite photos/videos to iCloud from my iPhone? So, I've accumulated a lot of photos and videos on my iPhone and I'm happy to sync a few to iCloud, but I don't really want all of them there. Partially because there are lots of near-duplicates and also because I don't have enough space in iCloud.\nInstead, I would like to ONLY sync favorites to iCloud and not bother with the non-favorites. Any ideas on how to do so?\niPhone 6\niOS 10.1.1\n\nA: No, but it's possible using Apple's iCloud Drive.\nWith iCloud Drive, you can safely store all your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images and any other kind of document in iCloud — and access them from your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac or PC.\nFollowing are the steps to upload your favourite pics on iCloud:\nStep 1: Open your favourite photo from photos app which you would like to upload on iCloud.\nStep 2: After opening it, go to options\n\nStep 3: Select Add to iCloud Drive option\n\nStep 4: Select iCloud drive from the list. If you want to save your photo inside a folder present in the iCloud drive, choose that. For example, here if I want to save the photo in AI T2 folder I can choose that by tapping on it.\n\nHere's the pic after upload:\n\nNOTE\nMake sure you have iCloud Drive app on your iPhone. If you don't have it then go to the App Store and search for iCloud Drive. Since, you are on iOS 10 you can download Apple's builtin apps from App Store (and delete them too). If this doesn't work, Go to Settings -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive -> Switch Show on Home Screen to On.\nHere's the iCloud Drive app on the homescreen.\n\n", "Q: iMessage text turning orange When I send a text in iMessage sometimes some of the writing goes orange and the rest is normal black.  Its not certain words that change to orange its really random and doesn't happen with every iMessage.  Have looked in settings but cant find anything I have changed or selected.  I am using iOS 10.2 on an iPhone 7.   \n\nA: That's because those words can be replaced by Emojis. Apple released that with iOS 10 and when you type something in iMessage and select emoji keyborad(if that has a meaning matching with Emojis) it will make that word orange. If you want to replace that word with an emoji, then you simply have to touch that orange coloured word and it will be replaced by that emoji. \nIt is not a problem with your phone or any software issue. It is a feature introduced by Apple. \nEx: Type My car is down. Then select emoji keybord and it will show \"car\" word orange coloured. \n", "Q: Random sale ad in Calendar This morning when I opened by computer, I saw a notification for an event that I never created.\n\nI have not linked my email address on macbook and I'm not even from US. So why is there an event with some random website in my calendar? I checked which apps have access to calendar, and it came up empty. So is it just some harmless ad pushed by Apple or something malicious?\n\nA: Seeing the event is unnerving but, thankfully, it is unlikely to be a virus or current problem with your MacBook.\nInstead it is possible this event came from an unwanted e-mail; Mail.app on macOS and on iOS has the ability to add events discovered in your e-mails.\nYou can disable this feature using the steps from How to disable suggested events in Calendar on iOS and Mac:\n\nHow to disable Mail event suggestions on OS X\nDo the following on your Mac with OS X 10.11 El Capitan or later:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Mail.\n\n*Choose Preferences from the Mail menu.\n\n*Click the General tab.\n\n*Select Never in the drop-down menu labeled “Add invitations to Calendar”.\n\n\n", "Q: MacBook Air: Playing 1080p vs 720p videos I  have a MacBook Air 13-inch 2013 model and I was wondering if it is worth downloading 1080p movies if I have the option for 720p?\nI know 1080p is much more crisp on my TV, but does the MacBook Air have enough resolution to even see the difference?\n\nA: Your MacBook Air supports the following resolutions at 16:10 aspect ratio:\n\n\n*\n\n*1440 x 900 (native)\n\n*1280 x 800\n\n*1152 x 720\n\n*1024 x 640 \n\n\nIt also supports the following at 4:3 aspect ratio:\n\n\n*\n\n*1024 x 768\n\n*800 x 600\n\n\nSince 1080p is technically a resolution of 1920 x 1080 your MacBook Air isn't going to display a 1080p movie at its best on its built in display. However, your MacBook Air does support an external resolution of up to 2560 x 1600 pixels, so you'd be able to take advantage of 1080p in that scenario.\nFinally, whether you download 1080p or 720p movies also gets down to personal preference. Most people I know with true HD TVs still only download 720p versions because the difference to them (especially while watching most movies) is negligible. Basically, do you notice the extra pixels during a high speed chase in an action movie or not? Many people don't, some people do.\nIn summary, if you're downloading movies only to watch on your MacBook Air via it's built in display, there's no real advantage to downloading the 1080p version. \n", "Q: My iPhone has decided to wipe all Firefox bookmarks out of the blue From yesterday on, my iPhone decided to just delete every single bookmark from bookmarks and now I have nothing on Firefox.

I just got an iPhone 7. But my email address book has merged with my phone number contact list. How do I remove the email addresses?\n\nA: iCloud for Web can be used to restore the contact list before merging. Go to iCloud Settings and under Advanced click Restore Contacts.\n\nA: Go to Settings > Contacts > Accounts and select the email account that is showing on your contacts. \nSwitch \"Contacts\" off on that account. It will warn you that those contacts will be deleted from your iOS device. \nTap on \"Delete from my iPhone\".\nI recommend to chose one \"email address book\" and work with it so it becomes your phone/email/etc address book: this way you'll have a copy of your information synced and available in case your device has a problem, and it will simplify migration.  \nIf your email contacts are from work, you can open an iCloud account or another email service to sync personal contacts. \nYou can browse selectively between contacts when you have more than one account source.\nOn the Phone or Contacts apps look for \"Groups\" on the top left of your screen.\nYou can select there between your different accounts Contacts.\n\nA: I just solved this by clicking \"groups\" while in my contacts and turning off Yahoo.

Short Story: I recently lost all my sent emails (POP3) on my iPad when I migrated my server and password.  The domain name and username did not change.  Is there any way to recover those sent emails?\nLonger Story: My web host just migrated to a new system.  They advised me my account might not work.  When my email went down, I moved everything to my secondary server. \nI didn't change my email address, but I had to change my password for email on this secondary server, because of its password rules. At this point, all my emails, inbox and sent, were still on my iPad.\nWhen I updated the password on my iPad so it would download emails from the new server, everything else disappeared.  All my old inbox messages, and all my sent emails.\nI can recover my Inbox from archives on the old server, but it doesn't have my sent emails. Support tells me those were only local.\nI'm hoping there's some way to recover those.\nThanks for your advice.\nAlec\n\nA: After being told on the Apple Discussion boards that this can't be done, I found a solution.\nI re-entered all the original log in information into the account details.  It took a bit to get them to stick, because iPad kept trying to verify the account, which it couldn't do, because the legacy server wasn't responding, but I finally got it.  Once the I had the original credentials entered, all the original Inbox and Sent emails were back.\nOne important key: Although I didn't change my email address, the new server did require a different username syntax.  The old username was just \"name\" while the new username was \"name@mydomain.com\".  That little change is what caused iPad to decide it was an entirely different account.\n", "Q: Can't restore or update IPhone - TATSU declined to authorize I'm attempting to either restore or update an iPhone 5 which won't boot.

Then the next morning I got up, powered it up, and it very rarely makes it to the login screen - the problem was still there.\nAt this point, every single part in this computer has been replaced and/or tested except the graphics card (Radeon HD 6970m 2GB) and the optical drive. I am also aware of a defective line of these exact iMacs with the exact same graphics card that Apple actually issued a recall on (see here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203787) Unfortunately this particular iMac was purchased more than 4 years ago so Apple won't replace it.\nIs my problem most likely the video card? Am I stupid to go and spend $250 on another one off eBay, or is this computer simply cursed.\nThanks for any help. I would really like to get this working - its a very nice computer and as an amateur video editor it would be wonderful to have a decently powerful Mac (also 4K displays are nice!).\nTL;DR\nGot a 27\" iMac free. It randomly reboots. Have tried replacing every component except graphics card. Can a graphics card cause random reboots, and is it worth replacing?\n\nA: You may find this question of interest to you. \nUnfortunately, this iMac still has intermittent problems and sometimes boots and sometimes doesn't. When it doesn't it just keeps restarting, and even when it does boot it will randomly reboot at some point.\nHowever, to answer your question, yes, a graphics card can cause random reboots. Whether or not it's worth $250 to replace only you can answer. Obviously, if it fixes the problem it's money well spent. If it doesn't, then not. \nBut it's what I wanted to do next on the iMac I was troubleshooting, but the owner decided to call it quits. If it was me, I'd personally take the plunge and if it didn't resolve the problem I'd try and resell the graphics card. But that's a personal choice on my behalf and you need to do what you're comfortable doing.\n", "Q: Oddly randomized mounted paths in Sierra for certain apps? I've noticed something very peculiar with 10.12 that was not happening with 10.11 and before.  An example app is PTHPasteboard.  I've seen this with a couple others, but it doesn't seem to always happen.\nHere's the output of df:\n/Volumes/hostname_usr/Users/username/Library/PreferencePanes/PTHPasteboard.prefPane/Contents/Resources/PTHPasteboard.app  1.8Ti  630Gi  1.2Ti    34% 13477289 4281489990    0%   /private/var/folders/cb/72l1ml4267v5hdqmpk4__1p00000gn/T/AppTranslocation/3B5721C9-320C-429B-9141-68AB27C5BC8C\n\nThe problem with this is that this randomization causes macOS to think that it's a new app each time and does things like prompt if it is okay to open this app or Little Snitch prompts for network access, etc.  Of course this can be a hassle when opening multiple apps that do this at startup and the apps actually start right away and then these things timeout and won't run.\nWhat is this behavior and how can I make it stop?  The apps are installed in /Applications (or in this case, in my prepane folder).\n\nA: Found the answer for what's going on here, TL;DR: \nRemove quarantine for the offending app, in my case:\nsudo xattr -d -r -s com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/PreferencePanes/PTHPasteboard.prefPane\n\n\nApparently with 10.12 (Sierra) Apple has implemented something called \"App Translocation\" and is documented under the \"What's New in OS X\" -> \"Security and Privacy Enhancements\":\n\nStarting in OS X v10.12, you can no longer provide external code or data alongside your code-signed app in a zip archive or unsigned disk image. An app distributed outside the Mac App Store runs from a randomized path when it is launched and so cannot access such external resources.\n\nThere is further explanation in \"OS X Code Signing In Depth\":\n\nIf using a disk image to ship an app, users should drag the app from\n  the image to its desired installation location (usually /Applications)\n  before launching it. This also applies to apps installed via ZIP or\n  other archive formats or apps downloaded to the Downloads directory:\n  ask the user to drag the app to /Applications and launch it from\n  there.\nThis practice avoids an attack where a validly signed app launched\n  from a disk image, ZIP archive, or ISO (CD/DVD) image can load\n  malicious code or content from untrusted locations on the same image\n  or archive. Starting with macOS Sierra, running a newly-downloaded app\n  from a disk image, archive, or the Downloads directory will cause\n  Gatekeeper to isolate that app at a unspecified read-only location in\n  the filesystem. This will prevent the app from accessing code or\n  content using relative paths.\n\nSee this for further information.\nI really appreciate what the author of that article notes here:\n\nUnder what circumstances does App Translocation occur?\nFirst, the app must have a com.apple.quarantine extended attribute. If\n  you delete the quarantine xattr, then App Translocation does not\n  occur, and the app will launch from where it was unarchived, like\n  normal. \nSecond, the app must be opened by Launch Services. This usually means\n  Finder, but it can also mean open from Terminal, for example. If you\n  launch the app executable directly from bash, on the other hand, App\n  Translocation does not occur. \nThird, the app must not have been moved — by Finder. If you move the\n  app, using Finder, from the app's original unarchived location to\n  another folder, even a subfolder, e.g., ~/Downloads/Test/, then App\n  Translocation does not occur. \nHowever, if you move the app using mv from Terminal, then App\n  Translocation will still occur. Normally you would move the app from\n  ~/Downloads to /Applications, and that would cause the app to be\n  launched from /Applications like normal, but the locations of the\n  particular folders don't seem to matter. \nThe mere act of moving the app using Finder stops App Translocation\n  from happening. Indeed, once you've moved the app once, it will no\n  longer experience App Translocation again, even if you then move it\n  back to ~/Downloads.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to replace my username in Terminal with special characters? I found this which seems close to the solution, but it's not quite there.\nEDIT: With JavaScript, I know I can just run test.replace(/\\w/g, \"*\"), where test is my username, but I don't know the equivalent for the Terminal.\n\nA: The PS1 prompt is defined in /etc/bashrc and the default is usually PS1='\\h:\\W \\u\\$ '. You'd replace the \\u with *****. You could also just add, e.g export PS1='\\h:\\W *****\\$ ' to your ~/.bash_profile file, while leaving the system file (/etc/bashrc) alone.\n\nA: The hidden username should be the same length as the original username? Like so:\nAlices-MacBook:~ *****\nBobs-MacBook:~ ***\nThe following code snippet should do the job (and, as a bonus, it'll also hide hostname). Add it to your ~/.bash_profile, or wherever you set PS1. (I created a temporary file - test.sh - for testing, and then sourced that file - '. ./test.sh'. If something had gone spectacularly wrong, and I'd made my prompt illegible, I could simply restart the terminal and be back to my old prompt).\nPROMPT_COMMAND=__prompt_command\n\n__hide_string()\n{\n    echo \"$1\" | sed 's/./\\*/g'\n}\n\n__prompt_command()\n{\n    PS1=\"$(__hide_string $HOSTNAME):\\W $(__hide_string $USER)\\$\"\n}\n\nThis will replace every character in the username with a \"*\" (it'll also do it for the hostname, to show function reuse). I consider this to be less than ideal - the function gets called (twice - once for user, once for hostname) every time the prompt is displayed (even though the username hasn't changed): with a bit of hacking it should be possible to amend it so that it only calls the '__hide_string' function when PS1 is set (i.e. at login).\nExplanation: the __prompt_command function we've defined sets PS1 every time the prompt is displayed. (This is probably overkill, but keeps things 'dynamic'). PS1 should be familiar; the only new stuff is that '\\h' and '\\u' are replaced with calls to the __hide_string function (and use $HOSTNAME and $USER as arguments). __hide_string is the fun part: it echoes its argument to sed, which replaces every individual character with a '*'.\n", "Q: Mac Terminal NetStat How can I use NetStat on my mac to view all connected IPs of a gaming server? I wonder if theres a way to see how many ms they have.\n\nA: netstat(1) only tells you about the connections local to the machine you are running it on. So if you can run netstat on the gaming server, then you can find out the IP's of the clients. Look for connections to the game servers port. \nIf you are looking to find out the ping time or lag for each of the clients I'm not sure there is a good way unless you are running on the game server, and then you may get an idea of the lag by getting the IP addresses of the clients and then running ping(8) on each of the addresses.  \n", "Q: get photos from old iphone to new iphone through icloud data backup I just bought a new iPhone 6 and I want all my old photos in the camera roll to my new phone.\nI was using an iPhone 5 and I keep all my photos backed up on my iCloud account.\nIf possible, how do I get all those photos in my new phone through iCloud?\n\nA: Check Use iCloud backup part.\nCheck this out :  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201269\n", "Q: Is there any way to recover your apple ID if you forget both your password and your recovery key? Is there any way to recover your apple ID if you forget both your password and your recovery key?\nIf this happens: would it mean you wouldn't be able to use your your iOS devices that used that apple ID with activation lock active?\nCould you contact Apple to solve this issue?\nI hope it never happens to me, but I'd just like to know this.\n\nA: This happened to me! I created a new Apple ID using my device (because it was the only way to create an Apple ID without having to have a non-iCloud email account associated with it), didn't realise that Find My iPhone was switched on, and then promptly forgot both the password and the security questions/answers for the account. I could still use the device, but I was unable to switch off Find My iPhone or erase the device. So I force-restored the device, but was then presented with the activation lock.\nApple helped me reset the activation lock because I was able to prove that I purchased the device. Your receipt contains identifying information such as the Serial Number and IMEI number, so when I provided Apple with this receipt, they were able to remove the activation lock for me.\nBut I never recovered the Apple ID itself.\n\nA: Apple covers the options fairly well at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204921\nThe short answer is it depends. \n", "Q: When I turn on my MacBook Pro, I see the Apple logo and the progress bar but then it turns off When I switch on my MacBook Pro 2011, I see the Apple logo with progress bar but before it enters the next screen it turns off.

There are two 'Library' directories in my OS X 10.11 installation, one being /Library/, the other being /System/Library/.\nWhat is the difference between different Library folders?\n\nA: As in all the Unix system, there are two type of lib folder. \nOne specific for the user and the other for the entire system and so all the users of the machine. \nIn particular for OS X: the Macintosh HD version is the actual computer Library, while, the home folder version is specific to your user account.\n\nHere an example to help you understand how to use it: \n/System/Library is a place to store fonts, screen savers, Dashboard widgets, and all other things that all local users need access to.\n~/Library is for your own user account only (cache and preference files, widgets for your use only, etc).\n\nEDIT: taken from here, a complete overview of all the possible library folders in a Mac OS X system: \n\n\n*\n\n*The user library, ~/Library, stores per-user settings etc.\n\n*The local library, /Library, stores computer-wide settings and all-users content etc. I call this the \"local\" library, because in NextStep it was /Local/Library, but you'll see all sorts of other names for it, such as the root library, computer library, ...\n\n*The network library, /Network/Library would store settings shared by all computers in a network domain -- if a network domain admin set one up, which nobody does anymore...\n\n*The system library, /System/Library, stores the base settings, resources, etc that come with OS X. In theory, you shouldn't change anything in here.\n\nA: macOS has 3 types of Libraries.\nHere are the following:\n/Library/ - Used to control system wide settings that are used by all users\nUsually no reason for regular user to alter, although applications will alter this during and post installation\n/System/Library/ - Same as /Library/ but protected by SIP. Used by macOS as the core Library. Most things in there are required by macOS.\nShouldn't (and can't without SIP being disabled) be altered.\n~/Library/ - Same as /Library/ but for user specific things (Each user has one.\n\nYou can access each of these by going to Finder>Go>Go To Folder and typing in their respective path.\n\nA: /System/Library is for stuff that doesn't change and is installed by Apple. Files here help the operating system run.\n/Library is for things that may change and that pertain to all users on a computer.\nAnd for completeness (although not mentioned in the question):\n~/Library is where things that may change specific to a particular user go.\n", "Q: Reminders badge shows wrong count on different devices I have an iPhone, iPad, MacBook and Mac mini and am using Reminders on all my devices synced through iCloud. I have several lists created and no incomplete items at the moment. However, the Reminders badge count on MacBook shows \"2\" while on Mac mini it shows \"1\". On both iPhone and iPad the count is none (\"0\"), which is correct. If I check on my iCloud.com account the count is also none.\nWhere do these phantom alerts come from then? And how do I get rid of them?\n\nA: You can try force refresh Reminders in iCloud with a debug trick:\nGo to Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and enter the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.reminders RemindersDebugMenu 1\n\nNow open Reminder (or restart the app) and you will see a debug menu, go into that menu and click Refresh, and see if it solves your problem.\nHere is a picture of that menu:\n\nTo get rid of the debug menu enter this command:\ndefaults delete com.apple.reminders RemindersDebugMenu\n\nThen restart Reminder app.\n\nA: First I thought, restoring an older instance of the \"Calendars and Reminders\" storage via iCloud.com fixed the phantom badge for me, but it came back after a little while!\nAfter spending a ridiculous amount of time trying all the suggestions here and all over the internet, the only procedure that really helped in the end (at least so far, fingers crossed!) was the one described in the \"Mac\" section of the Apple Support document \"Get help using iCloud Contacts, Calendars, or Reminders\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences... / iCloud and disable Calendars and Reminders\n\n*Close the System Preferences\n\n*Wait for 1 minute\n\n*Go to System Preferences... / iCloud again\n\n*Enable Calendars and Reminders\n\n*Reboot the Mac\n\n\nThat last point is crucial. Only after the reboot, the phantom badge was gone (and is still gone since about 30 minutes). And no, rebooting alone, without the steps before, didn't help either.\n\nA: TLDR: Launch the Calendar app, go to Settings, Alerts, then enable \"Show shared calendar messages in Notification Center\" and reboot.\nLonger explanation follows.\n\nI was having this same problem: no badge on my iOS devices, but a badge of \"1\" on my Mac.\nAfter searching through the Console app, I found some messages from CalNCService that indicated it was requesting a badge count of \"1\" on behalf of a EKCalendarInviteReplyNotification. This suggested that the badge was the result of some activity on a shared Reminders list. It even printed out the name of the list in question - a shared list that I had \"left\" a while ago.\nBut, there were no notifications in Notification Center related to this list. Well, it turns out the notification was being filtered out by a setting in the Calendar app. I went to Calendar.app -> Settings -> Alerts and enabled \"Show shared calendar messages in Notification Center\".\nThat by itself did nothing, because the event was already filtered. So I went to Activity Monitor and force-quit the CalNCService. I restarted the Calendar app so it would restart the service (rebooting would do the trick too), and BOOM, the system presented me with the missing notification!\nThe notification was that I no longer had access to this shared list (sigh, who cares). I'm guessing the person who originally shared it with me had deleted it. So I simply dismissed that notification and the badge went away.\nBonus explainer:\nWhy does Calendar have anything to do with Reminders? It's because Reminders, internally, was originally (and seems to still be) implemented using \"secret\" hidden calendars. They did this because, in the days before iCloud, Calendar syncing was one of only a handful of ways to share data between devices. So you could sync and share your Reminder lists even if you were using Google or Yahoo or whatever else. Another way to share data was through email servers - which is exactly what the Notes app did. Reminders == Calendars, Notes == Emails.\nClever at the time, but I'm sure the engineers are quite sick of it now.\n\nA: On iOS there's no need to reboot for updating the reminders badge notification. Just open the Calendar App, press \"Calendars\" and pull down the entire page for updating all of your Calendars. This will force the update of your reminders too.\n\nA: I solved this issue by Restoring Reminders and Calendars from my iCloud setting page, as suggestion by this communities thread. I used a very recent backup (this morning's), so no loss of data was involved. It doesn't matter if the eroneous badge was present for a longer amount of time.\n\nA: I had same problem on my new iPhone 7plus. Fixed it by doing the reboot by holding sleep wake  and volume down buttons and then turning back on.\n\nA: Found an answer here:\n\nWhat does appear to work is killing the Dock process. To do this, simply launch Activity Monitor, find the item named “Dock,” and click Quit Process. The Dock will disappear, relaunching a few moments later. And behold! No more phantom badge.\n\nIt worked for me when everything else failed.\n\nA: Killing the dock agent on Activity monitor was the only thing that actually worked.\n", "Q: How to sign out of iCloud on iPhone and Macbook without having access to rescue email and with Find my iPhone and Find my Mac turned on? I have an iPhone 7 Plus and a Macbook Pro 15\" 2014.\nI was trying to make calls from Facetime Audio on Mac from my iPhone. My Apple ID was asked on Facetime on Mac. I entered my details and it told me that your account has been locked due to security reasons.\nSo please enter the answer to your security questions which I don't remember. I entered twice and it greyed out this option of security questions. Now the only thing I was left with was to email myself (through Apple) the reset link so as to reset the password. But here's the bad thing that happened to me: The email that I was using with iCloud and Apple ID was my previous employers email and since I left the job, I couldn't access it anymore. So I couldn't get the reset link. Same thing happened with me on both iOS and Macbook.\nNow I can't have iCloud sync between both these devices, can't download anything from the appstores on both the devices. I tried signing out of iCloud on my iPhone (and on Mac) but since my Find my iPhone(Find my Mac on Mac) was ON, it didn't let me sign out. I backed up my iPhone and tried erasing all my iPhone so that I could log in with some new Apple ID but since FInd my iPhone was ON, I couldn't erase my device either. Also tried restoring through iTunes, but all in vain since Find my iPhone was ON.\nWhat should I do now? My Macbook and my iPhone are my primary devices and I can't live without iCloud syncing on.\n\nA: First of all, the comment by Patrix is an excellent way to start. I've helped many users by using the various options there (sometimes having to add other security email addresses, calling Apple Support, etc). This process may or may not be extremely frustrating - I've seen users sort things out pretty quickly, and others who have had to wait days for Apple to call them back once everything was sorted.\nHowever, another option which may or may not be palatable to you is to just contact your previous employer. \nAbout six weeks ago I came across a very similar situation, except in their case it was an old email address from an ISP they were no longer with. After some negotiation the old ISP agreed to recreate the email address at their end for one hour and set it up to autoforward to the user's current email address. During that hour the user was able to access the emails from iforgot.apple.com and change their email address etc.\nOf course, in your case it may be a case of being allowed access to your old email (either because it still exists, or because they've recreated the address for you). Or they could set up an autoforward as happened in the above example.\nIf this isn't an option, then iforgot.apple.com really is your only option.\n\nA: Ask Apple support. They will as you proof of ownership.\n", "Q: Multiple apple account on the same mac wait 90 days to download? So I have a US itunes account and a German one, because the US gets stuff earlier.

It could be corruption of your backups, or of your Time Machine binary, or something related.\nSorry this isn't definitive, but I'd recommend checking disk status first to isolate the problem.\n", "Q: How do I navigate to Mouse & Trackpad in Accessibility Settings with AppleScript?

I would want a 27'' with 2560x1440 resolution but I have a doubt:\na mini diplay port/DVI converter is sufficient or I will need this one? Mini DisplayPort/Dual-Link DVI http://www.apple.com/it/shop/product/MB571Z/A/adattatore-da-mini-displayport-a-dvi-dual-link \nthe description of the adapter says:\n\nUse the Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter to connect your Mac to a 30-inch display that includes a DVI connector, such as the 30-inch Apple Cinema Display HD, and enjoy the ultimate widescreen canvas with a resolution of 2560 by 1600 pixels.\n\nHardware specs for my model say (https://support.apple.com/kb/SP620?locale=it_IT&viewlocale=en_US): \n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors\n\nThank you for your anwser.\n\nA: If you want a resolution of 2560x1440 and you want to use DVI, then you must use a Dual Link DVI adapter.  Period.  A Single Link DVI connector will only support up to 1920x1200.\nThat said, I wouldn't recommend going with Dual Link DVI but rather getting a monitor that natively support Display Port or mini Display Port like the Dell UltraSharp U2715H\n\nI am a big proponent of the idea that the less you have to convert, the better the reliability.\n\nA: I've got MBP Early 2013, 13\" and just bought Eizo 2750, 27\" with 2660x1440 resolution. First I've tried it to connect it through mini Display Port -> adapter -> DVI D -> HDMI (I do not have mini Display to HDMI cable yet). With above config I'v achieved that resolution, though with refresh rate 30Hz, which is not acceptable for longer work. \nThan I'v tried a cable mini Diplay Port -> Display Port and it works great with 60Hz, only strange thing that it uses NTSC not PAL, but see no difference.\nSo you don't know until you try, imho the best solution is to go to the store with the laptop and bunch of cables and ask to try chosen display :) remember to check not only resolution you've got but also refresh rate, at least 60Hz (59 on NTSC) is a minimum for decent work\n", "Q: iPhone Keyboard font How do I make my Keyboard font on iPhone 6 larger?\nI have tried enlarging my fonts on the phone - it only enlarges the typed words I need to have the Keyboard Lager, my fingers are too large so when I type I keep hitting the wrong letters.

I am using iTunes on OS X El Capitan. I have a CD with songs on it and I would like to import these into the iTunes library (the local one, not the cloud). For the option in preferences, I have it set to \"Ask to import CD\", but the dialogue for that does not show up. Is there some way to MAKE it import the songs without having to wait for a dialogue to pop up? Like maybe something in the menu bar that says \"Import songs from CD\"?\nUpdate: And now, when iTunes is running, the CD/DVD is being ejected right after being inserted.\n\nA: Assuming that the CD shows up fine on your computer, you should be able to manually start the import process by opening iTunes and going to: File > Add to Library \nIn the file dialog that opens, you should see your CD listed on the left side under \"Devices\". Click this, select all songs, and click \"Open\" to import the songs. \nAlso:\nTo try and clarify what the other answer says, when a CD is inserted, a CD icon usually appears in the upper left hand corner of the main iTunes window. Clicking or right-clicking on this should give some import options.\n\nA: When the CD appears into iTunes as the CD that it is, doesn't right-clicking the songs reveal a \"Create mp3 version\" action in the menu that appears?\n", "Q: Why is the audio of my MacBook is becoming scratchy? Okay, this is very weird. I've a MacBook Pro Retina 2014 model. It's all going very well. Sadly I've to use it in a dusty area most of the time.

Lots of buzzing and screeching and it's not as loud anymore!\nI usually clean it by vacuuming around the keys and under the screen. I did look up some results online and couldn't find anything useful! \nAny help?\n\nA: A vacuum cleaner can damage the small cones attached to the magnetic cone of a dynamic speaker, like in your MacBook Pro.  Similarly, a can of compressed air can damage the diaphragm.  One reason for buzzy, distorted sound is damage to these speaker components.  \nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Store/Mac/MacBook-Pro-15%22-Retina-Mid-2014\nThe above iFixit website (with whom I have no affiliation) describes how to tear down your Macbook Pro to see if your speakers are damaged.

The thing is, my Mac works and I love it, but a couple of months ago, without doing anything, loading web pages even with Chrome as with Safari is extremely slow. My girlfriend has a Windows laptop and it works perfectly and when I connect to a different Wi-Fi router it works great. So my guess is there is a problem with my Mac related to my router.\nI have tried several solutions already - I changed all of the DNS servers you can imagine in macOS and on my router as well, restarted my network settings, excellent namebench to see which is the right DNS for me, clearing caches...

If you change the login password in Users & Groups preferences, the keychain password is automatically updated to match it. If your login password is reset by an administrator, your keychain password is not reset automatically, and you’re asked to reset the keychain password the next time you log in. You can also update the keychain password to match your new login password.

I would like to see the OS update history in my iPad, as in when and at what time did I install a specific iOS update in my device. \nIs there any way to see that?\n\nA: IOS differs from macOS.\nmacOS updates the OS via App Store. And App Store keeps tracking what we have updated.\nUnfortunately, iOS updates via Software Update in Settings. And it doas not keep history of the updates. I think there is no workaround at the moment. And I think iTunes login can't help in this case.\n", "Q: Sharing Mac files with windows 10 I have followed instructions found here but I am unable to see the Mac book as a computer in windows 10 network places. Nor can I map it.\nBelow is what the Mac screen looks like. Even the IP address is not the regular format (numbers). I'm not sure what needs to be done to make this work.\nAll help is appreciated.\n\nUpdate\nThe computer name/workgroup in MAC and PC are the same\n\nWindows PC name\n\nNow, you might see a difference between the computer name in the above. I tried both. Naming the computer in MAC under NETBIOS the same as that in Windows and naming it differently (as shown in the pictures). None worked\nThe IP address in MAC was the same as that when I logged into the windows. Both the windows and MAC OS are on the same PC so not sure if that makes any difference. Started with a  192.\n\nIn windows, when I ping the IP address is worked fine, but probably because the IP address in both MAC and PC are obviously the same. When I tried pinging the computer name (when different in MAC from Windows) it didn't work. I got the following error\n\nNot sure what more I need to do. Elsewhere, I was told that with the latest version of Windows 10, file sharing isn't possible.\n\nA: Step 1:\nOn the Mac, go to  System Preferences > Network.  Then on the active network (WLAN or Ethernet, whatever you use) click Advanced > WINS.\nGive the computer a name and the same Workgroup as the Windows computer:\nTo find the Workgroup on Windows, start Explorer, right-Click \"My Computer\", \"Properties\".  This will show the workgroup the Windows-PC is on.  Use the same workgroup on the Mac.  \nAlso make sure that IP-V4 and IP-V6 is enabled on Mac OS (also System Preferences > Network).\nYou can now try to shortcut to Step 6 and see if it works.  If not, proceed with Step 2.\n\nStep 2:\nOn Mac OS open a Terminal and type ifconfig.  You should get an output like this.  Find the ip-address (something different than 127.0.0.1):\n\n\nStep 3:\nOn the Windows computer, open a command prompt.  Type ipconfig ... this should give you output with an IPv4-Address that starts with the same numbers as the one from the Mac (e.g. also 192.168.1.xxx).\nType ping 192.168.1.149 (but with your Mac's IP address from step 2).   If that works, type ping computername (but with the name you gave your Mac from step1).  Both should result in the same output, like this: \n\n\nStep 4:\nIn windows explorer, in the address bar, type \\\\192.168.1.149  (but again with your IP address).  You should now see your shared folders (thse from your own screenshot).\n\nStep 5:\n\\\\computername  (but with the name from the mac network config).\nThis should also show your data folders.\n\nStep 6:\nIf all that works, you should also see the Mac in Windows > Explorer > Network (on the left bar in Explorer).\n", "Q: Can I block Chrome's notification with Mac's Do Not Disturb? I don't want to get notification while I'm working so I want to disable Chrome's all notification (Settings -> Show Advanced Settings -> Privacy -> Content Settings -> Do not allow any site to show notifications)  from Mac's Do Not Disturb mode?\nIs it automize with Automator or something else? \n\nA: Yes, I finally found a solution for this.\nChange the following propery\nchrome://flags/#enable-native-notifications\n\nas ON. After that you can see all Chrome notification's from Mac's default notification center so it will work if you enable do not disturb mode from Mac's settings.\n\nA: Unfortunately, it's actually not possible to disable Chrome's notifications using Apple's Do Not Disturb mode. Chrome's notifications are sent through Chrome itself and not through Mac's notifications center. So, the only way is to use an extension or block them through Chrome's Settings page.\nGoogle has a support article regarding this.\n\nBlocking notifications and hiding them are different.\nBlocking notifications means that you can't get to receive them, neither can you check on them when you're free. However, hiding them means that you won't receive it at that time, but they will be available in the notifications centre.\n\nYou can block notifications by going to (Settings -> Show Advanced Settings -> Privacy -> Content Settings -> Do not allow any site to show notifications).\nIf you want to hide them for the time being, you can turn on your Mac's Do Not Disturb mode or simply click the ‘Chrome’ menu in the Menu Bar and select the ‘Hide Notifications Icon’ option.\n", "Q: How can iPad battery remain on 100% charge over night? I'd like to know, what is \"wrong\" with iPad batteries (and probably with batteries for all other Apple mobile stuff) in absolutely positive way -- why they're so good in idle mode power consumption?\nMy six years old (!) iPad, charged up to 100% the previous day evening shows -- after whole long night of not being used (screen dimmed off, but WiFi connected) -- again 100% in the morning.\nWhat am I missing here? For past 5-10 years I have been using about 100 different mobile devices from a really significant number of manufacturers (but only this iPad from Apple) and absolutely none of them was able to keep the same battery charge over night.\nTypical idle-mode power drain schemes started from loosing 1% of battery charge per each hour at worst up to 2-3% power drain for whole night at best. But, I have never, ever met another device that when turned on and connected to local WiFi hasn't lost even a single percent of battery charge.\nIt nearly looks like a mythical impossibility. How it is possible that Apple's batteries all able to offer such exclusive performance while the whole world of mobile devices around -- can't? Are these measures true, correct and verifiable?\n\nA: I assume most (if not all) the other devices you refer to were various Android models? If so, how long has it been since you've used a device with a very recent version of Android?\nThe reason I ask is that Apple's iOS has always been more efficient in its battery management. This is why Apple gets away with using batteries of lower mAh ratings. And it's the reason why Google launched Project Volta - because they needed to make Android more efficient at its core.\nIn a nutshell, Project Volta resulted in improved efficiency starting with Android 5.0 Lollipop. It achieved this through a series of optimisations (e.g. a new battery saver mode, job scheduling APIs which restricted certain tasks to only activate over Wi-Fi, and performing tasks in batches to minimise the overall time that internal radios were active.\nOf course, since that time Apple has also made improvements in how iOS manages power consumption.\nHowever, in terms of answering your question Are these measures true, correct and verifiable? when referring to an iPad still displaying 100% after being idle with Wi-Fi activated all night, the only way for you to know that in your exact circumstances is to do some testing, keeping in mind you need to ensure:\n\n\n*\n\n*that you have the exact same apps running during these tests \n\n*all apps (and iOS itself) must be the same version\n\n*the start and end times (and therefore also duration) are identical\n\n*the ambient temperature at the time was identical (in other words, you'd have to do this in the same air-conditioned environment set at the same temperature)\n\n\nIn a nutshell what you would do is something like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully charge the iPad and disconnect it from AC power at 10pm\n\n*At 8am play a movie at full volume and full brightness\n\n*At conclusion of the movie, take note of the battery percentage\n\n*Play the movie again (still at full volume and brightness)\n\n*At conclusion of the movie, take note of the battery percentage again\n\n*Play the movie yet again (still at full volume and brightness)\n\n*At conclusion of the movie, take note of the battery percentage again (assuming you've still got a charge)\n\n\nNow fully charge the iPad and leave it connected to AC power until 8am the next day, at which point you disconnect from power and perform the same test (i.e. same room, same movie, same volume, same brightness, etc).\nCompare the differences in your battery percentage and determine how accurate that 100% reading is.\nI suspect that in reality an iPad will use some battery power overnight with the screen dimmed off and WiFi connected, but that the usage will be quite negligible.\nOnly you can decide, based on your test results, how true, correct and verifiable the measures (i.e. battery charge indicator) are.\n", "Q: Uninstalled apps still appear in settings I have deleted an app with intentions of reinstalling, but when I clicked App Store and searched for the app, instead of showing the option to download it's showing \"open\" as if I still have the app. I've turned my phone off and back on multiple times but it's still there.

The partition type is 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC which is HFS+ (the standard OS X partition type). You can check this by entering sudo gpt -r show disk0.\nIt should be EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 though, which is the GUID for Microsoft basic data partitions (BDP).\nTo change the partition type boot to Internet Recovery Mode or a second boot device (e.g. a thumb drive), remove disk0s4 with gpt and re-add it with the same boundaries (index number, beginning block & size) but a different type.\nUnder certain circumstances - I need the output of sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 and some hexdump results additionally - unallocated disk space between disk0s3 and disk0s4 is required and the beginning block & size have to be modified compared to your current gpt partition table.\n\nBoot to Internet Recovery Mode or a thumb drive with either a full OS X install or an OS X Installer thumb drive. Editing the GUID partition table with gpt requires you to unmount the disk. You can't unmount the disk you are booted to.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (menubar Utilities > Terminal) and enter diskutil list to get an overview. Get the disk identifier of the 500 GB drive - this may be disk0 or disk1. Below I assume it's disk0. Use the disk identifier you have found in your environment though.\nIf you log-in as admin some commands require you to prepend sudo ... executing some commands (e.g. gpt). Booted to an installer thumb drive or to Internet Recovery Mode you are always root user and prepending sudo is not necessary. \n\n*Get the partition table:\ngpt show -r disk0\n\n\n*Unmount the disk\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0\n\n\n*Remove the 4th (falsely typified) partition:\ngpt remove -i 4 disk0\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0\n\n\n*Your hexdump results (\"eb 52 90 4e 54 46 53 20\" is the \"string\" ∂RENTFS(x20)) show that disk0s4 has special NTFS Boot Sectors (which typically occur in the first and the last block of an NTFS volume) in block0 and block 121948143. (x0000000 is byte/block 0 of disk0s4 and xe898fde00 converted with a hex2dec service is byte 62437449216 or 62437449216/512: block 121948143). This shows that there is no gap between disk0s3 and disk0s4 and the size is (121948143 blocks + block0) 121948144 blocks.\n\n*re-add the 4th partition with a proper type but the old other values:\ngpt add -i 4 -b 488722456 -s 121948144 -t EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 disk0\n\n\n*reboot\n\n", "Q: Arrange images on a single A4 page for printing?

For example, we have no idea whether you're talking about an iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc? And which version of iOS or macOS you're running? \nHowever, assuming you're talking about a Mac, you can do exactly what you want with the Photos app (included with Mac OS X 10.10.3 and above) or the earlier iPhoto app included with Mac OS X since January 2002.\nTo do what you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Photos \n\n*Select the photos you'd like to print on your page (e.g. select four photos)\n\n*Go to File > Print (or just do the CommandP keyboard shortcut)\n\n*In the Print page that appears you'll be able to select A4, A5, and other paper sizes\n\n*You can also choose the size of the photos (including custom sizes, contact sheet, standard photo sizes, etc)\n\n*The Columns slider allows you to set how many columns of photos are to be printed on the page\n\n*The Margins slider lets you determine how much of a gap you want between your photos\n\n*You can also set and format captions, choose colour options, and select paper type\n\n\nI'm sure if you have a play with these settings you'll be able to achieve what you want.\nIf you were after something else (e.g. a solution for iPad) or wanted a third party app instead, please improve your original question.\n", "Q: How to fix HDD failure on a MacBook Pro?

Your MacBook Pro (MacBookPro7,1) is a Mid-2010 model which means it's a 7 year old drive (if it hasn't been replaced) which is well beyond the lifespan of spinning hard drives.  At this point, I would recommend upgrading to an SSD and even maxing out the memory for best performance.\nWhile I agree with @klanomath that it could be the SATA cable, it's not the most likely culprit given the age of the laptop and drive.  My money is on a failed hard drive.  However, a replacement SATA cable is fairly inexpensive part to replace and if you decide to go that route, it won't be an expensive investment. \n", "Q: Collect results in for loop when run shell script I try to collect results of \"svn info\" for selected folders by run shell script,like this:\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    svn info $f | tee -a $log_file\ndone\n\nBut it's not work.

However, whether it will run it at its \"fullest potential\" will depend on your specific model. If your MBP has the Radeon R9 M370X graphics card installed (your question doesn't say) then yes it'll take full advantage of this monitor.\nLong answer \nYour MBP supports an HDMI-compatible device, including 4K, while using one Thunderbolt display or can support two Thunderbolt displays not in 4k.\nIn terms of resolution your MBP supports up to 3840x2160 pixels at 30Hz or 4096x2160 pixels at 24Hz (HDMI).\nIf your MBP has the Radeon R9 M370X graphics card installed then it'll support up to 5120x2880 at 60Hz via Thunderbolt.\nThe LG display your looking at has both HDMI and Display Port inputs and provides up to 3840x2160 resolution at 60hz.\nSo, if you do have the Radeon R9 M370X graphics card installed this will be a good choice of display.

Has my iPhone been hacked?\nPart I: The FaceTime Call\nYesterday evening, after turning on Do Not Disturb mode for the night, my phone begin to ring (an incoming FaceTime call) with a ringtone I have never used. The caller was not on my favorites list (so the call should not have made noise since I was on DND). That caller is my co-worker at the office, and claims to have not called me (and indeed his phone has no record of the outgoing call).\nPart II: The Outgoing Text Messages\nToday, I noticed an unsent text to several phone numbers I do not know (and a few I do know, some of my friends) with a political message I do not support. This wasn't me sending it, so what happened?\nPart III: The Suspicious Calendar Events\nAs detailed in this Ask Different thread, I'm having spam calendar events appear as invitations.\nConclusion\nI have no idea what is going on with my iPhone! Have I been hacked? What can I do to resolve this problem with my iPhone?\n\nA: Most likely, your Apple ID was hacked. \nAny device signed in to your Apple ID can send texts, change notification sounds for specific contacts, change contacts phone numbers and more.\nGo to appleid.apple.com to change your password, and change passwords on any sites that you use the same password on, as those are at risk as well.\nIf your password has been changed by the perpetrator, you will most likely have to contact Apple support, as well. \nTo prevent this from happening in the future, I recommend adding two-step verification to your account, so every log in has to be approved via a code on one of your devices or phone numbers.\n", "Q: Force sound's output on speakers A 3.5mm jack broke into my mac's jack input and I can't take it out (we tried for a day, it's absolutely impossible) and because of that my MacBook detects a plugged in audio output. I can't listen music or audio output on my Mac's speakers.\nIs there a way to force the sound to come out from speakers, even while the system detects a plugged in jack?\n\nA: This is a hardware problem, unfortunately.  The problem here is that inside the port there is a \"switch\" that detects whether a jack is plugged in or not and depending if one is, plays audio through the jack or the internal speakers.  \nThe linked article talks about a malfunctining switch/port, but this isn't your case as you described; you have a stuck 3.5mm jack that won't come out so the switch is set to play audio through the port and unfortunately, there's no overriding it.\nThe only other options are to:\n\n\n*\n\n*get a USB DAC (Digital Audio Converter) which is basically a USB soundcard to hook your audio/speakers up to\n\n*take the Mac in for service to have a new audio port soldered on.\n\nA: Someone has had a very similar case\nHeadphone jack broke and got stuck in headphone socket MacBook Pro\nIt was also solved through hardware though may be possible through software if someone knows how.\n\nA: Allan's answer is correct - this is a hardware switch, you can't get the built-in speakers back while that bit is stuck in there.\nHowever, I would like to add a simpler suggestion, since I had this exact same thing happen to me. \nBuy an external USB speaker - these can be gotten very cheaply (though perhaps not for the greatest quality).\nJust plug in the USB speaker, then go to System Preferences > Sound > Output and select the speaker there. You may have to redo this every time you restart the computer, but this worked fine for me with no need for additional ports or soundcards. \nThis also worked for me with a USB headphone jack as well - I used my computer for several months like this with the bit of headphone still stuck in the audio jack. \n", "Q: How do I upgrade an iPhone 4 from iOS 7.1.2 to iOS 8 or 9 I have an iPhone 4 and I need to upgrade from 7.1.2 to iOS 8 or 9.

The list of apps can be found here:\nSettings > Mobile Data > Use Mobile Data For:\nSecond: iMessage sends messages via Cellular Network when Cellular Data or Wifi is not available.

I'm trying to set up calendar events in macOS Sierra's Calendar that repeat every 2,551,440 seconds (which happens to be the synodic period of the Moon).\nUltimately, I want a calendar that provides the Moon rise and set times for my location, and it also needs to list the Lunar phase (e.g. Full Moon, New Moon, etc.). I have found plenty of examples on the Internet where people have manually created the events, but that's incredibly tedious (one event per day for years!), and it's based on different time zones (and so are of no use to me).\nI have seen from the ICS specifications that the file format itself supports events that recur every x seconds. I then exported an event as an ICS file, and then edited the ICS file in TextEdit, but I must've got the code wrong, as it didn't re-import into macOS Calendar with the correct repeat interval. Instead, it imported a single event with no repetition.\nCan someone please explain how to go about doing this?\nI found the RRULE Generator, but that only supports hourly intervals, not seconds, and so is not precise enough for my needs.\nI considered running a bash script to generate the event (which would run as a cron job every 2,551,440 seconds), but that would only give a month's notice. I'd prefer to have it set up indefinitely.\nAnother option may be to write a script in Python to create individual ICS event files; this would also be tedious...\nI understand that this can't be done in Calendar directly; the solution will most likely be manually editing each ICS file to set up the recurrence correctly, and then importing them into Calendar... I just don't know how...\nThanks in advance for any thoughts.\n\nA: I know this won't be the answer you were looking for.\nIn your question you stated: \n\nI then exported an event as an ICS file, and then edited the ICS file in TextEdit, but I must've got the code wrong, as it didn't re-import\n  into macOS Calendar with the correct repeat interval.\n\nUnfortunately you probably didn't get the code wrong. \nWhile you are correct that the ICS specification does indeed support intervals down to the second, the problem is that the default macOS Calendar app doesn't support this (at least not in terms of repeat or recurrence values). So, what you want to do is not possible with the default macOS Calendar app. In fact, the problem you have is twofold, as the Calendar app does not recognise intervals:\n\n\n*\n\n*shorter than a day\n\n*not represented as whole numbers\n\n\nTo explain this further, the first problem above would not necessarily be an issue if the Calendar app accepted a decimal value to enough decimal points, because then you could enter an event that repeated every 29.53 days. \nHowever, even if the app did accept a decimal value, it'd likely be limited to no more than one decimal place, which won't be precise enough when dealing with days. \nUnfortunately, MS Outlook won't work for you either (it doesn't accept anything less than daily intervals and even though you can enter decimal values, it just rounds them up or down).\nAnd Fantastical, while an excellent calendar app for macOS, is as limited as the default calendar in this regard.\nInstead, what you will need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*find a solution that registers intervals shorter than a day, or works with decimal values, or\n\n*download one of the existing astronomical calendars for this purpose and then manually edit the ICS file to change the time zone to suit the various Australian ones you need.\n\n\nSorry this isn't what you were looking for, but maybe the second 'download and edit' option will work for you without too much effort.\n", "Q: Does Chrome consume more energy(battery) versus Safari?

Also, the reality is that the answer to this question may very well be different for different users. \nFor example, some users may only do basic browsing while others may use their browsers for more intensive work/play. It's quite feasible that one browser may be more efficient with some types of browsing, while the other is more efficient with other types of usage.\nAlso, different users will configure their browsers differently, and in some cases the hardware they have will also play a role. As an example, some users may have Chrome configured to use hardware acceleration when available (and it's availability will depend on their hardware).\nThe best way for you to answer this question is to do your own testing with your own hardware and using your browser as you typically would. And it seems from your question that you're already doing this.\nAny responses from users (me included) who share their experiences with these browsers are not necessarily going to apply to your usage.

I have an iPhone 4S with multiple backups in my computer and I'd like to buy a new iPhone.\nCan I connect the new device to the computer and immediately store all the content from the previous iPhone? I want to move all the photos, messages, etc.\n\nA: I would do it through iTunes using the USB cable. iClould is all well and good if you have more storage on there than the paltry 5Gb Apple gives you as standard. I was never able to backup fully everything from my phone to iCloud as it was over 15Gb including all the photos and videos. \nDoing it using iTunes is simple and just takes a little time is all. \n\nA: Just a little FYI... There are some apps that won't be restored from a full backup.  I owned the app 'Music D/L' which let you download MP3 files from a website and listen to them on the phone.  Since it has been removed from the app store, you don't get it back on a restore.  I'm not sure if this applies to every app that gets removed or deleted from the app store.  \n\nA: I would recommend using iCloud as your backup solution.\niCloud backups will restore a new iPhone just like iTunes and do not require the new iPhone to have equal or greater storage capacity. Also you can setup iCloud to backup whenever your iPhone is connected to wifi and power and locked.\nMost of your important is stored in iCloud meaning if your machine is no longer or your iTunes backups are gone, your information is stored securely and you can restore your iPhone just by logging into your iTunes account from any new iPhone.\nGo to Settings > iCloud > Backups and turn it on to get started.\n\nA: Yes, I would do the restore through the iCloud backup feature over a wifi network. The process is very step by step and simple. Do keep in mind that certain things such as purchased ringtones will not transfer from an old phone to a new one. \nCheck out this link:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/ph12521?locale=en_US\n\nA: Yes.\nThe easiest way to do this is to do a full backup of your iPhone 4s via iTunes.\nThen you would connect the new iPhone to iTunes as well and then do a Restore from the iPhone 4s backup to your new iPhone.\nImportant \nThe iPhone 4s was available in various sizes, namely 8GB, 16GB, 32GB and 64GB.

However I encountered DNS problems when going from an internet interface to another (as WiFi to LAN Network) and thought that I needed to restart my OpenVPN daemon with launchctl to fix it.\nBut with this method I need to go to a console, type a monstrous launchctl's command with sudo and, of course, type my admin password.\nCan this typing process be automated?\nEdit\nThanks for @bmike general answer which will open new horizons and @Graham Miln though I'm not fond of AppleScript, but as @Mark requested here's my .plist file :\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>net.openvpnd</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/sbin/openvpn</string>\n        <string>/a/path/to/file.ext</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>SuccessfullExit</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/Library/Logs/ovpnerr.log</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/Library/Logs/ovpn.log</string>\n    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>\n    <dict>\n      <key>PATH</key>\n      <string>/usr/sbin:/another/path</string>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: You could automate this process using AppleScript's do shell script … with administrator privileges command.\ndo shell script \"command\" user name \"username\" password \"pass\" with administrator privileges\n\nThe AppleScript can be saved as an application and launched as needed.\nTo avoid needing to embed administrator credentials within the AppleScript, omit the user name and password parameters. Without these parameters, you will be prompted to enter your credentials each time.\nTo avoid needing to authenticate each time, while also avoiding embedded credentials, you can investigate storing the credentials in your local Keychain and adding your AppleScript application to the Access Control list through Keychain Access.app.\n\nA: The first thing to automate is use a shell alias or write a shell/Python script to cut down the typing. If you choose a script, you could add it to the sudoers file so the admin password isn't needed for that script. \nNext up would be something like fastscripts or LaunchBar apps to use a shortcut key to trigger your script. Apple's automation tools would work too. There are dozens of ways to improve or automate this, but the tools do have a learning curve to use properly. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://xkcd.com/1319/\n\n*https://xkcd.com/1205/\n", "Q: How can I access a specific part of my volumes directory? My antivirus software has told me that a potentially unwanted program called 'Bundlore'has been detected, but to remove it I need to do so manually. It says it's located in /Volumes/Install/Install.app/Contents/MacOS/monetizer \nI've gone into my volumes, but where exactly would I be able to find the software? \n\nA: When you open the 'Finder' application - in the sidebar there is probably an install disk that you can eject (has an eject icon next to the name).\nYou can also open the 'Terminal' program and type in cd /Volumes/ and then ls -la. This gives you a listing of what is in that directory. If it's not in there, you have probably already ejected the install disk.\nAlso - I've looked at the 'Bundalore' program you describe and found a adware removal guide. This goes through every step of finding and removing it. The Safe Mac: Bundlore\nHope this helps!\n\nA: /Volumes/Install/Install.app sounds like an application installer on a .dmg file that you downloaded and opened. If that's the case, you won't be able to delete it from there, as it'll be a read-only file. Just eject the 'Install' volume using the Finder sidebar, and it'll be gone. \nIf you hadn't yet run that application installer, then you probably don't need to worry about it any more.\nIf you have run it, then it's fairly safe to assume that it installed Bundlore on your Mac, along with whatever you were expecting it to install. In that case, follow the instructions that Sidney provided to fully remove it.\n", "Q: Any trick to add photo to empty contact names? Many services (BlaBlaCar, Banks, train companies) send SMS messages with a \"fake\" sender name and empty number, and the new iOS 10 message list is quite boring and difficult to read with the same icon. I've found no ways to save these senders as new contacts and add them a photo. Any ideas??\nUpdate:\nAs you can see in the attached screenshot many services use SMS for notifications and having some graphic icons would be VERY useful to recognize them at a glance - instead of all that \"persons\" icons - but they originate from a completely \"empty\" contact template (no real phone number), if I click on the person icon I don't see any data, so that adding this as a new contact is actually not linked to the SMS anyway.\n\n\nA: Try as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Message app and open a particular SMS.\n\n*Tap Circular Person Icon at the top.\n\n\n*Tap Create New Contact option which will open a page where you can edit contact information and add a photo to the contact as well.\n\n\nThat's how you will be able to save a contact from message app and add a photo as well.\nHowever, I couldn't understand your purpose/scenario quite clearly, so shed some more light onto your problem so that the community can answer your question accurately.\n", "Q: iOS 10: Clear 'Up Next' Queue in Apple Music I like to use Up Next in Apple Music on my iPhone, and sometimes I want to clear its contents to add new music to it.

Without a shell users can never ssh into the mac.\nUsing dscl you can read the 'UserShell'. That is not defined in AD and normally mapped to /bin/bash.\nFor local accounts the command is dscl . list /Users UserShell, for AD you should use something like this dscl . list /Active\\ Directory/domain/All\\ Domains/Users UserShell but I have no AD available to check my syntax.\nYou should get a full list of all users with this command but I cannot check dscl localhost list /Search/Users UserShell\nIf the shell is not defined for AD users, fix this.

The answer to this question provides the same steps, which does not solve my problem.\nBasically, the problem is if you export the calendar, then import the calendar, it will simply import back into the original calendar, giving you no choice to where you want it imported. There is never an option to select a target calendar as described in the previously mentioned steps.\nIs it no longer possible to merge two calendars in macOS Sierra Calendar App? Are there any other ways to do this?\n\nA: Actually, there's an even easier way with Sierra. Toggle the Calendar Sidebar if not already showing. From the Sidebar, select the Calendar you wish to merge into another. Select \"Merge Calendar\" from under the edit menu. Select the calendar you want to merge the Sidebar selected calendar into.\nOne additional note: If the calendar is \"Shared,\" then merge is not available.\n\nA: I just performed the following experiment:\n\n\n*\n\n*created a new calendar, Test, and created one event.\n\n*selected Test and selected File > Export > Export… and saved Test.ics the Desktop.\n\n*Deleted the Test calendar\n\n*From the desktop, dragged and dropped Test.ics to my existing Personal calendar.\n\n\nThe event was imported into that calendar. It did not recreate the Test calendar.\nNote I did not choose File > Import…\nI think this is what you are trying to accomplish. Try it and see?\nI also tried another variation: I clicked File > Import… and selected the file on the desktop. Calendar asked me which Calendar to use when importing my event. I chose the one I wanted and it performed as desired.\n\nA: I was just trying this and discovered that it's now even easier (maybe it's been updated in the last few months?). I made a test calendar with an event, exported it, went to delete the test calendar (Edit > Delete) and it asked me if I wanted to merge it or delete it. If you say merge it just brings up the list of your other calendars so you can choose which to merge it with. \n", "Q: Hard drive not showing up on Mac Mini A1347 I have a Mac Mini A1347 that was wiped out before given to me. It has a 320 GB hard drive but it is not showing up when I attempt to install \"El Capitan\". I am trying to format the partition but it does not even show up. Here is a screenshot I took of the only thing that appears (the bootable usb flash drive with el capitan):\n\nAny help in finding and formatting the 320gb drive in preparation for the \"El Capitan\" install would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\nNote: The screenshot was taken from a separate device.\nUpdate #1\nI exited \"Disk Utility\" and was back at the \"OX X Utilities\" menu.  There I opened up terminal and typed:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nI get back the following message:\n\"No CoreStorage logical volume groups found\"\n\nI don't understand what has happened to the 320 GB hard drive.  It is completely gone.  Could it be a bad hard drive cable on the mini mac?\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem (on an iMac). And no, if the system doesn't see it, you can't do anything to test it. Opening the computer is the way to go. I opened mine and discovered that one of the Sata connectors (my Sata cable had two connectors : data and power) had come lose. It might be something similar, although most probably I'd say disk is toast. \nWhat you can do once you open the computer is put your disk in an external enclosure and test it with another computer to see if it's recognized and properly formatted (even if it's not properly formatted, it should show up, but as long as it's in the enclosure, why not format it correctly if you see it's not). That will save you the trouble of closing the Mac mini after unplugging and plugging the Sata cable on a bad disk. If the disk is fine, check the Sata cable and Sata connectors, and try again. If you computer still doesn't recognize the disk, you probably have a bad Sata cable. Could be a bad Sata connector on the motherboard, but that's unlikely.\n\nA: As the disk is not shown in Disk Utility, as far as the computer is concerned, it's not there. Possible reasons: there is no disk in the system, the hard disk cable is damaged or not connected, the disk is damaged to the point that it's not being recognized.\nIf you visit the ifixit.com site, you'll find instructions about how to open your model of Mac mini and you'll be able to investigate. If the disk is there, try unplugging the cable and then plugging it in again; sometimes reseating a cable is enough to make things happen again.\n", "Q: How do I merge tracks from audiobooks so they are one file instead of 100 separate tracks? Some of my audiobooks download as 1 7-hour long track. Others are in iTunes as 50-100 separate tracks (that sometime get out of order). I would like to merge the tracks so each audiobook appears as one long file/track. How do I do this?\n\nA: I do this in the terminal with ffmpeg.\n\n*\n\n*Install ffmpeg. Download it from https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/, extract the 7z archive, and copy ffmpeg to /usr/local/bin. Alternately, if you use Homebrew or MacPorts, you can brew install ffmpeg or sudo port install ffmpeg, respectively.\n\n*cd into a directory containing all the audiobook segments you want to join together. Make sure the file path does not contain any spaces.\n\n*Run: ffmpeg -safe 0 -f concat -i <(for f in $PWD/*.EXT; do echo \"file '$f'\"; done) -codec copy full.EXT, replacing both instances of \"EXT\" with the file extension used by your audiobook (mp3, m4a, etc).\n\nThis will, of course, not work with DRM'd audiobooks. The same will be true for any tool that does not strip the DRM.\n\nA: I use the software Audiobook Builder to merge single tracks from an audiobook to one file. Afterwards you can delete the originals if you want. You can find the programm in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: You can use online tools. There are several websites like Audio Joiner:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose files to upload. Select which audio files you want to merge.\n\n*Choose the settings for your output file. After selecting the\n    appropriate audios for merging, drag-and-drop them until they are in\n    the desired order. \n\n*Download a single big file.\n\n\n\nI belive this is the most convenient method whithout installing anything nor typing several instructions. It will accept different extensions like wav, ogg, wma, m4a, but depending on your files you will have to convert to MP3 prior to uploading. You can do this on iTunes.\n\nA: I created a free tool (Track Concatenator) to join together iTunes tracks. It uses ffmpeg and mp4v2 to merge files and it adds chapter markers so you can easily skip between the original tracks in the merged file.\nMore information: https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/trackconcat\n", "Q: iPad 4 frequently connects/disconnects from MacBook Pro I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) and an iPad 4.

But why?\nWhat could I do to make this behavior stop?\n\nA: After a broad search, I found this solution which worked for me:\nOn the iPad tap Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy. This will reset your location and privacy settings and require you to set up a trust relationship with the PC/laptop again. \nBut if you are running out of options ... try that and see if it works. I realize this thread is older, but posting this solution here in case it helps other people.\n\nA: This question has a number of helpful answers.

Safe to install from torrent? So, I've upgraded OSX to Sierra, but I need to downgrade (long story), and OSX won't let me because I didn't create a Time Machine backup before upgrading.\nSo I have downloaded the Install OS X El Capitan.app image using BitTorrent.\nI assume Apple are wise enough to digitally sign their OS images, such that this is safe. But I would like to know for certain before proceeding.\n\nA: The original macOS installer apps are not distributed as images (i.e. dmg files). So you won't find a digitally signed macOS Installer.dmg, dmg signing is possible though: How to add codesigning to dmg file in mac.\nHowever, you can check the codesigning of the macOS/OS X Installer.app and the sha sum of the InstallESD.dmg (which contains the files which will be installed to your disk later):\ncodesign -dv --verbose=4 /Volumes/InstallMavericks/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app\n\nand \nshasum /Volumes/InstallMavericks/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg\n\nCompare the shasum result with the following list: Apple Installer Checksums. If the checksum is different the dmg is tampered.\nThe name of the mounted Mavericks.dmg (i.e. InstallMavericks) is just an example - so use the proper path to the macOS/OS X Installer.app.\n\nA: If you purchased/downloaded any version of Mac OS X from 10.7 to 10.11, you can always re-download it from the App Store on your computer.\nAfter doing that, you can even create a bootable USB with the image.\n", "Q: How do I move pictures,music,contacts etc from 5c to a 6s I currently have a 5c which last night I backed up with iCloud in its settings. Today I'm getting a 6s and I want to transfer contacts, photos , iTunes music etc to. Should I take out my current sim and put it in my new phone or can I just log into my iCloud on the new phone and everything will be there? What is the easiest way?\n\nA: Assuming you have a paid iCloud subscription that allowed you enough storage space to backup everything, yes, you can just login to your iCloud on the 6s and restore the backup. If you do not have a paid iCloud account, chances are you don't have enough space (free plan is 5GB) and you will need to do a local backup to a computer using iTunes, then restore also using iTunes. \nContacts are not typically stored on the SIM anymore. It's more so just for cell provider activation and service. \n\nA: If you want to transfer from one iPhone to another, I always do the full backup to the computer (not iCloud) and then restore on the new iPhone. iCloud backups do not backup everything.\nUsing your iCloud login, your Contacts, Calendars, etc. should already by sync'd between your iPhone and the iCloud servers. When you turn on the new iPhone and enter your AppleID/password, those things will automatically be sync'd even before/without you do the restore.\n\nA: Nothing is stored on the SIM, so whether you use your old SIM or a new one won't affect much on the phone. To transfer settings and so on to your new phone, you do need to restore from a backup. The iCloud backup should set up your new phone mostly as your old one is.\nIt's true that if you only use free iCloud with 5 Gb of space, an iCloud backup will be missing some things compared to an iTunes backup. iCloud backs up a list of your apps, and their positions on the home screen, but not the apps themselves or any data associated with them. So, when restoring from an iCloud backup, the phone will re-download all your apps over your Wi-Fi network, so they will come back, but you'll lose your progress in any games, for example.\n", "Q: iPhone backup takes too long I am an Apple User since 1983.

Thanks!\n\nA: How old is your Mac computer (and its internal hard disk)? I ask because hard disks are known to fail over time, so if your hard disk is over 3 years old, it could be that your disk is failing and therefore writing information to the disk could take a really long time.\nFortunately, replacing a hard disk is actually quite easy/straightforward.\n", "Q: How to disassociate AppleID from an old iPhone?

Any help much appreciated. \n\nA: You said you got a replacement because the screen was broken - can I assume that Apple replaced it? If so, did you ask them about the calendar?\nIn any case, I would try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Perform a full backup.\n\n*Perform an iPhone factory reset\n\n*Test your calendars and see if it's still slow.

I bought a new MacBook Pro and began working on it. I saved all my preferences, had some files on here, etc. My old MacBook has USB ports that don't work so I can't transfer files via Time Machine.

I think...\nI actually went into the Energy Preferences and ticked the box, so it looks like the image above...\nIt's worth mentioning, (and something I've only just realised), at the time, I had a couple of web browsers open, one with youtube playing, just as I opened a Word doc in Microsoft Word! I believe this is around when It happened. (Although I had just moved the Laptop back from another desk as I was cleaning too), Possible irrelevant but worth noting.\nAnyway, could Word opening have caused the Macbook to enable/disable graphics switching some how?\nSo basically, my questions are, firstly, does it mean I've just enabled or disabled Automatic Graphics Switching? Secondly, why are the dark pixels flickering green? And thirdly, has it fixed the problem, or is there still a hardware problem somewhere?\n\nA: This is related to the AMD Radeon discrete graphics card. It is a hardware issue.\nI noticed it come up when plugging in an external monitor on my 2011 MacBook Pro 15\" (as it forces the discrete graphics to be used at that time).\nThe only band-aid fix I was able to find was to force the use of the Intel integrated graphics over the AMD Radeon graphics card. I found a handy utility called GfxCardStatus to both show you what graphics card is in use, and also toggle the use of the Intel integrated graphics card. The utility is available at http://gfx.io\nUnfortunately for me in my case, you can't use the integrated graphics card with an external display attached. But at least it gets rid of the green dots in some cases.\n\nA: My machine: 2017 2.9 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Macbook Pro 15\" 16gb 1TB Radeon Pro 560 4 GB, Intel HD Graphics 630 1536 MB; macOS Catalina 10.15.6\nOk I had this exact issue but it was with blue artifacts instead of green. I used your clues to solve the problem!\nI noticed my issue was recent after a ICC color calibration with an X-Rite i1Display on my integrated Color LCD screen. I recalibrated two times and it eventually went away. Then it returned. I found this thread and used the gfx.io utility to control the current graphics card being used. I found the artifacting only showed up when the integrated Intel 630 was used. And I finally realized the issue was the ICC profile must be corrupt as I could literally switch between integrated and Radeon and the artifacts toggled with switching. Maybe it was calibrated while the switching was active and the profiles became corrupt, I'll never know.\nSo to fix, I used the gfx.io app to switch to Intel HD 630 graphics, then recalibrated the color ICC profile with i1Display Profiler software. The resulting new profile had no artifacting or corruption in display. Then tested the new ICC profile by switching between both Intel and Radeon cards, and no issues!\nHope this helps! Thought my graphics chip was going bad.\n\nA: I just had this same thing occur on my iMac's display.  I ended up chatting with a tech rep through the Apple Store app...and he recommended that I \"Reset  NVRAM\"...so I did...and it fixed it.  Hopefully it stays fixed and doesn't become a reoccurring thing.  My iMac is almost 6 years old now, so I'm rather expecting stuff like this to be occurring more frequently going forward.\nSo, yeah...if anybody ends up here in this thread from a google search, try resetting the NVRAM as your first step in the troubleshooting process.  It's a simple first step...and fortunately I had success with it.\n", "Q: I installed a library for programming. How do I remove it? I installed the g2 graphical library on my mac using the terminal for a school assignment and now that I'm done with it I'd like to know how to remove it. Are there like commands I can run on the terminal? Are all the files in one folder and all I have to do is delete that folder?\nI'm very picky when it comes to these things and if I can't delete it I'll probably end up reinstalling the whole OS (I know I'm crazy) so any help is appreciated.  \nAlso if this is not the right place to post this question I'd appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction.  \nThank you!\nEDIT 1:\nI installed the library by following these instructions:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Extract package with gzip -dc g2-xxxx.tar.gz | tar xvf - \n  \n*Run './configure'\n  \n*Run 'make depend'\n  \n*Optionally edit src/g2_config.h to fine-tune g2 behavior (only if\n  you know what are you doing)\n  \n*Run 'make' \n  \n*Run 'make install' or copy libg2.a and g2.h, g2_X11.h, g2_gd.h, and\n  g2_PS.h to the default locations for library and include files. \n  \n*cd to demo directory and  run 'make demo' to compile demo\n  applications\n  \n*To rebuild documentation run 'make doc' (html, PS and pdf manual\n  should be already included into documentation).\n\nEDIT 2: I ran the command suggested by @scottishwildcat in his answer below and got the following output:\n\nMakefile:101: warning: overriding commands for target `libg2.so'\nMakefile:98: warning: ignoring old commands for target `libg2.so'\nmake: *** No rule to make target `uninstall'.  Stop.\n\n\nA: First off, there's likely no harm in leaving the library installed on your system. It doesn't consume any processor or memory resources by itself (though it does take up some small amount of disk storage space).\nMy assumption is that you've installed the g2 library into default locations. According to the g2 website, the following files were installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*libg2.a (may be called libg2.so or libg2.dylib on your particular flavor of OS)\n\n*g2.h\n\n*g2_X11.h\n\n*g2_GIF.h\n\n*g2_PS.h\n\n\nThe first file, the executable code, should've been installed into /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib. The rest — header files for development — should've been installed into /usr/include or /usr/local/include. To 'uninstall' the library, just delete the files in the above list from these paths.\n\nA: So it sounds like you possibly downloaded the tarball from here, unzipped it, then did something like this in the terminal:\n% ./configure\n% make install\n\nDoes that sound about right?\nIf so, the 'proper' way is to go back into the terminal, navigate to the directory in which you ran 'make install', and then run:\n% make uninstall\n\nThat should delete everything that the original 'make install' command installed. If you get some error messages about insufficient permissions, you may need to run 'sudo make uninstall' instead, and enter your account password when prompted. \nIf that works, you can then just delete everything that was created when you unzipped the original source file.\nEDIT: Upon further inspection, it appears that the g2 makefiles do not include an 'uninstall' target, so unfortunately this method won't work. The only alternative I can suggest is to follow the instructions in your question up to and including the 'make install' step again... the output from that command usually lists all the files that it has created, which you can then manually delete.\n", "Q: The application \"Google Chrome\" is not open anymore I can not open external hyper link using Chrome as my default browser.\nExample: if I click a link from Mac Mail nothing happens.

Any ideas of what else I can try? I've contacted Apple but we are yet to find a resolution.\n\nA: This was acknowledged as a bug in macOS Sierra by AppleCare. It appears to have been fixed in the latest macOS 10.12.2 beta.\n", "Q: MacBook startup problems - mouse and keyboard not working at login / stuck on apple logo Today I restarted my Mac after several weeks uptime. After restart, I got the login screen with unresponsive keyboard and mouse. \nRight before this problem I had Aperture open, with a problematic library. I don't know if it's related, I just mention it. I have my Aperture photos on an external disk, which disconnected improperly because the cable disconnected. I tried to reopen Aperture, but it refused, and repairing the library failed several times. That was the time I decided to do a restart, after which this problem appeared. (Update: Aperture seems not related, as this problem has occured another time wihtout using Aperture.)\nI have two accounts on this MacBook (early 2015 13\" retina), so I see two icons for these accounts, with the names under it. Below that I see the following text:\n\nIf you're having a problem entering your password, press andOS. hold thepower buttn on your Mac to shut it down. Then press it agin to start up in the Recovery OS.\n\nThe touchpad is unresponsive (no movement at all), the keyboard doesn't work. I tried pressing TAB, cursor keys, and the first letter of my account name. \nI tried a restart, after which the Mac started into recovery mode. I don't want that. I know the password, and I know that's not the problem. I've had this problem once before, about six weeks ago. Since then I've had some restarts. Back then I couldn't start for one day, and then suddenly it worked. I don't remember what I did to get it working. After that I did one or two restarts, which worked normally.\nSystem information\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Sierra 10.12, latest updates\n\n*early 2015 Mactbook Pro Retina, 13\"\n\n*Base Qi SD-card inserted, which is always connected\n\n*External harddisk was connected \n\n*All disk, including OS disk, are encrypted using FileVault\n\n\nSituations\n\n\n*\n\n*When this happened I tried another boot, which showed a black screen with only the Apple logo on it, for 10 or 20 minutes. I just killed it, and noticed the laptop was very hot at the top of the keyboard, where the function keys are. Near the touchpad temperature is normal. \n\n*I did another boot, and then I see the startup screen with the two accounts. The touchpad does not work, the mouse doesn't move. This is not a hardware problem. \n\n*In recovery mode, the mouse and keyboard work OK. \n\n*After several tries, I could select my account using the tab key. This means I press the key, nothing happens, I try again and then suddenly one account is selected. I did press the S key for the first letter of the username (S), so that might as well be the key that activated this. It's not responsive. I just press a key, wait ten seconds, press another key, hope to see something happen. Then suddenly I get the password field. Entering the pasword is problematic, but I'm going to try. When I start to enter my (long) password, it suddenly fils up with dots faster than I was typing. The password doesn't work, I tried several times.\n\n*I press the power button to kill the machine. Several hours later I tried again. Now it works without a problem. \n\n\nSo while this means the problem is solved, I've had this situation twice now. After leaving the machine off for several hours, it seems to work. I haven't done anything to fix this, apart from leaving the machine of power for several hours. Power adapter was not attached. My gut feeling tells me that this might be a hardware problem, but I don't understand it.\nCan anyone explain this behaviour?\n\nSolutions\nSo far I've seen three \"solutions\" to this problem. See the comments!\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect a USB mouse or keyboard during login. You can disconnect after login. If an external drive is connected during login, disconnect it first. \n\n*Disable Filevault.\n\n*Fresh reinstall; user account can be kept as is, inclusing user library.\n\n\n\nUpdate 1\nThis has happened a third time. Yesterday I shut down the Mac. Today I tried to boot, and this process repeats. I've tried many restarts. When the restore system boots, I can type and the mouse works. I can unlock the disks, so the password is OK. But I don't need to reset the password - I just proved that iw works. So I reboot, then again - no mouse, no keyboard. \nWell, I can press the first letter of my username, and then after a long wait I see that user is selected. Then I can press enter, and I get the password field. I can press one key, wait until I see that one character is entered (one bullet), then press another key. Sometimes nothing happens, so I press the same key again, and after a while you have no idea what is entered and what not. \n\nUpdate 2\nI got it working again. I tried all this without the power adapter connected. After connecting and charging to a full 100% I could start up again. I don't know if it's related, and I'll try to reproduce it. \n\nUpdate 3 - solution (for now)\nDisabling FileVault seems to fix this problem immediately, within seconds. Then I can restart, login, and at that moment the disk still has to be decrypted, so that is not the problem. \n\nUpdate 4 - warning\nSee Password incorrect after enabling FileVault\nDon't re-enable FileVault after disabling it. \nIf you really want to do this, make a good backup first, possibly an image of the disk. \n\nUpdate 5 - Fresh reinstall - it works for now\nI did a fresh reinstall, with Filevault enabled, and it works again. This means the old system library is gone. I kept the user system library, copying it with the rest of the user account. I don't know how long it will last, but I know how to get things working again. \n\nUpdate 6 - Seems like an issue (bug) involving Filevault and USB\nSome comments suggest connecting a USB keyboard or mouse at login, which can be disconnected right after being logged in. One commenter said this only happened when an external drive was connected. Disconnecting it solved the problem for the moment. After connecting it, the problem reappeared. It seems like this is a bug that involves both USB and Filevault.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue. For me this was an issue of FileVault.\nTry disabling FileVault and see if it helps. Also by cleaning the NVRAM the next boot will be OK.\nJudging from forum responses this is a known issue by Apple but no software update or hardware replacement program has been announced to my knowledge.\n\nA: I installed Sierra today and faced the same problem. And yes the solution also worked which is disabling the file vault. \nIn case you are not able to (or facing difficulty) go pass the login screen, just plug in an external mouse and a keyboard. Fortunately, they work fine and this'll help you to go pass the login screen and fix the issue. \n\nA: I get the same problem, with a message to restart in recovery mode, which seems a pain. What I actually do whenever this happens is to plug the magic keyboard into the mac as if recharging - and it works straight away. Once the normal desktop is up, it can be disconnected. Seems like an apple bug to me.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with macOS 10.12.6 on my 2017 iMac. The problem goes away when I disconnected an external USB hard drive (Sabrent enclosure) and returns when I reconnect the drive.\n\nA: Have you tried booting into safe mode when this happens? That will disable any extra kexts etc and clear/rebuild some stuff so might help, if it's a software issue. \nAnyways, to diagnose this properly you need to enable SSH and screen sharing and log in remotely when it happens. Check top, have a look in syslog, and see how the maschine responds to input coming over VNC...\n\nA: I have this problem with an Apple magic mouse (bluetooth) and a generic-ish USB keyboard connected to a 12/24 core \"cheesegrater\" mac pro under 10.12.6:\n\nReboot after ten days or so, then there's no mouse pointer, no keyboard.\n\nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the mac pro from the AC supply\n\n*Wait one minute for system controller to reset\n\n*Plug back in\n\n*Power up using button on front of Mac Pro\n\n*Machine comes up normally\n\n*Log in, mouse and keyboard working fine\n\n\nI hesitate to call this a \"solution\", but it's at least a consistently working hack for me.\nPS: I'm not using filevault.\n\nA: Why not start in the RecoveyPartition. Choose DiskUtility from the Utilities menu, click the FirstAid tab in the latest Sierra it will check and repair disk permissions.\n", "Q: open safemac.co in safari, is it adware?

The device has direct access to my gmail and facebook accounts. Is it possible to disable its network usage remotely, maybe through iTunes or some other Apple service? I'd like to do something such as whenever that particular iPad connects to the Internet it would be either shutdown or disconnected from Internet.\n\nA: Did you have Find My iPad activated via the iCloud settings on your iPad? \nIf so, then you will be able to do any of the following on your iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*locate it on a map\n\n*send a message to it\n\n*play a sound on it\n\n*remotely lock it\n\n*remotely wipe it\n\n\nJust for the record, when you enable iCloud, options 2, 3, 4 and 5 above are automatically enabled. \nIf you have Location Services turned on, Find My iPad can also help you locate your iPad on a map as long as it's connected to the Internet. \nIf you had this activated, or aren't sure if you did, then follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the Find My iPhone app on an iPhone or another iPad or visit icloud.com/find from a computer with a web browser.\n\n*Log in to your iCloud account (this may or may not be the same as your usual Apple ID).\n\n*Once you're logged in, see if your missing iPad is listed under My Devices.\n\n*If it's listed, then that means it's been set up for Find My iPad (a good sign).\n\n*Now, if it's currently connected to the internet, you have two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you had location services activated on the iPad, you should see its location come up.

When it died, it shorted the house's fuse with it. Is there any way that I can wipe out the hard drive (without much effort) before throwing it away?\nOpening the case and removing the hard drive is not an attractive option. I've read an iFixit tear-down and the hard drive is located behind the screen, which requires me to have plenty of tools to remove it.\nNote: there is a similar question with the exception is that my iMac has a Firewire port. I wonder if that makes a difference, since it won't power on in the first place.\nSome movies show a magnet-like device to clear out hard drives. I wonder whether that's doable in real life?\n\nA: Well, if you've totally written off the Mac, including the hard drive, why not just destroy it? \nHammer etc\nI mean, literally destroy it such as taking a hammer to it in the back yard. Then you can just remove the hard drive and destroy that as well. You may want to lay down a sheet or something first, and be sure to wear safety glasses, but this will do the trick. \nExternal enclosure \nAnother advantage of the 'hammer' approach is the option of destroying the outer shell and removing the hard drive and continuing to use it by inserting it inside an appropriate external enclosure.\nBath\nIf you're not keen on the above approach, another option is to fill a bath tub with enough hot water to submerge your iMac. Be sure to mix two (or more) cups of salt in it and place the iMac in it overnight. Then you can just throw it away the next day.\nMagnet\nIn terms of whether using a magnet in real life to scramble your data is doable, you would need a sufficiently strong magnet to achieve the result you want. Ideally you would have to get a hold of a Neodymium magnet, as this will have the strong magnetic fields necessary to erase or scramble the data. \n\nA: I had a 2009 iMac where the power supply went bad.  The glass screen is just held on with magnets.  Just grab on the top edge and pull it off, disconnect wire harness.  The hard drive is right behind it.  Just disconnect hard drive and unbolt.  Not much of any tools required, and easy to do.  Then you can just recycle the rest of the unit if you don't want, and destroy hard drive by opening it and removing the disk platens (that look like silver CDs. Just lightly sand and scratch them up, and no one will ever read them.  Throw them and the drive in the metal recycle.\n", "Q: How is DaisyDisk so fast? DaisyDisk scans my Mac's HD blazing fast compared to, say, du. I'm wondering what's the trick. I suspect it wouldn't be so fast on non-Mac filesystems, but I haven't tried. Any clues?\n\nA: I've never used DaisyDisk, but judging by the video demo on their site, it seems they're using a few tricks to make it fast.\nFirst off, are you sure that du is slower? Try running du / >/dev/null and see if it is any faster than DaisyDisk .. mind you, the filesystem might have been cached after whichever went first for timing purposes, so the second run will have that advantage.\ndu is pretty quick since it just looks at directory entries and reports path and file sizes. The only way you would know what a file is would be to make a guess by the file extension or look at the file to determine its type (e.g. UNIX \"magic\" bytes). The file extension route is fast, examining the file is obviously much slower since you have to pull up the file.\nWith the du output, you could quickly determine the view of the top level directories; you can filter that in code and make a representation as DaisyDisk does and just show sized pie slices. If they drill down into the directories (e.g. /Users) then you repeat the process but only focusing on that level. Since DaisyDisk is only showing you the top 10 or 20 space hogs, it doesn't need to go into details to figure out what the smaller files are (notice it conveniently lumps them into \"Smaller Files 750MB\" or some label). At this point, it still didn't need to dig that deep into the actual files and perhaps if it didn't guess by extension it only had to determine the \"magic\" of a few large files which goes very quick.\nSo what we're probably seeing is that it quickly determined the name, path and size of every file on the drive (as du can demonstrate), but cleverly only showing the top offenders to help you get to what you're interested in since most people won't use a tool like this to get the nit-picky little files; you'll go to the Finder to examine the files if you even bother at that level. There doesn't really appear to be anything special here except that it only needs to examine the file type or content when the user specifically asks for it and the program avoids doing that heavy work most of the time.\nSo what makes DaisyDisk special versus (say) the free \"Grand Perspective\" application for OSX? Slick interface for one (I do like the examine file and drag to collect/delete feature), but also I think GP does examine the files while it scans since it shows everything in its graphical view and colors by file type. You could do the color by type mechanism with a du approach as well, but you're only guessing based on file extension and/or where you found the file.\nAll in all, it is a slick application with a clever interface. Why is it fast? Because they appear to have taken short cuts to avoid heavy lifting until it would absolutely be necessary. For me, I'm fine with Grand Perspective :-)\n\nA: I'm not able to measure any large difference in du or DaisyDisk other than the native app is slower in some cases than the command line tool.\ntime du ~ > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nThe first run of du was 0m7.947s and the second was 0m5.465s and DaisyDisk was about 8 seconds with a stopwatch both times.\nMy guess is you are seeing delays due to screen output of the command line tools measuring more of the disk. Are you using DaisyDisk to scan as administrator?\n\nA: I have noticed that du uses getattrlist() in a single threaded mode. I had found some code that apple open sourced sometime back with the High Sierra release. Daisydisk probably uses getattrlistbulk() with multiple threads, since I noticed a more even CPU core usage.\nOn my Mac, daisydisk is always 2x - 3x faster than du. I have tested this with my home folder of 100G, 20K directories, 350K files. The file system does some caching, so it is better to test this on a cold system, or with a large directory to reduce the caching benefits. \nI found this code snippet helpful for getattrlistbulk -\nhttps://www.snip2code.com/Snippet/526248/A-sample-on-how-to-properly-use-getattrl\nThis snippet still uses a single thread, and the thread was IO bound, my CPU usage was around 35% only. If you somehow spread the work onto multiple threads, I do expect this to be super fast. \n\nA: I'm the developer of DaisyDisk. I'd have to go into lengths to explain how we achieve this on the engineering side, but I can reassure you that the app doesn't make any \"shortcuts\" or \"tricks\". The scanning is real and full. \nAs already mentioned, it's kind of hard to make a precise measurement because of the disk caching. Every experiment will give you a different time, depending on many factors. But it's true that DaisyDisk is by far cry faster than any other disk scanner. This is especially noticeable on SSD drives. Haven't tried to compare it with \"du\" though.\n", "Q: How to add a specific file to Firewall Exceptions list? I have to add /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm to the exception list. I tried to find  and edit com.apple.sharing.firewall.plist but I didn't found such file anywhere. How can I manually add a specific executable to the exception list?\n\nA: I don't have enough rep to comment, so I'll attempt an answer...\nI wanted to comment since I'd like to clarify why you need to add npm - my install of npm (via homebrew) works OK, without poking a hole in the firewall. Obviously YMMV...! But be aware I've not properly tested this with npm (I tested adding npm, and it continued to work fine.)\nI believe you want the application layer firewall. (It's the same firewall you can also access through System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall).\nMy socketfilterfw's API appears to have changed from the one discussed in the linked article. I'd suggest caution, and that you check what the API is for your version before doing anything else:\n/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw -h\n\nMy version of socketfilterfw doesn't have the \"-t\" option mentioned in the linked article so I had to use:\n/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/local/bin/npm\n\n", "Q: CPU stuck at 0.8Ghz on iMac late 2013 2.7Ghz because of kernel_task I know it seems like this question is like the dozens of other questions about CPU overheating and kernel_task overloading it, but nope.\nI found an iMac (yep, found it. In the trash). I fixed it (power board was busted, screen was busted, there was no hard drive). For some reasons that are too long to explain, I ended up with both a SSD and a PCIe SSD. Whatever. I changed the LCD panel with a panel I knew was working, it didn't light up. Obviously, problem was not the LCD panel. Probably lvds connectors, since I already replaced the lvds cable by a new one.\nI installed El Capitan on the PCIe SSD. Other SSD, for the moment, was left alone.\nComputer was unusually slow, so I did a benchmark with geekbench. I got these results: 430 single core, and 1220 multi-core. Usual results for this computer are around 3600 single core and 10 000 multi-core.\nAfter running apple diagnostic, I got errors VFD001 (screen) and PFM006 (SMC controler). Here we go... Fan was going crazy from the beginning, so I had installed macs fan control. People kept telling me it was a firmware issue, but my PCIe SSD was fresh out of an Apple computer, so no reason it shouldn't work.\nChecking the temperatures dgave me normal results (around 90°F for the cores and surroundings).\nActivity monitor told me kernel_task was operating at 230% all the time (sometime it would go up to 500%), and Intel Power Gadget told me the CPU frequency stayed steadily at 0.8Ghz. Except... when the computer would wake up from sleep. Then, kernel_task hadn't already kicked in, and the processor went up to 1.8Ghz (would probably go up more, but with only safari, power gadget and the activity monitor on, why would it).\nAfter some tests (I checked the ram, because why not, I checked both hard drives, I checked the CPU (100% in working order, frequency at 2.7 as should be), I came to the conclusion that the faulty SMC was the culprit.\nBy then, I had long done the SMC reset (one of the first things I tried), PRAM reset, reinstalled el Capitan, installed Mavericks on the second hard-drive, booted on a Yosemite system on a thunderbolt SSD, booted in safe mode, booted on a new admin session... All the basics were covered. I had also gone to the apple store, where the \"genius\" told me I had a screen problem (no kidding) and nothing about the SMC (I watch the diagnostic above his shoulder, and I had already ran my diagnostic, so I expected him to say something about it, but he didn't, he just mentionned that my fan was going crazy, and I told him I fixed the fan problem with a third party software). They didn't give me a paper diagnostic or emailed me anything.\nFrom what I could gather, other people have had the same problems on their iMacs. The solution? Sell the computer. Or come on forums and ask questions about the problem, and disappear. So nobody ever posted a solution about that problem.\nThe \"go into the extension folder and delete the list file corresponding to your computer name\" famous hack so that the kernel_task wouldn't go crazy about the temperature can't work with my computer : iMac14,1, list stops at iMac12,2.

spaces..)\nI also ran the hotkernel script, got the console log, the log of the verbose boot... But all this might be too much information already? I don't know, I wanted to be thorough. I have them uploaded and ready if needed.\nWhat I'd like to know: Is there anything I can do about the PFM006 error (by this, I mean the kernel_task eating up all my CPU) or is this hardware issue something that can't be fixed? I don't really wish to spend anymore time on this computer if the answer ends up being \"you need to change the motherboard\". The Apple Support (level 2) wouln't give me any information on the PFM006 error, because I don't have a proper diagnostic done by an Apple Store (they tried calling the apple store, but the guy over there said I should go and maybe they could see if they still have it and email it to apple. WTF? Anyway... We're waiting on that, a friend is going to the shop today). The very nice lady at the level 2 support told me she was not authorized to tell me what the PFM006 error was without the proper diagnostic. So yeah. Kinda stuck here. But both the guy from support level 1 and the lady from support level 2 implied it didn't look good.\nIs there anything else I can do? From what I could see on the geekbench website, I'm not the only one with these crazy results, and it seems when there's some CPU throttling on this computer, CPU automatically falls down to 0.8Ghz. \nAnd yes, the computer has been cleaned, no dust inside, I checked it. I haven't tried changing the thermal paste because from what I could see, one guy with the same problem did that and it didn't fix the problem, so it seems like a waste of thermal paste and moreover I'd need to buy some. Also, the CPU is at 90°F, which means it's not hot at all, so the thermal paste wouldn't really change that. If the SMC is busted and reporting the highest possible temperature as a matter of security, all the thermal paste in the world wouldn't change it.\nAny clues or advice on the next step(s)? Disassembling the computer and taking back both my SSDs, the perfectly fine RAM, both speakers, my new powerboard and the fine working fan seems like the way to go right now, but maybe some of you have other suggestions I haven't tried yet.\nA friend suggested installing it as a hackintosh, that's an option I might try as a last resort, as I'm not sure it would change anything, but why not.\nThanks! And sorry for the very long post, I really wanted to be thorough, that way you wouldn't have to ask \"did you do that, and that and that\" and lose your time.\nEDIT (1st March 17) : I have more or less left the computer on its own for the last couple of months since I had lots of other stuff to do, but one more thing I tried recently was to start it with a SMC bypass. Of course, I got the fan working like a helicopter, BUT the CPU was at its best, and the computer was crazy fast. No more CPU overload by the system. But of course I didn't leave it like that, I just ran some tests and shut it down, since it would have been damaged from the fan working full power for too long. Too bad I couldn't control the fan from a third party app (I stupidly tried \"SMC fan control\" before realizing why it couldn't work, aahaha, as well as a bunch of others, but they all rely on the SMC for information).\nWhat about my friend's suggestion: installing the computer as a hackintosh with a fake SMC? Does anybody think that could be a solution? I have no idea what I would be getting myself into, I'm in total \"ennemy territory\" here, so I'd rather spend the time disassembling it and selling it for parts than learning how to do that if somebody tells me it's bound to fail.\nThanks!\n\nA: I know this thread is pretty old but firstly I would like to say what an impressive informative post, I am trying not to be too hard on Apple but you are probably far more skilled at fixing iMacs than most apple techs, they are trained to replace parts rather than pin down a fault hence the 'replace the motherboard solution' Apple would come up. \nI run a PC Laptop repair shop and fix many Apple products. I too have an A1418 with exactly the same issue works fine but CPU is maxed out with kernel task. I also have tried everything you mentioned, I could of written this post myself. \nAfter much trouble shooting from what I can figure the problem relates to a fan/hd sensor but I cannot seem to locate where this sensor is. I will keep looking and keep you posted if I find any solution. \n\nA: I stumbled onto this post while researching my (trashcan) Mac Pro 2013 (A1481) with having a low fixed frequency with my Intel E5-2697 v2 (base frequency 2.7ghz, turbo 3.4ghz). I noticed in Cinebench the rendering was super slow and upon opening Intel Power  Gadget, I noticed the CPU frequency was fixed at 1.2ghz.\nThe root cause I discovered:\nI had recently updated from the stock SSD to an NVMe drive using a special adapter however this adapter was not compatible with the default MacOS sleep settings and when the machine would sleep and later proceed into deep sleep (hibernate?), it would  kernel panic and reboot the machine. Sometimes when the machine would come back up, the CPU would be downclocked and fixed at 1.2ghz.\nI ended up having to reset the PRAM to fix it (hold COMMAND+OPTION+P+R on boot until you hear the boot chime) then I got the normal CPU frequency back.\nI then needed to run this commend to make the MacOS  sleep compatible with the adapter:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 autopoweroff 0 standby 0\n", "Q: Why does Notes only show a sub-set of the Share extensions enabled on my Mac? \nI'm really enjoying the new version of Notes.app, now that I can set the text size to something I can read.

The first image above shows the list of apps in my Share menu, as listed in Safari, but in Notes it is a smaller list.\n\nI would like the 'Add to Together' share item to be available to me in Notes.\n\nA: It's up to the individual share extension developer to tell the system which inputs are compatible with their extension, and to then implement the necessary code to be compatible with each.\n", "Q: How come Safari tells me “Safari Passwords are locked”? I recently did a clean install of my Mac (running macOS 10.12.1). After the clean install, I copied over the Library/Keychains folder from my old home directory on my backup drive, to my home directory on my Mac.\nWhen I go to Safari > Preferences > Passwords, it now just says:\n\nSafari Passwords are Locked\nTo unlock Safari passwords, enter the password for the user “Johnny Appleseed”\n\n(It shows my Mac username instead of Johnny Appleseed, but you get the picture.)\nI don’t remember ever creating a password for saved Safari passwords before or after doing the clean install. In fact, I don’t remember using saved passwords in Safari at all. (I use 1Password, so I never felt the need to have Safari save passwords.)\nIs this something to do with iCloud Keychain, and/or my copying over of its Library folder? Or a bug? Or something else?\n\n\nA: Turns out I just had to enter the password for my macOS user account. That showed me the saved password data that Safari had stored (and presumably synced via iCloud), which was mostly records of me clicking on “Never for this website” when asked if I want to save a password.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, but even when I entered my password it did not open it up.  I was also have another problem where when I opened Safari it prompted me with \"Safari would like to access \"Local Items\" keychain  no matter what password I put it, it did not like it. \nHere is what I was able to do to resolve the issue:\nhttps://techraptor.net/content/iron-mac-how-to-get-rid-of-annoying-local-items-keychain-box\n\nA: I had exactly them same problem. I think it has come with the upgrade to OS Sierra. I contacted Apple Support.  \nThe answer was incredibly simple.  \nJust add your normal password that you use when you first enter the Mac and then press the “Enter” key. Hey presto, your passwords are then shown. \nI have suggested to Apple that they provide a “next” button next to the password box and it would save a lot of frustration.\n", "Q: Upgrade RAM MacBook Pro MD101 I have a MacBook Pro MD101 with 2 x 2GB RAM. I want to upgrade to 2 x 4GB but, I don't know where to buy it from? All online shops I've found only sell Corsair PC10666.\nI think I want to upgrade my MacBook Pro to 2 x 8GB with PC12800 (1600 Mhz) so I tried to get Corsaire with PC12800. Can my MacBook Pro support this configuration? I read that officially Apple MD101 only supports a maximum of 4 GB RAM for 1 slot.\n\nA: I assume by Macbook Pro MD101 you mean a Mid-2012 13\" MacBook Pro (MacBookPro9,2) model?\nIf so, while Apple only officially supports a maximum of 8GB RAM, real world tests have proven this model is capable of using 16GB of RAM (and many many people run it with 16GB with no issues). To do this you would install an 8GB chip in each slot.\nNow, as you seem to know, this model has two memory slots and takes 204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM memory chips.\nDepending on your location, you can purchase RAM for this model from:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacSales (United States)\n\n*Flexx (United Kingdom)\n\n*RAM City (Australia)\n\n*Simply Mac (Asia)\n\n\nIf your MacBook Pro is not the Mid-2012 13\" MacBook Pro (MacBookPro9,2) model, please ensure you use the various websites above to identify the memory you need!\n", "Q: Choosing battery replacement for non-retina MacBook Pro Is there any objective comparison of third-party batteries for non-retina MacBook Pro (eg mid-2010)? Alternatively, what are the possible strategies to choose which manufacturer to buy from?\nApple officially stopped supplying spare parts for my MacBook Pro Mid 2010 to its authorized repairers, and AFAIK there is no way to buy genuine Apple parts on the market.\n\nA: I would ensure that you purchase a battery from a reputable online store dealing with Apple products.\nFor example, the following are some well-regarded sites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Sales \n\n*Simply Mac\n\n*RAM City\n\n*Macfixit\nBy buying from a reputable store you'll be sure to get a battery fit for purpose, regardless of manufacturer. Being reputable means they're only going to sell something that works and they'll stand behind the product they sell, regardless of the brand.\n", "Q: How do I enable extended mode with dual monitors in OS X 10.11.6? Equipment: Early 2015 MacBook Pro - Retina 13\" with the Intel Iris 6100 graphics. Two Dell U2414H monitors. One MiniDP to DP cable connecting MBP to monitor #1. DP to DP cable connecting monitor #1 to monitor #2. OS X 10.11.6.\nHistory: According to the specs for the Early 2015 13\" MBPr the laptop is capable of supporting \"Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors.\"\nAccording to Apple Support article HT206587 the video card does \"support multi-stream transport (MST) displays at 60 Hz\".\nAccording to http://www.displayport.org/cables/driving-multiple-displays-from-a-single-displayport-output/ support of MST 1.2 means the laptop should provide \"the ability to stream independent video displays from a single desktop or notebook video output\".\nLastly, according to https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/quick-reference-guide-to-intel-processor-graphics the video card is in fact capable of supporting DisplayPort 1.2.\nProblem: When I connect both monitors to the MBPr and \"Enable 1.2\" on monitor #1, the screen from #1 is mirrored on monitor #2. After doing some research, it appears that I need to change a setting to switch from mirrored mode to extended mode in order to have two different screens. I did Enable 1.2 on monitor #2 as a test but there was no change.\nSupport: I called Apple and was told to call Dell. I called Dell and the tech informed me that it was definitely a problem with the source and explained how on a Dell PC you could switch between mirror and extended modes within the graphics settings. I again called Apple and spoke with a senior advisor. I was first told that it could only be done using Thunderbolt cables. I directed his attention to the support article and said the listed Dell monitors did not have Thunderbolt. I was then told my video card didn't support that feature but explained that he was referencing the AMD Radeon R9 M370X card which is not my card. He said he would escalate the issue.  \nQuestion: How do I enable extended mode?  \n\nA: The first thing you should try is resetting the PRAM/NVRAM.\nResetting your PRAM/NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\nFor good measure, you could also reset your SMC.\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter or power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter doing these resets, try again to use your displays in extended mode. Let us know how you go.\n\nA: MacOS does not support DisplayPort MST which is required for extended desktop on daisy-chained displays.  The hardware supports MST, which has been proven by people installing Windows on Apple hardware and got MST to work.  There is likely nothing wrong with your hardware, so don't try to replace anything to fix this.\nTo get an extended desktop with more than one display on macOS you must have a separate video connection from the Mac to each display, no daisy-chaining.\nI know this question is old but it was bumped to the top by someone or something looking for someone to answer, so I posted an answer.  This question does still come up often though, and it does not appear that Apple will ever add MST support to their OS.  People have been asking for MST for years, don't expect Apple to respond any time soon.\nI speculate that this was an intentional decision by Apple.  Apple caters to a market that is demanding on their hardware but low in technical skill.  Explaining the times when MST is appropriate or not will be difficult if the people hooking up the hardware don't know what \"bandwidth\" means.  It's just easier to say daisy-chaining is not going to work ever than draw the line on when it works and when it does not.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make Finder order on modified at, recursively?

I haven't really used iCloud Drive yet since I'm not a fan of putting my documents on the cloud, but I gave in yesterday and dropped my holiday greeting card spreadsheet on to it from my main desktop (MacPro3,1 running latest Yosemite 10.10.x) so that I could pull it up on my laptop (2010 MacBook running Sierra 10.12.x).\nWent to MacBook, noticed that the file appeared on iCloud Drive, opened it, satisfied. Computer goes to sleep. A few hours later when I'm NOT on a network, I edit the document with no problems and save the update. For the heck of it, I also duplicated the file (well, had to make it a 2016 named file instead of the older 2015 name) so that now the cloud had 2 files. My iPhone 6S running 10.x promptly told me that I had the files as expected and I could view them in the app. My desktop, however, is still blissfully unaware.\nDuring this whole exercise, the MacPro3,1 was never shut down since it acts as a server for the house. The finder window for the iCloud Drive was left open (assuming perhaps an AirDrop-like \"needs to be open\" behavior), but the original 2015 file still has its last modified date of Nov 27th instead of the 29th and also doesn't see the newly created \"2016\" file.\nI haven't rebooted the desktop a bit out of stubbornness and really more the idea that not only should this \"Just Work\" (thanks old Apple campaign), but also curious how long is it going to take for the iCloud driver to figure things out.\nHow long should this take? Any thoughts WHY this is not getting picked up? Is there a way to force a refresh of the Finder window or at least iCloud to convince this thing to get up to date?\nthanks\nUPDATE 2016-12-02: I had left the window opened for a few days and this morning I noticed that it had finally refreshed at some point. Not sure when, but it did. Based on my observation, it was at a minimum 10 hours later.\n\nA: According to this Apple iCloud Drive support page:\n\nI’m editing a document now. When will my changes upload to iCloud?\nWhen you'll see your changes depends on the app you're using. Pages,\n  Numbers, and Keynote upload files to iCloud regularly to make sure you\n  don’t lose any changes. \nOther apps upload your files to iCloud only\n  after you save them to the iCloud Drive folder. To see your saved\n  files on a Mac, go to Finder > iCloud Drive. On your iPhone, iPad, or\n  iPod touch, go to the iCloud Drive app. On a PC with iCloud for\n  Windows, go to File Explorer > iCloud Drive. \nIf you still don't see\n  the latest changes or you see an \"in-progress change\" icon or the\n  iCloud Drive icon in the notification area (system tray), try to save\n  a new document to the iCloud Drive folder.

Automatically creating ranges based on cell contents then conditionally formatting the range I haven't gotten into macro's yet which is why I am asking on here. but I have a spreadsheet that I want to set gradients to a set of diagonal cells but it is very time consuming when you have 60+ columns. I have a template that has the cells numbered diagonally.Here is a small example of the template.\n\n     this goes on currently to 60 both right and down. I can fill in the numbers easily but conditionally formatting them diagonally is going to take a long time. I want to know if there was a way to just select an area and say select all cells in this area that contain the same number and create a defined range named whatever number it is and if that range already exists then add that cell to that existing range. \nExample would be take all cells that contain \"1\" inside range \"main\" then create range \"_1\" and add cells to it. then repeat until all 60 ranges are complete.\nthen I would also need a way to take ranges \"_1\" through \"_60\" and easily add conditionally formatting to them for 3 color gradients to highlight the larger numbers in each range once I remove the numbers and replace with a formula. I might have to do this part manually but it would be alot easier if there were already ranges defined for each diagonal so I don't have to go and select area find cell containing \"5\", define range \"_5\", then conditionally format for each number 1-60(only 60 currently but it may end up being larger)\nexample of what one line with gradient looks like. will have gradient on each diagonal. might end up being 3 different colors to easily differentiate between each diagonal so you can tell at a glance what you are looking for.\n\nI can do the gradients manually after the ranges are made.\nI know this is most likely impossible but I would like to see as I have a quite a few of these to do and don't enjoy spending hours just formatting hundreds of cells manually.\na simplistic overview of what I need is\nfor all cells inside range \"Main\"\nread cell\nif range \"-[cell]\" exists\n    [\n        add cell to range\n    ]\n    else\n    [\n        define range named \"-[cell]\"\n        add cell to range\n    ]  \nonce all cells are in a range I would like something to do the gradients for me. something like \"for each range -1 through -60, do 3 color conditional format\"\nI know there will be alot more to it than that but that is essentialy all I need.\nLet me know if this is impossible. it probably is but there isn't any harm in asking. \n\nA: This is pretty easy in Excel 2016 for Mac.\nSet up your grid and select the range.\n\nDefine your three color conditional coloring to the range.\n\nEnjoy\n\n", "Q: DAM or Document Mgt SW for Mac's in a Adobe CC workflow We currently have unexplained intermittent issues with our Mac OS X clients and permissions on AI, PSD or PDF files that are stored on a Win2K8R2 server using SMB.  All Mac's are joined to AD via Centrify's client, and what seems to be a problem every so often is the user will get a message that the file is locked, or they cannot save it to the network share.  All users are in the same AD group, and that group has WRITE permission on the share.\nBeing that Adobe doesn't officially support their products being saved to Network shares, what do other shops do to work-around this strange limitation.  All sorts of people have posted to various sites about the same issues we encounter, and we can go weeks, if not months with everything working fine, and then we'll have issues for a while.\nHere's Adobe's official stance on saving Illustrator AI files to Network Shares:\nIllustrator support for networks and removable media\nI have some upset users, as this always seems to be an issue when we have a \"hot rush\" job, and this slows things down considerably.  \nMy only thinking is to work with something that saves locally, and syncs back up to the server.  The file share is currently 1TB, and will be 1.5TB soon.  With SSD based Mac's, I can't download the entire share locally to each machine, and have it sync back with the server, so I was looking at DAM software or something similar.\nDoes anyone have any ideas to solve this very painful condition, that seems to come and go when we need to rely on things the most?  \n\nA: I work every day on InDesign CS5 & CS6 documents in real time, stored on GoogleDrive and DropBox to an iMac, Mac Mini and MBAir, all SSD-equipped. My Drive account is provided through my employer, while DropBox is my own personal account.\nWith a fast internet connection, the syncing is invisible. Granted, files are copied locally, but you can define the location of the Drive and DropBox folders to be on external local drives instead of the internal drives if you wish. Both Drive and DropBox allow for selective folder syncing as well, so users can set their machines to sync only what they need to work on.\nFor external disks, I would recommend USB3 & 7200RPM HDDs at a bare minimum, with Thunderbolt and SSDs at the fast end.\nAlternatively, if the task computers can be upgraded with large internal SSDs, that may solve your problem.\n", "Q: How long are deleted text messages saved on the phone after they have been deleted DO they automatically get deleted from the iPhone hardware or iCloud?  The phone is not activated with cellular connection only wifi, does this make a difference.  \n\nA: If you delete a message it will be deleted permanently. \nHardware\nMessages save in the memory. So once you deleted a message or any kind of file, it will be deleted permanently. But there are softwares to recover them and it is possible sometimes. The explanation of that is not suitable here since you have asked a simple question.\niCloud\nIf you have made a backup using iCloud and if the messages you were deleted, existed in that particular moment when that iCloud backup was made, then messages are still in the iCloud. iCloud keeps backups until you run out of iCloud storage. So you can restore those messages from iCloud anytime you want (by restoring entire backup) if those were backed up properly. If you don't need them in iCloud, you have to delete that backup.\n\nA: Here's what Apple has to say about iMessages (which are managed through iCloud).\n\nWe use end-to-end encryption to protect your iMessage and FaceTime\n  conversations across all your devices. With watchOS and iOS, your\n  messages are encrypted on your device so that they can’t be accessed\n  without your passcode. We designed iMessage and FaceTime so that\n  there’s no way for us to decrypt your data when it’s in transit\n  between devices.\n\nYou can find that linked here.\nHardware components and log files on your iPhone: Electronic memory most commonly volatile meaning that it will be wiped during a reboot. Flash Storage is how your device remembers it's operating system, app data etc and that may contain logs with message content but it is most certainly encrypted and anything that apple can support (iMessage / Blue Texts) are encrypted and are incapable of being traced or read by anyone but your devices and the other user's devices. \nRegular Text Messages: Phone companies have policies about what they keep and for what duration, there is unlikely anyway to tell your phone company to stop recording text messages or networking data. This is largely due to government laws that assist police in tracking criminals, however these laws will be different depending on your region of the world. If your username suggests Vancouver Island, Canada, I would contact one of your service providers (Rogers, Bell/Virgin Mobile, Telus etc). \n", "Q: How can I detect which application was started most recently? I have two utility applications.  I would like to detect which of these was run most recently.

For example, choosing to display it as a List will show the most recent app at the top, and choosing the Grid option will display the most recent app at top left, and so on. \nRegardless, the advantage of this over the Apple > Recent Items option is that everything is listed in the order they were run/accessed, instead of being listed in alphabetical order.\n", "Q: Automatically launch Safari with a certain URL the first time the Mac wakes/boots up in a day?

Give a try to find out which program is the best for you to do your task.\n\nA: \n29 Nov backup not visible on the backup list !\n\nTypically, iTunes/iOS update the existing backup, rather than starting a new backup from scratch. That's why the 29 Nov backup is missing, it was incrementally updated to be the 30 Nov backup.\nI work on a tool called Decipher Backup Repair, which focuses on fixing these \"corrupt or not compatible\" (and other) restore error messages so you can restore using iTunes, even encrypted ones :) A lot of errors are repairable, even in encrypted backups.\nThere are a few instances where corrupt encrypted backup data is not recoverable, such as when the encryption keys are lost or incorrect (this was a common problem in iOS 10.0-10.1.1 encrypted backups). Thankfully this was resolved in iOS 10.2 to at least prevent new instances of the problem arising. (If the problem already exists in an old backup, the incremental backups will keep building on the problem.)\n", "Q: How can I open a port (not application) in the macOS Sierra firewall? I am trying to follow up on this thread and to update it for macOS Sierra (and probably all versions since Yosemite). \nIn that thread, a way to open a single port in the OS's firewall was suggested: \nsudo ipfw add 40000 allow tcp from any to any dst-port portnum\n\nHowever, since Yosemite, ipfw was replaced with pf and, unless I am mistaken, pfctl should therefore be used. \nWhat would the above command translate to?\n\nA: To open a port you would use the following line(s):\npass in proto tcp from any to any port 40000\npass in proto tcp from any to any port 80\npass in proto {tcp, udp} from any to any port 53\npass in from any to any port 3601\n\nTo quick-start pf and open a port with one of the lines above use e.g.:\necho \"pass in proto tcp from any to any port 40000\" | sudo pfctl -ef -\n\nTo test the rule(s) use: sudo pfctl -s rules\nAfter a reboot you would have to enter the command again, because pf is not started automatically.\nBy default the pf.conf file has no blocking all rule. So even after starting pf with sudo pfctl -e nothing is blocked.\nIf you don't want to dive deeply into pf/pf.conf/pfctl, I recommend to use a pfctl GUI like the free Murus Lite to configure pf.\n", "Q: How to import notes to iPhone I have an iPhone 6S running 10.1.1 and I have some notes to import to my device.

It cannot keep up with this work and frequently drops frames (in other words, it's not playing it \"smoothly\").\nOS X's QuickTime player seems to be free from this problem, but it's not a solution, since it's limited to a small subset of formats (can't handle 10-bit or 4:2:2 colorspaces, or MKV container, etc.)\nIs there a way to fix that problem (without upgrading to macOS Sierra), or I should look for another video player if VLC's performance is not good enough?\nThe computer is a Retina MacBook Pro with a 2.3 GHz i7 processor and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB dedicated GPU, and OS X version is 10.11.6.

Over the past few months or so, I've noticed that marking a Reminder as complete on either of those devices does not clear the notification on the other, nor does it mark the reminder as complete on the other. I'm not sure why.\nBoth devices are with me and using the same wifi (the vast majority of the time). Handoff is enabled on my iPhone. The Reminders app on both devices syncs to iCloud.\nI can answer calls and texts on my Mac and when I open Safari on iOS, I can access the open tab on my Mac as expected. This makes me think that, generally speaking, Handoff is working as expected, but not for Reminders.\nIs there something else I might be missing?\n\nA: To clarify - Syncing reminders between apple devices is not part of handoff. It is based on iCloud sync only. Handoff is something that happens when your devices are on same WIFI and also use same apple id as primary iCloud account (Concept of primary iCloud account applies to macOS only as it supports multiple iCloud accounts). Calls and messages use Handoff.\nSolution 1\nNow to your problem, you might have multiple apple ids (accounts) on your devices and reminders might be using different apple ids in different devices. \nTo verify on your macOS - \n\n\n*\n\n*Goto System Preferences -> Internet Accounts\n\n*Check the iCloud accounts and make sure the correct iCloud account has reminders enabled.\n\n*If you are using more than one iCloud accounts, then open Reminders app on macOS and check on lists on the left menu for the\niCloud account being used. It would of the format iCloud (<account name>). You could also migrate the reminders to correct iCloud\naccount by drag/drop and then uncheck the unwanted iCloud account\nfor reminders in settings as stated in (1) & (2) above.\n\n\nTo verify on your iPhone - \n\n\n*\n\n*Goto settings -> iCloud\n\n*Make sure reminders is turned on and the account is correct and same as on macOS\n\n\nSolution 2\nToggle reminders in iCloud settings on your devices one by one and see if the sync starts again. The steps to access the settings is same as above.\nHope this helps.\nUpdate: Added second solution of toggling reminders\n", "Q: Calendar Syncing I have several calendars on my mac laptop, Exchange, Yahoo and Google.

I haven't changed any settings.\nThe weird thing is certain appointments on my Exchange calendar show up on my phone but not others.\nOr I'll move appointments on my laptop but it doesn't sync with my phone.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The calendars on your laptop don't sync with your phone but sync to the originating sources and other devices have to poll and update themselves at regular intervals. Only iCloud and probably exchange calendars do a push sync. \nIn either case, the problem for you is NOT that the phone is not syncing with the laptop (it never does), but it is not syncing with the originating server (Yahoo, Exchange, Google etc).

Does anyone know why it does this? \n\n\n\nUPDATE: My iMac has started being glitchy rendering certain pdfs. As advised I'm going to take it back to the store. \n\n\nA: Thanks everyone for your feedback. I called Apple Support who ran a few remote diagnostics and then referred me to my local Apple Store. The guy there booted my iMac as a monitor to another Mac and it still played up so he concluded that there was a problem with the logic board and it's currently being replaced. \n\nA: I just had Sierra installed almost 2 days ago. I have a late 2015 iMac. Happened yesterday that I got a pop up informing me to call a certain number (Which I did not of course) Installed Malwarebytes and ran numerous virus checks using Bit Defender and every scan came up clean. What I did notice yesterday is when I start up my Mac the apple logo lights up red (around the entire logo) for about 10 seconds but then takes me to my log in screen. \nI thought that maybe this had something to do with the pop up that I received prompting me not to shut down my computer and call the number provided. \nEverything is still running smoothly for me. No freeze ups, shut downs, rebooting issues or anything of the like. Still running virus checks and malware checks every several hours with nothing to be found.\nNot sure if it is part of a security boot up check that is part of Sierra or what, but I had never noticed it before either. Will continue to monitor it over the next several days. While I am sure it is nothing, if it bugs me enough or I notice any strange behavior I will just reinstall the o/s to see if that changes anything.\nUpdate Dec 4th 2016\nSo I did some research on some apple forums and a lot of people are experiencing the \"Red\" apple logo at startup. Apple is aware of the issue and are stating it is a cosmetic issue that is being worked on and there should be an update to get rid of it soon. Many of these people tried reinstalling Sierra but the issue is still present.

I used Disk Utility to partition my external drive into four partitions: two in Apple file system (called H1 and H2) and two in FAT (called F1 and F2). However, I found by diskutil list that an Apple_Boot partition called \"Boot OS X\" is automatically created:\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme\n1:                        EFI EFI\n2:          Apple_CoreStorage H1\n3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X\n4:                  Apple_HFS H2\n5:       Microsoft Basic Data F1\n6:       Microsoft Basic Data F2\n\nWhy is there an Apple_Boot partition? Does it mean that now I can boot a Mac using this external drive? But the size of this partition is much smaller than my recovery partition \"Recovery HD\" on the internal drive, so I don't think this is a full copy of the recovery partition.\nI want a \"clean\" partition without introducing Apple_Boot or EFI. (I remember from the old days there was a limit on the number of primary partitions, so having six partitions makes me feel uncomfortable.) To do this, can I use Windows to partition my external disk, and then use my Mac only to format H1 and H2? Can I still use H1 for Time Machine if I do so?\n\nA: You created one HFS partition, and one Core Storage partition, on which an HFS partition resides. The difference is that a Core Storage partition can be encrypted. I've never found a use for the Apple_Boot partition, although it is replaced with the recovery partition when you install OS X. You needn't worry about running out of partitions. The limit is ridiculously high these days. The EFI partition is part of the GUID Partition Table format by default, and should be kept. Neither Apple_Boot nor EFI take up much space, so I'd shy away from deleting them without a good reason.\n\nA: I'm answering my own question here. I found by experiment that Apple_Boot is created after every encrypted HFS+ partition (shown as Apple_CoreStorage). So I think Apple_Boot is an unencrypted partition for mounting or driving the corresponding encrypted partition on certain legacy Apple operating systems.\n", "Q: Connecting an external hard drive to my MacBook Air How do I connect an external hard drive to my MacBook Air? And once it is connected, how do I find it to see what is on my external hard drive? Very new to Apple products.\n\nA: You can connect external Hard Disk Drive to any of the USB ports using standard cable.\n\nAs soon as you connect it, HDD's icon shall appear on your desktop automatically.\n\nA: In Finder Preferences, there is a way to show/hide certain items on the desktop. If you plug in your hard disk and you don't see it, try changing these options.\n\n", "Q: How can I use a USBC DisplayPort monitor with my 12” MacBook and charge at the same time? I was hoping to get an Asus MB169C+ monitor to increase my screen real estate while traveling and working on my 12” MacBook.\nHowever, I'm confused as to how I can charge my MacBook and use the display at the same time? I expect to have it setup for extended periods while traveling and would prefer not to run everything off the battery whenever I want to use the monitor.\nIs this even possible? It seems like I would need some way of splitting power and also the usbc to DisplayPort connection, but continually more concerned at how limiting this single port system is.\n\nA: If you intend to use the Asus MB169C+ while also charging your MacBook, you will need an adaptor, hub, dock, etc.\nHere are some examples for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hub+\n\n*Kadi Port\n\n*Arc Hub\nNOTE: I have not used any of these personally - I have linked to them just to provide some examples of how you can achieve what you want. However, there are many products that will meet your needs varying from cheap to expensive.\n\nA: I just signed up to say that the answer by Monomeeth is almost certainly incorrect.\nThe \"Hub+\" and \"Arc Hub\" definitely will not work because to charge the device, it will need 1x USB-C to MacBook, 1x USB-C to charger, and a third USB-C to connect to the USB-C monitor. They only have 2x USB-C on the adapter.\nThe \"Kadi Port\" might work, but it is highly doubtful, because it has another HDMI port on board. Aside from HDMI requiring active protocol conversion from DisplayPort (adding to cost and complexity), that would also require that there be a DisplayPort MST hub inside, and for the cost, that is highly unlikely.\nI am interested in solving this, because it will allow me to use it with my Galaxy S8 / S8+ on the go without draining its battery.\nI have a heap of USB-C female breakout PCBs that I ordered off Ebay. When I get more time, I will connect four of them together. It will be that the two main ports will be connected together with all pins except power and CC (TX, RX, D+, D-, SBU). The power and CC lines will be connected to their corresponding charging ports. I don't know if it will work, or if it is safe. But I am getting desperate. I cannot believe that not a single company has identified this niche market. I have looked extensively.\nI have solved the problem of how to connect a normal DisplayPort computer without USB-C to the Asus MB169C+ - but it is not pretty. It involves using a Sunix UPD2018, and building an enclosure to power it through the PCIe x1 bus - tested and proof of concept on YouTube. But this does not solve the power problem.\nI am sorry, but to the best of my knowledge, the correct answer is, at least for the time being, that there is no solution.\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: Undo restoring from backup on iPhone I accidentally deleted a downloaded book from iCloud and wanted to restore the book to my phone. So I restored my phone to the last time I synced my phone. In doing so, I have lost all my Apple Watch activity rings data. Is there any way to undo that restore, and bring my phone back to before I restored it? I don't even care about the book anymore. I just want my old activity rings back.\n\nA: Unless you have a backup you made of the data you wish to restore, no, the data is lost.\n", "Q: Open a program in finder with only keyboard If I navigate to a program in my Applications folder in Finder and press enter the program offers to be renamed. Only a double-click with the mouse opens the app.\nHow can I open it with only the keyboard?\n\nA: You can use cmd+O or cmd+↓ to open apps from the keyboard. \nOther way is to use Spotlight cmd+space and type the app name, then hit enter.\n", "Q: How did my iPhone determine the location of Photos when off-line? How did my iPhone determine the location of a Photo when the iPhone was offline and not connected to any wifi? It even determined the location exactly, even though there was no Network.

I have a 256GB SSD which usually sits at around 30GB available space, but recently I've had a problem with what appears to be over zealous caching which has on a number of occasions eaten the entire 30GB.\nLast time it happened my system was grinding to a halt with no space left at all, its amazing what breaks when there's no disk space, so I just deleted the offending files. This caused issues with my Keychain but I managed to recover.\nYesterday I got the warning again, and I was down below 10GB, I'm now sitting at 18GB without deleting anything since, so it seems to be rapidly up and down.\nI've used Disk Inventory X to investigate and the culprit seems to be the folder:\n\n/private/var/folders/l2/khdpc8h92l187pz9yl490fhc0000gn/C/com.apple.WebKit.Plugin.32/fsCachedData\n\nCurrently there's 30,110 files in that folder using up 8.8GB, which seems a little excessive on its own!

I am macOS rookie and now have difficulties with Safari, I would like to find how I can save tabs? \nFor example some tabs were open, than I close Safari and turn off laptop, next time when I turn on laptop and open Safari I would like my tabs restored and open again... \n\nA: Check out the Safari extension SessionRestore. It's similar to SessionBuddy for Chrome. It lets you save a session manually, give it a name, autosave your tabs every so many minutes, and easily restore.\n\nWhat it doesn't appear to do is let you edit an already-saved session the way SessionBuddy does. \n\nA: I have develop this open source Tab Manager for Safari, and I think it's what you need.I hope you like it. All the comments are welcome.\nhttps://github.com/morsamatias/UltraTabSaver\n\nA: To see your entire history, select Show All History on the History menu, or press Cmd-Y.\nTo restore your tabs after each restart, open Preferences from the Safari menu, go to the General tab, and select Safari Opens With All Windows from Last Session.\nThe main advantages to using Safari over Chrome are its better system integration, which you may or may not care about. Examples of this are proper use of the Notification Centre, ability to AirPlay (some) videos from your browser to other AirPlay devices, iCloud password and bookmark syncing between devices, and Handoff when you want to open a page on your Mac, and continue reading it on your iOS device (or vice versa).\nHistorically, Chrome has also been a bit of CPU hog compared to Safari, which ultimately impacts your battery life. I haven't checked recently whether that's still the case.\n\nA: command+q closes safari and all tabs are \"remembered\" so that the next time you reopen safari, those tabs will re-appear. Of course if you close tabs or close all tabs, you can always restore those tabs as described above (under the history section on the toolbar). \nI've noticed that if I close safari by using the red button on the top left, when you reopen, you start of clean. So use command+q to close and keep your tabs for the next reopen. \n\n\n\nThese settings are in System Preferences → General. \n\nA: This blog answers the core part of the question without requiring any extensions.

From what I've read, removing the app from the App Store will not remove the app from the devices of the existing users - and there is no way to tell users to remove it.\nIs there a standard way to tell the users that the app is no longer supported? Should I just send the users a message (in the \"message-box\" feature that our app has)? Should I upload a new version which opens a popup message telling the user that the app is no longer supported - and remove the app from the app store a week later? Will apple review accept such app update, or turn it down claiming that the app is unusable?\nI'm less concerned about the specific mechanics of shutting down which is also discussed here, but I'm looking for customary procedure or examples of how this is done well.\n\nA: Putting a new version on the store is the nicest way I've seen as well as getting the word out.\nSome very well respected examples of this currently are:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://panic.com/blog/the-future-of-status-board/\n\n*http://inessential.com/2016/08/21/last_vesper_update_sync_shutting_down\nIt does depend on your budget and time frame. You can push a metadata only update and ask for expedited review and explain why you'r pushing the update and it should be live in a matter of days - sometimes hours.\nYou'll get a lot of bad reviews, but you were expecting that anyhow unless there's a good migration path for end users to crowd fund or get their data.\nI would then pick a date where no new downloads happen, but give end users 6 months to a year before you pull it entirely from the store. No new sales, clear expectations, options and not yanking the app seem the most gentle and kind way for an arbitrary / general app to close up shop.\n\nA: However you want to notify your users is up to you.  Doing so is not a technical question but more of a choice of whatever's easier/faster/convenient for you.  If you have the ability and desire to notify users before you shut down, my suggestion is to do that.  Users might not be happy with losing use of the app but at least you'll have the respect of knowing that you gave everyone ample notice.  \nThere is no customary procedure because every app and user-base is different.  I would also recommend contacting your users with every method you have available.  If you can popup a message, do that; if you can send an email, do that; if you can post to Twitter/Facebook, do that.  There's no way to overcommunicate an app shutdown.\nThe only thing I would recommend against is creating an app update that just shows a message about the app shutting down.  Users will feel tricked and you'll have a mess and lost of confidence.  \nIf users can still use your app without any further updates from you or without your backend services, let them use it.  Once you remove the app from the App Store, users will not be able to restore it from backup; once it's gone, it's gone.\nUPDATE: Per discussion in the comments to this answer, there appears to be a difference between restores done via iCloud and iTunes. @Hitechcomputergeek points out iTunes can back up actual apps, while iCloud only backs up their data and re-downloads the app itself from the App Store (like if you had first downloaded it).\n", "Q: Sync my husband's Exchange with my iPhone 7 plus I am trying to get my husband's exchange calendar synced with my iphone 7Plus.  Can someone please explain the steps to accomplish this?

So you may want to back up your calendar on your Mac before you do this, just in case.\nOr you could use the free iOS Outlook client.

Increasing the font size system wide isn't possible without setting it specifically for Applications (if you know the menu title) in keyboard shortcuts.

However, I compared the output of that command before and after clearing the NVRAM, and it is identical. Are there more variables in there that can't be seen with the traditional sudo nvram -x -p? If so, can they be seen with another method?\n\nA: In a Terminal type man nvram and press: enter\nYou'll see that the -p option states:\n\nPrint all of the firmware variables.\n\nTherefore whatever it prints, is what's stored in NVRAM.\nThere should not be any hidden variables, however the output for some variables may not be in what's generally considered as human readable format. \n", "Q: What's this CSSM Exception in my macOS 10.12.1 logs? I'm trying to clean up my mac a bit and therefore always check through logs to see what maybe unexpected or otherwise strange. This time I see way too much going on in the logs in terms of lines per second and one thing that catches my eyes quickly is these CSSM exceptions. Here's an example:\nStandard    19:46:21.455829 +0100   syncdefaultsd   CSSM Exception: -2147411889 CSSMERR_CL_UNKNOWN_TAG\n\nIn this case it's from syncdefaultsd but they happen to be from differenct processes every few seconds. I've also seen them from com.apple.iCloudHelper, quicklookd, mdworker, launchservicesd and other macOS native services.\nI found through google that some people posted about them already but didn't get a real answer. Thought I might find someone to help here.\nWithin Minutes i get thousands of these (just captured 10 minutes with nearly 9000 lines of CSSM Exceptions.\n\nA: \nI have found these errors to relate to old keychain data references. I was able to stop most of these CSSM Exceptions from appearing by opening Keychain Access and deleting any empty keychains.\n\nAgreed- my CSSM Exception errors went away when I got rid of some defunct Adobe Air keychain references. The references were particularly defunct, as I had recently deleted the files to which they referred, to get rid of a previous slew of log messages...!\nInterestingly, Keychain Access did not immediately disappear the keychains when I asked it to delete them; I deleted them (I tried both \"Reference only\", and \"Reference and Files\" (even though I'd manually deleted the files...!)), and they remained visible. So I quit and reopened Keychain Access- and they were gone :-) And so were the CSSM log messages :-)\n\nA: This is basically an encryption / validation error. Even thousands of these is not a problem to be solved if you don’t need that specific software calls to be validated for an app to function properly. These can just be safely ignored and logged for most people.\nIn your case, I would narrow down when the syncdefaultsd is having problems by disconnecting from all networks. If it's stuck, you might restart the OS when disconnected from the network and convince yourself that you are not seeing thousands of messages.\nIt's not going to be a significant error load on the system to log messages - it's clearly taking some processing - but I doubt anything less than a million lines a day would be measurable on a portable.\nAs to the direct cause - the iCloud servers to which you are syncing defaults could be messed up or it could be a more local problem where one daemon is passing traffic in a secured / encrypted manner to another subsystem.

This was happening several times a day, which was obviously frustrating.\nI found this thread and deleted a keychain that was empty that I had imported from a previous laptop.\nI believe that what happened was that I imported the keychain from a previous laptop, then I enabled keychain synching in the Apple ID/iCloud settings in preferences.  This must have copied all of the entries from the additional keychain to the iCloud keychain, leaving the imported one empty.\nOnce I deleted the imported keychain, which was empty and then closed and re-opened keychain access to verify that it had been deleted, I didn't have any more problems with excessive CPU utilization from Mail and accountsd and then error message in the consoel relating to CSSMERR_DL_DATASTORE_DOESNOT_EXIST disappeared.\n", "Q: Show my most recently sent message on top in Mac Mail In Mac Mail I'd like to see the most recently sent message - whether it is my reply or the senders email - on top in list preview and also in the detailed view window.

Is there a way to find out the original password, like through rainbow tables?\n\nA: The passwords you find in Keychain Access are not hashed by OS X - you can view the actual password there.\n44 characters could mean a 256 bit hash. If you base64 encode that, it would be 44 characters - with the last character being the equals sign (=).\nHowever, there's no way to conclude which hash algorithm has been used for your password with only the two first starting characters.\nFor finding the original password, you could try various passwords you have used before, and run them through various hashing algoritms to compare. Alternative you could Google the hash or download rainbow tables to test with.\nI would suggest simply trying to use what you think is a hash as the actual password to see if that works.\nYou might also be able to find more information in the documentation for the email client you have used.\n", "Q: Unable to free up any space I am literally unable to free up any space on my iPhone 5S (iOS 10.1.1). I delete apps and photos and emails (when I have enough space to use mail), but it stays saying I have 0KB available. Even if I do delete an app or even 300+ (in one instance) photos, I STILL somehow manage to have no free space. Even if it does free space, it's often not a lot of space and it often runs out very quickly. Does anyone know how to fix this?\nI've also tried turning my phone on and off again. Doesn't do anything either\n\nA: I would recommend backing up your phone using iTunes and then restore using the last backup. This should help in freeing up space, mostly if you do OTA upgrades.\n", "Q: Scripting Terminal Command with Automator I am trying to automate a set of terminal commands.

I use a lot of Ubuntu Gnome 16.10 (Linux). Will the new MBP with TouchBar support the function keys? Specifically, are the 'F1' to 'F12' keys compatible with Ubuntu? I practice a lot of programming (Python, MySQL, TensorFlow) and need these keys to work as they normally would.\n\nA: The Macbook Pro's Touchbar runs software similar to the Apple Watch's WatchOS (I'll call it TouchbarOS), entirely separate from the macOS the computer itself runs on. TouchbarOS automatically switches to standard function keys when the physical keyboard's function key is pressed. \nI can only assume TouchbarOS sends the exact same message when a function key is pressed on the Touchbar than when it is pressed on a physical keyboard, so yes, the standard function keys (though almost definitely nothing else the Touchbar does) should work with Ubuntu.\nFor more on the Touchbar and standard function keys, see this Apple support page.\n\nA: From personal experience, the touch bar goes black when using an unsupported OS.\nI tried installing ubuntu on my 2016 MBP and due to the graphics configuration the grub boot settings needed to be changed. Unfortunately, when I went to press f10 to save the settings, I noticed there was no way to input function key commands. Pressing fn didn't change this. I can only assume that booting into Gnome would be no different.\n", "Q: Setting hostname via scutil When following various guides on using scutil the following would seem to be correct for setting the hostname:\n$sudo scutil –-set HostName doriath\n>\n\nBut as you can see instead of setting the hostname a prompt > is shown: and the hostname is not set.  What is wrong here?  I am on El Capitan.\n\nA: The prompt is the interactive mode of scutil which usually is invoked by the single command scutil without options. To quit the interactive mode enter quit at the prompt.\nIn your case you are simply using the wrong dash: probably the en-dash (UTF-8: U+2013 - e2 80 93) and a normal dash and your whole command is interpreted as scutil only.\nInstead of sudo scutil –-set HostName doriath use sudo scutil --set HostName doriath!\n\nA: Try these additional commands to get your system renamed AND put double quotes around the name in each instance:\nsudo scutil --set ComputerName \"doriath\"\n\nsudo scutil --set HostName \"doriath\"\n\nsudo scutil --set LocalHostName \"doriath\"\n\nThis has worked for me several times. Hope it does for you too.\n", "Q: Finder favorites bar icons not showing I re-installed Google Drive for my mac (OSX Yosemite 10.10.5) and the icon has since disappeared from the favorites bar in the finder. However, the icon shows up in the more info section. What is going on here?\nHere is the view of the Favorites bar in Finder.\n\nAnd here is the more info view that shows the icon.\n\n\nA: This's actually by design since macOS has stopped showing custom icons in recent versions of the OS.\nMy Google Drive icon is also a generic icon, others too:\n\nIf you want to display the Google Drive icon, it wouldn't be possible without third-party software.\nExtra: Dropbox uses a \"hack\" to show its icon in the sidebar as seen in this question, How come Dropbox gets an icon in Finder sidebar?.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro keyboard does not work on startup I'm having this issue since morning. Certain keys on my keyboard don't work when I try to type in my password. A few work and others don't. So I went on safe mode and changed it to no password. \nThe problem is that my keyboard works perfectly once I've logged into my MacBook Pro. I can type this entire paragraph properly but only only the login screen my keys don't work. \nWhat is wrong with my MacBook Pro?\n\nA: I would reset both the System Management Controller and PRAM/NVRAM.\nReset the SMC\nInstructions for resetting your System Management Controller (SMC) will depend on whether your MacBook Pro runs from a built-in battery or a removable battery.\nAs your question doesn't provide the exact model, use the relevant instructions below:\nSMC 1 - For MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nSMC 2 - For MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Disconnect the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer\n\n*Remove the battery\n\n*Press the power button for 5 seconds and release\n\n*Put the battery back in\n\n*Reconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nReset your PRAM/NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this. Here’s how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\nGive these a go and let us know how you go.\n\nA: I figured out the issue, which seemed to occur due to a video game I would have running when I shut the laptop. Because it (the video game) was in fullscreen mode, apparently the cursor and keyboard input were still functioning through the game rather than the login screen.\nPressing Cmd-Tab to cycle windows changed my keyboard/mouse over to the login screen. Even though it wasn't actually visibly changing screens, the cursor would disappear and reappear each time I pressed those keys.\n", "Q: Do MacBook Pros with TouchID contain TPMs? I'm considering a touch bar Macbook Pro, but the majority of the time it will be in Boot Camp. I need to use Bitlocker, so if the machine doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) I need to enter a second password every time going to Windows which is frustrating.\nHistorically, Macs have not included a hardware security (TPM) chip, but the Touch ID sensor requires hardware that serves a similar function. (Apple's name for what a TPM does is \"secure enclave\" and the TouchID sensor comes with one of those) Is that hardware exposed as a TPM to Boot Camp, or will I continue to need to enter Bitlocker passwords on these new MBPs?\n\nA: Apple's iOS secure enclave is almost certainly the \"flavor of TPM\" that is built into the MacBook Pro. I would say it's a very, very long shot that it would be exposed to BootCamp or other virtualization apps, but there is of course hope when you have API for third party apps to get at the fingerprint sensor from macOS.\nYou are correct that this is the first time Apple has included this hardware on the Mac so maybe some time in the future you can expect the functionality you rightly desire. For now, I'd plan on yubikey or manual password entry.\n\nA: It seems very unlikely. The Touch ID sensor's secure enclave is sacrosanct as far as privacy and data protection are concerned, and the original iPhone 5s keynote mentioned that the data transfer between it and the main processor is minimal; as close to a pass/fail response as possible. This would make it quite a task to implement a secondary mode where the secure enclave acts as a TPM, in addition to Apple's reluctance to do so. It's worth noting that there's little hope for this being implemented by a third party as the firmware for the secure enclave, as for iOS, is signed.\nAs the owner of a 15\" 2016 MacBook Pro I can confirm that no TPM shows up in macOS's System Information, but I don't use Bootcamp so can't test that.\n", "Q: Lower Geekbench scores for 15\" MacBook Pro late-2016 versus the 15\" MacBook Pro mid-2014 I've been asked to help troubleshoot why someone's MacBook Pro (late-2016 with Touch Bar) would be producing lower Geekbench results than their MacBook Pro (mid-2014) laptop.\nNow I wish to add upfront that I'm not entirely convinced there is a problem here that needs solving, but this person is convinced there is either a problem or they've just been \"ripped off for buying the latest and greatest Apple laptop that's not as fast as my two-and-a-half year old laptop\".\nHere are the specs and Geekbench v4 results...\nMacBook Pro (15\" Retina mid-2014)\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Sierra 10.12.1\n\n*MacBookPro11,3\n\n*Intel Core i7-4870HQ\n\n*2.5GHz\n\n*16GB RAM\n\n*256GB SSD\n\n*Single-Core Score: 4,236\n\n*Multi-Core Score: 13,971\nMacBook Pro (15\" Late 2016) with Touch Bar\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Sierra 10.12.1\n\n*MacBookPro13,3\n\n*Intel Core i7-6820HQ\n\n*2.9GHz\n\n*16GB RAM\n\n*512GB SSD\n\n*Single-Core Score: 4,526\n\n*Multi-Core Score: 13,792\nAs you can see, the Single-Core score is better for the current model, but the Multi-Core Score is worse. However, this person seems fixated on the fact the Multi-Core Score is lower for his new toy, and the fact that both scores are so close to one another (he feels the current model should be quite a bit higher on both scores).\nI have confirmed he's running the same version of Geekbench on both machines, and that in both instances the tests were run from a fresh boot of the system.\nIn terms of the older MacBook Pro, this has a lot 3rd Party software installed (e.g. MS Office 2011, Adobe Creative Suite CS6, Parallels Desktop 12, various browsers, etc).\nSince he's running the same OS on both machines, and because his new MacBook Pro still only has the default apps installed (i.e. Geekbench v4 is the only 3rd party software he's installed), I'm not really sure what to make of this. As I stated at the outset, I'm not convinced there is a problem here, but I have to admit I am a little sympathetic to his concerns.\nI did suggest the real test would be to install Adobe Creative Suite on the new machine and perform an identical workflow using Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign on both machines and timing the results. But he is adamant on not installing anything else so Apple can't use it as an excuse for the lower scores.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*What troubleshooting steps would I do in the case of a brand new\ncomputer running the latest OS with no 3rd party software installed\n(except for Geekbench itself)?\n\n*If none, do I reassure him or does he try escalating it with Apple?\nAre there useful resources I can refer him to that would explain this and\nperhaps put his mind at ease?\n\nA: The scores does not seem to indicate a problem with the specific MacBook Pro in question. Nor does it imply potential for a class action suit, as you indicate in the comments.\nIf you look at Apple's marketing for the MacBook Pro they stress that it has:\n\n\n*\n\n*Up to 130% faster graphics\n\n*Up to 100% faster flash storage\n\n\nNone of these things are measured by Geekbench.\nNote that Apple's marketing site does not say that CPU is a specific amount faster than previous MacBook Pro models. Therefore I do not see anything that should elicit a class action lawsuit.\nAlso the CPU choices are not exactly a secret. You can look up the CPU models and confirm third party benchmarks before making a purchasing decision on a MacBook Pro.\nNow that has been said - please remember that Geekbench is just an artificial benchmark. The performance you experience in using the Mac is not always reflected in such an artificial benchmark.\nWhen comparing the two setups remember that:\nA) The 2014 MacBook Pro you mention is not the base model - it is a build-to-order model with a better than standard CPU. The 2016 MacBook Pro in your question is the base model.\nB) The 6820HQ CPU has considerably larger memory bandwidth.\nC) The 6820HQ CPU has 8 MB of cache compared to 6 MB on the 4870HQ. This doesn't really make a difference for artificial benchmarks testing integer or floating point performance - but it can make a huge difference in real life situations.\nD) The 6820HQ CPU uses less power for the same workload as compared to the 4870HQ. Consuming less power allows for less battery weight (lighter laptop).\nE) The integrated graphics on the 6820HQ CPU is considerably faster than the integrated graphics on the 4870HQ.\n", "Q: Clone all of an iPhone's data I'm looking for a way to copy all of the data from my iPhone to a Windows PC, with accuracy down to the byte that could be used for forensic purposes. The iPhone in question is an iPhone 6 running iOS 9.3 and is not jailbroken.\nIs there any software (the cost of which is not important) that would do just that? Basically, I'm wondering how the FBI did it.\nThe output file is NOT important. Even if it's all encrypted, it's ok—it just must be every single byte that can be taken off the phone (a complete copy of the iPhone's hard disk).\nCould iTunes do this based on the presumption that nothing is left behind when iTunes+Windows makes an iPhone backup?\n\nA: In a sense there are multiple answers to your question.\nLaw Enforcement\nYou asked how the FBI did it. In a nutshell you won't get an answer here as they paid a huge sum of money to obtain the vulnerability, which in itself only applied to a particular model of iPhone running a specific version of iOS. So the approach the FBI used most likely wouldn't work for you, but even if it did, no-one is going to be able to tell you how they did it.\nLaw enforcement also uses a tool developed by Zdziarski five or so years back, however current versions are not available to the public. Even if you could source one of the earlier versions originally available to the public, this is not likely to work with iOS 9.3.\nForensic options\nThere are a number of forensic options available, none of which are cheap. However, since you stated that the cost isn't important, here's a few you may find of interest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lantern 4 - US$1,999 up front, US$800 annual maintenance\n\n*Spotlight - US$2,000 up front, plus the cost of compulsory training\n\n*UFED - There are a whole range of options/versions available\n\n\n'Disk Image'\nOnce you have your disk image of the iPhone you will need analysis tools that are capable of connecting to and analysing a mounted iOS image. In your case you're likely to find that some of the open source community tools are powerful enough for a search and retrieval investigation. Here is a list of some of these tools for you to research:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scalpel\n\n*DD\n\n*Find\n\n*Stings\n\n\niTunes backups\nIn terms of whether iTunes will perform a full bit-by-bit backup, the answer is no. Even selecting the \"Encrypt local backup\" option will not result in a full backup, although it will capture account passwords, Health data, HomeKit data and various other additional files not usually included in the backup.\n", "Q: Lost SMS/Txt Msgs on iPhone I seem to have lost the SMS/TXT messages on my iPhone 6 128GB (iOS 9.3). This iPhone is not jailbroken. I have the passcode. It's close to full with only about 3GB of storage left.\nSuddenly, a few days ago, I realized that about 75-80% of my SMS/txt message conversations had disappeared. \nThis is a big problem for me as it may look real bad in an upcoming divorce.\nCan anyone shed ideas on how I can recover these? What about my iTunes backup? (I can decrypt output). Anything else I can try?\nI've also had on this iPhone a problem with lots of photos/videos disappearing, too (when the iOS update added the separate \"Screenshots\" photo album (I have many screenshots)\n\nA: Are you sure your SMS/Text Messages are gone? Assuming you have iOS configured to keep them, they should be there.\nIf you're not sure, here is how to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on your iPhone Settings\n\n*Swipe up until you see the Messages option\n\n*Tap on Messages\n\n*Swipe up until you see the Keep Messages option. This should show either 30 Days, 1 Year, or Forever.\n\n\nIf it shows Forever you should be okay. Likewise, if it shows 1 Year you may be okay depending on how far back you need to go. However, if it's only set at 30 Days then you're going to be out of luck unless you have backups for the period you need (which you may do if you have a good backup regime in place).\nIn terms of accessing past messages, may people don't realise they can do this quite easily by using the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Messages\n\n*Tap on your spouse's name\n\n*When the messages appear, tap at the top centre of the screen to load more messages. \n\n\nNOTE: It's easiest to tap where the Time is displayed. Each time you do this more messages will load. Depending on how far back you want to go, you may need to tap many times to load them all.\n", "Q: Replace Apple RAID with larger disks I have a pair of 500 GB disks that are mirrored in a Mac.\nI want to replace them with a pair of 4 TB disks.  Would the following process work?\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn power off.\n\n*Remove one of the small pair.\n\n*Replace it with a 4 TB drive. RAID will appear degraded.\n\n*Using Disk Utility add the new drive to the RAID.\n\n*Allow it to rebuild.\n\n*Go have serious coffee.  \n\n*Shut down computer.\n\n*Replace 2nd small drive.\n\n*Boot the computer, rebuild the raid.\n\n*At this point I think I should have a RAID with a 500 GB partition and 3.5 TB of free space.\n\n*Grow the file system to fill the disk.\n\n\nWill this work?  Am I missing any details?\nUncertainties:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Disk Utility or diskutil expand a RAID file system that doesn't fill the disk?\n\n\nA: RAID sets can't be resized wth Disk Utility.  Here's what works best, if you have a large number of files to move to the new array (e.g., a Time Machine archive, which can have millions of tiny, individual files.)\nNote that you'll need a third drive to boot from, if your RAID array is also your boot drive.  A MacOS install DVD or USB stick will do, since they enable running Disk Utility.  You will also need at least one external dock or enclosure, for at least one of your old RAID drives.\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the new drives as Journaled, case-sensitive, not encrypted.\n\n*Partition the drives, if desired.\n\n*Call up the RAID Assistant within Disk Utililty.  Create an new mirrored set with the new drives, or with size-matched partitions on the drives.  You can leave non-RAIDed partitions on each drive, and/or create multiple RAID sets from multiple matching partitions.  (This is very useful if you have virtual machines, or large movie files that are static and don't generate new versions over time.)\nNB: Because a VM is \"new\" to Time Machine every time you use it, \n   it will give rise to multiple 30-50GB archived versions that \n   will very quickly eat into the available Time Machine storage \n   space.  It's best to exclude VMs from backup in Time Machine's \n   preferences, and back them up manually in their own separate \n   partition. \n   Another use for a separate partition is to hold a bootable clone\n   of your startup HD (Carbon Copy Cloner is good for this.)  If the \n   startup drive fails, the clone lets you reboot and carry on within\n   minutes (and keep operating until your replacement drive arrives.)\n\n*Mount at least one of your old RAID drives in an external dock or enclosure.  \n\n*Here's the key step: In the left pane of Disk Utility, select from \"RAID Sets\" your desired target RAID, then click the \"Restore\" button.  Select the source volume on the old RAID drive that you want copied to the new RAID set, and let the restore proceed.  It may take many hours, but that's far better than the many days that Finder would require.\n", "Q: Is there a quad-core configuration of the 13'' MacBook Pro 2016? Is there a quad-core configuration of the 13 in MacBook Pro 2016 model? There is a quad core option for 15 inch, but I can't find one for 13 inch.\n\nA: Nope, according to Apple's website. 13\" model doesn't have quad-core model(don't know why, always wanted that option), not even build to order ones. It is 15\" exclusive.\n\nA: In the sense of a real quad core, no. \nHowever, it is worth noting that all possible CPU configurations do support Turbo Boost 2.0 and Hyper Threading. Hyper-threading will be of more interest to you.\nHere is a brief summary of both:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turbo Boost 2.0 automatically increases the speed of the active cores to improve performance when needed. Depending on the actual configuration, this boost will range from a boost of 3.3GHz up to 3.6GHz). You can read more about this here. You can also disable and enable Turbo Boost at will.\n\n*Hyper Threading allows the system to recognize four total cores (two real and two virtual). You can also read more about Hyper-Threading.\n\n", "Q: What services on macOS might leak identifiable information? I'm looking to make a set of firewall rules in macOS for use on untrusted networks, such that no identifiable information, such as account or device identifiers, might be inadvertently leaked.\nmacOS/Darwin not being my home operating system, I'm not sure which, if any, of the background services might leak such information in the cleartext. I'm particularly interested in cloudd, Handover, AirDrop and those services which would likely identify themselves to the network in some manner.\nI've been unable to find existing guides for hardening macOS in this manner, but am happy to be directed to one if it exists.\n\nA: I recently began researching issues related to hardening macOS 10.12. Fortunately I found a thorough \"practical guide to securing macOS\" on Github. The macOS Security and Privacy Guide (a 56-Page PDF) covers multiple macOS security topics, including application level firewalls; kernel level packet filtering (pfctl); background services (managed by launchd); system daemons; DNS variables; and many, many others. \nWith regard to your specific question, this \"hardening guide\" should be a useful resource for an evaluation of background services that might leak PII or other sensitive data. (The section on Spotlight Suggestions was certainly an eye-opener for me).

I don't need to know what my family is doing when I ask about my own meetings:\n\n\nHow can I hide some calendars from Siri?\n\nA: Short answer: No. \nNo, at this moment it is not possible to hide calendars from Siri. I highly recommend you send this feedback to Apple. \nA workaround would be to use a second calendar app to show the calendars of your family and use the normal calendar app only for your own calendars. \n\nA: Siri seems to show exactly those events, which are in one of the enabled calendars in the calendar app from apple. So if a calendar is not visible in the app, its not visible to siri either and vice versa.\nIf you use a second calendar app as your daily driver, you can therefore use the following workaround.\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup the calendars in apples calendar app, the way you want Siri to use them.\n\n*Activate different calendars in your third party calendar app as needed.\n\n", "Q: Can you turn off the (the lighting) of the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros?

Tap the option to switch the location the home button sends you to. Since Apple TV automatically sets it to TV app after updating, you just need to press once to restore normal behavior, and again to switch to launching the TV app when the home button is pressed.\n", "Q: How do I take screenshots of the Touch Bar? How do you take a screenshot of the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros? \nSpecifically, I need a way to take a picture similar to using Grab or the shortcut Cmd+Shift+3.\n\nA: You could use Touch Bar Simulator, a tool I made, which has a screenshot capture button. This works even if your Mac doesn't have a Touch Bar.\n(Camera icon on the top-right)\n\n\nA: From this article by OS X Daily:\n\nThe new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has replaced the standard Escape and Function keys with a little dynamically changing screen called the Touch Bar. Some Mac users may wish to take a screenshot of the Touch Bar, perhaps for developing, testing, or sharing purposes, similar to screenshotting displays on any other Mac or iOS device.\nThere are two different keyboard shortcuts to capture screen shots of Touch Bar on a Mac. One saves the Touch Bar screenshot as a file on the desktop, and the other copies a picture of the Touch Bar to the Mac clipboard instead. You can also take screenshots of the Touch Bar with the Grab application in Mac OS.\nTake a Screen Shot of Touch Bar as a File on Mac\nCommand + Shift + 6\nThe Touch Bar screenshot will appear on the desktop like any other screen shot would.\nCopy a Screen Shot of Touch Bar to Clipboard on Mac\nControl + Command + Shift + 6\nThe Touch Bar screenshot will be copied to the clipboard, which can then be pasted elsewhere as needed. This functions like a Touch Bar specific version of Print Screen in that the picture is not saved as a file but instead goes to the clipboard, a bit like Command+Shift+Control+3 on Mac.\n\nThe “Grab” app also supports taking screenshots of Touch Bar, if you prefer to use Grab rather than the standard Mac OS keystrokes for snapping screenshots. Grab is found in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder.\nAnother option would be to run a virtual Touch Bar with an app like Touche or Touch Bar Demo and then screenshot the Mac directly, but that’s more work than necessary for most users with a Touch Bar, though it would be the only way to snap a Touch Bar screen shot for Mac users without a Touch Bar on their keyboard.\n\n", "Q: Is it useful to upgrade MacBook Pro to 16GB RAM? How does an additional 8GB of RAM impact performance for the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro? \nIt is used for graphic-heavy apps — Sketch, Design, Photo and image editing and to power a LG 21\" display.\nDoes the additional RAM help improve display performance or does more RAM mean apps will not run out of memory? \n\nA: With the GPU - the extra RAM won't make any graphics faster in my opinion. Running \"out\" of memory isn't something that virtual memory allows - and when you start to get under memory pressure the apps can release memory to the system and the system starts to slow down as memory swaps. At some point, performance suffers - but I'm having a hard time justifying cases where 16 GB of RAM is the \"straw that breaks the performance camel's back\".\nI'm in the process of evaluating this for our company. Traditionally we have predominantly maxed out memory in our MacBook Pro fleet, but I'm probably going to split our orders 50 / 50 to see if we really need 16 GB RAM for our pro users.\nEven our photo department processing 50 to 100 megapixel images in Capture One or Lightroom - we're struggling to justify more than 8 GB of RAM.\nOnce we have about 10 of each model, we will re-measure the RAM needs. My suspicion is we're being overly cautious and could go 90% smaller RAM and 10% larger RAM.\nThe reasons for this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The apps we need just aren't RAM hungry with the better frameworks and memory management on macOS.\n\n*The penalty of swapping to the NVMe based SSD is no longer a deal breaker for people that only occasionally push their Macs into memory pressure makes this a slight slowdown as opposed to a crawl when swapping used to hit HDD storage.\n\n*Statistically - our fleet of Macs just doesn't enter memory pressure. \n\n\nBasically, when our developers and designers are waiting - it's for file transfer, for network and the machines aren't the bottleneck to productive work. Yes - I can benchmark situations where I can exhaust memory, but in practice - people in that situation know they have too many other chrome tabs open, or outlook has hung on them or there is a memory leak and they can log out and clear that issue for days to come.\nUnless you 100% know you have to run multiple OS at the same time, are a heavy windows user (we have some that allocate 4 to 6 GB of RAM to a PC and still work fine with 8 GB of RAM! on the Mac) the chance that you need 16 GB of RAM is slim. I would advise most people to spend that extra $$ on AppleCare or on new software or on books and training to make you more efficient rather than being \"safe\" with the maxed out RAM.\n", "Q: How to change my phone number on Facetime and iMessage?

Is there any way to disable that notification, or at least tun off the sound for that one without completely muting the watch?\n\nA: There isn't a way to disable the sound without disabling all notification sounds, as you've already discovered.\nI would recommend leaving feedback for Apple here and let them know what new features you'd like to have added to the watch.

As new the new MacBook Pros have just launched, the prices are quite high. Last evening I visited a store and found out the 15\" mid-2015 model is cheaper than the 13\" late-2016 (Touch Bar) model. As I do lot of software development work, and use Xcode and Android Studio, along with localhost server work, I just wanted to know if the 15\" will handle this type of world well? Sometimes I also do movie editing and steam gaming too.\nI would be using the new laptop for a minimum of 3 years.\nModels:\n\n\n*\n\n*13-inch (2016)\n\n*Intel Core i5-6267U @ 2.9 GHz\n\n*512GB HD\n\n*8GB RAM (2133 MHz)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*15-inch (2015)\n\n*Intel Core i7-4870HQ @ 2.50 GHz \n\n*512GB HD\n\n*16GB RAM (1600 MHz)\n\n\nA: This really gets down to personal preference and in that sense your question will invite people to express opinions, rather than providing an answer to a problem.\nThe best way for you (and I dare say anyone) to make a decision is to identify what are the most important requirements for your intended use. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU - The 15\" mid-2015 MacBook Pro has a 4 core processor, while the 13\" late-2016 MacBook Pro only has a 2 core processor, so if processing power is critical the mid-2015 model is a better choice.\n\n*Battery - The 13\" late-2016 MacBook Pro, by virtue of its smaller screen size, will run longer on battery than the 15\" mid-2015 MacBook Pro, so if running on battery power is critical, the 13\" model is a better choice.\n\n*RAM - The 13\" late-2016 MacBook Pro you're considering has 8GB RAM, while the 15\" mid-2015 MacBook Pro has 16GB RAM, so if the apps you run are memory hungry, then the mid-2015 model is a better choice.\n\n*Display - The 15\" mid-2015 MacBook Pro has a 15\" screen (obviously) which has a native resolution of 2880x1800 pixels, while the 13\" late-2016 MacBook Pro only has a 13\" screen 2560x1600 pixels, so if the amount of desktop real estate is critical the mid-2015 model is a better choice.\n\n*Weight - The 15\" mid-2015 MacBook Pro weighs 2.04Kg while the 13\" late-2016 MacBook Pro weighs 1.37Kg, so if you're going to be carrying it around a lot, then the 13\" model is a better choice.\n\n*Ports - It's well documented that the 13\" late-2016 MacBook Pro has four USB-C ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The mid-2015 model on the other hand has two USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, an HDMI port, an audio in/out port, and an SDXC card slot. Only you can decide which one is a better choice for the next three years!\n\n\nYou get the idea.

In this link, there is the unix command \n$HOME/.matlab/<version>/matlab.prf.\n\nHow to go to this place by using terminal?\n\nA: $HOME is your home directory.  This is the directory you are in when you start a terminal window.  Normal using on Mac (and most unix-like systems, is that your home directory has the same name as your short user name.  So if you are Mike Smith, and have a short user name of msmith then the value of $HOME is (usually) /Volumes/Users/msmith.\nHOME is an environment variable. If I create a script or a set of directions and use $HOME instead of /Volumes/Users/msmith, then that script can be used by other people.  When I log in, during the startup process MY HOME variable is set to /Volumes/Users/sherwood.\nThe < > notation means, \"Don't type this literally, but find out what the value is, and use that instead.  No automatic substitution this time.\nIn general on Mac and UNIX/Linux/*BSD systems a file in your home directory (possibly other places) that starts with a period contains settings for that software package.  So .matlab is a directory of Matlab settings, startup scripts, this and that.\n<version> is replaced by the version number of your Matlab installation.  You may have several different Matlab versions.\nThe easiest way to find this is by typing \nls .matlab\n\nIn your home directory.  I don't have Matlab on my Mac, so I'm only guessing, but you will probably see something like R2009b and/or R2011a.\nSo if your username was msmith, you could refer to this file as \n~/.matlab/R2011a/matlab.prf\n\nThe ~ is another shorthand meaning the 'home directory of'. Often you can just use ~ by itself.  As ~/.matlab.  ~/.matlab and $HOME/.matlab are two ways of saying the same thing.  \nIf you need to GO there -- to see what else is in that directory, just chop off everything after the last / and put cd in front.\nThus \ncd ~/.matlab/R2011a/\n\nwill leave you in the folder containing matlab.prf\n\nThe default settings folder in newer MatLAB versions seems to be $HOME/Library/Application Support/MathWorks/MATLAB/version/ though:\nthe path to matlab.prf is then e.g. \n\"$HOME/Library/Application Support/MathWorks/MATLAB/R2016b/matlab.prf\"\n\n", "Q: Create bootable USB with multiple installers?

When I select an ISO, I want it to boot from that ISO on the thumb drive. Simple as that.\nI have a 2011 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.12. What do I need to do to accomplish this task?\n\nA: I'll answer each of your questions separately:\nAll on one partition\nNot possible with the current state of technology. Apple's startup systems look for bootable partitions, not images.

I get No manual entry for readline.\nHowto view the manual with man readline?\n\nA: The -M option for man allows you to specify a path. The exact command you're looking for is:\nman -M 3 /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.1/share/man/man3/readline.3\n\nNote that the number after the -M specifies the \"man page section\", which is the last character in the file path. For example, I have two versions of sshd installed and I read can both their man pages with the following commands:\nman -M 8 /usr/share/man/man8/sshd.8\nman -M 8 /usr/local/Cellar/openssh/7.3p1/share/man/man8/sshd.8\n\nI'm curious why brew didn't symlink readline, since brew's readline is the only one installed - presumably past versions (I'm on Sierra) of macOS did have readline? I'd tend to be conservative here, and honour brew's decision as far as possible - just in case Apple decide to install readline again with a future OS upgrade. That being said, you could manually symlink readline:\nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.1/share/man/man3/readline.3 /usr/local/share/man/man3/readline.3\n\nThe risk with this is that - if Apple do install readline in the future - you'll end up with Apple's readline in your $PATH (and not brew's, since it's keg-only and hasn't been linked), but brew's readline will occur first in your $MANPATH, before the man page for Apple's readline.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2016 unable to restart due to Google Chrome I just received a 2016 Macbook Pro 15 touch running Sierra and after installing a bunch of apps and restarting I received the error message \nYour Mac hasn't restarted because \"Google Chrome\" failed to quit. To continue restarting, quit \"Google Chrome\".\nChrome then becomes unresponsive and all you can do is force quit. So I decided to do a clean install of Sierra and immediately install Chrome after setup completed to ensure it was Chrome and not some other app. However I get the exact same results. I can't see anything obvious related to this issue in the console either.\nIs this likely a hardware issue? I assume it must since I would expect there to be hundreds of google search results for this error if everyone had the same issue.\n\nA: If Google Chrome is the only program that gives you this problem it is most likely a software issue with Google Chrome. Ensure that you have the latest version installed - or even try installing Google Chrome Canary to see if it includes a fix.\n\nA: Chrome is notorious for not quitting.  Currently I have this happening with Messages.  Firefox does it too. I tend not to shut down for weeks at a time.\nExcel and Word, will pop up a dialog if you have any unsaved work, and they seem to think that opening a file makes it 'unsaved'\nPrevious answer regarding plugins is valid.  Try disabling all plugins. Restart Chrome, using Force quit if you have to.\nNow quit chrome.  Did it quit, or hang again.  If it does this with no plugins/extensions running, then try deleting Chrome, downloading a new copy an reinstalling.\nIf it quit properly, then enable half the extensions.  Quit Chrome, Start Chrome, quit. (You need the double quit:  The first one changes which extensions are running.  The second one tests if these extensions were ones with the problem.\nRepeat this divide and conquer with successive sets of plugins until you find the one that is the problem.\n", "Q: How to open \"BigTIFF\" files?

When I try to add a printer it asks for a username and a password of some user in the printer administration. How do I solve this?\n\nA: If it's your macbook, usually YOU are the administrator.  Try using your own username and password.\nI don't remember my username and password\nClick the Apple (grey, upper left) \n =>System Preferences\n => Users and Groups\nYour name should be highlighted.  You can change your password here.\nIt will also say if your account is standard or has admin rights.\n\nA: In macOS the user account has to be member of the admin group to make system-wide changes, adding printers is one such change. However, if you want to give a specific standard (non-admin) user the ability to add printers without supplying administrator credentials, you can include the user account in the _lpadmin group. Type following in Terminal, replacing someuser with account name you want to change:\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -a someuser _lpadmin\n\nIf you want to extend that right to all standard users on the system who are all members of the group staff, you can include group staff to the _lpadmin group. Type following in Terminal:\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -t group -a staff _lpadmin\n\nSince the Terminal command is prefixed with sudo that means that you will have to enter administrator credentials to make changes to the user database, but any subsequent printer administration by the standard users will not need administration credentials.\nIf you are in a controlled enterprise environment and do not have administration rights on your computer then ask your IT department to make the change to include your standard account in the _lpadmin group on the Mac.\n", "Q: What does `System Preferences.app` sync to iCloud?

I’ve just performed a fresh install on my machine (El Capitan to Sierra) and none of my settings carried over. So what is this doing?\n\nA: It is syncing your system preferences. The reason you did not see anything happen is that your former system was running El Capitan. The new sync feature only works with Sierra.\nSo if you had a Sierra Mac and then bought a new Sierra Mac and signed in on iCloud, you could sync over your system preferences from the old Mac.\n\nA: I searched alot about that and enden up talking with apple's support.

I'd like to do it through a single USB-C port using this a USB-C to 3 USB 3.0 hub like this one. Question!\nWhen I connect a single 3.0 device through the hub the maximum theoretical speed is 5Gb/s, right?\nIf I connect two 3.0 devices and read from them at the same time. Will each of them still transfer data with the speed of up to 5Gb/s or is it going to slow down? In other words, when the device says it provides 4 3.0 ports, does it use 3.0 protocol to talk to the laptop, and thus has to 'share' the 5Gb/s bandwidth among all the devices? OR does it take advantage of the usb-c port. In the case of the latter, does it then have 10 Gb/s to distribute (usb 3.1 protocol) or 40(thunderbolt 3).\n\nA: You won't get faster than USB 3.0 speed on the link to the Mac or any of the hub links. (You'd need a thunderbolt 3 hub for that.)\n\n\n*\n\n*USB 3.0 theoretical speed is 5 Gbit/s\n\n*USB 3.1 theoretical speed is 10 Gbit/s\n\n\nTheoretically - when you have a hub, there is overhead and losses and those depend on the quality of the chipset in the hub.\nIn practice - what is going to be providing or consuming data at even 3 Gb/s - not much. Get the hub you like for the support and price and warranty and when you have an actual performance issue - you can profile it and get a second hub or offload the one device to another port.\n", "Q: Slow WiFi speed on MacBook Pro late 2008 (A1286) I'm using a cheap TP-Link WiFi router and i'm hitting a wall at around 30 Mbps.\nI've tested with other laptops and they run fine to 100 Mbps.\nI have Yosemite at the moment, and an interesting fact is that, in the past, i don't remember on what OS, i was able to hit 100 Mbps on WiFi.\nAny suggestions regarding WiFi settings or chip firmware ?\n\n\nA: Be sure you are running the latest version of Mac OS X ( get 10.7.2+)\nApply all available system and software updates available to your Mac from Apple menu > Software Update\nReset the WiFi Router\nAfter you’re positive you’re on the newest version of OS X and have all software updates applied to the Mac in question, proceed with the solution:\nAdd a New Network Location & Renew DHCP Lease\nLaunch “System Preferences” from the  Apple menu\nSelect the “Network” panel\nClick on the “Location” pull down menu and choose “Edit Locations…”\nClick on the + plus icon to add a new network location, give it a unique name, and click “Done”\nBack at the Network panel with the newly created location selected, click on “Advanced” in the bottom right corner\nClick on the “TCP/IP” tab\nClick on “Renew DHCP Lease” and wait for the numbers on the left to repopulate, then click “OK”\nRenew DHCP in Mac OS X Lion\nYou should now have a stable wireless connection under Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2.\nFor most users the wifi stability issue was resolved with installing the latest OS X Lion updates, but in some cases is seems that old network connection profiles brought the problem forward for to the newest OS update.\n", "Q: Turning off iCloud sync w/ Photos on Mac threatens to delete local files A while back I elected to start syncing my Photos on my Mac to iCloud.  I quickly ran out of cloud storage (5GB).  I have decided I don't want to deal with some of the back & forth confusion between my computer & iCloud.\nIn Photos > Settings, under the iCloud tab, when I attempt to un-check iCloud Photo Library, a message comes up saying \"Your iCloud Photo Library is currently updating.\"  (This makes no sense - the library has long been full).  This message has two options, \"Turn Off\" and \"Continue Updating\".  Checking \"Turn Off,\" brings up a rather disconcerting message: 1,250 low-resolution items will be removed from this Mac. Full-resolution versions will remain in iCloud.  So my question is, why would turning off iCloud be cause to remove items from my computer?\nHelp is much appreciated,\nMax\nedit:  running OSX Yosemite 10.10.5\n\nA: You enabled a feature called \"Optimize Mac Storage\" where low-res photos will be stored locally on your Mac, but the original resolution photos will be stored in iCloud. So when you are disabling sync, iCloud choses to delete the low-res photos on your Mac, and keep them in iCloud.\nMethod 1: Contact Apple support, or walk into an Apple store and ask them for help.\nMethod 2: Try finding and disabling the feature I mentioned in the first paragraph. The alternative is called \"Download and Keep Originals. This will only work if you have enough space on your device. After you disable that feature, disable iCloud Photo Library\nMethod 3: You should try downloading all the photos currently stored in iCloud and put them in the same (create a new folder) folder as the ones that have not been uploaded (make sure they are original resolution, as a back up). Make sure there are no duplicates. The number of photos should add up to the total number of photos you had(2,073 in your case). Then just disable iCloud Photo Library. Then just delete all the photos in your Photo Library, and put all the pictures that in the backup you created earlier into your photo library.\n", "Q: Operation failed when I tried to create a partition I'm trying to create a partition in following \"Part 2: Preparing your Mac\" from this website.

The partition you are trying to create is only 128 mb. Even though it says create a 128MB partition(in the guide), it wouldn't cause any problems to increase the size of the partition since there are errors for creating a partition of the size 128MB.\n", "Q: Is there a way to see a calendar in Photos? I want to click on Dec 25th 2014 and see all the photos I took that day. I thought there used to be a calendar in iPhotos, was that removed in Photos on macOS? \n\nA: It doesn't look like the calendar made it into Sierra.  However, there are other ways to search for photos using specific keywords.  From this Apple Support page, you can either use Siri or Search to find photos taken on a specific day, at a specific location, or with specific people:\n\nFor information about how to search using keywords assigned to photos,\n  see Find photos by\n  keyword.\nAsk Siri. Say something like:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*“Show me photos of California”\n  \n*“Show me photos from April”\n  \n*“Show me beach photos”\n  \n*“Show me vacation photos”\n  \n*“Show me photos of Becky”\nUse the built-in Search Box in Photos:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click the search field in the toolbar.\n  \n*Type the search text in the search field.\nAs you type, suggested searches appear below the search field. You can\n  type multiple words separated by a space to search based on multiple\n  criteria. For example, entering “California March” locates all photos\n  in “California” taken in “March.\n  \n\n  \n*Click an item in the suggested searches to see matching photos.\n  \n\n", "Q: Using custom hardware keyboard layout on iOS I have an iPad Pro with the Apple Smart Keyboard, which works well. I usually use it with the Colemak hardware keyboard layout, which comes built in to iOS.\nI know that it is possible to install apps which give you custom virtual keyboards. Is it possible to do a similar thing but for hardware keyboard layouts?\nIn my case, I have a custom layout that I use on my computer to type the special characters in the International Phonetic Alphabet, and it would be nice to be able to use it on my iPad too.\n(Please note that I am not asking how to install third-party virtual keyboards; I specifially want to install a hardware keyboard layout.)\n\nA: Creating a hardware keyboard layout for iOS require you to assemble a .uchr file for the layout. This format is documented in the Unicode Utilities reference for the Carbon API. Such files could at one time be created with the klcompiler tool in the Font Tool Suite (!), except that it created big-endian output (probably from the PowerPC time) and iOS required little-endian output (more typical of the ARM processor), and this tool has since been retired from the Apple Download Centre, since it was 32-bits only (and there are only 64-bit versions of macOS remaining).\nTo install such a layout, it should be put in the /System/Library/KeyboardLayouts directory, which is not writable by the mobile user, but only by root. In addition, it is undocumented how new layouts are registered with the system - iOS does not scan this directory for new files as macOS does. A hack around this was to overwrite one of the existing layouts, e.g. USBKeyboardLayouts.bundle/uchrs/Colemak.uchr, and then select this one to activate it, but this would of course violate the checksum integrity of that layout.\n\nA: No, it is unfortunately not possible at this time without a jailbreak. Apple simply doesn't allow 3rd party apps to do this yet.\n", "Q: How do I make my iMac Apache server always run? I have a password protected Apache server running on my iMac (OS X Sierra 10.12.1) at home for personal purposes. It is accessible by the internet so that I can access my home files when I am outside my home.\nI have configured settings on my iMac so that I can lock the screen without making it go into sleep mode. However the web server still doesn't always run. When I try to access it from outside home, it only works about half of the time. I know that my home network being down etc. is not the issue, because connecting to my VPN server running on my Mac mini on the same network always works.\nI understand that making an iMac web server always accessible might be problematic, but if anyone know how to solve this or improve the uptime just a little bit I would be very grateful.\n\nA: \nso that I can access my home files when I am outside my home\n\nIf this is all you really want to do then you are using the wrong tool. \nGo to System Preferences -> Sharing and enable File Sharing.\nThen go to Options (same panel) and check the AFP box.\nThen forward port 548 on your router.\nYou can now access your files from the Finder ( Go -> connect to server) with read-write access instead of download only.\n", "Q: Assign shortcut for \"Look Up\" in context menu I'm looking for a way to assign a shortcut for the right click button Look Up.

Below is the pop-up that shows up when you look something up.\nI'm aware of the \"Look Up in Dictionary\" service and ability to assign a shortcut for that but it's not the same.\n\n\nA: You could try adding the keyboard shortcut for \"Look Up in Dictionary\" \n\nOnce you have that set, you can add a dictation command (assuming you have advanced dictation enabled) by just selecting any text and speak the phrase \"make this speakable\" which will open this dialog box..\n\nUse what ever phrase you want, then select keyboard shortcut in the drop-down menu and enter in the same shortcut you set in your system preferences.

You can easily overwrite your system if you use the incorrect target. If you do not already know how to use sudo on the command line, you should look for other image copying tools, with inbuilt safeguards.\n", "Q: Using 2 displays on late 2011 Macbook Pro I am running a late 2011 MacBook Pro (Processor  2.4 GHz Intel Core i5).\nI have 2 external monitors that I would like to use with my music production software (ableton live).\nI know that I can connect one monitor via thunderbolt to VGA or DVI and a second via USB. However I am conserving my USB slots and already like to run a multi HUB from one of my two USB slots, with my external sound card running from the second slot. My question therefore is:\nWould the power draw/data be too much to power a monitor as well as say, a MIDI keyboard and a mouse from an active USB hub. (All three devices are plugged into the hub and therefore into the same USB port on the laptop itself). \n\nA: Officially your MacBook Pro is only capable of simultaneously outputting a video feed to the internal display and a single external monitor. \nHowever, there are a number of USB display adapters that will allow you to support a second external display.\nUSB Display Adapters \nThese are USB to VGA or USB to DVI adapters. Some of these support up to a maximum resolution of 1920x1200 or 2048x1152.\nThese three are guaranteed to work on Apple Macs and support a maximum resolution up to 2048x1152:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kensington Multi Display Adapter USB 3.0\n\n*IOGear USB 3.0 to DVI External Video Card\n\n*OWC USB to DVI/HDMI/VGA Adapter\nThese adapters work in by compressing and decompressing the video signal in order to utilise the limited bandwidth provided by USB 2.0 or USB 3.0. \nHowever, you should be aware that there are limitations to USB Display Adapters. Namely they do not support OpenGL 3D hardware acceleration and you are likely to notice a lag.\nIf you're intention was to use these for gaming or animation/video editing, I'd say forget about it.  But with your music production software it may be fine as the emphasis will be on the audio side of things, especially if you keep your graphics intensive work limited to the other display connected via the Thunderbolt port.\nAs far as how well a hub will go trying to connect to another display as well as your MIDI keyboard and a mouse, your success will depend on the quality of the hub and ensuring that it's also got its own power source.\nA better option may be to also get a hub that connects to your Thunderbolt port that connects the display and also provides an additional USB port for example.\n", "Q: How can I flip the dash and underscore keys in macOS Sierra? I'd like to remap dash to underscore and vice-versa in macOS Sierra. I type underscore way more frequently than dash, so this is a desirable lifehack. Karabiner doesn't work anymore in Sierra (and the Elements version is a non-starter at this stage), and I can't seem to figure out how to do it in BetterTouchTool or Keyboard Maestro.

The one called \"Time Machine\" is set as the destination, and other drive, called \"External HD\", is in the exclusion list, and is not a target.\nYet TM continues to make Backups.backupdb folder appear on the other drive. This dir is very hard to delete. If you Trash it and try to empty the trash, it says it's in use, and every other error message you can think of, including that some files are protected by System Integrity Protection. The last time I had to turn off protection via csrutil and reboot just to finally empty the trash.\nAdditionally, \"External HD\" still shows the TM drive icon as well, just like the real TM drive. I know there're online workarounds for how to fix the icon, but my problem obviously goes beyond that.\nFor background, I'm on Sierra, 10.12.1. Also, as far as how this happened, I used to have a crappy USB hub, and drives would give out. When the TM drive wasn't available, TM would just take it upon itself to use the other external HD that was available at the time. So there're probably some system files that make it seem like a TM drive, although I'm not seeing anything obvious with ls -la.\nFinally, reformatting is not an option for me, as I don't have enough space on the primary drive to move everything over from \"External HD\" just to wipe it.\nTo sum up, I think I need to 1) Remove any trace of TM from a drive and 2) fix its icon. Thanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: The tmutil command should do the trick... in theory.\ntmutil destinationinfo\n\nshould list the External HD and an associated ID string; feeding that string to \ntmutil removedestination (destinationinfo_ID_string)\n\nshould stop Time Machine from backing up there; and \ntmutil delete (path/to/the/wayward/\"External HD\"/backups)\n\nshould remove the backups from External HD--at least it did in 2012.\n", "Q: How does Playlist sharing work? I have many playlists synced from my Mac to my iPhone and recently I 'shared' one of these playlists with a friend via the share card on my iPhone (sent to his phone via iMessage).\nTo my surprise he was able to listen to all the songs on the playlist, even songs that I know aren't available on iTunes (so only available on my Mac). I'd like to know how this feature works.\nFYI both of us have Apple Music.\n\nA: I'm not sure how fully this will answer your question, but in the absence of something official from Apple it's probably the best guess there is.\nEssentially, when one subscribes to Apple Music and also activates the iCloud Music Library, iTunes effectively syncs what's in your library with what's on Apple's servers. Music you have which is not available on iTunes is actually uploaded so that the servers have a way of sharing that music across your devices.\nTypically users can share their playlists with other users and, assuming they're both subscribed to Apple Music, there is no issue with this as both subscriptions have access to the music already available on Apple's servers.\nNow, what's happened in your case according to your question is that even songs that I know aren't available on iTunes (so only available on my Mac) were accessible by your friend who was able to listen to them all. This isn't surprising if the songs in question are already available on Apple's servers separately, but you're implying that they're not usually available, and that's where things get a little murky. \nI have personally manually imported music into my iTunes library (on my Mac) which as far as I could tell were not available on Apple's servers. However, some of them do get synced and are then available on all my devices, while others never become available to any of my devices (outside my Mac). What I can't account for is what differentiates these songs? \nFor example, I may search for ten songs on Apple's servers which do not come up on any search results. I then manually add them to my iTunes library and the whole syncing process (by virtue of the iCloud Music Library) takes place. Why it is some of them become available to my other devices, and some are not, I cannot say. However, the ones which are not available are still listed in the playlists on all my devices, even though they cannot be played (outside of my Mac). Trying to play them on other devices results in a \"Item Not Available: This item can't be played\" message.\nIf I check on iTunes (on my Mac) these songs have the symbol that represents either Waiting or Not Uploaded (they have the same icon - see here). So while they can be played on my Mac, they're not available on my other devices because they weren't able to be matched or uploaded (and therefore they cannot be shared with others as well). Sometimes these resolve over time, sometimes they just seem to stay that way.\nWhile it would be easy to assume this is some sort of bug, I think it's more likely that if a song which is not usually available on Apple's servers is nevertheless matched, the servers are then able to discern if the track can be played or not (because of some other licensing agreements, etc). However, if the song cannot be matched (which could just mean they weren't uploaded), then they can't be shared.\nIn a nutshell, the very act of having Apple Music and also iCloud Music Library activated means that all your songs, even the ones not normally available on Apple's servers, are synced to iCloud (even if it means having to actually upload them). This then makes them available (rightly or not) to other subscribers with whom you may share your playlists.\n", "Q: Rsync re-copying all files I use ParagonNTFS on my Mac that I can write to ntfs drives.\nI have two very large NTFS drives that I try to keep in sync. I'd like to be able to do this quickly with rsync:\nrsync -rvh --delete /Volumes/Archive/ /Volumes/MobArchive/\n\nUnfortunately, this command re-copies every file every time, including those that have not been updated. As a result, it takes all night to complete.\nAs a result, I have to use the --size-only option, which generally works as desired, except for files that have been updated but whose size has not changed.\nI have read elsewhere that a common solution to this problem is to use --modify-window=1. In my case, however, this still causes all files to get copied. I have tried modify-window values all the way up to ten.\nAny possible solutions?\n\nA: If you change your command to start rsync -rvh ... to rsync -avh ... you should have more success.\nThe way you have the command just now rsync isn't copying over date stamps. The files in MobArchive will have their Create, Modify and Access times set to the time they are created in MobArchive. So every time rsync does a compare the date stamps in Archive and MobArchive will not match and it'll copy over everything again.\nThe \"a\" option (aka \"archive\" mode) is the equivalent of \"-rlptgoD\" which does a number of things including preserving timestamps.\n", "Q: Transferring from a Samsung Galaxy to a Mac Is it ok to connect a Samsung Galaxy to a Mac for transferring photos?\nI'm not sure if it is ok to do this with two different brands.\n\nA: A good wireless method that I use between Android and Mac is Soduto with KdeConnect.\nBoth are open source apps.\nYou can find Soduto for Mac here https://soduto.com/\nYou can find KDEConnect for Android here https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp&hl=en_IN&gl=US\nNow install these and make sure they are on the same Wifi network. Then Pair the two devices (using Soduto on mac to pair with Android through KDEConnect).\nPairing is necessary only once, and you can transfer files and even your Clipboard history across the two devices anytime you want without the hassle of connecting wires!!\n\nA: Zero problem. Just use the USB cable and transfer the files, or go by bluetooth if you have the time. Both work flawless. Airdrop also works if you want to use an app and transfer over wlan. If you use the USB cable, you will get a lot of mac files on your Galaxy's SD card file system, like a file called \".DS_Store\" in each folder. This doesn't hurt, but you might want to remove them or wonder where they came from.\n\nA: Yes it is fine. You can use whatever software you want to do the transfer.\n\nA: I also have a galaxy and a mac, and it doesn't work for me. I'd recommend this mimic of airdrop, called Airdroid. Very straightforward. You go to  http://web.airdroid.com/ then install the app on your galaxy, scan a QR code displayed on the website then transfer whatever.

The series of problems include:\n\n\n*\n\n*My 3rd-party Chinese input methods (Sogou & Rime) both start double-typing on every letter. English isn't affected, but cycling through the keyboards do not help with the problem.\n\n*Launchpad starts taking double keystroke and double touchpad swipes on arrow keys, basically skipping any odd-numbered pages\n\n*Any keystrokes plus the return key would launch an app whose name starts with those keystrokes (which is a Spotlight behavior) regardless of whether Spotlight is on.

I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013.) This model has an built-in Intel Iris Pro GPU and a dedicated GeForce GPU. \nWithout an external display, the integrated GPU is active and the dedicated GPU is idle.\nAfter I connect an external display, the built-in GPU is idle and the dedicated GPU is active. Power consumption nearly doubles, the system get hotter and the fans turn on.\nI expected the dedicated GeForce GPU to only take over when the intensive graphic programs are running, not when running Safari on two displays. \nDoes the integrated GPU support two displays?\nIf yes, then how can I get the integrated GPU to support two displays?\n\n\n\n\nA: The external graphics port(s) are literally wired to the discrete graphics chip.  The only card that has access to the TB port is the AMD dedicated card. That's the same reason why you need the AMD card enabled to do anything with the TB port. \n This is why connecting an external monitor will always (regardless of method of deactivating the discrete graphics) enable the discrete graphics.  \n\nA: By default your MacBook Pro will automatically switch between the two graphics processors depending on how you're using your computer at the time.\nBy way of example, your MacBook Pro uses the integrated Intel Iris Pro GPU if you're typing a document or browsing the web, but will switch to the dedicated NVIDIA GeForce GPU when you connect an external display or play a graphics-intensive game - basically whenever the extra graphics performance is needed.\nWhile this default behaviour is convenient and the best option for most users most of the time, as you have discovered there are times when it'd be better to bypass this.\nYou have three options that give you some manual control over how the two graphics processors work:\n1. You can deselect Automatic Graphics Switching in System Preferences > Energy Saver. However, this actually enables the dedicated NVIDIA GeForce GPU by disabling the auto switching and does the exact opposite of what you want.\n2. Use the gfxCardStatus menu bar application to switch between your two graphics cards manually. This also lists which applications use the dedicated graphics so you have more control.\nPlease note that while the gfxCardStatus application has been a saviour for many countless users over the years, that for some models the latest version is not actually the best one to use. I would install the latest version first (v2.3), but if you run into problems then try version 1.8.1 followed by version 2.1.\n3. Use gpu-switch to effectively do the same thing as the gfxCardStatus application, but switch between the integrated and dedicated GPU for the next reboot without the need of booting into macOS and running gfxCardStatus. However, setting this up is more for advanced users.\nThe best way for you to find out if the integrated Intel Iris Pro GPU is capable of supporting your particular monitor is to try Option 2 above (i.e. use gfxCardStatus) to manually select it and see how you go.\n", "Q: Manage OS X partition from Windows I have dual boot Mac with OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 and Windows 10 installed.

To backup and restore the OS X partition I am planning to use Windows 10.\n\nA: Your Mac should have a recovery partition. If, for some reason, your Mac partition becomes unbootable, you can boot into recovery mode (hold down Cmd-R when you hear the startup chime) and follow the on-screen instructions to restore from your latest backup.\nIf, for some reason, your recovery partition is corrupted or missing altogether, you will end up in Internet Recovery mode instead, which will install a fresh copy of OS X from the internet first.\n\nA: You should be able to view your Mac OS files from Windows, when it's installed via Bootcamp.

In particular, the diagram showing \"The CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram showing the primaries of the Adobe RGB (1998) color space\" - the three points of the triangle (the \"primaries\") correspond to these points (moving anti-clockwise, from the right):\n\n\n*\n\n*R = 255, G = 0, B = 0\n\n*R = 0, G = 255, B = 0\n\n*R = 0, G = 0, B = 255\n\n\nThe same system of 256 steps is used for other colour spaces like sRGB, even though they may well be a different size to Adobe RGB's colour space.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect a MacBook Pro 2011 to the LG UltraFine 5K display using a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter? I'm currently using the MacBook Pro (13'', early 2011) which contains a Thunderbolt port. Unfortunately, the LG UltraFine 5K display uses a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) port.\nThat's why I'm currently thinking about connecting them via a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter.\nI'm aware that there were quite a few questions concerning this topic on the Apple homepage. But the answers there weren't really confidable and accurate.\n\nA: No, your 2011 MacBook Pro supports a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1600 on an external display.

Sometimes this happens immediately, sometimes after about 10-20 seconds. \nIt does not happen when I pause the video, as long as it is on pause I can navigate freely between all desktops. As soon as I press play again, it starts jumping back to the video no matter what I do. \nI would like to play a video on full screen while not actually looking at it the entire time.

I own a MacBook Pro 13\" (early 2015). It has a dual-core i5 2,9GHz processor, 8go DDR3 RAM and 512Gb hard disk.\nThe computer performs well in general. I use it exclusively for web development. My memory usage is quite good, I have a memory pressure around 55% in general.\nHowever, several times in a day my CPU hang up during heavy tasks:\n\n\n*\n\n*debugging,\n\n*indexing in the IDE,\n\n*database backup,\n\n*and several other docker manipulations.\n\n\nI was wondering if there is some way to increase my CPU power while working at office. \nI read about connecting the MBP to an iMac and booting it in \"target disk mode\". It appears I can run my system using the hardware of the iMac.\nHowever, it looks like this is rarely used, and I didn't find some good user reports on using it.\nSo, some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does it perform really well and really better ?\n\n*Can I have a lost of performance because of the use of the thunderbolt port ?\n\n*Is it safe ?\n\n*Does sofwtare complains about switching from one system to another ?\n\n*Are there any other alternatives ?\n\n*Does the performance gain can be better than simply upgrading to an early MBP 15 inch ?\n\n\nA: To answer your questions quickly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes\n\n*No\n\n*Very likely\n\n*Probably\n\n*Not really\n\n*Maybe\n\n\nExplanation:\nNote that this is assuming you are booting the laptops SSD drive from the iMac. Basically this operation allows you to use the internal SSD as an external hard drive. If you boot into this drive from another computer, you are now using the resources that the computer you are working on offers. (If you go to about this Mac, you'll see the specs of the iMac you are now using.) This is definitely possible to do, and because thunderbolt speeds are at least 10Gbps (faster than the read/write speeds of the PCIe SSD), the thunderbolt cable will not be a bottleneck. It is very likely safe to do, although you should ALWAYS have a current backup in case something goes sideways. Most software should be ok with the switch, as the SSD's ID is still the same, but it is something you should test out by trying. Again, have a backup in case something goes wrong. Your only other option would be to get a new computer. The performance gain by getting the higher end 15\" MBP might work, but iMacs will likely have more power than any laptop because there is more cooling space and less power worries, so Apple can put faster processors in.\nTL;DR: if you have an iMac available, that is a great idea! If you'd have to buy an iMac to make this happen, you might want to explore other options.\nPlease let me know if something was unclear or you have any questions/comments/clarifications about my answer.\n\nA: Target Disk Mode just lets you access the storage in one Mac from another. It doesn't allow you access to any of the other hardware resources.\nThe storage devices of the Mac booted into Target Disk Mode will appear as external storage devices on the other Mac.

As it is essential for the operation of the watch. What I did was just make a folder named 'Apple' and dump all Apple apps that I don't use often but somewhat essential for some things into that folder, like Weather, etc. \n", "Q: How to install apps on iOS 7.1 I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 71.

On the app store if you look carefully it will give you system requirements.  Lots of apps have a minimum iOS level.\nSo if you want an app that needs iOS 8 you need to upgrade your phone.\nFor most of this we need to want an app really badly to fork out that kind of money.  Look for other apps with similar functionality.\nUnfortunately the iTunes app store doesn't give you a filter to weed out the ones that won't work.  Google is your friend here.

While trying to download Pokémon GO from the ios-appstore, this dialog box appeared:\n\nTranscribed:\n\nThis item is over 100MB.\nUnless an incremental download is available for this item, \"Pokémon GO\" may not download until you connect to Wi-Fi.\nCancel OK\n\nWhat is an incremental download?\n\nA: This could refer to one of two things, installing an app in the first place or updating an app that is already installed.\nThere are also a number of techniques that developers can use to reduce the size of their apps. One that was introduced in iOS 9 is App Thinning. This is where a developer tells the App Store which parts of their app are necessary all the time and which parts are optional. For example with a game, a developer might just choose to provide a small number of levels initially, with subsequent levels to be downloaded as and when the player reaches them. This reduces the initial install size and storage size used on your device. You can read about App Thinning and other techniques that developers use to reduce the size of their apps here: Technical Q&A QA1795 - Reducing the size of my App.\nAs of iOS 6 when you install an app update on your device it might just  download the files that have actually changed within the app. The idea being that these \"update packages\" should be a smaller than downloading another complete copy of the app. For example with a game, if the update is just to fix a crashing bug it might just need to update a single executable file rather than downloading all the interface files, images, level information, etc that make up an app. You can read more about this here: Technical Q&A QA1779 - Reducing Download Size for iOS App Updates\n", "Q: Symlinking /User/SpecialFolder to different drive creates Folder in Folder Just finished re-installing macOS Sierra on my MBP and am trying to move the ~/Downloads and other folders to a different drive so they end up in /Volumes/Data/ instead.\nI created a /Volumes/Data/Downloads folder and symlinked from one to the other like so:\nsudo ln -s /Volumes/Data/Downloads Downloads\n\nThis works more or less, but it creates another Downloads folder inside the /Volumes/Data/Downloads folder so the full path would be\n/Volumes/Data/Downloads/Downloads\n\nAny Idea what I'm doing wrong?\nSo it looks like this:\n\n\nA: This occurred because you already had something in your home directory called \"Downloads\" - the ln command is smart enough not to write over it, so instead created the symlink within it.\nIf you're starting from scratch you can mv ~/Downloads ~/Volumes/Data/; if you've already successfully copied your Downloads directory you can simply delete the old one in your home directory: rm -Rf ~/Downloads.\nAfter that your original ln command should work. You shouldn't need to prefix it with sudo:\nln -s /Volumes/Data/Downloads ~/Downloads\n\nOr, as fd0 suggested, instead of using rm you could use ln -s -f option to unlink the directory. Thus creating the desired results:\nln -s -f /Volumes/Data/Downloads ~/Downloads\n\n\nA: Try writing full path instead, I think what you wanted to write is:\nsudo ln -s /Volumes/Data/Downloads ~/Downloads\n\n", "Q: Is the case insensitive comparison broken for mdfind?

If so, how can I make it see that it has more? (TL;DR below)\nSo I've recently installed Windows on my mid-2014 Macbook Pro Retina 13\" to play some games. I never expected super incredible performance in 3D games, but nevertheless I have been severely disappointed with it and I wonder if there's something wrong with my hardware or drivers.\nGames such as The Witness (a puzzle game in 3D with stylized graphics and no action) and Spec Ops: The Line (a shooter that wasn't super graphically flashy even when it was released, in 2012), barely even ran, and had to be configured with the absolute minimum graphics settings for them to reach 20—30fps. Same thing with Rocket League, a super accessible sports-racing hybrid that any half-decent budget machine can run decently. The worst, though, was Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, a flat 2D game — it ran more smoothly on my friend's much, much older and weaker non-Apple laptop.\n\n\nI had to lower my resolution for this.\n\nKnowing next to nothing about hardware, I did a bit of research and found out that my machine has Intel Iris Graphics and, most interestingly, that macOS dynamically allocates up to 1.5GB of system memory to the graphics card. \nHowever, when I was on Windows, I went into Can You Run It? and used its system diagnosis tools to test my specs against the minimum requirements for some games (nothing fancy, I didn't check against the new 2016 Doom game or even GTA V). Every result said that I didn't meet even the minimum requirements for the games (even for games that I had actually ran already) because, according to it, I only have 112.5 MB of available video RAM on Windows.\nSo I'm thinking that that is actually the problem. \n\nIs this really all the memory I can have?\nTL;DR: Actual question(s)\nCan Windows allocate more than 112.5 MB of RAM to graphics?\nIs it capable of doing that dynamically the way macOS does? If not, is there a way to force this to a different amount of RAM, since it's apparently using the minimum possible amount? (My machine has 8GB, it would be no problem dedicating 2GB of those to graphics, maybe even more since all I do on Windows is open Steam.) \nI'm using Windows 10 with the Bootcamp-provided drivers. Didn't manually update a thing, for fear of breaking compatibility. \nEven if I'm completely off-track here and my entire line of reasoning is faulty, is there anything else I can do to eek more graphical performance from my machine under Bootcamped Windows?\nThanks so much for your time.\n\nA: Windows can allocate as much video memory as the driver allows. So the problem is not really with Windows, but the driver that Apple provides for that system. Yes Apple wrote the Windows driver for bootcamp on your Mac.\nI don't have specific experiences with this but I have heard of people going directly to the manufacturers web site and downloading the drivers for the specific version of Windows and the graphics card in your Mac. Often this will work for other system hardware as well.\nThe worst that should happen is that you'll have to boot into safe mode to remove the driver, assuming you can find it on Intel's web site and get it to install.\n\nA: First of all, for the benefit of everyone reading this, VRAM (Video RAM) is a physical part of the hardware. It is basically the RAM used by the graphics card. Dedicated graphics cards have their own special VRAM (often referred to as GGDR5), however any type of RAM can be used, including the RAM in your computer.\nYour MacBook Pro only has an Intel Iris 5100 graphics processor that shares memory with the system. In your case, the amount can be as high as 1.5GB.\nWindows 10 will manage the amount of VRAM available, however how well it does that will depend on the drivers installed. \nDid you update your graphics drivers on your Windows partition?\nAre you using the correct drivers for the Intel Iris 5100 graphics processor on Windows 10?\nAlso, I have seen instances where resetting the SMC actually helps in terms of VRAM and Bootcamp partitions (although this is a surprise to me, I've seen it with my own eyes). To do this on your particular MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\n[EDIT 1] \nFor the latest Windows drivers for the Intel Iris Graphics 5100 visit this page.\n[EDIT 2]\nJust wanted to try and address some of the questions/concerns based on the OP's comments.\n1. VRAM  - The amount of memory available for the Intel Iris Graphics 5100 is dependent on non-Intel-controlled factors such as the available system memory, BIOS/EFI , system settings, etc. These factors are used by Windows 10 to determine how much of your system memory will be allocated. However, the absolute maximum that can be allocated to this particular graphics card is 2048MB. Anything telling you that it's being allocated more is wrong.\n2. Drivers - Windows 10 drivers on your Mac are essential to ensure your Mac runs properly on Windows 10. However, if the Mac drivers are outdated, missing, corrupted, damaged, or incompatible after a Windows 10 installation (or update), your Mac  and other devices connected to it will not work properly on Windows 10. When it comes to Windows Bootcamp installations, I always take the approach that “if it ain’t broken, don't fix it”. In your case though, it's worth checking for driver issues. The best way to do this is by downloading and updating to the latest Mac drivers.  The two options I've seen used most often to achieve this are:\nOption 1 - Use the Apple Software Update for Windows to install any available driver updates for Windows 10. However, it doesn't always work well and I've read that some drivers are not available via this method. Also, you may need to be patient for it to update any necessary drivers as it can take hours. Because of these reasons, the next approach is often used.\nOption 2 - Use one of the many utilities that enable you to update drivers for Windows installations. Driver Talent is one of these utilities and it can help repair any Mac drivers that are corrupted or damaged. It will also download and install any Windows 10 Mac drivers that are missing or outdated. Note there are both free and pro versions available.\nNOTE: I have no affiliation whatsoever with the Driver Talent software. I mention it only because I have seen it resolve issues with Windows Bootcamp installations.\n3.

After trying to connect power, disconnect power and seeing charge for 10 minutes and then off charge for 10 minutes, you should have a good understanding of what is or what isn't working.\nAt that point, try resetting your SMC one time. Make a note of the information as if that doesn't fix things it's likely a hardware service situation. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295 - How to reset the SMC\n\n\nA: Believe it or not, this was actually an intentional change as of macOS 10.12.2.  Likely in response to the complaints about short/erratic battery life in the newer Touch Bar-equipped models of MacBook Pro, Apple simply removed that information from the menu.  It is, however, still accessible from the Energy tab of Activity Monitor.\nFrom this page:\n\nApple tells us that according to all its testing and user data, the batteries in the new MacBook Pros are performing normally—there’s no bug that’s sapping your battery, and your real-world battery life is still going to be influenced strongly by your workload. The only battery life-related fix in 10.12.2 is the removal of the “time remaining” estimate from the operating system. Apple says this is because modern components switch power states so frequently and quickly that it’s hard to correctly estimate remaining battery life based on current activity.\n\n\nA: I made a really simple little app that displays the remaining time in the mac menubar.\nhttps://github.com/funkyremi/macos-battery-remaining-menubar\n\nA: The battery time remaining was intentionally removed by Apple due to the inaccuracy of the estimation, which is highly dependent on the laptop workload. Nonetheless, there are some free mac os apps, such as TLOB, that bring this feature back.\n", "Q: Time Machine not \"remembering\" external hard drive backup after not being connected for some time I use Time Machine on my MacBook Pro (late 2011, macOS Sierra) to back up my internal hard drive and an external hard drive containing heavy files such as video, etc. This worked great for about a month: each backup would contain separate folders for my internal drive and external drive, even if my external drive was not plugged in (as it most often is not, since that drive is mostly used for long-term storage).\nHowever, today, when I added a file to my external hard drive and plugged in my backup drive, it began backing up the ENTIRE contents of the external drive again... which, I hadn't noticed until now, was because the backup files stopped including my external hard drive and would only show my internal hard drive. So, I'm very confused, and I'd rather not have to waste some 400 or so GB of space on my backup drive with this copying of data... Anyone know what might be going on here? It seems to me like Time Machine somehow \"forgot\" I had a second drive to back up... And yes, I checked the \"Exclude\" list in Time Machine preferences (Can Time Machine back up an external hard drive in addition to internal one?).\n\nA: Once a backup interval happens where the external is skipped, you might end up with two copies. Getting partial recognition of unchanged files to have them deduplicated would require a lot of scripting to recreate hard links across several folders. \nI usually set that drive on a shelf and buy a new one. Once the new one has sufficient backup history, you could check for deleted files or just wipe the \"broken\" drive. The risk of not realizing a file was corrupt or deleted is slim but exactly what a backup is designed to do. \nIn the end, you'll need to evaluate the cost of a new drive and the cost of potentially losing a file you could have recovered and minimize your risk and budget costs. \n", "Q: Photos taking up storage on iPhone when I have no photos Problem from iOS 10.1.1 to 10.2.1.\nI have no photos at all on my iPhone yet in settings it says my photo library is taking up ~200MB of space. The number of space being taken up keeps changing constantly(in the settings app on my phone). In iTunes, the storage bar at the bottom does(when in the sync menu) not show photos.\n\n\n\n \nWhat is taking up this storage, and how can I reduce it?\nTroubleshooting:\n\n\n*\n\n*I disabled iCloud photo library and iCloud photo stream, still showing the same thing.\n\n*Tried doing what @User9125 said, didn't work. I had set the date all the way back when I first got my phone, nothing showed up.\n\n*Rebooting\n\n*I had hundreds of photos in Whatsapp, I deleted them but I didn't get the storage back. It didn't even make a dent in the amount of storage being used by Photos so I don't think a third-party app could be taking up this storage.\n\n*I don't think a system app is taking this space either, because I cleared the pictures in mail and messages.\n\n*I tried using iCleaner(through sideloading) in Secure Mode and Fast Mode, but it did not clear up the photos.\n\nA: There might be phantom photos still in your Photos app. Just do these things and it will solve your problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Date & Time\n\n*Untoggle \"Set Automatically\"\n\n*Manually change the date back.

Those are your phantom photos\n\n*Open it, \"Select\" and start deleting\n\n*Now, go back into Settings - General - Usage - Storage - Manage Storage - and you'll notice your Photo & Camera is empty if you deleted everything.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and no date/time tricks or whatever I found on the Internet worked for me. I managed to finally find and remove the photos using iExplorer application. Here is the youtube video.\nThe app is not free but you can run it in demo mode and still find and remove the hidden photos.\n\nA: Reboot iPhone that (usually) clears the ghost data\n\nA: Try to restore your device through itunes\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library stores the photos you take in iCloud automatically and then stores lower-quality versions on your phone. I think you might have photos stored in this service, which could be causing storage usage of photos on your phone even if they aren't showing up locally on your phone. \nTry turning off iCloud Photo Library if you have it on, as I think this is what is causing the storage usage of photos on your device. Go to Settings -> iCloud -> Photos and try turning iCloud Photo Library off; I suspect this will free up the megabytes of storage.\n\nA: Last week I was annoyed by my iPhone 6 16GB which was low on available storage. I connected the iPhone to my macbook, started iTunes and synced the iPhone without changing any of the settings. After syncing, I had 1.5 GB available storage.\nI do not know how this could have helped, maybe it set some huge caches straight, but it could also be a solution for you.\n", "Q: Will iphone 5s convert text emoticons in SMS?

It looks like this:\n\nIt eally annoys!\nI have checked my login items and there are not such apps.\n\nHow I can disable them? I would like to open my laptop and see clean screen.\nEDIT \nScreenshot from bach\n\n\nA: EDIT: Having re-read the question, my original answer may not be necessary. By default, when you log in, OS X opens all the windows you had open when you logged out. If you don't want it to do this, then uncheck the option \"reopen windows when logging back in\" that appears when you log out:\n\nThis should give you an empty desktop when you log back in. If not, then it's back to my original answer (below).\n\nSome apps unfortunately don't respect that option, and create Launch Agents (processes that run at login) or sometimes Launch Daemons (which run at boot) to manage their lifecycle.\nSuch apps often do have a preference buried somewhere to change their login behaviour, so double-check that first, as that's always the safest solution.\nIf there isn't a preference, you can see what Launch Agents are running by going to your terminal and running:\nlaunchctl list\nIf you want to see which Adobe-related agents are running, pipe the output to grep with something like:\nlaunchctl list | grep -i adobe\nIf you see anything there, then it's likely that Adobe is using this mechanism. So what to do about it?\nHave a look in the following folders to find files with the same names that you saw in the output of the launchctl command... in your case, probably called com.adobe.<something>.\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/LaunchAgents \n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\n*/System/Library/LaunchAgents\n\n*/System/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\n\nOnce you've found them, try renaming rather than deleting them (e.g. by adding \".ignore\" to the end of their filenames). Then reboot to see if that's had the desired effect. If it has, you're good to go... but watch out for other side-effects in case the Launch Agent has more than one function, and be prepared to go through the process again whenever you receive a software update.\nIf it hasn't worked, restore their original filenames to avoid any undesired side-effects, and keep digging...\n\nA: have a look in /Library/LaunchDaemons too.\n", "Q: Define Archive Folder in different account Following the question, How to change the Mail “Archive” folder for email accounts in El Capitan:\nI have several mail accounts in macOS Sierra and would like to archive all mail in one folder in one specific account.

What is this supposed to do?\nLooks like I'm also unable to take TouchBar screenshots via ⌘+⇧+6 for some reason.\n\nA: Are you watching a video in Safari? That slider is telling you that you're watching a video in the app displayed in the icon, scrubbing on that slider scrub the video you're playing.

Is there a simple meditation timer app that actually logs time spent meditating to the Health app as mindful minutes? I need just a simple timer, no guided meditation (and certainly no subscription). Preferably an Apple Watch app?\n\nA: Sattva - Meditation Timer & Tracker\nSattva is the world’s first advanced meditation timer and tracker with challenges, trophies and guided meditations to inspire you to meditate everyday!\nHas the features you requested:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple health kit integration for mindfulness (minutes)\n\n*Apple Watch app\n\n\nA: After many months of trying different apps, the one that best addresses what I need is Timeless. Sattva does not log meditation time when you meditate on the watch. Timeless does, though you have to open the iPhone app after meditating to get it to log the time. \nI'll just editorialize a little and say that it's crazy that, in the Mindfulness section of the Health app, Apple promotes a bunch of apps that don't record mindful minutes.\n\nA: Meditation Timer and Log\nThis free app is for anyone who enjoys meditation. It's lightweight, simple to use and has bubbly feeling to lift you up. Practice meditation in the way you like it, and we will help you to personalize and keep track of your meditation activities.\nIn the latest update it added: \"Integration with Apple Health\". \n\nA: I can really recommend Samsara, https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/samsara-timer/id592333521?mt=8. It's a meditation timer without distractions, and yet it has enough options to customise. If you use it on your iPhone, it will automatically log your meditation as Mindfulness Minutes in Apple Health.\n\nA: The app I'm currently using is called Meditate (Watch). The developer emailed me and explained the situation: the only way an app can stay foremost and running on the watch is to open an Activity. That's how all the other apps work.\nMeditate is different: you start a meditation, and the app runs a timer. When the meditation is complete, you get a notification on the watch, which you tap to re-open the app and save the session.\nThe downside of this is that you can't glance at your watch and check your progress while you meditate. The upside is that it correctly stores mindful minutes without recording to the Activity app. FTW.\nThe app is very simple and elegantly designed, and I find that it works great for me. I use Streaks to motivate me to keep meditating, and these two apps communicate automatically through the Health app data.

Thanks much!\n\nA: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist would be the first one to try.\n\nA: Turns out it was ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist - restoring that did the trick.\n", "Q: Touch ID best practices Are there any \"best practices\" for setting up Touch ID fingers on an iPhone?\nI know how to setup this, but I believe I may miss some of the unlock scenarios during setup and end up unable to unlock my phone without taking it in hand or one of the \"ways\" I held it during setup.\n\nA: Apple does not provide any guidance as to which fingers you should set up. It is purely a matter of personal preference as to which fingers you use based on the ways you hold your device when unlocking.\nI suggest adding fingers you consistently use when trying to unlock your device to Touch ID, and removing any fingers you don't use often. In case you didn't label your Touch ID fingerprints, you can see which fingerprint corresponds to which row in Settings by holding your finger on Touch ID when in the Settings page.\n\nA: I added my two thumbs and my two index fingers. This allows me to unlock the phone with both hands. I find it easier to unlock it when it's resting on my desk with my index fingers. \nPlus, I can lose one hand and still unlock my iPhone!\nOn the second stage (\"Adjust your grip\") I change my finger position and how I hold the phone to allow for different holding / unlocking scenarios.\n\nA: The more fingers you add to Touch ID, the less selective it will be. For example, if you train the system with four fingers, then it will be four times as likely to match on a stranger's finger.\nFrom Apple's iOS Security Security Guide, p. 10 (edited):\n\nThe probability that a random person in the population could unlock\n  your iPhone is 1 in 50,000 with Touch ID.... This probability increases with multiple enrolled fingerprints (up to 1 in 10,000 with five fingerprints)....\n\nSo, you should train the fingers you need for the system to be convenient, but no more, and remember that you're balancing convenience against security.\n", "Q: Your connection is not private I am unable to access certain websites within Chrome. I am getting the error message \"Your connection is not private\". Anyone know how to fix this?\nI've already tried the following:\nCleared cache and cookies, resetting the browser, reinstalling the browser,\ndowngrading/upgrading the browser (happens on multiple versions of Chrome)\nand same websites work in Firefox and Safari.\nI've corrected the time and that did not fix the issue. I ran the command sudo ntpdate -u time.apple.com \n\n\nA: Click on the Advanced link on the bottom left.  It will show you an option to continue on to the site you want to visit. \nChrome will show you this page if it finds problems with certificates, http vs https, etc.  It's just to let you know that it thinks something's not right and it gives you the option to continue or go back.\n\nA: Are you on a VPN of any sort (like a work network)? \nThis error warns you of a Man in the Middle Attack (MITM). This means that there is potentially someone sitting between you and the website (main.yahoo.com) and trying to intercept the back and forth communication. Chrome thinks this because mail.yahoo.com uses https and https sites are supposed to provide a certificate. In this case Chrome thinks the certificate that it gets is not a good certificate (That's why CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID).  \nThis happens if there is a really someone spoofing the network or if you are on a VPM of some sort like a work network. Some work networks use a self signed certificates that Chrome generally does not like. Some anti virus, firewall or other kind of network software may also cause this.\nSee also the steps to resolve this error in google help here: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6098869?hl=en\n\nA: The most common cause of this issue is an incorrect date & time set on your PC. Chrome makes sure that your computer's clock matches the clock in a Google server farm, and if it doesn't, will block the connection to HTTPS sites for security reasons. \nTo fix your issue, set your computer's clock to the correct current time. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Choose Date & Time\n\n*Navigate to the Date & Time tab\n\n*Change the current time to the correct time (accurate to the nearest minute will do).\n\n\nEdit: If it's not your computer's fault, it's just a Chrome security feature. Chrome detects malicious activity going on with the site (like malware-laced ads, breach by hackers, etc.) and automatically warns you to protect you if it believes your security or safety might be at risk. If you want to override the warning, just hit Advanced -> Continue to site.\n\nA: The simplest method I often use to bypass this is to click on the Advanced link and then Process to the site.\nIn most cases, this connection error occurs because your computer has a wrong date & time. You need to check it as well.\nYou can also ignore the ssl from the Google Chrome shortcut by adding this code: \"--ignore-certificate-errors\", according this guide.\nIf the problem persists, I would recommend you to uninstall your Google Chrome, download a new & latest version and reinstall it. Before doing so, make sure you have backup it with ChromeSync or manually, in order to restore all data back when reinstalling the Chrome browser.\n", "Q: Enable VoiceOver ine only one app? My kid likes to listen to music on her iPad, but she can't read yet (she's working on it) so she has to play each song for a few seconds to find the song to which she wants to listen. Is there a way to enable VoiceOver for just the Music app? Enabling it for the entire device is annoying. Or is there an alternate way to play music that will speak the song titles?\n\nA: You can't enable VoiceOver for just one app, but you can easily turn VoiceOver on and off.\nMethod 1(Siri): Just launch Siri(by pressing and holding the home button), and say \"Turn on Voice Over\", and and Siri will reply(no reading necessary). You can also turn Voice Over off, by saying \"Turn of Voice Over\" when you leave the app.\n\nMethod 2(Acessibility Shortcut): Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut and tap \"VoiceOver\". Now whenever you triple-click the home button, it will enable voice over, and when you triple click it again, it will disable VoiceOver.\n\n\nA: My six year old son is always asking \"What song is this?\" when we play music, and I got tired of having to go read the titles for songs I didn't know (common when we're listening to soundtracks, etc.). So I ended up figuring a way to almost announce only the songs (currently on macOS 12/Monterey so this should work for anything above that).\n\n*\n\n*In VoiceOver utility, go under Verbosity and set it to 'Low', then click the 'Announcements' tab & un-check everything except 'Automatically speak text in dialog boxes'.

Then open the 'Use this activity for:' menu and select the apps you want to enable it for (in my case, Music and Sonos).\n\n\nCaveat: it does seem that the app selected needs to be the active app, or VoiceOver won't read the notification (i.e. the song title), so if you're in another app it won't narrate. But for my use case, I can start the music, leave the app open, and go do something else, and the computer will faithfully announce the song titles (I even have those going through the system speaker while the music plays through the Sonos speakers so we don't have to hear the computer voice in the rest of the house).\nNote: I noticed OP was for iOS devices, but it appears you can do the same, just note that the preferences screens will look a bit different.\n", "Q: Tiger DVD ripper I have an old PowerBook G4. Since my new Mac hasn't any built-in DVD reader, I would like to use the old one to copy the movies onto a USB stick to be able to watch them when I'm traveling with the new Mac (and then delete them, I don't want to do anything illegal! [In my country copying DVDs for personal use is legal.]).\nSometimes I can simply copy the DVD folder content, but that obviously doesn't work with encrypted DVDs. What is the best free DVD ripper for a Mac running OS X Tiger?\n\nA: Handbreak is a great software for ripping DVDs on a Mac. Since your device is older, you won't find a download on the official site, but there are archived versions here. You will should be able the right download for your computer. If you can't find it, try this download.\nYou can get an official Apple disc drive called the Apple USB Super Drive.(it is a bit pricy, $79 USD). You can also find some pretty cheap USB drives for your new Mac, then use Handbreak.

It's pretty easily to install, just Google it.\n", "Q: How to restrict an iOS app to iPad Pro only? As a developer of iOS software, is it possible to restrict an App to only be available on the iPad Pro?\nTo be more precise, the App we are considering should be restricted to the Apple Pencil, which is currently limited to the iPad Pro.\nIs there any way to restrict our App to those devices which support the Apple Pencil?\n\nA: Within Xcode you can specify that an app is iPad only under the \"Deployment Info\" section of the target's General settings.\nBeyond that the way to limit an app to certain devices is by specifying features in the Info.plist under the UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities key. You can see the options listed on Apple's developer website here: iOS Device Compatibility Reference\nUnfortunately there does not seem to be an option that limits an app to iPad Pro devices only. You can specify \"arm64\" which will limit your app to iPad mini second generation and above, iPad Airs and iPad Pro devices.

I'm not a expert by any means and am stuck with upgrading my MacBook Pro to Sierra. I checked all the sys reqs before I went ahead and made a full back up - all looked good to go.\nI downloaded Sierra from the App Store and followed the on-screen steps to set the upgrade in motion. Never had an issue updating OS so I went and made dinner and came back a bit later to find what appears to be the start up screen with the macOS Utilities window open asking me if I want to restore a Time Machine back up, reinstall macOS, get help online, or use the disk utility. So I'm not sure if there were any error messages during the process.\nI can't find any reference to this happening online - perhaps because it's super basic and everyone else knows what to do!\nI don't want to make it a bigger mess or do anything unnecessary like restore from back up if this is just a failed upgrade that if I restart all will be as if I hadn't tried to upgrade. I now have a sneaking suspicion that my existing operating sys might not have been the one able to go straight to Sierra. Would that have triggered an specific error message? Otherwise I have seen some reference to permissions being the issue - could that be the case?\nCan I fix this myself? Or should just take it into an Apple store and pay for support?\n\nA: It seems like your Mac is booted into the Recovery partition. Shut it down and try to boot it normally - it may not have upgraded at all. Then try the install again. If you have updates for your question, edit your question to add them and then comment on this answer so I notice.\nTo answer a few of the other questions you had:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would expect an error message to stick around, so you probably didn't miss one.\n\n*I doubt permissions would be an issue as you didn't see an error message.\n\n*If upgrading to Sierra was not supported, you probably wouldn't have been able to start the install.\n\n*You can almost certainly fix this yourself!

I have an iMac G3 that does not have a DVD drive, which was gifted to me along with install media for Mac OS 10.0-10.4. When I received it, it had Mac OS 10.4 on it, but I have since wiped the hard drive and am installing my way back up to it (I'm currently on 10.3).\nHowever, I'm not sure how to install Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger) since it comes on a DVD, but this iMac doesn't have a DVD drive. The original owner said something about how they put Tiger on an iPod to install it, but didn't remember the details. I could probably scrounge up an iPod if I need to, but I'd also be interested to know if there are other ways to install Tiger on a Mac without a DVD drive.\n\nA: If you are looking for old MacOS Versions you can go to the download site of https://developers.apple.com and get an old version of MacOS. I didn't see your particular 10.4 Version, but I did see 10.3.9 and 10.5 Leopard. \nThe different downloads can be found here. You can download them to your desktop and install it.\n\nA: You can get an 8 GB USB thumb drive. Format as APT/HFS+. Use Disk Utility on another Mac to image/restore the contents of the USB drive to the USB drive. Plug that drive in to the iMac and it should be bootable. It will be slow as all hell  because it may only be USB1.1 depending on the age. But it should work given enough time. \nOther alternatives including doing the same thing by partitioning the boot drive and using the extra partition volume. But on older Mac OS, you need to be booted off a different drive to cut up a drive, so that won't work for you. \nYou could also use a NetBoot server on another machine and boot the installer over ethernet. But I suspect that's not something you're set up for either.\nI think that USB option is it. If it's a newer model G3 iMac, maybe it has FireWire. Using a FireWire drive would be much more bearable. \n\nA: buy or loan an external DVD drive\n", "Q: How to present a keynote and start playing itunes music When I am in that full-screen mode presenting a keynote, using the iTunes media keys seems to just exit the keynote instead of playing a song from iTunes.\nHow can I play a song from iTunes whilst staying inside the keynote presenter?\n\nA: Keynote can play audio across all slides, but it needs to be inserted differently. Rather than using the Media button to insert audio you need to insert your audio via the Document icon and then click the Audio tab, and drop your audio tracking this way. \nThis audio then becomes a \"Soundtrack\" and will play across all slides in the presentation.\n\n\nA: Using Automator, AppleScript and a Keyboard Shortcut it is possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator\n\n*Create a new Service action\n\n*Make sure it receives 'no input' at all programs.\n\n*Drop a 'Run AppleScript' action in\n\n*Add this code: \n\n\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n   play track \"name-of-song-you-want-to-play\"\nend tell\n\n\n*Save Automator Service Action\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services\n\n*At the bottom under 'General' you will find the action you just created\n\n*Select that item\n\n*Push the 'Add Shortcut' button\n\n*Press the shortcut you want to use, for example Alt + CMD X\n\n\nWhen you are in fullscreen mode and arrive at slide 3.

I have had different issues with inputs since El Capitan. I frequently switches between Japanese and English. I don't know about Korean but in Japanese, you've got Katakana and Hinagana so I basically have 3 input turned on (but I don't think that's why I got the issue).\nAnd every now and then either Japanese or English input stops working. The flag at the right corner did change with keys. But the inputs themself don't.\nfor example. If I'm using pages, and switching between chrome and pages when I type something in English on chrome then switch back to pages to type something in Japanese, the language won't change even if the icon changed. and if this issue happened it stays.No matter what the icon is the actual input would be either English or Japanese.\nI have to reboot the mac to fix it, but it comes back a few hours after the machine is heavily used.\n\nA: I finally found a satisfactory way to temporarily fix this on my computer (running Sierra 10.12.6) WITHOUT REBOOTING!  Even opened an account on StackExchange to share :)\nFirst, my symptoms: at some point the keyboard stops switching between English and my OtherLanguage. It doesn't matter if I use a keyboard shortcut for switching or try to switch in the menu bar. What happens is I BRIEFLY see the flag of my OtherLanguage, and then when I try to type, it switches back to English.\nHowever... I noticed that this behaviour is application-specific. Some \"cooperative\" applications (in my case Terminal) still allow me to switch (using any method) AND STAY with the OtherLanguage layout. This gives me some hope...\nUnfortunately, in my case rebooting is not an option, so I kept experimenting. First, I quit the applications that were \"uncooperative\" (Safari, Mail, Skype, Slack). Brought them back again - no effect.\nThen I quit them again, switched to my trusty Terminal, CHANGED THE INPUT SOURCE and only then restarted Skype - Skype gave me my OtherLanguage back! Repeated the same with Slack - it worked too! Repeated with Safari - it worked again! Repeated with Mail - no way :(\nHowever I can live with that for the time being. For example, I can type my text in another application and just paste into my Mail as a temporary fix.\nHope it helps someone out there!\n\nA: In my case, running Big Sur on an M1-powered Macbook Air, the globe/fn key randomly stops responding.\nIn System Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts / Input Sources I found these:\n\n*\n\n*Select the previous input source: [control]-Space\n\n*Select the next source in input menu: [control]-[option]-Space\n\nThe first key combination doesn't actually seem to do anything I can notice, but the second not only switches between language keyboard layouts like the globe/fn key should, but it also makes the globe/fn key start working again.\n\nA: This bothered me for almost a whole year.

Currently, it's 75% full of TM backups for an ancient iMac that expired. I replaced it with a MacBook Pro. I don't need to keep any of the TM backups for the old iMac, BUT the TM backups contain a lot of iTunes music files that I want to save if I can. I spent a long time transferring my CD collection & I've no wish to start over. Ultimately, I hope to create an iTunes library on the external drive to free up space on the MacBook. There's currently little commonality between the old and new iTunes libraries, which is why I'm so keen to keep the old files.\nFor clarity, I don't need to keep any other parts of the TM backups just the iTunes music files.\nSo, do I need to delete the older backups to create space to save the iTunes files and then delete the last back up too? And if I just drag them into the trash and empty it, will that recover the space? Apart from the media files, I have no use for the backups now.\nAlthough I'm not a tech savvy person, I can usually follow instructions quite happily. I'll be grateful for advice from any quarter.\nThank you.\n\nA: Make sure you have all iTunes files on your Mac. Make one library with all music in it.

I have a Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch early 2015 model. It has the upgraded 3,1 GHz i7 dual-core in it.

Its just that the side bar is completely blank.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and after a quick Google search found my solution: I quit and restarted Calendar, clicked the Calendars button and the calendars list reappeared.\n\nA: menu->View->Show calendars is the menu point.\nperhaps the menu point underneath it \"Refresh Calendars\" ?\n", "Q: Problems creating a Live USB for OS X from Linux Fedora 25 I've been considering to move from OS X to Linux, because I want to have full control over the source code of the os and the apps I use, and Linux and open-source software allows me that in general, without having to go against the EULA.\nBearing this in mind, I installed Fedora 25 on my Mac. I created a Live USB, with the given app for OS X, which I used to boot. I had no problems doing so, but after a while I started feeling like the os was not only comprising my hardware stability, but also there were a few tiny little bugs, which I didn't want to mess around. Furthermore, two days after installing the os, I had problems with the boot loader, and I had to format the computer again. Furthermore, I don't have graphics acceleration in my graphics card, and the Planet CCRMA repositories, which were the main reason why I moved to fedora 25, don't seem to work on my install.\nBearing all of this in mind, I want to know how can I move back to OS X, creating an OS X installer thumb drive straight in Linux. I tried doing so throughout three possible ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried to run createinstallmedia from the installaton disk, which didn't work out (I currently have a hard drive in the place of the dvd drive) - the command for doing so doesn't run in Linux, because it cannot run the specific binaries.\n\n*I tried to create an install media with sudo dd if=x of=y, straight after using dmg2iso command but it turned out not to work, simply because this has to be done using the predeceasing bash utility.\n\n*Finally, I tried to use an app called UNetbootin, but for some reason, it doesn't recognize the USB disk I need to use as a target, making it worthless (probably the software is needing some maintainance to work fine on Fedora 25)\n\nA: thanks to klanomath, i realized that there was a much simpler way to fix this issue. it basically consists of: pressing alt command r in boot, to enter internet recovery. please notice that this will only work in macintosh computers released after 2010-2011. after doing so, the computer will connect to the internet and you will be able to download the stock version of your os from the cloud. after doing so, install it, then boot into the os. if it is like a really old version, you can boot into recovery mode (now installed). and download the latest version. if this procedure doesn't work, you can also download the latest version of macosx, and using createinstallmedia command in installation media, and install the latest version of osx\n", "Q: Constant script/application for shared drive checking/mounting I'm wondering where's a good place to start for this problem. I believe it might be achieved using apple script but admittedly I don't know its capabilities.\nScenario: I have a NAS which I log in to using Finder. Once logged in there are two folders on the NAS, when I click one of the folders \"SNAS\" it mounts it on root (i.e., if I CMD+UP ARROW to the top, it's listed next to other drives). I then drag it into my favourites list.\nWhen the Mac is rebooted the connection and favourite is lost and I have to repeat the process.\nI want a script to run automatically on each boot, and then periodically (say, every 30 seconds or so). The script should check if the NAS is logged in, if not, log in to it. Check if the folder/drive is mounted, if not, mount it. Then check if it's on the list of favourites, and if not, favourite it.\nIn effect automatically logging in, mounting, and favouriting the NAS folder/drive each time.\nHappy to do the leg work on the script but if anyone has a suggestion for where to start/language to use/or even possibly a dedicated application that would be great as I can't find anything for the niche request on searches\nI've attached a run of images showing the current steps being taken.\nOS details: macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2555)\n\n\nA: You can do this in the shell.\nLaunch a Terminal, then run:\nmount\n\nFind the line with your volume, and grab the first part up until the space. \nIt should look something like:\n//warren@10.0.15.2/Shared%20Network%20Volume\n\nThats username@IP_OF_NAS/VolumeName\nNow here is the script, save it as \"remount.sh\"\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndate\nmounted=$(/sbin/mount | grep -c \"VOLUMENAME\")\nif [ $mounted -eq 0 ]; then\n   ping -q -c 2 -t 1 IP_ADDRESS > /dev/null 2>&1\n   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n      if [ ! -d \"/Volumes/VOLUMENAME\" ]; then\n         mkdir \"/Volumes/VOLUMENAME\"\n         chown LOCALLOGIN:staff \"/Volumes/VOLUMENAME\"\n      fi\n     su LOCALLOGIN -c \"/sbin/mount -t afp afp://YOURLOGIN:PASSWORD@IP_ADDRESS/VOLUMENAME /Volumes/VOLUMENAME\"\n   fi\nelse\n   echo \"Already mounted\"\n\nfi\n\nYou need to change the variables in all CAPS above.\nYOURLOGIN (Your login on the NAS)\nPASSWORD (Your password on the NAS)\nLOCALLOGIN (Your local login on the MAC machine)\nIP_ADDRESS (the IP ADDRESS of the NAS)\nVOLUMENAME (The Volume Name on the NAS)\n\nUnmount the network volume that you previously mounted, then run:\nchmod 755 remount.sh\nsudo ./remount.sh\n\nMake sure this mounts the volume OK.  It worked fine on my MacBook running Sierra against an Apple Time Capsule.\nNow if all is well, we add it to cron to run it as root (sudo) every 15 minutes.\nsudo crontab -e\n\nAdd something like this (season to taste):\n*/15 * * * * /Users/warren/remount.sh >> /Users/warren/remount.log 2>&1\n\nYou'll note I saved the script in my home directory.  If you are tidy, you probably don't want to save it there.\nDismount the volume, and wait 15 minutes and see if it reappears.  If not, look at the log file to see whats up.\n", "Q: How do I send a set of youtube URLs from a Mac to the youtube app on Apple TV? On my Macbook I note a series of youtube URLs that I would like to watch, sometime.\nThey are extended documentaries, and so I'd like to watch them on the TV. The TV is hooked to an Apple TV (4th gen).\nI could of course use the youtube app on the Apple TV to search again for the URLs, but this is terribly tedious. It's a task best done on a computer.\nHow do I send a set of youtube URLs from a Mac to the youtube app on Apple TV?\nYes, I am aware that I could use AirPlay. But doing so inevitably requires me to run back and forth between the Mac and the Apple TV.\nI could also send the URLs via Google Keep to my iPad, and AirPlay from the iPad to the Apple TV, but I'm hoping there is a way that turns the Apple TV into a standalone device, without requiring me to type the URLs by hand.\n\nA: In your Apple TV YouTube app, you should see an option to activate.. To login to your YouTube account.  Once you follow the instructions displayed on your TV, you should then be logged into your YouTube account and on your TV you can see your favorites and playlists etc.  \n", "Q: Proper way to connect a macbook to an external monitor I have a macbook air and a 1440 IPS monitor that I usually connect to. However, I'm a bit concerned because sometimes the monitor screen becomes a bit distorted (ants on screen). It usually takes one or two on/off switches to get it working as expected. This only happens when I connect to the monitor for the first time.\nI'm not sure what the actual problem is. It could be the macbook, the expensive thunderbolt to dvi adapter, or the monitor. Although I have been using this setup for over a year, I'm worried that it may be harmful in the long run. A bit paranoid, I know.\nWhat I usually do is hook up my running macbook to the monitor. When I'm done, I disconnect it while it's running. Is there any harm in doing this? Or is there a proper way that will minimize damage (e.g., booting up the macbook while connected to the monitor)?\n\nA: No, there shouldn't be any harm in doing that. Thunderbolt is hot-swap so you can insert and remove the cable at any time while the machine is running.\nGoing from Thunderbolt to DVI shouldn't require an expensive adapter. Thunderbolt 1 and 2 includ\n", "Q: Is it possible to use an iMac in Target Display mode with a 2016 MacBook Pro with USB-C? Before they went Retina, iMacs could be used as displays in Target Display Mode. Is this possible with the new Touch Bar / USB-C MacBook Pros (late 2016) via the USB-C ports? They don't have a Mini DisplayPort-style Thunderbolt 1-2 port, and the support article about connecting various things to the USB-C ports doesn't mention an iMac. Neither does the article that explains what can and can't be used with the USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 adapter.\n\nA: My 13\" 2016 MacBook Pro drives my late 2009 27\" iMac's display using a third-party USB-C to Mini DisplayPort adaptor. \n\nA: Yes. I have gotten this to work with a 15\" Touch Bar MacBook Pro (Late 2016) and a 2011 27\" iMac. You need the USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 adapter and a Thunderbolt cable. It will not work with a Mini-DisplayPort cable, which is the same physical plug but not the same protocol.\n\nA: Don't confuse a USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 port with USB only as the new MacBook Pro do have thunderbolt and not simply USB-C. The new MacBook Pro can output to a Mini DisplayPort target display mode compatible Mac with either a cable that connects directly or an adapter to the existing cable you would have used with the Mac.\nI would probably go with a USB-C to MiniDisplayport and use the display port over USB-C protocol since that cable is less expensive than a thunderbolt adapter and would also work with a MacBook (non Pro and non Thunderbolt) or other USB only device. There's probably no speed benefit of thunderbolt for this application.\n\n\n*\n\n*USB-C to Displayport - $30 or so street price\n\n*Displayport to miniDP adapter - $5 or so street price\nIf you wanted thunderbolt - then you'd get Apple's Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter - $30 on sale this month and use any standard thunderbolt cable.\nI used to believe all iMacs that support Target Display mode will take mini display port signal in - but some people report you need thunderbolt for some Macs. I have no reason to doubt them - so be sure you can return a DP cable if you buy one for this. Some iMacs support both thunderbolt as well as mini DP. Not all iMacs with either port support Target Display mode - especially the new 4k and 5k iMacs - they don't support any video input so you would need a software screen sharing solution for them.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592 - Use your iMac as a display with Target Display Mode\n\n\nA: Yes, I have connected my Late 2016 Macbook Pro using a USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 adapter (from Apple) to my Late 2012 27\" iMac using a Thunderbolt cable (from Apple). Target Display Mode works the same as with my previous MacBook Pro (Late 2013).\nThe only issue so far is that the volume slider won't appear on my Touchbar for controlling the iMac's volume.\n\nA: Yes, I'm successfully running a setup with a 2017 13\" MacBook Pro and a 2011 iMac. The original Apple USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter works fine for Target Display Mode. Also the Touchbar volume slider works fine for iMac volume.\n", "Q: Restore iOS 10 backup to an old iPhone 4s I just broke my iPhone 5s running iOs 10.1.1 and I would like to restore a back-up to an old iPhone 4s that I own.\niTunes claims that the iOS version is too recent to restore it. Is there a way to tweak/downgrade the backup in order to avoid using the iCloud backup?\n\nA: You can't restore a backup of a newer iOS version to an older iOS version.\nHowever, you can examine the contents of the backup using iBackupBot and then manually restore what you can using iBackupBot's restore mechanism. This won't restore incompatible databases such as your messages, but you can usually restore app data.\n", "Q: Fully disable Spotlight Search I would like to know if there is any way to disable Spotlight Search, even when an user goes to Settings -> Spotlight Search, and change the options there.\nThat's mainly because anyone could still search in Spotlight only by going to Settings -> Spotlight and enabling the search on the web. I do know that you can set it so you can apply filters, but they are not successfull at what I need. (Yes, I know also that Safari can be restricted under \"Restrictions\", but I am only talking about Spotlight)\nI would need something like \"Spotlight Search\" under \"Restrictions\", so I can turn it off completely, so any user can't enable the Internet search again.\nThat's like a little bug for anyone who want to be fully protected for mature/adult content. (I want to have my own filter, not what Apple says that is good)\nPS. Currently I am with iOS 10.X in an iPhone SE. There's a video from youtube here that explains how to disable Settings app. That would be great, but that workaround only work in older versions of iOS.\n\nA: First, reboot into recovery by restarting your Mac while holding down Cmd+R. From Utilities, select Terminal and enter the following command to disable System Integrity Protection.\n\ncsrutil disable\n\nTo check if it is already disabled, run csrutil status.\n\nNow, just run this: \nmv /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle /System/Library/CoreServices/Search_disabled.bundle\n\nThen restart your Mac and Spotlight will be completely disabled.\nDon't forget to re-enable System Integrity Protection once your are done.\n\nA: Okay, sounds to me like your friend wants to totally prevent search engines while at the same time allowing most websites. In other words, no Google, no Bing, no Yahoo, no Baidu, no AOL, no Ask.com, and the list could go on and on.\nIf my understanding is right, then the best option to cover all bases would be to do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings \n\n*Tap General\n\n*Tap on Spotlight Search\n\n*Disable Siri Suggestions, Suggestions in Search, Suggestions in Look Up\n\n*Exit Spotlight Search\n\n*Exit General\n\n*Tap on Siri\n\n*Either disable Siri totally OR disable Access on Lock Screen\n\n*Exit Siri\n\n*Tap on General\n\n*Tap on Restrictions\n\n*Enter a restrictions passcode\n\n*Swipe up until you see the list of ALLOWED CONTENT options\n\n*Tap on Websites\n\n*Tap on Limit Adult Content\n\n*Tap on Add a website... under the NEVER ALLOW heading\n\n*Enter google.com and tap Done\n\n*Repeat step 17 for any other search engines he wants to restrict\n\n*Exit Websites and return to the main Restrictions screen\n\n*Swipe down to see the top of the screen\n\n*Disable Siri & Dictation\n\n*Exit Restrictions\n\n\nNow, the above is total overkill, but should do what he wants. He can then go back and re-enable certain things if this is disabling more than he wanted.\n[UPDATE]\nIn newer versions of iOS, the various Siri options at Step 4 are now located at Settings > Siri & Search.\n\nA: In this exact order, this is how to disable Spotlight Search on the iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to SETTINGS\n\n*Go to GENERAL\n\n*Click on RESTRICTIONS\n\n*Disable RESTRICTIONS\n\n*Now, In the regular SETTINGS, go to SIRI AND SEARCH - and then scroll until you see SIRI SUGGESTIONS\n\n*Under SIRI SUGGESTIONS Turn OFF SUGGESTIONS IN SEARCH and  SUGGESTIONS IN LOOKUP\n\n*Scroll back up a little and Turn OFF PRESS HOME FOR SIRI\n\n*Now go back  to RESTRICTIONS and ENABLE them\n\n*In RESTRICTIONS turn off SIRI AND DICTATION\n\n*Scroll down a little bit (still in restrictions) and under ALLOWED CONTENT click on SIRI and TURN OFF EXPLICIT LANGUAGE and WEB SEARCH CONTENT\nIf you followed these directions in exact order, you can disable “Spotlight search” and will not be able to turn it back on unless you know the restrictions passcode for the phone.\n", "Q: How do you rotate inserts in Apple Mac OS preview 7? It happens that I noticed a text insert I had  pasted in an  image in Preview 7 (Sierra on MacBookAir had been rotated\nI don't know how this happened but the text insert is definitely not horizontal.\nSo there must be a way to rotate inserts. I haven't yet found out.\nCan anyone tell me?\n\nA: You can rotate inserts and annotations, like text boxes, rectangles or signatures, by arbitrary angles:\nHold the Command ⌘ key and rotate the selected annotation with two fingers on a trackpad. \nAs far as I know this only works with trackpads and is undocumented. It works on macOS High Sierra.\nThis is from an apple communities question: How can I rotate the text box in Preview\n\nA: Rotating with command + the trackpad (per the other answer) worked for me, but only after I enabled the \"rotate\" gesture in System Preferences > Trackpad (see screenshot) (OS X 10.14 Mojave)\n\n", "Q: Copying files from a damaged Mac – Finder or CCC? I have a Mac which can't boot up (it sees the prohibitory sign when it's turned on). I am going to do a clean reinstall of macOS on it. I want to keep the data somewhere, of course, so I don't lose all my files.\nSince the Mac is damaged, do I need to make a clone of the drive (using Carbon Copy Cloner) or will a simply copy and paste of the drive to the target drive from the Finder do? I don't need the copied data to form a bootable drive, as it is damaged anyway. I just want to keep the personal files and folders intact, and perhaps the applications as well so I know what I had installed on the drive.\nP.S. I'd rather not use CCC or any external programs if that's possible. I'm running macOS off a USB drive and it's incredibly slow, so third-party software is merely a hindrance. \n\nA: Using disk Utility’s restore function, you can clone a drive. It is a built in app in the utilities folder inside of the applications folder.\n\nA: If you have a functioning copy of macOS running from a USB you can still set up Time Machine to backup your internal drive to the target drive. This would be your best option to ensure you're capturing a full backup, alhough of course the first backup will take quite some time. However, just copying and pasting all your data would also take some time.\nYou could just do a copy and paste within Finder from your internal drive to target drive, but you do risk missing data that you may not want to lose. For example, if you use the default macOS Mail app, all the emails etc are stored in the User's library folder.\n", "Q: Wireless Mouse Lag I have a mid-2014 MBP retina that runs OSX El Capitan (10.11.6). I'm trying to use my wireless Logitech mouse (Anywhere MX, the first edition), but there is an intermittent lag problem. Sometimes it lags so much that the cursor does not move smoothly across the screen. There doesn't seem to be a particular app that's running that causes it. Here's what I know:\n\n\n*\n\n*I suspect the mouse isn't the problem because the issue repeats with another wireless Logitech mouse.\n\n*When I switch to an old wired mouse, the problem disappears.\n\n*A reboot sometimes works.\n\n*I did not observe a particular trend in memory usage while this happens. In other words, the rest of the system functions ok. The trackpad works fine.\nHow can I diagnose the problem?\n\nA: Radio Frequency Interference\nThere does exist a problem with radio interference when using 2.4 GHz devices (Logitech Unifying Receiver / Bluetooth) along with a USB 3.x peripheral connected to the computer. This interference is known to cause significant lag in the mouse response (Intel, 2012). I would begin by investigating if this issue applies to you before moving on to other sources. \nSimply identify if any USB 3.x peripherals are connected. If so, disconnect them and consider if the cursor movement changes. The USB 3.x issue causes erratic behavior in the cursor which should then be gone (Logitech, 2014). Remedies can then be taken such as changing up the USB port usage, and moving the mouse receiver closer to the mouse.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Display Freezing Yesterday I started experiencing display hiccups in my new Macbook Pro\n\nThe issue is most noticeable when playing videos, though it really effects every animation: minimizing windows, switching screens, even typing is now choppy. The display has hiccups where it freezes for a split second, making it very choppy. I get lots of warning from WindowServer in my console (snippet here). I've tried several solutions so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting\n\n*Disabling automatic brightness\n\n*Resetting my user keychain\n\n*Disabling iCloud keychain\n\n*Removing all user LaunchAgents\n\n*Turning WiFi off and on again\n\n\nbut none of them have worked. I'd really like to avoid a full OS reinstallation and from what I can see, I'm not the only one experiencing this issue. It appears to be related to the 10.12.1 update. \n\nA: Troubleshooting is basically a process of elimination and often requires patience. Below I have some steps for you to try and report back on.\n1. Safe Mode\nWhat happens when you run your computer in Safe Mode? To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shutdown your computer\n\n*Restart your computer and immediately hold down the Shift key\n\n*Once you're logged in, use the computer for long enough to establish if you still have the problem.\n\n*Fully shutdown your computer again\n\n*Restart your computer normally\n\n*Once you're logged in, use the computer for long enough to establish if you still have the problem.\n\n\nOnce you've done the above, report back on how your computer was in Safe Mode and how it was again when not in Safe Mode.\n2. Reset your NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this. Here’s how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\n3. Reset the SMC\nYour computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can also be reset. The instructions for doing this on your particular MacBook are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter resetting both your NVRAM and SMC, use your computer and report back on how it's now going.\n", "Q: Slow Mac mini (mid 2011) no hardware issues, no software issues Mac Mini mid 2011 (5,1) 2.3 GHz i5, 2 GB ram running 10.12.1 with 149/500 GB free.\nIn application monitor everything (memory, disk, network, cpu usage) is nominal.\nDisk check (Cmd+R at boot) - Passed\nHardware test (opt+D at boot) - Passed.\nOn boot the screen goes white after 45 seconds (half of the boot loading bar) and the dock shows up after about 5 minutes.

However I don't think that would normally cause quite the amount of speed reduction as you have reported.\nNevertheless, for a quick speed boost, I would definitely recommend upgrading to 8 GB of RAM. Apple has information on how to upgrade, just make sure that the RAM you get is compatible with Apple's specifications. For example an 8 GB RAM kit from Crucial should work.\nAdditionally, I do know that HDDs can be a speed bottle neck, especially as they get more full and are older. You can upgrade to an SSD (here's a guide by Crucial), however that is a far more complicated process, and you will also need to transfer all your software from the old HDD.\nBut your speeds are very slow, so there is probably some software problem. You can try to diagnose that by going to System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items and see if you have programs loading at boot. Also if you can check Activity Monitor, that may show if something is using a lot of your CPU.

Often, I find myself wanting to move an object (and/or scale and rotate it), and have it remain in its new position when I advance to the next slide.\nTo do this, I end up making a new slide, and then creating a new copy of the object, positioned at the approximate location of where its action builds finished. Since I have to position it manually there's often quite a bit of fiddling around involved in getting the build to line up with the object's position on the new slide.\nSo I'm wondering if there's a way to do that automatically. In other words, I want to create a new slide that's a copy of what the previous slide looks like after all the builds are completed. Or alternatively, I want to create a copy of an object, but scaled and repositioned to line up with its location after all of its action builds.\nIs it possible to do that in the current version of Keynote, or is my fiddly workaround the only way?\n\nA: Here's a self-answer, which I didn't know about when I wrote the question. Keynote has a \"magic move\" feature, which allows objects to move from initial positions on one slide to final positions on the next. This is a bit more limited than using action builds, because you don't have control over build order. (Objects always all move simultaenously, and the moves must all take the same duration.) However, you can use it in combination with action builds, in which case the \"magic move\" transition will animate the objects moving from their final positions on the first slide to their initial positions on the second. \nYou can also simply chain 'magic move' transitions together, building an animation up out of multiple slides. In some ways this is easier than building the animation up out of actions, though it does have the disadvantage that if you want to make a change you have to manually change every slide in the animation.\nI've found that with a bit of careful thought I can achieve all the effects I want in a fairly convenient way.\nTo use this feature, you have to use CMD-D to duplicate a slide, then move the objects to where you want them on each slide, and then select \"magic move\" as a transition effect between the two slides. For more details, see the link above.\n", "Q: How iPad can run terminal as linux system? If I want to develop software on an iPad, how to start a terminal like linux and save the source local?\n\nA: Without jailbreaking you can't really. iOS is designed not to allow executables to be created or even files to be moved between apps. Also there is no terminal.\nIf you want to build apps for iOS you generally use code on a mac.\nHowever there are some apps that allow programming on the iPad but all run inside the app. Examples of this include Swift Playgrounds from Apple and various interpreters for Python, Javascript and Lua. (I have not provided links as I have not used them and my quick search found low rated or old apps) there are also interpreters that you can build on the Mac and install like Pharo ( a version of smalltalk).\n", "Q: How do I remove an installed .pkg file I recently installed this \"CH341 Driver\" so that I could connect my new chinese Arduino. \nBut when I plug the USB cable, connected to the Arduino, into my computer it crashes immediately. A few moments later a message pops up that tells me that, because of a problem, the computer had to restart. \nNow I want to delete this installed driver and download another driver or another version of it. But in order to do so I need to delete the old software (which makes my computer crash). \nI looked around on the internet about how to do so, but most of the googled suggestions tell me that I can simply remove it from the \"Applications\" folder. It isn't a program so that won't help. I also found a few results that tell me to open terminal, enter the command \"pkgutil --pkgs\", search for the package and enter the command \"sudo pkgutil --forget the-package-name.pkg\". \nBut I can't find the package name in the list. So I went to \"About this Mac\" -> \"System Report...\" -> \"Software\" -> \"Installations\" and there I can see the names of the packages, but unfortunately I can't remove them from there.\nSo is there anybody who can tell me where I can remove them? \n\nA: You can check what was installed and remove it manually. Copy the *.pkg file to some empty tmp folder. Then:\nxar -xf YOUPACKAGE.pkg\n\nThen print the content of the Bom file with:\n lsbom $(find . -name Bom)\n\nYou'll have the list of files like: (Here's the part for Cisco AnyConnect)\n./opt/cisco/vpn 40755   0/0\n./opt/cisco/vpn/bin 40755   0/0\n\nAll file path start with . but they are installed relative to the root folder (/).

Or can I just use Python thats already installed like as if i just installed it myself\n\nA: Python has been installed on the Mac far back, though some of the earlier versions of the OS will have particularly old versions of Python. You can discover the installed version of Python by running python -V at the command line. MacOS 10.11.6 has Python 2.7.10 installed.\nIf you want Python 3 or a later version of Python 2.7 then I would recommend using either Homebrew or Anaconda (if you want Python with a bunch of bells and whistles pre-installed) to install it. Homebrew and Anaconda currently install Python 2.7.12\n\nA: Yes, python has been on MacOS (OS X) since day 1. Some parts of the OS rely on python scripts, and these have stayed the same for many years. For instance, the Automator actions for Combining and watermarking PDFs have python scripts at their core.\nThe benefit of writing for the system-installed version is that you know it will work on a wide range of Macs: I have written python scripts that work on every OS from Leopard (c. 2007) to Catalina, with no extra installations or modifications!\nPython2 has now been end-of-lined, and Catalina is the last version to include it (so Apple say). Catalina comes with python3, but the OS may not come with any python version in the future.\nIMO, it's easiest to download the installer package from python.org for updates to either python2 or python3. \n", "Q: Can autologin be set up from the command line? how?

Where is the list of sidebar's favourites stored in macOS Sierra?\nI tried to delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.applde.finder.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/com.applde.sidebarlist.plist - almost all preferences are reset except list of favourites - it remains\n\nA: The sidebar's favourites are managed by sharedfilelistd which is an XPC service, don't try to manipulate it manually. This way lies pain and suffering.\n\nA: Thanks to @TonyWilliams for the starting point and after a brief research I realized that requested sidebar's favourites are stored actually in directory ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/, the file com.apple.LSSharedFileList.FavoriteItems.sfl among other files which are responsible for other sidebar sections.

Three of our lightning cables have stopped working when plugged into the wall. We both get a message \"This accessory may not be supported\". These are not cables purchased from Apple, but they have worked until a few days ago.\nHowever, when we plug the phone directly into our laptops using these cables, they still charge fine.\nWe have a fourth cable that seems to work perfectly, both in the wall socket and our computers.\nCan someone explain why this is the case? Are these cables all broken, or is there a way to fix the three broken cables?\n\nEDIT: Coming back to this question after a few weeks where I have some more information to provide. I don't think it changes the answer below, but it definitely raises more questions for me.\nIt seems that the problem occurs in my house only. These power cords seem to be fine in my office and in a few other places that I have tried. Also, some of the broken cords are original (but older) lightning cables and some of the working ones are knockoffs. \nMy guess is that the difference has something to do with the wiring in my home. And it's just pure luck that some cheaper cables work while others don't. I wonder if there is something about the wiring in my home that could be causing this.\n\nA: It's not that surprising - a lot of 3rd party accessories aren't of a very high quality, and some of them don't support all functions. \nFor example, there are many Lightning cables on the market that support charging, but not data transfer. \nAnother example is some speakers support charging of iDevices, while some only support the transfer of audio data.\nThe quality of the cable can impact the amount of charge travelling through it and how many devices it will or won't work with. Some cables deteriorate faster than others, meaning they stop working with some devices and not others, or just stop working totally.\nAlso, sometimes it isn't the cable, but the charger or accessory it is connected to. \nAnother variable is the amount of current going through the cable - it's quite likely that the current from your chargers is higher than your laptop (especially if they're Windows laptops).\nRegardless of the cause/reason, I've seen your scenario occur many times and sometimes disconnecting and reconnecting the cable a few times gets it to work, but it's certainly not a cable I would trust any more. And they wouldn't be worth trying to fix either.\nI'd keep them for as long as they work with your laptops, but would otherwise replace them and ensure you buy cables from a reputable source/brand. \n", "Q: Can I install OSX 10.11 El Capitan on a 2016 MacBook Pro touch?

Sierra has always felt very sluggish to me, and it is the first OSX release where apps consistently crash. El Capitan was much more solid in my opinion and I would like to downgrade. Is there any reason why I shouldn't?\n\nA: No you can't install El Capitan.\nThe firmware won't allow any version of macOS earlier than macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2657) to be installed.\nAlso, for future reference, if this model ever needs a firmware update, it is possible that the earliest version of macOS you will be able to install in future will be a version later than macOS 10.12.1.\n", "Q: How to map function key (F1-F12) to perform like they do with builtin keyboard on Macbook I have an USB external keyboard but the Fn(1-12) keys are kinda useless.

I have an iMac 5k, late 2015, with a Fusion Drive consisting of a 2TB hard disc and a 128GB SSD. I want to upgrade the SSD by buying a third-party one.\nWhat specs should the third-party SSD have to fit in and work with the iMac? NVMe? PCIe? mSATA? M2?\nThere are two parts to this: it needs to have the right physical connector that fits into the Mac motherboard, and it needs to speak a protocol the Mac speaks. What are the requirements for each?\nIf I choose an SSD that speaks the SATA protocol, will it still work with my Mac, or must I get a PCIe one? I'm not worried about a slight difference in speed, since both are much faster than a spinning hard disc.\n\nA: Your model iMac has a Serial ATA (6 Gb/s) connector for a 2.5\" hard drive and a PCIe connector (PCIe 2.0 x4 NVMexpress interface) for the SSD.\nFor best compatibility I suggest you purchase your SSD from a reputable retailer. For example, the following are some well-regarded sites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Sales \n\n*Simply Mac\n\n*RAM City\n\n*Macfixit\nBy buying from a reputable store you'll be sure to get an SSD fit for purpose, regardless of manufacturer. Being reputable means they're only going to sell something that works and they'll stand behind the product they sell, regardless of the brand.\nAlso, many sites offer an easy interface to ensure you select the right SSD for your particular Mac.\n\nA: I suggest that you also look at external storage solutions as a much simpler and cheaper alternative, with minimal performance sacrifices. \nWhile my search is by no means exhaustive, I could not find instances of people installing a third-party PCIe SSD in the iMac 5K Late 2015. None of the websites Monomeeth suggested sells a PCIe SSD for the iMac 5K Late 2015, either. Unless compatibility is confirmed, I'd rather not spend money on a PCIe NVMe SSD (expensive), take my iMac apart (difficult and risky), only to find out that it won't work. \nEven if there exists such products, they might be Apple proprietary and carry a hefty price premium. In contrast, USB 3.0 external enclosure and SATA SSD are both competitive markets. You have a broad range of products to choose from with wide availability. \nIf it narrows down to SATA SSDs, the performance difference between internal and external via USB 3.0 becomes very small. You are either limited by SATA 3.0 (6Gbps) or USB 3.0 (5Gbps). In return, you get a much easier upgrade. As you are probably aware of, the iMac 5K Late 2015 disassembly and reassembly is very difficult. I consider it a big plus not having to take an iMac 5K apart and put it back together, although you might enjoy the process and consider it its own reward.\nIf you have the budget and can find the right PCIe NVMe SSD, go for it. If not, a high quality USB 3.0 SATA enclosure and a good SATA SSD e.g. 850 EVO/PRO will make you just as happy while saving you a lot of time and trouble.\n", "Q: Using too much of Hotspot hurts the iPad? I have a iPad mini2 (cellular). Recently my modem has been broken and to use the internet via my laptop I use a personal hotspot connection.

Now I want to know, should I stop doing that? would it hurts my ipad? \nYou know, I feel the connection has slowed recently, I mean when I turn personal hotspot on in my ipad, it takes 1 min to my laptop find it and connect to it. I think that happened faster already.\n\nA: \nShould I stop doing that?\n\nThe only reason you may want to stop is to avoid going over your cellular data limit (if any).\n\nWill it hurt my iPad?\n\nNo, this wont \"hurt\" your iPad, however it's a process that requires the iPad to work a bit harder than normal, meaning you can expect these while you are using the hotspot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shorter battery life for the iPad\n\n*Slower Performance on the iPad\n\n*Slower internet speeds than usual for all devices\n\n", "Q: Switching between applications always hides other apps When switching between applications how does one allow applications to stack or remain in view? \nExample: I have a web browser open (not in full screen but sized to cover the full display) I then open the calendar which is sized smaller and used to appear in front of the browser in previous OS versions whilst still displaying the web browser behind it. \nWhat occurs for me is that when I switch applications the previous application is hidden to the dock, not minimized but hidden.\nHere is a short gif as I have most likely explained my problem terribly.\n\n\nA: Do you have Keyboard Maestro installed?

The problem is, even though services are under application's File menu item, I have to invoke it manually the first time, then I can use the key combination. Is there a way to be able use services when you first launch the application? I looked at this answer, but I'd rather use a 3rd party application only if I absolutely have to.\n\nA: You can make this work with launchd. This requires two steps: First creating a script that invokes your service(s), and second creating a LaunchAgent plist file that will call the script at launch.\nFirst step: Creating a script that invokes your service(s)\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a text file with the following content, where ~/Library/Services/myservice.workflow points to the service you want to start (if you want to start more than one service, repeat the second line pointing to the different services):\n#!/bin/bash\nautomator ~/Library/Services/myservice.workflow\n\n\n*Save the file, e.g. as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.launchmyservice.sh\n\n*Make it executable by issuing the following command in the Terminal:\nchmod u+x ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.launchmyservice.sh\n\nSecond step: Creating a LaunchAgent plist that calls the script\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a text file with the following content. You need to adapt the string /Users/myusername/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.launchmyservice.sh so it points to the script created in the first step. You cannot use a relative path with ~.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>me.myname.launchmyservice</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/Users/myusername/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.launchmyservice.sh</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\n*Save the text file to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.update-desktop-from-webcam.plist – the name should match the \"Label\" key in the file.\n\n*Load it by issuing the following command:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.update-desktop-from-webcam.plist\n\n", "Q: Trying to reinstall OS Sierra I've a Mac Mini and I tried to reinstall Sierra yesterday.\n\n\n*\n\n*I used Command + R at the log screen\n\n*Erased my Hard Drive\n\n*Click on Reinstall macOS Sierra\n\n\nBut when it was close to finish my internet dropped because of the rain and the reinstall failed. I tried again but nothing happened, so I restarted and now I can't access the recovery screen. My Mac boots directly to a grey folder with a question mark and the Command + R doesn't work.\nWhat can I do now?\n\nA: Internet recovery does depend on the network - so if your network was what made the first Command+R boot work, you will need to get back to a working network.\nMost Macs don't erase the local recovery HD so you wouldn't likely have \"shot a gun towards your own foot\" if you simply erased the Macintosh HD and you would still be able to boot to recovery locally. \nOnly if you repartitioned the entire physical volume would you have erased your own recovery.\nAs to the fix - you could make a recovery drive on another Mac that is working and has an internet connection or take your Mac to a working network and try internet recovery.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I boot into Internet Recovery on a iMac?\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202481 - lists the network requirements for internet recovery\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904 - how to reinstall macOS \n\n", "Q: Calendar stuck on 'edit event' screen My I Phone 5 calendar is stuck on Edit Event -won't allow me to save the event it is displaying or delete the event  What can I do?\n\nA: Try quitting the app. Double-click the home button, then swipe up on the Calendar app. Return to the home screen and open Calendar again.\n", "Q: Changing system passwords without changing user password Is it possible to change the passwords for ssh, vnc, sudo et.c. without changing the password I use to log in?\nIf so, how can I do it?\n(Mac with Sierra)\n\nA: No - there is no system password, just one password for each and every user you define in the system.\nThe first user is an administrator, and they get sudo permissions out of the box. You can add passwords and users behind the scenes, in front of the scenes and have multiple user/password combinations so that you can issue one for remote use if that suits your needs and hide that user from the GUI.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203998 - sudo dscl . create /Users/hiddenuser IsHidden 1\nVNC is the oddball, you can change that out of the box to have a \"system\" password but that's less secure than using an account password unless you don't need to know who is connecting remotely.

Unfortunately, I don't have sound and I don't have 1920x1080 screen resolution :(\nMy question is: What i need to do to repair this?\nAnd if i need to install other bootcamp drivers, how do I delete the old bootcamp?\n\nA: Sounds like you have a driver issue. I suggest reinstalling Bootcamp from Apple's website.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you aren't currently in the Windows 10 partition, restart the computer and navigate into Windows 10.\n\n*Download this from Apple's website (https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1638?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) \n\n\n\nThis download is specific to your 2011 iMac but you can easily find\n  downloads for other macs by navigating to support.apple.com/downloads\n  and searching for \"bootcamp\". To determine if a bootcamp package is compatible, look under the \"system requirements\" link.\n\n\n\n*Extract the zip file to your directory of choice.\n\n*Navigate to BootCamp5.0.5033\\BootCamp\\setup.exe and run the setup.exe file\n\n*Close all other programs while this runs.\n\n*After the installer completes, restart the computer and reenter Windows 10\n\n*To ensure the latest drivers and software, run Apple Software update from within Windows 10.\n\n\nHope this helps you. Let me know what happens.\n\nA: Windows 10 drivers on your Mac are essential to ensure your Mac runs properly on Windows 10. However, if the Mac drivers are outdated, missing, corrupted, damaged, or incompatible after a Windows 10 installation (or update), your Mac  and other devices connected to it will not work properly on Windows 10. \nWhen it comes to Windows Bootcamp installations, I always take the approach that “if it ain’t broken, don't fix it”. In your case though, it's worth checking for driver issues. The best way to do this is by downloading and updating to the latest Mac drivers.  The two options I've seen used most often to achieve this are:\nOption 1 - Use the Apple Software Update for Windows to install any available driver updates for Windows 10. However, it doesn't always work well and I've read that some drivers are not available via this method. Also, you may need to be patient for it to update any necessary drivers as it can take hours. Because of these reasons, the next approach is often used.\nOption 2 - Use one of the many utilities that enable you to update drivers for Windows installations. Driver Talent is one of these utilities and it can help repair any Mac drivers that are corrupted or damaged. It will also download and install any Windows 10 Mac drivers that are missing or outdated. Note there are both free and pro versions available. However, the free version is all you should need.\nNOTE: I have no affiliation whatsoever with the Driver Talent software. I mention it only because I have seen it resolve issues with Windows Bootcamp installations.\nReset SMC\nFinally, I have seen instances where resetting the SMC actually helps in terms of VRAM and Bootcamp partitions (although this is a surprise to me, I've seen it with my own eyes). So, doing this may help in terms of your screen resolution, although ensuring you have the latest drivers (as described above) should resolve your issue. To reset the SMC on your iMac, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Unplug it from the power\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds\n\n*Plug it back in and turn it on.\n\n\nUseful resources - You may find the following resource of interest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Windows 10 on your Mac with Boot Camp\n\nA: Windows 8.1 and 10 are designed to automatically find, download, and install drivers in the background for your device after an install. Double check in Settings -> Update and Security  that updates are automatically being installed. Updates can be large, so download speeds affect how quick this will be. \nOften enough, you just have to connect to your network and wait it out.  Go to the update section in settings to check for updates if it suits you.\n", "Q: Restoring messages from backup not working I tried restoring the folder ~/Library/Messages, and ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat, but when I opened Messages every single Message but the last was gone for every conservation. Can I bring back my Messages somehow?\n\nA: The messages themselves are stored in the database file, ~/Library/Messages/chat.db. After that file is definitely in place, try rebooting your computer. \nIn my case, once that file was in place it would only show 1 message from each of the conversations, but after rebooting, all of the messages showed up.\n", "Q: Change GarageBand recording directory When recording audio in GarageBand (open GarageBand, New Project, Voice, then start recording). I would like to record to an external SSD rather than the system disk as I get occasional crashes that seem to be heavy IO related (either to much IO, or perhaps the disk is hitting a thermal shutdown point, I'm not sure). A simple solution seems to be to record the audio to an external SSD and bypass the internal spinning disk. Is there some hidden setting I can change to set the directory/location where GarageBand records audio to by default?\nThis is on Mac OS X 10.12.1, GarageBand 10.1.4.\n\nA: I don't know a lot about GarageBand - but I move most of ~/Library directories (where most of the User stuff is being kept) by simply linking them to a different place with:\nln -s /your/source/directory /your/target/directory in terminal.\nfor example, assuming that GarageBand is saving music to ~/Library/GarageBand/Music please move the directory first with \nmv ~/Library/Music/GarageBand ~/Library/Music/GarageBand.bak/ \nand then try to link a directory in the place of ~/Library/Music/GarageBand (the ~ resolves to your /Users/username or $HOME and is simply a shortcut to your home directory)\nln -s /Volumes/YourDevice/YourDirectory/GarageBandMusic ~/Library/GarageBand/Music\nassuming it is the place where your data is being stored. You could try to create a hard-link without the -s flag, but this is not possible for cross-device targets (i.e another hard-drive)\nI'm sure you can do this, there are more ways to force macOS to use linked directories.\nI don't know about GarageBand - but I keep my Mails, iTunes, Photos, Dropbox etc. on a different drive simply by either using symbolic links or, if necessary by hard-linking them to another directory.\nFor hard links workaround in macOS use https://github.com/selkhateeb/hardlink it does work very well.\nKeep in mind that if you rm -rf a symbolic link directory you delete link only.\nWhen you do the same with hard-link on the filesystem then rm -rf follows your link and deletes the things linked to it!\nLet me know if this helps you.\n", "Q: Obtain bad URL from Safari's current tab with Applescript The web site my.yahoo.com has an irritating bug (I'm surprised it works at all) where clicking on one of its links sometimes produces a URL such as the following: \nhttp://sports.yahoo.comhttps//sports.yahoo.com/news/rested-kings-ready-host-not-rested-hurricanes-082033171--nhl.html\n\nIn the example, you can see that \"http://sports.yahoo.com\" is repeated twice. I wanted to find the easiest way to correct these URLs while surfing. Sadly, I cannot even perform the first necessary action, which is to pull the URL from the title bar of the current tab. You would think sending the following command to Safari in an Applescript would work:\nset thisTabUrl to the URL of the current tab in window 1\n\nSadly, apparently, if the URL is invalid, I get:\nfile:///Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/\n\nIs there some other way I can coax Safari to give me the contents of the URL area of the current tab to then process in the Applescript, which will then attempt to set the current tab's URL to the correct url and open that page? I'm pretty sure I have the rest of the necessary code, to open the correct URL in that same tab.\nFor extra credit, what might be the most effortless way to launch this script when encountering such a bad URL while surfing in Safari?\n\nA: I've tried numerous times to reproduce the issue, however I couldn't. So this solution was tested by manually entering a standard URL twice, via copy and paste, and going from there. I also used the bad URL you've shown in your question. \nIn Safari, this essentially tries to build a valid URL from of the double URL using AppleScript run as an Automator Service when pressing ⌘B and sets the current document (window, tab) to the proper URL.\nCreate an Automator Service with the settings as shown in the image below and save it as: Fix Bad URL\nThen in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, scroll down to General, select Fix Bad URL, click Add Shortcut and type: ⌘B\n\n\nAppleScript code for the Automator Service:\non badURL()\n    try\n        --    # Put the bad URL on the Clipboard.\n        tell application \"Safari\"\n            activate\n            delay 0.5\n            tell application \"System Events\"\n                key code 37 using {command down} # ⌘L\n                delay 0.5\n                key code 8 using {command down} # ⌘C\n                delay 0.5\n            end tell\n        end tell\n        --    # Retrieve the bad URL from the Clipboard.\n        set theBadURL to get (the clipboard)\n        --    # Trim the first eight characters off of 'theBadURL'.\n        --    # This is done because the bad URL can have an occurrence of both 'http' and 'https' in the string in either\n        --    # order and by trimming off, it lessens the amount of logic necessary to build a good URL from the bad URL.\n        --    # The good URL, after all, is going to be built from what's after the second occurrence of either one. \n        --    # Test first for 'https' then 'http', as that makes more sense logically to do so.            \n        set theBadURL to do shell script \"awk 'BEGIN { print substr(\\\"\" & theBadURL & \"\\\", 9) }'\"\n        --    # Build the good URL from the bad URL.\n        set theGoodURL to do shell script \"awk -F 'https.*//' '{print $2}'<<<\" & quoted form of theBadURL\n        if theGoodURL is not equal to \"\" then\n            set theGoodURL to \"https://\" & theGoodURL\n        else\n            set theGoodURL to do shell script \"awk -F 'http.*//' '{print $2}'<<<\" & quoted form of theBadURL\n            if theGoodURL is not equal to \"\" then\n                set theGoodURL to \"http://\" & theGoodURL\n            end if\n        end if\n        return theGoodURL\n    on error eStr number eNum\n        display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon caution\n        return\n    end try\nend badURL\n\non run\n    try\n        tell application \"Safari\"\n            activate\n            set thisTabsURL to (get URL of current tab of window 1)\n            --    # Check for bad URL and if found, build a good URL from it.\n            tell current application\n                if thisTabsURL contains \"file:\" then\n                    set theGoodURL to my badURL()\n                    tell application \"Safari\" to set the URL of the front document to theGoodURL\n                end if\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    on error eStr number eNum\n        display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon caution\n        return\n    end try\nend run\n\n\nNote that while I tested this under OS X 10.8.5 and macOS 10.12 and it did work under my test conditions, nonetheless it may not work properly every time under every condition and hence why the try and on error statements are being used in the code. Hopefully this will trap any error(s) with appropriate output to then enhance the code to handle any error(s) that didn't occur during my testing.\n", "Q: How do you enable the app-context-dependent touch bar for Photoshop on the new 2016 rmbp How do you enable the app-context-dependent touch bar for Photoshop on the new 2016 rmbp?\nI've just updated to the latest CC software 2017.0 releases - and not seeing the custom touch bar.

Additionally, I have check the system preference's sound section, and checked the output, mute check, and made sure the headphones were chosen as the output. However still emits low sound. Is the jack damaged in some way and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I'm assuming that you've had no issues when using your computer's speakers to produce output so you could download an EQ like Boom 2 or eqMac to bump up the volume via software. Just be careful using your speakers afterwards if you have to turn it up really high.\nAnother solution which I think is a bit safer but can be a bit of a hassle depending on your personal preference would be to buy an external sound card. Depending on what you get you may gain functionality and if it doesn't work you can return the item and you can be pretty sure it's a software issue.\nI also would like to make sure that you're not using high impedence headphones that need an amp because if you are then that would explain your issue but I'm assuming you're not.\n\nA: Make sure the cord is plugged all the way in and that there isn't anything in the audio jack. I've had this issue happen several times before where some lint or dust buildup wasn't letting the headphones plug all the way in.\n", "Q: Use old iPhone to send iMessages I want to use my old iPhone for iMessage but I am running into an issue setting up iMessage as it seems to be waiting for phone activation which wont happen because I have a new android phone.  \nHow can I set up my iPhone to only send iMessages from my Apple ID?  Right now my old number is grayed out with a loading wheel to the left.\n\nA: Assuming you still have a current Apple ID, you would set up your old iPhone to send/receive messages on your Apple ID email address, rather than your mobile number.\n\n\n*\n\n*First you need to ensure you're logged into iCloud on your old iPhone.\nGo to Settings > iCloud to do this.\n\n*Second you need to set what 'addresses' you want to have your iPhone send/receive iMessages with. Go to Settings > Messages and tap on the Send & Receive option. You will see two sets of addresses, one you can be reached at and one you start conversations from. You will need to ensure that the Apple ID you use for iCloud is added and ticked.\n\n\nNOTE: Your old iPhone can only send/receive iMessages while connected to the internet. Also, it will only work with the email address (people won't be able to send an iMessage to your mobile number as it's now on an Android device).\nShould you run into any problems, post back using the comments function below.\n\nA: Unfortunately if your old cell phone doesn’t have cell service (SMS specifically), iMessage cannot be activated. Quoting Apple:\n\nIf you’re using an iPhone, you need SMS messaging to activate your phone number with iMessage and FaceTime.\n\nFrom “If you get an error when trying to activate iMessage or FaceTime.” In my own test this proved to be true, and I couldn’t find any way around this iPhone-specific restriction.\n", "Q: How to send a password to iBook buyers?

After doing that successfully, I deleted the macOS Sierra Installer app from Applications directory. But my Drive size was not freed by 4.88GBs instead deleting it freed only 1GB. Are there any residual files I need to remove manually?\n\nA: The problem is with a disk image with the name Apple RID... created by the macOS Sierra installer which did not get ejected when macOS installer was deleted and was occupying around 5.5GBs and wasn't visible anywhere except in Disk Utility.\nAfter ejecting that disk using Disk Utility and restarting the laptop, the memory which was held up got freed. \n", "Q: How do I go about replacing the LCD on my 2014 macbook air?

(Canadian postal codes are uppercase.)\nHow can one place an order for print products when this error message appears?\n\nA: NOTE: iPhoto can no longer submit orders for print products. The solution below only works with the Mac OS X/macOS app Photos.\nAs posted in these threads, there seems to be an occasional issue with address validation that fails when the letter O follows the letter P (regardless of whether there are other characters between them).\nFor instance, the address\n\n123 Park Avenue, Montreal, QC, W9W 9W9\n\nwould be ok, but\n\n123 Parkour Avenue, Montreal, QC, W9W 9W9\n\nwould fail.\nIn my case, since both the city and province contained the letter O, I removed the letter O from the street address, I removed the whole city name and replaced it with a single letter, and then changed the province to one without the letter O. My address went from something like this\n\n123 Parkour Avenue, Waterloo, ON, W9W 9W9\n\nto\n\n123 Parkur Avenue, W, BC, W9W 9W9\n\nThat let the process continue and (after pressing Ignore on the suggested address dialog), I was taken to the final Place Order dialog.* On the phone with Apple, they also mentioned the possibility of changing the address even at that final step with the down arrow indicated in the image:\n\nPhotos froze sometimes, especially at the suggested address dialog (the one where you press Ignore), so this may take a couple of tries.\n*There's a chance that you might be able to successfully place the order here, avoiding the final address change. Your postal code, combined with the (hopefully similar-enough-to-the-real-one) street address should be enough for the postal service to figure out the phony city and province. However, since print products aren't cheap, you may not want to take that risk.\n", "Q: How can I stop iTunes uploading my tracks from my iPhone 6s to iCloud? The answers already posted to questions similar to mine don't seem to apply to my phone. I can keep individual tracks on the phone by pressing the download button, but with nearly 2000 songs on the phone, this seems like a long task, with no guarantee that the song won't simply upload again. Is there a way (as for photos) of preventing it?\nUsing the Cloud is difficult where 3G/4G reception is poor, underground in London, and it uses up my data allowance very quickly indeed.... However, I do need email and calendar to be up to date, so I don't want to turn off the Cloud entirely.\n\nA: From my reading of your question, there's actually three separate things you're trying to achieve and/or concerned about.\nEmail and Calendar\nKeeping your email and calendar synced is an iCloud setting. To ensure these are up to date, go to Settings > iCloud and ensure that both Mail and Calendar are toggled on. \nMusic\nIf your music is uploading to the cloud then you must have iCloud Music Library enabled, so you would need to disable this. To do this, go to Settings > Music and ensure that iCloud Music Library is off.\nNOTE: You should be aware that this will mean you won't be able to access songs, albums and playlists from Apple Music. However, if the only reason you're wanting to stop this is out of concern for your data allowance and patchy 3G/4G reception, then refer to Mobile Data below.\nMobile Data\nYou can actually leave your iCloud Music Library enabled, but restrict all syncing to WiFi networks instead. You can do this by going to Settings > Music > Mobile Data and selecting what options you want enabled/disabled. \n", "Q: Stolen iPhone and can't see on find my iPhone Someone stole my iPhone yesterday and Find my iPhone was on. We were tracking the place and then they might have turned the phone off because it appeared offline. Today I couldn't find my device on Find my iPhone. I was using two phones with the same Apple ID, and I can only see one phone now.  \nWhat does this mean? Did they just erase my phone and set up as a new phone? I blocked IMEI number and it was passcode protected as well.\n\nA: If the phone disappeared from Find my iPhone on iCloud (which is different from being offline), someone must have removed it.\nEven if the thief turned it off and reset it, it would remain on iCloud as an offline device until the account owner removes it.\nOn a side note, if the IMEI lock disables data on the SIM, it makes it difficult if not impossible to find the phone unless the thief goes to a place where the phone has connected to a wifi network before.\n", "Q: Will there be consequences or issues if I install XQuartz? I need to install XQuartz to install Inkscape, a vector graphics application.\nMay I know if issues would come when I install XQuartz? I'm new to OS X and I find the need to install an application to install another application unusual. \n\nA: It's absolutely fine, it's essentially a standalone application that you can uninstall again anytime. Except when you're running Inkscape, you'll never know it's there.\nIn fact, XQuartz used to come on the OS X install DVD (though it wasn't installed by default), but like Java and Flash, Apple just prefer not to package and ship those things with the OS any more, and require you to install it separately direct from the developer.\nIf you're still not sure, there is a native port of Inkscape in progress that doesn't require XQuartz, but it was a little buggy last time I tried.\n", "Q: When does an automatic app update happen on iOS? Sometimes I have a very large backlog of app updates (20+) and other times I do not. Sometimes app updates happen when I'm not using my phone. Sometimes apps start updating immediately after I unlock.\nWhat are the exact, technical criteria that govern when an automatic app update happens?\nI think there might even be some sort of concurrency limit, like three at a time.\n\nA: When the device checks for updates, it builds a list of all apps that need updating. All of those updates will be installed assuming these criteria are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iOS device must be on and/or asleep.\n\n*The iOS device must be connected to power and/or battery is almost full. \n\n*The iOS device must be connected to a cellular data network and/or Wi-Fi.\n\n*Updates larger than 100MB will only be downloaded over Wi-Fi, never cellular.

Is it likely that I'm gonna have to reinstall the OS?\n\nA: Yes. Single user mode is the most basic thing your OS can do. If that fails, you either have a major hardware problem or the OS needs to be reinstalled. \nMost people make a backup and then attempt a reinstall. If you can't reinstall the OS, that pins the problem on the hardware pretty squarely. If it works, you can safely assume the software just needed to be reinstalled. \n", "Q: Should I be charging or discharging my smartphone when I'm using it at my desk? When I'm at my desk and using my smartphone, it is better to keep it charged or discharged? \nIf I use it while it's discharging I will use up my charge cycles? \nObviously this would be subjective to the smartphone model I'm using, but generally speaking from a li-io battery point of view?\nDoes the iPhone offer a better charging/battery lifespan efficiency?\n\nA: This questions risks inviting a lot of opinion, so some may vote to close this down. \nHowever, to try and keep this to the facts, I refer you firstly to what Apple has to say about their batteries. You should also read this.\nIn a nutshell, the key indisputable points are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple lithium-ion batteries use fast charging to reach 80% of their capacity and then switch to slower trickle charging to complete the charge.\n\n*Charge your iPhone whenever you want. Many people believe you need to let them discharge 100% before recharging. This is not true.\n\n*Ambient temperature is one of the biggest factors in battery health/life. iPhones are designed to work at their best when ambient temperatures are between 0° to 35° C (32° to 95° F).\n\n*Store your iPhone where the temperature is between -20º and 45º C (-4º to 113º F). Don’t leave it in your car, because temperatures in parked cars can exceed 45º C (113º F).\n\n\nAlso, the latest research confirms one of the most important determinants of what ruins a battery is time. (You could purchase a brand new iPhone battery and leave it unused in its original packaging for five years and then find it's capacity is nowhere near what it should be when you start using it) \n", "Q: How to set keep touch on Mac touchpad? I am rookie in Mac and I came from Ubuntu\nOn my previous Dell laptop if I needed to mark some part of text in order to copy or delete it I just made one short touch on touchpad and immediately second touch (not click) and second touch I keep my finger on touchpad and than I can just move mouse and mark text.\nor for example how I deleted files:\nI have a file on desktop I need to trash it. I put mouse on the file make one short touch and immediately second touch and keep touch on file and now I am able to move file to trash on somewhere on the desktop.\nBut with mac touchpad I need make click (not just touch) and keep click with one finger and another finger I can move the file somewhere I need. Just remember how you move you file on the desktop, you use two fingers for this.\nI hope I describe my problem clearly but feel free to ask\nQuestion is : if there is some settings how to change behavior of touch click?\n\nA: It is a bit hidden, but it is possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Click on Accessibility\n\n*Scroll down a bit and click on Mouse & Trackpad\n\n*Click on Trackpad Options…\n\n*Enable dragging\n\n*Select \"three finger drag\"\n\n", "Q: External drive not detected on MBP until it's connected to a Windows machine first I have a WD \"MY Passport\" 1 TB drive which I use for my TimeMachine backup on a 15\" MacBook Pro (Mid 2014).\nSometimes, the mac will not detect when the drive is being connected (it's not showing in the disk utility either). Rebooting the mac does not help.\nHowever, after some experimentations, I found out that if I connect the drive to a Windows machine, disconnect it and then connect it to the mac, it's detected and can be used with no issues (until the next time it's not detected).\nThis happened to me on another drive (a seagate drive) as well.\nAnyone has any idea what's going on here?\n\nA: You do not have the \"standard\" formatting on the WD:\nfor TimeMachine it should be imperatively  GUID Partition Table.   and.  Mac OS X Extended (journaled).\nIf it really has that, open DiskUtility and select the WD, then select the FirstAid tab: it will check and repair permissions.\n", "Q: How can I eject a Time Machine drive quickly? I have a Time Machine drive for my laptop...\n\nI bring the machine to work. Every morning I right-click \"Eject\" the drive, and it takes forever or just doesn't eject.\nI'm in a hurry, so I either sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now or if I'm really in a rush just yank the drive (then get scolded by the OS when I log back in later).\nWhat would be a better way?\n\nMacBook Pro mid 2012 ; OS 10.12.1 (Sierra)\n\nA: There is a 3rd party app named Mountain that gives you control over all your connected volumes. It's not free, selling for $7 but they have a free trial period so you can test drive it. Mountain creates a menu item that user can use to mount, unmount, eject or load volumes. I can't guarantee it is faster than your method but I use it to mount or unmount stubborn drives. \n\nA: Maybe too much data to backup. reduce your time machine backup to an interval smaller than 4 hours, if the unmount is slow it is because the backup has too much to backup, or that your antivirus slows it a lot. therefore, if there is less to backup before ejection the unmounting should be quicker. Do not also forget to check monthly if your disk transfert rate become too slow, (copy a big file and count the time) . very long disk access are a sign for a forthcoming disk failure...\n\nA: This is a clear problem with backups for laptops. You want portability, and don't want to wait hours for a backup to finish. \nFirstly, killing the backup processes while running may result in corrupted backup files: yanking the drive out may damage the mechanical drive itself causing loss of the whole volume.\nHow much data are you creating each day? Once the first backup on your entire storage is created, then it should only be adding the delta (changed files) every hour.\nThis is at home, before you leave for work? Your best bet is backing up to a network storage device on your wireless network. Sadly, Apple just killed off its Time Capsule products, but any NAS box should work. You could even plug in that drive to your router, if it has USB slots, though you'll need to reformat it to NTFS. \nAnother alternative is to use Cloud Storage as a backup strategy.\n\nA: There is a small and Free app that lets you have more control of Time machine activity.\nThis does not let you brut force the Eject but will turn off the process in time for you. Just set it so to stop before you wake up.\nie.. Do not back up from 6AM to 11PM\nTimeMachineEditor is a software for macOS that lets you change the default one-hour backup interval of Time Machine. You can change the interval or create a more sophisticated scheduling (see screenshots below).\n\n", "Q: Does FDE encrypt all partitions? I have two partitions, one for boot.\nNow I've enabled full disk encryption, looks like the one for boot is encrypted. But what about the other one? I'm not sure if it's also encrypted.\nHow can I verify that?\n\nA: You say you \"enabled full disk encryption\" -- what exactly do you mean by that? If you mean FileVault, it's not truly full disk encryption (as ecnepsnai said), it's full volume encryption for the startup volume, and your second partition is not encrypted. If you did something other than turning on FileVault, it'll depend on what you used.\nIf you used FileVault, it is possible to separately encrypt your secondary volume in Finder by right-clicking on it, and choosing \"Encrypt\" from the shortcut menu. This is based on the same \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\" volume format that FileVault uses, but rather than automatically using your login password to unlock the volume it'll need a plain password just for the volume.\nYou can record this volume password in your keychain so it'll be able to unlock and mount the second volume after you log in, or optionally use Keychain Access to move the volume password from your login keychain (available only after you log in) to the System keychain (accessible anytime OS X is running) so it can mount the volume even before you've logged in.\nAnd a technical note: even with both volumes encrypted, you still don't quite have full disk encryption. There's an invisible partition named Recovery HD that holds (among other things) the booter file that asks for your account password at startup, and uses that to get access to the main volume. That must be available before the \"disk\" is unlocked, and therefore cannot be encrypted. There's also a (also hidden) EFI partition used for firmware updates, which also aren't encrypted.\n\nA: In general, no. FileVault will encrypt the largest / boot partition and not the entire disk. To inspect your specific installation, open the terminal app and type:\ndiskutil list\n\nAnything that's Apple_CoreStorage might be encrypted, but might not. Anything not listed as Apple_coreStorage is not encrypted. EFI is usually 300MB of unencrypted space and the Recovery HD is usually 650 MB of unencrypted space. By default - all the user data you care about is encrypted and on a 250 GB drive - you have 0.3% of the storage not encrypted and 99.7% encrypted.\nAs to the might / might not part - use this command:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nLook for High Level Queries in the middle of that output (and you might have to scroll back to see that output in a small terminal window). You want to see \"Fully Secure\" and a conversion status of Complete.\n", "Q: Run a standard unix process (not an app) on iPhone from OS X command line I'm working on improving iOS cross-compilation support for ghc, which has a metaprogramming feature which requires running code at compile time. One mechanism for this involves running a process on the target and communicating with it from the compiler via pipes. This is a standard unix process (one compiled for iOS), not an iPhone app. How can I launch this process on a connected iPhone from the OS X box where the compiler is running? For the simulator I can use simctl spawn but I don't know of anything similar for real devices.\n\nA: You can't.\nJailed iOS devices have no method of executing any given program remotely. You'd have to jailbreak your device to be given access to terminal.\nThe iOS simulator is slightly different since it lacks many of the security features that the full iOS has, and since its running directly on your mac as child processes (rather than an emulator emulating a ARM processor).\n", "Q: Is there a convenient way for me to use my other macs audio output? I have two macs, one of them is plugged into speakers. Can I use the mac that isn't plugged in to use my other mac for audio output in some convenient fashion?\n\nA: Sure. Since you can AirPlay system audio there are tons of solutions for this nowadays, any program that can act as an AirPlay receiver.\nMany of these are commercial (like AirFoil and AirServer), not exactly made for your use case (media centers like Kodi) or  terminaly/somewhat fiddly (shairport-sync).\nThere should definitely be streamlined enough freeware/open source implementations out there that aren't outdated and abandoned, but I don't know of any. There's a list on the open-airplay github that might be worth a look.\nLast time I needed to do this I used the old school method of soundflower plus a client+server to pass audio - Soundfly is free and still works fine. Can act up occasionally but more robust/set it and forget it than AirPlay in my experience.\n", "Q: Regarding email attachments from gmail app on iphone I have iphone 5S. I want to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to save a doc or pdf attachment from gmail app locally on an iphone?\n\n*How to view this attachment (from step 1) on iphone?\n\n*How to send this attachment to someone else using gmail app from iphone?\nThe attachment icon only gives the option for photos and google drive link.\n\n\nI have earlier used gmail app on Android phone and there it was very simple to download or send an attachment but iphone seems to be tricky. Am I missing something here?\n\nA: For PDF files, you can import into iBooks and simply access it from iBooks. From there you can also send the PDF as an attachment for someone else by clicking on share.\nFor other files, I think your best bet would be using the Google Drive app or iCloud in order to keep on viewing it on your phone. Another thing you can do is save the files in the notes app and then you can also view it and send it out from there.\nFor the 5S, I'm sure that you can use iBooks for PDF but I'm not 100% sure on if you can put other file types into notes (although I don't see why not).\n", "Q: Does a Diagnostics & Usage entry imply an app was installed? If an app has an entry in Diagnostics & Usage on a particular day, does that imply that it was installed on that day?\n\nA: The entries you're seeing in Diagnostics and Usage are crash logs for applications on your device.\nIf a crash log exists for an app, then yes it means it was installed on your device at the time of the crash.\n", "Q: Scrivener app crashing on macOS Sierra because of growl.framework I recently upgraded to macOS Sierra and moved over my El Capitan stuff over via a Time Machine backup.

I remember the controversy around the 27\" Apple Thunderbolt display: it doesn't work with a PC. Despite the fact that Thunderbolt encapsulates DisplayPort, you cannot use it with a DisplayPort connection - which is even more confusing considering Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use Mini-DisplayPort physical connectors.\nThe new LG Ultrafine 5K display looks very attractive - at least as far as the published specs are concerned (I'm not a fan of the 'chin' on the top of the monitor). I see that it only connects using USB-C connectors and according to Apple's published information: it uses Thunderbolt 3 over USB-C to deliver a 5K video stream by using both DP1.2 channels at once.\n...but does this work with a PC? And if so, to what extent?\nMy current workstation has a Broadwell-E X99 motherboard which has an ASUS Thunderbolt 3 add-in card which \"works\" by having me connect a DisplayPort cable from my GPU's output back into the Thunderbolt card, which then combines it with the PCI-Express channels. My GPU is an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 which supports DisplayPort 1.4 - I note that only DisplayPort 1.3 is necessary for uncompressed 5K at 60Hz in 24-bit color mode - but Thunderbolt 3 only supports DisplayPort 1.2 - and I can't see any other Thunderbolt add-in cards that accept two DisplayPort inputs (for dual-channel DisplayPort)\n\n\n*\n\n*Can the LG Ultrafine 5K monitor be used with a PC - in any capacity?\n\n*Can the LG Ultrafine 5K monitor be used with a PC - in 5K 60Hz mode using a computer with DisplayPort 1.4 ports?\n\n*Is there also enough bandwidth to run it in 5K/60Hz mode with a Gigabit (or even 10GigE?) adapter also plugged into the monitor?\n\n*As an aside, does the monitor support multiple inputs? What if I attach another Thunderbolt 3 video source to another of the USB-C ports on the monitor?\n\n\nA: The compatibility of these monitors with a PC and/or Windows is unclear. Even the FAQs page has a couple of related questions, but these are yet to be answered.\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend buying this with the intention of using it with your setup unless you get a definitive answer from either Apple or LG.\nIn the meantime I refer you to this info:\n\nAt this point you may have noticed that all of these specs are the same as Apple's iMacs. LG Display makes the IPS displays in the iMacs, so it's very likely if not certain that these are the same panels. Given that these monitors are targeted at users of the new MacBook Pro, it's also very likely that they do not have any sort of sRGB fallback mode, as such an option is unnecessary on macOS where there is end to end color management in any AppKit app and even in most apps that don't use AppKit. This is important to keep in mind for anyone interested in buying these for a Windows computer. The state of color management on Windows means that in nearly every application you'll be stuck with oversaturated colors and no workaround, so I wouldn't recommend it even if it can work.\nWhile I'm on the topic of Windows support, I will say that from a\ntechnical perspective, the displays should work with a Windows\ncomputer. However, product listings for the monitor specify that you\nneed a Mac with USB-C for the 4K model, and a Mac with Thunderbolt 3\nfor the 5K model. This limits the 4K model to Apple's MacBook, and the\nnew MacBook Pros, with the 5K model only working on the latter. This\nalso ties back to the integration with macOS. Most monitors use\nphysical buttons for controlling brightness and volume, but the LG\nUltraFine displays use the integrated controls that macOS provides,\nmeaning that it can respond to the volume and brightness keys on Mac\nkeyboards. It doesn't look like the monitors have any buttons to fall\nback on, so this may be another situation where Windows users should\nbe wary, and it definitely explains why the monitors are being\nmarketed specifically for their integration with macOS.\n\nSource: http://www.anandtech.com/show/10798/lg-introduces-new-4k-and-5k-ultrafine-monitors\n", "Q: Firefox/Services menu void The items in Firefox/Services menu disappeared after I restart my iMac, but not in every browser tab.

As of today, whenever I use gpg2 (installed via Homebrew) on my Mac (10.12.1), I now see the following warning:\nWarning: using insecure memory!\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm seeing this same behavior on two different machines: a Mac mini (late 2012) and a MacBook Pro (late 2012), both running 10.12.1.\nAs the GnuPG FAQ says:\n\nGnuPG tries to lock memory so that no other process can see it and so that the memory will not be written to swap. If for some reason it’s not able to do this (for instance, certain platforms don’t support this kind of memory locking), GnuPG will warn you that it’s using insecure memory.\nWhile it’s almost always better to use secure memory, it’s not necessarily a bad thing to use insecure memory. If you own the machine and you’re confident it’s not harboring malware, then this warning can probably be ignored.\n\nThe thing that baffles me is that gpg2 has not changed since September 12, 2016. I've had version 2.0.30 installed more or less since then, but I've only started seeing this warning about insecure memory today. Even though the gpg2 formula hasn't changed since September 12, 2016, the one thing I can say for sure that I did on both machines prior to the onset of seeing this warning is a brew update && brew upgrade. But I'm not even sure how that could affect this; given what the GnuPG FAQ says, it seems like this has something more to do with the OS and memory locking.\n... And what is even more odd is that I also have gpg1 installed from Homebrew (version 1.4.21), which does not warn about insecure memory when I use it:\n$ gpg1 --require-secmem\ngpg: Go ahead and type your message ...\n^C\ngpg: Interrupt caught ... exiting\n\n$ gpg2 --require-secmem\nWarning: using insecure memory!\ngpg: will not run with insecure memory due to --require-secmem\n\nBoth binaries belong to the same owner and group and have the same permissions:\n-r-xr-xr-x  1 adamliter  admin  681932 Dec 10 18:06 /usr/local/Cellar/gnupg2/2.0.30_2/bin/gpg2\n-r-xr-xr-x  1 adamliter  admin  929352 Aug 17 09:21 /usr/local/Cellar/gnupg/1.4.21/bin/gpg1\n\nI just tried reinstalling gpg2 with Homebrew: both by using the precompiled binary and by building form source, but this doesn't change anything. I still get the warning about using insecure memory.\nMoreover, even making the gpg2 binary have the setuid root bit flipped (as suggested, e.g., here) does not cause the message to disappear; it still warns about using insecure memory.\nDoes anyone know what could have changed such that I would suddenly start seeing this warning today? And why would I be seeing it when using the gpg2 binary but not the gpg1 binary?\nOther possibly relevant information:\n$ which gpg1\n/usr/local/bin/gpg1\n$ ls -al /usr/local/bin/gpg1\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 adamliter  admin  31 Aug 17 17:42 /usr/local/bin/gpg1 -> ../Cellar/gnupg/1.4.21/bin/gpg1\n$ which gpg2\n/usr/local/bin/gpg2\n$ ls -al /usr/local/bin/gpg2\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 adamliter  admin  34 Dec 10 18:06 /usr/local/bin/gpg2 -> ../Cellar/gnupg2/2.0.30_2/bin/gpg2\n\n\nUpdate\nI think the reason this is happening is because of the new version of libgcrypt. I still don't know why it's happening, but I'm pretty sure that this is at least the root cause of the issue. The formula for libgcrypt was just updated today for the 1.7.4 bump; this would explain why I'm seeing this on two different computers after a brew update && brew upgrade. It would also explain why it's not happening with gpg1, because gpg1 did not rely on the external libgcrypt cryptographic library, instead using its own integrated cryptographic library.\nMoreover, I also have gpg2 installed from MacGPG Suite, which is not exhibiting this problem and is linked against a different version of libgcrypt:\n$ /usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/gpg2 --version\ngpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.30\nlibgcrypt 1.6.6\nCopyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n$ gpg2 --version\ngpg (GnuPG) 2.0.30\nlibgcrypt 1.7.4\nCopyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n\nThus I'm guessing that this is probably a bug report for the maintainers of libgcrypt. I will post to their mailing list, but I will leave this here for the time being in case anyone else comes across the same issue and/or in case anyone else knows why exactly this is happening. If I get confirmation after sending word to their mailing list that this is a bug, I'll vote to close this question.\n\n\nA: The difference between gpg1 and gpg2 that I was noticing arises from the fact that gpg2 uses an external cryptographic library, libgcrypt, whereas gpg1 uses an integrated cryptographic library.\nAnd specifically, Homebrew updated to version 1.7.4 of libgcrypt on December 10, which introduced a regression in the libgcrypt code, leading to the insecure memory warning.\nThere was initially a bit of discussion about this on the pull request that introduced the formula for libgcrypt 1.7.4 into Homebrew, suggesting that it might be by design:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dominyk Tiller found something to suggest that it might not be a bug; and\n\n*@ilovezfs also found something to suggest that it might not be a bug either.\n\n\nNonetheless, it turns out that this was indeed a bug. The specific bug report was filed here:\n\n\n*\n\n*libgcrypt 1.7.4 breaks KWallet5: \"Can't get secure memory\" from GCRYCTL_INIT_SECMEM\nThe bug was fixed in this commit, and the fix was released in libgcrypt 1.7.5, which, at the time of writing, is now the version that Homebrew installs thanks to Dominyk Tiller. Thus, to fix this problem, you can just do a brew update && brew upgrade.\n\nFor posterity's sake, here is some information from an old version of this answer before it was confirmed that this was a bug in libgcrypt:\nOne thing you can do if you'd rather not always see the warning about insecure memory is to add no-secmem-warning to ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf. An old version of the GnuPG FAQ points out:\n\nLocking pages against being swapped out is not necessary if your system uses an encrypted swap partition.  In fact that is the best way to protect sensitive data from ending up on a disk.  If your system allows for encrypted swap partitions, please make use of that feature.  Note that GPG does not know about encrypted swap partitions and might print the warning; thus you should disabled the warning if your swap partition is encrypted.  You may also want to disable this warning if you can't or don't want to install GnuPG setuid(root).  To disable the warning you put a line\nno-secmem-warning\ninto your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file.\n\nAs far as I know, macOS does use encrypted swap space. For me, for example, sysctl vm.swapusage returns:\nvm.swapusage: total = 1024.00M  used = 234.75M  free = 789.25M  (encrypted)\n\nFurthermore, as @sideshowbarker points out in the comments, there is also a post to the gnupg-users mailing list, which says it's relatively safe to ignore this warning:\n\n[...] it's <understatement> pretty hard </understatement> to exploit\n  insecure memory without root privileges -- and if your attacker has root\n  privileges on your machine then it's all over anyway.\n\n", "Q: Hindi not supported? - iTunes Connect (App Store) Trying to create a new app and while Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Arabic and Korean was created without any issue, Hindi gives an error:\n\nApp Name must not contain the following characters: जी वं त ...\n\nAny idea?

She also lives 8000 miles and several time zones away. So I want to help set up her computer as solidly as possible without needed much long distance sketch support. \nI'm updating her Mac to macOS Sierra. I cleaned off mackeeper. I have her use Google Chrome for anything Flash related (yeah I know, but she watches videos and the ones she likes need Flash).

Thanks. \n\nA: Some things I would look into in such a scenario:\nBackup\nAbsolutely essential, and something you can set up easily. At least attach an external drive and configure TimeMachine. If you want to add more protection against handling errors or such, use a service like Backblaze or Arq to get an off-site backup.\nRemote Access\nSooner or later you will do support over phone and it is much faster and easier to do if you can see what is happening on the screen. I usually use Teamviewer which is easy to setup and use. Just make sure that everything is working as it should before you leave house.\nRestricting things on the computer itself\nWith remote access in place you can get rather restrictive with what the user can do. You probably don't want to give them administrator rights (so make sure you set up a non-admin account for them) which eliminates most handling risks. I would also restrict application installation to the App Store.\n\nA: *\n\n*Get them AppleCare so they can get professional support from people that know how to support and configure and maintain macOS. \n\n*Help them understand their backup choice. \n\n*Help them verify the backup is working 2 and 5 weeks after you guide them in setting it up. \n\n*Educate them about gatekeeper and how to avoid falling for scare tactics. \n\n\nLocking down things is a losing battle.

Coming from Windows background, I'm usually very paranoid about the files I download, but one time I did something stupid - I downloaded some video files that were hosted in https://openload.co/ (not a malicious website, but it does store files that can have just about anything on them).\nI realized that this might not have been a good idea a few days later, and I deleted the files from my Mac. One potential issue is that I backed up my Mac to an external hard drive as well (so that drive got the files too), but I also deleted the questionable video files from there.\nMy questions: could Mac malware hide itself inside a .mp4 file? Even if I open the file, wouldn't there be some window asking about installing a malicious program or could one just install & run without requiring an administrator's password? And finally, if it was malware, could it have gotten past macOS's sandboxing and infected my other files, and potentially my entire backup disk as well? \nA couple of details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Video is basic .mp4 file\n\n*When opened in a video player, it plays as expected\n\n*I have both VLC and QuickTime installed on my Mac\n\n\nA: Exploits through any other type of file than a .dmg disk file are rare on macOS. To harm a Mac with any other file type than an application, said file (be it .mp4, .mp3, .pdf, .png, .jpg, etc.) would have to exploit a vulnerability in the operating system or media player. If you are using a standard video player (like the latest version of QuickTime) you'll be almost immune to any malware-laced .mp4 files that probably don't exist anyway.\nNo hacker in their right mind would lace a video file with malware: it's just too hard to get it to work across multiple video players and operating systems, and it's so much easier to get malware on a user's machine using .dmg files. So I highly doubt a .mp4 file would contain malware that would affect your Mac, which would almost certainly be immune to it anyway with the latest operating system and media player. \nSo without even answering your follow-up questions yet, you are safe. If you want to feel even safer (and truly ensure that your Mac is unaffected), you can download an antivirus app like Avast or BitDefender as I explain in this answer.\nTo answer your follow-up questions: if this \"video\" file was really an application file, your Mac would notify you that it's an application from an unknown developer, force you to go to System Preferences to allow installations of unknown applications, and insist that you type in an administrator's password before allowing this application to run any code. \nSo even if this was an application file (.dmg) masquerading as an audio or video file, you'd still be safe. Read more about how you're still safe even if you downloaded a malicious application file (so long as you don't manually install it) in this answer.\ntl;dr: you're not going to get  malware from downloading a video or audio file.\n\nEdit 1: A notable exception to this \"a file can't harm your Mac unless it's an application\" rule is the Word .docx macro. Word documents (and documents for Excel and the rest of Open Office, thanks WGroleau) can try to convince you to run them as a macro, essentially turning them into mini-applications. These can be malware, so never run a downloaded Word document as a macro.  Read more about Word macro malware.\nEdit 2: Email attachments can look like .mp3 files or .jpg files, but actually be .dmg files disguised as such. Whereas when you download a file from the web you'll get a prompt that lets you know what file type you're about to download, you may have no such warning when opening an email attachment. Thus, don't open a suspicious email attachment even if it claims to be a .mp4/.mp3/.jpg/.png/.pdf format thinking it's necessarily safe.\nEdit 3: If you don't want to install an antivirus app, you can use the website virustotal.com to upload a file and have multiple antivirus engines scan it at once, in the cloud.\nWoah, so many edits here.\n\nA: Theoretically malware/virus can hide inside .mp4-files, image-files or any other type of file. They would rely on bugs in the player/viewer programs that triggers the execution of code inside the media file.\nWhether or not they can do so without the user noticing depends on which viewer/player program you're using. If you're using a program without any protection running as an administrative user - then yes, it could infect for example other applications without notifying the user. \nHowever SIP on modern macOS means that system files would under normal circumstance be safe from modication. Unless ofcourse an exploit in SIP is found.\nIf your viewer/player program is from the Mac App Store it is sandboxed meaning that it is limited in what it can access without requesting extra permissions from the user.\n2) There's nothing inherently in Macs that means that \"other files\" cannot be infected, no. But just the process of copying the file to the external drive should not make it possible for other files on the drive to be infected. This is only possible when a viewer/player program loads and parses the media file (and only when said viewer/player has an exploitable bug).\n3) It depends on how the malware is introduced to the system and what system settings are.\nAll in all, the above mentioned is mostly theoretical. The chance of your system being infected after playing one or two random MP4s is extremely slim. If you think you have paranoia, please seek professionel help with that.\n", "Q: Recovery Mode is not available for MacBook Pro I have a MacBook Pro mid 2009 with El Capitan running on it. \nI wanted to enter Recovery Mode and pressed cmd+R until the Apple logo appeared with a progress bar.

I just upgraded to iPhone 6se at a Sprint store yesterday.  They moved all my data from old phone to new at the store.  Now, when I plug my iPhone into iTunes (v12.5.3.17) on my macbook, it only presents me with options to \"set up new iphone\" or \"restore from backup.\"  All the backups are old.

I was browsing the internet when the app store opened by itself, though the back button was greyed out and no apps were showing on that screen. I was unable to click out of it for maybe 1-2 seconds. I wasn't quite sure what was going on until my email app opened by itself too with a composed long message about virus software as a message to send. I didnt get a chance to see the address to whom it was being sent, but have lots of important work contacts I do not want to send weird virus spam to. So I wasnt sure what to do, so i tried quickly closing all apps and shutting off the iPad. I looked through my email accounts on my computer and do not see that any email was actually sent.\nSo i suspect that my iPad has a virus which is pretty weird given that it is not jailbroken. A cursory search for non-jailbroken iOS viruses mostly brings up chinese viruses, but i cant find much being reported. \nThoughts on what to do from here? \n\nA: You do not have a virus.\nWebsites and ads can open the App Store and can compose new emails. However it is very bad behaviour of websites or ads to open the  App Store without users consent.\nWhat website did you visit?\n", "Q: Two Google Drive accounts I am trying to enable two Google Drive accounts (private and work) following these steps.

Anyone with similar experience? Any solution? Thanks!\n\nA: Two solutions:\n(A) This one (Being a few terminal commands you can run)\nOR\n(B) Buying this app called Insynchq for $25/yr (15 day trial avail.)\n", "Q: How to wipe certain files from Time Machine Backups history but keep recent copies of them in case of a full restore I like Time Machine simplicity but I'd like to make it a little more space efficient: since system updates, apps updates etc change GBs, I'd like to exclude these only from older backups, keeping the last 5 or so backups full, bootable backups. \nFor instance: Let's say I have 3 time machine backups:\n\n\n*\n\n*2016-12-08-225622\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications\n\n*Library\n\n*System\n\n*Users\n\n\n*2016-12-09-225622\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications\n\n*Library\n\n*System\n\n*Users\n\n\n*2016-12-10-225622\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications\n\n*Library\n\n*System\n\n*Users\n\n\n\nI want to be able to wipe Applications, Library, System... from the first two backups and be able to keep only their latest version, in this case 2016-12-10-225622. So it would look like this after the \"cleanup\":\n\n\n*\n\n*2016-12-08-225622\n\n\n*\n\n*Users\n\n\n*2016-12-09-225622\n\n\n*\n\n*Users\n\n\n*2016-12-10-225622\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications\n\n*Library\n\n*System\n\n*Users\n\n\n\nThis would be similar to excluding system files from time machine + using a boot clone, except you can get some bootable history if you want to (ie. keep the last 5 versions bootable). \nIt also works for other folders: what about keeping the Downloads folder history of the last month but not from the last year? This is a middle ground between excluding files and folders and keeping them. \n\nA: Time Machine doesn't create bootable backups in the first place, and apart from the initial one they're not \"full\" either.\nIndividual folders/files as not valid targets for tmutil delete anyways, so selectively deleting parts of snapshots like you want is not possible. But that doesn't matter much since system and app updates are infrequent enough and small enough I can guarantee they're absolutely dwarfed by your general day-to-day ~ throughput.\nIf you're tight on space and want to optimize what you need to do is get BackupLoupe and look for anything that frequently takes up a lot of space in your snapshots. Cache files are already excluded automatically but some apps do put stuff in ~/Library/Application Support that effectively is cache, without being marked as such. Usually gets flagged correctly eventually but I've kept some Spotify and Chrome databases excluded, for example.\n\nA: Time Machine is space exclusive, and will fill up the entire space before deleting the older backups. If you want to save space on the hard disk of the backup, put rather this space on a second partition. \nEG you have a 2 TB disk, split it in two partition of 1TB, and affect the first partition for Time Machine, and use the second for your personal storage, or vice versa.\n\nA: TimeMachine does cumulative backups. That means that when a file changes in time, only the changes are written plus the pointer to the older part.\nLet TM remove backups that are oldest and not changed(added) the longest period), this is automatically done when TM does not have enough space anymore.\n\nA: As an afterthought: when you need only a complete recent backup: why not start a new TM backup on another disk: history is gone but everything is complete from the new date.\n", "Q: can I change the iphone 5S text tone swoosh on sending to a more noticable sound can I change the text tone swoosh on sending to something louder/more noticable on my iphone 5S, if so how?

After 60 seconds, refresh the System Information window if it doesn't self-refresh.\n\n\n\nIf you see the device connected in System Information but no network interface, you can try adding the interface explicitly. If that doesn't work, you would contact the vendor to see if/when their drivers are included with Apple's OS or if you need third party drivers. Or you could return the adapter and get a Belkin or kanex adapter, both of which work out of the box with all models of MacBook and Pro with USB C.\nAlso, consider upgrading to 10.12 if you don't have a good reason to not get the latest and greatest drivers direct from Apple.\n", "Q: Can't find my Mac last location even if my Mac was online only for half an hour? My Mac was lost the other night. Someone probably wiped it clean, and reset nvram. \nIs it possible to see last locations on Find my Mac? \nBecause who ever found it, he must have been connected to Wifi for at least 15-20min so he can do what he has done. \nSo the question is: can I see more than one last location of my MacBook, when he was online, on Find my Mac?\n\nA: It depends how smart the 'finder' was.\nIf they were fully aware of how to deal with a stolen ermm... borrowed computer, & knew to take it well away from any potential location-capable resource, then it could have been wiped with no further data exchange & therefore no Find My Mac information.\nUnlike an iPhone/iPad. a computer is not a completely locked-down environment, unless the drive is encrypted with FileVault & a firmware password set - though you still need to have enabled Find My Mac.\n", "Q: With iCloud photo storage enabled, do the photos get saved locally on the device and uploaded to iCloud? My wife has an iPhone 6s and I am trying to understand the way in which the device uses local storage. Her photos are very important to her and as such, I want them to be backed up safely. So we pay for extra storage on her iCloud account and her photos go there. Are they also stored on the device? Also, can they be deleted to make more available space on the local device but remain on the iCloud?\nI am not very familiar with iOS devices.\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library is not a backup solution, it's a sync solution.  \nIt can be used as a backup but I don't recommend it.  There's other solutions, like Dropbox or BackBlaze, that can serve as an offsite backup (using the 3-2-1 backup strategy).  \nWhen you use iCloud for photos, all the photos will be synced to each device signed-in with that iCloud account.  Deleting a photo/video on any of those devices will also delete it from all the other devices when they re-sync.  See this Apple Support site for more info.\n\niCloud Photo Library uses your iCloud storage to keep all of your photos and videos up to date across your devices. You can make more space in iCloud when you delete photos and videos that you no longer need from the Photos app on any of your devices.\nYou can also choose to save space on your device when you turn on Optimize device Storage in Settings. With Optimize Storage on, Photos will automatically free up space when you need it by replacing original photos and videos with device-sized versions. All of your original, full-resolution photos and videos are safe in iCloud and you can download them at any time. Learn more about managing your photo and video storage.\n\n\nA: The only way to get a backup is to make a full-size sync to another device and do the backup on that device. Unless your wife has a 128GB iPhone and a relatively small Photos library (say under 20K), the iPhone is going to be set to optimized rather than full-size so there is no way to do a Photos backup with it. Typically, a full-size sync will be done with a Mac so you have lots of backup options at that point. I suspect it can be done with Windows as well but I've never tried it.\nA special case would be if your wife only shoots with her iPhone. In that case, the full-size copy of a photo is on the phone until some mysterious process decides that space is running low and swaps it out for an optimized version. If you used a second sync solution like Google Photos, it would capture the full-size version before it was potentially optimized. It's not a true backup since it becomes a separately managed photo archive and changes and deletions to Photos won't get synced into it but it's at least some protection against a catastrophic loss. You also have to be aware of the limits of the free version of Google Photos and if there are any gotchas with videos and Apple-specific formats like Live Photos.\n", "Q: Did I just brick my Apple TV's internet capability?

What's more, I do not play games on my MBP, though my kids play through my account on iOS devices so perhaps that is where the activity stems from.\nIs gamed meant to be hitting so many different IPs and ports?\n\n\nA: Yes it is. Why it does I couldn't tell you, but it does seem to do this as per this Apple forum. There are ways to disable it if you would like it to stop being so annoying.\nFrom that same Apple forum:\n\nIf you're monitoring network activity using Little Snitch, though, it's very annoying because it continually generates network traffic, whether you are using Game Center or not -- and it won't take no for an answer.\nYou can prevent gamed from running by logging in as an administrative user, running the Terminal application, and typing (or copying and pasting) at the prompt:\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed Disabled -bool true\nAfter restarting your computer, gamed will not be running and the Little Snitch network monitor won't be flashing.\nTo reverse the change, you can type:\nsudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed Disabled\n\nEdit: also note that because little snitch manages your computer's connectivity, not your network, the gamed process that is requesting those IP addresses is the one on your computer, NOT one from any iOS device.\n", "Q: Play music across multiple devices at once I'm pretty well invested into the Apple ecosystem.

The SIM card works fine in other smartphones, except for the time and date being out of order.\nDoes anyone have a solution for this?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: There are two possibilities.\n\n\n*\n\n*Broken SIM card. This would be more likely because SIM cards are small and break easily. However, you mentioned that the SIM card works ok in other phones. I would still suggest getting a replacement SIM card, as that will be easier than the other possibility.\n\n*Problematic phone. It is possible that the problem is with the phone itself. It could be a hardware problem, a firmware problem, or a software problem. The only way to tell would be to take the phone to an Apple Store (or, if that's not possible, an Apple Authorized Service Provider) to get it checked out.\n\nA: Most probably the SIM card is kind of broken. Contact the carrier to get a replacement.\n", "Q: Bootable USB without an OS shows as Windows in Startup Manager I was going to do a clean install of El Capitan and I created a Bootable USB drive. After making the drive I done the usual, I restarted while I held down the option key to white I was presented a screen with startup disk option screen and predictably I found my usual HDD that my OS is on, my backup drive, and my bootable USB which is called \"Windows\".\n\nThat's weird since I've never installed Boot Camp on this machine.\nWhen I boot from the \"Windows\" drive there's just a blank screen and the letter \"J\" flashing on it and nothing else happens. \n\nJust a \"J\" in the top left of the screen.\nWhat is this?\n\nA: Obviously something went wrong in making the bootable USB stick.\nIt should be 8GB.\nWhy not use a little tool that does it for you:\nDiskmaker_X,  see http://diskmakerx.com\nYou have to have the OSX installer on your disk: if you already installed it and it is gone, download it again from the Purchased tab of AppStore.\n\nA: Startup Manager detects any bootable media. Since you've designated the drive as bootable, it presumes there's something bootable installed there. You've likely created a bootable Windows drive, so that's what Startup Manager says, even if there's no actual Windows present.\n", "Q: How can I make Caps Lock work with Hebrew like it did prior to Sierra and without Ukulele? In Hebrew the Caps Lock is used to activate the vowel points. How do I restore this feature of Caps Lock in Hebrew, and without creating a new keyboard with a program that I do not know, like Ukulele?\n\nA: If you are talking about Apple's built-in Hebrew PC keyboard layout, you cannot make it work like before, but you should still be able to input vowels via Option plus Shift. Or you can download the new keyboard you need to restore the previous behavior. \n\nA: It is a regression and loss of functionality caused by Apple, plain and simple. It was not announced, much less given any justification, anywhere that I (or Google or Bing) can find.  It seems like a total goof by Apple.\nContrary to answer 1, you cannot type the same set of nikud using Option plus Shift as before with the Windows Hebrew keyboard, called \"Windows - PC\" on the Mac: you can type the Apple set of nikud, which is a proper subset of what you could type with Windows - PC. \nFor example, there is now no way to type Sin Dot and Shin Dot nikudes in the Apple set, whereas you could do so with the Windows - PC set.  \nAlso, the placement of the keys to type with Option+Shift to get a nikud is completely different now. For example, PATAH with Windows PC was Caps Lock+Shift+7, but now it's Option+Shift+6 -- i.e., a change from 7 to 6.  \nSo, you don't just have to change key typing from Caps Lock+Shift to Option+Shift, you basically have to learn the entire set of nikud key locations to combine with anew.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to wifi, OS 10.11.6, and failure to recognize when a hotspot network is joined I am recently unable to connect to my wifi AP from my mini which runs OS 10.11.6.

How can I use ps, or some variation thereof... to get a value that roughly corresponds to the \"Compressed Memory\" value Apple reports in Activity Monitor.app?\n\nusername 52036 100.1 24.1 8026832 3035512 ?? Rs ...com.apple.WebKit.WebContent\n\nOk, so it appears ps aux tells us...\n\n\n*\n\n*3035512, aka 2.83 Gb, which corresponds to \"Private Memory\"\n\n*8026832, aka 7.48 Gb which doesn't seem to correspond to anything. (Although it possibly could be (\"Memory\" 3.89 + \"Private Memory\" 2.84 +  \"Compressed Memory\" 1.05)?\n\n\nIs there any way \"normal\" way to access this metric, or is it just some \"magic\" value Apple has come up with?\n\nA: There's nothing magic about compressed memory. It's something that was added to 10.9 as one last step before the system swaps RAM out to storage. According to John Siracusa, this serves three major functions:\n\nMemory compression is a triple play for Mavericks. It’s a performance win; compressing and decompressing data in RAM is much faster than reading from and writing to disk, even an SSD. It’s an energy win; the less time spent moving data between RAM and disk, the more time the system can spend in its idle state. And finally, it’s a capability win; Mavericks can handle much more demanding workloads than previous versions of OS X before crying uncle.\n\nAs to getting at the details from the command line - that may be elusive. The overall compression numbers are easy with a pair of tools:\nmemory_pressure\nvm_stat\n\nI don't think any invocation of ps will do the trick, but maybe someone can correct that. You can see the implementation details on this thread: vm_compressor_mode (vm.compressor_mode) values for enabled compressed memory in OS X\nThe best I can get you is to look at all \"swapped and/or compressed\" memory using the vmmap command. Basically, before swapping, the memory regions marked for swapping are compressed. If that saves enough space to alleviate the swap algorithm, no swap happens. If not, the compressed regions are swapped to storage.\nvmmap -swapped [PID]\n\nYou'd have to handle the addition of the regions and I'm not sure if the activity monitor reports all swapped and compressed in the column you mentioned but that's something you might be able to figure out by inspection and/or using Instruments from Xcode to correlate what you see from the command line with activity monitor for some processes.\n\nA: It works for me :\nVAR=`top -l 1 | awk '/processName/  {print $10 }'`\n\nTo get compressed + normal memory\nVAR=`top -l 1 | awk '/processName/  {print $8 + $10 }'`\n\n\nA: ActivityMonitor: click the Memory button, then choose CompressedMemory column.\n", "Q: Profile Manager not sending email invitations After installing a new copy of OSX Server I started the Profile Manager and wanted to add some users and enroll them for the VPP Managed Distribution (I am already registered for VPP).\nIn the VPP Managed Distribution section I hit \"Resend invitation...\" and a success message is displayed, but no invitation is received.\nThe possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Missing SSL certificate\n\n*Misconfigured e-mail in OSX server\n\n*Misconfigured DNS\n\n\nI tried different email addresses and checked spam, but none of it helped.\nWhy are my invitations not sent?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*When you acquire VPP app licenses for free applications, are they appearing in your Apps tab in the Profile Manager [device manager interface] sidebar?\n\n*Have your devices successfully enrolled to Profile Manager, and can you deploy configuration payloads/profiles to them?\n\nWe ran into this when getting OS X Server and PM up and running, and then realized you can distribute apps and books without requiring the user to approve these VPP invitations.\nUnless you're attempting to deploy internal/enterprise apps, you can deploy App Store/VPP apps to devices or device groups as long as they are enrolled to Profile Manager (supervised or not, they should deliver as long as your config profiles are).\nEDIT: You should also make sure that you have an APNs account and that APNs is enabled in your OS X Server, with an updated token.\n\nIf you‘re not getting Apple push notifications - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203609\nResolve issues with Profile Manager in macOS Server -  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201063\n\n", "Q: Linux VM installation on MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra 10.12 Using MacBook 13\" Retina display with macOS Sierra 10.12.\nI already have Boot Camp option along with Windows. \nWill it be possible for me to use VM on the same machine for Linux?\n\nA: I prefer VirtualBox (free), but any works.

I have an iPhone 7 Plus running 10.1.1. Everything works fine but I have a audible notice that goes off every morning at 8:00am. The problem is I don't know what it is from. I checked the clock app and I don't have any alarms set. I thought it was the Golden Days app, but even after removing it, the notice gots off. I have several items in OmniFocus that are due at 8:00am, but to my knowledge OmniFocus does not use audible notifications. I am stumped.\nAny guidance on how to track down and shut off this daily notice would be appreciated.\n\nA: My apologies to the community for the long delay in responding to this question. I finally figured out that it was the Reminders app that was going off each morning at 8:00am. Even though no reminders were showing up on the lock screen of my iPhone, the alarm went off dutifully. \nThe solution: turn off notification for Reminders in the Notification Center.\n", "Q: Custom short commands to open apps Is it possible to create custom short commands to run apps and open folders, to be called in Spotlight?\nI mean, I'd like to create custom commands so I just open Spotlight (⌘ + space) then run things like:\n\n\n*\n\n*cEnter to run /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome\n\n*sEnter to run /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\n\n*gEnter to run /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --app=\"https://mail.google.com\"\n\n*wEnter to run /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --app=\"https://web.whatsapp.com\"\n\n*workEnter to open the folder /Users/myusername/Documents/workspace/\n\n*servEnter to run something in the Terminal\n\n\nAnd so on...

Then it is just Win+R to run my stuff. Trying to figure out a equivalent on Mac. Adding a folder to $PATH and creating executable scripts in it didn't work.\n\nA: Spotlight can't do this. You can probably hack something using AppleScript, Automator etc, but it might be easier to use Alfred which allows for this and a lot of other interesting things.\n\nFor your scenario it will actually learn which application you pick from the list and offer it as the default selection after a few times.\n\nA: Automator is what you want - for example, when you open automator, choose 'Folder Action' to set up an automation for your 'work' folder.\nSome of it will require learning a bit of AppleScript.\n", "Q: Is it safe to disconnect external Time Machine backup drive, if the encrypting is not finished? I have set up a 4TB external USB drive to use as a backup for my 2TB MacBook Pro.

The best resolution I can get on the cinema display is 1280x800.  Is there a way to get better resolution?\n\nA: Your particular model of MacBook Pro was equipped with an AMD Radeon HD 6750M dedicated graphics card and on-board Intel HD 3000 graphics card. In terms of VRAM you have 1 GB available on the AMD and 384 MB on the Intel (shared with main memory).\nThis combination is capable of up to 2560 x 1600 pixels on external displays that do not require a dual-link DVI connection.\nIf you're finding that the highest available resolution is 1280 x 800 instead of 2560 x 1600, this is likely due to you using a single-link DVI connection on a display that requires a dual-link DVI connection. Unfortunately, the 30\" Apple Cinema Display is one such monitor.\nYou would need to connect this display to a dual-link DVI port to access the higher resolutions available on the 30\" display. However, your model MacBook Pro does not provide a dual-link DVI connection without an appropriate adaptor and that is why it's not supporting the 30\" Apple Cinema Display at its native 2560 x 1600 resolution.  \nFor best results you will need to use a Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter.\nYou should refer to this info on Apple's website.

Every time I launch a particular application I have to go into my Users & Groups prefs and remove it from my startup items. How do I prevent applications from automatically becoming startup?\n\nA: Without specifying the exact application, this answer is only going to be generic.\nHowever, if removing an application from your login items doesn't prevent it from reappearing as a login item (or at startup), usually this means that the specific application's preferences are set to startup at launch, or login, etc. So you would need to go into the applications preferences and search for something along those lines and then disable it.\nIf this doesn't help, please clarify your question by including the specific application (and version) and also what version of macOS you're running.\n", "Q: Change background image through terminal on macOS Sierra I though of a random python program to take a URL and download the photo, then making it the Desktop background.

Will it remove both versions or just the version on your phone allowing you to redownload those messages at a later time?\n\nA: tl;dr: There is no online version, so it will only remove the messages on that specific device.\n\nFrom what I've seen, iMessages are stored locally, not on iCloud, with the exception of iCloud backups which do include iMessages from whatever you had stored on your device. In fact, the option for how long to save messages applies both to SMS and to iMessage texts, even though your cellular provider does not save your SMS messages. (If iMessages were stored online, you would probably also expect a Messages app on iCloud.com, which there isn't.)\nPossibly you are under the impression that it saves messages online because when you restored from an iCloud backup it included your messages, and when you scroll up to old parts of conversations it loads messages that hadn't displayed prior, but it's loading the extra messages that were already saved on your device. You can test this by opening a conversation thread while in Airplane Mode and scrolling to load old messages.\nFurther, if you set up a new device, and you do not restore anything from a backup (so it doesn't load your settings) but you still sign in to your Apple account, Messages would not automatically download your old messages.\nIf you change how long your device saves iMessages for, that will only affect that one device. Maybe you can have one device save messages for only 30 days to save room, and on another device you can have it save messages permanently.\n", "Q: Run a system wide keylogger I'd like to run a system wide keylogger (For purely educational/backup purposes of course) on Mac OS Sierra, how can I do it without buying expensive apps for that?\nI've been using logKext from github but it stopped working after upgrade from El Capitan.\nI almost got it working, but console is showing me Error: Daemon must run as root., I've tried to sudo chown root each file but to no use. \nAny ideas?

My iPhone 6 bootloops similar to this question: Why would my iPhone 6 be stuck in a dead battery loop?\nHowever, the answers there do not help. In addition, when I try to restore my iPhone, I get an Error 9. I have not tried a new USB cable, but I want to check if that is it before I buy a new one.\nI have tightened the battery and Lightning port connections, and this phone was never dropped in water.\n\nA: iFixit has a solution to your problem.  \n\nThe iPad in my experience is very picky about what cables it will restore with. Error 9 is almost always related to the cable, NOT the dock connector/flex cable. Use the official Apple cable if you still have it, or borrow one from a friend.\n  \n\ntl;dr: It's the cable's fault, plug your iPhone into iTunes and update your software again with a different cable.\nThis has happened to me before. Trying to update software on an old iPod Touch by connecting it to iTunes with a non-MFi cable, got an error message and a crash. Replacing the cable with a genuine Apple one fixed my issue.\nIf you're looking for a cheap, MFi-certified cable, try this $6 one from Anker. Or get the official $19 one.\n\nA: The error 9 mostly caused by the faulty cable/port. As Owlswipe said, the first thing is to change a new USB cable and try again. Then ensure the connection between iPhone and computer is normal. Note that you might need to install the latest version of iTunes and close all virtualization apps to ensure the well-off access of Apple Servers. BTW, if your phone has jailbroken before, it might be the reason for the error 9. \nAnother way you can try is restoring your phone in recovery mode/DFU mode. Both methods can help you force restore your iPhone but the later one can eliminate the software issue, you can get more details in the how to fix iPhone stuck in boot loop article.\n\nA: you can google iphone error 9 to find a solution to fix it. I have face the same problem before. \nMethod 1. RecoveryTool Fix Recovery can fix it successfully.\nMethod 2. Open iTunes, connect the phone and put it to the DFU mode ( press home and power button together, when the screen goes dark release the power button, but keep pressing the home button, until you hear the sound of the computer recognizing USB device) and then restored it. \n\nA: *\n\n*Force restart the iPhone.\nYou need to hold down the Sleep button and the Home button at the same time until you see the Apple logo.\n\n*Update the iOS version and update iTunes.\n\n*Check the security software and firewall:\nStart the security software and go to the firewall to check if iTunes is in the whitelist.\nIf you have virtualized applications on your computer, you will need to turn them off (for example, VMWare or Parallels).\n\n*Put the iPhone in DUF mode or use iTunes to restore the iPhone.\nOther useful tips and official guides: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201444\n", "Q: How to fix system.log filling up with servermgrd \"Record of type dsRecTypeStandard:Config named 'ServicesInformation101004'?

I went through iTunes and unchecked all of the music I wanted removed and then made sure that I had selected the option to only sync checked music.\nHowever, when I sync my iPhone nothing changes - all the songs are still there. I've tried everything - I have all the music I want gone unchecked in my iTunes library on my computer as well as in the \"On My Device\" section of iTunes when I plug my phone in. I can't find any solutions to this problem online, you guys are my last hope.\nMy computer is a MacBook Pro 2011 currently running OSX Yosemite, my phone is an iPhone 5s, and my current version of iTunes is 12.4.0.119.\n\nA: Have you got Autofill activated?\nAutofill can be used with either automatic sync or managing your content manually. When using automatic sync, simply select/deselect the Automatically fill free space with songs option found on the Music sync settings.\nThis option automatically selects music to fill the remaining space on your device. It does this by filling up the space that isn’t already being used up by the music, videos, books, apps, podcasts, etc you’ve manually selected. \nThis random selection will also adjust automatically as you make changes in the future. For example, iTunes will automatically remove some of the “autofilled” songs to make room for other things you manually select as wanting to sync in the future.\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*Each time you select/deselect the Automatically fill free space with songs option found on the Music sync settings option, you need to perform another sync for it to take effect on your iPhone.\n\n*If you've been managing music manually, the Autofill option is found in the On This iPhone section of your iTunes device sync settings. It appears as a button that does the same thing I described above but also provides an additional drop-down menu to the left that allows you to limit the Autofilled music to a specific playlist rather than randomly selecting content from your entire music library.\n\n", "Q: Disable background app refresh for ONLY Messages app iOS 10 has made the Messages app drain my wife's iPhone 6's battery. \nIt uses up about 40% of her battery and most of that is background time. \nHow can I turn off background refresh for ONLY Messages?  \n(Not looking for a solution that turns off all background refreshes.)\n\nA: It sounds like you're trying to address the symptom, rather than the problem. To be clear, Messages should not be using up that much battery power. I suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your wife's iPhone by holding down the Power and Home buttons simultaneously for about 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo\n\n*Wait for her iPhone battery stats to refresh. \n\n\nNOTE:\nThis may take up to a day - typically it will need to be plugged back into a charger and fully charged and then removed and used normally for a few hours up to a day before the battery stats will refresh. \nOnce you've done this, let us know if your wife is still having this problem.\n", "Q: Star ratings in iOS 10.2?

How do I turn this on?\n\nA: For me it does show. I'm running iOS 10.2 on my iPhone 6s. I found it under 'Setttings > Music'. \n\nAfter that open the Action sheet of a song. And there you find the 'Rate Song...' button. Pressing this button will show a pop up with 'Star Rating'. \n\n\n\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue and have been working with Apple tech support all night! PROBLEM SOLVED!\nPlease try and follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back-up your iPhone;\n\n*Go to your iTunes library and stat-rate one of your songs; \n\n*Now, sync your phone again;\n\n*Go back to Music setting under 'General' and see if 'Show Star rating' switch is there. \n\n*Switch it on and you will see star-rating for individual songs in music. \n\n\nBackground INFO: Apple removed star rating in iOS 10, so literally all your star ratings were removed and set back to NONE.

Perhaps you meant one of these?\" and then displays a bunch of contacts that start with the letter U.\nThis is really annoying... I use Siri all the time and almost never, ever, have even the slightest problem getting her to do whatever I need.  But this particular phrase just seems to stump her.  The text readout of what she thinks I said is perfect, but her response is not.\nIncidentally Voice Dial is off, in case anyone thinks that's related.\nWhy is she misinterpreting this and insisting that I'm trying to call a specific contact?\n\nA: It's because you're using the words \"to call\". By default Siri is interpreting this as you wanting to call a contact, which in this case is missing.\nPerhaps you could just change the words to something like:\n\"Hey Siri, remind me on January first to change the address for US Bank\"\nThis should just create a reminder for 9am on 1st January to change the address for US bank.\n", "Q: Macbook keyboard incorrect mappings My gut is telling me this is a hardware problem, but I thought I'd ask here just in case.\nI just got a 'new' refurbished Macbook Pro Retina 2013.

I can plug in a USB keyboard and it works just fine.\nIs there a way to reinstall the keyboard firmware on a Mac to test for that? Or am I hosed, with the only option being to send it back for (further) repair?\n\nA: I would reset both your NVRAM and your SMC. See below for instructions.\nReset your NVRAM\nNewer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you resetting this. Here’s how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\nReset the SMC\nYour computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can also be reset.

I was wondering how am I supposed to transfer my clash royale account to a new device without game center?\n\nA: You can still login into Game Center inside the Settings. On a new device you login into Game Center with the same Apple ID as your old device and your done. \n\nSo all the synchronization of high scores, progress and achievements still works. Apple decided to focus on the background technology for Game developers instead of the stand alone app. \n", "Q: Shutdown \"no tty present and no askpass program specified\"? I'm trying to run a shutdown script remotely on multiple Macs.

The only message after that is: sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified\nAny ideas how I can fix this?\nMy user is definitely a super-user\n\nA: The error message appears when you try to run a command inside your bash call with sudo and, although the user ADMIN on the destination system mac123 has permissions to run commands with sudo, the option NOPASSWD is not specified for this particular user (in /etc/sudoers).\nSystem would have to prompt user and wait for the password to be provided from the keyboard, however as no terminal is attached, the prompt would hang forever.\nAs a measure against such situation, system fails with the error message you got.\n\nIf you took time to understand my yesterday's answer:\n\nprovided ADMIN has passwordless sudo permissions for shutdown or all commands on macxxx machine)\n\nYou wouldn't run into this problem.\nYou should modify your script:\n...\nif [ $DAYS_UP -ge ${MAX_UPDAYS} ];then\n    echo Mac is going to shutdown \n    sudo shutdown -h now\nelse\n...\n\nAnd edit the sudoers file on mac123, so that it contains, for example (it must match the command in the script):\nADMIN ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown -h now\n\nBear in mind that you must do it using visudo program, otherwise you will likely break your system completely.\n\nAlternatively you can use SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable and point it to a script providing the password (the second part of the error message).

It would also help if I could type in a non password input field to test. Is this possible?\n\nA: Method 1: Go into the Guest User(if it is there) and change the language.\nMethod 2: See Mac os X - locked outside my account (language!).\nMethod 3: Try booting into recovey mode(holding cmd+R at boot). Then you should be able to change the keyboard layout(in the menu bar).\nMethod 4: See https://superuser.com/q/871277.\n\nA: Restarting my mac in safe mode 4 or 5 times solved the issue for me.\nReason: When restarting in safe mode, mac clears all the font cache and setting. \n", "Q: How to prevent a thief from using my iPhone ever?

For daily use you use TouchID anyway. But after 24 hours not using it, it will request a password.\n\n*Activate Find My iPhone, it includes Activation Lock, a feature that's designed to prevent anyone else from using your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple Watch if it's ever lost or stolen. Activation Lock is enabled automatically when you turn on Find My iPhone.\n\n*As soon as you know that your iPhone is missing, put it in 'Lost mode'.\n\n*Use a strong password for your iCloud account. \n\n*Enable two-factor identification for your iCloud account. Make sure you can use 2 devices for it. And store the recovery key in a safe place.\n\n\nA: These Articles HT201472 and HT201365 from Apple clearly explain what you can do to in case your phone is lost or stolen. \nTo Answer all of your questions:\nYes there is a way to prevent anybody from using your phone. When the phone gets stolen you put your device in lost mode as explained in the articles above. No one will be able to re-use / re-active your phone without your Apple ID and password because of the Activation Lock that is enabled when you put the device in lost mode.\nWith Activation Lock, your Apple ID and password is required before anyone can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Find My iPhone on your device\n\n*Erase your device\n\n*Reactivate and use your device\n\n\nTo put your device in lost mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*From any iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, log into the Find My iPhone app using your Apple ID. You don’t have to log in Find My iPhone from a device that you own (ie. it could be a friend’s device), but you must login using the same Apple ID/password as the device you are trying to put into Lost Mode.\n\n*Once logged in, Find My iPhone will show a map and a list of devices that are linked to your Apple ID. Tap on the device you have lost or that was stolen to select it.\n\n*Tap on the “Actions” button at the bottom of the screen, then tap on “Lost Mode.”\n\n*You will be asked to confirm you want to turn Lost Mode on. Tap on “Turn On Lost Mode…” to continue.\n\n*If the device you are trying to put in Lost Mode doesn’t have a passcode, Find My iPhone will require you to set one up on the spot. Type in a passcode and type the new passcode again to confirm. If you already have a passcode enabled on the device, then you can go straight to the next step.\n\n*You will now have the option of entering a phone number where you can be reached. This phone number will be displayed on the Lock screen of your device. Although optional, it is highly recommended you add your phone number so people can reach you if they find your device. Tap “Next” when done.\n\n*Finally, you can enter a message to display on the Lock screen along with your phone number. By default, the message is “This iPhone has been lost. Please call me.” but you can customize it the way you want. Tap “Done” in the upper right corner to activate Lost Mode.\n\n*If someone tries to plug your iPhone in iTunes to restore it, they won’t be able to and they will see the following message, asking them to first turn off Find My iPhone.\n\n", "Q: administrator account with parental control? what is the use of having a parental control on and administrator account?\nI have a mac where a 12 years old girl is using, she can do what ever she like (install apps, chat, etc) but want to have restriction on web sites against porn, etc\ncurrently she has admin account, and I see that i can activate the parental control on!

It appears when I have the FileVault enabled and it behaves like this: when booting the laptop it takes 2 or 3 minutes until it gets to the login screen  and once it gets there I can't type anything and can barely move the cursor.\nMy current configuration is: 13-inch rMBP w/ macOS Sierra, 8GB RAM and somewhere around 30% available disk space. I've tried a PRAM/SMC reset but no lock. Also the diagnostics tool didn't return any error and in the recovery mode I couldn't find any disk errors to fix (before and after disabling FileVault). Even if I boot in Safe Mode successfully, after restarting it gets into the same issue again. \nI've tried tailing the system log, disabling useless .plist files and launch daemons that could've influenced the boot time. I've also tried unplugging all my peripherals and it's the same situation. However, with the FileVault disabled it doesn't get stuck in the login screen, but it still needs 1 minute to boot. \nI know about a similar issue with the MySQL daemon on Sierra, but it's not my case... I don't have any database installed locally. The single thing would be several homebrew packages that I don't see how they could influence the boot time. I've been pretty desperate with this issue and been trying to avoid starting from scratch with a clean install, because that would imply a lot of configuration.\nOne thing that I remember is that on El Capitan I didn't have this issue at all or anything related to startup and the boot time was generally of several seconds. Is there any solution or at least a method to give me a hint what's taking so long to boot my machine? Any help will be much appreciated.\n\nA: I have had this exact problem.\nI have a 2015 13\" MBP running Yosemite (Mac OS X 10.10.5), not Sierra, though I have 8gb RAM and about 20% free space on an aftermarket 500gb SSD (e.g. not Apple factory installed). I use the laptop constantly and travel a lot with it. I've run into this bizarre boot/lag problem with FileVault roughly 2x-3x a year, and as luck would have it, it usually happens when I don't have access to any hands-on tech support besides myself.\nThe only thing that works for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable FileVault: boot into Recovery Mode (command-R after startup chime) or if you have another boot partition. I have a TechTool Pro (TTP) emergency boot partition. Run Apple's Disk Utility from that boot partition and use the \"Turn Off Encryption\" command.\n\n*Reset the SMC: shut down computer; hold shift-control-option-power for at least 10 seconds; start up computer.\n\n*Once decrypted, run disk utilities on that drive. Besides Apple's Disk Utility for disk and permissions repair, I use TTP's \"Volume Rebuild\" tool (once I've booted from the emergency partition).\n\n*Use the drive for a few days un-encrypted, with several clean reboots.\n\n*Boot back into Recovery or emergency partition and run all those utilities again.\n\n*Turn FileVault back on.\n\n\nThis typically works for me. However, it's annoying and time-consuming to resolve. And this is a repair, not a fix.

I realize this is a long shot, and iOS quite possibly makes this impossible, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who wants this, and this is the best place to ask.\nI can use any bluetooth keyboard with my phone, and using Type2Phone I can direct a bluetooth signal from my laptop to my phone while it charges, and while I'm mainly using my laptop.  But then using the touch screen is very awkward.  I'd like to do the same thing with my trackpad that I do with my keyboard, so if I need to briefly use an iOS app while I'm working, I don't have to repeatedly take it off the stand every time.\n\nA: While you can pair a bluetooth keyboard with an iOS device and use it, Apple does not support for pairing a bluetooth mouse or trackpad.\nI did find that there is a third-party app for use on jailbroken iOS devices that allow you to do what you want. It provides an alternative Bluetooth Stack which provides the ability to use the trackpad or mouse. See here for more info.\n\nA: Do not think it works as a standalone device.

This has a 2560x1440 resolution.\nI have a MacBook Pro Retina (early 2013). I now have the following issue getting to this maximum resolution.\n1) HDMI\nIf I attach the monitor through HDMI I only get a resolution of 2048 x 1152. I first thought it was the HDMI cable so I bought a new one, no effect. When connected through HDMI everything else (close lid etc) works perfectly.\n2) DisplayPort cable\nThe Dell also came with a Mini DP to DP cable. If I use that cable it works perfectly when I startup the MacBook from scratch. So, the beautiful full resolution of 2560x1440 is there!\nHOWEVER, when I close the lid or the MacBook goes to sleep it somehow \"loses\" the monitor. The Mac still thinks the Dell is there. It is there in the menu and you can even go with your mouse to the second monitor, the Dell itself however remains completely black. So the only way of getting the monitor to work again is fully power off the Mac and then power it on. This is of course not a workable situation.\nSo, does anybody now how to solve this, either through a working HDMI or a way to get the DP connection to work normally.\nThanks!\n\nA: The early 2013 MacBook Pro models only officially supported an external resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels (via HDMI) or up to 2560 x 1600 pixels (via Thunderbolt).\nSo, in terms of your first point about your HDMI connection, you're doing better than Apple's official specs.\nAs far as your second point, it's unclear to me whether you're trying to use the MacBook Pro in clamshell mode or not. I'm going to provide some generic advice that should help, but if not you may need to clarify your question. I'm also assuming your Computer is connected to a power socket and not running off battery.\nI would reset both your NVRAM and your SMC. See below for instructions.\nReset your NVRAM\nNewer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you resetting this. Here’s how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\nReset the SMC\nYour computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can also be reset. To reset this on your particular MacBook Pro, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter doing both these, let us know how you go.\n", "Q: OSX/MacOS Search priority for app when opening custom extension I'm new to the Mac world but have written my first application.

When you open a .xyz file it will open with my_application.app. However, I'm noticing if I have several my_application.app on my machine it's hard to figure out which one will load when you double click on a .xyz file. \nFor instance, I had my_application.app in my applications folder, but I also had one (an older version) on my desktop. I expected the one in the applications folder to handle opening .xyz files, but instead the one from the desktop opened.\nIs there definitive documentation on what the search priority is for finding an app for a custom file extension?\n\nA: You can choose which application must handle a file type. And change the default application. \nYou can do it once:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right mouse click on file\n\n*Open with...\n\n*It opens the file in the chosen application once. \n\n\n\nOr you can decide which application must open all files for a particular file type. \n\n\n*\n\n*Right mouse click on file\n\n*Get Info\n\n*Section 'Open with'\n\n*Choose the application you want to use for all files from this file type. \n\n*Press the 'Change All...' button\n\n\n\n\nA: There isn't a search priority. You can associate just one application as the default application for a file type.\nYou seem to think that application stored in the /Applications folder are somehow \"better\" or \"more correct\" or perhaps that it is the only place to store application.

I am using the Dvorak keyboard map on my Mac, I used to just switch keys from the keyboard to have a nice Dvorak keyboard.\nDoes any one know if there is a simple way to replace keys on the new Mac Book Pro released this last fall?\n\nA: I just removed two keys on mine: can't believe there's no good info out there on this yet. The clips are on all four corners of the key, but you should only pry the top edge of the key as the clips on the bottom are designed to slide off toward the bottom, rather than pull straight up. I used a thin piece of plastic (the plastic-only edge of a laminated tag) to pry the top edge. A credit card would probably work but might be a little stiff for the initial pry.\nOnce you have the top clips off slide the key down until the bottom clips are off as well. It's a nice flat surface underneath, I had no qualms about cleaning with a damp cloth. To replace the key slide the bottom clips on in an upward direction, then press the top clips into place once the key is centered in place.\n\nA: I also have rearranged my physical keys to the Dvorak layout on my past machines and am concerned about being able to do so on my 2016 model. I think it will be significantly harder than previous years, but considering it's been done with the Macbook's butterfly keyboard, which was even shallower, I think we might be able to do it. \nYou may want to look into what tools iFixit uses to pry off keycaps.\nI think the best tool will be something thin without a sharp point so that the force is distributed throughout the key. You can see that in iFixit's teardown, they broke part of the key: https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/Xoa5bxb5rwbDjJTf.huge.

This USB Type-C charger comes with Power Delivery 60W:\n\nCan I use it as an alternative for charing my MacBook Pro 13\" (late 2016)?\n\nA: Generally speaking, using a charger with a lower watage rating than the charger that came with the device will just mean that the device will take a longer time to charge. As long as the charger delivers the correct voltage (which is set by the USB specifications) it will not damage the device. Thus, if you trust that the charger properly follows the specifications laid out by the USB industry group, it should not pose a danger, but could take longer than a \"proper\" charger.\nUsing a charger with a higher watage rating should also work, but has the potential danger of allowing the device to draw more power than is safe for the device. In this case you would need to trust that the device maker has followed good design process and limits the power that it draws rather than just taking the maximum that the charger can push out.\nI trust Apple not to allow their devices to draw more power than they can handle, and thus often hook up low power MacBookAir devices to high power MacBookPro chargers.\n\nA: I own a Macbook Pro 13\" (2016) and the Anker charger in the picture.  I'm using it right now as a power source.  So it works, without setting anything on fire (so far).  However, there's an important caveat: The Anker charger DOES NOT deliver the 60 watts the Macbook Pro wants over the USB-C port. \n\n\n*\n\n*The Apple power source delivers a max 61 watts (20.3v @ 3A).  Though according to this test at GTrusted, when charging the macbook pro is actually drawing 60 watts (specifically: 20 volts @ 3 amps). I know, it's just a watt, but rating the charger at the odd 61 watt while it's only delivering 60, seems like a silly way to make the official Apple charger appear proprietary.  Whatever.\n\n*The Anker charger delivers a max 45 watts (15v @ 3A). So it likely takes a little longer to get a full charge, but I haven't timed it or noticed. Here is the gruesome detail. EDIT: I did some testing, and it looks like it's only getting 30 watts (15v @ 2A).\n\n\nThis is important, because it potentially means travelling with just one universal charger for a macbook, iphone, ipad, wireless headphones, etc. -- if you're willing to take a hit on charge time for the macbook.  \nHere's what I don't know: does the delivery of 45 watts, instead of the optimal 60, have any negative impact on the computer.  Specifically, does it a) harm the battery life over time, or b) risk damaging the computer, battery or power source when using the computer under heavy loads (screen at 100%, heavy load on CPU, etc)?\nBottom-line:\n1. It charges a macbook pro 13\" (2016), but...\n2. ... Not as fast as is possible with\n    the Apple-supplied charger\n3. It's not clear to me whether it could\n    cause damage over the longer term.\nIt would be great to see Anker or someone make a similar product delivering 60 watts with 20 volts @ 3 amps (Apple can keep it's extra watt) through the USB-C port.  That would solve everything.  \n", "Q: Do iMessage or text messages show sent or received time after your iPhone is off?

When the cursor changes to left/right arrows separated by | – just press left mouse button and drag it to the right expanding left column and bringing back the info you are missing now.\n\n", "Q: Qt Creator and iTerm2 Qt Creator opens the UGLY Terminal app for running/debugging programs.

(Similar to this How can I remove an autocomplete suggestion from Safari's address bar?, but those answers do not help)\nA site I visit frequently is located at:\nhttp://example.com/sub\n\nUnfortunately when I begin typing \"exa\" in the address bar, I get two propositions in top hits:\nhttp://example.com\nhttp://example.com/sub\n\nwith the first being highlighted, and used if I (miss the arrow down key and) hit enter\nI have bookmarked and favorited the http://example.com/sub site and try to never visit http://example.com but never the less it always shows as top site.\nI cleared my history of each and every entry to http://example.com/* except for http://example.com/sub, and redo that step every time I accidently visit the wrong site\nAnd no, I don't want do delete my whole browsing history\n\nA: It's actually not possible to remove the root domain from Safari's top hits. I've always had this problem and find it irritating.\n\nAs seen, I've never visited Apple's US website, but only the SG site. However, it still auto completes to it.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the problem is that Safari autofills the root domain, before auto completing the sub domain.\nSo, even if you don't visit http://example.com, it would still show up since you visit /sub.\n\nA: After brainstorming for days, I finally managed to find a solution. Putting it here since it may help others. Clearing history on one or all your devices doesn't help. All you need to do is show your Bookmarks from the bookmarks tab, search for the website you want removed from the top hits (it only shows in top hits because it's in your bookmarks) and delete it from there. That's it, the said top hit will stop appearing on all your iCloud devices. \nWhat's rather disappointing in all this is even tech savvy people need to bang their head around to find a solution to such a simple problem. In Google Chrome, you can simply select that top result and delete it.\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to track quality of code in my xcode project for ios? I really need to confirm with independent tool very bad quality of code in one of ios projects written in swift.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any tool for this?\n\n*how it works?\n\n\nA: Swift-Clean\nAn OS X app that works with Xcode to keep your Swift code clean. Swift-Clean takes the answers you give to a short survey on Swift coding style and creates a configuration file. The Mac app then uses this to either fix errors automatically or create build warnings if it can't. Once you've completed the survey, you can not only download your own configuration file, but you can also choose from the average of all responses or the Stack Overflow results.\n\nTaylor\nA tool that aims to improve Swift code quality, by checking for conformance of code metrics. Unlike similar linting tools, Taylor focuses on more subjective code quality metric by providing warnings for rules such as excessive class or method length, too many overly complicated methods, excessive block depth or too many method parameters. It can be run independently from the command line on a single file or a complete project, or you can add a build phase to add warnings to Xcode.\n", "Q: What is \"xART Remote Storage Daemon\" in macOS? I found in my newly installed macOS system there is a service running on port 61500 and the process command is /usr/libexec/xartstorageremoted\nI issued man xartstorageremoted and found the manual of this deamon. After reading it I still don't understand what is this deamon used for. I searched Google and there is nearly nothing about it. Does anyone know something about it? What it used for in a common user's perspective?\n\nThe xartstorageremoted executable is a daemon intended to listen for save/fetch requests from the CoProcessor. This daemon is required for multi-partitions and multi-users support.\nxartstorageremoted must not be unloaded and should only be run via launchd when a request must be handled.\n\n\nA: Nice.

It’s also in charge of your webcam, a small but important difference.\n", "Q: iOS 10.2 + Safari + Client Certificates crashes Safari Yesterday I updated my iPhone 6S to iOS 10.2, and now I cannot access web sites requiring client certificates. Safari prompts me for the client certificate to use but then immediately crashes. I tried with my iPad running iOS 10.0.1 and it works just fine. On my Mac / PC it works with any browser whatsoever.\nCan someone else confirm this problem? \n\nA: Ok.

I've switched to Linux recently due to my work specifics, now I want to downgrade to free iCloud storage plan, but the related apple support page only describes how to manage iCloud subscription using OSX, iOS and Windows PC.\nIs there any other way to cancel iCloud subscription without those devices?\n\nA: If you can borrow a computer or iOS device, you can use that to sign into iCloud and then change to settings that way. This is probably the only way to do it yourself without calling Apple directly and seeing if they will do it for you.\nApple devices will have iCloud software already installed, but for Windows machines, you would need to download the iCloud software and install it - https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204283\nOther than installing a VM running Windows, there is no iCloud software for Linux.\n", "Q: Leaving battery in storage I am going to be away from my rMBP for 2 weeks, I powered it off and left it with around 56% of battery charge, anything I should do differently / didn't do? in order to keep the battery in a good condition without causing damage (losing capacity or getting it in too deep discharge state).\n\nA: That's perfectly ok.

They are supposed to be available in the Library of the TV app but my Library page is completely blank with no options.\n\nA: The TV app currently cannot accept video content synced from iTunes. There are 2 explanations:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes itself needs an upgrade to understand that videos should be synced to the TV app instead of the Videos app\n\n*Apple has decided that you should not be able to sync video content from the iTunes app at all, only download from iTMS or stream from approved providers.\n\n\nI think it is the first one.

But I came to this thing where I had to approve my iPhone. I have no other Apple device so I'm stuck. \nHow do I approve my iPhone?\n\nA: From what I have gathered in my own frustrating search tonight is that without any other apple devices you have to select \"can't activate this phone\" from the bottom and you will lose only your saved passwords in keychain, meaning if you don't remember them you will have a not so fun time resetting those that were forgotten, but if you're not concerned with losing your keychain passwords then don't worry nothing will change. \nFor those of you who stumble across this issue and have a MacBook which doesn't get a pop-up window, (my situation earlier) go to your settings on your MacBook and find keychain under iCloud preferences, it should say iPhone is waiting for verification.

What is more, when another person tries to use his 2016 Macbook Pro, he encounters the same problem.\nDoes anyone know what settings or configurations we can check either on the Macs or the network to fix this? \nAny advice is appreciated.\n\nA: Try this setting, it helped me in the same situation :) In the network settings change the address of DNS servers to Google's ones: 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4\nFor this go to Settings > Network > Advanced... > DNS > press + and enter DNS address.\n\nOr, vice versa, you may ask your system administrator for any specific DNS and probably proxy settings that your company might have due to security reasons and then enter them in the Proxy tab.\n\n", "Q: When using CMD-Tab, how to re-open the app's main window? I hit this problem often when interacting with some Apple applications, mainly Messages and iTunes.\nAfter starting a song with iTunes, to clear my screen and get back to work I close the iTunes window with CMD-W. The iTunes application is still running in my Dock and playing music.\nAfter some time, I want to switch to a different album. I CMD-Tab to select the iTunes application. iTunes is focused in the menu bar. But no window is shown, because I previously closed the window.\nThis workflow occurs for all apps, and is not usually a problem. If I switch to Safari and no window is open, I simply press CMD-T or CMD-N to open a new tab or new window.\nWith iTunes, I press CMD-N and nothing happens. No iTunes window is created or shown. The Application is focused, but the main window is not re-opened if it is currently closed.\nI end up clicking on the Dock, which (in addition to focusing the application) opens a new iTunes window if that window was previously closed.\nThis breaks my (usually more efficient) CMD-Tab workflow. If I'm forced to click the iTunes dock icon, I may as well just click the dock icon from the start and forgo the keyboard shortcut.\nMessages has a similar problem. If I receive a desktop notification and use CMD-Tab to open Messages to respond, the application will be focused but no window will be opened. I can press CMD-N, which in Message's case does open a new window, but the \"new message\" cell will be opened rather than the existing conversation I had open and now want to respond to.\nWhen clicking the Dock icon or opening the app via a Spotlight Search, if the main window is not open then it will be re-opened. Is there a way to force this behavior for CMD-Tab app selection?\nHow do I show the main window when the Application is focused via CMD-Tab?\n\nA: There exists a shortcut for that, though it requires certain dexterity:\nCommand-Tab to the app, but then, before releasing Command, hold Option.\nIf you then release Command while still holding Option, the window should pop open.\nIt's just like clicking in the app icon in the Dock (if there are no windows open, one opens; if there is a minimized window, it appears again).\n\nA: Several applications including iTunes let you switch views by using CMD +<number>.  CMD + 0 will give you the main window. But some applications like iTunes offer different views.\nJust try CMD+tab to iTunes and then variate between CMD + 1 to 9 to see which view you like.

The Finder spent an hour trying to draw the contents of the Applications folder, & even then wouldn't launch anything, claiming every app was damaged.\nI could switch to the other account & launch the same app with no issues.\nConsole showed constant crash reports in launchd each time with a new PID\nI couldn't find which process coresponded to any given PID as it was changing too fast but it looked like mdworker was also struggling.\nI used Activity Monitor from the other account to kill all mdworkers & also spotlight & things settled down - though I couldn't go back to the main account without it starting over.\nEventually I gave up & did a full restore from Time Machine.\nFine. Worked.\nI then split the updates & tried again.\nSafari update, OK.\nSecurity Update... back to square one.\n[fade to black]\nI'm now on another Time Machine restore & am not going near that Security Update on any machine in the building until I hear better news from elsewhere.\n[I have probably missed 42 steps in my exploratory method, it's been 12+ hours... please ask for clarification - bearing in mind I don't have the console logs as they were wiped with each restore]\n\nA: (I would add this as a comment, not an answer, but the system won't let me comment.)\nI installed Security update 2016-003 on my iMac running OS 10.11.6 (El Capitan) on Dec 13. Since then I have had two kernel panics, one on trying to wake the computer and one today on startup.\nThe panic on startup occurred with the Apple logo and progress bar still on screen. There was a single line of text at upper left of the screen announcing the panic. No panic report in logs for that one.\nApple diagnostic test says there are no hardware problems, so I strongly suspect the security update is causing these panics.\nUpdate Dec 21: In my case the kernel panics stopped occurring after I updated Little Snitch from 3.6.4 to 3.7.1. Compatibility with Sierra was added at v3.7.0. Perhaps that also provides compatibility with the El Capitan security update 2016-003. Or perhaps it was just the Little Snitch reinstall process that fixed things.\n\nA: Had slightly different symptoms with Security Update 2016-003 El Capitan on my iMac. Install last night of the iTunes, Safari, and Security updates completed with no errors. Noticed characteristic PRAM update screen and beep during restart. I shut down and went to bed. This morning when I powered up the boot never reached the loading screen and the iMac simply powered off.  Booted into safe mode, ran disk repair, no errors found. Tried restart, no joy.  Booted into Startup Manager, selected recovery disk, no joy, the iMac simply powered off again. Booted into Startup Manager once again and selected the default disk. Voila, good boot! So figured default boot disk setting was hosed in PRAM. Opened System Preferences | Startup Disk, selected the default disk, closed System preferences, and restarted. Good boot! Powered off.  Powered on, again good boot! Hope this helps someone...    \n", "Q: How does iOS know if a web site is restricted? I don't add these web sites to the restricted list. Is the iPhone sending every page I visit to Apple? Random surfing will encounter a random  restricted site. In this case it renders this app broken because the 'allow' link doesn't work. Setting is currently set to limit adult content which allows me to use a white list and blacklist. I never added this site to blacklist. I only blacklist 3 sites. \n\nHow does iOS know that a website is restricted? Does it send it every page I visit to Apple? \nHow does iOS know if a website is restricted? Does it send it every page I visit to Apple? \nSee this is the BS I'm talking about:\n\niOS 10.1.1\n\nA: Settings → Restrictions → Websites and select your preferred option for Allowed Websites.\n                                     \n\nA: As I guess you know, iOS limits websites based on the options you've selected in Settings > General > Restrictions > Websites.\nAs @grgarside shows with the screenshot in their answer, with Restrictions you can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow all websites\n\n*Limit Adult Content\n\n*Allow specific websites only\n\n\nBy using these settings you can also set whitelists etc.\nBased on your question, I assume you've limited adult content and every so often you'll try accessing a site that iOS has restricted. \nWith the Limit Adult Content filter enabled, there are several layers of filtering applied by iOS to web browsing. Apple has achieved this via a number of methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applying an automatic filter layer to prevent direct access to many adult sites\n\n*Enabling the various search engine based filtering options to prevent inappropriate terms from being queried independently\n\n*Adopting the likes of Google SafeSearch and similar from Bing, Yahoo, and others\n\n*The prevention of web searches for a wide variety of terms. \n\n\nIn your question you offered a single example via the Yanflex screenshot. However, since Yanflex is only a 3rd party method of accessing Cragslist, the likelihood in this specific case is that iOS has restricted something from the Craigslist servers. This is not surprising, as specific individual pages on Craigslist regularly appear in block lists because of their content.\nThe only way around this is when you encounter a specific page that is blocked that you don't want blocked, you will need to specifically allow it by going to Settings > General > Restrictions > Websites > Limit Adult Content and adding it to the Always Allow list. That is assuming you have enabled Limit Adult Content to begin with.\n\nA: In iOS 11 this has changed as the restrictions page has been removed.\nUpdated answer:\nGo to Settings-> Screen time -> Turn it on if necessary-> Content & Privacy restrictions -> Content Restrictions-> Web Content.\nScreen:\n\nYou can then choose between Limit adult websites which automatically blocks some websites, you can add to the list or allowed websites only which blocks all websites not in the allowed list.\n\nA: I had the same issue with Safari blocking Google searches at random despite not having any filters on. When I went to Settings/ Screen Time/ Turn Off Screen Time the problem stopped. I believe I had previously signed into Screen Time under 'This is My Child's Phone' by accident. I didn't have any issues with Safari after I signed back into Screen Time under 'This is My Phone'. Hope this helps someone else. \n", "Q: What's the purpose of the adhesive under iPhone 6s screen? (which doesn't exist in iPhone 6) I work in a workshop that repairs iPhones etc. \nI find it strange that the iPhone 6 doesn't have any glue/adhesive surrounding the enclosure rim under the display.  Yet, the iPhone 6s does.  \nWhen doing repairs to the iPhone 6s without the adhesive, the iPhone passes all tests we've done at the workshop and is perfectly functional.\nI have asked a number of Apple technicians about this, and none of them know for certain what the adhesive is for. Some speculate that the presence of this adhesive is just to make it difficult to remove the display, so that non Apple technicians using non-Apple tools will find it harder to remove, while others are guessing it was to make it more waterproof.\nCan someone shed some light on this so we can have some more certainty in the workshop when repairing iPhone 6s models? We want to ensure we're not adversely affecting customer iPhones in any way.\n\nA: The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were actually designed to be more water resistant (although not officially so). I've seen inside these and the difference compared to earlier models is obvious (the adhesive you refer to is one example). \nYou can read more about this here.\nHowever, do not mistaken this to mean the iPhone 6s has any sort of official IP rating. It does not. You may also be interested in my answer to this question.\n\nA: It is for water resistance. The later models have even more. \n", "Q: Shortcut on Mac: auto google a word/phrase in new window When doing research, for example, this shortcut is a big help.\nYou highlight a word or phrase on a webpage [then hold down the shortcut keys + hit spacebar, I think\n] and it will open a new page with a google search in a new window. \nI've seen this done.

I deleted them and closed the podcast app. Now each time I reopen the podcast app, one of the podcasts continues to reappear and attempts to start downloading an episode.\nI found this question that sounded oddly similar, but it had no answers.\nUpdate\nI tried removing all podcasts and syncing with iTunes on my computer (which shows no current podcast subscriptions), but this random podcast still appears.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure why this worked, but I reset my iPhone a second time and restored it from the same iCloud backup and that seems to have fixed it.\n", "Q: Wifi randomly turning itself off MacBook Pro I have a MacBook Pro mid-2012. I always had the common connectivity issues with wifi but now its beyond my comprehension. My wifi turns itself off randomly. Sometimes it works fine for days, other times the problem happens all day. It started when my Bluetooth speaker caused interference with the wifi signal causing it to run slow or disconnecting itself either the speaker or the wifi.\nThen one day the computer wifi started turning itself on and off every couple of seconds. I shut down the computer reseted the PRAM then wifi showed the crossed out icon with wifi:not configured message. Shut it down again did a SMC reset and a clean install of OS X now the problem appears randomly most of the time a reset will restore wifi but it shut itself off whenever it wants.\nAny solutions or ideas?\n\nA: I feel your pain.  I had this same problem with my 2012 Macbook Pro. My WiFi would lose connection, and I would have to turn it off and then back on to regain the connection.  Then it started giving me the \"WiFi not configured\" message when I would turn it back on. Sometimes a reboot, or PRAM reset, or several reboots/resets would resolve it for a little while.\nI will say there does not seem to be an easy fix.  Mine started having this problem when I installed Yosemite; my hunch (at least for my case which was very similar) is that is is a software/driver issue and not a hardware issue.  Call apple tech support.  \nI will say that mine was out of warranty, but they still helped me; they put me in touch with their engineers to work on the problem, gave me software diagnostic tools to figure out what was happening, and eventually were able to resolve my problem. They went to great lengths, and I am no longer working on a computer that has this issue thanks to them.\n", "Q: Cursor lag or sticky effect on links After upgrading to macOS Sierra I've noticed that my mouse cursor tends to lag, grab or stick to links when traversing over a web page.

How do I make the autocomplete local to the folder?\n\n\nA: If you want to see only binaries in the current folder, press ./tab (dot slash tab).\nIf you want to see all folders in the current folder, press cd tab\nIn your screenshot, pressingm tab is showing all binaries that start with m found in the path.\nIn all cases, pressing tab a second time will show all matches if there are more than one. \n\nA: You're looking for bash-completion. This post describes how to get it (tl;dr - for an easy install you'll need a package manager like Homebrew or MacPorts) for example:\nbrew install bash_completion\n\nWith bash-completion, typing cd and then Tab the results you get should be limited to folders.\nOut-of-the-box bash-completion covers a wide range of possible completions, but there may be more - check your package manager. For example, on Homebrew try this:\nbrew search completions\n\nThis returns additional completions for macOS tools like open and launchctl, virtualisation tools like docker and vagrant, and many others.\nYou can create your own completions, for example I use this one to show me only .png files for a script (png2icns) I hacked together.\ncomplete -f -X '!*.png' png2icns\n\nHowever this really isn't necessary for most cases - bash-completion will cover all the common uses.\nFor completeness I need to mention that fans of the zsh shell will no doubt tell you that zsh's support for completion is far superior to bash's! Personally, bash does what I need, albeit with a little help from brew.\n", "Q: How to hide previous commands/history in terminal and start like the beginning of the tab?

But I did the math and I have only used 1.879 GB out of 5.000 GB! Please help. I have tried deleting apps and restarting my phone but that didn't work. \n\nA: It sounds like you're looking at your available iCloud Storage rather than your device storage (which is different than 5 GB). You may have, for example, 15 GB out of 16 GB used on your phone (depending on total storage).\nIf you are trying to update many apps at once, or a very large app (there are some in the gigabytes), you need enough storage on your phone, and deleting a few small apps may not be enough. Try deleting apps that use more space and try updating just one or two individual apps that are small (in the Updates page of App Store it says the file size for the app updates) and see if you're still getting an error.\n", "Q: What's the easy way to convert all man pages to html? Sixteen years into the 21st century I remain baffled that we still have to go out of our way if we want to see a man page\n\n\n*\n\n*rendered in a proportional font (that is, not Courier or similar)\n\n*with links to other referenced pages\n\n\nThere are tantalizing web sites with HTML man pages that have links, like this, but I haven't found such a site with pages updated for the current version of macOS. And of course a web site won't show man pages for software you've installed via Homebrew, etc.\nIs there a solution to this problem? I've looked and looked. This\nfunction manp {\n  man -t \"$1\" | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app/\n}\n\nrenders a page and shows it in Preview (after you wait for a PostScript interpreter to convert it to PDF), but you don't get live links.\nThe man page for man says:\n\nHTML PAGES\nMan will find HTML pages if they live in directories named as expected to be \".html\", thus a valid name for an HTML version of the ls(1) man page would be /usr/share/man/htmlman1/ls.1.html.\n\nI could write a script to convert all of the man pages everywhere on my system to HTML, but I bet someone has already done this. And I bet they have also solved the problem of rendering SEE ALSO references as links, which the man command apparently doesn't do.\n\nA: Install Bwana which allows you to browse the man pages in your favourite browser.\nTo quote the page above \"Just type \"man:\" followed by the man page you're looking for into your browser's URL field. Hit enter and let Bwana do the rest.\" It has live links.\n\nA: bcat lets you pipe stdout to your default browser. An alternative to your Preview function would be:\nbman () \n{ \n    : Display man page in default browser\n    man $* | col -b | bcat\n}\n\n...or simply set man's pager:\nexport MANPAGER='col -b | bcat'\nman grep\n\nbcat works with any command that writes to stdout:\npbpaste  | bcat\nmake test | bcat\ntail -n 1000 -f /var/log/messages | bcat\n\n...etc.\nIt's a ruby-gem, so installation is as easy as:\ngem install bcat\n\nIf \"on the fly\" conversion isn't sufficient, and you want to produce HTML all at once, or in advance, this post on Unix.se has a number of suggestions (sadly one of my favourite tools, the mighty pandoc, won't work for this...)\n\nA: If you're already comfortable viewing man pages in the terminal environment with the man command, then !man some-other-command is a quick way to visit cross-referenced man pages. Really, ! is a feature of the pager, less, and can be used to run any arbitrary shell command, then come right back to where you were.\nSo maybe you don't even need anything I'm about to mention below.\n\nThat said, if you want a clickety-clickety interface to the man pages on your system, then Bwana or Dash are the way to go on a Mac. Bwana has a slight edge because it actually caches the rendered man page and Dash doesn't appear to. Dash is also paid and closed-source, which you might consider a downside.\nBwana still works fine for me on Catalina, no muss, no fuss. Your mileage may vary with later versions of macOS, but the source is available, so I believe it will have a long life. The way it works—by installing a URL handler for man: links—is pretty clever, too. This means you can type, for example, man:find in the location bar of whatever browser you already use, or open man:find in Terminal.\nI like to add the following userstyle to URLs generated by Bwana, so the content is centered in the window:\n@-moz-document regexp(\"file:.+Caches/Bwana/.*(?<!manindex-).html\") {\nbody {\n  max-width: 80ch;\n  margin-left: auto;\n  margin-right: auto;\n}\n}\n\n\nSeveral other timeworn solutions exist which will work in a generic Unix environment, and that includes Mac. These may require you to set up a web server, though, because something has to respond when you click those links in the SEE ALSO section, after all.\nThere is even a project called manservant which wraps the Perl man2html in a small Ruby web application, solving the web server issue for you. Of the other ones mentioned here, this has the most pleasing visual style. You should be able to get this working without much trouble, just using the Ruby that comes with macOS, at least up to and including Catalina.\n\n", "Q: How do I get Siri to call Amy instead of Aimee?

By this point, the bottom of my Finder windows say:\n\n15.78 GB available on iCloud, uploading 156,106 items (543.2 MB of 543.2 MB)\n\nHowever the files are never actually uploaded. I keep my screenshots folder on my desktop and I take a lot of screenshots, so I can see that September 7 was the last date any file was actually uploaded.\nWhat should I do? Is there a way I can disable and re-enable the feature without risking loss of data? Are there any solutions to this problem? What should I try? So far I've tried rebooting, and tried software update to macOS 10.12.2 public beta.\n\nA: Happened to me as well, here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up all items in the Documents and Desktop folders\n\n*Open up System Preferences\n\n*Click on iCloud\n\n*Click on Options next to iCloud Drive\n\n*If Desktop and Document Folders is disabled, enable it\n\n*If it enabled, un-enable it.\n\n*Uncheck the Optimize Mac Storage and click Done\n\n*Redo the opposite of this to re-enable iCloud\n\n*Move all Documents and Desktop items back to their respective area.\n\n\nIt is helpful to note if you are experiencing sync issues in any of the other categories in iCloud Drive, try disabling them and then re-enabling them.\n\nA: do not forget that osx is based on unix. what helped me is changing of 'bird' process priority ('bird' process is responsible for icloud replication).\n\n*\n\n*Double click on ☁️ iCloud icon in finder to see progress.\n\n\n\n\n*Go to Terminal\n\n\n*ps aux | grep bird.\nYou will see your bird process id, in my case it is 815.\nserg               815  98.8  0.8  4542828 137776   ??

I cannot guarantee it will work always, as iCloud is blackbox. Unfortunately i.e. mac has a unix core, but all above it is blackbox proprietary software\n\n\nA: I saw this comment in one of the threads here and it worked for me:\n\"I found killall bird can reset the upload and then my stuck is resolved\" – @zhangciwu\n\nA: This worked for me:\nIn Finder, use keyboard shortcut Shift + Command + G and type in “~/Library/Application Support/”, there’s a folder called CloudDocs. Chances are this is the culprit. Delete it (or move it elsewhere) and iCloud will reset itself and stop looping and re-caching the same files over and over again.\nSource: https://sleonproductions.com/how-to-fix-icloud-drive-stuck-at-uploading-in-mac/\n\nA: Have you changed the date and time on your computer or phone? This is a possible explanation of why iCloud is not syncing.\n\nA: Be careful, this method will Delete the files. Managed to solve it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Select iCloud\n\n*Untick iCloud\n\n*At the prompt select Remove from Mac\n\n*At the next prompt select Stop Updating and turn off\nShould be fixed, worked for me, really annoying\nSecond scenario that worked, on iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*iCloud Drive\n\n*Manage Storage\n\n*Click on the folder that's at fault and remove it from iCloud\n\n\nA: You can try the following command from the console.\nIt will recursively traverse your directory while updating the last modified date of each file. It will do this for all files but \"*.icloud\". The command will also print the name of each updated file.\ngo to the iCloud directory,\ncd $HOME/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs\n\n\nPlease: double check that you are in the directory above. Use pwd\n\nand trigger the date update for those files\nfind . ! -path \"*.icloud\" \\( -exec echo {} \\; -a -exec touch {} \\; \\)\n\n\nA: If you turn off iCloud as suggested, you have the option to save all our files to the local disk - but that only works if your local disk is big enough!\nWhen you turn back on again it re-syncs EVERYTHING, so could take several days and creates problems if your disk is not big enough to accommodate all your iCloud data TWICE — the backup and the re-synched version.\nIf, like me, you keep all documents, photos etc. on your iCloud, that is a massive effort! I did it once, but had to do it in steps as I did not have room for everything; you then have to check with a comparison program that you have not lost anything - big risk of data loss.\nIn the end I did not trust this, so ordered a Backblaze restore of everything from the last time I knew it was working and retired from there. I was relieved that I had a Backblaze backup. Remember that for non-apple programs the iCloud is known as /Users/username/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs\n\nA: Further to user9869932 above about resetting the date.\nNote it should be \ncd \"/Users/-your user name-/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs\"\nthen doing the command\nfind . ! -path \"*.icloud\" ( -exec echo {} \\; -a -exec touch {} \\; )\nWill give you a massive list - in my case - of files it resets the date on that are waiting to upload. The files then begin to upload. Check this by double-clicking on the little Pie icon in the Finder window. This brings up the progress bar. Your files will go up in batches, determined by whatever throttling Apple has set for the process. Mine went from over 4000 items to 1,175 in a few minutes but now seems stuck again.\nNow I notice that the list of update files includes files in Trash and other places where the files no longer exist. \nSo I'm suspecting that the iCloud sync process is not handling this well. Deleted and moved files are hanging about in the 'com~apple~CloudDocs' folder even when removed from their original locations.\nSo now instead of having just a few files not uploaded, I seem to have 1,175 items waiting to upload - which probably never will.\n", "Q: Mac admin account deleted -- have I lost my files? I got a new computer and gave my old one to my wife. Before I had a chance to save some files she deleted my admin account and set up one for herself.\nHow do I get my old files off the computer? \n\nA: There are a few options given when deleting an account on a Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the home folder as a disk image: This will archive all the\nuser’s documents and information so the user can be restored later if\nneeded. The disk    image is saved in /Users/Deleted Users/.\n\n*Leave the user’s home folder as is: Select “Don’t change the home\nfolder.” The user’s documents and information remain and the user can\nbe restored later if needed.

Here the internal keyboard and trackpad worked 100% of the time. \nThat is until I erased the drive. Now only external input devices work at all (even in Recovery).\nI even tried Internet Recovery so now I have a freshly installed Yosemite on a erased drive. The keyboard light is working and the trackpad clicks. But Yosemite doesn't detect them at all (Bluetooth Assistant starts since no keyboard/mouse is detected).\nCan I somehow check if the driver(?) is installed correctly. Can I totally wipe my Laptop ( Drive, Recovery Partition UEFI)? And would that help? \nCould it be a hardware error, even though it worked 100% at some point in Recovery Mode? At some point I noticed that the keys would work if i pressed them for a long time, but as of now this isn't the case.\n\nA: To close this up: \nI went to an Apple Store had the logic board replaced. Afterwards, I reinstalled from a backup and everything seemed fine... \nBut yesterday I noticed that I forgot to re-enable disk encryption (using File Vault). After enabling it and rebooting I got the exact same problem again. This time I also experienced the problem described here: Password incorrect after enabling FileVault\nBut unlike last time the problem disappeared (so far) after disabling encryption again. \nIf you wind up here looking for answers: Try disabling File Vault and check this for more details: MacBook startup problems - mouse and keyboard not working at login / stuck on apple logo\n", "Q: What does serverperfmode=1 actually do on macOS? Turning it on is described here but there are no details.\nThere is a vague description:\n\nPerformance mode changes the system parameters of your Mac. These\n  changes take better advantage of your hardware for demanding server\n  applications.\n\nWhat is actually changing inside the system/kernel?\n\nA: Turning on Server Performance Mode essentially increases some kernel/net parameters related to the max number of possible/allowed processes and connections and modifies some memory/timer settings:\n...\nkern.maxvnodes: 66560 > 300000\nkern.maxproc: 1064 > 5000\n...\nkern.maxfilesperproc: 10240 > 150000\nkern.maxprocperuid: 709 > 3750\nkern.ipc.maxsockbuf: 4194304 > 8388608\n...\nkern.ipc.somaxconn: 128 > 1024\n...\nkern.ipc.nmbclusters: 32768 > 65536\n...\nkern.ipc.sbmb_cnt_peak: 1120 > 1170\n...\nkern.ipc.njcl: 10920 > 21840\n...\nkern.timer.longterm.qlen: 100 > 0\nkern.timer.longterm.threshold: 1000 > 0\n...\nnet.inet.ip.maxfragpackets: 1024 > 2048\n...\nnet.inet.tcp.tcbhashsize: 4096 > 8192\n...\nnet.inet.tcp.fastopen_backlog: 10 > 200\n...\nnet.inet6.ip6.maxfragpackets: 1024 > 2048\n...\nnet.inet6.ip6.maxfrags: 2048 > 4096\n#and some very special vm page-outs/compressor and and memory/cache settings\n\nThe goal is to allow more open files (especially needed for web servers) and connections to serve more clients at the same time and discarding single server threads faster from memory/virtual memory (if I interpret certain modifications correctly).\n\nIn the past, Apple released a different OS and now that server loads on top of the consumer OS some basic tuning can help the operating system run processes for 25 users that connect to a server instead of being tuned for one person using the OS. These tunings are just a starting point - anyone that wants their server to perform under high load needs to customize and monitor things at a far more detailed level than having performance mode on or off.\nAlso, these limits are mostly for preventing bad software from bringing down a server by exhausting limited resources like inter process communications signaling channels (ipc). On a system where one user is running, you want to halt a runaway process sooner than if there are dozens of processes running for dozens of users. The \"performance\" can be seen as raising some hard limits as opposed to \"serve one file or one web page faster\".\n\nA: Server Performance Mode (a.k.a. perfmode or serverperfmode) changes a number of kernel parameters, reserving a lot more memory for the kernel in order to provide a lot higher limits and thus enable a lot more processes to run, files to be open, and network connections to be handled, among other things. All of the parameters scale with the amount of memory installed, within limits, and nothing changes unless you have at least 16 GiB of memory installed. @klanomath's numbers correspond to having 16 GiB of memory installed.\nHere is a brief description from an old support document from Apple about Server 10.6:\n\n\n*\n\n*For each 8GB of installed memory, 2500 processes and 150,000 vnodes\nare available.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The maximum number of threads is set to five times\n(5x) the number of maximum processes. (This seem no longer to be true)\n\n*A single user ID (uid) can use\nup to 75% of the maximum number of processes.\n\n*A single process can\nallocate up to 20% of the maximum threads value.\n\nUnder performance mode with 48 GiB of memory, I see:\nkern.maxvnodes: 900000\nkern.maxproc: 15000\nkern.maxprocperuid: 11250\nkern.num_tasks: 15000\nkern.num_taskthreads: 15000\nkern.num_threads: 75000\nkern.maxfiles: 900000\nkern.maxfilesperproc: 450000\n\nkern.ipc.maxsockbuf:8388608\nkern.ipc.somaxconn: 2048\nkern.ipc.nmbclusters: 131072\nkern.ipc.sbmb_cnt_peak: # This parameter is not in my kernel\nkern.ipc.njcl: 43688\n...\nkern.timer.longterm.qlen: 0 # same\nkern.timer.longterm.threshold: 0 # same\n...\nnet.inet.ip.maxfragpackets: 4096\n...\nnet.inet.tcp.tcbhashsize: 32768\nnet.inet.tcp.fastopen_backlog: 600\n...\nnet.inet6.ip6.maxfragpackets: 4096\nnet.inet6.ip6.maxfrags: 8192\n\nIf you really want to dig into it, you can read the actual code. Below is from El Capitan 10.11.6. Server mode is still the same (up to the most recently published code, which is from OS X 10.14 Mojave), but normal mode got a performance bump starting in OS X 10.13 High Sierra if you have at least 12 GiB of memory (changes included in comments in the code).\nThe scale_seutp function sets up the scale factor as floor(memsize / 8 GiB) if you have Server Performance Mode enabled and at least 16 GiB of memory installed. Otherwise it is zero unless you have at least 3 GiB of memory, in which case it is 2, or, starting with High Sierra, memsize / 4 GiB. (The value of task_max at the beginning of the code snippet is set when the kernel is built, and it is unclear how it gets set by Apple when distributing OS X. It's probably 1024.)\n    typeof(task_max) task_max_base = task_max;\n\n    /* Raise limits for servers with >= 16G */\n    if ((serverperfmode != 0) && ((uint64_t)sane_size >= (uint64_t)(16 * 1024 * 1024 *1024ULL))) {\n        scale = (int)((uint64_t)sane_size / (uint64_t)(8 * 1024 * 1024 *1024ULL));\n        /* limit to 128 G */\n        if (scale > 16)\n            scale = 16;\n        task_max_base = 2500;\n    } else if ((uint64_t)sane_size >= (uint64_t)(3 * 1024 * 1024 *1024ULL))\n        scale = 2;\n    /* Starting with OS X 10.13 High Sierra, if more than 8 GiB of memory,\n     * scale = sane_size / 4 GiB with max of 16 (64 GiB or more)\n     */\n\n    task_max = MAX(task_max, task_max_base * scale);\n\n    if (scale != 0) {\n        task_threadmax = task_max;\n        thread_max = task_max * 5; \n    }\n\nSide note: Notice that in the above scale_setup is that the scale factor for serverperfmode is the system memory divided by 8 GiB, while for regular mode it is system memory divided by 4 GiB. So a computer with 32 GiB of memory will have twice the scale factor in normal mode as in performance mode, making it even less likely that you will want to use serverperfmode on a machine with a lot of memory.\nThe scale factor is applied in bsd_scale_setup (only for a 64-bit kernel) or here for High Sierra. This modifies the kernel parameters that are discussed above and are visible via sysctl. Note that if Server Performance Mode is not enabled, the only thing that is scaled is maxproc (532 -> 1064) and maxprocperuid (266 -> 709) until High Sierra, when maxfiles and maxfilesperproc are also bumped if you have at least 12 GiB of memory. That said, the other parameters scaled in serverperfmode are mainly about handling large numbers of network connection requests, something you are unlikely to need unless you are running a real web server with a very high load.\n    /* The initial value of maxproc here is 532 */\n    if ((scale > 0) && (serverperfmode == 0)) {\n        maxproc *= scale;\n        maxprocperuid = (maxproc * 2) / 3;\n        /* Starting with OS X 10.13 High Sierra, this clause is added\n        if (scale > 2) {\n            maxfiles *= scale;\n            maxfilesperproc = maxfiles/2;\n        }\n        *** end of High Sierra addition */\n    }\n    /* Apply server scaling rules */\n    if ((scale >  0) && (serverperfmode !=0)) {\n        maxproc = 2500 * scale;\n        hard_maxproc = maxproc;\n        /* no fp usage */\n        maxprocperuid = (maxproc*3)/4;\n        maxfiles = (150000 * scale);\n        maxfilesperproc = maxfiles/2;\n        desiredvnodes = maxfiles;\n        vnodes_sized = 1;\n        tcp_tfo_backlog = 100 * scale;\n        if (scale > 4) {\n            /* clip somaxconn at 32G level */\n            somaxconn = 2048;\n            /*\n             * For scale > 4 (> 32G), clip\n             * tcp_tcbhashsize to 32K\n             */\n            tcp_tcbhashsize = 32 *1024;\n\n            if (scale > 7) {\n                /* clip at 64G level */\n                max_cached_sock_count = 165000;\n            } else {\n                max_cached_sock_count = 60000 + ((scale-1) * 15000);\n            }\n        } else {\n            somaxconn = 512*scale;\n            tcp_tcbhashsize = 4*1024*scale;\n            max_cached_sock_count = 60000 + ((scale-1) * 15000);\n        }\n    }\n\nFinally, the scale factor is also applied in bsd_exec_setup. This configures how much kernel memory is reserved for assembling all the data needed to initialize a process. How a process is exec'd is worthy of a full chapter in a book on the Unix kernel so I won't go into it here. The high-level consequence of this setting is that a bigger number takes up more memory, but allows a larger number of processes to be created per second. (Although this code has stayed the same through the present/Mojave, the effect changed with the change in how scale is computed in High Sierra. Recall the details above: in High Sierra and later, scale is roughly (memory / 4 GiB) for normal mode and (memory / 8 GiB) for server mode. So bsd_simul_execs can actually go down when you switch to server mode.)\n    switch (scale) {\n        case 0:\n        case 1:\n            bsd_simul_execs = BSD_SIMUL_EXECS;\n            break;\n        case 2:\n        case 3:\n            bsd_simul_execs = 65;\n            break;\n        case 4:\n        case 5:\n            bsd_simul_execs = 129;\n            break;\n        case 6:\n        case 7:\n            bsd_simul_execs = 257;\n            break;\n        default:\n            bsd_simul_execs = 513;\n            break;\n            \n    }\n    bsd_pageable_map_size = (bsd_simul_execs * BSD_PAGEABLE_SIZE_PER_EXEC);\n\nFor El Capitan through the present/Mojave, BSD_PAGEABLE_SIZE_PER_EXEC = 264 * 1024, so for my 48 GiB Mac the kernel will reserve about 67 MiB of memory just as buffer space for setting up new processes to be spawned. On the one hand, that is a crazy high number, even for a web server. On the other hand, 67 MiB is peanuts compared to the 48 GiB on the machine.\nSo Server Performance Mode does take up more memory, and makes the system much more likely to suffer if some program goes out of control consuming resources, but greatly increases the capability of the system to handle a lot more background tasks. I think Apple made the right call by not turning it on by default but also making it easy to enable. I am glad that with High Sierra they are now raising limits in normal mode if you have enough memory. I would leave server mode off (and have left it off) on all my computers until I notice them running into issues because I have so many server programs running on it. After all, it does not speed up the system clock, it does not increase disk speed, and it only increases network I/O if you have hundreds of connections. There's a decent chance your firewall/router will have problems keeping up if you get to the point where server mode has a real impact on your network throughput.\nOn the other hand, if you really have a need to run 2000 processes, server mode is your only option until you get to High Sierra. The good news is that it is easy enough to turn on, try out, and if you don't like it, turn back off.\n", "Q: Is there free real time app to protect my Mac that are not dangerous for Mac or its user? Do following real time protection apps for Mac harm Mac technologically or spy after the user?\nAVAST, Avira, Sophos, AVG\n\nA: Yes - all of the listed apps harm usability and make Mac OS less secure and less performant in my opinion. Spy on the user is a little vague, so you'd want to examine one product specifically and their data retention / collection / implementation to get a meaningful answer.\nI would say you should use Apple's gatekeeper and only run signed / MAS apps if you are thinking free protection is worth your effort or time. You pay Apple for hardware so it's clear why they protect you. If you aren't paying for software, someone else is paying for your data or benefiting so without a compelling reason why you trust that person, my initial reaction is to be overly suspicious of that \"free lunch\".\n", "Q: Does Spotlight index content that resides only on iCloud Drive after local storage is purged? I want to use iCloud Drive to sync the Documents folder. When I run out of disk space macOS will free up space by removing old content on my SDD.\nMy question is, will that also remove Spotlight's knowledge (that is the meta data) of these files?\n\nA: Yes Spotlight is indexing iCloud Drive. It could take a while before your iCloud Drive is indexed.\nSpotlight even shows if the file you are looking for is located in iCloud Drive.\nTo test if the metadata is still working after the file is purged I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Added test333 in the file comments \n\n*Moved it to iCloud Drive\n\n*Occupied a lot of space with an empty disk image\n\n*The system purged the file\n\n*Searched for the comment\n\n\n\n\nA: No metadata index is only searchable when iCloud documents are purged or not stored locally. A file only gets indexed when it’s written through the local filesystem and the metadata index gets updated. \nSpotlight only indexes a local drive in my testing of 10.12.2 so I would expect you to lose the spotlight search data for any files that initially are downloaded to your Mac but then get purged in a low disk space pruning of the local cache of files.\nThere are mechanisms for macOS to maintain a spotlight index from a remote network volume and it also is conceivable Apple could engineer a solution where the spotlight metadata is kept locally when the prune occurs. I just can't verify that the implementation is performed or complete.\nIf I am able to get a test case, I will edit this answer with details but the work to set that up for me are more hassle than my curiosity at the moment. It would be fairly easy to set this up if you bumped your storage to 50 GB for one month and installed macOS with a boot drive less than 50 GB.\n", "Q: Assemble an Array of Macs to shudown via ssh?

Unfortunately in some cases this process seems to be hindered by some bug with FileVault 2 setups that prevents their systems from immediately unlocking and loading the OS, so their systems now take up to several minutes to log in, or fail to log in as in my case.\nSolution 1 - If your OS loads for a long time\nEnsure you have a full backup of your Mac using Time Machine.\n\n*\n\n*Go to FileVault tab in the Security & Privacy system preferences and turn off FileVault.\n\n\n*When FileVault is disabled and your drive is decrypted, restart your Mac.\n\n\n*Hold the Command-R keys down at the boot chimes to load your Mac into Recovery Mode.\n\n\n*Open Disk Utility and use it to run a Repair Disk routine, available in the First Aid tab when you select your hard drive. Do this for both the hard drive device, and your boot volume.\n\n\n*Restart your Mac normally and log in.\n\n\n*Re-enable FileVault in the Security & Privacy system preferences.\nSolution 2 - If you can't login and stuck watching progress bar loading forever\nThe above routine works for if you can eventually boot your Mac in the face of this bug, but if you cannot log in and see the system hang on the loading progress bar for hours with no ability to use your system, then you will have to use another procedure:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your system and hold the Command-R keys at the startup chimes to load into Recovery Mode.\n\n\n*Use Disk Utility to turn off encryption on your boot drive. If this gives you errors, then reboot in Target Disk Mode (hold the T key at the boot chimes) and use Disk Utility on another Mac via a Thunderbolt or Firewire cable to turn off encryption.

By specifying /usr/bin/env /path/to/file.sh in the launch agent's plist you force to run the file with the shell determined by the variable SHELL which usually is bash on macOS. Instead, just provide the file path, /path/to/file.sh and the shebang will cause zsh to be used automatically.\n\nA: #!/bin/zsh\n\nThe following line above is meant to be run in zsh, not bash.\nto make it run in bash, it has to be\n#!/bin/bash.\nHow do I run in zsh?\nIf you have run bash, you can change that by running zsh in the bash terminal.\n", "Q: How to reset ACLs after Apple Server sharing mistake? I wanted to share my root file system and in Server.app I set up / as a share.

I've got an iMac as my main computer and just bought a MacBook for while I'm travelling or visiting clients. I'm using Dropbox to keep my files in sync. But I've thinking about taking a step further and keep everything in sync, including Application, users preferences (everything in /Library/Preferences, /Users/user/Library/Preferences, /Library/Application Support and /Users/user/Library/Application Support) as well as Applications and everything in the command line (including home-brew install, packages, etc. \nPlease note that I do know how to keep Applications and User Preferences in sync (ln -s /source/dir/ /Users/user/Dropbox/whatevername) but would like to know if its advisable to also sync Applications and command line settings/packages (which I have no idea of how to do it).\nCould you please provide suggestions? Thanks in advance\n\nA: There are a number of ways to achieve this and probably twice as many traps. That said, I've had a lot of success using Mackup. It can backup your dot files, plist files, is customizable and can integrate with several cloud storage services or a local file server. I run this hourly as a cron job to make sure I'm always backing up. This works well on settings but not apps. You can find this at https://github.com/lra/mackup\nYou could also use Homebrew as a way of \"synching\" your applications. brew list > souceAppList on your iMac will list the applications installedthere. You could do the same on your MacBook and grep the difference to see what is missing. Something like:\ntargetApps=\"$(brew list)\" \nfor checkThisApp in $(cat /some/path/to/sourceAppList); do\n  if [[ \"$checkThisApp\" != \"$(echo \"$targetApps\"|grep -o $checkThisApp)\" ]]; then\n    echo \"$appCheck is not installed on this computer\"  # to notify an app is missing\n    brew install \"$appCheck\"                            # to force the app install\n  fi\ndone\n\n", "Q: My terminal prompt has a weird, unfamiliar name in it. \nWhat's up with that? Breezy's iPhone?\nThis is the beginning of all my terminal prompts.\n\nA: First, I'd check what WiFi access point your Mac is connected to.\nOne explanation for your screenshot is that your MacBook is acquiring (or has recently acquired) its IP address from a DHCP server on the device called Breezys-iPhone. That's most likely to happen if that iPhone is acting as a tethered hotspot, and your Mac is connecting to it rather than your usual WiFi access point.\nYou can find additional information about the hostname shown in the terminal prompt in the answers to this question.\n", "Q: Synchronize two working external drives over network We have two designers both using iMacs, running macOS Sierra; each have their own 4TB USB hdd. The designers have to transfer files to each other frequently over AirDrop but this is tedious.  \nWhat would be the best way to have the drives automatically sync files on both drives?\nWe've done some searching but most of the scenarios are only one working drive syncing to a back up. In our case both drives are being used and files are being created and edited on each.  Essentially I would like something like a synchronized ftp or a remote source control, something that automatically updates files that are changed on either drive and creates/deletes files.  Bonus points for adding a third external into the mix that is used just to have a offline backup of all files.  \n\nA: This ServerFault entry asks a similar question. The answers there are rsync and a product called Unison. It sounds like either solution fits the problem you have in front of you.\n\n\n*\n\n*For rsync, something like the following recipe would likely work (I haven't run this, so the syntax may need some fiddling):\n# sync drive.2 to drive.1\nrsync -av --stats <user>@computer.2:/path/to/drive.2 /path/to/drive.1/\n\n# sync drive.1 to drive.2\nrsync -av --stats <user>@computer.1:/path/to/drive.1 /path/to/drive.2/\n\n\n*And Unison, the other option from the ServerFault entry, looks like it's a software package designed specifically to solve your type of synchronization problem.\n\nA: Syncthing is an open-source solution to synchronise files across networks.\nIt synchronises files either way, you can add as many nodes as you like, it allows you to keep version history in case some changes get overwritten.\nIt works in background, offers a web management interface, and handles well situations in which you disconnect one or more drives.\nYou can install with Homebrew:\nbrew install syncthing\n\nBy default it enables the client interface at the address http://127.0.0.1:8384:\n\n\nA: Edit for at least Mojave and later - file sharing, caching, and being a Time Machine remote destination are now all possible without needing the Server.app software from apple, all within the \"Sharing\" preferences within System Preferences.\nThis doesn't directly answer the question as posed, but might be a different way of getting the results you want. If you install macOS Server from Apple onto one (or both) of the iMacs you could use file sharing to just share a folder to both users, and not worry about the synchronization at all. Gig ethernet makes for pretty reasonable file transfer speeds.\nhttp://www.apple.com/macos/server/\nYou could then also use the TimeMachine function of the server software to provide for an additional backup destination for the iMacs, and the caching feature to speed up any update/iCloud/Apple traffic on your network.

However I'm on a new network and when my mediaplayer is scanning for network drives it will not find the share. Manually entering the IP and folder does not give any results either. \nHow can I check whether the NFS server is running and what is blocking access?\n\nA: You can check if the server is running in NFS Manager itself:\nHit the Test Server button in NFS Manager:\n\nEnter the IP of the server (either 127.0.0.1 or the interface IP e.g. 192.168.0.5) and hit \"Test\".\n\nIf the NFS server is running you get the following result:\n\nSome of the ports depend on your configuration.

In order to achieve this I created a new key mapping where Command+Delete maps to Send hex codes: 0x15.\nCould someone point me to the source where it is explained what sending hex code actually achieves.\n\nA: It just sends the corresponding bytes to the shell. Same thing as \"send escape sequence\" but with different notation - the raw data otherwise represented by symbols and characters. It's then up to the shell to interpret this (usually through readline and .inputrc bindings, or equivalent) into commands. \nIn your specific example, 0x15 means Ctrl+U, the standard binding for backward-kill-line.

I even tried a programmable remote (a Harmony), which offers more buttons/commands than the Apple remote, but none of them seem to offer a Skip/Next function during music videos.\n", "Q: iOS app with subscription on remote server First of all, I'm uncertain if this is a question for AskDifferent. If not, please point me to the correct section.\nI have a website that features paid subscription based content. I would like to create an iOS app in which users login and have access to the app's functionality only if their subscription on the website is valid.\nIs this something that is allowed as per Apples app guidelines? I've heard rumors that it's not, but wasn't able to find anything regarding this specific scenario.\nThanks\n\nA: Yes this is allowed. However you are required to let users sign up through the iOS app. You get 85% and Apple gets 15%.\n\n3.1.3 Content-based “Reader” Apps\nApps may allow a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically:\nmagazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video, access to\nprofessional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and approved services\nsuch as educational apps that manage student grades and schedules),\nprovided the app does not direct users to a purchasing mechanism other\nthan IAP.\n3.1.4 Content Codes\nApps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, etc. In limited circumstances, such as when features are dependent upon specific hardware to function, the app may unlock that functionality without using in-app purchase (e.g. an astronomy app that adds features when synced with a telescope).\n\nSource: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#content-based-reader-apps\n", "Q: Apple Watch won't unlock MacBook Pro unless watch is restarted My issue is unlocking my Mac with the Apple Watch feature.\nI've read where turning off the watch and phone will then in turn allow me to unlock my Mac.  This works, the problem is, I have to do this every single day.  Since enabling this feature, I haven't gone two days in a row without having to restart my watch/phone to be able to use this feature.  Once I do this, the feature works great all day.  But it's very frustrating to have to do this on a daily basis.\nNote: I turn my Mac off at night and turn in on in the morning at work.\nAnyone else having this same problem, or know of a fix?\nApple Watch OS: 3.1(14S471) 1st Gen watch\niPhone OS: 10.2(14C92) iPhone 5s\nMacbook Pro OS: macOS Sierra 10.12.1 15-inch late 2013\n\nA: This appears to have been fixed in macOS 10.12.2.\nFrom Apples release notes:\nImproves setup and reliability of Auto Unlock.\nToday was the first day I haven't had to restart my phone and watch!\n", "Q: Does Reset and \"Erase All Content and Settings\" removes iOS updates? I want to reset and clear the iPad. \nBut I would like to keep the iOS updates.\n\n\nA: No. Factory resetting your phone only deletes the user data; the operating system and firmware will still remain the same.\nThat means, if your iPhone is running iOS 9.3.2 before you reset with Erase all content and settings, it will be running iOS 9.3.2 (minus all of your data) once it starts up again.\n\nA: You cannot revert the operating system. As a result, you are free to remove all content and settings and the iOS version will remain the same. Resetting all settings will also not impact the operating system.\n", "Q: Recover SSH private key passphrase from keychain After performing a macOS upgrade ssh asked for my ssh passphrase. I have completely forgotten the passphrase since keychain has been managing it.\nThis answer shows how to configure keychain to reconnect and remove my need to enter the passphrase when connecting to a host. After following those steps I can ssh successfully without knowing the private key passphrase, which suggests that the passphrase is stored in keychain.\nHowever, I can't find the ssh passphrase in keychain. Is there a way to recover the ssh key passphrase from keychain?\nThis question/answer says that keychain keeps passphrases as regular keychain items, but I can only find one item after searching for ssh and that is an older item for my original id_rsa key which is no longer is use.\n\nA: Short answer: Yes, choose \"Show Invisible Items\" in Keychain Access\n(Originally, this answer incorrectly said: \"There doesn't currently seem to be a way to recover the passphrase.\" The rest of the answer comparing how SSH key passphrases are stored in keychains on older and newer versions of macOS is kept here for reference.)\nIn Mac OS X 10.11 and earlier, SSH key passphrases were stored by ssh and ssh-add in the user's login keychain, using the following properties (pseudocode adapted from Apple OpenSSH-195.40.1):\n{\n    kSecClass: kSecClassGenericPassword,\n    kSecAttrAccount: pathToPrivateKey,\n    kSecAttrLabel: \"SSH: \" + pathToPrivateKey,\n    kSecAttrService: \"SSH\"\n}\n\nAs of macOS 10.12, the passphrase is queried and stored with properties that force it to be stored in the \"syncable\" keychain (the database-backed \"Local Items\", also called \"iCloud Keychain\" if that is enabled), with access controlled by an \"Access Group\"; ssh will ignore the old items in your login keychain.\nFrom Apple OpenSSH 209:\n{\n    kSecClass: kSecClassGenericPassword,\n    kSecAttrAccount: pathToPrivateKey,\n    kSecAttrLabel: \"SSH: \" + pathToPrivateKey,\n    kSecAttrService: \"OpenSSH\",\n    kSecAttrNoLegacy: TRUE,\n    kSecAttrAccessGroup: \"com.apple.ssh.passphrases\"\n}\n\nApple has not enabled the security command-line tool to access the contents of the syncable keychain, and by default (unless you select \"Show Invisible Items\") Keychain Access doesn't show the complete contents of it either, even though the ssh keychain item is not explicitly marked as invisible.\nIf you wanted to try to obtain the password without using Keychain Access, I don't think it would be straightforward or maybe even possible to write a program that fetches the passphrase from the keychain, since access to it is controlled by Apple's code signing.\nYou can see some limited details about the passphrases stored in your syncable keychain using the sqlite3 command, but most of the interesting fields like the item labels are encrypted.\n$ sqlite3 Library/Keychains/*/keychain-2.db \"select rowid, datetime(mdat+978307200, 'unixepoch', 'localtime'), agrp from genp where agrp = 'com.apple.ssh.passphrases' order by mdat asc\"  \n45|2017-01-07 13:53:13|com.apple.ssh.passphrases\n46|2017-01-08 23:59:25|com.apple.ssh.passphrases\n\n\nA: MacOS 10.13.3:\nOpen Keychain Access and enable the option View > Show Invisible Items.\nThen you must search for id_rsa or ‘ssh’.\nClick to reveal passhrase. You may need to provide your Mac login password at that point.\n\nA: Open Keychain Access and enable the option View > Show Invisible Items.\nThan you must search for id_rsa or ‘ssh’.\n", "Q: Can I sign in with one Apple ID for the App Store and a different ID for Apple Music? I basically want to sign in with a US Apple ID for the App Store and an Indian ID for Apple Music.\nIs it possible to do that without losing all the music saved using Apple Music?\nPlease let me know \n\nA: The \"Mac App Store\" accessed through \"App Store.app\" uses a totally seperate login system from iTunes.app, so you can use different AppleIDs for the two of them.\nWithin iTunes.app, I use multiple different AppleIDs to purchase iOS apps in different regions, which means I sometimes need to sign out of one AppleID and sign into a different one when switching regions and purchaseing or updating iOS apps. I have not encountered any issues when pushing these apps to my iOS devices or when running them on the iOS devices.\nThe Apple Music part is trickier.  According to http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/10/04/apple-music-foreign-japan-account-in-usa/ you cannot easily have multiple regions using multiple iCloud Music Libraries, swithching AppleIDs for this purpose is limited.\nAs I understand things: if you want to use a different AppleID to buy some iOS apps, this should not be a problem - your current setup will not be impacted. If you want to use a different AppleID to sign into Apple Music then you will loose access to your current AppleID Apple Music stuff until you switch back.\n\nA: No, Apple does not allow us to use different apple ids separately for app store and apple music, however you can use different apple ids for iCloud and app store.\n", "Q: Apple safari is crashing again and again My Safari browser is crashing again and again while I am working , this is the error that It prompts to send to apple overtime it crashes.\nProcess:               com.apple.Safari.SafeBrowsing.Service [773]\nPath:                  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SafariSafeBrowsing.framework/Versions/A/com.apple.Safari.SafeBrowsing.Service\nIdentifier:            com.apple.Safari.SafeBrowsing.Service\nVersion:               7602.1.50\nCode Type:             X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process:        ???

Even unchecking 1.8 doesn't persist -- it's rechecked on the next launch.\nHow does one go about selecting a particular Java version these days?\n\nA: Maybe just put the following in your ~/.bashrc:\nexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6`\n\n", "Q: Find my friends inaccurate location Is it possible for find my friends location to initially identify the correct location and then suddenly shift to an inaccurate location even if that person is still in his initial location? \nWhat happened was I was tracking my son on his way to school just to know if he got there safe and after a few minutes, FMF located him exactly where he should be (school), but after checking again, his location changed to a few streets away from where he should be. I tried to find out what that place was and it was a furniture store which is not even open yet. \nSo I'm wondering if it's possible for find my location to give off inaccurate information?\n\nA: Yea it's very inaccurate sometimes, believe me I got mad at my daughter because she told me she was at my sisters house but the gps was saying otherwise so I got upset at her but she was actually at her house.My sister confirm that, I had to apologize!\n", "Q: Restrict CL \"Find\" to Root Volume Only Because the default MacOS mount point for volumes is inside the root volume (i.e., /Volumes/…) find / -iname \"hidenseek\" searches every mounted volume, not just the root volume.\nHow can I restrict it to just the root volume?  \n\nA: The -x option will prevent find from descending into directories that have a different device number.\n find -x / ...expressions\n\n", "Q: Connect a Mac as an external drive to another Mac I run a 2008 Mac Pro and an old G5 Power Mac. Would it be possible to hook them together and use the G5 as an external drive mounted on the Mac Pro?\n\nA: Macs can boot into a “Target Disk Mode” that causes them to function like an external hard drive. Connect one Mac to another Mac and you can access its files in the Finder.\nBefore entering Target Disk Mode, you’ll need a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two Macs: Target Disk Mode works with Macs, so you’ll need two Macs for this. Each Mac needs either a Thunderbolt port or a Firewire port.\n\n*A Firewire or Thunderbolt Cable: You’ll need either a Firewire cable or a Thunderbolt cable for this. You can’t do this via a USB cable. If one Mac has a Thunderbolt port and the other Mac has a Firewire port, you’ll need a Thunderbolt-to-Firewire adapter cable.\n\n*FileVault Disabled: Macs now enable FileVault encryption by default, which will prevent you from accessing FileVault-encrypted home directories over Target Disk Mode.\n\n*No Firmware Password: If you’ve set a firmware password in the recovery environment, you’ll need to disable that first.\n\n\n \nHow to Enter Target Disk Mode\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your Macs via a Firewire or Thunderbolt cable.\n\n*Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. \n\n*Click the “Startup Disk” icon and click the Target Disk Mode button to restart your Mac in Target Disk Mode.\n\n*You can also enter Target Disk Mode by rebooting your Mac and holding down the T key as it boots. \n\n\n\n", "Q: How to make iCloud stop syncing documents without erasing from Mac? I've never turned on \"sync documents and desktop to iCloud\" but a friend says she never turned hers on but it's on.  When she tries to turn it off, the \"are you sure\" popup says that it will keep the documents on iCloud but delete them from the Mac.  That makes absolutely no sense!\nBut iCloud is full, so she can't save anything.  Being a college student, that is a serious problem.  And losing the documents, then having to log in to the web interface to get them back is equally ridiculous.  \nWhat is the easiest way to get the documents OFF of iCloud and keep them on the computer?  She doesn't have another computer to make the sync worthwhile.  She does have an iPhone but no one wants to write research papers on an iPhone.  (Especially someone who depends on VoiceOver)\nI know we could make a backup, and restore after the delete.  Or re-downlonad from the web interface.  But it's hard to believe Apple would make a process that user-hostile.\n\nA: The wording of the warning is misleading. If you turn off this syncing, the files will not be gone or deleted, but they will not be on your ~/Desktop or in your ~/Documents folders. They will be in your \"iCloud Drive\" folder, which is a folder on your computer that is synced to iCloud, but is still available on your computer. To get things \"back to normal\" you will just have to move the files from the \"iCloud Drive\" folder back to the ~/Desktop and ~/Documents folders.\nHere is how to clean things up:\nFirst go to Apple menu -> \"System Preferences\" -> iCloud\nIn iCloud preferences you should click the \"Options\" button beside the item \"iCloud Drive\" and if the \"Desktop & Documents Folders\" item is selected, then that is probably what is causing you to be using so much space on Apple's computers. If you uncheck this box, you can recover a lot of space from your iCloud storage, but it will take a few more steps for it to be \"back to normal\":\nGo to Apple Menu > System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive > \"Options\" and UNcheck the \"Desktop & Documents Folders\" checkbox. You’ll get a pop-up warning you that these files will only be stored in iCloud Drive if you disable Desktop and Documents syncing. Go ahead and click “Turn Off”.  Files on your desktop and in your Documents folder will seem to be removed but they are still within the \"iCloud Drive\" folder on your computer, which will automatically open after you click “Turn Off”, so these files aren’t actually disappearing and getting deleted, but are simply in iCloud Drive exclusively.\nNext, open up the iCloud Drive folder on your Mac and you’ll see two folders called “Desktop” and “Documents”. If you cannot find the \"iCloud Drive\" folder (it is likely listed in a Finder window's \"sidebar\" which can be displayed using the Finder menu item \"View\" -> \"Show Sidebar\" if the sidebar is hidden), you can have access to it by going to the Finder menu item \"Finder\" -> \"Preferences\" -> \"Sidebar\" and making sure the \"iCloud Drive\" item is checked. Alternatively you can use the Finder menu item \"Go\" -> \"iCloud Drive\" to open this folder.\nThe folder \"iCloud Drive\" is where your files are. You can now move the contents of \"iCloud Drive\"/Desktop and \"iCloud Drive\"/Documents back to your ~/Desktop and your ~/Documents folders.\nYou can leave the now empty “Desktop” and “Documents” folders in \"iCloud Drive\". If you delete them, they might get recreated automagically, so don't be surprised.\nThe following website has some pictures of the windows as well as some of the text I copied above:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/273629/how-to-restore-your-desktop-and-documents-after-disabling-icloud-sync-in-macos-sierra/\nHere is another reference about the issues:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/3098804/data-center-cloud/how-to-use-icloud-drive-s-new-desktop-and-documents-access-in-macos-sierra.html\n\nA: I have tried all solutions like the accepted one and it did not work for me. This worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory called, ~/myStuff\n\n*move ~/Documents and ~/Desktop to my stuff.\n\n*Turn iCloud sharing for Desktop and Documents.\n\n*Login to www.iCloud.com and delete Desktop and Documents from there. Do not forget to empty the recent deleted files there.\n\n*Now that your Desktop and Download folders are empty, iCloud will have to make iCloud empty.\n\n*Delete the local copy of Desktop and Downloads inside iCloud Drive on your mac.\n\n*Turn off sharing Desktop and Documents to iCloud.\n\nThis is the only way I have managed to stop that.\n", "Q: How to disable the discrete graphics card on a mid 2010 MacBook Pro on El Capitan? I have a mid-2010 MacBook Pro that suffers from the flawed Nvidia chip.\nUsing gfxCardStatus to force the use of integrated graphics works most of the time. But every once in a while Mail.app or some browser content (e.g. FB 360 videos) will force discrete mode and cause a GPU panic and subsequent reboot.\nI'm looking for a way to disable the discrete graphics so it always uses integrated.\nI found this and tried to follow most of the steps\nhttp://www.asyncro.com/2014/03/24/macbook-pro-discreate-graphics-card-issue-fix-updated/\nI had to boot into recovery mode first and use csrutil disable to disable the new system protection in El Capitan in order to move files.\nAnd I assumed I needed to move the GeForce*.* instead of AMD*.* files.\nBut the command to rebuild the kextcache isn't working in El Capitan.\n\nA: That is neither a permanent solution nor it disables discrete graphics card, you will end up with very slow graphics that make your computer unusable for everyday work.\nI answered this other question with the full procedure to permanently disable discrete graphics card on startup.\n\nA: Most owners of MBPs from 2010 with an apparently flawed NVidia dGPU should not seek to disable the GPU.\nWhile that circumvention is possible – either electrically, or with EFI/NVRAM hacking, or with moving the video driver kexts related to the NVidia-chip, it is by far not the best solution.\nOn most of these models it is not really the dGPU that is defective. It just appears like that because you notice the problems when the dGPU is 'switched on'. It is entirely possible that indeed the NVidia dGPU might be defective. But in reality it is most often only a tiny little capacitor that really has a flaw and interferes with power management of the dGPU. \nIf the capacitor is the problem, then one 'halfway' good solution is to circumvent the most problematic part of power management by lowering the power allowance for these dGPUs. That can be achieved by altering the kext AppleGraphicsPowerManagement.kext. That can be made easier by using a ready made patch for that. Performance will be a bit reduced by that.\n\nMBPMid2010_GPUFix is an utility program that allows to fix MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010) intermittent black screen or loss of video. The algorithm is based on a solution provided by user fabioroberto on MacRumors forums.\n\nIf that is the case, then a good, and permanent, proper, fix would be to replace the cheap capacitor. Apple will not do that at all out of a bizarre principle and Apple also forbids AASPs do this kind of repair (the machine in question also is way out of warranty and AppleCare). That means owners holding on to these machines have to look for a trustworthy hardware repair shop that is not an AASP and willing to do this. The cost for the parts will make you laugh with tears.

I am using an iPhone 7 on iOS 10.1.1 and I need some help! \nEvery time I get a notification it is empty/blank, only the name of the app is in the title. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Same is happening to me. I'm on 10.1.1, downgraded from 10.2, but didn't notice if the issue started after upgrading to 10.2 or only after the downgrade.\nI've found someone on the internet (couldn't find the link again) that suggested deleting and reinstalling each app, which I tested with one app and worked. But I'm still looking for a better solution, since it would be a real pain to delete and reinstall every single app...\nFor me, upgrading again to 10.2 and back to 10.1.1, but it didn't fix the problem.\nWorst case, you can wipe all settings per this reddit thread which resolved my issues on this subject.\n\nI went to Settings > General > Reset > Reset all settings\n\nBe careful not to reset settings and data The above option has similar wording, but only resets your settings without deleting apps content and data files / content. \n", "Q: MacOS: unable to resize partitions after bootcamp failed I tried to install Win10 with Bootcamp on my MacBook Air running MacOS Sierra 10.12.1. Doing so I changed my main partition in order to create the one for Bootcamp. But when running the Windows setup I had to choose the partition onto which to install Windows and always got an error there. So I tried reformatting the Bootcamp partition within the Windows setup, but also failed. \nSo I decided to stop and remove the Bootcamp partition. But somehow I can not delete nor merge it with the MacOS partition. The disk utility app says I can not remove the partition because the other one (MacOS) can not be resized. FileVault is deactivated. \nSo what can I do? By the way, the terminal command line diskutil cs or corestorage list does not work:\ndiskutil cs list\nNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found\n\nHere's the output from the terminal and from the disk utility app.\n\n\nThe Bootcamp assistant won't allow me to restart the whole process since it can not resize the main partition and it does not let me choose the second partition as a target. Any idea how to cleanup all partitions?\n\nA: I somehow managed to do it. First, I reformatted all small hidden partitions from disk0s4 to disk0s8 using this command:\ndiskutil erasevolume JHFS+ data5 disk0s4\n\nThen I merged all those partitions using this command:\ndiskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ BOOTCAMP disk0s4 disk0s8\n\nFinally I used the visual disk utility app to remove the newly created BOOTCAMP partition, which then gave all the empty space to my MacOS partition.\n", "Q: What is LPSS Serial Adapter in my network tab Recently I have found that there are a network device called LPSS Serial Adapter (1) and LPSS Serial Adapter (2) in my network settings on my 2016 15\" MacBook Pro, it has a phone (modem I guess) icon:\n\nI tries to delete it, but it just comes back in a reboot. This doe not appear in any other Macs that I've own.\nWhat is it?\nP.S. It appears both on macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2659) and 10.12.2 (16C67)\n\nA: The LPSS adapters are related to a chip feature on the new 2016 MacBook Pros.  I found these interfaces present immediately after setting up a new 15-inch 2016 Touch Bar model out of the box (before plugging in any peripherals or installing any drivers).\nThe following patent filing for the \"low power subsystem\" describes an interface through which a \"secondary\" processor can provide access to the system's memory while the primary processor is powered down:\n\nThe subsystem acts independently of the CPU, which would not be able to perform the necessary functions during low power mode. The subsystem allows the notebook to perform several functions while in the low power mode, such as, for example, act like a travel assistant for the user, provide entertainment, and make electronic purchases.\n\n\nA: That is typically a USB to Serial (RS-232) adapter used in asynchronous communications (modem, serial port, console port, etc).\nTo \"see\" the device details in your hardware profile, open up \"System Report\" under About this Mac\n \nIf you disconnect everything from the computer, remove all the vpn and all other network interfaces, you could reboot in safe mode and determine all the Apple native interfaces. At that point, any new interfaces that show up will be due to profiles and third party software added.

Is that the case? It is possible that you have the screen brighter, or glossy rather than matte, or are using it differently, but I can't really say.\nIn general, you should take short breaks every 10 or 20 minutes and have a screen brightness that matches the ambient environment (many people make it too bright which forces them to squint or tense up and get headaches) to prevent eye strain, and remember to blink frequently to prevent dry eye.\nShort of that, I'd say change the resolution to whatever feels better for you, or see if anyone you know would be interested in trading laptops if you find theirs to be easier on your eyes.\n\nA: Just configure it at the scale you prefer, and ignore the message that it is being scaled.  A 2016 MacBook Pro should have no trouble with it.\n\nA: Macbook pro 2016 15\" native resolution is 2880x1800, and even if the default resolution is 1680x1050, 1440x900 will look sharpest due to each pixel of GUI elements being rendered by exactly 4 pixels. \nIn fact, Apple's all iPhone and iPad displays default to this type of 1:2 scaling, because it puts least amount of stress to the GPU and results in best text sharpness. \nHowever, from a screen real-estate point of view, to make for more space Apple started setting the default resolution to 1680x1050 on Macbook Pro 15\" devices. If you have a good eyesight, you can definitely realize the sharpness difference between 1440x900 and 1680x1050 and that difference might be bothering you. My advice is, use the looks like  1440x900 option even if it says that it is scaled. It will supposedly deliver best text sharpness. Generally, UI elements will be bigger, which will also put less strain on your eyes, which in turn will result in a more comfortable user experience. \nWhen you really need more screen-real estate, you can use the 1680x1050 or even more space options for shorter durations. \nAt this time, it looks like it is time for Apple to bump up the screen resolutions of Macbook Pro's even higher to deliver more space to users, This would allow using the 1:2 scaling which results in true retina experience. For that, native resolution for your laptop screen should have beeen 3360x2100, which is not the case (yet). \n", "Q: Cannot switch source with Apple TV 4 and Samsung TV I just got the Apple TV 4th Gen and once I've it set up, I cannot change the input to my XBOX.

But recently I added another account and now I've all my accounts separated by section instead of by email.\nIs there a way to have it like:\nemail1@example.com\n    inbox\n    sent\n    junk\n    trash\n    archive\nemail2@example2.com\n    inbox\n    sent\n    junk\n    trash\n    archive\n\ninstead of:\ninbox\n    email1@example.com\n    email2@example2.com\nsent\n    email1@example.com\n    email2@example2.com\njunk\n    email1@example.com\n    email2@example2.com\ntrash\n    email1@example.com\n    email2@example2.com\n\nI understand why apple did this, to have a practical way of viewing all my emails inbox at once but I don't need it and always check my accounts separately.\n\nA: The answer, unfortunately in your case, is \"no\". Apple's Mail.app does not have the ability to group maiboxes by account rather than by function.\nAny mailboxes other than these \"special\" ones stored on IMAP servers do get sorted by account, down in the sidebar section where mailboxes that are stored \"On My Mac\" are listed. \nThus, if you set up IMAP accounts so that Mail.app does not store \"Sent\", \"Drafts\", \"Junk\" and \"Trash\" mailboxes on the server but rather stores them \"On My Mac\", you could sort of simiulate some of the look that you want and those IMAP mailboxes would get listed down with any other IMAP mailboxes that are on the server. However, set up in this way, the functionality of the various menu commands and automatic things that Mail.app does with those folders would not work (well they would \"work\" but just not using the IMAP mailboxes), and you would have two sets of all these \"special\" mailboxes listed in the sidebar - those on the servers below and those stored locallay listed above all grouped together in the manner you don't like.\n", "Q: How to skip Safari's \"Do you want to allow this page to open X\" dialog? I'm pretty sure I haven't changed any setting or installed anything other than software updates, but today I've started getting this dialog when I clicked a magnet link:\n\nHow do I get rid of this dialog?

Cheers.\n\nA: Of course I do not know the total scope of what you're trying to accomplish however because as you presently have it coded, the script could be running from other then the target USB Drive. So I've written it a bit differently, however it does get the mount point based on the serial number if the target USB Drive is mounted. You can then branch accordingly to the conditions, i.e. whether the script is running from the target USB Drive or not and if the target USB Drive is mounted or not, etc. After getting the mount point in the code, I've included another block of code to test against if the target USB Drive is mounted and where the script was run from. This obviously is just one example of testing and you'll have to do as you need. The bottom line here is, how I coded getting the mount point of the target USB Drive based on the serial number and this I guess it what you're really looking for.\nHere's my take on the code and it's output when run from both the Desktop and the target USB Drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Before use, change the actual serial number below to the appropriate value.\n\n\n\nAppleScript Code:\n--    #

The articles I've read regarding this aren't very clarifying.\nDoes an iTunes restore restore the firmware?  At the end of the iTunes restore (not DFU), I can see \"restoring iPhone firmware\", but I had a chat with Apple through GSX and the technician told me that this is just \"a misnomer\", the firmware is only restored in DFU mode.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*DFU writes the firmware and then the OS. \n\n*Restore writes the OS only. \n\n\nMy guess is the misnomer is firmware like carrier updates and modem scripts will be layered on after either OS restore. Also, these names originated when the iOS devices were far simpler. Secure enclave, secure boot chain, forward secrecy and encryption at rest make the update procedure far more uniform. Maybe that's also what GSX is alluding to - you don't really write all the firmware anymore on current / modern iOS devices. \n", "Q: Can I connect Apple Airpods to a Toshiba Portege laptop running Windows 8.1? Apple's Airpods promise seamless connectivity to iPhones and Macs through intelligent sensors. \nAt work I use my existing Apple Earpods for Skype business conference calls - as they provide a mic and earphones that are simpler and more compatible than other USB based headgear. (They integrate with the earphone/mic combo jack port.)\nNow I want to replace my Earpods (which are fantastic) with AirPods. Is this feasible?\nMy question is: Can I connect Apple Airpods to a Toshiba Portege laptop running Windows 8.1?\n\nA: I connect mine with various Windows devices.  On my desktop (Win 7 Pro) I put the airpods in discovery mode (push the button on the back until the white light flashes) and then go to Devices.  Select add a device and wait until the list populates.  Your airpods will be there.  Click on it and let the drivers load.\n\nA: No. Microsoft Skype for business does not support AirPods at this time (Jan 2018).  It's really strange. They will work with most other applications running in windows, but there is some conflict that Microsoft has not been able/unwilling to fix wherein the microphone will work, but there is no playback audio.\n", "Q: Can I install Yosemite on a different Mac with another Apple ID Can I use a copy of OS X Yosemite installer to install Yosemite on a Mac owned by someone else who obviously has a different Apple ID?\n\nA: Yosemite should be a free upgrade.\nYou can also download it for free here.\nhttps://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/48498/os-x-yosemite\n", "Q: Watch iPhone videos without transfer to Mac How can I watch the videos I recorded on my iPhone without first transferring them to my drive, so that I can Shazam the music in them?

So when the MacBook goes into standby mode (hibernate) and the FileVault password is requested, the only user who can unlock it is 'admin'.\nThis used to work fine, but after reinstalling the MacBook this setup has stopped working. When the system wakes from standby, the 'admin' password isn't accepted. I am sure the password is correct, since I can use is fine when I start from boot.\nI have already changed the password, but that didn't help.\nI am running macOS Sierra with all the updates.\nWhat is wrong and how can I fix this?\n\nA: Seems the password is not the problem, but the keyboard is. After waking up from standby the keyboard and touchpad stutter, so some keys become missing when typing in the password.\n\nA: The recent macOS Sierra 10.12.3 update, though it did not call out this issue, fixed this problem for me.

When I put it into DFU/Recovery Mode and connect it to iTunes, it isn't able to restore it. It keeps throwing \"Network Connection Problems\" -- it downloads iOS 10 for a bit and suddenly stops downloading, throwing the error. I've also tried downloading a custom .ipsw from https://ipsw.me/ but it seems that the file is corrupted whenever iTunes tries to unpack it. \nAny thoughts on how I could go about fixing this? \nNote - I don't have a jailbroken iPhone.\n\nA: The network error means iTunes can't get the files it needs from Apple so there's nothing to do on the phone at this point.\nThe fastest way to sort any iOS device that says “connect to iTunes” and your preferred iTunes isn’t working is to take your iOS device to iTunes on a computer that you know works. Apple stores maintain multiple installations of iTunes ready to restore devices. No data sync happens when you are at the “restore screen” but you can check for local backups in iTunes when you’re done if you like. \nAs to fixing your specific error, can you take your PC/Mac to a different network or take the phone to a different computer? Sometimes that's far easier than diagnosing one iTunes that isn't working for a rare event like a DFU restore.\nIf you want to troubleshoot your iTunes, I would start with:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204770\nIt's quite detailed, so you will want to make note of the exact error message and be sure to follow steps like updating the computer and iTunes as well as making sure anti virus and other security software and network blocks aren't the cause of network errors.\n", "Q: Can't login after migration assistant.

I've seen that this may be an issue with file vault preferences, but I can't change them if I can't log in!\nOr will I just have to wait until my IT support is able to do this for me?\n\nA: I hope you have resolved this by now, but if not, you can first try booting into Recovery Mode (Command-R for local version or Command-Option-R for internet version).\nOnce you are in, select Utilities > Utilities which will open a very plain window with a command prompt.\nHere, type in \"resetpassword\" and press enter.\nYou should now be presented with a more Mac-like window to help you set/reset the password for your available accounts.\nIf this doesn't work, just come back and we'll try other options.\n", "Q: Keep all system logs, forever In console app I can see only couple system.log.${i}.gz archived log files that can only show me info about last 10-15 days.\nHow to keep all logs archived somewhere, forever ?\n\nA: The log files are rotated and eventually removed by the asl system. You can change the configuration by editing /etc/asl.conf under sudo. Start Terminal.app and issue this command:\nsudo -e /etc/asl.conf\n\nYou'll find in there a comment stating that rules for /var/log/system.log follows, the first line looks like this:\n> system.log mode=0640 format=bsd rotate=seq compress file_max=5M all_max=50M\n\nChange that to look like this:\n> system.log mode=0640 format=bsd rotate=seq compress file_max=5M all_max=9999G ttl=99999\n\nThis means that each seperate log file will be maximum 5M.

I'm currently operating on a late 2013 MacBook Pro and am eager to buying a wireless keyboard for my setup. I was looking at the Logitech MK345, which is a bluetooth mouse-keyboard combo, and thought it was quite what I needed. Although, it didn't really say anywhere that it worked with Mac. I tried looking for answers to see if non-mac keyboards function properly with OS X and only saw answers for wired ones. \nI'm pretty confused... Should I take the risk of buying the keyboard? Any suggestions to what I should do? Thanks. \n\nA: Yes in general. Bluetooth has an HID profile that lets mice and keyboard work with any other Bluetooth receiver that supports that profile. macOS and Mac hardware support the standard profile, so at worst, you are likely to need to remap windows specific keys and deal with no Apple specific keys. \n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use a non-Apple keyboard with OS X?\nUnless the keyboard you buy requires some custom driver or isn't standard Bluetooth, you should have low chances of needing to return it or have it not work at all. In specific, you are looking at a USB keyboard not a Bluetooth one, so that's also going to work with the limitations that special keys and drivers and software won't work on macOS. The majority of the keys will work. \n", "Q: DuetHeuristic-BM and nsurlsessiond hogging CPU and Memory on MacBook Air I recently updated my MacBook Air to macOS 10.12.2 and there are these two programs, DuetHeuristic-BM and nsurlsessiond which have been hogging CPU and memory continuously:\n\nThis heats up the machine and has significantly reduced the battery life.

Tap the new iPod and answer your account security questions to see details about it and locate it on a map (\"Show in Find My iPhone...\") provided that it is powered on and set up for Find My iPhone.\nOr you can open the Find iPhone app on your phone if you don't remember your security questions and want to locate it. If you see it's on and in your house, you can make it ring to locate it, but that will get rid of the surprise I guess. Or if it looks like someone else somewhere else is using the device with your Apple ID, you can wipe the device and remove it from your account.\n", "Q: How can I silence the screenshot camera sound? The sound effects for screenshots can be really annoying and loud at certain times.  How can I turn this off?  It makes the noise even when my volume is all the way down?\nUpdate: I want to simply silence the sound effect, without any other side effects.  Turning on the phone's vibration mode means it will make noise when something causes it to vibrate, so this defeats the purpose.\n\nA: To my knowledge, there technically is not a way to specifically and only disable the camera shutter sound for screenshots, but there are still solutions to stop it from making the sound:\nOne thing you can do is flip the mute toggle switch on the side of your device to be muted (silent/vibrate). You will see a Ringer Silent icon on the screen and may feel a vibration on an iPhone. After that, there will be no noise from the screenshot (among other things).\nOn an iPhone, if you don't wan't to get the vibration when turning the phone to silent, or if you want to leave it on silent without getting vibrations, you can go to Settings > Sound and toggle \"Vibrate on Silent\" off. Then it won't vibrate or make any noise. However, you also won't hear any notification sounds or vibrations at all, so you run the risk of missing some alerts. So in this case what you may want to do is flip the mute toggle to silent right before taking a screenshot (and it won't make any noise from vibration), and then after the screenshot flip it back to normal.\nAnother alternative, if you don't mind the camera shutter sound but just want it quieter, is that in Settings > Sounds you can slide Ringer and Alerts to minimum. It'll still make sounds, just quietly. But again you run the risk of missing your phone ringing in some situations as it'll be quiet.\nEdit: I noticed that on iOS 10.3, when you toggle the mute switch while the camera is open, it does not make any vibration. So you could just toggle it to mute before you take the picture, and then toggle back to normal when you're done.\n\nA: In some ways this answer I'm about to give is a horrible kludge, but it's quick and somewhat effective.  Kal-al's answer (please up-vote it!) may be more useful to some people, but it appears that Apple has given us no way to electronically silence the camera shutter sound effect.  The software offers no interface to independently do this, without some side effect of silencing something else. \nTherefore, the simplest and quickest way I've found is a low-tech and utterly physical solution: to put your thumb over the speaker on the right side of the base of your phone.  If you have a case on your phone it will be less effective.  If you have no case it will do a fairly good job muffling any sound coming out of the speaker.  Whether it's quiet enough for you depends on your situation.  Perhaps if this is combined with some aspects of Kal-al's answer, you might be able to make the sound negligible.\n\nA: I found an option (on an Ipad) that will make it so that ringers and alerts will not be silenced. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: How do I open old Notes saved on my external hard drive?

I am using a Macbook pro (Sierra 10.12.1),  under a non-admin account and I do not have the admin password. I was wondering how much of my data (passwords, files, etc) is accessible by the admin? \n\nA: A user with administrator privileges can read all your unencrypted files. And you have to assume the access to your data can happen without you knowing it (an administrator can simply take backup of the system and access the backed up files offline leaving no trace on the system).\nOne exception is the keychain file (the one containing all your saved passwords). It is encrypted and, by default, protected with the same password as the one you use for login. An administrator cannot access the contents and cannot change the password to this file without knowing the current one. Thus the administrator cannot access your saved passwords, credentials, and other data which you store in the Keychain etc.\nThe above applies only to passive \"attack\". A rogue administrator can install a key logger and simply learn your password by  sniffing \n\nA: The admin can't simply open up your files in finder and call it good. If the admin is using a finder window, they would have to actually change the file permissions to allow read and write to all users, under \"get info\". They can also change your password and then log in as you.\nIn terminal, the admin can access all the files as well as change your password with sudo. \n", "Q: Cannot open sparsebundle to review Backups.backupdb I'm trying to open the Backups.backupdb folder and when I try to open the sparse bundle I get the following error message.\n\nThe application \"DiskImageMounter.app\" can't be opened. -36\n\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: First, disable Time Machine backup.

I have an image of screw heads (source) that I would like to print in its original size onto a sheet of (8.5 by 11 inches letter) paper.\nOpening the JPG in Preview, clicking File → Print, and then setting the \"Scale\" value to \"100%\" definitely does not accomplish this. In my case, it blows the image up so large that the picture doesn't even fit on one page.\nDoes anyone know how to do this on a Mac?\n\nA: To print an image so that the output is at 1:1 scale to the object it depicts, the image must either be specified with the proper ppi (pixels per inch), or the scaling of the printed output must take into account the desired dimensions.\nThere are a few ways to get the correct sizing.  One way is to print the image twice:  the first time, printed at 100%, will produce a result in this case that is larger than desired.  Measure the printed size of one of the objects with known length; I recommend choosing the largest object that fits on the page.  Then the correct scaling factor to apply is (actual length) / (printed length) x 100%.  So for example, if a 3-inch screw depicted in the image is printed out at 100%, and has a length of 5.2 inches in the print, the scaling factor to apply to the next print is 3/(5.2) x 100% = 57.6923%.\nIf you cannot make more than one print, or if printing at 100% results in no objects of known length fitting on the page, then you could also use an image editor that can read raster images and measure the distance in pixels between two points on the image (e.g., Adobe Photoshop).  So for example, the original image is 2048 x 1536 pixels, and has a printing resolution of 72 ppi.  If you measure the length of a 3-inch screw, and find that it is 720 pixels, for example, then the ppi setting that will make it print to scale is (720 px)/(3 in) = 240 ppi.  Then you can either change this value in the image editing program and print it at 100%; or you can leave it at 72 ppi and print it at 72/240 x 100% = 30%.\nNote that in both cases, you must know the real-life dimensions of an object in the image.\n\nAfter downloading the image, I measured it and found that a length of 4 inches corresponds to approximately 758 pixels in the image.  This gives a resolution of approximately 189.5 ppi, which means that you can either set the image to this value, or print it at a scale of 38%.\n\nA: The print size on that image is 28.444\" x 21.333\" (722.49 × 541.87 millimeters), so there is no way it can fit on a 8.5\" x 11\" piece of paper at its original size. Therefore, you have no choice but to scale it to fit on an 8.5\" x 11\" piece of paper.\n\n\n", "Q: What change does the OS need to make, given this message? \"iCloud Preferences wants to make changes to your account\" This message appears when I log on to my machine.

This is usually for a feature such as the Apple Watch unlock, whereby the Apple Watch can unlock your local account through iCloud.\n\nA: Regarding the answer given above by 'grg': In other words, it seems that this would appear to be granting iCloud the ability to be authenticated to access my local user account -- and make changes to application data on my system -- whenever my system is booted up and establishing a connection to iCloud.

You could configure complicated filters based on given starts for the tracks, genres, years, etc. and to generate the Smart Playlists, which allowed to play the same music with the specific order on your devices.\nI checked my settings (the latest iOS and OS Sierra) - and I still have the smart playlists, so Apple haven't removed the possibility of using them.

Things to look into here are\n\n\n*\n\n*launchd: Allows programs/scripts to be run based on certain conditions. Of special interest for you is probably the WatchPaths parameter which allows to watch a path/directory for changes and triggers a program/script if necessary. There are race conditions involved here, but for your case you probably can catch them easily. The full format for launchd configuration files is available with man launchd.plist\n\n*Shell/bash scripting: The code to execute if a file arrives probably isn't too complex, so some basic scripts should be enough\n\n*How to send an email from command line?\n\nOn second thought, I would ignore the WatchPaths part completely. Just use launchd to run a shell script every 30 minutes (or whatever is appropriate) which, if no new file has arrived since when-ever, sends a notification to wherever.\n", "Q: Does Forced shutdown damage Mac? Does Forced Shutdown, pushing power button until Mac shuts down, damage hard drive? Or operation system?\nCan it cause damage to Mac's security so it will get weaker towards malicious things?\nAnd if I run Disk Utility after forced shutdown, will it find any potential damage?\nI've had it happen few times, but no underlying continuous problems, just want to know what could happen.\n\nA: A forced shutdown doesn't damage your hardware nor does it weaken your security.\nWhat it could potentially do is corrupt files because you are turning off the computer while they are open/active.  These files can be anything from an open webpage or text file to system files that in use for any reason (like an update).\nfsck checks for inconsistencies in the filesystem.  Meaning it looks at the blocks, the inodes, the used space, the free space, etc. to see if everything \"adds up.\"    For instance, it will check the blocks and the sizes, if there is an error it will attempt to fix.\nHowever, it won't repair a file that has been corrupted or the data lost - it simply can't recreate data.\nAs for \"being dangerous to security\" there's no direct link to your filesystem getting corrupted and security being compromised.  If your file system has been corrupted to the point that services fail to load or critical files cannot be loaded you will know about it as the system will generate errors.\nIt will NOT suddenly open ports in your firewall or make your password go blank.  \n\nA: The main risk is file corruption. If the system is writing to a file when it loses power, then that file may end up containing incomplete or inconsistent information, or be rendered completely unreadable.\nOS X will often run a filesystem check (fsck) automatically when you reboot after a forced shutdown, so by the time you can run Disk Utility to run a manual verification, it will probably already have found and fixed anything it can. It won't hurt to do it again, but fsck and Disk Utility can only find and fix certain types of problem; it's certainly still possible to end up with corrupted files that they'll never detect.\n", "Q: Cancel file dragging on Mac Is it possible to cancel file dragging on a Mac? I've noticed that with the escape key, you can cancel file dragging within the Finder, but if you're dragging the file onto another application you can't cancel it (which in my opinion seems very annoying when you really just want to cancel the file dragging). Is there any way to cancel the file dragging in such circumstances?\n\nA: You can drag the file to the menu bar (top bar) and release it. That will cancel the dragging in any app (afaik).\n\nA: Whilst dragging you can command-Tab (without releasing your click-and-drag). If you command-Tab back to Finder you can then click escape. If you command-tab to any application which will not accept the dropped file then you will receive a beep alert and the drag-and-drop will be cancelled.\n", "Q: How to recover an iMovie I am currently in the process of recovering information from a damaged hard drive on a Late-2009 iMac. I am using LazeSoft Data Recovery for the recovery process. Thus far it has worked quite well and I have recovered many of my pictures.\nHowever, the one very unfortunate thing is that I am - thus far - unable to recover my iMovie movie. The movie was completed and saved (I had put it onto a DVD, but I don't have that copy). So my question is, how do I recover this type of file? I believe the movie was approximately 4 GB in size and so I attempted to save it to a 250 GB drive, it still said the file was too large for the drive. Also, once I got the files that I thought belonged to the movie, I could not open them on the identical iMac that I am using now (which doesn't have iMovie, but does have QuickTime). What am I missing here? \n\nA: The short answer is you recover this file in the same way you'd recover any other file, but this assumes you're only wanting to recover the final movie you produced and not all of the raw footage and project files? It also assumes you exported the video in a playable format (i.e. not just to DVD, but also as a single video file such as a .mov or .mp4 file)?\nIf so, any good data recovery package will provide filtering options that make it easier for you to isolate and recover what you want. In your case, if you know you saved it as an .mp4 for example, and that the file size was about 4GB, you should be able to select .mp4 as a file type and select any matching files within the vicinity of 4GB in size.\nIf you're not 100% sure of the file type, any good data recovery package will also group files into categories such as Pictures, Movies, etc. In this case you could select any video or movie files that are around the 4GB size.\nAnother option some packages will give you is the ability to see the original path of the files. If so you can look for files in your user's Movies folder in which there should be a number of iMovie folders and files. This may allow you to browse and find what you're looking for.\nDid you create a disk image instead?\nMany standard definition videos of about 1hr duration compress to about 4GB in size when saved as a disk image, so it is possible that you've done just that. Of course, if it was a high definition video then it's duration would be a lot less if it resulted in a 4GB file. \nRegardless, the fact is iMovie provides the option of saving it's projects as disk images. In this case you would be looking for a .img file to recover. These files do not play in Quicktime by default as they're not movie files, they're disk images. \nYou will need to mount the disk image first before you can access the data. Typically you can just double-click on them and this will mount the disk just like any other drive (i.e. it will appear just like you plugged a USB stick into your computer).\nOnce the disk image is mounted, you can access the files. If what you see is a movie file you should be able to play it in QuickTime. However, if what you find is two folders labelled AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS then what you have is a DVD disk image. You can play this in the DVD Player app, or you can choose to create a physical DVD from it using an app such as Burn or Toast to copy the disk image to DVD.\nNOTE\nYou should be aware that recovering data is not perfect. You may be able to recover the file and all is good, or you may find that it's also corrupted in some way (e.g. the video data is there, but the audio data is missing, etc). Also, it may be that the data isn't all located in a single file any more, or that some of it is missing, so if you have no luck finding it by recovering files around the 4GB size, you may need to recover files well below that in the hope of some success.\n", "Q: how to swipe Mail in iOS I don't remember if I was using android or the gmail app, but I was able to swipe to move to the next or previous mail (in any of the mail apps).\nI am now using an iPhone, so how can I achieve this? is it configurable? another mail app?\n\nA: Apple's native mail app doesn't allow swipe to work that way on iPhone since swipes are for marking / archiving / moving or deleting by design.\nOn larger iOS devices - portrait mode works the same as the iPhone (non S size) but landscape mode has a navigation sidebar for navigating.\nIt's not a swipe, but it helps triage mails for me.\nYou might look at Inbox by Gmail on iOS - it has a snooze feature that could be used to swipe past mails like tinder allows you to swipe to filter and file a queue of people.\n", "Q: Impossible for me to open Dropbox in Mac OS X 10.6.8 I'm working with 2 different Mac systems: 10.1 and 10.6.8.

This graphics card uses a minimum of 384 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with your main memory (i.e. your computer's RAM). The amount of memory it actually uses will vary depending on your graphics needs. \nIn terms of connecting an external display, your computer has a Thunderbolt digital video output port and supports the following display modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual display extended\n\n*Video mirroring\n\n*AirPlay Mirroring (not relevant in your scenario)\n\n\nYour MacBook Pro supports an external resolution up to 2560 x 1600 pixels.\nAs for the Dell UltraSharp U2715H this has an optimal resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels at 60Hz.\nIn terms of your concern relating to black rectangles and aspect ratios, this will depend on how you use it? Do you intend to extend your display or mirror it?\nRegardless, this monitor uses a 16:9 aspect ratio and your MacBook Pro supports the following resolutions at the 16:10 aspect ratio (that you can mirror):\n\n\n*\n\n*1280 x 800 (native)\n\n*1152 x 720\n\n*1024 x 640\n\n*800 x 500 \n\n\nWhether the difference between 16:10 and 16:9 will annoy you, only you can answer.\nHowever, if you want to use it in dual display extended mode (I'm guessing you do), then you would just take advantage of the best resolution your MBP can output to the monitor.\nThe only hesitation I would have (and this would apply to any external display) is that you haven't specified how much RAM you have, so if you intend to do anything that is graphics heavy on the external display, you may find the Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics card struggling.\nOtherwise you should be happy with this display (if you really need the 27\").\n[EDIT]\n(Additional info re screens with DVI ports)\nIf you go ahead with a different external display requiring a DVI connection and find that the highest available resolution is 1280 x 800 instead of 2560 x 1600, this is likely due to you using a single-link DVI connection on a display that requires a dual-link DVI connection. (Note: This is not a factor for the U2715H you're looking at, but may be for others).\nIf this happens you would need to connect the display to a dual-link DVI port to access the higher resolutions available. However, your model MacBook Pro does not provide a dual-link DVI connection without an appropriate adaptor!\nFor best results you will need to use a Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter.\nYou should refer to this info on Apple's website (as the general info is still applicable to many external displays). Also of interest may be this Mini DisplayPort adapter FAQs page.\n\nA: I don't think this is the best place for purchase suggestions, however considering it is apple hardware that is involved you may be lucky.\nAs for your question, how about a bit of googling?

Simply uncheck the option \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\", and Cmd-Tab will no longer make you switch Spaces.\nClicking on an app icon in the Dock will also no longer switch spaces, unless the app is already selected (its name is in the menubar), in which case further clicks on the icon will cycle you through any Spaces with a window open for that app. Not 100% what you are asking for, but if the app is already selected you should have no reason to click the icon again anyway.\n\nA: Terminal solution for anyone wanting to automate it (e.g. when setting up a new mac).\ndefaults write -g AppleSpacesSwitchOnActivate -bool false\n\nEquivalent to opening System Preferences > Mission Control and then toggling the When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application checkbox.\n\n\nA: This behavior is controlled by disabling a \"gesture\" in the mouse functionality.

After I replace the notes files, I can usually close and reopen Notes and my notes appear. If I transfer V4 files into V6 Notes, the files are removed and re-replaced with V6 files due to, I'm assuming, compatibility.\nHow else can I export notes then from an older Notes to a newer Notes?\n\nOn Yosemite:\n\n\nOn Sierra: (Where I'm trying to transfer)\nSame iCloud sync as above.\n\n\nA: Why not just sync your notes using iCloud? \nIf they aren’t currently associated with your iCloud account, just copy them over to that account (within the Notes app) on the machine running Yosemite. Then, enable iCloud on the machine running Sierra, checkmark “Notes” to sync under iCloud preferences, and then you’ve successfully transferred them. \nIt’s a much easier solution than navigating through the filesystem and manually selecting the data.\n\nA: i have the same problem, but i extracted the files (NotesV4.storedata\nNotesV4.storedata-shm\nNotesV4.storedata-wal)\n, and with novicat premiun on the table ---> ZNOTEBODY, copy the html string and with html editor online only copy paste the code, and you have the note, and copy and paste on the notes.app.\n\nA: If they aren't as of now connected with your iCloud account, simply duplicate them over to that record (inside the Notes application) on the machine running Yosemite. At that point, empower iCloud on the machine running Sierra, checkmark \"Notes\" to match up under iCloud inclinations, and after that you've effectively exchanged them.\n\nA: I'd upgrade the old MBP, so the notes would be converted in the process. Failing that, I'd create a small Yosemite partition on the newer MBP, copy the notes there and upgrade it to Sierra.\n\nA: I just imported them. I had a directory containing my old V4 notes from Yosemite:\nNotesV4.storedata\nNotesV4.storedata-shm\nNotesV4.storedata-wal\nOpened Notes in Sierra, selected File, Import to Notes, then selected the directory containing the above files and clicked Import.\nNotes imported it to a new directory called Notes on This Mac and I moved them across to the Cloud/Notes.\nEasy peasy!\n\nA: This is a manual solution, works on a per note basis..  \nTL,DR : set up screen share to connect the computers. Then copy and paste the note between computers, it will copy over all attachments as well, embedded figures, linked files, etc. \nTo get a note from computer \"A\" to computer \"B\", connect both computers to the same local network, and then :\n\n\n*\n\n*on computer \"A\", go to system preferences , sharing, and then select screen share and note the hostname provided e.g.  vnc://name@foo.bar\n\n*on computer \"B\", go to screen sharing, then enter the hostname for computer \"A\"\n\n*now you are on computer \"B\", but you can interact with computer \"A\" in a screen-share window, so go to that window, navigate to the notes, and then click the body of the note you want, Command+A to highlight everything, Command+C to copy . \n\n*go to the notes app in computer \"B\", create a new note, and in the body press Command+V.

But besides a vpn, you could try going to settings>mail>your specific mail account. This may give you the option to change the incoming mail server, but it may not. But you can change the outgoing mail server by adding a entire new secondary server in case the first one doesn't work.

I installed Perian but I had no luck with it.\nThank you for your time, hope you can help me.\n\nA: Unfortunately this has a simple answer. Quicktime will not play any type of video file, some types it just fails on.\nYou used to be able to buy the MPEG-2 Codec from Apple as an add-on for Quicktime to allow you to play more kinds of video files but I don't believe they sell it any more.\nYou have already found the solution to playback though: VLC.\nFlip4Mac used to be a Microsoft solution for playback of WMV video files but they don't support it anymore. Instead Telestream has the software, which you can purchase on their website.\nAnd any video that Quicktime chokes on will likely also fail on any Apple apps like Keynote.

Is this true and if so is there a way around this?\n\nA: If you've subscribed to Apple Music, or if all the music you own is purchased, then all the music you have is the same on all of your Apple devices and yes, when you delete them from your Apple Music library then you'll lose the download of that song but it will always be available to you for as long as your subscription lasts.\nIf you've ripped CDs (or obtained content by other means) you'll need to copy those files from your work computer to external media and put them on your home computer.

If you put the finger in front of the right camera (watching the screen) you see your finger no matter how much you zoom, if you put your finger in front on the left camera then you will never see the finger.\nAt this point i thought that maybe the preview was taken only from the right camera and then when you actually take the picture it gets the image from one or the other according to how much you zoom.\nBut the picture that i took gave the same result that the preview did, finger on the right camera -> you get a black picture, finger on the left camera -> you get the image without the finger, no matter how much you zoom.\nHow does it work?\nIs it an issue with my iPhone or do i just not get something?\nThank you everybody!\nEDIT:\nI tried both pinching the screen to zoom and using the \"1x\" button to activate the \"2x\" zoom, and i got the same result\n\nA: You're probably just using the digital zoom and never switching cameras. You describe the zoom as \"smooth\" - this sounds like you're not switching cameras.\nTo switch between the cameras, press the \"1x\" circled button and it will show \"2x\". This is the secondary camera.\nYou can do digital zoom on either camera afterwards.\n\nA: I did a simple test to see how this actually work by actually covering the camera in the left (the telephoto lens). I found this pattern: in low lighting the iPhone will always use the wide angle lens (on the right) and digital zoom. Other cases the iPhone will switch to the telephoto on zooms greater than 2x. The iPhone didn't switch to the telephoto when you're covering the lens is because when you cover up the wide angle lens it tricks the iPhone into thinking that it is in low lighting so it will use digital zoom instead.\n\nA: Low-light photos are so much better than they used to be, since the Camera app can combine data from both lenses, the optical image stabilization helps keep things steady, and the wide-angle lens’s f/1.8 aperture lets in a lot more light than the f/2.2 lens in the iPhone 6s,The new Portrait mode coming to iOS 10.1 is a great example of what the iPhone 7 Plus’s exclusive two-lens camera system can do. Since this mode is still in beta (both the feature itself, and iOS 10.1, are in beta as of this writing)\n", "Q: Move iTunes media files to a different location I'm organising my iTunes media in two folder myself /Volumes/Data/Music and /Volumes/Data/OtherMusic.

Then more chance it's dirty contacts; but the dock may be failing.\n", "Q: For iMessage for MacOS, where do the face images come from? for years I have been using the Contacts app to track addresses. I use Gmail as my main address book so it seems to either copy the Google user avatar to the contact card, or if a matching Facebook user is found, it will sync their profile picture. What I am wondering is where does iMessage get its user avatars from? They are definitely different from what is in my contacts, especially since many of my contacts lack them but for other iMessage users out there (presumably with iPhones) a different use avatar is shown. I presume that is the avatar that they are using on their iPhone or possibly with iCloud. That's all well and good, but is there a way to get the Contacts app to use those images for syncing and to have them overrule either the Google or Facebook avatars?\nWhat is also interesting is that Messages on my iPhone or iPad uses the avatars from Contacts, not what it gets from iMessage like the MacOS version. I would like to control the behavior- ideally by deciding which avatar to pick for a given user, but I would setting on a scheme that is used for all users. For example, unless the user has their own iMessage avatar, use their Facebook Profile, and saving that, use their Google avatar. Does anyone know if this is possible?\nThanks!\n\nA: I don't know of a solution where you can prioritize where the contact information is pulled from, but I would imagine your default is your locally saved contact. \nI recommend you to save all of your contacts into one place, possibly create a new gmail account, and pull all of your locally saved contacts, facebook contacts, and other gmail contacts into this new account.\nAfter that I would remove all of your other contacts from your device by going to \nSettings > Contacts > Accounts\nand then removing all of the accounts.\nAfter that I would add your new source of all of your contacts and only use one, to ensure that's where it is coming from.\nPlease reply to this if it is confusing.\nSource: Happened to me before.\n", "Q: Cannot shutdown/restart properly, force-quit fails, wunderlisthelper does not die Alright, I had another initial post draft written, but then I just found something:\nwunderlisthelper will not die...\nkill -9 will cause it to reopen with another pid.\nI keep hard killing it, and it keeps jumping to a new process. \n91617 ??         0:00.55 QA2G25RMZ4.com.wunderkinder.wunderlist-helper\n\nWhat is this?\nThe initial prob is that shutdown/restart will work if not logged in, but will not work if logged into any account.

If that fails - your hardware needs repair. If that succeeds with a clean check - you can set up a new account and/or restore from backup.\nLive repair is not to be trusted, but live errors are of concern. I would try a verify in live mode to be sure you have issues before going to the erase / re-partition step as that can take some time so you'd rather be sure before starting down that path.\n", "Q: Making a Bootable Windows 7 USB without Bootcamp I recently got a macbook pro with the intention of dual booting Windows 7 so that I can play some old games I still have that don't run on anything more recent, and generally access my Steam library. I was frustrated to find that Bootcamp would not allow me to use Windows 7, despite the fact that my laptop is compatible, and therefore set out to create a bootable USB on my own. \nIt's been really, really frustrating. I've searched for a couple hours online, but I must be doing something wrong, because all of the tutorials I can find either do not work, or tell me to use bootcamp - Which won't let me doing what I'm trying to do.\nI have a Windows 7 Iso that I legally downloaded, I have a USB stick with 8 gigs of storage. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to make that USB stick function as a bootable drive, so that my Macbook will let me install Windows.\nAny advice, or links to a tutorial that actually works?\n\nA: Microsoft has a tool for creating a bootable USB stick installer that works with Windows 7, 8 and 10. You can find it here. http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool#installation\nThe caveat is that you will need a windows PC to use the utility.\nNow Bootcamp will do the same thing plus it will put all the right drivers in the installer to be installed with Windows and help you resize the Mac partition and create a Windows partition. You don't technically have to do it that way though. If you open the Boot Camp package there will be a Windows driver installer package you can copy onto your Windows 7 install USB media and then run once you have windows installed.\nNote that you will likely have to re-partition the drive yourself. the Windows 7 installer will not likely resize your Mac partition, you'll probably need one of those Linux bootable \"rescue\" utilities that will let you resize your Mac's partition so you can install Windows in the partition you could create with it.\nIt is not terribly difficult but does require enough computer experience to not mess things up and do everything in the right order.\nOne bit of advice though make a backup image of your Mac's HD before you do anything else. As things going wrong are not unlikely at all.\n\nA: That's because Macs cannot natively read NTFS (what Windows is formatted to) drives.  If you restart in boot mode by holding down the option key it should show up.  If that doesn't work, try installing an NTFS driver tool for Macs and then repeat.\n", "Q: No boot-args in nvram After seeing this question regarding the serverperfmode nvram boot-arg, I thought I would check my server to see its status:\n$ nvram boot-args\nnvram: Error getting variable - 'boot-args': (iokit/common) data was not found\n\nIs this a normal response (i.e., if no boot-args have been set), or is something out of whack with my server.

After looking online I suspected the Power Supply  Unit. I managed to find a replacement PSU (took weeks) but I've just installed it and it hasn't worked the oracle. \nI've tried resetting the SMC (considering it hasn't been plugged in for over a week I believe this is simply a matter of starting the machine up again?). I can't use any utilities as the machine won't boot. Disk is OK, I can read files off it, etc -- the machine isn't even looking for a startup disk!\nAnybody out there got any ideas? I'm getting desparate now -- this machine is my main workhorse!\n\nA: The audible \"pop\" you heard was the magical bubble Apple keeps all the technological goodness in break.  Once it pops, the magic is let out and your Mac will no longer work.\nSeriously though....\nI have personally heard the \"pop\" on many different types of computers - it could be something in your power supply (which you already diagnosed it isn't) to something on the logic board.  \nIt could be a blown or bulging capacitor (left) or a burned out component  (right). (I know the pic on the right is of a PC, but it's an excellent example of both a blown and bulging capacitor in one picture; they go the same way in all electronics, not just Macs)\n\n\nWhat you need to do is start removing components and visually inspecting them.  If you blew something, it would be quite visible.  You would see charring or a physically damaged component.  You are going to have to do some detective work to see what the cause will be and this means you will have to take the Mac down to bare metal.\nOnce you have figured out what it is, you can then figure out what you will need to do to repair it.\n", "Q: General Music/Headphone Help Well, this got put on hold from regular StackExchange for being a general software questing, but I don't know specifics about this.

I find it easier to create Playlists (either on my Phone, or better yet, in iTunes on my Mac,) and and use them instead of playing the entire library.\nHere's some guidance from Apple:\nPlay your music\nIf you want to listen to an artist's entire collection of music that you've saved to your library, find the artist in Library > Artists.

experiencing a similar issue, but this only happens when the Find Navigator is toggled in the navigator area. Try clicking on the Project Navigator or CMD + 1 repeatedly upon launch. Sounds funny but it works.\n\nA: Ok, well I managed to fix this issue by deleting my .xcworkspace directory and recreating it via pod install.  Xcode opens and I'm able to build my project.\nEdit:\nAs others have suggested a better solution is to delete the xcuserdata directory from within .xcworkspace.  This is faster as you don't need to re-run pod install every time.\n\nA: The correct answer is from Lukasz's comment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the file .xcworkspace > Show Package Contents\n\n*Delete the xcuserdata folder\n\n\nAnd now Xcode will open the project workspace just fine. \n\nA: Besides deleting the xcuserdata folder in the project's workspace directory, I was also able to remedy this particular crash by deleting derived data (either for the project that was open while Xcode crashed, or for all projects) at ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData. Last time Xcode crashed I had to do both things to be able to start Xcode again, so I think deleting both is your safest bet (for now at least).\n\nA: *\n\n*yes deleting xcuserdata helps. \n\n*I used to wipe the Derived Data but\nthen it would crash again immediately on Reopen if I tried to do anything\nbefore indexing finished again. \n\n*I noticed that it only happened on a\npersonal project I edited at home and in work. \n\n*The username was\ndifferent on both so I ended up with 2 user entries in xcuserdata my\nwork login username and my home username.\n\n*I notice that both have\nBreakpoints.  \n\n*And the error thrown is\n_IDENavigatorOutlineViewDataSource so its something on the LHS side panels in Xcode? \n\n*Can you add a .ignore for xcuserdata without messing\nup a workspace?\n\n\n\n", "Q: iPhone 3.5mm Audio jack specification (buttons) I have done some research in regards to this but I seem to get conflicting requirements.\nSo Android defines and have published a specification for this.\nhttps://source.android.com/devices/accessories/headset/plug-headset-spec.html\nApple on the other hand, I am unable to find out if they publish this information.\nI have also found out that some Android headset (3 button) does not seem to be compatible with iPhones. \nDoes anybody know what methods Apple iPhone devices use for 3 button detection?\nIs there somewhere a publish specification released?\n\nA: Apple will give you the information to work with/duplicate the \"Headset Remote and Mic\" (aka the little box on each pair of EarPods that have the three buttons and microphone) if you join their MFi program, as noted in the MFi FAQ and on BoingBong when the three-button setup first came out. I haven't seen anyone online reverse-engineer it and publish information about how it works.\n", "Q: Moving Messages History from Macbook to iPad Mini I have my messages synced with my iPad Mini and computer, but I've had the computer longer and I want to copy my message history from my computer over to my iPad. What's the easiest way to do this?\n\nA: Follow these steps to back up and restore Messages (and other app data) from one iPhone to another:\n1. Connect the old iPhone to a power source and turn on Wi-Fi.\n2. On the old iPhone - assuming you're running iOS 8 or later - tap Settings > iCloud > Backup. The Backup switch is near the bottom of the large group of controls. (On iOS 7 or earlier, you should tap Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup.)\n3. Make sure iCloud Backup is turned on.\n\n\n*Tap Back Up Now, and wait for the backup process to complete. You'll need to remain connected to Wi-Fi for the entirety of this process.\n\n*Turn on your new iPhone. If you haven't done so already, you'll need to go through the setup process. When asked, tap Restore from iCloud Backup and Next. If you've already been through the setup process, you'll need to reset your iPhone. Tap on Settings > General > Reset and > Erase All Content and Settings.\n\n*Enter your Apple ID and Password.\n\n", "Q: Contact card spam I'm getting contact cards in my Contacts.app that have the Apple logo, a name like \"Apple inc.\" Or \"Expedia\" and then hundreds of emails listed under that contact.\nI suspect this is someone trying to make me think they are Apple or Expedia when I view their emails, since their email address will be replaced with \"Apple inc.\" When I view it in Mail.app.\nCould this be a bug? What should I do? They seem to just come back after I delete them, but it's a real hassle to delete them since they freeze contacts.app because of the hundreds/thousands of email fields.\nThese are local contacts on a Mac running Yosemite. Here's a photo: https://imgur.com/a/WjMOs\n\nA: I think you may have used the Contacts app's \"Look for Duplicates\" command. In my experience, contact cards that do not have first or last names are seen as duplicates of each other. If you choose to merge the \"duplicate\" contacts all data from the cards with no first or last name will merge into one card. It's definitely not the way to go! \nHere is the wording in the Contacts app after you do \"Look for Duplicates:\" \n\"Duplicate cards that have the same name but contain different information, and cards containing duplicated information, were found. Do you want to merge duplicate cards and the duplicated information?\" (emphasis by me).\nI would call this either a bug or bad decision-making in the Contacts app. I would simply not use the Look for Duplicates command in Contacts as it can really cause trouble. \n", "Q: Is the iOS image saved by iTunes for restoring the same for all iPhone models? If you restore an iPhone 6 with iTunes, iTunes will first download the iOS image and then it will restore the iPhone.\nI wonder if this same iOS image will be good for a different iPhone model, such as an iPhone 5 or would it need to download a specific image for iPhone 5?.\n\nA: Each individual model requires its own restore file, known as an IPSW [iPhone software] file.\nThat also applies even to slightly different versions of the same model,. such as the US SIM & non-SIM versions of the same phone.\nYou can see them listed at sites such as https://ipsw.me - which is just a list of redirects to the actual Apple downloads.\nIf you have a poor connection, or need the exact same download for more than one iPhone on more than one computer, you can get them via these links, then manually drop into place. They live in ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates\n", "Q: `ulimit -n` for non-root I'm running El Capitan / Mac OSX 10.11.6 (15G1108) and I want to increase the \"Max Open files\" for some of my terminals / bash sessions. I'm logged in with my normal users. I read through all the guides I could find and managed to increase some limits:\nAs my user:\n$ launchctl limit maxfiles\n    maxfiles    200000         200000        \n\nBut, when I try to set the limit, I fail:\n$ ulimit -n 8096\n-bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\nThe strange thing is that I actually can set the ulimit if I switch to root:\n$ sudo bash\n$ ulimit -n 9086\n\nNow of course, running everything as root is stupid, so I'm searching for a better solution. How can I allow my user to also increase his \"Max Files Limit\"?\nWhat I have done already:\n$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf\nkern.maxfiles=65536\nkern.maxfilesperproc=65536\n\n$ cat /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n  <plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n      <key>Label</key>\n        <string>limit.maxfiles</string>\n      <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n          <string>launchctl</string>\n          <string>limit</string>\n          <string>maxfiles</string>\n          <string>200000</string>\n          <string>200000</string>\n        </array>\n      <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n      <key>ServiceIPC</key>\n        <false/>\n    </dict>\n  </plist>\n\n\nA: Having had this exact same problem, I ultimately found that my bash startup sequence (.bashrc or similar) was doing a ulimit -n 1024; and that caused both the soft and the hard limit to get set; the latter of which prevented any attempt at raising it afterwards, giving rise to the \"bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\" error.\nSo, removing that command got the soft and hard limits restored to the apparent system defaults of 256 and unlimited respectively. The latter is what will enable you to ulimit -n <whatever> again.\nIn your case, assuming the cause is similar and your Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist is still in place as listed, I expect that ulimit -Sn and ulimit -Hn will report both to be 200000.\n\nA: For me on macOS Mojave, I had to set both:\n.bash_profile\nulimit -n 65536\n\n.bashrc\nulimit -n 65536\n\nIf you only set from profile you can only increase from 256 to 1024.\nIt’s weird because there is not so much info about this online, I wonder how developers manage without it.\n", "Q: Open URL as File If I go to an application and open a file, such as using Cmd-O, is there some way to enter a URL, so that I can open a file directly from the web?\nFor example, in a graphics application, I would like to open an image file directly from the URL without having first to save it from the browser.\nI know I can point to a local path using Cmd-G.\n\nA: No, there's no generic way of doing that in every application on macOS.\nSome specific applications provide a way of opening a URL - for example VLC Player allows you to open a URL and play a video directly from the web.\n", "Q: What does \"unauthorized attacks\" mean in the iOS Security Guide? First of all, are there authorized attacks?\nI'm a beginner iOS developer and I just started reading the Apple's security guide and almost chocked on my sandwich.\nDoes this not imply that my app's data (or my personal data for that matter) can be accessed with these \"authorized attacks\"?\n\n\nA: Yes, if you authorize someone to \"attack\" your iOS device - that would be an authorized \"attack\".\nThis is not so far-fetched or unrealistic as it sounds. Many companies do purchase services from security vendors to do authorized \"attacks\" on their servers and devices in order to ensure that they have sufficient security. \nHowever, you're reading too much into the text if you think that it states that an authorized attack will succeed just because it is authorized. That doesn't make any sense.\nSo all in all, nothing new, nothing to be alarmed about, and nothing that is specific for iOS devices which is not true of any other device.\n", "Q: What happens if I plug a 2016 MacBook Pro into itself? The charging cable on the 2016 MacBook Pro is USB-C both ways, allowing me to plug the MacBook into itself. What happens if I do this?\n\nA: The new MacBook Pros have circuitry in all USB-C ports so that the charger can be plugged into any port. \nPlugging a two-way USB-C cable will just make the device think that it's charging as technically there is a power source coming from one of the ports into the other.\nIt doesn't actually charge anything but the reporting is what's making the battery icon show 'charging'. \n\nA: I tried it to plug the macbook pro 2019 or 2020 (not M1) into it self, showed charging and seemed fine so I undid the connection left it running on my desk came back 2 hours later and now it wont start, so I tried charging it for 2 hours, then I tried all the key combinations with no affect.  About to call apple care will post when I learn more. So more detailed information of circumstances and what I have already tried. My charging cable was getting worn out on near the ports so I put on swapped it with a new C to C just incase it was just a bad charging cable, did not help and I have a firmware password so probably explains why none of the keyboard tricks work and finally I scanned the SSD from my other macbook using a thunderbolt 2 dongle to usb c with no errors in diskutility.\n\nA: We just tried it with my friends laptop\nIt charges itself (well... it thinks it does)\n\nA: It probably will detect it as a short circuit and shut down. I would not do it, if I were you.\n", "Q: Remotely control a Mac's keyboard from another Mac, without network I have a few Macs running as servers, in a remote location.\nUsually, I control them using Screen Sharing or Timbuktu.\nSometimes, e.g. when performing some system updates, the Mac does not start up fully, so that the Mac is not reachable over the network, yet.\nUsing a video digitizer, I can send the Mac's video output to another Mac in order to be able to see what the problem might be.\nBut I also need to be able to perform keyboard input on the stuck Mac. What are my options for this?\nI've read about programs such as Type2Phone, which might be able to simulate a Bluetooth keyboard that the other Mac can then connect to. Not sure if that works. At least one of my Macs is a PPC Mac running OSX 10.5, so I am also looking for alternatives, such as a wired (USB) keyboard connection I can control from another Mac. Is there anything available like that?\nAny other ideas? I guess there must be some solution for Macs installed in co-location centers that allow such kind of remote control, especially if the Mac somehow screwed up its network settings or is getting freshly installed.\n\nA: The usual way to solve this is using a KVM-over-IP switch (Keyboard-Video-Mouse). This is a general solution that works with almost any type of computer - PC, Mac, whatever.\nKVM switches comes in many forms and price ranges from many brands such as for example Raritan, Avocent, Aten, etc. Most have for example 12 or 24 RJ45 connectors where you plugin a normal network cable. You connect an adapter to the far end of the cable. The adapter will provide for example USB and DVI, PS/2 and VGA or similar connectors that you plugin to the computer you want to remotely control. \nCheaper KVMs also exist that uses USB or proprietary cabling, provides fewer ports, etc. \nYou can then from your desktop PC at any location connect to the KVM switch over the network and control keyboard/mouse and see what's on the remote computer's display. Some KVM switches also allow you to create a virtual DVD-drive or floppy-drive over USB that allows you to remotely install operating systems, etc.\nYou mention co-location centers and they normally use KVM switches for this purpose. However, modern servers usually have built-in management controller using a seperate processor on the mainboard with its own network interface (or piggy-backing on an existing interface). This management controller usually gives you a web interface (or IPMI interface) for remotely controlling the server including video and mouse/keyboard. Usually they also let you power on/off the server and sometimes also providing virtual DVD or floppy drives.\nHere's links to different KVM-over-IP products:\nCheaper range:\n1-port Lantronix Spider KVM (299.99$ on newegg)\n8-port Avocent DSR1021 (389$ on newegg)\n1-port Raritan KX II-101 (373$)\n32-port Raritan DKX3-232 (3.895$)\n16-port Aten CS1716I (661$)\n", "Q: Unmount fails with: \"failed to clean up smb mountpoint(s)\" I have mounted an SMB share and I want to disconnect, but CMD-E just dims the share disk symbol on the desktop but never completes.\nSystem log says:\n  förval    10:09:00.748510 +0100   lsd SecTranslocate: DiskArbitration callback: failed to clean up mountpoint(s) related to volume: /Volumes/myshare\n\nWhat could be the reason?\nHow can it be avoided?\nIf I logout, the share is back in the desktop when I log in again.\nTo get rid of it, I have to reboot.\n\nA: My guess is some program is still using files on the share.\nYou could see what programming is using files on your share by running the folling line from the command line:\nlsof | grep \"/Volumes/yourshare/\"\n\n", "Q: How can I avoid data mangling in filenames when copying files between Linux and macOS? When we transported a CMS filesystem and mysql dump via rsync from one Linux server to another Linux server, we used a MacOS in the middle to store the data temporarily. After the CMS was up on the other Linux server, all static image files where available. But all filenames with German umlauts where not to be found by the CMS, although they where visible and accessible. We quickly found out, that exactly this happens: \nWhen I create a filename with German umlauts on Linux like this:\nlinux$ mkdir umlauttest\nlinux$ touch umlauttest/äöü\n\nAnd then go to a Mac and issue there an rsync to copy the directory to my Mac...\nmac$ rsync -a user@linux:umlauttest .\n\nAnd then copy it back from my Mac to Linux:\nmac$ rsync -a umlauttest/. user@linux:umlauttest2\n\nThen I have really a problem on my Linux, because the filename is kind of broken.\nlinux$ diff umlauttest umlauttest2\nOnly in umlauttest2: äöü\nOnly in umlauttest: äöü\n\nThat is, because MacOS is in fact converting the filename characters to composite Unicode characters, which is really something I call mangling meta data. This behaviour also arises by using scp to copy files.\nIs there a way to prevent this from happening?\n\nA: Use the --iconv option for rsync to specify how filenames are encoded on the local and remote hosts - this might help you in keeping the filenames intact.\nWhen you copy from the Linux server to the Mac add the following to the rsync command:\n--iconv=utf-8,utf-8-mac \n\nWhen copying from the Mac to the Linux server use the following:\n--iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 \n\nNote that you need a relatively new version of rsync (>3.0) to have the --iconv option. Apple supplies only an old version so you need to go to another site e.g. a package manager like Macports or Homebrew\n", "Q: Dell external monitor has blurry font I have a Dell S2316H monitor which I connect to my MacBook Pro (early 2015) using the built in HDMI port.

I do not have any DVI port on my monitor so I can't use the solution from External display has blurry fonts on Dell U2312hm- MacBook Pro Retina.

Is there really any solution for this problem?\n\nA: Unfortunately, that's normal. MacOS cannot display sharp UI when connected to a 23 Inch HD monitor. You have a built-in retina display which is 220 ppi. On the other hand, the monitor you are using is only 95 ppi. \nI had a similar experience with a HP ZR 24W, which is a 24 inch 1920x1200 display. I have tried this monitor using both HDMI and DisplayPort (thunderbolt), results were the same. Therefore, I don't believe your problem is related to the interface, since macbook pro 2015 can easily do 60hz 1920x1080 from its HDMI port. \nThere are some ways to make text sharpness somewhat better by playing with text smoothing parameters (see this article), however you can only go so far with it. \nThe real solution for you is to switch to a display which has more pixel density. One that will let MacOS to use the HiDPI retina resolutions. For that, a 24 inch or 27 inch 4K display will be an affordable choice. \nYou can read my answer to a related question for more details. \nHope that helps. \n", "Q: How to install macOS on a encrypted, journaled filesystem? I just wiped my 500GB disk on my Mac Mini (2011 model) to freshly reinstall macOS Sierra.\n\n*\n\n*I restarted the system, pressed CMD+R to get into recovery mode and went into disk utility.\n\n*I erased the macOS partition and formatted it with journaled and encrypted file-system. Picked a password, and good.\n\n*I quit the disk utility and selected 'Install macOS'.\n\nThis told me it will check eligibility of my device and due to my encrypted disk it will ask for the password during installation. And it did. I entered the password and the process continued until at some point it aborted with the following message:\n\nmacOS could not be installed on your computer.\nStorage system verify or repair failed.\n\nNow my only option is reboot and remove the encryption via disk utility. I was not able to install macOS onto a fully encrypted disk. Is this desired behaviour? How to install macOS on a encrypted, journaled file-system?\nI'm usually installing my Linux systems on fully encrypted disks, thus I am wondering whether this is also possible with macOS Sierra.\n\nA: I know you have a working answer already, but I thought to share my experience anyway, only updated for High Sierra and using Apple's new file system APFS.\nMy motivation: I was driven by the (constantly varying) 6-14 hour estimate for FileVault to finish on a new install with no additional user data.\nSo this is what I did to install macOS on an already-encrypted filesystem - much like yours:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable macOS installer\n\n*Erase and format as APFS (Encrypted)\n\n*Install High Sierra\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*< 10 mins to encrypt by Disk Utility? (possibly less, I didn't monitor closely)\n\n*FileVault already enabled.\n\n\nOne main difference is that you supply a password earlier when formatting with Disk Utility, rather than being given one (the Recovery Key) when enabling FileVault post-install.\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: I just did this so I know it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the target disk \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" - but not encrypted.   \n\n*Install macOS Sierra on the fresh, unencrypted disk.  \n\n*Finally, turn on disk encryption (called FileVault).  This can be done near the end of installing Sierra (it prompts you if you want encryption), or after the install is done.  Either way is fine.\n\n\nIf you do it in this sequence then everything works.\nA few other thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would also recommend to format it the disk as a single partition.  I have had issues with disks formatted with multiple partitions when using encryption on one or more of the partitions.  Perhaps that bug has been fixed now, but I don't know so I would not risk it.\n\n*After you enable encryption, wait for the encryption process to finish before installing other software or making big changes.  You can see the progress of the disk encryption by going to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> FileVault.  The encryption process is disk intensive so it is best to just let if finish before doing other disk intensive things.\n\n*For non boot partitions, it is fine to format them as encrypted - e.g. Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted).  It is only bootable partitions that need to follow the above sequence to avoid trouble.\n\n\nA: A thumb drive installer solved it for me. Thanks to comment by Stuart H. \nDownload the macOS Sierra installer.\nType (or copy and paste) this command into Terminal, replacing Untitled with the name of your drive, then press Enter: \n\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app --nointeraction && say Done\n\nHold option key at power up & select attached thumb drive device to boot. \nAs necessary, run Disk Utility to erase & format the destination drive to the journaled, encrypted option and then proceed with install to the destination drive.\nRef: http://lifehacker.com/how-to-make-a-bootable-macos-sierra-usb-flash-drive-1786853248\n\nA: I've had this error happen when the partition previously contained a FileVault-encrypted macOS installation.  Reformatting as encrypted in Disk Utility and reinstalling macOS fails shortly after entering the disk password after the reboot, as you described.\nHowever, I found that it works if you format as unencrypted, install macOS, then go back to recovery, reformat as encrypted, and install again.\nIt's sort of an awkward workaround, and there might be a simpler solution, but that's what worked for me.  My guess is that there's some information about the old FileVault setup in NVRAM or something that doesn't get cleared out when you reformat with Disk Utility, and it confuses the newly-installed system that's booting from a partition with different encryption settings.  Booting from an unencrypted partition apparently clears out that old FileVault data, which paves the way for a new encrypted installation later.\n", "Q: What do I need to do to get my Mac to sleep properly?

You will need a dev account though (99$/year...), since self-signed apps cant access all macOS SDKs functionalities, touchID is (possibly) not accessible without signing. \n", "Q: Strange \"open with\" option in Safari I have two applications on my Mac that will open DICOM files: OsiriX and Horos.\nIn response to a download and display request in Safari, I get the message shown in this screenshot:\nhttp://207.254.60.104/WebShare/OpenHoros/OpenHoros.png\nThe request is: \nosirix://?methodName=DownloadURL&Display=YES&URL='http://207.254.60.XXX:3333/wado?requestType=WADO&studyUID=1.2.826.0.1.3680043.9.5830.1.XXX&token=5EA4A2D69BC4AA5BB4A2CD303B7FE041'\n\n(XXXs for anonymization purposes)\nIt previously would simply download the data into Osirix and display them. Now, suddenly, I get the option to open the data with Horos only.\nThis doesn't happen with Chrome.\nUpdate 12/22/16: It's happening with Chrome, too. Chrome opens the Horos app.\n\nSecond update: 12/22/16\nFirefox Preferences still permits explicit specification of Applications. When I checked this, I got the following:\nhttp://dsh.re/4893b\n\nI changed this to \"OsiriX\" which has solved the issue for that browser. So, I've confirmed that \"something\" has set Horos.app as a Default. I just have to determine how to change that.\nIdeas?\n\nA: Have you tried downloading a DICOM file locally and then right clicking -> open with -> Other and then choosing Osirix and checking always use this app? I've had to do this before once; somehow OS X file associations got overwritten after an upgrade. \n\nA: I used RCDefault.app to fix this. Yes, Horos was listed as the URL Handler for OsiriX. I don't know how this came to be.\nI confirm that RCDefault does work in macOSSierra (10.12.2) — at least for this purpose. (I read somewhere that it wasn't working in Sierra.)\n", "Q: iPhone, so many wifi points, mine won't appear in the list! I have a wireless USB drive that I sometimes need to connect to, but most of the time it is disabled.  When I turn it on and try to connect my iPhone to it, it won't even show up in the list of available networks because my neighborhood has so many (dozens) access points!  iOS seems to list a maximum of 6 at any one time.\nThere appears to be no way to completely ignore certain networks and force iOS to skip past them, and also no way to \"whitelist\" certain networks so that they always appear in the list of available networks.  I know I can choose \"Other\" and manually connect to it every time, but I have a very long, strong password and typing it in every time on the phone is a huge pain.\nIs there any way to make my iPhone find this network when it is turned on?  It does show up occasionally, but it's basically dumb luck.\n\nA: If you can see the connection OK from your Mac, then try elevating its priority - which you can't do from the phone, but is simple on the Mac.\nSystem Prefs > Network > WiFi > Advanced...\nYou can drag access points into a preferred order. If you move your WiFi to the top of the list, this should then sync to your iPhone & it ought to then choose that as its preferred connection.\n\nA: This is an incredibly obnoxious bug in iOS (and macOS) wifi network selection: basically the neighboring networks, which you have no interest in, fill up the wifi list so you don't see your own network which you actually want to connect to!\nI've seen many unhelpful non-solutions to this problem such as \"turn off automatic connection\" or \"change the wifi network priority list\" or \"reset your network preferences\" or etc.. None of these \"solutions\" fixes the root problem which is that the iPhone simply doesn't display all of the networks and frequently picks the wrong ones to display.\nBecause Apple's wifi control panel on iOS (and the wifi menu on macOS) truncates the list of available wifi networks to a small list, it means that if there are dozens of networks in the area it is basically a crap shoot as to whether your desired network will show up. The noise drowns out the signal. You can't make the list longer. You can't blacklist networks you never want to see. You can't adjust it to \"show all\" or \"show my preferred networks at the top of the list\" or some other (currently nonexistent) setting in order to actually see your network. Instead you just have to keep refreshing and hope it shows up. This is a serious and annoying bug that Apple needs to fix, because there really is no consistent and reliable workaround as of iOS 12.1 at least.\n\nA: Have you tried disabling the Ask to join networks function?\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Tap on Wi-Fi\n\n*Toggle the Ask to Join Networks option off\n\n*Exit Settings\n\n*Connect to your USB drive (you may need to do this manually)\n\n\nHopefully you should find that in future your USB drive will appear as a known network, while all the other neighbourhood ones won't.\n\nA: I found it lists WiFi in lexical order.\nHere is a trick\n\n\n*\n\n*rename you WiFi SSID to start from A (or some symbol maybe?)\n\n", "Q: command line in AppleScript I want to create an AppleScript app with this perfectly working (bash) command:\ncd /Volumes/MEDIAS/WORK/CONVERSION_VIDEO/PROXY_720P/INPUT/; for f in *.mov *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vcodec prores -profile:v 0 -s 1280x720 /Volumes/MEDIAS/WORK/CONVERSION_VIDEO/PROXY_720P/OUTPUT/\"${f%.*}_PROXY_720P.mov\" && rm \"$f\"; done\n\nbut I get errors with the variable \"$f\".\nHow can I launch it through AppleScript?\n\nA: Shell scripts/commands in AppleScript are handled with the do shell script command, which executes a shell script using the sh shell. In the short form of:\ndo shell script \"...\"\n\nWhere ... is the shell script to execute.\nSee AppleScript Language Guide do shell script Commands Reference and Technical Note TN2065 do shell script in AppleScript, for additional details.\nWhat you need to do, is escape the double-quotes with a backslash, e.g. \\\"$f\\\" and elsewhere as necessary.\nI've tested your command, wrapped in a do shell script command, with the necessary escaping as shown in the command below and it worked without issue.\ndo shell script \"cd /Volumes/MEDIAS/WORK/CONVERSION_VIDEO/PROXY_720P/INPUT/; for f in *.mov *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \\\"$f\\\" -vcodec prores -profile:v 0 -s 1280x720 /Volumes/MEDIAS/WORK/CONVERSION_VIDEO/PROXY_720P/OUTPUT/\\\"${‌​f%.*}_PROXY_720P.mov‌​\\\" && rm \\\"$f\\\"; done\"\n\nNote: Because the do shell script command uses the sh shell, if the ffmpeg executable is not in the PATH passed to the shell, which is /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin, you'll need to include the fully qualified pathname to the ffmpeg executable for your command to work in AppleScript.\n\nA: The direct parameter of the do shell script command is a string containing the shell code you want to execute, as demonstrated in Listing 39-1, which simply lists a directory.\nAPPLESCRIPT\nOpen in Script Editor\nListing 39-1AppleScript: Executing a simple shell command that lists the contents of a directory\ndo shell script \"ls /Applications/\"\n(*\n--> Result:\n\"App Store.app\nAutomator.app\nCalculator.app\nCalendar.app\n...\"\n*)\n\n", "Q: How can I sync movies from iTunes to my iPad? I cannot figure out how to sync movies that I have bought on iTunes onto my iPad. The first problem is that one of the two movies I bought does not even show up in the screen and the other gives a message that the movie is \"not authorized\" for this device. Below I have included screen shots.\n\n\nAs you can see in the second image, the second movie that I just bought \"Stranger than Fiction\" does not even show up in the sync menu.\n\nA: The problem is that when you buy a movie it is not immediately downloaded to your machine. You have to explicitly tell iTunes to downloading by going to your \"Library\", selecting Movies from the left panel, right-clicking on the new movie and selecting \"Download\". Once the download starts you will see a screen like this:\n\nThe button next to the search box in the upper right will show the download status. Once the download is complete, click sync button which is the small rectangle next to the media type combo box in the upper left. (This button is right below the \"Account\" menu in the screen shot above.) Your new movie should appear grayed out (as shown in the screenshot below). Then, select \"Movies\" from the left hand navigation pane (iPad submenu), make sure that the checkbox for syncing your movies is selected, and press the Sync button to start the transfer to the iPad.\n\n\nA: You need to authorise it if it's the first time you're syncing your iPad.\nThis support documentation by Apple shows how it can be done.\nBasically, you need to sign in to your Apple ID, then go to Account > Authorizations > Authorize This Computer.\n\nA: Make sure that you are signed into the correct ID on the iPad - the one with which you bought the movie. Make sure that you have nothing restricted for content in Settings>General>Restrictions and make sure that you selected the movie to sync.\nConnect the iPad to the computer and launch iTunes.\nClick on the iPad name on the left side under devices.\n1.Click on the Movies Tab on the right.\n2.Click on/select the movie that you want to sync..\n3.Click on the Sync Movies Heading.\n4.Click on Apply in the lower right corner of iTunes\n", "Q: Deleting symbolic link - operation not permitted I stupidly used my terminal to create a symbolic link typing this:\nsudo ln -s /bin/tcsh tcsh\n\nAnd now I need to delete it. I tried\nsudo rm tcsh\n\nbut when I authenticate it tells me:\noverride rwxr-xr-x root/wheel restricted,compressed for tcsh?\n\nand even if I type y and press enter it tells me:\nrm: tcsh: Operation not permitted.\n\nIs there anything I can do to fix this? \n\nA: It seems you are either trying to remove your original file /bin/tcsh or another tcsh copied to a different path. You can't link /bin/tcsh to tcsh if you are in the /bin folder because that's forbidden.\nA soft link of tcsh usually isn't protected by SIP and you have to search for it and delete it. If you somehow managed to copy tcsh to another path, which then prevents a software you are using from working, you may have to delete it there.\nTo remove a protected tcsh copy, boot to Recovery Mode, disable SIP, reboot to your main volume and remove the link.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down Command+R until the Apple logo appears on your screen.\n\n*Click Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*In the Terminal window, type in csrutil disable and press Enter.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n*Remove the tcsh copy\n\n*Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode\n\n*Click Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*In the Terminal window, type in csrutil enable and press Enter.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n\nLink: How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA “rootless” on OS X 10.11, El Capitan?

I am just worried that someone might have access to my files. I have checked the sharing options but everything is unchecked, how do I remove this mystery computer from my shared computer section?\n\nA: Your Mac is just letting you know another device on the network is advertising some sort of SMB share. It could be a printer with a card reader, it could be a legitimate PC sharing a printer or a folder on the disk, or it could be some sort of appliance or internet of things device.\nIf you log in to your router, you can see each other device and power them off one by one. Once you know what's causing the \"mystery\" share - you can either investigate limiting it's configuration or removing it from the network.\nIt's not a security risk or a virus on your Mac.\n", "Q: Second Macbook Pro as extended display I have an old Macbook Pro 15\". My company gave me a new Macbook Pro 13\".\nQuestion, is there a way to use either of them as extended display to the other one ?\nBoth support retina display.\n\nA: There is no built-in Apple way to do this. Your only option would be to use third party software such as Air Display. However, I cannot vouch for how well it will work in your scenario.\n", "Q: Yosemite migration assistant locks on start, no way to boot anything else I have a 2011 MBP Yosemite development 2011 machine that will not upgrade cleanly to Sierra, too many weird tools installed there I suppose. So I got another MBP from the same era, wiped the drive, installed Sierra, and planned to use Migration Assistant to move what I could. I plugged in an Ethernet cable, set the new machine as destination, and started the Yosemite Migration Assistant on the old machine, thinking to use it as the source. However, it hung on start and I cannot restart the machine to anything but the same Migration Assistant screen.\nI tried rebooting with option key down to pick the drive, but it showed me two of my boot drive, neither one works, then I did recovery boot and fixed the boot drive. Then I did the reset PRAM boot three times in a row. Nothing gets me past the locked up Migration Assistant. When I boot I see a flash of the normal start, then it goes to a screen that says:\nTransferring you information\nFinishing you Migration\n\nThis Mac\nStarting up...\n\nAny idea on how I can get my disk to skip this switch to Migration Assistant on boot? The reason I was doing this today was that last night my Time Machine drive failed and I could not recover it and I thought to migrate to a different machine immediately instead of waiting for a new drive to arrive so that I'd be on two drives and upgraded to Sierra. So, I lost my Time Machine backups and cannot recover that. I suppose I can just pull the drive and put it in an enclosure and recover what I can, but I'd really like to be able to boot normally and make a full backup.\n\nA: I used Disk Utility from recovery to clone the boot drive as an emergency backup since I no longer had a working time machine backup. When it finished it rebooted half way, glitched the screen and then went back to a normal boot up and I could access the machine as usual. All ok so far.\nI suspect that it had something to do with connecting an Ethernet cable to a Yosemite machine while trying to do a migration. I'll not do that again.\n", "Q: Spotlight search result for contact does not open found contact in Address Book When I search for a contact in Spotlight (Cmd-Space), the correct contacts show.\nWhen I select a contact (Enter), Address Book opens, but it has no contact selected.

Apple does not provide any mechanism for changing the functionality of the double tap.\nIf the device is jailbroken, you can install Activator 1.9.11 beta 2 which has support for the ‘Double Press’ Touch ID event. This event can be mapped to ‘Home Button’, such that ‘touch fingerprint sensor twice’ will ‘simulate a press of the home button’.\n", "Q: MacBook Air crashes when plugging in Android devices For the past few days, developing on an Android device has been a nightmare on my MacBook Air (mid-2013) model.

This happens regardless of whether the invitees have iCloud addresses or not (in most cases, for me, all invitees are iCloud users).\nI con reproduce this 100% of the time on both macOS and iOS. This error suddenly appeared recently, and since then I've learned from several friends that they have experienced the same problem.\nHow do I send invitations to events with locations from Calendar?\n\nA: This turns out to be a known bug.

There, you’ll be able to name your event, as well as add a location if you'd like.\n\n*Then you can designate start and end times for your event, as well as add any notes for your invitees to see. You can also choose which of your Calendars the event will go in.\n\n*(If you can't see the Invitees tab, go to Settings, iCloud, and make sure Calendar is turned on. If you're still not seeing the Invitees tab, make sure you’re putting the event in one of your iCloud calendars.)\n\n*Tapping the Invitees tab will allow you to choose individuals from your contacts to invite, provided you have their email address in their contact card.

I'm thinking about making some videos that will need to be recorded from my iPhone and using them in a common, Twitch-like setup where the phone's display is in one region, and a webcam, or other graphics, are displayed around the iOS stream.  I've read that others partially achieve this by using QuickTime Pro to record.  QuickTime Pro integrated a feature where you could start recording from a connected iOS device and that would work perfectly for my scenario.\nBut this isn't the answer.  I don't have QuickTime Pro, so I went to see about purchasing a license.  Googling \"QuickTime Pro\" with a couple other modifiers hasn't shown me anything of use and even the buy links from Apples own page seem to be broken.\nOn the Apple support forums, I saw another user ask where to get a key for QT Pro, and someone responded that a security flaw was found in the Windows version and that Apple has since stopped selling licenses.\nSo, what's the best alternative?  Specifically, is there an Apple-branded alternative that will allow me to stream/record from my iOS device to my macOS?\n\nA: If you want to record videos from your iPhone, you can use the normal QuickTime Player to achieve that.\nJust connect your iPhone to your Mac, open QuickTime Player and follow the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on 'File' in the menu\n\n*Select 'New Movie Recording'\n\n*Click on the small downward-pointing arrow beside the record button\n\n\n*\n\n*\n\n\n*Click on your phone's name under 'Camera'\nIf you want to record the sound from your iPhone, select your phone's name under 'Microphone' too.

I am developing a program in go; it occasionally ends up allocating very large amounts memory (>>10G on a machine with 8G of physical memory), causing the system to become unresponsive.  I want to limit the amount of memory the process can allocate.  The usual way I would do this is:\nulimit -m 4000000 ; ./myprogram\n...which should kill my program if it tries to use more than 4GB of memory.\nOn OS X El Capitan this appears to have no effect; even ulimit -m 1 (limiting all programs to just 1kB of memory!) is ineffective.\nHow can I set an upper bound on the memory available to a particular process?\n\nA: There are two approaches to constraining your memory usage: Ex post facto, and preemptive. That is to say, you can try to kill your program after it has gotten too large, or you can program it not to get too large in the first place. \nIf you insist on the ex post facto approach, you can use the following Bash script. This script first finds the amount of memory (as defined by \"resident set size\") the process with processid pid is using, filters out all non numerical data using grep, and saves the amount as variable n. The script then checks if n is greater than your specified x. If it is, the process with processid pid is killed.\nPlease note:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must replace <pid> with the process id of your program. \n\n*You must replace <x> with the rss = \"resident set size\" (ie real memory size) you don't want the program to exceed.  \n\n\nn=$(ps -<pid> -o rss | grep '[0-9]')\nif [ $n -gt <x> ]; then  kill -9 <pid>; fi\nIf you want this to run every y seconds just inclose it in a loop, and tell it to wait for y seconds after every iteration. You could also write a similar command using top. Your starting point would be top -l 1|grep \"<pid>\"|awk '{print $10}'.\n@kenorb's answer helped me with my script\n\nWhile I believe that answers the question, in the long run I believe it is better programming design to take a preemptive approach using manual memory allocation. \nFirstly, are you sure the memory usage is really a problem? The Go documentation states: \n\nThe Go memory allocator reserves a large region of virtual memory as an arena for allocations. This virtual memory is local to the specific Go process; the reservation does not deprive other processes of memory.\n\nIf you still think you have a problem, then I encourage you to manually manage your memory as is done in the C programming language. Since go is written in C, I suspected there would be ways to get into the C memory management/allocations, and indeed there are. See this github repository which,\n\nallows you to do manual memory management via the standard C allocator for your system. It is a thin wrapper on top of malloc, calloc and free from . See man malloc for details on these functions for your system. This library uses cgo.\n\nThe use case is given as:\n\nWhy would you want this?\nWhen a program is causing memory pressure or the system is running out of memory it can be helpful to manually control memory allocations and deallocations. Go can help you control allocations but it is not possible to explicitly deallocate unneeded data.\n\nThis seems like a better long term solution.\nIf you want to learn more about C (including memory management), \nThe C Programming language is the standard reference.\n", "Q: Date format for file's \"Modified\" and \"Last opened\" is different than other files I have a few files in the same folder and I noticed that the format for the Modified and Last opened metadata fields are the \"short\" format for most files and the \"medium\" format for just a few.

One monitor is on my standing desk and the other is directly on the table (at sitting level.)

After entering in my username and password, I see three shared folders: Macintosh HD, User's Public Folder, and User. \nIn other words, even though I thought I am only sharing my public folder, the entirety of my hard drive can be accessed by the other computer.\nThe settings I have in Sharing seem normal. SMB and AFP are checked (default). I also have enabled \"Windows File Sharing.\"\nWhy is so much access given away?\n\nA: When you connect to your computer (presumably) as yourself you will see absolutely everything on the computer as you are the owner. If you want people to connect to your computer and only see certain folders you will have to create local users that only have access to the folders that you assign them rights to.\nIt works the same way on Windows and Linux: you control access to folders (and the files within them) by assigning various users specific rights to specific folders.\nLet's say you have two folders on your Mac \"Accounting\" and \"Pictures.\" You only want your sister to access the Accounting folder because she takes care of your finances and that is where you put the spreadsheets and receipts that enumerate your finances and expenses. So you create an account for \"sister\" on your Mac and add her to the list of users who have access to that folder (which will be you (the owner of the Mac) and your sister).\nBut you want your brother, mom and dad to view the pictures and only the pictures. So you create three accounts (called brother, mom, dad) and add them to the list of users that have access to that folder.\nEach user needs their own password (which you assign when you create the account) and a username which can be as above or uses their name, your choice.\nAnd then when they need to access the files they log in with their username and password and only have access to the folders that you assigned them rights to.\nThat is a \"10 mile view\" of file sharing. I've not gone into details as there are lots of tutorials out there (you will have to learn how to use Google for this) that tell you in detail how to do file sharing on the Mac. But this gives you an outline of the process.\nFor a newbie it is annoyingly complicated, for someone who does system administration for a living, it's second nature and easy.\n", "Q: How do I turn off News notifications on my Apple Watch? Recently I started seeing News notifications on my Apple Watch:\n\nI've confirmed that News is turned off in the Watch app on my iPhone under Notifications:\n\nBut I keep getting the notifications. I've tried turning News notifications on, and then off again. But I keep getting them.\nAm I unaware of some other necessary setting that will disable these notifications?\n\nA: Actually I was having the same problem and discovered why. In the News app itself there are some notification settings. Why it's so obscure and hard to find is unlike Apple, but it's there all the same.\nGo to the News app and tap on the Favorites tab. At the very top you'll see three things: a bell gliph, a Favorites option (for sorting), and an Edit button. Tap on the bell gliph. It's for configuring the notifications.\n\nFrom there it's pretty self explanatory. You can turn on or off all notifications right there. It doesn't explicitly say Apple Watch notifications, but they are somehow intrinsically connected. I disabled all of them and it stopped harassing me on my watch.\nThey really should make the notification options separate for iOS and the watch. Seems dumb how I have to go in to a place that makes no sense just to turn off stuff.\nIncidentally you can also stop the annoying barrage of default news sources here on the Favorites screen. Just hit Edit and remove them.\n\nA: I agree with Morpheus. I actually spent a lot of time on the phone with Apple support today with the same issue. Three different support specialists (one senior), and none of them had a solution. \nMy solution was to go into the news app and shut off all the alerts I really didn't care about. It's a work around for now until the next update fixes it. \n\nA: I have been having the same issue. It must be a bug.

I currently use a 2014 MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 2 ports, and I want to futureproof my purchase by acquiring a cheaper USB-C dock now.\nThe cheapest Thunderbolt 2 dock costs around $200 while USB-C docks cost around $30. Being able to use a USB-C dock with older Thunderbolt 2 Macbook Pros would not only be cheaper but also allows me to use the same USB-C dock if I decided to upgrade to a future Macbook.\nFor that to work I need a Thunderbolt 2 (male) to USB-C female adaptor, after some searching it doesn't seem to exist. Is there a reason why something like this hasn't been made? Or is the USB-C specification designed such that it is impossible? (hence businesses can still continue to sell expensive Thunderbolt 2 docks...)\nI will accept an answer that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*If there is such an adapter please give a link and some form of evidence that these would have 100% compatibility with USB-C docks.\n\n*If there is no such adapter please explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it impossible to produce?\n\n*If not, why hasn't a vendor created one yet? I've explained that its a better financial investment than buying a TB2 dock... surely there's a market for those still using TB2 MBPs wanting to upgrade in the next couple of years. Not only docks but it would open a gateway to cheaper alternatives to those hideously expensive TB2 peripherals.\n\n\n\nA: No.\nThere is no Apple product to do this - unless you allow Thunderbolt 3 which uses the same USB-C connector but a different hardware entirely. \nIn that case (you don’t need USB - but only thunderbolt over USB-C type connection), here's Apple's Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) adapter. Using it with this Thunderbolt 2 cable should allow you to connect your non-2016 MBP to a USB-C Thunderbolt 3 dock of your choice, because, as Apple says in the adapter's description:\n\nAs a bidirectional adapter, it can also connect new Thunderbolt 3 devices to a Mac with a Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt 2 port and macOS Sierra.\n\nNote: The dock can't be any USB-C dock, it must be a Thunderbolt 3 one (thanks jksoegaard).\n\n\nA: (Assuming you mean to say that you have a MacBook Pro and not a MacBook because there is no MacBook that was made in 2014.)\nYou aren't going to find a Thunderbolt 2 to USB-C adapter as it makes no sense for vendors to create one. \nFirst off, let's address the core (technical) premise of the question:\n\n...I need a Thunderbolt 2 (male) to USB-C female adaptor,\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between thunderbolt 3 using the USB-C connector style as opposed to the underlying data and voltages being compatible for USB to Thunderbolt.  To use a car analogy, this is like asking for a gasoline that specifically works in convertibles.  USB-C is just how the port is physically laid out.  Thunderbolt is neither \"compatible\" nor \"incompatible\" with nor does it convert to  USB-C.  Thunderbolt 3 uses a USB-C connector; it \"embeds\" USB 3.1, PCIe, DisplayPort (DP) and power on the same set of cables.  It's like having 4 different adapters and plugs in one.\nTo continue the vehicle analogy - imagine having one pump that could safely detect if diesel (and which blend) or gasoline (leaded or unleaded) or ethanol (of many different blends) is needed from the same one hose that is inserted in to the side of the vehicle. Many fuel types can flow through one connector as opposed to designing a different connector for each fuel type.\n\nBeing able to use a USB-C dock with older Thunderbolt 2 Macbook Pros\n  would not only be cheaper but also allows me to use the same USB-C\n  dock if I decided to upgrade to a future Macbook.\n\nYes it would be cheaper, but unfortunately, that's not how it works.  There are a couple of mix-ups between what a TB dock is and what a USB dock is:\n\n\n*\n\n*The type of dock (TB or USB) is how the connection originates.  You plug a TB dock into a TB port.  You plug a USB dock into a USB port.  A TB dock uses the TB protocol, while the USB dock uses the USB protocol.\n\n*USB-C is just the plug type.  It's a USB 3.1 port.  So, to use a USB dock with a USB-C adapter it must go into a USB 3.1 port with a USB-C connector.\nAs such, there is no such thing as a \"USB-C dock.\"  This is like asking for a \"convertible gas station.\"  What exists is a USB dock.\nA Thunderbolt 3 port with a USB-C connector supports USB 3.1.  However, a USB 3.1 port with a USB-C connector DOESN'T support Thunderbolt. \nSo, unlike TB3, TB2 does not have USB signaling embedded (and this is where it gets confusing). It's PCIe, DP, and power only.  So, to get USB, you need an adapter.  \nTo better understand what PCIe is, the best way is to have a look at it in it's most common format.  Below is photo of a PC motherboard but not any technically different than an Apple logic board (they are essentially the same thing). \n\nTo add USB ports, you need an interface into this \"bus\" like the adapter below:\n\nThunderbolt is basically the PCIe port in the first picture in a nice, clean cable and your TB adapters (USB, Ethernet, storage, etc) are dongle version of the second picture.\nYou can't really \"future proof\" anything in Tech.  Ask anyone who purchased an Xerve G5.  What you can do is architect the solution that maxes out your investment.\nSo, what you need is a path to go from Thunderbolt 2 to USB 3.  Once you have USB 3, you can get whatever adapter it starts from (USB-A) and convert it to what you need (USB-C).  What is important to understand here is that while you can connect USB device with USB-C connectors, you will be limited to Gen 1 speeds - 5Gbs as opposed to 10Gbs.\nThe device that gets you closest to this is the Elgato Thunderbolt 2 Laptop Dock with Thunderbolt Cable.  \n\nTo get your USB-C connected devices, you will just need the right USB 3.1 A to C cable\n\nAs to your questions as to why this adapter doesn't exist:\n\nIf there is no such adapter please explain: \n  Is it impossible to produce? \n\nNot at all.  As explained above this is basically a USB to PCIe adapter and may adapters like Ethernet already exist.\n\nIf not, why hasn't a vendor created one yet? I've explained that its a better financial investment than buying a TB2 dock...surely there's a market for those still using TB2 MBPs wanting to upgrade in the next couple of years. Not only docks but it would open a gateway to cheaper alternatives to those hideously expensive TB2 peripherals.\n\nIs a better financial investment for YOU or for the manufacturer(s)?  Without getting into a lengthy history of TB1, TB2, TB3 and its market share, it's quite safe to say that the time between the release of TB1 and TB3 is quite short.  In fact, the time between TB2 and TB3 is about a year and the only major vendor to include TB2 ports was Apple.  TB2 never had a chance to even gain interest, let alone acceptance and adoption before TB3 and USB 3.1 was released.  As it stands, we are talking about a technology (TB2) that is already obsolete for a product (MBP 2014) that now 3 years old. \nKeep in mind that Apple's Mac shipments for 2014 was around 7% of market share on about 20 million units.  While that sounds massive to you and me, keep in mind, it would be best case scenario that 10% of the market, or about 2 million potential units.  Again, huge for you and me, but tiny for the manufacturer(s) who, by the way, would have to split that small market between the other vendors.\nManufacturers are going to create products for markets that have growth potential, not for ones that will only continue to get smaller with the passage of time.\n\nDo you know the surest way to go broke?  Keep getting an increasing\n  share of a shrinking market.\n  ----Lawrence Garfield (Danny DeVito, Other People's Money)  \n\n\nA: The USB-C connector serves Thunderbolt 3 on the new MacBook Pros. This includes support for both the Thunderbolt protocol and the USB-C protocol. This is why you can connect both Thunderbolt devices and USB devices to the connector with simple adapters.\nThe Thunderbolt 2 connector on older MacBooks do not support USB in any version. They support the Thunderbolt protocol only. That's why you cannot buy a simple, passive adapter that allows you to connect a USB-C dock or any other USB devices to the Thunderbolt port.\nWhat you can do is to connect an active device to the Thunderbolt 2 port that contains a USB controller, etc. and thus expands your computer with extra USB ports. It could be for example the Kanex \"Thunderbolt to eSATA + USB 3.0 adapter\" which is priced at approx. 80 EUR.\nYou could then use a USB-A to USB-C adapter cable to connect your docking station, assuming that it works over USB 3.0 and doesn't require USB 3.1, power distribution over USB-C or the alternate mode signal from the TB3 port (DisplayPort).\n\nA: https://www.caldigit.com/usb-c-pro-dock/ could be an option. But bear in mind that you will be running the monitor signal over USB 3.0 (as an \"older MacBook (Pro)\" may not have USB 3.1/3.2 yet.

It had absolutely terrible key feel. My typo rate soared.\nCan anyone with the new Magic Keyboard, MLA22LL/A, who has used the older wired keyboard comment on the keys feel in comparison? I am specifically asking about the \"throw\" of the key travel of the two, and the force. The throw on the wireless was fine compared to my wired, but the force was much greater than the wired.\nNote: I am asking for quantitative comparisons, not opinions.\n\nA: The current 2016 Bluetooth magic keyboard has larger keys so your press feels lighter even though I believe the stiffness is either the same absolutely or perhaps a bit stiffer if you were to calculate or measure the force.\nStructurally, the scissors are more even and the keys don't wobble as much.

They have the same OS X (El Capitan). Can I create a recovery partition with Recovery Partition Creator from the working Mac and use it to restore the OS in my other Mac? Is it possible? If not are there other methods?\n\nA: Yes it is possible. As long as you have a Mac that does work and a USB media drive, that not currently of high importance, that contains 8 GB or more of free storage. \nFirst you'll need to download a copy of the OS (El Capitan), you'll do this be going into the Mac App Store and finding it in the purchased tab.

You can do this either using DiskMaker X 5 or Terminal. For when using Terminal you could watch this video the video shows you how to use the createinstallmedia tool for macOS Sierra, however Mac OS X El Capitan has the exact same Install tool, so the process of creating the terminal command would be exactly the same as long as the createinstallmedia tool is the same, which it is.\nOnce you have eventually created your Mac OS X recovery USB, you can then boot to it by holding shift ‘option’ turning the machine on to reach the boot menu, where you can select the Mac OS X recovery USB you have created once it is inserted into the device. \nAlso, before you do anything, or at least whilst you're waiting for OS to download, I recommend you go through the following guides (you need to do a web search for them since I can't reputation to just link them here):\nMashable - How to do a clean install of OS X El Capitan\nLifewire - Perform a Clean Install of OS X El Capitan on Your Mac\n95to5Mac  - How-To: Create a macOS Sierra USB Install Disk (same video I linked to earlier)\n", "Q: How do you change the number registered for iMessage?

On Android phones, there are apps (not native functionality) to make the phone silent for the next N minutes starting right now. This is different than setting specific times of day like Do Not Disturb does.\nThe functionality I'm used to takes one of two forms:\n\n\n*\n\n*An icon you click that then asks \"how long should the silence last\"\n\n*Or, automatically detect that I turned off the sound to zero (via volume rockers or otherwise); and asks the same thing.\n\n*However, I'm not dogmatic, if iPhone has some other approach to solve this problem I'm open to exploring it.\n\n\nIs something like this available on iPhone? (6, OS version 10 if it matters).\nI prefer native functionality if it exists. Otherwise, an App store app is OK as long as it's free (as in gratis) doesn't require jailbreaking and works on iPhone 6.\nExtra plus if it supports both modes described above (trigger with the icon or with setting volume to zero); as well as supposed 100% silence or vibrate-only mode.\n\nA: While time-limited muting does exist on Android, it does not on iOS. You can set your phone to silent (by using the mute switch on the side of the phone), but you can't set it to silent for N hours. This feature could come in a future software update (try suggesting it to Apple) but can't come from an app, as iOS apps are forbidden from controlling ringer volume or Do Not Disturb setting. \nYou can, however, set DND to come on for a specific time period every night, having it automatically turn on at 10pm and turn off at 7am, say (times are customizable). That's in Settings->Do Not Disturb->Scheduled.\n\n\nSource of information about apps not being able to control ringer volume: my personal knowledge as a published iOS developer and this answer.\n\nA: In the “correct” and most voted answer comment, you’ve suggested that an on the spot DnD timing would be preferable over the scheduled one. The screenshot I have added is from shortcuts app and does exactly that. Also if you you follow the other shortcut you can enter the time in text format till which you want dnd to be turned on. Furthermore, with some better skills, I hope one can use the time provided in the siri command just like in the other answer and its comments, it is 3 hours. \n\n\nA: As of iOS 12, there are now built-in options for Do Not Disturb that you let you set it in a more granular or \"smarter\" way.

You can also turn this on and off manually from Control Center\n\n*Do Not Disturb During Bedtime: this is an additional option to scheduled Do Not Disturb that will also dim the lock screen and send all incoming notifications to your history (so you can review them after DND ends)\n\n\nShort of using a Siri shortcut, I don't think there's any way to set Do Not Disturb for an exact number of minutes, but the above options will probably cover most situations in which you'd want to do that.\n\nA: \"siri, please mute phone calls for the next 3 hours!\"\n", "Q: Use of regular expressions in macOS search fields Does anyone know where I can find the docs describing Regex parsing capabilities of macOS search fields?\nWhat I mean, I'd like to read about the regex syntax rules that are allowed and parsed by the search field.

Also does this format of input apply to systemwide search fields of any application? \nI can't find any docs describing these features and was found only this on developer.apple.com library instead.\nBelow you can see an example of default search behaviour for a \"an\" word within a PDF document, it shows all \"an\" occurences in the results, regardless if you put a space before the \"an\" word, so your input is \" an \" \n\nWhen we put \"\\s\" AND \"an\" AND \"\\s\" into the search field we get the more desired search result\n\nThis makes a huge difference for searches containing common words!\nIn short: I'd like to know more about the functionality you see above. Where can I find any (official) documentation about it?\nThe answers provided (so far) are not answering my question, thank you for them though - aggregating more related information is good.\n\nA: I don't know if you discovered this already but you just need to click on the magnifying glass in the search field, it has a little down-pointing caret which is the clue, see this screenshot:\n\nAfter clicking choose Insert Pattern and you get a range of options:\nThis is basically user-friendly regex, i.e. you get tokens you can easily arrange into quite powerful search patterns.\n\nThe example in the screenshot is TextEdit however this option doesn't appear to be available in Preview.\n\nA: This Apple Support article on how to Narrow your search results on Mac is the most detailed documentation I have been able to find on Finder searches. While the OP is mainly asking about regular expression searches in Preview, the question title brought me here looking for the same information for Finder searches.\nThe last section on boolean operators (Search using AND, OR, and NOT) is relevant also for Preview, although their utility for text search is rather questionable. Regular expressions are not mentioned, so I suppose these are not supported in the macOS search fields.\n\nA: This isn't regular expressions; I'm afraid you've faked yourself out. in most of Apple's document apps, there's a distinction between search for \"...\" (placed within quotes) ... (entered without quotes). The first will search for the enclosed text as a word; the second searches for the text without regarding word boundaries.\nSo, when we enter the following:\n\n\"\\s\" AND \"an\" AND \"\\s\"\n\nthe parser searches for a literal word s (ignoring the backslash), then the word an then another literal word s. Since it's extremely unlikely to find 's' as an independent word, the result is exactly the same as if we had merely entered:\n\n\"an\"\n\nbut different from what happens if we enter:\n\nan\n\nConfusing, I know...\n", "Q: Undo an autocorrected word on the iPhone keyboard The iPhone's keyboard seems extremely diligent with its autocorrection.\nProblem is, I very frequently type words that aren't in the dictionary (proper names, foreign words, etc...). \nIn some Android keyboards, there is a function to undo a word that was autocorrected to the original spelling—is such a functionality available in iPhone's default keyboard?\n\nA: There's a pretty simple way to undo any auto-correct on the iPhone's keyboard: if you type a word that autocorrects, just hit the delete key, and a popup of suggestions for that word will pop up. The first suggestion is the word you had before it was autocorrected. \nSo say you type thid, which autocorrects to this, but you really meant to type thid. \nJust type thid, then hit space, then backspace, then a popup with the word thid will appear. Tap it to undo the autocorrection.\nHere's a video.\n\n", "Q: Messed up my /private folder! I had a folder named private in one of my projects and had to change the permissions of it via chmod, however, instead of \"private\" I did \"/private\"!\nI am an idiot and can't figure out how to get it back. My shell is all messed up now and I am trying to restore the /private folder via time machine and no luck! It starts but then says \"Security agent may only be invoked by apple software\"\nI know this a HUGE mistake and any help would be appreciated.

This is the keyboard app made by Google for iOS devices.\nIt seems like it learns custom words after I manually type them out a few times, but how many times must they be typed out? And is pressing a space after the word necessary to register it as a word? Since I'll often go to Safari and type a custom word and hit Enter.\nAnd removing custom words, the only way to do this seems to be to wait until Gboard auto-corrects a word I type to a custom word that I want to delete, then if I backspace and re-write the word, then after a few times of this, it will learn to remove that word. But otherwise, there doesn't seem to be any way to manually remove a custom word. Please let me know if I'm wrong.\nEdit: One thing I realized is that custom words will not be added to Gboard's dictionary if they are typed into fields with autocorrect disabled, such as Safari's address bar, which is where I type most of my custom words.\n\nA: Adding custom words is done by typing them once. Once typed once, the word will be available using Glide Typing. It may not have a high priority, but gliding accurately enough will choose it, and the more it is used the higher priority it becomes just like any other word.\nRemoving an individual custom word is not possible currently. You can clear the entire custom dictionary in Gboard → Keyboard Settings → Clear my dictionary.\n\nA: I am also intrigued about how to edit the vocabulary.  Some misspellings have found their way in, but I was very pleased to discover that Gboard had learned my email address. However it recently seems to have unlearned it. No idea how or why. \n", "Q: OSX Boot drive selection screen is slow, un-responsive and takes forever to load in Macbook Pro (early 2015) I have a Macbook Pro Retina 13\" (Early 2015) and I have a bootcamp partition with Windows 10 installed in it. Also, there is an Ubuntu Linux on another partition, so it’s a triple boot computer. I’m not using rEFInd, but the stock startup manager instead. I am switching operating systems using the option key at boot and it was all working fine until recently.\nThe problem I am facing right now is that every time I turn my laptop on or try to switch operating systems using the option key the drive selection screen takes a long time to appear, like literally 20 to 30 seconds. This is not really normal because it used to be 2-3 seconds. Also, once the drive selection screen appears the mouse pointer just doesn't work or sometimes work un-reliably or extremely slowly. I can use the arrow keys in the keyboard to select the drives but the response is just too slow. Once i hit an arrow key it takes 15 to 20 seconds to register and move the selection, sometimes it doesn't respond at all. And then finally when I hit return it takes another half a minute or so to load up the boot sequence. After that the operating system works just fine. I also have GRUB on one of the partitions for loading Linux. When I select Linux in the Startup Manager drive selection screen the GRUB console starts and it works very slow as well: I have to type commands and wait 10 seconds for the letters to appear on the screen. Ubuntu itself works just fine.\nCould anyone please point me out on any possible causes of the problem? I will provide any additional info if you request.\nThere is a very similar question, but it was solved by completely reinstalling everything. However I would like to find the real cause of the problem to be able to prevent it in future (my setup is kinda complex, and I don’t want to reinstall everything just to face this problem again in a month or two).\nUpdate 1:\nI have tried to reset NVRAM and SMC with no result.\nUpdate 2:\nI don't remember what exactly preceded the happening of this issue, but here are my thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Perhaps this happened after I installed \"Paragon NTFS for Mac OS X\" or \"FUSE for OS X\". I have both installed now and I use them to access Windows and Linux partitions\n\n*Maybe this happened after the hibernation of the Windows partition\n\n*It's possible that the issue happened after the system update, but it definitely happened long before the major update from El Capitan to Sierra.\n\n*The issue takes place not only in Startup Manager, but in any software that is running before the OS starts booting. Recovery, Hardware Diagnostics, Startup Manager, and even GRUB (which is on it's own partition) all work extremely laggy. If I don't hold any keys and let the macOS boot normally, then everything that occurs before the apple logo is taking much more time than it should. As soon the logo and progress bar appear - the lags are gone. Same with other OSes.\n\n\nThe operating system is macOS Sierra 10.12.1 along with Windows 10 and Ubuntu. I have tried to run Apple hardware diagnostics (by holding down the D key at startup) and got this message:\n\nThere may be an issue with the SD card reader. Reference code VDC001\n\nI've noticed that when I bought the laptop this test passed without any issues.\nI also tried to boot in Safe Mode, but nothing happened, except that the macOS GUI was glitchy and choppy while in safe mode.\nUpdate 3:\nI have found an interesting behaviour. The issue is gone just for one boot whenever I do these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu Live USB stick\n\n*Choose \"Shut down\" -> \"Restart\" from Ubuntu system menu\n\n*The subsequent boot goes without slugging, seems like the issue is gone, no matter which OS I choose this time.\n\n\nBut the issue is back at the next boot. Also, if I choose to \"Shut down\" at the step 2, the subsequent boot is slugging like every other.\nWhat could be so special in Ubuntu live stick, that it cures the issue for one time?\n\nA: Troubleshooting is often a process of elimination, so it can take time and patience. We'll have to work through these steps one at a time until we can identify the cause and resolve it.\n1. Software\nAs a starting point, I would update macOS Sierra to 10.12.2 (it's been out for about two weeks now).\nI'd also ensure you have the latest version of Paragon NTFS for Mac OS X and FUSE for macOS installed.\nOnce you've ensured you have the latest versions installed, let us know how you go.\n\nA: Important: Do not use paragon crappy hfs+ implementation, since windows will at some point cripple your system partition! If you need HFS+ access on Windows use macdrive\nFirst boot into single user mode (hold the S key during boot)\nand after some dmesg messages you should see a command prompt, do: \nfsck -fy / and see if there are any errors. After the run type reboot if there were any changes or exit if nothing needed repairs.\nIf you have anything on your USB ports when booting, take it out - entry scan take long, especially if its some legacy USB devices. Your problem seems to be in entry scan part of booting (searching for bootable partitions of type EFI with bootflag) and/or with a device that is causing read errors. To get to the bottom of it:\nTry the following first - assuming that disk0s1 is your ESP aka EFI partition, open up terminal and:\nLet's check the bless output: \nstep 1 sudo bless --device /dev/disk0s1 --setBoot --nextonly --verbose\npaste the output somewhere please so I can take a look on it. Reboot after that and see if the behaviour changes- might also help. \nstep 2 Let's get rid of any NVARS with boot entries and make sure they are cleared:\nLaunch any kind of linux from EFI (meaning booting not through MBR) - you can take Ubuntu live CD for that, after booting it, launch the terminal and do: sudo efibootmgr -v - if you get an error of not having efibootmgr command do sudo apt-get install efibootmgr (should install this package)\nOnce you got the efibootmgr -v (keep the output somewhere for later review) \nyou should see something like this:\n[root@localhost ~]# efibootmgr\n  BootCurrent: 0004\n  BootNext: 0003\n  BootOrder: 0004,0000,0001,0002,0003\n  Timeout: 30 seconds\n  Boot0000* Diskette Drive(device:0)\n  Boot0001* CD-ROM Drive(device:FF) \n  Boot0002* Hard Drive(Device:80)/HD(Part1,Sig00112233)\n  ...\n\nUse the hex value to delete each entry with -B -b flag:\nefibootmgr -B -b 0001\nefibootmgr -B -b 0000 \nuntil it cries that there are no entries anymore. Don't worry about it,\nthose variables are set to default each time if they are not set by your macbooks firmware - and that's what we want, we can see if the default boot device is having scanning issues or scanning issues are created by obsolete entries. \nLet me know when you do this - in most cases you will be done at this point, if you won't - let me know here and we can look into it further. \nI strongly recommend to use refind as bootmgr, its not native, but it does not look for Timemachine and does not calls home through wifi ;) also it gives you better options in case of troubles and you can still can use the native apple's EFI boot, refind does not care about it - its just a change in your boot order list so refind is on it. It also loads some .efi drivers for extra access and functionality at boot time, so far I know they  don't collide with apple firmware.\nshort update: You can use nvram -p and nvram -c to clear nvram directly in macOS from terminal\n\nA: This problem depends on a firmware issue that prevents the I/O board from working properly.\nI suggest to upgrade to MacOS Sierra 10.12.4, which contains a firmware update that address this issue.\n\nA: Based on the information provided in the updates and the comments, there appears to be a problem with the SSD; either a physical problem or a problem with the partition table.  Especially since the \"problem went away\" when you booted Linux.\nWhen you turn on your Mac, it loads the EFI from ROM.  Basically, long before any software or addins like FUSE or MacDrive or Paragon can be loaded, it's loading up drivers to read the hard drive.  Note:  It only knows how to read HFS+ and MBR; it has no clue how to read NTFS.\n\nIf/when you press Option during boot, it brings up a GUI boot manager.  It will scan the available volumes for a header that tells it what type of boot partition is available.  This is the list you get to choose from.\nIf you notice, before it boots the volume, it writes the boot volume info to NVRAM.  This is why it worked after your Linux boot; it had clean volume info.\nAlso if you are running Boot Camp, you aren't booting  directly to to the NTFS partition directly, you are using a boot loader (Boot Camp) to boot Windows.  If you have multiple OSes like macOS, Linux, and Windows, you are probably using a different boot loader like GRUB.\n\nNow, if you were to issue the command diskutil list you would see that it only displays a GPT header for Boot Camp, not the actual NTFS Boot Camp partition itself. EFI can't boot NTFS; only HFS and MBR - this is why we need the boot loader.\n\nDiagnose the issue\nFor this procedure, you are going to need another bootable medium like an external USB drive or a USB flash (like your Linux USB, but macOS).\nThe way you diagnose if your SSD is the problem is to remove the SSD.  It's a fairly simple process of removing the back cover and removing the module.  iFixit.com has an excellent guide on how to do this.\nYou won't need to put the back cover back just yet; just make sure you work on a clean, flat, non-conductive surface. (In other words, don't work on a dirty, metal table or on a bed or pillow)\n\nOnce removed, insert your USB drive/flash and procede to boot.  If the problem goes away, the issue is with your SSD.  If it remains there is an issue with your controller/logic board.  It's time to get it looked at\nTo diagnose the SSD.\nFor this procedure, you are going to want to make sure you have a full backup of your drive.\nOnce you are sure your SSD is backed up, wipe your SSD and do a clean installation of macOS.  The the problem persists, your SSD is most likely faulty.  If not, then it's most likely there was a corrupt GPT table.  Do a full, clean install of both macOS and Boot Camp.  Then do a restore your data from Time Machine (backup).\nOnce you have determined whether it's your drive's partition table or a physical problem, you can proceed from there.\n\nA: Same issue here, noticed it in FileVault, but then realized it is there even on Boot selection section or even Diagnosis section. Disabling FileVault won't solve the issue, it will just cover it up.\nI wasted a lot of time with software sides of things, reinstalling OS and all. they all didn't help. It is a Hardware issue.\nI realized I have this issue once I started using SD Card reader for storing my files and extending my 128gb MBP. If SD Cards goes in, even for 1 second, and then take it out, boot is going to be slow until I do a NVRAM reset. Apple care didn't find any issue first time but second time they admit there is a hardware issue in my Macbook and they replaced it. I will report back issue returned.\nYou need to bring it to Apple care, and describe the issue in detail. I had to print a A4 paper with a detailed description (told them issue happen when put in a sd card and then take it out) and screenshot of diagnosis page showing SD Card error in diagnosis boot page (because for some reasons, it was randomly showing that error and apparently when I give my Macbook for first repair, it passed test 100% successfully) Reception who receive my Macbook, she didn't really reflect things I told to her to technician. She even typed issue of my macbook as \"Booth up slow\", you get the idea.\nYeah, you need to bring it to apple care for hardware fix and bring enough documents to prove them it is hardware issue.\n\nA: I understand that the issue could hapeen with update process, Paragon NTFS or some boot error, but I had similar experience on early 2015 MacBook Pro fixed up by disabling full disk encryption in recovery. After re-enabling it everything worked well. I recommend fixing disk permissions in recovery, too.\n\nA: A simple test - can you boot from SD Card? Just install a small OS on it, and, after pressing option, select the SD Card. If your Macbook has an IR receiver, make sure to cover it with some black tape, sometimes these things break and give constant signals which result in the behaviour you describe.\n\nA: I have the same issue. Refit takes forever to load. I have also tried the regular reset SMC, PRAM, etc. I am triple booting my system with archlinux and windows 10. A few other people have this problem with the early 2015 macbook pro as well. Which SSD do you have? I have the 512 Gb version. I really dont want to start over again and reinstall everything.\nHere's a similar link: OSX Startup Manager (Boot drive selection screen) slow/un-responsive in Macbook Pro (early 2015)\n\nA: There is simple way to verify if you have the Bad SD-I/O Card problem.\nJust hold down the D Key on power up and it will run diagnostics.\nI brought mine to the Apple Store and that is the first thing they did and the SD Card popped up with an error. Even though my SD Card worked fine.\nThe Part cost about $42.00 New\nThey installed it the same day (after waiting 1 day for the part to arrive).\nTotal cost was $124.00 Part + Labour + Tax\nThere are places on the net you can buy the part new or used and replace yourself. I'm fairly technical and done repairs like this but I decided to pass on this one. Involves removing CPU Heatsink and fan and quite a few small connectors.\nYou can see Videos on Youtube for similar repair on MacBook Air.\niFixit has detailed description on repair for this exact laptop.\n\nA: some 2015 macbook pro owner reporting the slow/unresponding issue has gone after update to the newest macos 10.12.4beta8. It is clearly a driver issue and apple has finally addressing that on their latest update.\n\nA: I had the same issue and it's finally gone after the update to 10.12.4.\n", "Q: Mac Pro processor upgrade, won't boot I just upgraded my Mac Pro 4,1 (5,1 firmware) to dual X5690s. I was very careful and followed directions throughout the whole process.\nWhen I put the CPU tray back in, the computer wouldn't post. There are no hardware errors, but it won't boot. I have tried an SMC and NVRAM reset to no avail. Upon pressing the power button, the power light turns on and remains lit. No red LED problem lights appear in the computer. The GPU fan speeds up to full, like it always does on a boot, but then instead of slowing down, it remains at full. All other fans are at normal speeds. My boot drive is an SSD on a PCIe SATA adapter. \nEverything was working normally this morning before my project. Any troubleshooting suggestions? \n(I've heard maybe tightening the heat sinks down more, but I don't want to over tighten them.) Also, the first time I tested the upgraded tray, the power button was flashing, so I tightened the heatsinks a bit more. \nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Processors either work or they don't. As long as they are siting in their sockets correctly. Tightening the heatsinks is unlikely to do anything, but be careful not to over tighten as you could damage something if you do.\nYou could take them out and verify the sockets are clean and free of obstructions and that there are no bent pins. You could also swap which socket which proc is in. I know that doesn't make sense but sometimes it just works that way.\nTry with the old Procs in place if that is possible. If they work then you may have the wrong upgrade processor(s) or a defective one or two.\n", "Q: Are these Canon websites safe to download printer software? I'd like some drivers for printer.

An iPhone 5.  It came with iOS 10.1.1 installed and I was wondering if there is a jailbreak for this?\nI've been looking on Google and have tried a few different methods but they all seem to be fake and only install a \"Cydia demo\".  \nCan anyone point me towards finding a legitimate jailbreak or is non available?\n\nA: Edit: You can now use h3lix by tihmstar to jailbreak 10.x on all 32 bit devices(computer required).\n\n\nAt this time you cannot jailbreak the iPhone 5 on iOS 10.1.1.\nIf you watched the video by EverythingApplePro, he said that the jailbreak currently doesn't work on iPhone 5(because it is a 32-bit only jailbreak). Right now, even if the jailbreak did work on iPhone 5, you won't be able to install anything YET.\nBe on the watchout for a jailbreak for iPhone 5, but there are low chances of the iPhone 5 getting a jailbreak(on 10.1.1). I recommend the Youtube channels iCrackUriDevice and EverythingApplePro. It is recommended you stay on 10.1.1, because that has the most possibilities for a jailbreak.\n\n\nA: This is no \"official\" jailbreak on 10.1.1 yet.

So, I have a pretty grave problem that I really need help with.  Earlier today, I decided to remove my old and buggy bootcamp partition and reinstall windows.  Problem was, bootcamp assistant didn't allow me to pick the same size as I previously had, so I decided to try to forcibly resize the Mac partition using diskutil resizevolume and then format the unallocated space into FAT32.  \nThat's when my real problem started.  I was unable to use disk utility to convert that unallocated space afterwards, and a few boots later, I even think that the recovery partition seems to have taken the unallocated space for itself.\nThis is my main partition, for reference:\n\nAnd this is what diskutil list shows:\n \nSo my question now is this: how do I return things to normal on my hd and reclaim all the space for the main partition?  Do I have to delete the Recovery HD partition and reinstall it afterwards?  Or am I making a mistake and the space is still somehow unallocated?    \n\nA: You somehow merged disk0s3 and disk0s4 (the Windows partition) to one big recovery partition - consequently there is no unallocated disk space. With your published commands this shouldn't have happened though.\nThe fastest way to get a default partition scheme is to merge disk0s2 with disk0s3 and later recreate Recovery HD with a tool like Recovery Partition Creator.\nThe merge command is:\ndiskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ \"Macintosh HD\" disk0s2 disk0s3\n\nThe command will merge Macintosh HD and Recovery HD to one big Macintosh HD while retaining the content of your main system volume.\n", "Q: Would signing out of iCloud delete my locally stored photos? I am trying to sign into my iCloud on my iPhone 6 and even with the correct password it is not letting me through but keeps asking with a prompt. I have local photos that I do not want deleted and need to pull off the device. If I were to sign out of my iCloud account will it delete the photos that are stored locally? \n\nA: iCloud always asks you if it deletes local copies and it only deletes copies it knows are stored online, so you should be safe to remove an account.\nIf you're worried, make an iCloud and iTunes back up just in case, but signing out only is intended to clear things that came down from the cloud and even then it offers you the option of keeping local copies of data in many classes of data (contacts is the one I see often).\n\nA: This pictures would be deleted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shared albums that you are invited to –but do not own\n\n*Local low resolution pictures that have a full resolution copy on iCloud –when iCloud Photo Library is on, and Optimize [device] storage is on\n\n*My Photo Stream Pictures that were not taken by the device, even if copied to the All Photos album\nOther than this, your local pictures shouldn't be affected.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my iPhone 6s plus charge while it is on the cable? I plug my iPhone 6s plus into the lightning cable and it will make the \"chime\" sound to let you know it is charging, but if I move it even so slightly on the table where it charges or pick it up to text, it will stop charging. \nI checked to see if my cable was the problem, but it charges my iPad. It must be my iPhone lightning port then? \nSometimes even when I do not touch my iPhone and it is charging, it will keep making the charging sound and light up (as if it was unplugged and the re connected). \n\nA: I've had the same problem. Sometimes shooting a little compressed air in the port or taking a swipe in there with a clean cloth (not a q-tip or kleenex) can get rid of gunk that might build up from normal use (like the phone being in a bag or pocket that has dust, dirt, lint and such.) My old 3G (with the wide charger) was doing the exact same thing until I cleaned it out - had a TON of dog hair, lint, grime, tobacco and such from like four years of riding in my pocket. Pushing in the charger just pushes down and compacts whatever is in there.\nSome people suggest a toothpick or using a little rubbing alcohol (like 90% so minimal watercontent) but whatever you use I'd recommend being gentle. Here's a video where they gently use a pin. Whatever you choose to try, I'd first shine a bright light in there and take a good look (even better if you have a magnifying glass). Here are some more suggestions if mine don't help.\nMy folks have big cover cases for their mobiles which have flaps that close over the charging port, I just looked in their charging ports and there didn't look to be any gunk, so maybe a good idea for moving forward with a lint free mobile lifestyle?\n\nA: One thing I did recently on a few cables that were acting up was to gently scrub the “Lightning” cable end that goes into the phone with a brass brush.  I think they were gunked up/had some corrosion so the contact wasn’t good.  They were both fine after that.\nThe answer about cleaning the port is more likely right in your case. However, there’s little downside to cleaning a $15 cable first.\n\nA: I think possibly it's your phone battery is leaking or phone port is broken.\n", "Q: Automator Print Plugin: Append Output to Existing PDF File I would like to create a Print Plugin to append the output to an existing PDF File.\nHere are my steps so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask for Finder Items\n\n*Combine PDF Pages (append)\n\n*Open Finder Items\n\n\nIt sort of does the job, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*It prepends the output: the new output is inserted at the beginning rather than the end.\n\n*I creates a new file.\n\n\nI can handle the new file situation, I suppose, by doing a Save As…, but I don’t want the new output to be placed at the beginning.\nHow can I append the output at the end of an existing PDF file?\n\nA: A very old discussion on https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2240963 had the solution.\nHere is a working version of the plugin:\n1   Ask for Finder Items\n        Type: Files\n2   Set Value of Variable\n        Variable: original\n3   Run Shell Script\n        Pass input: as arguments\n        Script: echo $2\n                echo $1\n4   Combine PDF Pages\n        Combine documents by: Appending pages\n5   Get Value of Variable\n        Variable: original\n6   Run Shell Script\n        Pass input: as arguments\n        Script: mv $1 $3\n7   Open Finder Items\n        Open with: Default Application\n\nStep 3 solves the problem of appending rather than prepending the file by echoing the items in the reverse order.

Fortunately, I restored old iTerm2 in the trash can, and made a comparison. \nIn each of the four pictures, the left penal is a tex file, the right a cpp file, and the terminal's theme is always Tango dark, with no additional alteration. \nIn such order, they are: October iTerm2 with \"default\" color of vim's; October iTerm2 with \"koehler\" color of vim's; November iTerm2 with \"default\" color of vim's; November iTerm2 with \"koehler\" color of vim's. \nCompared with the 1st picture, I am sure the 3rd picture has something wrong, but the 2nd and 4th are similar. \nSo it seems the \"default\" scheme of vim is rendered incorrectly, and I found that it is not the only color scheme affected, like \"desert\" is also different, but I am not going to post so many pictures here for sake of space. \nSo, is it true that iTerm2 makes some mistake in interpreting vim's color settings? If it doesn't, why is 1st and 3rd pictures so different, and what's wrong? \nIf it does, is there some way to make iTerm2 apply correct color for \"default\" in the old manner, since I like it (1st picture, right panel). \nYou might think me fussy, but I use vim in iTerm2 every day. \nOr the best advice for me is that I never shall update and stick to old iTerm2 from now on?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Because set termguicolors in .vimrc is not set. \nThis is how I understand it; correct if I am wrong. \nA terminal emulator may either use ANSI colors or the terminal's own color palette. \nMac's native Terminal can only achieve the former; iTerm2 can do both. \nWith termguicolors off, iTerm2 uses ANSI colors. \nAfter termguicolors is set on, it uses its own GUI colors. \nColors becomes more vivid, as is in the screenshot. \nOnly when I converted to \"solarized\" color scheme did this suddenly occur to me. \nStill, you can see in the picture, it seems that newer version of iTerm2 has lighter color. \nNever mind.

A while ago something happened to the file system on this disk but Disk Utility managed to rescue everything. However, one problem - all inode numbers were messed up and iTunes seems to prioritize inode number to the soft path to files. Now I have a couple of hundred files in my music library that points towards directories rather than files. I have to, in iTunes, manually change these pointers. This is the steps I have to take to achieve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Duplicate the directory.\n\n*Delete (rm -rf, putting them in the Trash is not enough) the original directory.\n\n*Cmd-I on the file in iTunes, who then complains that the file can't be found.\n\n*Locate the correct file in iTunes fila dialog\n\n*Rename the duplicated directory to the original name (iTunes falls back on paths if the inode number has changed).\n\n\nThis is a bit of PITA. Is there way to do something like \"touch --assign-new-random-inode [name of directory]\" so I don't need to duplicate and delete a lot of directories (easy to make a manual mistake here)?\n\nA: There is no syscall to change inode numbers directly. So what I would do to accomplish what you probably want is something like\nfor d in <list of impacted directories>; do\n    cd \"$d\"\n    for f in *; do\n        cp \"$f\" foo\n        rm \"$f\"\n        mv foo \"$f\"\n    done\n    cd ..\ndone\n\nMaking this fail-proof and avoid data loss in case something goes wrong inside the loop is left as exercise for the reader.\n\nA: I solved this by creating an Automator service. It works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get artist, album and track number. Show the erroneous file in Finder.\n\n*Store the values above.\n\n*Find the parent of the file in (1).\n\n*chmod -x on the parent (4)\n\n*Do \"info\" on the track in iTunes. Since the file is inaccessible due to (4) iTunes asks me to locate it.\n\n*chmod +x on the parent (4)\n\n*Since my music is sorted /Artist/Album/ I use the values stored above to do a naive guess where it might be to save me some manual labour to browse to the correct folder\n\n*Manually verify that the correct file is selected.

It all runs smoothly and works fine except for the WiFi. \nThe internet connection breaks frequently (which means that I am not able to access the internet). I am though still connected to the WLAN network at any time (often it says \"no internet, secured\"). Disconnecting and reconnecting to the WLAN network is the only way to get it back to working. I noticed the same behaviour in different networks.

(For example Broadcom 3502) and then go to the manufacturers website and download the latest Win 10 drivers for that make and model.\nThe tricky part may come if device manager only shows hardware IDs. In that case you may have some success Googling those particular numbers.\nAgain I don't know if that will solve your specific problem but I have solved similar problems with other versions of Windows on other Macs using this technique.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on my iMac with Bootcamp (iMac 5k, Windows 10 build 1511, Bootcamp 6).

Since 10.7 was released, there have been some big changes to the rules for macOS drivers (kernel extensions, or kexts).\nThe two biggest changes are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel extensions must be signed (unless you disable the signature check, which is enforced by System Integrity Protection)\n\n*3rd-party extension now need to be in /Library/Extensions, rather than /System/Library/Extensions.\n\n\nMost-likely System Integrity Protection will prevent you from installing the driver, and even if you put the Kext in the right place, it may not be signed properly or even compatible.\nSo it's probably not even possible.\n", "Q: How can I set hourly reminder in Mac?

I am looking for best practices or official/recommended sources for an image that is packaged with the macOS host OS in mind.\nI have downloaded VirtualBox, and first looked for macOS-friendly pre-built images. Top web searches lead to sources like osboxes.org, however their VDI images are .7z-compressed. macOS doesn't come with a 7z decompressor out-of-the-box. I could install one (The Unarchiver, Keka, etc.), however the macOS-unfriendly compression makes me wonder whether I'm looking at the wrong sources, and if there are other macOS-friendly sources for Linux virtual images (or whether there is another process that I should be following).\nWhat are the preferred sources/methods for installing VirtualBox images on macOS 10.12?\n\nA: I would say that in-general, the preferred method of getting a virtual machine image would be to create it yourself by installing the operating system fresh from the distribution's installer.

Since you can see your credit card information in the Apple Watch app on iOS, this means that the data is synced across both devices.\nDue to the data being  on the watch and  phone, would this make it possible for an hacker to get my card details? If so, would it just be the last four digits and my bank provider or all details?\n\nA: [EDIT] - This edit revises my answer to:\n\n*\n\n*more specifically answer the OP's question for their exact scenario\n\n*reduce ambiguity by making clearer the parts of my answer that were more general in nature\n\n1. Answer to OP's exact question/scenario\nYes, your payment details are 100% safe, as you've already set up Apple Pay on your devices prior to doing a jailbreak in future. This is because your card information is not saved to the device. In other words, since the data isn't on the device to begin with, there's no risk of it being accessed from your iPhone, even after doing a jailbreak. The information simply isn't there to steal!\n2. Apple's own words re encryption and data protection on jailbroken devices\nAccording to Apple\n\nThe secure boot chain, code signing, and runtime process security all\nhelp to ensure that only trusted code and apps can run on a device.\niOS has additional encryption and data protection features to\nsafeguard user data, even in cases where other parts of the security\ninfrastructure have been compromised (for example, on a device with\nunauthorized modifications). This provides important benefits for both\nusers and IT administrators, protecting personal and corporate\ninformation at all times and providing methods for instant and\ncomplete remote wipe in the case of device theft or loss.\n\nSource: Apple's iOS Security White Paper, 2014, p8. NOTE: Bold emphasis mine, not Apple's.\nAs you can see, according to Apple, even jailbreaking a device will not result in non-trusted code or apps being able to access certain areas, such as the Secure Enclave.\nMore specifically, Apple states:\n\nThe Secure Enclave is a coprocessor fabricated in the Apple A7 chip.\nIt utilizes its own secure boot and personalized software update\nseparate from the application processor. It also provides all\ncryptographic operations for Data Protection key management and\nmaintains the integrity of Data Protection even if the kernel has\nbeen compromised.\n\nSource: Apple's iOS Security White Paper, 2014, p5. NOTE: Bold emphasis mine, not Apple's.\nThe Secure Enclave is part of Apple's A7 and later processors. This enclave is documented in Apple Patent Application 20130308838 and also has its own OS called SEP OS.\nSo, according to Apple, your data is safe.\n3. General info about Apple Pay and security\nThe best way to enter your card information when setting up Apple Pay is to use your iPhone's camera. This is because doing so means your card information is never saved to the device or stored to the photo library. In other words, since the data isn't on the device to begin with, there's no risk of it being accessed from your iPhone.\nOnce you've set up your device for Apple Pay, your bank (or financial institution) creates a Device Account Number (DAN) which is unique to your device and is encrypted and sent to Apple so they can add it to what's called the Secure Element on your device. This element is totally isolated from iOS and watchOS, is never stored on Apple's servers, nor backed up to iCloud.\nIt's important to also note that the DAN is never actually decrypted by Apple, they merely perform the action of placing it on your device in its encrypted form.\nIf you have to manually enter your card information (i.e instead of using your iPhone's camera), this information is also encrypted and sent to Apple servers. Since the information is stored on your iPhone prior to encryption it is theoretically possible that a 3rd party could log this, but the risk of this happening on a non-jailbroken device is 0% because the data (i.e. your card info):\n\n*\n\n*is stored in encrypted memory\n\n*only stored for a very short period (a few seconds at most)\n\n*is protected by AES key wrapping with both sides providing a random key that establishes the session key and uses AES-CCM transport encryption.\n\nIn summary, I don't think it is possible to absolutely 100% guarantee that a hacker could never retrieve your card details, but in reality the risk of this happening is actually from a hacker breaching your bank's systems instead, not from your iPhone.\n4.

There would be no way to know what part of the data might be approximated, which is why archive software use lossless compression.\n\nA: No, all of the compression methods supported in the .zip file format are lossless. See Wikipedia. \n\nA: The zip format does not use lossy compression, but the zip command is lossy in a different sense -- it does not include some kinds of Mac-specific file metadata in the archive. The metadata that gets left off is mostly unimportant. I'm talking about things like file tags, Spotlight comments, and such. Mostly.\nIf that's not good enough for you, you can use ditto, with the appropriate options.

It is a common issue Mac users, when you try open NTFS external storage you allowed only read mode. And of course there are some solution. One of them it is NTFS 3G - free alternative.\nI followed instructions \nhttps://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/NTFS-3G\nI set up FUSE then I set up Brew and eventually I set up NTFS 3G\nBut because lack of experience in Mac and English I can't understand what I need to do after all\nAccording to link \n\nEven though you have installed NFTS-3G, newly connected NTFS volumes will still be auto-mounted in read-only mode. To change this you need to replace Apple's NTFS mount tool /sbin/mount_ntfs with the one provided by NTFS-3G.\n\nIt says that I need to replace Apple's NTFS mount tool with the one provided by NTFS-3G... \nHow to do it? I don't know any tools provided by NTFS-3G...\nPlease help me to finish installing process\nEdit\nI found this two commands to solve my issue \nsudo mv \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/sbin/mount_ntfs\" \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/sbin/mount_ntfs.orig\"\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/sbin/mount_ntfs\"\n\nAfter I execute first command I got follow output \nmv: rename /Volumes/Macintosh HD/sbin/mount_ntfs to /Volumes/Macintosh HD/sbin/mount_ntfs.orig: No such file or directory\n\nAfter I execute second command I got follow output\nln: /Volumes/Macintosh HD/sbin/mount_ntfs: No such file or directory\n\nEdit2\nAdmins-MacBook-Pro:~ admin$ sudo mv \"/sbin/mount_ntfs\" \"/sbin/mount_ntfs.orig\"\n\nPassword:\n\nmv: rename /sbin/mount_ntfs to /sbin/mount_ntfs.orig: Operation not permitted\n\n\nA: Operations need to be done in a particular state: by disabling System Integrity Protection. See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/213575/62697\nHere is the relevant part:\n\n\n\n*Link NTFS-3G to boot after temporary disabling System Integrity Protection, as follow:\n\n[reboot by holding CMD+R to get in recovery mode]\n   csrutil disable\n\n[reboot normally]\n   sudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.original\n   sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs\n\n[reboot by holding CMD+R to get in recovery mode]\n   csrutil enable\n\n[reboot normally]\n\nNote: If the mv command fails with No such file or directory, then it's not a problem, just ignore it. The important command is the ln command.\n\nA: Alternative approach - may be unstable or cause data corruption\nWhile you can use NTFS-3G for accessing NTFS drives, it should be noted that recent versions of macOS support writing to NTFS drives natively. This option however is hidden from the GUI and you'd normally need the terminal to do it:\nsudo mount -t ntfs -o rw,auto,nobrowse /dev/disk3s1 ~/ntfs-volume\n\nUwe Hollatz created Mounty, which is a nifty tool to automate this process. It sits in your taskbar waiting for NTFS drives to be detected.\n\nIf you use Homebrew, install it with the following command:\nbrew cask install mounty\n\nOtherwise, download the DMG from its website.\n", "Q: How to delete photos to free up space? My wife's iphone is full. I decided to free up some space by removing the photos. I connected iphone to PC and copied over complete photo collection. Then I disconnected the device and started removing each single photo by hand! Well, because you just can't select all and remove photos from your device in 2016 unless it is Android, Windows or Blackberry phone. So, after spending enough time to delete 1.5k photos by hand, I removed them from \"recently deleted\" folder only to see that the available space is 0 bytes. I restarted the phone. Tried to take a photo, no luck. The iphone refuses to take a picture because there is not enough space on the device. This is peculiar because I have zero photos according to \"camera roll\". So, now, I can't neither install an new app nor take photos, ffs Carl!\nI am literally laughing while writing this because the question is so dumb simple I've never expected to ask. How to actually remove the photos from iphone to free some space?\nThis is iphone-4 with iOS 9.3.5.\nSome screenshots.\n  \n\n\n\nA: Can you also click on Photos & Camera in Storage, and show us what it says there?\nThe photo files may be from Photo Stream. The fast way to take care of that would be to turn of Photo Stream on the iPhone, but keep in mind that will prevent future pictures from being sent to Photo Stream.\n\n", "Q: Installing Windows 10 to an External Hard Drive SSD I have a 2016 MacBook Pro, with Touch Bar, running macOS Sierra (10.12.2). I am trying to install Windows 10 to a new external SSD using Boot Camp Assistant. \nI have read numerous methods detailing how to complete this installation, including this great thread. \nUnder macOS Sierra, this seems to be different. For example, when I run Boot Camp Assistant in macOS Sierra, the first screen is the standard introduction screen, and the second screen jumps right into the partition screen. I have no ability to download any software, or even to select my target drive. \n\nThis is as far as I have gone because I do not want to modify the partition of my internal drive. \nAlso, here is a screenshot of Disk Utility where you can see my external SSD currently partitioned and ready. I am wanting to install Windows 10 on the 100GB W10 partition (MS-DOS). The drive is plugged in, but Boot Camp Assistant does not recognize it (or allow me to select it as an install destination). \n\nAny ideas?\nUpdate 1: \nI tried to get around this problem by trying to ignore Boot Camp Assistant altogether and just installing WindowsToGo on my SSD. \nNo luck. I eventually thought the problem might be because the SSD is split in 2 partitions, and maybe Mac doesn't like that. So I wiped the whole drive and installed WindowsToGo on the single partition using this guide. Everything appeared to install fine, but the MacBook will not recognize the drive when booting. \nUpdate 2: \nI thought I might be doing something wrong, so I tried using AAOMEI Partition Assistant Standard (which automates the WindowsToGo installation). Same problem. Everything on the drive looks fine, but the Mac won't recognize it as a bootable drive. \n\nA: It seems to be a bug (or feature) in 10.12.2 that macOS will not recognize an external SSD when booting.\nI have installed Win10 via WindowsToGo several months ago on an external SSD, when my macOS version is 10.11. Everything was fine when I upgraded to 10.12 and 10.12.1, but at the stage of 10.12.2, the external disk cannot be recognized anymore during booting.\nAt current no solution is provided by Apple. I suggest that you roll back to 10.12.1 or earlier versions if you are eager to do the installation.\nEDIT: I happened to boot the external SSD successfully several times for 10.12.2 by cutting off all the network connections (wireless and ethernet).\n\nA: Came across a post with the solution how to just download the drivers here.

As the MacBook Pro 2016 series supports various USB PD profiles, I'm wondering whether they will also charge using other USB standards, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB Type-C, 1.5A or 3.0A at 5V using the passive marking resistor (not PD)\n\n*USB Type-A using an A to C cable, connected to a USB BC DCP at up to 1.5 A (for example newer iPhone or most Android compatible chargers)\n\n*USB Type-A, connected to an iPad charger at 2.1 A or 2.4 A (using Apple's proprietary D+/D- voltage handshake)\n\n\nI'm aware that most of these will not be able to supply enough power for normal operation of the computer, but being able to charge slowly while in standby would still be useful.\n\nA: After some experimentation with a 2016 15\" MBP, it seems that they are very flexible:\nA USB charger capable of 5 V, 2.4 A proprietary Apple signalling was recognized as providing 12 W of power, and an iPhone charger (which complies the USB BC specification) was shown as providing 5 W. The Nexus 5X charger, which provides USB-C 5 V, 3 A charging, was also correctly recognized as providing 15 W.\nThe power settings were showing these as \"not charging\" with the Mac running, but it turns out that even the large 15\" MBP is capable of slowly charging from the tiny 5 V, 1 A adapter (it went up by about 2% after charging in sleep mode for about half an hour).\n\nA: I was able to charge my MBP 2017 with the Nintendo Switch power supply, which offers a dual 5V-1.5A / 15V-2.6A output. MacBook negotiates the 15V output and gets 39W of power, which charged my Mac in approximately 3 hours while using it.\nJust in case someone lands in this page while trying to find alternatives to a forgotten power supply \n\nA: I know this post is old but I wanted to add my 2 cents. While it is true that while using your macbook pro, you should use their recommended 61w or 87w (13 or 15 inch respectively) charger. If you are in a situation like mine where you have bought a new charger online because you lost your old one, and you are desperate for a charge even if it is overnight while the laptop is powered off, I have found that my 15w samsung adaptive fast charging brick and included type c cable can provide a trickle charge to boost battery life. I think I was able to charge 15% in 2 hours while not turned off or while in sleep mode. Definitely do not recommend and should only be used in emergencies, but the option is there. Not sure if this is what OP meant but this is a situation I have found myself in and I referenced this post to see if any ideas were here. Didn't find this exact suggestion but similar comments led me to try it and it worked.\nTL;DR\nUse a 15w phone charger to trickle charge your macbook pro when it is turned off.\nThank you, hold your applause.\n", "Q: AirPort Express - Create Network or Extend Network? I have 1 Airport Extreme (newer version) and 3 AirPort Express's (1st gen) in my house. I understand that physically connecting all 3 Express's over ethernet and setting to \"Create Network\" is the best option (according to this article), however they are not all 3 in range of ethernet.  \nSo my question is: What is the difference/impact between the \"Create Network\" and \"Extend Network\" options when the AirPort Express is not physically connected?\nI would think that \"Create Network\" in this case would literally create new wireless networks and make the situation much worse.  Is that not true?\n\nA: Choosing \"Extend Network\" will greatly reduce the bandwidth (read: download speeds) available to your devices connected via Wifi, since one router has to relay data to the next wirelessly.\nApple has a good support article on extending your network, the various choices and the impact it has. \"In the case of a wirelessly extended network, throughput may be reduced to less than 60 percent of that of a single device.\": https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202056\nSince, as you say, you cannot interconnect your three Airports via Ethernet, the only choice is to extend. You can only \"Create a New Network\" if your Airport can reach your Internet router/modem via Ethernet. \nIf you have an ethernet connection to all three Airport routers, then creating a new network, even with the same name will give you better bandwidth, since the three routers should configure itself to be on different bands (or you could manually configure separate bands with the Airport utility as well). \n\nA: Creating a new network means that the base station is offering a wireless network for you to connect to. From there the data that you're sending or requesting has to somehow reach the internet. Since the base station isn't connected to anything else, the data has nowhere to go. You'd have established a very small local network with exactly two devices in it: the base station and your laptop (for example).\nIf you want the base station to offer a wireless network and also itself to connect to the internet wirelessly, you'll have to extend an existing wireless network which is connected to the internet. This will make the base station act as a wireless repeater; it'll take the signal of the existing internet-connected wireless network and boost/repeat its signal to physically reach further (broadly speaking). Note that the further you stretch this, the slower your data throughput will become. Speaking anecdotally, extending a network by one hop typically works fairly well though.\n\nA: What about using Netgear Nighthawk R7000 Wireless Router, connected directly to a modem, and joining two Airport express units connected \nby 50’ long Ethernet to router plus the Time Capsule on 2’ Ethernet cable and having all three “Create a Network”? \n", "Q: \"o\" before recent phone number, what does it mean I just realized I got some recent contacts who have an \"o\" before their phone numbers when I'm adding a recipient after writting a text message, what does it mean?\nI'm sure it's the letter \"o\" and not a zero because it appears when I search for \"o\" when adding a recipient. And it doesn't appear as capital letter before the number, it appears like \"o961231234\" and those contacts are not on my list, but they do appear as recent contacts.\nPlease, I'd really appreciate if somebody could answer this\n\nA: The letter 'O' before a telephone number is for OFFICE.\n'F' for FAX \n", "Q: iOS 10 app restrictions Is there a way that I can make it that you have to put a password or fingerprint when opening apps on my iPhone? \nFor instance, if I give the phone to someone and they want to try to open apps that I do not want them to use, the owner's passcode or fingerprint would required to use that app?\n\nA: This has been a long \"want\" of iPhone users. The closest thing you can do to this is:\nGo to Settings > General > Restrictions\nEnable restrictions. \nYou can then enter a password, (can be different from your regular pass code), and you are able to restrict certain apps and features, but not everything.

While I'm on the train using my AirPods with my Mac, how do I accept a call from my iPhone over the AirPods while using my iPhone as a Wi-Fi hotspot?\n\nA: This isn't currently possible as AirPods connect to one device at a time and your Mac isn't able to accept calls unless it is on the same Wi-Fi network as your phone (Hotspot doesn't count).\nUntil one of those changes you'll have to ask the caller to \"give me a minute to put on my headphones\" (common practice) while you open Bluetooth settings on your iPhone (fastest: swipe up control center and choose AirPods in AirPlay) and connect to your AirPods. The call will automatically route to your AirPods once connected!\n--\nAlternatively you could get a bluetooth device such as the Bose QuietComfort 35 which allows you to connect up to two devices so you could be connected to both your iPhone and Mac and switch easily between them!\n", "Q: Trying to use launchd to make my iMac running 10.7.5 to email me it´s IP address not working This is the first time I use launchd so there´s a lot I don´t know.\nA little bit of background info.\nI set up everyting to be able to use the mail command to send emails with my gmail.

The main problem seems to be that the Micro-B connection on the control board in the enclosure is not very sturdy and I have had to keep the cable at angle to maintain connection.  This is very far below optimal and worried it could lead to damaging the drive.\nBought USB SATA dock (powered externally and can handle 3TB, already checked that, and have used it for other drives since then and it reads the others fine as they were in their other enclosures) and received a \"the disk you inserted was not readable by this computer\" dialog box with the option to initialize, ignore and eject.  I figured maybe it was a problem with the dock so I bought a full enclosure.\nInstalled in new enclosure (non-Seagate, but rated for 3TB and beyond and external power) and having the same issue.  If I get the controller from the original Seagate enclosure that I bought the drive in and manage to get the Micro-B to work at JUST the right angle to read the drive then it registers as the normal drive and sees everything, including the TimeMachine partition, properly.\nWhat can I do to resolve this?  And what about the control board from that enclosure (or whatever is causing the issue) is causing my Mac to recognize it when it's connected to that but nothing else?\nThe screenshots below are from when I've plugged it in with the new enclosure, but the same errors appear when I used the dock.  \nA few notes:\n- It doesn't even give me the option to 'Verify Disk' or 'Repair Disk' which similar (but not the same) issues seem to be resolved by\n- I don't have another way to access this data (external and TimeMachine) so simply formattting without transfering it first isn't an option, I neeed some way to access it to copy it to a new drive at least first if that's the only way.\n- Running OS X 10.8.5 and this is the only computer I've used this drive on.\n\n\nA: Answer from bwDraco on SuperUser\nThis version posted as Community Wiki\n\nThe enclosure exposes the drive to the computer as an Advanced Format 4Kn device, allowing the use of MBR for compatibility with\nWindows XP systems. When the drive is removed from the enclosure, the\n  change in logical sector format results in an invalid partition table.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*External hard drives larger than 2 TiB in capacity often expose 4K sectors directly to the operating system. The 2 TiB limit commonly\n  associated with MBR is tied to the traditional 512-byte sector size;\n  4K sectors are eight times as large and therefore extend the MBR limit\n  to 16 TiB. This allows the use of MBR on disks larger than 2 TiB in\n  capacity, enabling use on Windows XP and other systems which do not\n  support GPT.\n  \n*The underlying hard drive uses 512-byte sector emulation for compatibility with legacy systems. This means that while the disk\n  physically has 4K sectors, the immediate host device (in this case,\n  the enclosure) sees 512-byte sectors. However, to perform the\n  aforementioned MBR expansion and enable Windows XP compatibility, the\n  enclosure makes the drive appear to the computer as having 4K native\n  sectors.\n  \n*When the drive is removed from the enclosure, the 512-byte logical sectors of the underlying 512e disk are exposed. This results in an\n  invalid partition table that cannot be correctly interpreted. The\n  746.52 GiB value you gave for the last \"partition\" when the drive is connected directly is precisely the amount of space that lies beyond\n  the 2 TiB limit for MBR drives with 512-byte sectors.\nMore details about the implications of this conversion are available\n  in this blog post.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro with Touch ID sometimes unlocks without any authentication My MacBook Pro with TouchBar is set up to use Touch ID, requires authentication after sleeping, has File Vault turned on… the complete works.

If you look at a list of open processes, either in the Activity Monitor, or in Terminal with the TOP command, why are the assigned PID numbers not all used sequentially. \nFor example, is this because some processes with certain PID numbers have run and since ceased running, leaving a gap in sequential PID assigned numbers of existing running processes, or are their unlisted processes not visible in the Terminal tops command, or some other reason? \nMy understanding that after initial start up with PID numbers 0, 1 and a few more are assigned, PID numbers are then allocated from 100. As presented by:\nAD: What's the maximum pid for Mac OS X?\nAnd Wikipedia: Process Identifier. \n\nA: Process numbers are assigned sequentially, starting with 1. The kernel is sort-of considered to be process #0, but it's not really a process, so this is a special case. It does not skip ahead to 100; that's something different. The gaps you see in the sequence are indeed due to processes that have finished. Most processes are sort-lived; they start, do some specific task, and then when the task is finished they exit.\nAs for that \"100\" figure, that has to do with what happens after 99,998 processes have started. That's the maximum PID, so at that point the system has \"run out of numbers\" and starts re-using them starting at 100. But this'll occur only after your computer has been running for quite a while, not during initial startup. It can take months or even years without a reboot before you run out of PIDs and restart from 100.\n", "Q: What are these two keys, ⇞ and ⇟? I see keyboard shortcuts in the menu of Brackets.

I signed out then signed back in with my new email address . Would this cause me to have lost contacts & pics? \n\nA: Yes, if you haven't changed your primary email on your iCloud account from the \"then\" email address to the \"new\" email address, logging in with a different email means you are now probably using different Apple ID all together and are seeing the contacts and pictures –or lack of them– of this Apple ID.  \nThe proper way to change your Apple ID main email address is described here:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Sign out of every Apple service and device that uses your Apple ID.\n  \n*Sign in to your Apple ID account page.\n  \n*In the Account section, click Edit. Under your Apple ID, click Change Email Address. You might be asked to answer one or more of your security questions.\n  \n*Enter the email address that you want to use as your Apple ID. A verification code will be sent to your new email address.\n  \n*Enter the verification code from the email into the fields provided and start using your updated Apple ID.\n  \n*Sign back in to all Apple services with your new Apple ID.\n  After you change your Apple ID, you need to use your new sign-in information with all Apple services that you use.\n  \n\nAdditionally, you're probably going to have trouble using the \"new\" email address now, given you cannot use the same email address for two Apple ID's. If you run into that problem, please ask another question (the solution probably involves adding a third email address to the \"new\" Apple ID, making it the primary email address, and deleting the \"new\" email address in order to make it available for use again). \nSorry, there is no solution to the last part, apparently: Remove an email address from apple-ID\n", "Q: iTunes home sharing videos with iOS 10.2 TV app I have videos in iTunes on my Mac desktop (in the TV Shows and Movies sections) that are shared using Home Sharing with my Apple ID. Home sharing is turned on and working; I can watch the videos on my Apple TV.\nI used to use Apple's Videos app to watch on my iPhone. As of iOS 10.2, Videos seems to be gone, nominally replaced with TV. Apple's instructions for Home Sharing, published Dec 6, 2016, refer to Videos and don't mention TV at all.\nI don't see any obvious way to watch shared videos with the TV app. I went to its Settings pane and signed out of my Apple ID and back in, but still nothing. The Settings pane does explicitly list Home Sharing, which suggests that it should be possible, but I am stumped.\nHow can I watch videos shared from iTunes using Home Sharing on my iPhone with iOS 10.2?\n\nA: The TV app will show all iTunes libraries that are shared under the same Home Sharing account right on the \"front page\"\nWhen you start the app, you should be on the \"Library\" tab (check tab at bottom, you have \"Library\", \"Watch Now\", \"Store\" and \"Search\").\nYour home sharing libraries will be listed on the Library page, you have  \"TV Shows\", \"Movies\" and then the name of your library, with the name you picked in iTunes' General Preferences, Library Name. If you have more than one iTunes instance running on your network, and they're all shared on the same account, they will all show up there.\n\nA: I found that once i downloaded a free tv episode my shared library showed up. \n\nA: I have multiple devices for the family with multiple accounts, all of which share the same Home Sharing account. It used to work, and does on my personal device, but not the rest of the family sharing the same home sharing account.

The mouse is responsive, but nothing is drawn. In previous upgrades, I could get past this by holding SHIFT for safe mode; and then the upgrade would complete. Not this time. There are no USB devices except the keyboard plugged in. I've reset PRAM/NVRAM, no change. I can boot to recovery. Any other suggestions?\n\nA: I experienced the same white screen issue after updating to 10.12.2 and was forced to restore from a previous time machine backup (after trying to repair the drive, resetting the PRAM/NVRAM and booting safe mode failed to work).  Stupidly, I tried updating to 10.12.2 again on the restored version and during the reboot process it went back to the white screen.\nDon't install 10.12.2 if you have this issue. \n", "Q: Open all iCloud tabs from iPhone on Mac TLDR; Is there a way to simultaneously open all iCloud tabs saved on iPhone, on a Mac?\nI use my iPhone for browsing and as a means of \"read it later\" I just leave the open tabs there with the purpose of opening them all later on my Mac. Is there a way to open them all (much like Chrome allows in the \"Tabs from other devices\" in History page)? \n\nA: Assuming you don't require them to open literally simultaneously, but simply rapidly, this is quite doable.\nFirst, add the iCloud Tabs icon () to your Safari toolbar, if it isn't there already. To do this, right-click the toolbar, select \"Customize Toolbar…\", and drag the icon to where you want it.\n\nOnce the icon is in your toolbar, click it. A list of tabs open on your other devices will appear. To quickly open lots or all of these pages in Safari, simply hold down the command key (⌘) while you click each site you want to open.\nCommand-clicking a link, bookmark, or other reference to a page will, by default, open it in a background tab. If you find, when you command-click one of the items in the list, that it opens in the foreground and closes the iCloud Tabs menu, either shift-command-click, or deselect \"When a new tab or window opens, make it active\" in Safari's tab preferences (Safari > Preferences… > Tabs).\nEdit: The third-party tool CloudyTabs is a menu bar application which includes the ability to open all your iCloud tabs at once. (h/t Matt Sephton for finding it!)\n\nA: One option that may work indirectly if you can easily locate the segment in time in which you were browsing on the other device is to use the History view, then you can select a range of tabs using shift+click and/or cmd+click, and then you can hold cmd and double-click to open all in tabs.\n", "Q: Unable to reinstall OS X on Macbook Air despite trying several different methods I'm out of ideas... Tried every suggestion I could find on the net, but nothing worked. Hoping someone here has a different idea.\nThe situation \nI'm trying to reinstall OS X (Lion, or higher -- which version doesn't matter to me right now) on a Macbook Air, 11-inch, Late 2010 model. \nThe machine came with OS X Lion pre-installed, and has been upgraded up to El Capitan while I used it.\nI recently decided to give the MBA away. Before doing so, I erased the default system/home partition with Disk Utility in Recovery Mode.\nI have now been trying to re-install OS X on the MBA, but didn't succeed.\nThings I tried already\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning on the machine, i.e. regular startup: Bootup stops at question mark screen. No surprise, since the system partition has been erased.\n\n*Turning on with cmd-R, i.e. regular recovery mode. No visible progress for about 30 seconds, i.e. grey screen, then automatically switch to Internet recovery mode. Seems to suggest that there's no recovery partition, or it's not recognized, right?\n\n*Turning on with cmd-option-R, i.e. using Internet recovery mode directly. Mac OS X Utilities menus load, no problem here. Selecting option 2, \"Reinstall Mac OS X\", I am offered to install OS X Lion 10.7 (the original OS the machine was shipped with). Pressing \"ok\" is followed by message \"To download and restore Mac OS X, you computer's eligibility will be verified with Apple\". \"ok\", followed by progress report \"Loading Installation Information\", then dialog to confirm license agreement, then dialog to select installation disk. After that, I am asked to sign into the App Store. This step is not optional in my case, i.e. I cannot skip the app store sign-in. Once I sign in, installation fails with error message: \"This item is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.\" \n\n*Checking Disk Utility, I see there's no recovery partition. Not 100% sure why, since I didn't erase it, but given that I got the MBA from someone else as well, it is possible that partition was erased earlier.\n\n*Last thing I tried: Recovery Disk Assistant on my working Macbook Pro to create recovery USB. Using USB on MBA at boot up leads to the regular boot up progress bar going about halfway, then stopping at an error screen (box with an \"X\" inside). Perhaps because the computer I used to create the USB runs El Capitan, while MBA came with Lion.\nSummary\nTrying to re-install OS X on Macbook Air after erasing default system partition.\nRecovery partition missing, so I have to use Internet recovery.\nInternet recovery installation fails as follows: \n(1) I am forced to sign into app store when reinstalling OS X Lion (weird, since other people suggest app store sign-in is not necessary when reinstalling original OS). \n(2) After signing in, I get the error \"This item is temporarily unavailable.\"\n\nA: The best thing you can do is to create a bootable USB disk with any new OS X of your choice. Please see Apple support page to create a bootable disk. I guess, it will solve your installation issues with your MBA.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\n", "Q: How to fix slow trackpad: OSX 10.12.2 I just installed the latest patch for Sierra, so am now on 10.12.2. Post-upgrade my pointer controlled through trackpad runs very slow when I open the laptop. I can fix it by opening System Preferences -> Trackpad -> Point & Click, and just moving the \"Tracking speed\" slider a notch and then back to where I want it. But the fix doesn't seem to persist, so I have to do this every time I wake the machine. Does anyone know how to fix the issue permanently?\nUpdate: using a mouse works fine regardless of trackpad state. Further, opening a full-screen application resets the trackpad back to being slow, so it's not just when the computer goes to sleep :(\n\nA: I would try resetting both the SMC and PRAM/NVRAM.\nSMC\nThe instructions for resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) will differ depending on whether your computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*runs from a built-in battery?\n\n*runs from a removable battery? \n\n*can only run from power off a wall socket?\n\n\nSince you haven't specified your computer I will provide the instructions for all three possibilities.\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (or power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Disconnect the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer\n\n*Remove the battery\n\n*Press the power button for 5 seconds and release\n\n*Put the battery back in\n\n*Reconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nFor iMacs, Mac Pros, Mac Minis, etc that only run from a power point in the wall\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Unplug it from power\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds\n\n*Plug it back in and turn it on.\n\n\nPRAM/NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM).

It looks somewhat like the first picture below, except that it has one ring on the audio jack instead of the usual three.\nSo, I have purchased a splitter cable, like the second picture below, with three rings so that my MacBook would recognize the mic.\nWhen I go into System Preferences > Sound > Output it says Headphones are inserted into Headphone Port, which is correct. Unplugging it turns it back into the default Built-in Internal Speakers. However, under audio input it still says it is using the Internal Microphone. Other sound programmes such as Adobe Audition also do not recognize the mic, but recognize the speakers plugged in. Why is this so?\nNote: The cable and the microphone work perfectly on a PC, so there are no problems with the splitter cable and/or the microphone.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: The splitter in your photo has a TRRS jack, which is often called \"4-pole\" or \"4 position\" because of its 4 metal sections separated by 3 bands.  \nTRRS enables both stereo output as well as microphone input.  (Earbuds from iPhone 6 use this type of jack.)\nYour MacBook Air (although I'm not familiar with yours in particular) probably has a TRRS port (rather than one port for microphone and a separate port for headphones).  So you could plug iPhone earbuds (which have a mic) into that port.\nThe lavalier mic shown in your photo appears to have a TRRS jack and so would probably work with your MacBook Air without even using an adapter.\nHowever, you said that you own a different one and that yours has only \"one ring\". \nI would agree with your assumption that plugging a 1-pole mic jack into that adapter and plugging the adapter into your MacBook Air should work.\nMany people online are reporting problems with this MacBook Air port, however. \nSee my unanswered question here: External mic not working anymore on Macbook Air\nBy clicking the links mentioned in my question and comments, you might stumble onto some hacks relating to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Putting your computer to sleep after plugging your mic in\n\n*The order in which you plug your mic into your adapter and your adapter into your laptop\n\n*Whether and when to plug headphones into the adapter\n\n*and more\n\n\nI have not yet found a reliable repeatable solution but wanted to share what I've come across so far, and I hope it helps you (and others).\n", "Q: Can not add invitees to a calendar event after the event has been created I can not find a way to add an invitee after the event has been created and the invite emails sent.

There is no way to click the list. After the event is created, all the editing functions (changing time, changing notes, adding invitees, etc) are not clickable to edit.\n\nA: I did eventually find a solution: I logged into the external calendar via browser (in my case, exchange/Outlook) and could edit there.  Apple 'Calendar' (formerly iCal) would create the event for exchange, but after a step or two could not edit, or even cancel with notifications.  (Again, I would reply to the earlier solution not working, but I can't add comment there.)\n\nA: I think I figured out the reason. I found out this statement in Apple support page (https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/if-you-cant-change-a-calendar-or-event-on-mac-icl1033/mac):\n\nIf you can’t change an event you created, or you can’t change your\n  status for an event you were invited to, it might be because you’re\n  using an email address in Calendar that isn’t on your card in\n  Contacts. Make sure all your email addresses are listed on your\n  Contacts card. See Edit contacts.\n\nI decided to completely remove my Exchange account from the Internet Accounts on my mac. Then when signing again, I used as an email address my full email address: firstname.lastname@company.com and when signing to my account (via Microsoft web login) we need to use the shorter version of the email (in our company): username@company.com. It seems the problem lied in that I used short version of the email for the default email address in my calendar, which caused some permission issues etc. Hope this helps someone.\n", "Q: iCloud notes deleted after I turned off Notes for Mail on my iPhone I am a writer and have (or had, rather) many valuable writings in my Notes app. However, the notes made duplicates of themselves.

I did some searching but the advice is old and do not solve the problem. I'm using OS X 10.6 Sierra on a MacBook Air.\n\nA: You have to update your TERMINFO file.\nThanks to wincent's video and his github pages\nWatch the video and look at his github pages, they're excellent.\nI have the following note stored on my HD:\nWe can have italics in the terminal.\nThis works in iTerm as well as Terminal.\nWe have to adapt the terminfo database to tell it to display italics.\nCreate a plain text file which contains the following:\nxterm-256color|xterm with 256 colors and italic,\n  sitm=\\E[3m, ritm=\\E[23m,\n  use=xterm-256color,\n\nSave it as xterm-256color.terminfo.txt\nThen execute the following command:\ntic -o ~/.terminfo xterm-256color.terminfo.txt\n\nThis will create a ~/.terminfo/some_arbitrary_number/ directory, and inside that directory is a xterm-256color file.\nWhat it does according to the manpage:\n       The command tic translates a terminfo file from source format into com-\n       piled  format.   The  compiled  format  is  necessary  for use with the\n       library routines in ncurses(3X).\n\n       The results are  normally  placed  in  the  system  terminfo  directory\n       /usr/share/terminfo.  There are two ways to change this behavior.\n\n       First, you may override the system default by setting the variable TER-\n       MINFO in your shell environment to a valid (existing) directory name.\n\n       Secondly, if tic cannot get access to /usr/share/terminfo or your  TER-\n       MINFO  directory,  it  looks for the directory $HOME/.terminfo; if that\n       directory exists, the entry is placed there.\n\n       Libraries that read terminfo entries are expected to check for  a  TER-\n       MINFO  directory first, look at $HOME/.terminfo if TERMINFO is not set,\n       and finally look in /usr/share/terminfo.\n\n       -o dir   Write  compiled  entries to given directory.  Overrides the TER-\n                MINFO environment variable.\n\nSo with the given command we are writing a new terminfo entry in the hidden ~/.terminfo directory. It takes the capabilities of the existing xterm-256color entry (from /usr/share/terminfo/) and adds italics mode to it.  \nTo check that the terminal does the right thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*with fish:\necho (tput sitm)'italics' (tput ritm) (tput smso)'standout'(tput rmso)\n\n\n*with bash or zsh:\necho `tput sitm`italics`tput ritm` `tput smso`standout`tput rmso`\n\nI guess at the moment most vim terminal colorschemes don't set italic as a style. To check this do:\n:hi Comment if the reply contains cterm=italic you're done.\nIf not add highlight Comment cterm=italic to your vimrc (below setting your colorscheme).\nAddendum for tmux\ntmux uses its own terminfo files, they also need to be updated to use italics.  \n\n\n*\n\n*create a tmux.terminfo.txt file which contains\n\n\n\ntmux|tmux terminal multiplexer,\n  sitm=\\E[3m, ritm=\\E[23m,\n  smso=\\E[7m, rmso=\\E[27m,\n  use=screen,\n\n\n\n*create a tmux-256color.terminfo.txt file which contains\n\n\n\ntmux-256color|tmux with 256 colors,\n  sitm=\\E[3m, ritm=\\E[23m,\n  smso=\\E[7m, rmso=\\E[27m,\n  use=screen-256color,\n \nand run the tic command.\ntic -o ~/.terminfo tmux-256color.terminfo.txt\nand\ntic -o ~/.terminfo tmux.terminfo.txt\n\nA: In addition to updating my TERMINFO, I had to make two other changes.\n\n*\n\n*Edit .vim/colors/solarized.vim as recommended in Solarized #120 to replace lines 137-157 with the following:\n if has(\"gui_running\") || ( has(\"unix\") && system(\"tput sitm\") == \"\\033[3m\" )\n     let s:terminal_italic=1\n else\n     let s:terminal_italic=0\n endif\n\n\n\n*Edit .vimrc to add the following lines using <Ctrl-v><Esc> to enter the ^[ characters.\n \" Enable italics\n set t_ZH=^[[3m\n set t_ZR=^[[23m\n\n", "Q: How to view movies stored on external drive on my iPad?

I know that I can transfer those movies to the iPad via iTunes, but the iPad is almost full.\nIs there a way where I can connect the iPad to the external HD and watch my media?\n\nA: You can connect USB devices to your iPad with one of Apple's USB camera connection adapters, but there are a number of limitations and requirements to make this work.\nThere are also drives now that are specifically designed to work with Lightning connectors — if you are viewing this page from a Google search and don't have a drive yet and want to see if you can make this work, you might want to look into buying one of them instead.\nIf you already have a non-Lightning USB drive and want to use it with your iPad, read on.\nLimitations\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive must either be externally powered (plugs into the wall) or require only a tiny amount of power. I wasn't able to find exactly how much power the port is allowed to supply, but it almost certainly won't be enough for a hard drive — flash storage/solid state only.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: It might be possible to skirt this requirement by using a USB hub which draws power from an external power supply. I wasn't able to find definitive information about whether this works, though, so do some testing before buying anything.\n\n\n*The drive must be formatted in a certain way. I don't have the kit myself, so I can't test this, but some sources claim it must be FAT/FAT32/exFAT formatted and others that it must be HFS+ formatted. NTFS definitely won't work. (This may be a variable dependent on your iOS version — test it out with another drive first that you don't mind reformatting a couple times.)\n\n\nEstablishing the physical connection\nIf you have an older iPad with the 30-pin dock connector (1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation iPad), you will need the iPad Camera Connection Kit (discontinued, but available from Amazon or other places).\nIf you have a newer iPad with a Lightning connector (any iPad Mini, Pro, Air, or the 4th generation iPad), you will need the Lightning to USB Camera Adapter ($29) or the Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter ($39). The more expensive one's only advantages are that it will allow you to charge your iPad simultaneously, and if you have a 12.9\" iPad Pro it will allow you to transfer data with USB 3 speeds.\nIf your iPad is jailbroken\nIf you're jailbroken, it's pretty easy. Simply use a file manager like Filza or iFile and view the files from there, or a media viewer like Kodi (formerly XBMC).\nIf your iPad is not jailbroken\nIf you aren't jailbroken, it is still possible to view movies on an external drive, though it necessitates that you have enough spare storage on your iPad to hold a movie, that it's fine to either reorganize or duplicate your movies, and that all your movies are already in iOS-readable formats (I wasn't able to find a list of supported formats for this, but it's a fair bet that MKVs are out, for instance).\n\n\n*\n\n*On your computer, copy the movies you want to watch to a \"DCIM\" folder at the root of the drive.\n\n*You may need to also rename the movies to something like \"DCIM_1234\" — sources vary as to whether this is a required step.\n\n*Connect the drive to your iPad with the adapter and open the Photos app.\n\n*It should now prompt you to import your media.\n\n*Select the movie(s) you want to copy to your iPad and tell them to import.\n\n*Once the import has finished, you can unplug the drive from your iPad (no \"eject\" button is necessary).\n\n*Your movies will be in the Photos app as though they were videos you took with a camera. You will need to watch them in Photos or in a third party app which can view media in your Photos library.\n\n\nIf any of the requirements of that method aren't an option, there may still be a way to do it with a third-party app, though I wasn't able to find any options in my research while writing this answer. If I find any further information about this in the future, I will update my answer to include it.\n", "Q: Texting from iPad to Android On my original iPad Air 2 I was able to send text messages to Androids. I recently had to replace my device, however (good thing I had AppleCare!).  With the new iPad, though, I can no longer send text message to Androids.  Also, I would like to not use a 3rd party app as I was able to before without a 3rd party app.\nHow do I set that up again?\n\nA: First, you will need to confirm that your iPhone is set up correctly to send and receive messages. In order to send SMS messages, you must have an iPhone that is connected to your Apple ID. You can check by going to the iPhone's Settings app -> Messages. Confirm that \"Send as SMS\" is enabled and go into Text Message Forwarding. Make sure that your iPad is there.\nNext make sure that your phone number is listed under \"Send & Receive at\". \nOn your iPad, open Settings -> Messages and make sure that the phone number is listed under \"Send & Receive At\".\n", "Q: Is there a difference regarding battery between Apple Watch 38 mm and 42 mm? Apple says here the battery power for all Apple Watches no matter which size is up to 18 hours. \nBut is there a difference regarding battery? The 42mm version has bigger display, maybe also a bigger battery? Is there any difference? I would like to buy the device with the best battery.\n\nA: Apple used to say that the larger Apple Watch ‘typically experiences longer battery life’ on their Apple Watch battery information page, however they removed this line from the page when the Apple Watch Series 2 was released.\nThe mAh specifications are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Watch (original) & Apple Watch Series 1, 38mm: 205 mAh (source)\n\n*Apple Watch (original) & Apple Watch Series 1, 42mm: 246 mAh (source)\n\n*Apple Watch Series 2, 38mm: 273 mAh (source)\n\n*Apple Watch Series 2, 42mm: 334 mAh (source)\n", "Q: iPhone detected but \"could not be identified properly\" I receive this message when I connect my iPhone to my PC:\n\nAn iPhone has been detected but it could not be identified properly. Please disconnect and reconnect the iPhone, then try again.\n\nWhen I disconnect and reconnect, the message reappears.\n\nA: Troubleshooting steps I would recommend (in order).\nIf you have access to another IOS Device with the same IOS firmware or higher, see if the PC can connect to that. If it can't connect to another device try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you have the latest version of iTunes.\n\n*Try a different USB port, a different cable.\n\n*Completely remove iTunes and try again with a fresh copy:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204275\n\n*If none of that works I would recommend backing up with another computer and then transferring your backup over if you wish to store the backup on the PC that isn't recognizing the iPhone.\n\n\nIf it does connect to another device on the same IOS version or higher.. Try the following:\n1. Evaluate if the iPhone has a damaged cable. Most iPhones (all iPhone 5 & up) have the ribbon cable running from the lighting port around the bottom right corner. If you have a damaged screen in that area chances could be that [cable][1] is damaged. You may need a new charging port assembly.\n2. Confirm that the lighting port is clean, blow it out with compressed air or carefully remove any debris that may be inside.\nIf you don't have another device to try, following the steps from the first part, then followed by the second.\nWithout knowing what type of damage specifically happened to the iPhone, I would hope that you would find a solution with the above steps. If you believe the cable could be damaged, that would be a logical issue.

Got a new grey iPhone SE for Christmas from the Verizon store. Seems to work fine except for one issue. When the phone is off (standby), any sudden motion turns the phone on, as if the home or power button were pressed.\nLet me be clear: Nothing is in contact with the power button or home button when this happens. The phone isn't getting any calls or messages or other notifications.\nThere's a passcode, so nothing bad happens, but it's unsettling to open the pocketbook and see the phone screen all lit up.\nIs this something deliberate? Can it be configured? Or is the phone just defective?\n\nA: The iOS 10 update brought the new Raise to wake function to the iPhone 6S, 7, and SE. It's completely normal but can be annoying at times.

As changes to this application are pushed to my code repository, a build server (Jenkins) automatically detects those changes and kicks off a build process. As part of that build process, I sign the generated binaries with a certificate I have received from Apple. Once that process completes, I am able to verify that the application has been properly signed by running:\n$ codesign -v ./MyApp.app\n\nHere is the strange part: If I download those binaries directly from Jenkins and copy them over to a Mac, I can run them without issue. However, if I host those binaries on a web server and download them via HTTPS, I receive the \"can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer\" error and am unable to proceed.\nCan anyone shed some light on what might be happening here?\n\nA: When you downloaded apps with Safari an extended property is set on the file to mark is as quarantined.

(Ideally, I'd like to pull them into IFTTT and then push them to a Google Spreadsheet.) Some apps may let me switch the notification method in-app, but that may also change the frequency of the notification, and in any event, it won't work across all apps and I'm looking to track the phone notification frequency. Is there some way to do this without jailbreaking? If I were to somehow push the notifications to macOS, is there a method for automatically recording them on the computer? If the version matters, I'm on the latest iOS.\n\nA: Due to iOS restrictions, apps can't read notifications.

I have 10.9.5 and it's supposed to be compatible and it didn't work. Since then, I've gotten 3 more programs from a total of 4 different places and they all do the same thing, so this isn't a problem just with one program or place. 2 of them had to be unzipped, then there was a rar file inside them that had to be extracted. The other 2 programs were marked7z; I unzipped them, then used the rar/zip extractor I got from the Apple store(i've used 4 different ones). Everything seems to work fine until I try to open the programs. I click or double-click on them, they say verifying, the bar fills, then the icon just bounces up and down on the desktop dock and the programs never open. I've uninstalled and erased everything, then downloaded them again and still same problem. They all just bounce, but never actually open. After waiting 5-10 minutes, I right-click and select force quit. I've inspected contents and everything looks fine; hash is correct; I can't figure out what's wrong. One of the programs has a .dmg and an .iso and when I click that them, they both say it isn't recognized. Am I doing something wrong with the extract/archive?\nI've never had an Apple before, but it seems like it should be easier than this to just download install and open a program.\n\nA: This is likely because the app's binary is missing the execute bit. In Terminal, run the following:\nchmod +x \"/Applications/AppName.app/Contents/MacOS/AppName\"\n\nReplace the first 'AppName' with the name of the app and second with the name of the app's binary.

I have an iPad Mini, and I have iElectribe which allows me to make music loops and render them as .wav files.  I want to use them in other apps and also store them in Dropbox or Google drive, but neither app lets me see anything but photos, videos, spreadsheets and .doc files.  \nHow on earth do you get things you make into one of those services?  P.S. I don't own a Mac.\n\nA: You can access the exported .wav files using the iTunes app on your Mac or PC when the iPad is plugged in through USB:\n\nSelect the Apps collection in the Sidebar, then scroll that window down to File Sharing. In the File Sharing list, you'll find iELECTRIBE, with all the exported .wav files. Drag the files from this list to your Desktop or folder. There seems to be no other way but to drag.\nUntil the developer creates the hooks that allow it to access Dropbox or Drive, this is the only way, other than SoundCloud.\n\nA: I am not familiar with this app but IOS apps kinda work \"backwards\" compared to how Macs and PCs works. In other words you can't open a file that then opens in the app of your choice.\nIn IOS you can only operate on a file if the app allows it. You can only open (or save) a file on IOS if the app is designed to do so. So your app needs the option to save the .wav files in Dropbox or Google Drive. If it can't you are out of luck.\nOften that will show up under the sharing button (box with an arrow pointed up) tap on that button and select what app to open it with. If it allows saving to Dropbox (or whatever...) you would have the option of sharing it with Dropbox.\nIt's an odd way of working with files if you come from a Mac or PC background but has it's own logic and makes sense once you understand the workflow.\n\nA: It looks like there are two apps that will handle this- AudioCopy (free), and AudioShare (Paid) which copy audio from one app to another.  AudioShare allows upload and download to Dropbox, converting, trimming, normalizing and converting audio.  Not ideal to have to use an app do this, but it seems pretty solid so far.\n", "Q: How can I create a running total in Apple Numbers (4.0ff)? A typical use of a spreadsheet is to create a running total, as for a checkbook register.  The usual way to do this is to simply add a current row to a prior row.  My example is a variation -- showing the accumulation of bills over time.\n\nIn text, the formula for \"Amount\" in row \"Homeowners\" is \n   ($Amount Homeowners) +  IF (ROW() = ROW($Amount $electric Nov), 0, Calculate via Prior Sum electric Nov)\n\nHowever, things get a little sticky if you want to interpose some notes (cell background red here) or whatever:\n\nIt fails in either column, and ruins all successive values\n\n\nA: The way I got around this today was to generate a range dynamically and use the SUM operation on it.  SUM ignores non-numeric entries:\n\nThe formula I use sets a fixed initial cell to start the running total, column \"Amount\" in row \"electric Nov\".  I can't use regular tricks, I need to generate the range dynamically for each row using INDIRECT.  This requires I create a string identifying the range to sum up.  This range should only go up to the current row (which is what makes it a running total).  I don't want to use fixed columns A, B, C, etc., which break if I need to shift columns around; I need to use the initial cell with the numeric column number, and I must use the \"R1C1\" cell notation instead of \"A1\".  \nSo I concatenate the (unchanging) row and column numbers from the initial cell, a colon (:) to indicate a range, and then the current row number and column number.  I have pretty-printed the formula (at least I think it's pretty!) below.\n\n    SUM (\n        INDIRECT (\n           CONCATENATE (\n               \"R\",\n               ROW ($Amount $electric Nov),\n               \"C\",\n               COLUMN($Amount $electric Nov),\n               \":\",\n               \"R\",\n               ROW(),\n               \"C\",\n               COLUMN($Amount $electric Nov)\n           ),\n           FALSE\n         )\n    )\n\nNote that this goes quite gracefully past non-numeric entries to give a reliable running total.\nI hope this helps someone out there!\n\nA: *\n\n*Fill one cell with =SUM and select the cell above, and cell to the left of the cumulative cell. Hit the green tick.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select that cumulative cell, and copy it.

What I have found is that using the trackpad to move \"back\" and \"forwards\" between webpages, goes in the opposite direction to what I would expect.\nFor example, let's say I visit webpage A, then webpage B, and then webpage C. I now want to navigate back to A, and so my natural instinct would be to swipe two fingers on the trackpad from right to left. However, it seems that doing this actually moves the webpages forwards. So, in order to navigate back to A, I actually need to swipe my two fingers from left to right.\nThis seems odd that it would be the default, because it feels much more natural that swiping to the right is forwards, and swiping to the left is backwards.\nIs this really the default setting? And if so, is there any way I can change it to the opposite?\nThanks.\n\nA: That's the default and it actually makes sense if you consider the visual metaphor of moving between pages in a book, magazine, or newspaper.  To back from C --> A in a book you swipe the pages from left to right.  If you grab a page and move it from the right to the left, you're moving forward thru the book.\nIt's the same with the trackpad.  You can change this in Settings --> Trackpad.  If you use any other Apple product, they all use the same direction for moving between pages.\n\nA: Maybe it will help if you think of the swiping as if you were moving the current page out of the way to get to the page you want. In your example - you are trying to get back to page A from C. Imagine them in a line, oldest to the left, newest to the right. You are pushing the current page, C to the right, by swiping in a left to right movement to get to page B and then A.\nHope that helps! \n", "Q: What does it mean Band or Non-band in an iPhone specs?

In this case we get:\n# file 1610.01410v2\n1610.01410v2: POSIX tar archive (GNU)\n\nSo, you can open it up using tar, from the terminal:\ntar xvf 1610.01410v2\nx defectfcn.eps\nx sepvol2ment.tex\n\nOr, just rename it to 1610.01410v2.tar and let the Finder handle it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to define the width/height of a Terminal window with this command: osascript -e \\'tell application \"Terminal\" to do script I am using this command to do some magic for my personal use:\nosascript -e \\'tell application \"Terminal\" to do script\n\nIs it possible to precisely define the width and height of the popup Terminal window?\nIf not, is there anyway I can do it after it's opened? (Precisely adjust its size value)\n\nA: Open a Terminal window and position it on the screen where you want it and resize it to the size you want.\nThen in Terminal, execute the following command:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\" to get bounds of front window'\n\nIt will return a four-item list of integers, e.g:\n0, 22, 730, 531\n\nNow move the Terminal window to a different position on the screen and resize it.\nThen in Terminal, execute the following command, while substituting the actual list returned from the get bounds command, e.g:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\" to set bounds of front window to {0, 22, 730, 531}'\n\nYou'll see that the window gets repositioned and resized to what it was when you ran the get bounds command.\n", "Q: OSX Sierra - WindowServer process hangs, high CPU, whole OS freezes I just updated my 15 inch macbook pro retina 2014 model from OSX El Capitan to Sierra (10.12.2) and have noticed an ugly problem. It appears when I press and hold the F1-F2 (screen light +/-), the F5-F6 (keyboard light +/-) or the F11-F12 (volume +/-), the whole system becomes unresponsive for an amount of time proportional with how much I hold the button pressed. In the activity monitor I can see when it recovers that the WindowServer jumped to 100%+. This used to work perfectly on El Capitan, with normal behaviour(incremented/decremented the values until limits 0-16 bars on screen). I will file a bug report on Apple forum as well.\nEDIT: I also posted on Sierra forum here. Dont know where else to report this so Apple engineers can see and fix it.\n\nA: I had the very same problem after upgrading to macOS High Sierra 10.13.6. My 2010 MacBook Pro hangs between 2-5 minutes completely. If MacBook returns to normal, Activity Monitor shows exactly the amount of CPU usage for windowserver process as the hang time.\nI changed the keyboard settings to fast (both sliders to the right) and the problem became worse. Then a I did the opposite, (changed both sliders to the left) and the problem was gone.\n\nA: Wow I accidentally debugged this myself.\nIt seems after all that my problem was actually a side effect caused by the real issue which was: macOS Sierra changed how it handled defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0, it no longer supported a zero value, and I had it changed to zero in Yosemite or El Capitan to make the cursor advance faster. To reset it back to normal parameters I changed the keyboard typing delays in the System Preferences > Keyboard back to fastest (both sliders were dragged to the left sidecheck using $ defaults read  NSGlobalDomain in terminal\n, most likely cause I upgraded from El Capitan and something changed in Sierra, and the keyboard was queueing input events as fast as possible, so the WindowServer process hogged the CPU like crazy) and now my initial problem is gone.\nMaybe I should change the title of the question so that others can find this solution..\n", "Q: Trying to drop Mac OS 9 disk image over sheepshaver on Sierra gives me error \"Please drop either a file named 'Mac OS ROM'... \" I'm trying to install sheepshaver to run old mac games on my Macbook running Mac OS Sierra.

You need to copy the application to another directory, e.g. the Applications directory and then copy the ROM file over.\n\nA: Don't know, if it helps, but I also wasn't able to open the SheepShaver.app... until I downloaded the SheepShaverPrefs from here: \nhttp://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=7360\nI set it up, and then everything worked fine.\n", "Q: Is it possible to downgrade my iphone 5 firmware from 10.2 to 7.1.2 by restoring to an old backup?

If one part of a Fusion Drive (i.e. disk0s2) suddenly get a wrong partition type, the \"Fusion Drive\" is split and dysfunctional.\nA bootable OS X partition (except the Recovery HD) either has the GUID 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC for a standard OS X partition or the GUID 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC for a CoreStorage partition. The FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF is an unknown partition type (but not no partition like the 000000-0000-0000.... one).\nSince your iMac contains a Fusion disk and the remnants of CoreStorage items are visible in the diskutil output (disk1s2 and disk2) it's the latter.\nThe GUID can be modified with gpt. You can only add, delete and modify GUID partition tables with gpt when all related disks are unmounted. If you have a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group (e.g a Fusion drive or a FileVault volume) the logical volumes get their own (virtual) disk identifiers which have to be unmounted first. An example is your first diskutil listoutput: your logical volume got the disk identifier disk2. To unmount disk1 you have to unmount disk2 first because parts of it reside on disk1 (disk1s2). The other part resides on the defunct disk0 (disk0s2):\n/dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                            MacintoshHD            +523.0 GB   disk2\n                                 Logical Volume on disk1s2, disk0s2\n                                 B6A398E1-B484-4A1A-A590-2FB663DC609A\n                                 Unencrypted Fusion Drive\n\nTo reconfigure your partitions boot to a third party drive (e.g. Internet Recovery or a OS X installer thumb drive).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery Mode\n\n*Open Terminal in the menubar Utilities > Terminal\n\n*Get an overview with diskutil list\n\n*Get an overview of your internal disks with the disk identifier found in the previous command.

If you get an error \"disk too small\" use a slightly lower size like 997g or 996g. After removing a BootCamp or a Linux partition the hard way this may fail because internals of the CoreStorage Logical Volume Group got corrupted. Then you have to backup your main volume with e.g. Time Machine, clean-recreate your Fusion Drive from scratch and restore your system with your Time Machine backup.\n\nTo remove GRUB you have to remember where you installed it. Usually it's installed to one of the two EFI partitions. You have to mount either of them and check if they contain \"uncommon\" folders.\n", "Q: Mac Fuse doesn't work I have installed macfuse and fuse-ext2 multiple times and yet they don't seem to work.

Is there an app that makes it so that a pin is required to power-off the phone? Or, can someone explain to me how Find my iPhone works if is powered-off and can't be located?\n\nA: There isn't currently a way to set an iPhone (or iPad) to require a passcode to allow powering off, without jail-breaking your device. It seems to be quite a popular feature request that Apple haven't implemented. For example, this 9to5Mac post from earlier this year. https://9to5mac.com/2016/01/28/feature-request-theft-protection/\nUnfortunately if your device is turned off it will not be able to update its location. However as soon as the device is turned back on (assuming it is turned back on) it will resume updating its location.

Or maybe in some way I can persist always deny for reading some passwords from Keychain? Or maybe exists some correct way to disable of using Keychain for Git? This official article from AWS says: 'Install a version of Git that does not use the keychain by default or configure the Keychain Access utility to not provide credentials for AWS CodeCommit repositories.' How to do any of that?\n\nA: Expires is a field that Keychain uses on items which have an intrinsic expiry, such as certificates. You're not able to set passwords with an expiry.\n", "Q: macOS switches to Bluetooth headphones automatically Presumably since the last update to macOS 10.2.2, the system started to switch to my Bluetooth headphones automatically every time they come in Bluetooth range. That means that my Macbook switches audio output every time I come home (I use them on my iPhone as well). Even if I explicitly set the audio output to \"Internal Speakers\" on the Macbook, it will still behave like this. \nThis is very annoying for several reasons, mostly because the Macbook does't seem to be very good at switching BT audio off when no audio is playing, which results in my headphone's battery being empty pretty much every day now.\nDoes anybody else have this problem? Any solutions? \n\nA: You can consider setting your Mac not to auto-connect to Bluetooth headphones, using this command in Terminal:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist DontPageAudioDevices 1\n\nThis will not interfere with Apple Magic Mouse, Keyboard or Trackpad. Only audio devices will not be auto-connected.\n\nA: There's a solution I found on Reddit that work for me:\n\nI turn off bluetooth when I don't need it and changed my workflow so that I don't need to use bluetooth devices on my macbook anymore.\n\n", "Q: Custom shell script can't be found I am running MacOSX Sierra and have homebrew installed.

It has been showing faulty behaviour since the first bootup. \nFirstly, right after the Apple logo on startup, the Mac gets extremely slow, like you'd need a minute or two just to move the cursor to click the user you want to login as.\nSecondly, on my first bootup I created a second user account. So (User1, User2 and Guest). However when booting the Mac it only shows User1 and Guest. User1 his avatar is like a black version of the guest icon, very strange. Once I log into User1, it will show the option to switch to User2.\nI've also had a couple kernel panics. (Sorry didn't save the output). \nI've ran Apple Diagnostics several times and it shows no problems detected.\nAny idea what could be the cause?\n\nA: It's hard to know what slow means. If you have FileVault enabled - only accounts that are cleared to unlock e drive show up after the boot to the pre-start screen. \nOnce one of those users authenticates, the volume gets unlocked and then the OS boots. If you don't expect this layer and seeing the OS boot after user credentials are presented, that might explain everything. Without a stopwatch to time what is slow, it's hard to tell more what you are seeing. \nSince all new hardware gets AppleCare for questions like this, I would get their help narrowing down your variables and perhaps ask a follow on question with some specifics if needed. \n", "Q: OSX suddenly hangs/beachballs all the time - possibly caused by windowserver or aperture? Since a day, my Macbook Pro has (quite suddenly) become very slow. Of course, this is just a couple days before a major deadline :-). Any help would be appreciated! If there any questions I can answer, ask away. \n\n\n*\n\n*It beachballs all the time. This happens in whichever app I’m running at the time, and independently of how many apps are open and which apps are currently open.\n\n*It seems to be especially slow when actions that require drawing things are taken. I.e. showing the dock, typing text, pasting text, opening a right-click menu or a new window. For example, I tried to right click to open a menu just now and it beach balled. I am not entirely sure if this has anything to do with OSX actually having to draw things, or if it’s just that it’s slow because it needs to do something slightly more complex, but I think it has something to do with graphics. \n\n*Sometimes, when a certain app starts to beachball, I can switch to another app and I can use that one fine. Switching back to the beachballing app becomes impossible. Sometimes, even switching to other apps or using expose stops working.\n\n*Sometimes the dock (set on autohide) seems to not want to show, or when I click an app on it, nothing seems to happen. It’s as if it doesn’t register my click. Same goes with launchpad or for example Firefox's back/forward buttons. \n\n\nI can’t really think of any direct cause. I was using it fine yesterday, and since yesterday night it is suddenly b0rked. Two-three days ago, I installed two apps: Boom (including its helper application, BoomDevice) and Aperture (because meh@Apple Photos). I’ve since uninstalled both using CleanMyMac3, and ran a script to remove the helper application. No improvements though (I did restart).\nI’ve had the feeling on previous Mac OS X installs I have that my Mac becomes slow after installing Aperture, even when it’s not running, but it’s never become this slow. \nWhat I’ve already done/checked\n\n\n*\n\n*Checked system monitor to see if there are any processes hoarding memory or CPU. There don’t seem to be any processes with any CPU footprint > 10%. Except for Windowserver, which seems to take between 3% and 15% of CPU, which seems high to me. \n\n*Used bitdefender to run critical and deep system virus scans - no results.\n\n*Removed all Today widgets in the notifications menu\n\n*Tested if it seems tied to running a particular app such as Firefox or Calibre. \n\n*Reset my Firefox profile\n\n*Ran CleanMyMac 3 maintenance scripts\n\n*Uninstalled Aperture, Spotify and Boom using CleanMyMac3’s uninstaller\n\n*Uninstalled the BoomDevice helper application using the Apple Script provided by the developers\n\n*Ran the Disk Utility’s first aid tool on the Macintosh HD partition and the HD (?) itself.

The weird problem is that this happened even after having it repaired within the special Apple program). I'm kinda afraid my current problems might be a precursor to having this happen again. \n\n*I've returned this Macbook twice to reinstall Mac OS X since somehow the Mac OS X installer (in the recovery mode) fails to recognize this computer’s serial number. This is also the reason I’ve not just reinstalled El Capitan right now (or upgraded to the new version), because I’m afraid it’ll turn my Macbook into a brick again… \n\n\nInformation about the computer\n\n\n*\n\n*Model: MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2011)\n\n*OS Version: El Capitan (10.11.6)\n\n*Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB\n\n*Memory: 4GB\n\n*Most used apps: Firefox, Sublime Text, Alternote, iBooks\n\n\nA: According to the EtreCheck post, your harddrive is about to die.

This cable is cheap and I would recommend to replace it while you're at it.\nFor harddisk replacement, I would recommend a SSD instead of a traditional harddisk, it will make your Mac feel like new. While you're at it, upgrading the RAM to 8GB or 16GB will definitely help a lot performance-wise and make your Mac last a few more years.\n", "Q: Why does creating a new account and making it an administrator require system restart?

When creating a new account as an administrator, the message is not shown. The OS doesn't keep track of whether or not the account has been logged in before, so changing the account type of an existing account asks you to restart in order for it to take effect.\n", "Q: Default contact group for new contacts in iOS 10 I use an iOS 10 device together with an Exchange server and several contact folders (some of them shared).

This is my only option. I was wondering if anyone knew how to view a DVD on a mac that has been formatted as a windows DVD? Whenever I insert it, I receive a message claiming that it's an empty disk, but I know it isn't. If anyone could help me that would be fantastic!\n\nA: There's no such thing as a \"Windows formatted\" DVD. DVD and CD-ROMs have their own format which is supported by Windows, Mac, Linux and all sorts of appliances, media players, etc.\nI will recommend testing:\n1) Can the Mac play other DVDs than the problematic one?\n2) Does the problematic DVD play on another PC?\nIf test 1 is negative, try to resolve the problem with the DVD drive on the Mac - for example cleaning the lens, etc. Maybe consider buying an external USB DVD-drive.\nIf test 2 is negative, try cleaning the DVD disc itself and check it for scratches, etc. It might not be possible to fully recover all the data from it.\nIf both tests are positive you might have a DVD that is in the process of being filled up with data - i.e. it is not finalized yet. You would then need to finalize the disc - most easily done using the original software you used for burning data to the disc.\n", "Q: Where does the Photos app store its files?

This will require deserialising.\n\nA: Programatically, you would need to trace the app while it runs:\nsudo fs_usage -w Photos\n\nExcept, that Photos uses some system daemons to update things in the background if you use iCloud backed libraries. What are you actually trying to do - learn how localized folder names work or how localization works in an app that's been internationalized with strings?\n\nA: The folder name is composed of ~/Pictures/${localpart}.photoslibrary/, where ${localpart} stored in a .strings file provided by the Photos app. To extract it, use this command:\nplutil -p /Applications/Photos.app/Contents/Resources/${lan}.lproj/IPXMain.strings |\n  grep \"IPXDefaultLibraryName\" |\n  cut -d\">\" -f2 | xargs\n\nwhere ${lan} is your operation system's language.

I know that using a higher amperage charger will make a device charge faster.  But is there a limit to how high the current can be?  Could too high a current damage the battery?.  Could I use a 24watt (5v/4.1A) USB charger (intended to charge USB-C devices such as my Nexus 5x) to charge an iPhone?.  I'd use a USB-A to USB-C cable for connection.\n\nA: The 6/6S can take advantage of up to 1.6 amps if the USB adapter can supply it. Using a higher capacity adapter will not hurt the phone, but won't help either. An iPad adapter is 2.2 amps, the iPhone \"cube\" is 1 amp. So an iPad adapter will charge an iPhone 6 or 6S series slightly faster. Not true for the 5 and earlier, which will only use 1 amp regardless of what is available. \n\nA: It will not \"hurt\" your iPhone, however with long term use and everyday charging with the larger amperage, you will damage your battery faster and it will start performing worse more quickly than it would normally.\nI recommend charging your iPhone with the standard 1 amp charger that is included with your iPhone. However, if you're in a pinch and need some extra battery fast, then using a larger amp charger won't destroy your iPhone.\nThe iPhone does not need 2.1 amps forced inside it, but it will handle it.\nPeople claim the iPhone is designed to handle more than 1 amp of power, such as the iPad's 2.1 amp brick. Just because there is a cutoff at the amount the iPhone will accept, (not sure what it is just over 2.1 amp I believe) doesn't mean shoving more than 1 amp of power inside it won't damage the internals. The power management chip and battery has to work with more power. (more heat, more wear) Also, using more than 1 amp will increase the temperature of the iPhone overall which is not good for a lot of parts of the phone.(glue, plastic)\nYes, Apple lists that the iPad charger is compatible with your iPhone. It does work, and won't cause noticeable harm for a while. Also, worst case scenario for Apple is you go and drop more money on a battery replacement. More heat and more power is never a good thing, and will cause long term damage and poor battery performance, with the possibility of other things failing faster. I have seen it first hand with my customers before. (I own a small business fixing iPhones) Things such as glue and plastic can loosen up and move. Screens sometimes will get small bubbles under them, screens will sometimes loosen up and require new glue to re secure them into their proper place. The customers that had those issues claimed they regularly charge with an iPad brick.\nSource\n", "Q: All data lost? External Hard drives encrypted with filevault and 'espionage'. Macbook pro internal hard drive damaged I have several external hard drives, most encrypted with FileVault.  Some with a 3rd party software called 'Espionage' (FileVault is better).   \nMy MacBook Pro's internal hard drive suddenly started clicking and I can never start it up now.  Hardware problem.  Always starts clicking when I tried to start my MacBook.\nI replaced it with an SSD. However, the old keychain encryption is lost.   I still have the passwords but they are useless without the keychain encryption password generated by the computer that is stored in the damaged internal HD.\nSo am I in ruins with all my data from my internal HD gone and all my external hard drives?\n\nA: Chances are fairly good that your data is still intact on your old internal drive. It depends on exactly what part failed.\nSend your old drive to a data recovery company. Drivesavers is one, there are others. They will do things like replace the controller card, or remove the platters and put them in a working drive.\nExpect a bill somewhere between US$1000 and $2000.\nFor comparison purposes, an external backup drive costs about $150, and restoring a Time Machine backup takes an hour.\n\nA: Unfortunately, yes your data is lost if you are not able to retrieve the encryption password. You may have some luck if you can find a way to mount your Mac internal HD with the encryption stored on it; you might want to look into your data recovery options for that drive if you want access to your other drives.\nAnother possibility is if your Keychain passwords were stored to iCloud somehow, but it sounds like that was not set up.\n\nA: If it just started clicking, you could be lucky and still copy all data before the disk dies.\n\n\n*\n\n*You may try to put your old harddisk in a Docking Station or external Thunderbold/Firewire/USB case.\n\n*Manually copy your Keychain from ~/Library/Keychains to your new SSD. Reboot your MacBook. Now you should be able to access your previous keychain including 3rd party software keychains.\n\n*If possible, create a complete backup using TimeMachine, CCC, Superduper…\nGood luck.\n\nA: After installing the trial of Espionage and investigating the behavior of the app by checking fs_events my conclusion is:\nEspionage doesn't write at all to ~/Library/Keychains and the passwords are stored in a plist-like database somewhere else.\nEverything (including the different independently computed sparsebundle passwords) is saved to the file ~/Library/Application Support/com.taoeffect.Espionage3/database3. Older database3 files can be found in the folder ~/Library/Application Support/com.taoeffect.Espionage3/backups. \nIf you don't have a backup of your old system drive, the only possibility you have is to recover one of these files with a data recovery tool from the broken drive. You have to put the broken drive in an external case. Then use appropriate tools to recover one of the database3 files. \nIf you don't know how to do it and which tools to use, mandate a data recovery service. If they bill dependent on recovered data amount it should be cheap, because you only need the database3 file with a size of ~200 kb.\n\nA: As @peter said, there is a high percentage of chances that your data is still intact. What I recommend, is that you try to backup everything with a software called Disk Drill (the full version cost 79€) I had the same problem and it worked.\n", "Q: Chrome crashes computer when I insert USB Ethernet adapter It seems that Chrome causes a crash on macOS whenever I insert a USB Ethernet adapter.\nFor a long time I didn't know the reason; I just plugged it in and tried it again and again until my Mac accepted it and let me use it. I thought it was just a problem with macOS.\nBut yesterday, I changed the default browser to Safari, and I was able to successfully use my adapter the whole day. At the end of the day I decided to make Chrome my default browser again, and my Mac crashed.\nToday I experimented more and found that whenever I connect to the Internet via Ethernet, everything is OK until I open Chrome. I tried disabling all my plugins but it didn't help. \nWhat can I do?\n\nA: It's the realtek drivers which cause the hang which the USB ethernet adaptor tries to use and Chrome seems to get mangled into it.  If you're running the latest Sierra you probably don't actually need these installed.  You can either remove them both through /library/extensions RTL815 or run the scripted uninstaller that comes with the package from \nhttp://www.realtek.com.tw/Downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=14&PFid=55&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false\n", "Q: With what info can attacker gain access to my Apple Id? I want to be sure how secure Apple is.\nWhat does third malicious party need to gain access to my Apple account?\nCan it only be done if they know by password or security questions (those are all well guarded)?\nIf malicious side has the email address name I use for my Apple account and as my Apple Id, they know my log in (admin name, only one account in Mac) name, street name, country, postal code and such things, they won't be able to gain access, right? Basically the info I have in my App Shop account information page.\n\nA: Have you enabled two step verification? If not that would be the first thing I do after reading this. This makes it so if someone trys to sign into your account it sends a message to all the devices you have associated with your account, presenting you with the name of the device and the location of the device (based on IP)\nTry to hack your own account, and find out the steps you need to gain access.\nFor me when I try to recover my password (the first step a hacker might take) it asks me to confirm my phone number. If you don't know your phone number you're out of luck. If you do know the phone number then it doesn't matter much anyways as a confirmation message is sent to your phone. \nI also believe they cannot present your security questions without you not being logged in for 24 hours. That could be Google I'm thinking of though.\nAfter that information here are a couple steps I would take if I was worried about security.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable two step verification.\n\n*Be sure you use a different password for your Apple Id than you do on any other account (good practice for everything anyway) Never give out your password, be sure to always confirm where you are on the web. Ex. \"Google.com\" not \"Gooogle.com\" (Even though this example doesn't work because Google owns both domains, you get the point)\n\n*Be sure you have access to the phone number and email address on file with your account.\n\n*Ensure the email you have listed for your Apple ID is secure, and uses it's own password as well so a hacker couldn't gain access to that either.\n\n*I would recommend using Gmail if you don't already use it with your Apple ID, as I find them to be the most secure email to use.\nDon't worry too much, you're in good hands!\n\nA: This is very simple to answer but, as much as I dislike doing so, it must be done with a question:\nWhat does a hacker need to know?  What information did you provide?  That's what they need to know.\n", "Q: Event sync between iPhone calendar and outlook 2016 calendar results in a time zone error I have a IPhone 6S w/ IOs 10.2 and Outlook 2016 (office 365) in my Menovo ideapad 710S 64 bits with Windows 10.\nWhen I add a new event in ICloud calendar, the event apperas one hour later in the  Outlook calendar, and when I add a new event in Outlook calendar it appears one hour earlier in ICloud Cal.\nBoth devices are setted in the same time zone. How can I discover or correct this time zone error?\n\nA: I turned away from iCloud Control Panel for Windows earlier because of some other reason that iCloud folders of contact, calendar and task cannot be used as Outlook default folder. This often gives me a headache that I have to always click into icloud folders before creating new entries. The solution I found working for me is EVO Collaborator for Outlook. Regarding to the time zone issue in the question, I have never met such problem because I think the Outlook add-in self-adjusts to the time zone you are at vs. what is on your iCloud account. You can try it out.\n\nA: The easiest way I fix this is to sign in to the web interface for the calendar in question. From that interface - be sure you have set the main account to enable time zone support and that the time zone is the one you want. Then - you will have a version of what the \"truth\" on the server is. Then you can easily tell which OS is messed up and make adjustments.\nWhile you're at it - set a calendar reminder for the day before the next daylight time switch so you know to revisit this. It's often not clear that things are really correct until you see both clients through the fall back and spring forward changes if any.\n", "Q: How to recover photos that were deleted during an import from an iPhone to Photos? Two weeks ago, we had some friends over and one of them wanted to show us some of her photos, so she used my Mac to import them and do a slideshow on the TV.\nNow she just realized that the photos aren't on her phone anymore, and asked me to send the copies that were on my computer. The problem is that I deleted her photos the next morning, thinking she had them on her phone.\nApparently the Photos app has a tickbox that removes the photos from the phone after the import but nobody payed attention to that setting.\nSo my question is: is there a chance to recover the photos using a data recovery software? Is there a folder in particular that I should scan?\n\nA: When images are \"deleted\" in Photos, they are actually moved to a special album called \"Recently Deleted\", where they wait for 30 days before they are actually removed from your computer. Assuming you didn't manually clean out this folder after deleting them, you should be able to recover them by navigating to Recently Deleted, selecting the photos, and clicking Recover in the top-right corner.\nHere is about where Recently Deleted should appear in the sidebar (it may appear differently depending on what other albums you have):\n\n\nA: I would first check to see if your friend can log in to the Photos web app for their iCloud account on a modern computer browser. This would let them check quickly for deleted photos album and/or iCloud photo stream for the images in question. There's a 30 day period for deletion there - so get that going quickly.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.icloud.com/#photos2\nNext - consider powering off your computer if you are going to try to scan for deleted images. Start with https://www.prosofteng.com/picturerescue-photo-recovery-software/ - the demo is free and they offer great guidance on how to run their product.\n\nA: enter link description hereIt would not seem that her iPphone/photos are connected to iCloud (specifically, iCloud Photo Library) If they were, Photos would not have let you imported them through traditional plug-in manner. This is due to the fact that the photos are not being really stored on her phone (besides possibly low-res versions) That being said, it does sound like the tick box for \"delete items after import\" somehow was selected.\nMy question(s) for you is: Did you not only delete the photos, but also go to the recently deleted folder and dump that as well? The PHOTOS app has a Recently Deleted section in the sidebar where recent deleted photos are stored temporarily for 30 days before they are automatically erased. If you have NOT done so, then the Photos will be in there and they can be recovered by selecting them and clicking the recover button Photos provides.\nOption #2 : Does the Mac you are using have a Time Machine backup? If so, you would have an out where you can roll back the system or just the photos one day back before the decision to delete them and they can be recovered that way. I understand the time frame was pretty short of having those particular photos on your computer. You would need a backup that was completed in between putting those pictures on and deleting them. My desktop iMac is always connected to a drive, so it is making hourly backups. If it was a laptop Mac, I understand that chance would be much less likely to have made a backup during that time.\n"]
