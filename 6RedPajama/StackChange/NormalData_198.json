["Q: Unpinned Docky/Plank icon from Docky/Plank docks and can't pin it on again The Docky/Plank icons on the homonym docks let the user edit the settings more quickly than modifying the configuration file, I unpinned them and now I don't know how to pin them on again.\n\nA: In version 0.11.1 the solutions listed here no longer work because Plank has migrated to GSettings for storing its settings - at a long last. I've been nagging Rico to do that since forever.\nTo enable/disable the plank icon in 0.11.1 and later, open dconf-editor (if it's not installed, run sudo apt-get install dconf-editor) and navigate to net.launchpad.plank.docks.dock1. You will see a list of settings for the dock in there, including a show-dock-item checkbox. Check it to show the plank item in dock.\n\nA: This is what I had to do,\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to /home/shashwat/.config/plank/dock1 \n\n*Open the file settings \n\n*Find these lines,\n#Whether to show the item for the dock itself.\nShowDockItem=false\n\n*Change ShowDockItem to true and save file.\n\n\nA: Simply \"Ctrl + Right Click\" on the plank, it will open a context menu, there you can choose \"Preferences\". :)\nOR\nSimply type this in the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T),\nplank --preferences\n\nBoth will do the trick, if you didn't find settings in /home/USERNAME/.config/plank/dock1\n\nA: This is what I had to do,\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to ~/.config/plank/dock1\n\n*Open the file settings\n\n*Find these line: ShowDockItem=false\n\n*Change ShowDockItem to true and save file.\n\n\nworks thanks.\n\nA: \nIn version 0.11.1 the solutions listed here no longer work because\n  Plank has migrated to GSettings for storing its settings - at a long\n  last.

So, to boot into Ubuntu, I have to Restart the machine by first booting into Windows and then using Shift+Restart (advanced option etc.)\nSo, my question is: how to decide what to enable and/or disable before installing Ubuntu along Windows 8.1.\n\nA: Once upon a time, in the not so far past, Ubuntu did not support UEFI BOOT but nowadays, Ubuntu supports UEFI BOOT!\nHowever you need to use the UEFI menu to boot the CD, not the BIOS menu...  \nNote: As I have seen UEFI systems that did not support UEFI DEV boot, you had to go into the BIOS to BOOT from DEV, but that turns UEFI off!\nSo if you went into the BIOS of the HP to boot from DVD, what happened was:\n\n\n*\n\n*UEFI turned off\n\n*Ubuntu installed in non-UEFI mode\n\n*reboot into UEFI\n\n*Ubuntu doesn't work until you turn off UEFI in the BIOS again. (But to boot Windows 8.1 you need to turn it back on!)\n\n\nTo avoid this for now and in the future, re-install using the UEFI menu to boot the CD, and as I all the HPs I've ever seen all supported UEFI DVD boot, you might have an old UEFI firmware on your HP (Just an informed guess), so upgrade your UEFI firmware before reinstalling.  \nBefore upgrading your UEFI firmware, gave a good look through all the UEFI screens as the DVD boot might be hidden away in \"advanced settings\"..\n", "Q: How do I make Ubuntu a NetBIOS WINS server? We are creating a Windows CE based, mobile 6 solution. The solution pulls and uploads files to folders from the mobile device, to the server (which is Ubuntu).

For test we are trying to ping the server by name and is failing. We have tried almost everything but still not able to get the WINS going on the server.\nWe have followed this answer Why can't my machine resolve local windows hostnames? and installed libnss-winbind.\n\nA: Have you added \n[global]\nwins support = yes  \nname resolve order = wins lmhosts hosts bcast\n\nTo your smb.conf?\nYou may not need anything but \nname resolve order = wins\n\nBut the rest is explained in link below \nFor more info see This section\nIf you still can't get wins to work, you should be able to define the shares in \nusr/local/samba/lib/LMHOSTS\n\nAn example LMHOSTS file\n192.168.220.100 hydra\n192.168.220.100 simple\n192.168.220.101 phoenix\n\nIts just like the /etc/host file, but instead of using hostname, your defining netbios shares\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu, partitioning small SSD and HDD I looked at several related questions because some questions remained for me.\nI have just bought a Asus Ultrabook with Windows 8 pre-installed, 500gb HDD and 24gb SSD. Apparently (according to some other answers to related questions) Windows is installed in the 24gb SSD because it boots very fast. I intend to follow this tutorial http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html but I have few questions about the outcome and process.\nFirst, Can I install only Ubuntu in the SSD (considering I'm novice and didn't find any specific tutorial) and keep windows in the HDD, does worth doing that ? I intend to use MatLab, Python (I'm still novice at Python too, so nothing demanding), Mathematica and others, in Windows I need to use AutoCad 2d and some other similar programs. If I do install Ubuntu in SSD, would it be \"painful\" to access bios as it is with Windows ? (I can't access directly pressing F2, I need to follow some steps and then restart twice the computer.) \nThen, assuming everything above is ok, does that tutorial works for my case ? He shrinks partitions on Windows, could it result in a problem since \"Windows is installed in the SSD\"? \nObs: I'm assuming that SSD couldn't have Windows and Ubuntu since it is too small.\n\nA: Don't do it! Leave the SSD alone and install on the HDD.  Then use bcache to use the 24GB HDD as a cache for the HDD just like Windows uses SRT!\n\nFollow this advice: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI instead.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu on the small SSD. I did that, but that small SSD isn't very reliable. It is already going bad for me, it has many bad sectors. I wouldn't recommend it honestly.\n", "Q: How do I install “Slender” through Wine or PlayOnLinux?

Just enter something relevant to the game, without spaces!\n  \n*Now you must locate the executable, usually this is a file named \"setup.exe\". But it could also be named \"install.msi\" or something similar. If you've downloaded the installer you should probably know where it is. When you've located the executable, press \"Forward\". Now there will soon pop-up a install window as it would have done on Windows. Just follow the applications installation instructions from there.\n  \n*When the installer is done, press \"Forward\" and \"Yes\". Now you must locate the application. It is usually something like: Program Files/NameOfTheGame/Game.exe Press forward, enter the games name, and choose if you want any shortcuts. (The installer might already have placed on on your desktop!) If anything else pop-ups, press \"No\".\nCongratulations, you are done!\nRunning your application\nMost of the time you'll have a shortcut on your desktop or in your main menu.

UEFI is enabled. LiveCD works as it should. Installation is complete. After restart laptop boots immediately to PC. Boot-repair returns this http://paste.ubuntu.com/10147575/ . I am nostalgic of the times before EFI. Ah the times we had, when a linux installation would take less than 45 minutes. Anyway, if anyone could offer any advice, I would owe them a great debt (not to mention my sanity)\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot  Live CD / Live USB, select try Ubuntu\n\n*Once it's loaded, open terminal CtrlAltT\n\n*Do the following\n\n\nsudo mount  /dev/sda8   /mnt\nsudo mount --bind /dev   /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc   /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys  /mnt/sys\nsudo chroot /mnt\nNOTE: the /dev/sda8 is your Ubuntu partition, from what I see in your pastebin file.

Basically what we're doing here is installing grub on the boot sector of the hard drive, not just one partition /dev/sda8. \n\nA: When you boot up hold the SHIFT key. If Ubuntu installed correctly,  GRUB should load and give you options for which OS you want to start.

I guess I need to add numpy and etc. to this version. How do I do it, please? Thank you!\n\nA: Your IPython and IDLE editions are based on different major versions of Python (2 and 3 respectively). For your projects you need to use either one or the other for consistency. The relevant package names for the two Python versions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Python 2: idle ipython python-numpy python-scipy\n\n*Python 3: idle3 ipython3 python3-numpy python3-scipy\nYou can install all of them side by side, but you'll get into trouble if you try to run the same piece of software on both except for the most simple cases.\n", "Q: Linux is making much more hard disk noise than Windows 7 on laptop I have 2 partitions on my Compaq laptop. Windows 7 is installed to one and Ubuntu 12.04 is installed to other using a usb stick installer.\nWhat I noticed is whatever I do (opening a tab in browser, running a new program) is much slower and makes too much hard disk noise on Ubuntu. Also the boot time is longer on Ubuntu.\nMy Windows partition is ntfs and it is 100 GB.\nUbuntu partition is ext4 and 8 GB.\nI have AMD Turion 64 cpu, 2.5 GB RAM and NVidia 6100 graphics card.\nAny ideas?\nEDIT: Adding the output of df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda6       8.1G  5.7G  2.0G  75% /\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev            1.2G  4.0K  1.2G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           245M  1.4M  243M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            1.2G   13M  1.2G   2% /run/shm\nnone            100M   16K  100M   1% /run/user\n\n\nA: First of all: this is a hardware issue.  On the inside of the hard disk, bits are packed more densely then on the outside of the hard disk, so the noise is different.  (And just by your description, without hearing the noise I can deduce that Ubuntu is on the outside of the disk)\nSecondly, it's a really really small partition, so it gets the worst of the worst.\nThirdly, you've only got 2,5 GB or RAM.  Depending what you do on Ubuntu and which flavour you've installed and how you optimised your system, it might be swapping (adding to the noise)\nConclusion: If you only have that little space available for Ubuntu, why not buy a 16GB SLC USB stick (not the MLC ones that you can find anywhere! Order an SLC!) install Ubuntu on there, set your vm.swappiness to 10, your vm.max-readahead to 2048, and your vm.min-readahead to 1024 and you'll have a much better Ubuntu experience without any noise... ;-)\n\nA: I agree with the answer by Fabby in part. The slowness will really be an issue if you put something at the end part of a disc, especially if you put your data far from the swap partition (this last one doesn't seem to be your case). However, it will never make it louder. The noise have nothing to do with reads or writes, have to do with seek operations and with the spin of the disc.\nSeveral hardware parts have noise management these days. HDs are no exception; if you run sudo hdparm -M <device> you can see if your hd have suport to manage noise and the settings you can change to make it faster or quieter. \nPlease, note that hdparm is a low level system tool, and if you can brick you hd playing with it. The command i show here is safe, but there are several things you can do here to destroy your data and your hardware, so please be carefull and as always, read the docs first.\n", "Q: Airplay from Ubuntu 14.10 to Speakers I would like to stream music from my Ubuntu 14.10 machine to Airplay speakers.

If you've never upgraded a kernel before, it's very simple.  3 files(amd64 generic header & image & all.deb), one command(dpkg -i headers.deb image.deb), reboot, and you're done.\n", "Q: ATI Proprietary Drivers Dual Head Setup Failure I have an odd problem, which I think I at least have well described. First, I'll describe what I want to do:\nI want to run two monitors on my desktop PC, I want to drag windows between the monitors, just as I would in a windows PC setup using the \"extended display\" option.\nThe issue began with an observation: that with two graphics cards running two displays independently (using the open source ATI drivers) I observe a flickering/disappearing mouse pointer and very sluggish system performance. Unplugging a monitor removes the issue. Hoping that I could solve the performance issue by using proprietary drivers, I switched to them.\nNow, when I install the proprietary drives using the \"additional drivers\" option, I find that the system has completely disabled one of my cards (as observed via the amdcccle GUI). When I enable, through amdcccle, and reboot, I find that my xorg.conf is overwritten during boot up, again, one card is disabled. When I fix this issue (via commenting out the \"start\" lines in my /etc/init.d/gpu-manager.conf) I find that the changes I make via amdcccle are now persistent between reboots.\nHowever, when I enable the card and successfully detect the monitor, I find that on reboot, I see my desktop on one monitor, and on the other monitor, I see a flat black display, which shows a small \"X\" instead of a mouse pointer, when I mouse over to the monitor.\nEnabling Xinerama complicates the issue - both of my monitors now show my desktop background, and I can log in via either, however, unity never starts. The only way I can get back into a bootable desktop environment is restoring the xorg.conf file.\nI'm quite confused, and have never encountered this issue when running two monitors off of one card. Because of my available cables, and because I have two cards, I'd like to run a display off of each card independently.\nHere is the output from lspci | grep -i VGA:\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Should the power type be different to allow for complete control of nodes?\n\nA: According to the etherwake man page: \"etherwake is a program that generates and transmits a Wake-On-LAN (WOL) \"Magic Packet\", used for restarting machines that have been soft-powered-down (ACPI D3-warm state). \nMAAS supports the wake-on-Lan power type. You can add a node in MAAS and choose 'Wake-on-Lan' from the power type drop down menu, and that will give you the same power on capability. \nWake-on-lan only powers on nodes, it does not power off nodes (this the reason for the error). It's a limitation on this power control. Using other power types, such as IPMI, Virsh, etc., will allow you to power on and off nodes. \n", "Q: unable to login user ubuntu user account after activating the automount partition I had a great problem with auto mounting partition.

Now I am using the guest account.\nIs there any way to system restore or like something else.  \n\nA: Yes there is a system restore and it's called a system back-up but if you didn't make one before you started, you obviously don't have one...\nSo the easiest to do for you now, is to boot from a LiveCD (the CD you installed it with) and choose \"try Ubuntu\".  Then make a full file back-up, (get your file data off the machine onto another medium) and re-install...\nAfterwards, to auto-mount your drives, have a look here: How to automount NTFS partitions? instead (it works for any file system)\nThere is also the hard way of repairing this and that is to look for any changes in the fstab and figuring out what changed.  As you have no point of reference (do you have a back-up of fstab?) this is going to be difficult for you, so I would advise against it.\nNote: look at Ask Ubuntu first; you're not the first one that bricks his system from reading from this guy's blog.

Your performance is going to be much better in that case.\nThe only other way is to buy a new one. (Sorry to be the harbinger of bad news)\n\nA: Your Ubuntu is using Nvidia driver for the card, but that doesn't mean Ubuntu is using Nvidia card.

Is there something where I can click a shortcut key, drag out an area, and it will tell me the height and width of that area?\nSomething similar to Page Ruler for Google Chrome.\nCurrently, I am using Shift + PrtScn and dragging out the area, save the image, and then go into Properties to find out its height and width.\n\nA: How it works\nThe script below measures the size of an area, between two locations of the mouse pointer.\nIt works as followes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place the mouse pointer in the first position (without clicking)\n\n\n*Press the key combination of your choice (see further below)\n\n*Place the mouse in the second position (again without clicking)\n\n\n*Press your key combination again. A notification will tell you the exact size (px) of the area.\n\nOptions\nYou can choose (by uncommenting one of the lines) how you'd like to be notified; either by a notification:\n\nOr a Zenity info window:\n\n(The examples are from different areas)\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, uncomment either one of the lines:\ncommand = ['notify-send', 'Area size', str(w)+' x '+str(h)]\n\n(to be notified by the notify-send option)\nor:\ncommand = ['zenity', '--info', '--title', 'Area Size', '--text', str(w) + ' x ' + str(h)]\n\nfor the Zenity option.\n\n*Save the script in ~/bin (you will probably have to create the directory) as measure_area (no extension) and make it executable.\n\n*Add a key combination of your choice to run the script: Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\nmeasure_area\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*You will have to log out / in first\n\n*It does not make a difference what you take as first/second position; the script measures absolute values.\n\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport math\n\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\narea = home+\"/\"+\".measure_area.txt\"\n\ndef get_pos():\n    pos_data = subprocess.check_output([\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    return [m[2:] for m in pos_data.split()[:2]]\n\ndef confirm():\n    get = subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\", \"--verbose\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    for s in [get[i-1] for i in range(len(get)) if get[i] == \"connected\"]:\n        br_data = float(get[get.index(\"Brightness:\")+1])\n        brightness = lambda br: [\"xrandr\", \"--output\", s, \"--brightness\", br]\n        flash = [\"sleep\", \"0.1\"]\n        for cmd in [brightness(str(br_data-0.1)), flash, brightness(str(br_data))]:\n            subprocess.call(cmd)\n\nif not os.path.exists(area):\n    with open(area, \"wt\") as measure:\n        measure.write(str(get_pos()))\n    confirm()\nelse:\n    second = get_pos()\n    with open(area) as first_m:\n        try:\n            first = eval(first_m.read())\n            w = int(math.fabs(int(second[0]) - int(first[0])))\n            h = int(math.fabs(int(second[1]) - int(first[1])))\n            #--- uncomment either one of the lines below:\n            # command = ['notify-send', 'Area size', str(w)+' x '+str(h)]\n            command = ['zenity', '--info', '--title', 'Area Size', '--text', str(w) + ' x ' + str(h)]\n            #---\n            confirm()\n        except SyntaxError:\n            text = \"Please try again, there was an error in the data\"\n            command = ['zenity', '--info', '--title', 'Please try again', '--text', text]\n        subprocess.Popen(command)\n    os.remove(area)\n\nExplanation\nWhen the script is called the first time, it gets the current mouse position with the xdotool command:\nxdotool getmouselocation\n\nIt then saves the position into an (invisible) file .measure_area.txt, waiting for the second call. \nOn the second call, it reads the file, removes it and compares the stored x/y coordinates to the latest ones, and calculates the size of the area between them.\nEdit\nUpdated the script with a number of improvements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Optimized subprocess.Popen()/subprocess.check_output() commands (thanks to @muru, @Trengot)\n\n*Added a repair procedure in case something went wrong with the first-data file (e.g. if user first tried to run the script without having xdotool installed)\n\n*Added a small confirming screen dim-flash when the key combination is pressed for the first coordinates. It seems a bit more user-friendly to give the user some kind of confirmation of the action.\n\n\nA: Using slop\nAnother simple way of determining the area of a selection is by using slop (Select Operation), a command-line utility \"that queries for a selection from the user and prints the region to stdout.\"\nslop is a comparitively new tool and has not been packaged for Debian/Ubuntu, yet. As it stands you will have to compile it from source:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libxext-dev\ngit clone https://github.com/naelstrof/slop.git\ncd slop\ncmake ./\nmake && sudo make install\n\nThe installation is the most difficult part. slop itself is actually very easy to work with. For instance, the following one-liner will prompt you to select a screen area and will both display the result as a notification and write it to the clipboard:\neval $(slop -t 0 -b 1) && notify-send  \"Selection info\" \"Area: ${W} x ${Y}px \\n Position: X = ${X}px, Y = ${Y}px\" && echo ${W}x${H} | xsel -bi\n\nScreenshot:\n\nA quick breakdown of the commands used:\n\n\n*\n\n*slop -t 0 -b 1 - prompt the user to select a screen area; do not select full windows (-t 0), set selection border to 1px (-b 1)\n\n*eval $(...) - read output of slop into variables\n\n*notify-send ... - send GUI notification with information on selected area\n\n*echo ${W}x${H} | xsel -bi - copy dimensions to clipboard (requires xsel → sudo apt-get install xsel)\n\n\nA: Using shutter\nFirst install Shutter if you don't have it installed.\nsudo apt-get install shutter\n\nOpen up preferences under Edit -> Preferences and select the behaviour tab.\nCheck 'Start shutter at login' and 'Hide window on first launch'.\nSee screenshot below:\n\nUsage\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the shutter panel icon is visible and select your window or whatever you want to measure.\n\n*Click on the shutter icon and select 'selection'.\n\n\n\n\n*Select your starting point and drag to your end point. The whole window will darken except your selection. You can move the borders around to get more 'to the point' results.\n\n*Shutter will provide a dialog window with the X and Y coordinates and the size (which is what you want) of the selection. See screenshot below in the top-left corner of an example.\n\n\n\n\n*A zoomed out screenshot showing it to be 727px by 367px:\n\n\n\n\n*Finally just press Esc to dismiss the selection and hide shutter.\n\n*Continue with whatever you were doing.\n\n", "Q: Boot repair doesn't help to repair my grub after ubuntu install on dual boot I have problem with my dual boot, and i try boot repair which seems not work :/\nI use windows 7 and Ubuntu on the same SSD, nammed /sda\nYou can find here the boot log url : \nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/10133221/\nUPDATE 1 : \nHum, i fix boot using the windows command prompt and the command you given me, with success.\nI try to boot windows, without success.

Did you select to install it on /dev/sda1? Grub was supposed to prevent this, but if you force it manually it can happen (or maybe it's a new bug).\nAnyway the only way to repair it is to run bootrec /fixboot from a Windows repair prompt which you can get to using a Windows installation DVD or a Windows repair CD.\nDoes Ubuntu boot fine? If so the above should be all you need. Otherwise you need to edit your question and describe in more detail what is happening.\nPS Don't run bootrec /fixmbr as this will splat Grub and don't let Windows automatically repair as the same is likely to happen.\nPPS You can also repair the boot sector most of the time directly from your Ubuntu install which is easier than booting a Windows repair CD: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootSectorFix\n", "Q: Can I specify how often a non-delivery report will get sent for a mail on the mail queue, Exim4 I am using Exim4 as my primary mail transfer agent.\nI have sent a message and it currently resides on exims mail queue and will continue to be there for at least 5 days.\nI believe a Non-Delivery report will be sent to me once every 24 hours telling me that my mail has not been sent.\nCan I ask exim to send a Non-Delivery Report to me once every 6 hours instead of once every 24 hours?\nSo in a 24 hour period I would like to receive 4 non-delivery reports from my exim server telling me my mail is undelivered.\nIs it possible to do this? Any links or information surrounding this topic would be appreciated. \n\nA: I was looking for the delay_warning setting. When a message is delayed, Exim sends a warning message to the sender at intervals specified by this option.\nThis needs to be added to exim's configure file: \ndelay_warning = 4h:8h:24h\n\nThe first message is sent after 4 hours, the second after 8 hours, and the third one after 24 hours. After that, messages are sent every 16 hours, because that is the interval between the last two times on the list. If you set just one time, it specifies the repeat interval.\nSee the exim documentation for more details.\n", "Q: How do I sync contacts with my online account? I've just got my new Ubuntu Touch, how do I import my contacts if I have them saved in my Google account?\n\nA: The first time you open the Contacts app you’ll be asked if you want to sync contacts with your Google account. If you have answered “no” but change your mind later, you can do so by going to the Today scope, and setting up your Google account there. After that you can sync your contacts (and, if you want, calendar events as well).\n", "Q: Unable to update Ubuntu 12.04: Connection refused I am unable to update my current version of Ubuntu.

I want to install MS Visual Studio 2015 (Community Edition) on Ubuntu 14.10 machine I have tried wine but it didn't worked as expected.\n\nA: \nI have tried wine but it didn't worked as expected\n\nYeah, VS will require a full and proper Windows stack. Wine simply won't cut it.\nYou'll need to either dual-boot or use virtualisation (Virtualbox, VMWare, etc) to install a proper copy of Windows. I'd probably go with a virtual machine but it'll likely be somewhat slower than a native install - which may be an issue if you're compiling lots. The up-side is you'll never have to leave Ubuntu.\nOther than that, you probably want to look at transitioning your projects away from .NET and into Mono. It'll be a while until the recent open source .NET stuff hits a usable state, and even then, it'll probably only be a target. I doubt MS will port VS to be cross platform.\n", "Q: Mounting Drives, Replacing with an Array So I currently have a boot drive, and a 500gb Drive, and a 2TB Drive.

I have a username and password for access window share , but i don't know how to use it here . is there any way i can pass username and password . \nTo be honest this is my first time working with Samba , and the windows share is created by Network administrator . I have spent nearly 8 hours for this simple copy . but could not do .\nPlease help me . thanks in advance .  \n\nA: So, your Linux server has a windows share mounted on a local directory, but apparently you cannot write to it. I suppose that this share has been setup as guest access, hence the read only status. Please refer to the ubuntu documentation on mounting windows share as a starting point to fix this configuration issue.\nAs a work around for the time being, I suggest using the smbclient from the command line or a shell script to perform your backups. This command can help you find out the path of the windows share if necessary:\n$ smbclient -L <hostname>\n\nbut as I suggested in the comments, it might be simpler to just look it up from a FS browser (Gnome, KDE, or even a windows shell). This program acts more or less like a ftp client on top of the SMB/CIFS protocols, but it requires precise parameters, so you will have to investigate.\nFor instance, if your windows server belongs to an active directory domain, you will have to pass the -k parameter to smbclient to let it know. You will also have to pass username and password along on the command line. There are many other parameters discussed on the man page, which could be important depending on your situation (eg. Do you need to encrypt the connection?).\nIn interactive mode, as mentioned earlier, this program works like a ftp client, so if you are familiar with ftp commands, you should feel at home with this tool. It is also possible to pass a sequence of ftp instructions on the command line, which is probably what you'll want to use to automate the backups until the share mount is fixed.\nFinally, I also mentioned the system php function which comes handy when needing to invoke a shell command from a php script. Again, all this should be used a temporary solution until the share is fixed: you will have to write your credentials somewhere in the scripts or in a file configuration file accessible from smbclient, which is a bad practice. If possible, you should try to make manual backups, where your credentials would be provided interactively.\n", "Q: ClamAV PUA.Win32.Packer.PrivateExeProte-7 I ran ClamAV on my system and it reported two detections.\nIt reported PUA.Win32.Packer.PrivateExeProte-7 in:\n/usr/lib/mono/4.0/mscorlib.dll\n/urs/lib/mono/4.5/mscorlib.dll\n\nIt says Action taken: None, and I basically have the option to quarantine those files. Is this a virus, trojan or some other malware? I see that my installation of Ubuntu 14.04 has Mono installed (I would assume it was installed by default when I installed the system because I don't remember installing it myself). If this really is malware and I quarantine and remove these files would I break anything?\nI also have Windows 7 installed along my Ubuntu 14.04 system and I use ClamAV to protect that system from possibly getting infected and because I wouldn't want to spread possible malware to someone else who uses a Windows OS. I don't have Wine installed.\nI tried looking online on various forums but I find conflicting reports and opinions on what this is so that's why I'm asking this question here.\n\nA: The PUA mean \"Potentially Unwanted Application\", so it's a fairly low priority alert anyway.\nThe rest of the definition suggests it has found a Windows binary format that is compressed in such a way that makes introspection difficult for antivirus applications. That makes it invaluable for malware authors because they can keep changing the signature on their malware to evade detection.\nIn this case, I think it's just symptomatic of how Mono is built and ClamAV being over-suspicious. I ran a copy of my mscorelib.dlls through VirusTotal and it came back clean. I suggest you do the same.\n\n\nIf this really is malware and I quarantine and remove these files would I break anything?\n\nIt'd break Mono but if it is infected, that wouldn't be awful. You'd just want to reinstall the Mono packages.\n\nA: PUA.Win32.Packer and all of it's variants (and there are bunches) are all suspect in my view.  I just finished doing a full scan of my windows 8.1 drive in Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon 64 bit OS using ClamTK (ClamAV GUI) and found almost 1000 instances of this in almost very filetype.  I understand most feel this PUA is actually a false positive, which I can understand.  But, when you find this \"false positive\" in just about every filetype you can imagine, you really need to be more the suspicious I'd say.  I can understand it possibly being in things like .dll, .exe and a few more, but why is it in a .pdf, or .mp4, and so many other filetypes of personally created files? \nThe reason I scanned this drive is because portions of windows has been self-corrupting and even though I fix them using windows refresh, they self-corrupt a short while later.  I am a computer tech of over 25 years now and have run into just about everything you can imagine over the years.  At the beginning of last year, my home system became infected though someone here downloading spoof emails and \"believing\" some pop-ups were legit and allowing them to run on networked computers.  This was the start to what turned into an on-going battle, which is still not resolved.  \nIt has come down to this.  There are so many infected computers/servers and so much software that is open to security breaching, that just about every computer is compromised to some degree.  Depending of the severity of the malware, unless some very bad or erratic indicators are exhibited, most everyone thinks their AV software is working and their computer is fine.  Well, hate to say it, but they are not fine, not in any sense of the word.  One of the very first things that happen with just about any good malware is compromising computer defenses and antivirus tools.  Any software can be compromised, it just depends at what security level the malware is working under.  Windows, because of it's open structure, is just about indefensible once administration level security has been reached.  There isn't any \"protected file structure\" and cannot be breached and taken over -- I do it all the time when I need to forcefully remove self-protected infected files.  \nNot saying all of this to scare you, but to inform you that you are most likely using an infected computer -- I know I am.  So, the best thing I can say is, do not do online banking, ever.  Do not presume what you type is private in any way.  Make sure you only use credit cards that are fully protected against ANY fraud, online or otherwise.  BTW, less then 5 months back, my credit card was compromised in about a 2 week period to over $8,000.  Got it all back, but don't know how much loss the credit card companies are going to take before they quite doing these payouts.\nSo, just because most people think these PUA's are not really there (which is simply silly, they are for certain there, even if not being used maliciously) or don't want to believe they are \"really\" harmful, don't be too quick to believe them.  Be smart and as try to be as safe as you are able.  You are being watched -- Without doubt, by someone.\n-Rodger\n", "Q: Samba keeps warning 'Session closed for user nobody'. Why? I've set up an Ubuntu 14.04 server, using Samba to share files to our Windows clients.\nEverything appears to be working correctly, but while checking my auth logs, I see the line 'session closed for user nobody' repeated many many times, though no sessions opened for that user. All of the session opened messages have the correct user name included.\nI understand the role of the nobody user, but am unsure why Samba keeps generating this message. On one line the 'session closed' message is repeated 58 times with no other auth log messages interrupting.\nIs it likely that Samba is incorrectly configured?\nI'm happy to post any logs/confs/outputs necessary, if that helps.\nEDIT:\nI've previously disabled Samba password sync using pam-auth-update to stop the 'No Talloc Stackframe' message, like so, could that be generating all of these session closed messages?\n\nA: I had this concern myself so I did some digging and ran into a lot of unanswered forum questions, but then I found this answer:\n\nnobody is a system user that is used to run services e.g. apache and samba  on Linux distros. Root has to start the service and then pass on control to the user nobody.\n\n\nA: The same issue happened to me, at that time I failed to access the shared folder from Windows (by adding the location and access it without configuring the credential on Windows first) and commenting the following line in /etc/samba/smb.conf worked for me.\nmap to guest = bad user\n\n\"pam_unix(samba:session): session closed for user nobody\" appeared right after trying to access the share folder from Windows or other clients.

That's why you're getting so many 404s and so many packages can't be found.\n\n*You've added the Debian Squeeze main repo. While Ubuntu is based on Debian, they aren't directly compatible. Adding an incompatible repository is like injecting the wrong blood type. This is probably the cause of your dependency-related meltdown.\nAt this point, I'm not sure what's best, you could remove the Debian repo but you'd also need to track down anything you've installed from it (as it'll be conflicting with current Ubuntu's packages). You'll also need to switch from the other 404-repos to the old-releases server. Even after all that, you'll still need to upgrade to 13.04, then 13.10 and then 14.04 before you're back on a supported system with live repos.\nSo again, I don't think it's economical to rescue. I would struggle to rescue a system like this if I was on site. Instead I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a 14.04 live USB on another computer\n\n*Reboot into that on this computer\n\n*Rescue my documents, etc to an external drive\n\n*Do a fresh install of 14.04\n\n*Read when Apt asks me if I want to continue in the future.\n\n\nThat'll take you about 40 minutes.

(or use the remote)\nIf Monitor 2 is a real computer monitor, the easiest (and safe) way is to add a piece of hardware called a KVM switch.

One solution I thought might work is to get multiple workspaces to appear at once, and give each half of the resolution.  I do not know how to do this however, so I am hoping someone here does, or hoping someone knows how to do this properly.\n\nA: What you're trying to do is impossible. \nA \"DisplayPort Splitter\" doesn't add any functionality to the existing \"DisplayPort\": it just does what it's designed to do: transmit electrical signals from one wire to two wires.  (note: electric, not electronic) So you cannot get multiple workspaces to display on one monitor and have half on one and the other half on the other.  \nYou could create a large virtual screen (contrarily to a workspace) with a resolution twice as wide as your current display and pan around this virtual screen, but the second monitor would still be displaying exactly what the first monitor is displaying: that is half a screen and an exact copy at that.\nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news.\n", "Q: MySQL not starting in Xampp I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and Xampp 5.6.3-0.

Now I want to engulf the other partition on sda1 ext 4 and preserve all my data and instance on sda6 ext4.

Any suggestions?\nUpdate:\nI have tried resizing sda1 ext4 from about 50GB to 25GB (the minimum amount), and now I have 22GB of unallocated space. I am unable to resize sda6 ext4 in Gparted. Any idea how to use that unallocated space for expanding sda6 ext4?\n\nA: There isn't a merge; and anyway, you have sda5 (swap) in between these two. You would have to copy your data from sda6 to sda1, remove sda2-6, expand sda1 & add a new swap partition. Assuming you have space on sda1, otherwise you may need a second (USB?) drive.\nThat said, it is generally recommended to have at least a 3rd partition for /home as well, so you should end up with /sda1 (system folders), sda2 (user data - /home), & sda3 (swap) with sda2 being the larger.\nA backup is obviously a good idea first!\nYou haven't said how much free space exists, nor if sda5/6 are logical partitions; assuming you have enough room, and that sda1 is not full, and 5/6 are logical (not physical) partitions. This wants doing as a live CD ideally, or you'll need a reboot halfway when your home folder moves:\nRun sudo gparted & shrink sda1 to 20G; remove sda5 (swap) & make a new one, the full space between sda2 & sda6; you may be stuck with sda2 if it's in logical partitions. Format this new sda3 to ext4;  quit gparted at this point, mount sda3 & sda6, and copy the contents of sda6 to the new sda3 like this:\nshopt -s dotglob; cp sda6/* sda3  - replacing the drives with where they are mounted. This ensures all the hidden files get included.\nThen, back to gparted & remove sda6, expand sda3 to max-3Gb, make a new swap partition as sda4, activate it, have sda3 mounted at /home; & you're done.\n", "Q: Can wireless credential information be save with a guest user account What I have are laptops that have a customized user account and can auto-login and auto-launch Firefox browser.

The system swapped and became intermittently non-responsive (okay behavior).  Then while swap was at less than 10% of capacity, Chrome crashed (Sorry, the program \"chrome\" closed unexpectedly. Your computer does not have enough free memory to automatically analyze the problem and send a report to the developers).  Trying to get back to the dmesg output I was watching I got an error message that stated This window is not responding.  Do you want to force the application to exit, or wait for it to respond.  I selected 'wait'.  The desktop reappeared and the gnome system monitor went in and out of being greyed out several times while the system swapped.  When I checked back in, I was at the Ubuntu login screen.  I logged in as normal... all of my earlier running processes were gone and I was greeted with an error message identical to the one about Chrome in reference to Xorg.  Checking dmesg shows only the following two messages:\n[131267.206774] Watchdog[3433]: segfault at 0 ip 00007fe38faf9756 sp 00007fe37f393770 error 6 in chrome[7fe38be0a000+510c000]\n[133329.875212] nvidia 0000:03:00.0: irq 106 for MSI/MSI-X\n\nEDIT 3 \nOther possible relevant topics:\n\n\n*\n\n*The OOM killer may be called even when there is still plenty of memory available, although I still am not sure how to check if OOM was called.\n\n*Perhaps some configuration of pages_low / min_free_kbytes would get me to where I need to be, more directly related than swappiness, but I'm not seeing what [some sites suggest I should find in /proc/zoneinfo (I can't post a link: mariosmarduch.ulitzer.com/node/431838/mobile), but that may be because they aren't Ubuntu specific?\n\n*I can't post a link: www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2006/11/30/linux-out-of-memory.html?page=1\n\n\nEdit 4\nAdditional error messages:\n[92315.165728] Watchdog[1319]: segfault at 0 ip 00007f7d0a417756 sp 00007f7cf9cb1770 error 6 in chrome[7f7d06728000+510c000]\n[92656.478271] INFO: task Chrome_IOThread:1292 blocked for more than 120 seconds.\n[92656.478275]       Tainted: P           OX 3.13.0-45-generic #74-Ubuntu\n[92656.478276] \"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\n[92656.478278] Chrome_IOThread D ffff88207fc534c0     0  1292  32756 0x00000000\n[92656.478282]  ffff881fa9d15dd8 0000000000000086 ffff881fad2ab000 ffff881fa9d15fd8\n[92656.478285]  00000000000134c0 00000000000134c0 ffff881fad2ab000 ffff881fad2ab000\n[92656.478288]  ffff881f5fce6260 ffff881f5fce6268 ffffffff00000000 ffff881f5fce6270\n[92656.478290] Call Trace:\n[92656.478299]  [<ffffffff817252d9>] schedule+0x29/0x70\n[92656.478302]  [<ffffffff81727f55>] rwsem_down_write_failed+0x115/0x230\n[92656.478307]  [<ffffffff81371d63>] call_rwsem_down_write_failed+0x13/0x20\n[92656.478311]  [<ffffffff81314c90>] ? apparmor_file_mprotect+0x30/0x30\n[92656.478313]  [<ffffffff8172796d>] ? down_write+0x2d/0x30\n[92656.478318]  [<ffffffff8116ba7c>] vm_mmap_pgoff+0x6c/0xc0\n[92656.478322]  [<ffffffff8117f916>] SyS_mmap_pgoff+0x116/0x270\n[92656.478325]  [<ffffffff81018802>] SyS_mmap+0x22/0x30\n[92656.478328]  [<ffffffff8173196d>] system_call_fastpath+0x1a/0x1f\n\n\nA: Depending on what they are doing, Computers with large amounts of memory, such as yours, can get into difficulties when the amount of free memory (resident as opposed to swap) becomes very low. Sometimes (not sure for your situation) things can be improved by increasing the minimum amount of memory kept free, or /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes. Think of it as keeping more room free such that things are easier to move around and re-group and de-fragment and such. Try a very large number first, say 20G, and if that helps try to reduce it. You might also help yourself by watching \"free\" carefully in an attempt to correlate the issues with some minimum available memory.\nMethod 1 (script run as sudo):\n#! /bin/bash\ncat /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes\n\necho \"20000000\" > /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes\n\ncat /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes\n\nMethod 2 (direct command):\necho \"20000000\" | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes\n\n\nA: To find out if your processes have been killed by the OOM killer you can inspect the result of this command:\nsudo egrep -ri 'killed process' /var/log/ | grep -v auth.log\n\nIf this is the case you might want to look at the article about taiming the OOM Killer.\nhttp://lwn.net/Articles/317814/\n", "Q: Upgrade Win7 Home to Ultimate - will dual-boot with Ubuntu still work? / Partition access question \n*\n\n*I had Windows 7 Home Basic installed.Then I install Ubuntu and know I have dual boot. But I want to upgrade my Windows 7 to Ultimate version.Can I update my Windows 7 installation and keep my dual boot setup as well as my files from the old Windows 7 Home Basic?\n\n*From the Windows 7 installation, I can't access the Ubuntu partition, but from Ubuntu I can access the Windows 7 partition. If I get a virus on windows 7 which destroys my files, Ubuntu will still be safe there in dual boot, right?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*I don't know what the Upgrade will do with the Windows files, but I am quite sure that it will restore the boot loader to Microsoft, so your GRUB boot menu will be gone and the machine would boot straight into Windows, I suppose. But this can be fixed: Follow this answer here (maybe print it out) after the Upgrade, to restore the GRUB and fix the dual-boot. The Upgrade should not touch your Ubuntu partition, so it should be fine after that.\n\n*The Windows system can not access your Ubuntu partition, because it is formatted in ext4, which is unsupported by Windows without special drivers. And as applications use system calls to access the drives (normally), they can't access Ubuntu's files either, as long as they don't install their own driver (99.99999% will definitely not!) The only thing Windows (applications) can do to harm Ubuntu's files is to completely delete or reformat the partition. It is possible, but very unlikely, because viruses that are so aggressive are not very widespread. So you are pretty safe, but totally safe is only an external hdd you physically disconnect.\n\n", "Q: I Develop a project on \"monodevelop\" but stuck in debugging it from .exe file. What should I do? I have developed a project using monodevelop and saved it. The monodevelop as usual created a .exe file of it for me, But problem with the project is that,\"It works perfect, When I start debugging it with in the development environment. And when I close monodevelop app and want to access it from .exe file it pops up a window, Which says (Archive Manager an error occurred while load the archive)\". Now what should I install to erase this error.\n\nA: MonoDevelop is an IDE for making .NET applications that can run on anything with a .NET runtime. Your EXE can run on any Linux machine with Mono installed. The same file will also run on Windows (assuming you are using basic cross-platform practices). Applications like this are in the Portable Executable format, so they have the EXE extension that specifies this (Windows won't execute it otherwise).\n\"Mono\" is the name of an implementation of the .NET runtime for Linux systems. Since you are already using MonoDevelop, I bet your system already has Mono installed and working. You can run it with mono by using a command that is something like this:\nmono application.exe\n\nP.S. - I've noticed that explicitly specifying mono isn't necessary on my most updated systems. I don't know the details, but I can now execute such apps even more simply. Like any other linux application:\n./application.exe\n\n", "Q: Is there a program that I can use to find my drivers?

I have Windows XP on my first hard drive, and have installed a second empty hard drive.\nWhen I load the Ubuntu 14.04 installation disk and try to install, I chose Something Else\nto mean that I want to install Linux on the second empty hard drive. \nWhen I click install I get a message saying that I haven't specified a root and should use the partition table. \nEvery time I indicate repartition, I get the same message (\"no root\"). \nThe 14.04 installation disk is unclear about how to install on an empty second drive. If I select the side-by-side option for installation,\nthen it wants to install Linux on the same drive as XP, which is not what I want.\nThe empty hard drive is NTFS. Do I have to find some way to reformat it for ext4 without the Ubuntu installation disk, and then try to install?? The menus on the 14.04\ninstallation disk are very poorly written.\n\nA: A few assumptions first... Windows is installed on /dev/sda, the first hard drive recognized by the system, and Ubuntu will be installed on /dev/sdb\nClick through the first steps of the installer until you get to the disk detection step. Even if you do not want to create partitions manually select Something else, then click Continue.\nClick here for a screen shot\nThe Advanced Partitioning Tool should be open now. You should see the disks and partitions connected to the computer. At the top of the list is sda, where WinXP is installed. You do not want to mess with that one. Any action you take here MUST be on sdb, the target disk for Ubuntu. If there are existing partitions on it, as in this example, delete them. You do that by selecting each partition and clicking Delete.\nClick here for a screen shot\nAfter all of the partitions under sdb have been deleted, select the free space and click Add.\nClick here for a screen shot\nThe first partition you want to add is going to be mounted at /boot. This is the boot partition and early on, doesn't take up much space, but let's be a little generous to allow for growth that comes with system upgrades. A size of 500 MB is the default on most Linux distributions. The default file system is ext4. Unless you know what you are doing, there is no reason to choose any other. Click OK.\nClick here for a screen shot\nThe second partition will be the root partition. Because resizing a non-LVM disk partition is not a trivial matter, be generous with disk allocation here, too. Pictured is about 15G, but I'd shoot for 20G, especially if you're using a second disk. It's not sharing the space with another OS so you can afford to be generous. Be sure to select / as the mount point, and stick with the default file system type. Click OK.\nClick here for a screen shot\nFor the partition where your home directory will be located, allocate as much disk space as you can afford. Do not skimp on disk space here. More is better, utilize all remaining space. For the mount point, be sure to select /home. Click OK.\nClick here for a screen shot\nLastly, create the swap partition. A good measure is to use minimally the size of your RAM, maximum double your RAM. Select swap area from the Use as dropdown menu, then click OK.\nClick here for a screen shot\nThat should bring you back to the main disk partitioning window, where all the partitions you just created should be listed. Before clicking Install Now, you want to make sure that the Device for boot loader installation is /dev/sdb. Else the installer will be overwriting Windows’s boot programs in the Master Boot Record of sda.\nClick here for a screen shot\nAt this point, continue installation as any other.

It is dangerous to write on NTFS partition while Windows uses hybrid boot because there is a potential risk of data loss. So I tried to mount Windows 8 partition as read-only in Ubuntu, now I wonder if it is safe to access the partition in Ubuntu or not?\n\nA: \nIt is dangerous to write on NTFS partition while Windows uses hybrid boot\n\nUbuntu will refuse to mount an unsafe NTFS partition writable. So it is not a matter of \"dangerous\"; it is a matter of Ubuntu not letting you. \nIf you would be able to write to it the next time you boot into Windows those changes would be gone. That is what you would call \"data loss\". \n\nnow I wonder if it is safe to access the partition in Ubuntu or not?\n\nAs read only it is safe.

I've developed several utility scripts that solve specific problems of my team's day-to-day work.\nUntil now what I have done to deploy the script in my co-workers' laptops is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Every solution has a main.sh script (as well as other scripts and supporting files)\n\n*Create a folder in the user's home folder and put the files there\n\n*Add an alias either to .bashrc or .bash_aliases, depending of the Linux distribution, pointing to the main.sh script\n\n*Copy autocompletion file to /etc/bash_completion.d/ (completion file name is the same as the alias plus .auto extension).\n\n*Copy man page to /usr/share/man/man1/ then gzipping it (man file name is the same as the alias plus .1 extension).\n\n\nI would like to create an installer but the alias part is tricky.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a better option that would also allow for automation (installer)?\n\n*Maybe putting a soft link to the main.sh file in /usr/local/bin instead of creating aliases? \n\n*Is there a best-practice for this?\n\n\nA: I think you are right, adding a soft link to /usr/local/bin would be much better and doing a real .deb package for your scripts\n\nA: There are configuration management and automation programs that can do exactly what you need. Rather than going through all the computers and manually do the same work over and over again, you should seriously use any of the automation/orchestration tools.\nUsing these tools you can just create a file containg the steps and then run the file on your co-workers computer easily. As a suggestion you should try ansible first as it is easy to understand and work over SSH (Does not require any additional client program). Furthermore it has tons of other important features.\nAs for /usr/local/bin case, the other answer is right i think.\n", "Q: What is the difference between scrub and shred? I know both are for secure file deletion, but when should one be used instead of the other? Do both overwrite files with 0's?\n\nA: Both commands overwrite data using patterns. Which to use in what situations will most certainly be a matter of opinion, I would likely shred a file and scrub a disk, However as that's just my opinion, the following information may be useful to you.\n SHRED:  Note  that shred relies on a very important assumption: that the file system overwrites data in place.  This is the tradi‐\n   tional way to do things, but many modern file system designs do not satisfy this assumption.  The following  are  examples  of  file\n   systems on which shred is not effective, or is not guaranteed to be effective in all file system modes:\n\n   * log-structured or journaled file systems, such as those supplied with AIX and Solaris (and JFS, ReiserFS, XFS, Ext3, etc.)\n\n   * file systems that write redundant data and carry on even if some writes fail, such as RAID-based file systems\n\n   * file systems that make snapshots, such as Network Appliance's NFS server\n\n   * file systems that cache in temporary locations, such as NFS version 3 clients\n\n   * compressed file systems\n\n   In  the  case  of  ext3 file systems, the above disclaimer applies (and shred is thus of limited effectiveness) only in data=journal\n   mode, which journals file data in addition to just metadata.  In both the data=ordered (default)  and  data=writeback  modes,  shred\n   works as usual.  Ext3 journaling modes can be changed by adding the data=something option to the mount options for a particular file\n   system in the /etc/fstab file, as documented in the mount man page (man mount).\n\n   In addition, file system backups and remote mirrors may contain copies of the file that cannot be removed, and  that  will  allow  a\n   shredded file to be recovered later.\n\nSource 'man shred'\nScrub:\n\nImage Source: Software Center\n", "Q: How does Snappy relate to Nix and Guix? I searched for a comparison but found non and am not quite well informed enough to do it myself right now.\nAll of them provide transactional updates, but different levels of containment. \n\n\n*\n\n*Snappy statically compiles in libraries to provide multiple versions of binary dependencies. It declares provided (and needed?) services as metadata. The package is provided as a single image?\n\n*Nix deals with dynamic linking to provide multiple versions of binary dependencies? It declares provided and needed services as metadata. The package is provided through a repository dealing with dependencies.\n\n*Guix is like Nix, but features GNU integration.\n\n\nA more in depth comparison between Nix and Guix is given by Sander van der Burg, which I did not study in detail. I would guess someone at Canonical has made an analysis of existing solutions. There are other deployment systems based on images, like CoreOS I was told.\nSo, how does Snappy Ubuntu relate to Nix and Guix? What are major differences?\n\nA: Recently, I did an evaluation myself. I'm actually a Nix/NixOS contributor, and former researcher interested in deployment technology.\nI have tried to stick myself to the facts as much as possible, but it's probably impossible to remain fully unbiased. To summarize my findings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both approaches store packages in isolation. Snappy stores apps and frameworks in folders using the following name convention: /app/name/version.vendor, whereas Nix uses /nix/store/hash-name-version.\nNix's naming convention is more powerful, because it uses hash prefixes that are derived from all buildtime dependencies. With Nix you can easily make distinctions between any variant of a package and store them next to each other. Any change (e.g. different build procedure, library upgrade, compiler upgrade) yields a new hash making making it possible to store any possible variant next to each other.\n\n*To allow a package to find its dependencies, Nix binds them statically to an executable (e.g. by modifying the RPATH of an ELF binary) or by wrapping them in scripts that set the appropriate environment variables (e.g. CLASSPATH, PYTHONPATH, PERL5LIB, etc.).\nSnappy composes containers in which executables can find their dependencies in their common FHS locations, such as /lib and /bin\nHowever, Nix also supports Snappy's container approach but this is only used in very rare cases. The most prominent Nix package using a containerized approach is Steam in NixOS, because Steam is a deployment tool itself with conflicting properties.\n\n*The Snappy Ubuntu Core uses a so-called \"A/B\" partitioning scheme to upgrade (and roll back) the base system. It only supports a limited number of versions (typically two) at the time.\nIn contrast, NixOS (the Nix-based Linux distro) composes the base system out of Nix packages in the Nix store as well and is much more powerful. You can roll back to any previous configuration that has not been garbage collected yet. Moreover, similar system packages among generations can be shared.\n\n*Both tools support unprivileged user installations. However, Snappy stores all files in the home directory of the user. If two users happen to install the same package then they are installed twice on the system. \nIn contrast, Nix packages also allow ordinary users to install packages in the central Nix store so that identical packages can be shared among users. Partly because of the naming convention (using hashing) this can be done in a secure way.\n\n*Snappy restricts the runtime behaviour of packages out-of-the-box whereas Nix does not\n\n*Snappy does not seem to help users to construct packages from source code. Nix however has a DSL allowing people to do this quite easily and automatically install all buildtime dependencies (compilers, build tools, libraries etc.) when needed\n\n*Snappy hardly supports modularization and reuse. In the example packages, all library dependencies are bundled statically consuming much more diskspace and RAM. Moreover, the documentation does not seem to provide any facilities except frameworks. However, frameworks are not meant for reuse according to the documentation\nWith Nix modularizing packages and safely managing dependencies are some its key features.\nThe full blog post can be found here: http://sandervanderburg.blogspot.com/2015/04/an-evaluation-and-comparison-of-snappy.html\nHopefully you find it interesting to read and maybe there are some things in it that you find worth thinking about.\n", "Q: Resizing filesystems I have following filesystems on my Ubuntu 12.04:\nu@czarnobog:~$ df -hT\nFilesystem          Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/md1-md1 ext4       31G   27G  2.7G  91% /\nudev                devtmpfs   16G  4.0K   16G   1% /dev\ntmpfs               tmpfs     3.2G  428K  3.2G   1% /run\nnone                tmpfs     5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone                tmpfs      16G     0   16G   0% /run/shm\nnone                tmpfs     100M     0  100M   0% /run/user\n/dev/mapper/md3-md3 ext4       97G   43G   49G  47% /export\n/dev/mapper/md2-md2 ext4      7.7G  5.6G  1.8G  77% /var\ncm_processes        tmpfs      16G  2.6G   14G  17% /run/cloudera-scm-agent/process\n\nIs it possible to transfer some free space from one to another, for example 10 gigs from /dev/mapper/md3-md3  to /dev/mapper/md1-md1?

Mine was less powerful (Core2 Duo E8400 @ 3 GHz, GeForce GT 8800) and still ran quite well and responsive (outside of the few occasions in which I wanted to crunch some numbers, compile large pieces of software, or play modern video games).\nIf the open source Radeon driver aren't enough for you (e. g. for modern 3D video games), you should give the closed source driver from AMD another try. Start with What is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD? and post a new question, if you run into issues.\nAs for the restricted main memory there are two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're on a 32-bit installation, but you'd be better off with a 64-bit one. The latter would make full use of your main memory and run (especially) arithmetic operations a little faster.\nYou can check with uname -m. i386 mean 32-bit, x86_64 means 64-bit. If you decide to re-install Ubuntu, you can even continue to use your old settings, if you don't format the target file system in the process.\n\n*Your integrated graphics adapter uses some of the main memory as graphics memory. If you have an integrated and a dedicated graphics adapter, you may want to disable the integrated one to release the memory, if you don't care about the higher power consumption.\n\nA: Try to get your 3dcard working properly.  You might have to find a driver from a third party as Radeon might not have a driver for linux, if that doesn't work i know Unity doesn't play nice with certain chip sets.

Do you want to then parse the web page and show only the text in the terminal? then it gets more complicated and you need to start looking at a concept called \"screen scraping\". By then, you're really looking at having to program this yourself, so in order to get adequate guidance you'd need to tell us about your profile, whether you're comfortable programming, which languages you know, and so on.\nI guess a basic question is, why do you want to do this in the terminal and not on a browser?\n\nA: I tried with Lynx and seem to work ok. Of course, you have to consider the UI limitations due to the use of a terminal instead of a browser. \nIn order to install lynx type:\nsudo apt-get install lynx\n\nIn order to use it, e.g. with the web you wanted, type:\nlynx www.etymonline.com\n\nNote that you should browse the buttons with TAB key or with the mouse complement that comes with lynx.

Say you have two computers with different hardware (two laptops or a laptop and a desktop) that you want to use alternatively. For example, I am using the comfortable desktop now, and want to mirror all documents and settings to a laptop to travel, and then push changes back to the desktop when back at home. Both have same OS (Ubuntu 14.04LTS 64bits), same installed packages and (for the sake of simplicity) a single user (same name, same password).\nHere is how you can sync (I will use rsync over SSH on a direct Ethernet cable between two laptops) and here is what you should sync to mirror folders and settings. Also, here you can find a great list of files and folders that may be left out for efficiency when the goal is a backup (though some may be useful in this case, like histories, recent files or some caches) and, again, here is a nice and practical way to do it in rsync.\nI know that most hardware-specific configuration files should be out of user folders by design. Still, there are any files/folders within /home that must be left out of this sync to avoid configuration problems between different hardwares?\n\nA: \nI know that most hardware-specific configuration files should be out of user folders by design.

Is there any way to create a /home partition with more than 160GB? I tried to create a /home partition on both drives, but then it told me that I couldn't install Ubuntu with multiple /home partitions. \n\nA: It seems like you need a bit more information on the Linux directory system: You have one root directory / on your system. And this is where you have a number of folders like /home, /dev, /usr, /etc and so on. Some of the folders really exist on the disk, like home, usr and etc, but some are only virtual like proc or dev and contain temporary system/process/device info/represent them.  \nNow you have to understand that EVERY machine has this equal basic structure, independent of the underlying partitions. Every partition you mount gets placed into this one file system tree and bind to one specific directory. So e.g. your /home directory points to the partition sdb1 (which is represented by /dev/sdb1 by the way) while your /boot folder is located at sda1 and the rest of / is in sda2.\nYou can also just create a new folder like ~/data and bind the partition to this new folder.\nSo for your system you can say the following:\nThe only two partitions you need are / (the tree root) and swap (which does not get included into the tree). Then all data in any real directory under / would be stored in the root partition.\nWhat you can do now is to take specific directories out of the root partition / and assign their own partition to them. Commonly you do this for /home and sometimes for /boot.  \nIt is easy to do this at install time (select \"do something else\" when it ask whether it should install instead/alongside other OS and do the partitioning manually), but a bit more difficult to change it later, as you have to manually move the contents from the old directory to the new partition before you bind it. But it is of course possible and - this is the big advantage of this directory system - applications will not see any changes, as they still can access their files as before, because the path (e.g. /home/myusername/.mygame/hiscore) to all files stayed the same.\nSo what do you exactly want to do now and on which topic do you need further help?\n\n image source:\nhttp://h0lug.sourceforge.net/ForrestHo00/samples/ooo11/openOfficeEmbeddedImage/zip-Sernet-LATM-LPI-101-v-0.2-20050712-1243-noXSO.sxw/file-Pictures/10000000000002D00000021CF2F25855.png \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 not shown in operating system list I had a working Ubuntu 11.04 installation, alongside Windows Vista.

That's all fine and dandy.\nHowever, what I need to do is download the files in there with a specific type of naming pattern.  It's pulling down json files that are being spit out by API calls to a specific server, but I need it to be saved in a specific pattern such as foo_1.json, and because it's not actually linking to a foo_1.json file it won't save it as such.\nIs there any way to expand upon the wget functionality to save files it downloads in a specific filename pattern, say, sequentially?\nIf not, alternative CLI methods not using wget are acceptable.\n\nA: You could always use a shell loop:\nwhile read url; do wget -O foo_$((++i)).json \"$url\"; done < list.txt\n\nThe file list.txt is your list of URLs, one per line. This is read by the while loop, each URL is saved as $url, wget downloads it and the -O flag tells it to save to a file called foo_N.json where N is the current value of $i.

I used  \"sound converter\" to convert the audio files.   Yet every burner reports that I,m over exceeding my\nminute limit.\nI don't get it.  I can only assume that the converter is the problem and that the new audio info isn't being read by the burners.   Reading in fact what it was and not what it is...     \n\nA: As mozzbozz said, your burning program obviously creates a standard audio cd to playback on every cd player. Therefore all audio files are converted into cd audio format. You ever heard of cd quality as reference for good audio quality in comparison with compressed formats like mp3? All standard audio cds have 44,1kHz sampling rate and 16bit stereo, no matter what the source had. \nSo you have to burn something like an mp3 cd, but this can not be read by old players. Or you have to burn at least 4-5 standard audio cds, but then you can have excellent quality and play it on every device.

Both of these work on my machine with the lp variant (lubuntu 14.04), but the lpr variant does not work in either case. lpr origionally was not installed, and so I did \"apt-get install lpr\", which seemed to install successfully.\nThe problem is that when I run either of the above lpr variants, I get \"lpr: lp: unknown printer\".

To install an lpr program for CUPS you need to install the package cups-bsd instead of lpr.\nThe package lpr contains the BSD lpd printer spooler. Its lpr programm doesn't know about your default printer for CUPS but tries to use the printer lp which doesn't exist on your system. \n", "Q: Adduser and setting up files for each new user Does Ubuntu have a directory where new users get the default folder contents?

After the system has been running for 8 hours continuously, it becomes slow. When I faced the same situation on Windows, I used CCleaner to clean memory, which used to give me a little boost.\nIs there any application or command that cleans the unused existing RAM memory (browsers, temp files, prefetch operating system files, etc.) like CCleaner does in Windows?\n\nA: \"Memory\" and \"temporary files\" are different things. \nMemory is normally RAM. Linux manages its RAM automatically, no cleaning needed; if there is some process misbehaving and using too much RAM, you just stop it. Browsers are classical offenders there; I need to close mine (and restart) every couple of weeks. Gnome-shell is another well-known memory leaker. \nFor the file part, you can install Ubuntu Tweak and use the janitor module: \n\nSee also How safe is Ubuntu tweak's Janitor?. You can also install it using a PPA, look here in WebUpd8 (it's still ok for 14.04). \nConsider anyway that if you clear a cache, the data will need to be reloaded/rebuilt, so the effect is, most of the time, to slow things down(1). For example, clearing the nautilus thumbnails means they are to be rebuilt again --- slowing down file browsing. \n(1) the only exception here is the apt-cache and the old kernels --- in normal condition, on desktop, they are almost always just lost space. \nIf your system is really slowing down a \"rogue\" or leaking application is the most common reason. Try to catch it with top or similar tools, and if you find it, post a more specific question or a bug report. \n\nA: You can free memory without installing more software by writing to the drop_caches file in the /proc/sys/vm directory. \nFirst you will want to use a program like top or free to view the RAM usage and availability: \n$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:         31730      31118        611      16606         57      25018\n-/+ buffers/cache:       6042      25687\nSwap:        32313          0      32313\n\nNext you will need to execute the following command:\nsudo sysctl vm.drop_caches=3\n\n(which is roughly equivalent to the slightly more cumbersome sudo sh -c 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'.)\nThen run the free command and review the output:\n$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:         31730       6224      25505        121          2        518\n-/+ buffers/cache:       5702      26027\nSwap:        32313          0      32313\n\nBelow are links to article that identify the process and documentation regarding the use of the drop_caches file.\n\nSources and further reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Free up RAM On Ubuntu/Debian\n\n*Documentation of /proc/sys/vm.\n\n\nA: BleachBit from the Ubuntu Software Centre is also a useful consideration. It deletes unnecesssary files to free valuable disk space, maintain privacy and remove junk amongst other things.\n\nA: 1 Foreword\nIt's a bit strange that your system gets sightly slower after 8 hours. Since you also face the same problem on windows I guess this may be a hardware issue.\nWithout more information it is hard to say, but if you are lucky a RAM upgrade may help. If not, you maybe have to face a bigger hardware problem in the future.\n2 Definitions and Distictions\nRAM, temp-files, system-files and prefetch are different things.\n\n\n*\n\n*On Linux systems you don't need RAM cleaners.\nIf a process uses \"too much\" RAM stop and restart it. Such memory-leaking programs are often browsers and browser plug-ins. I also saw X.org misbehaving sometimes.\n\n*Temporary files only use some storage. So they won't slow down your system.\n\n*There is a reason why they are called system files. Most of them are used to run your system and programs like you are used to it. So if you don't know what you are doing, don't mess around with them!\n\n*Prefetching is Windows-specific. The Linux or Ubuntu equivalent is called (u)readahead.\nYou don't have to think about it on Linux systems.\n3 Software Recommendations\n\n\n*\n\n*I recommend BleachBit: It's a good file-cleaner and (also in root-mode) you can hardly mess up your system.\nTo install it open your terminal and type\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bleachbit\n\ntype your password (no characters will be displayed) and wait till executed.\n\n*Till Ubuntu 12.04 you can use computer-janitor: But if you don't know what you are doing be careful.

This is my story and I'm stickin' to it\nLast year I built a Home Theater PC (HTPC) with an AMD A6-6400K processor. It has a built in GPU, just two other Intel systems in the household. I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on it because it was latest and greatest and I loved Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe HTPC is purpose built. We watch movies, Netflix and stuff on the net. That's about it. It has been wonderful. It was a huge improvement over the, um, smart TV.\nThen the Dec 12 2014 update to the 3.13.0.43 kernel gave an unrecoverable BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH. Had to switch off the power and then frantically try to get the grub recovery menu on power up. Learned how to set the default to the 3.13.0.39 kernel after that.\nBoot hangs after upgrade to kernel 3.13.0-43\nThe 3.13.0.44 kernel update a month later corrected this problem. But the mousepad seemed slow and erratic. Changed batteries and swore a lot. Tried using it sober. Didn't make a difference. \nThen another 14.04 LTS update to the kernel 3.13.0.45 occurred in Feb 2015. After that a Downton Abbey .mkv file FAILED to play using either vlc or totem (the default video viewer). \nThe top command revealed that the CPU running over 100% (single core) in play mode. Even when paused vlc was running at 50%. Another process called compiz was running at 90% and the allcore metric clocked in at 60% -- on pause. This made no sense at all. \nThen I read this:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz/+bug/1293384\nand this\nhttps://tim.siosm.fr/blog/2014/04/25/why-not-ubuntu-14.04-lts\nI tried the GNOME/metacity desktop to avoid using compiz. The totem player almost worked but the picture was choppy and frames went missing. vlc rendered a terrible picture.\nAll of this happened with the default Ubuntu open source drivers (i.e. no additional drivers installed).\nAn earlier attempt to use the latest AMD drivers ended in frustration -- a 46\" image rendered on a 50\" TV and with no way to adjust that.  An AMD tweak program didn't get installed properly so there was no way of adjusting an 8% underscan or even being aware of this bizarre default setting. But I got around that.\nFollow the instruction here. And then do this reinstall the AMD Command Control Center. Then adjust to 0% underscan:\ncd <the dir with the .deb files>\ndpkg -P fglrx-amdcccle\ndpkg -i fglrx-amdccle_<whatever_version_is_here>.deb\n\nEverything works great again after successfully installing the AMD proprietary drivers and making adjustments for a normal screen (0% underscan). The episode of Downton Abbey now uses only 16% of a a single core running full screen with VLC.\nThere is a point here. Really.\nThe last two months of Ubuntu 14.04 Long Term Support (LTS) software updates have been hell. I'm used to software updates fixing problems that I didn't know existed. Annoying yes, but never that time consuming. A small price to pay for that sense of security.\nBut these last few updates have crippled this HTPC more than once, leaving me stranded on the road, as it were, with the wife asking why we aren't using Windows? Grrrrr.\nAnd I'm embarrassed to say how much of my life was flushed away fixing these updates. Time I'll never get back.\nAfter using Microsoft all my life, I switched to Ubuntu 11.04. Loved it. Same with 12.04. But 14.04 has sucked. BIG TIME. So now I'm considering these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Suspending all software updates except on a need-to-have basis.\n\n*Ubuntu is overkill and stupid on an HTPC. Install something else.\nMint? OpenELEC?\n\n*Rollback to 12.04 LTS? Ugh.\n\n*Stick with 14.04 LTS and hope lightening does not strike a 3rd time?\n\n*It's time to move on. Suggestions? Anything but Windows.\n\n\nThis is a serious question.\n\nA: What is going on? Most of your problems can be summed up with one statement:\nAMD's closed source driver is awful.\nAnd the open source one isn't very much better. It's probably better than the Nvidia open driver but it still has plenty of flaws and spotty hardware support. Often finding an acceptable outcome means manually balancing driver and kernel versions against versions of X and even applications.\nYou could try upgrading to the 14.10's kernel+driver+X with the HWE stack:\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-utopic  \n\nYou'll be able to do something similar when 15.04 and 15.10 are released.\nBut in the future note the hardware support before you buy things. At the moment,\nif you want a frictionless experience, you don't buy an AMD GPU.\n\nA: Compiz is an eye-candy, but for improved performance I always recommend installing CompizConfig Settings Manager ( which you can find in the Software Center ), and tweaking the settings somewhat: disable animations and use fast texture filter under OpenGL settings. \nAmong other things, get rid of start up services that you don't need.\nUsing a different desktop environment, like lxde or xfce, definitely helps alleviate the pressure on the system. Personally, I use Gnome, and before that - used Cinnamon.\nIf you are adventurous enough, you can even try switching to icewm window manager, which should be lighter. \nMore information on overall tuning of Ubuntu performance can be found here.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch - how to create Unity .desktop launcher to make UT terminal to open and execute a command? I have latest Ubuntu Touch installed on Nexus 7.\nI just apt-get installed there 'emacs' package. Currently I open Terminal application in Ubuntu Touch and key in \"emacs\" to get it launched.\nI want to create .desktop launcher to start emacs in terminal (-nw) mode right from the Ubuntu Touch Unity desktop.\nI want to keep using the new Ubuntu Touch terminal application as a shell to run emacs  because the ubuntu touch terminal allows me to customise its toolbar to include custom shortcuts I need to use emacs with virtual keyboard. Like CTRL-X, CTRL-@, etc.\nNormal gnome-terminal does not look good because there would not be this helpful toolbar and I do not always use ubuntu touch with hardware keyboard available.\nBesides, when I apt-get installed gnome-terminal and added gnome-terminal -e \"emacs -nw\" into my launcher, as kindly suggested below - this does not work, neither gnome-germinal nor emacs window appears, just short 'start app' animation. And gnome-terminal is not nice because of it missing the custom keys toolbar, so I guess this is dead-end for me. \nSo I guess the question is - how should I modify the existing .desktop launcher for Ubuntu Touch Terminal application to make it open emacs on its launch?\nHere is slightly cut default Ubuntu Touch terminal app .desktop launcher. How should I modify it to make it start emacs in terminal mode when clicked?\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=aa-exec-click -p com.ubuntu.terminal_terminal_0.7.49 -- terminal\nIcon=/custom/click/.click/users/@all/com.ubuntu.terminal/terminal64.png\nName=Terminal\nX-Ubuntu-Touch=true\nX-Ubuntu-Default-Department-ID=accessories\nPath=/custom/click/.click/users/@all/com.ubuntu.terminal\nX-Ubuntu-Old-Icon=terminal64.png\nX-Ubuntu-Application-ID=com.ubuntu.terminal_terminal_0.7.49\nName[en_US]=com.ubuntu.terminal_terminal_0.7.49.txt\n\nHere is what I tried to put into the above launcher and what did not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Exec=aa-exec-click -p com.ubuntu.terminal_terminal_0.7.49 -- terminal emacs\n\n*Exec=aa-exec-click -p com.ubuntu.terminal_terminal_0.7.49 -- terminal -e \"emacs -nw\"\n\nA: I guess you are trying to launch Emacs in Ubuntu's builtin terminal, don't you?\nThen, you have to launch the terminal app and pass the command for it to execute. For example you could do it with gnome terminal using command\ngnome-terminal -e \"emacs -nw\"\n\nI don't have an Ubuntu Touch's terminal installed so I won't check if it accepts commands to execute via program arguments and what the syntax is. If so, then the command to put in the .desktop file would look similar to the one above.\nEmacs GUI is probably impossible to run on Ubuntu touch until running XMir apps lands in the production images - I have no device to install UT on and have no information whether it has happened by now.\n", "Q: How to set and unset a global proxy with only one command I want to set the proxy for apt-get and the global proxy in xubuntu like here but with only one command.

Then some day I changed this back to \"login needed after reboot\" but for some reason the previous no-login configuration was removed improperly from all the config files. \nNow can login again :-)\nA note on the bounty / \"grading\":\nThe first answerer was closest to the solution by saying something like \"look closely at what's in /etc/pam.d\". The answer was also the longest and the most thorough.\nHowever I checked all the other answers as valuable, that's all I can do for now, I think.\n\nA: In theory you can walk through the contents of /etc/pam.d and compare against the output from /var/log/auth.log to see what is going on.  \nIn case you're not aware, each file in pam.d is a potential entry point to ask pam if you can get authority.  In your case lightdm.  The log entries are fairly self explanatory as far as figuring out which lines in the log come from which lines in the pam file.  \nAccording to the docs I found you should be able to add 'debug' to lines in pam.d files to get extra info in the log.  \nIn my setup, I'm using kde, and kdm and I get lots of lines containing (kdm:auth) when I lock my screen and attempt to unlock it (with the wrong password), but nothing when it unlocks successfully.  The is next to no comparison between pam.d/kdm and pam.d/lightdm which makes no sense to me, so maybe you can try swapping things around to see if the issue is in the lightdm pam module.  \nThe only other thought I had, is whether you have interesting symbols or characters in your password.  If the lightdm lock screen box, isn't coded properly you might find it's not sending what you type to the back end.  Try changing your password to something basic (like 1234) to see if it works, if it does, then (change your password back obviously, but) it probably means there is nothing wrong with your pam configuration at least.  \nSorry if this doesn't help much, beyond looking at adding pam_debug.so to various pam files (see http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/pam_debug.8.html), to see what happens, I'm not sure what else to suggest.  \n\nA: The lockscreen runs its authentication as a regular user, whereas user switching and the login screen run as root.  Root has special privileges a regular user doesn't.\nUsually when I've seen this problem, it's turned out that the permissions on the file /etc/shadow have been changed.  The should look something like this.\n$ ls -l /etc/shadow\n-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 2202 Jun 23 12:39 /etc/shadow\n\nIf the perms, owner, or group are wrong, that's your problem right there.\n\nA: Perhaps the solutions in Desktop login fails, terminal works will work for you?\nThey removed the ~/.Xauthority file.\nOr here? https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/64545/suddenly-i-cant-login-with-correct-password-greeter-tty\nSeems to be the same issue you're experiencing. For that second link, you may want to try simply running the last part of the commands, ignoring the apt-get purging: sudo pam-auth-update.\n\nA: Your answer (in your edit) did not really solve my issue but the accepted answer and your way of solving yours in the edit lead me to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*commenting the following line\n#auth  sufficient  pam_succeed_if.so user ingroup nopasswdlogin\n\n*changing \nauth  requisite  pam_nologin.so to auth  requisite  pam_permit.so\nside note: no need for restart after changing these lines just type this into the terminal : sudo /usr/sbin/pam-auth-update and then without changing anything in the menu hit enter on your keyboard\n", "Q: Flashing screen with Ubuntu 14.04 I had a dual boot which had Ubuntu 14.04 with the latest Nvidia driver installed, so far, so good.

Now this container file was limited to 2GB size, so not much additional software fit into it. Sure I could figure that out but never managed to do it. Then to get to Debian command prompt I had to start the 'Lil Debi' app, click \"mount and start debian\" button, click \"Open Terminal\" button, manually delete with keyboard some garbage text from terminal line which appeared in new terminal, then start /debian/shell and there was problem with this script because on my 4.4 Cyanogen it failed to pass environment variables to Debian chroot environment, so more hassle with that too. Then I could finally run my emacs and start using this application in terminal mode. Then this setup was eating battery even when idle (even with all prevent wifi/system/screen/etc disabled in Lil Debi settings). I had my tablet left in sleep mode with idle Lil Debi command prompt and over night I've got full deep discharge from initial ~30% charge. Then non-latin symbols in terminal were not correctly displayed. Sure I could figure this out too - just more time wasted. And the above setup does not seem to work under latest Lollipop Android version - Lil Debi just fails to create/mount contained for Debial chroot environment. Sure this will sometimes be fixed and I could stay on Android 4.4, but still.\nNow with Ubuntu touch I have working terminal out of box. It supports non-latin characters correctly out of box. It does not seem to consume excessive amount of power. It is only limited by the total storage memory of my device, not by 2GB chroot container file. And its terminal supports cursor movement top/down by screen swipes. And it allows me to customise the special keyboard shortcuts in its bar so I have all the CTRL-X, CTRL-@ and such even without physical keyboard attached. This allows me to use emacs with just virtual keyboard just OK. Sure not for extended sessions but good for quick picking into the data.\nYay! Ubuntu Touch seems good enough for me as terminal machine. So on my Nexus 7 I prefer running Ubuntu Touch and not Android anymore. Yes, my need is specific and not mass-market, but I am happy with Ubuntu Touch!\n", "Q: How to re-enable or re-install outer glow effect on windows edges and transparency effect on drag?

For my motherboard (access this at boot, not through Ubuntu) I went to Advanced > System Agent > Graphics > iPGU Multi-Monitor and set it to \"enable.\"  I left all of the other system agent graphics settings on auto.  After that the boot and ACPI problems (including a shutdown hang, crashes, freezes, monitor shutdown) stopped.\nEvery motherboard vendor has its own settings.  The problem seems to be a northbridge snafu between the onboard Intel graphics and the Nvidia card.  So, it may takes several visits to your motherboard setup to find the right combination of settings that works for you.  This problem was new to me under 15.04, and may be due to a change in how Ubuntu handles such graphics disputes.\n(My motherboard is ASUS P8Z77-V LX LGA 1155 Intel Z77)\n\nA: Apparently it is a harmless message related to a 'PCC' driver:\n\nSo it looks like you build the PCC mailbox driver which is new in 3.19-rc and\n  that driver fails to load, because it doesn't find hardware to work with.\nThe message is harmless, but it also is not useful.

So I looked around, and yes, I can change bash's title so that it doesn't display the username and computer.\nBut that only partially solves the problem, because even if I only have the pwd as the title, it grows really fast.

They are enough for office and some games, but of course they get far less power out of your graphics hardware than a proprietary driver would do. Its advantage is that it is open-source and pretty stable, while proprietary drivers (e.g. those from nVidia) often cause problems and are complicated to install correctly.\nSo you have to decide between simplicity, flexibility and stability (Xorg) and advanced capabilities and best use of the card's power (proprietary).\n", "Q: Can't commission node in MAAS due to \"Failed to power on node\" error I have three nodes in my Maas, but when I select commission nodes it displays error:\nERROR    Tue, 10 Feb. 2015 11:33:08  Failed to power on node — Timeout after 7 tries\n\nWARNING  Tue, 10 Feb. 2015 11:34:04     Failed to query node's BMC — Node could not be queried node-15d171e8-a6dc-11e4-8e2b-0030487c9128 (node1) invalid hostname\n\nThis is message from one node.

Do I need to do more things? Help me use ubuntu from my pendrive. Thanks in advance. \n\nUpdate: I tried for solutions here and here. Nothing helped. They were just stuffs related to liveUSB creation which is not my case.  \n\nA: The 4GB USB drive is too small for a full install of Ubuntu 14.04\nThe installer should have refused to install Ubuntu in a 3.5 GB partition. A full install requires about 5GB / partition. So you will need at least an 8 GB USB drive. I recommend a 16 or 32 GB drive if you intend to install many programs and store large personal files.\nOne thing to remember when you install Ubuntu on an USB drive, from a Live USB is to make sure you choose the correct destination drive for installation as well as the bootloader location.\nYour drives are denoted by /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc etc. Say /dev/sdc is the correct USB drive (check by size). Then during install make sure you choose /dev/sdc for bootloader location. Don't choose partitions inside such as /dev/sdc1. Choosing the whole drive (rather than a partition in it) will install the bootloader in the MBR of that USB drive.\nThere are other ways of doing a full install in an USB, such as using a virtual machine. See How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator) for more details.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Placing many (10 million) files in one folder I've just added a predictive search (see example below) feature to my site that runs on a Ubuntu Server. This runs direct from a database. I want to cache the result for each search and use that if it exists, else create it.\nWould there be any problem with me saving the potential cira 10 million results in separate files in one directory? Or is it advisable to split them down into folders?\nExample:\n\n\nA: Ended up with same issue. Run my own benchmarks to find out if you can place everything in the same folder vs. having multiple folders. It appears you can and it's faster!\n\nRef: https://medium.com/@hartator/benchmark-deep-directory-structure-vs-flat-directory-structure-to-store-millions-of-files-on-ext4-cac1000ca28\n\nA: \nWould there be any problem with me saving the potential circa 10 million results in separate files in one directory?\n\nYes. There probably are more reasons but these I can post off the top of my head:\n\n\n*\n\n*tune2fs has an option called dir_index that tends to be turned on by default (on Ubuntu it is) that lets you store roughly 100k files in a directory before you see a performance hit. That is not even close to the 10m files you are thinking about. \n\n*ext filesystems have a fixed maximum number of inodes. Every file and directory uses 1 inode. Use df -i for a view of your partitions and inodes free. When you run out of inodes you can not make new files or folders.\n\n*commands like rm and ls when using wildcards expand the command and will end up with a \"argument list too long\". You will have to use find to delete or list files. And find tends to be slow. \n\nOr is it advisable to split them down into folders?\n\nYes. Most definitely. Basically you can not even store 10m files in 1 directory. \nI would use the database. If you want to cache it for a website have a look at \"solr\" (\"providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying\").\n\nA: A binary search can easily handle millions of records so searching the single directory would not be a problem. It will do so very fast.\nBasically if you are using a 32 bit system, binary search upto 2Gb records is easy and good.\nBerekely DB, an open source software, would readily allow you to store the full result under one entry and would have the search built in.\n\nA: It depends on what you want to do with those 10 million files. If you don't need anything to perform a \"list\" or \"browse\" like action on the holding directory, but only access individual files by their names, and can predict their names unambiguously, I don't see any problem storing this many files in the same directory.\nOn the other hand, keep it in mind that most UIs and shells are not designed to handle this situation efficiently so you'd know not to use rm * but rather ls | xargs rm to delete everything here.\nNote that the number of inodes in a Unix-style file system (e.g. ext4) is not directly relevant to the choice of having a flat or hierarchical directory structure, because no matter in which directory you put the file it will occupy inodes. And actually deeper directory structure has higher overhead on inode consumption. (So IMO the accepted answer misleadingly mentioned inode limit which didn't support that argument.)\n", "Q: Can not install Ubuntu virutal machines on VirtualBox and VMware Player I have tried several times in several days to install Ubuntu (from 12.04 to 14.04 versions) on VirtualBox, but in vail.

In case the installer wants to download files it will stall in case it could not connect. When installing on bare metal the Ubuntu live session will already have drivers for most network adapters including wireless adapters to be able to connect.\nThis is different when installing in virtual machines, as these will make use of the host network for conntecting to the Internet. Therefore we will have to tell the virtual machine application to what network it should connect before we install Ubuntu.

Any ideas please?\n\nA: The most easy thing to check if your system knows your webcam are command lsusb, ls -l /dev/video* and hwinfo --usb.\nYou should be in the user-group video for most applications.\nYou should try to start VLC by command to open your webcam to see that VLC can use it direct from start: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam#VLC\nIn your C code example at the beginning of main there is the webcam device file \"/dev/video0\". You can test this by the VLC-commands above.\nSome more info: http://www.linuxintro.org/wiki/Set_up_a_Webcam_with_Linux\nThere is the file command: man 1 file. What does this tells you about the output file? Maybe this output from your libv4l-example is really garbage. I dont understand your question what does your libv4l-C-code-example has to do with vlc. It seems to me your example is grabbing RAW video data to the output.

With Windows the kernel code is the same. You can install an antivirus if you want for added security.  There are many FREE antivirus programs out there for Linux. Just be careful about the websites you go to. I have been using Linux, in multiple distributions, for years without an antivirus program and I have yet to get a virus of any kind. \n\nA: \nWhy I need to use anti virus like clam-av clam-tk or commodo antivirus in Ubuntu \n\nYou do not. Anything with Ubuntu is optional. The only reason to install the software you mention is when your Ubuntu is the system in a network where software and  mails are sent to Windows machines. So for normal desktop users there is no need whatsoever.\n\nCan those virus written for windows affect ubuntu OS files? \n\nYes. But they need to be specifically created to target Ubuntu through WINE. There are curently zero examples of this type of virus. And even then you probably will need to provide your admin password at a moment where you did not expect it to be asked. Anything related to WINE is dubious anyways. I myself would always use something like vBox to use Windows software; or a dual boot. \n\nWhy it is said that Linux platform is virus free ?\n\nBecause there has not been anyone that was able to create a virus that by itself is capable to create havoc amongst Linux systems. Linux was set up from the beginning to be multi-user. That also enforced that the creators had to come up with a concept that allows to prevent random users to do random things across the system. We Linux users have always been using an admin account (be it root or an admin with sudo) and separate user accounts. A pretty good show stopper for someone that is interested in affecting a lot of systems in the shortest amount of time without needing manual inteference.\nIn that respect: Windows is a lot easier target and Windows users have a lot less knowledge about computers and it uses. \n\nCompanies like symantec are making application like Norton anti virus for android which is again also Linux based platform.\n\nHave a look around the web and you will see that the people claiming you need anti-virus are mostly the anti-virus people. Example. If you stick to the intended places where you can get apps an anti-virus is a waste of resources. Now if you mess with your hardware and install 3rd party software from dubious sites you are on your own. \n", "Q: Open VPN connection doesnt work after reboot Ubuntu 14.04 First I like to thank anyone who is giving these great answer here !

I had hard time with BIOS and get machine boot from USB and finally boot to Ubuntu. Thats why I found this website and found fix to it.\nI think my machine is pretty much ready to go. I have followed lots of videos and articles such as \"top 5/10 things to do after installing Ubuntu\". So I have done all updates and tweaks through command line.\nI have premium plus account for CyberGhost VPN service so I wanted to install OpenVPN to my new fresh Linux machine.

Wirelesss indicator was not even trying to connect.I tried another reboot and checked setting but all was as they should be. Its not connecting. I dont know how to check any error logs etc. even if do, it wont help me much...\nI though something went wrong during installation so I thought I could do fresh install of OS and update everything just to practice and get more comfortable with Ubuntu. When everything was back to square one I started install VPN again.\nThis time following previous link from youtube and cyberghost own install guide https://support.cyberghostvpn.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/395/0/configure-openvpn-for-linux-mint\nLike said my first attemp was using OpenVPN UDP .ovpn with you youtube provide settings and it worked fine until reboot.\nAfter fresh OS installation i made VPN with TCP .ovnp and provide setting from cyberghost link. And for my bit suprice new TCP vpn connection work after clicking it !! All was fine like after first vpn installation but... after reboot it wont connect again. After two weeks with Ubuntu experience I have no tools to troubleshoot this. Hours of searching answers from forums im more confused. I have no other option to post my question and hope someone would find time to write step by step instruction get this thing work and hopefully someone who has same problem founds it too.\nok, i dont know what im doing here but i was able to find a command how to look log files.

Any ideas what's wrong?\n\nA: There are multiple mistakes here:\n1) Arrays should not be iterated like this:\nfor(i in ['...','...'])\n\nWhen you do that, i will be the index into the array, not the item in the array.  And, it will be iterating through properties of the object which can sometime be more than just array elements.  You should iterate array elements with either:\nfor (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    // process array[i]\n}\n\nor with .forEach():\narray.forEach(function(item, index) {\n    // process item here\n});\n\n2) I don't know the FB api myself, but I don't see any documentation that FB.api() returns a promise.  $.when() only works with promises.\n3) When you are accumulating items in friendsRequest, you are building an object, not an array.  Assuming friend.id is a string, friendsRequest[friend.id] sets the property of an object, not an array element.\n4) If you want to use an actual array with $.when() (after you fixed other things to actually have an array), $.when() expects to be called like this:\n$.when(p1, p2, p3, p4)\n\nwhere p1 ... p4 are promises.  So, if you have an array of promises, then you can call $.when() in the appropriate way by doing this:\n$.when.apply($, arrayOfPromises)\n\n", "Q: Accidentally formatted data.

After fresh install I installed property Nvidia driver(nvidia-331) from software sources and had no problem using it with Nvidia Prime feature. Then I wanted to update my driver to Nvidia 340. I just added xorg-edgers ppa to my software sources then after a short time Software Updater told me that updates was available(around 100 mb). I updated, rebooted and changed my GPU to Nvidia using Prime. After logout/login I had nothing on my screen. But the weird part is, my computer works! I can hear system sounds, I can open a terminal and enter commands; but I just can't see what I am doing. Whenever I switch back to Intel HD Graphics and reboot, I get my display back. I tried to install Nvidia 340 via software center(it was still 331 at that time), now I have version 340 but I still have the same problem. I tried xkill xinit startx etc from tty1 but nothing seems to work. I still have no display on discrete Nvidia card. I don't know what to do can anyone help me out?\nSorry for my bad English.\nUpdate:\nI successfully returned my drivers to their last working state(Nvidia 331 with Prime, tried both cards and they work). I just used ppa-purge to purge xorg-edgers ppa and it downgraded the packages I installed from this ppa. Here is the command I used:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge && sudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nSource: http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/11/install-nvidia-driver-346-16-beta/\nNow I can use Nvidia 331 property drivers but I'm still searching for ways to install Nvidia 340 drivers successfully. I'll update this post again if I find a way to do it.\nUpdate 2:\nOK, I found a way to install and use newest Nvidia 346 drivers with Nvidia Prime. It seems that the problem is not caused by driver. Something else in the xorg-edgers ppa causes this problem but I don't know what it is.\nCaution: I'm no expert, I'm just trying things out. I don't know if this will mess my system up in future. Try this if you know what you are doing or warn me if I am doing something wrong.\nHere is what I did:\nAdd xorg-edgers ppa to software sources:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall driver from ppa:\n\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346 nvidia-settings\n\nSource: again http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/11/install-nvidia-driver-346-16-beta/\nAnd then, I opened Ubuntu Software Center > Edit > Software Sources > Other Software and unchecked the http://ppa.launchpad.net/xorg-edgers/ppa/ubuntu entry. Thus it will not install any other packages from this ppa. Now I can use Nvidia 346 drivers with prime and have no problems yet.\n\nA: That's the black screen issue with nvidia-prime, xorg, wayland and the heavy work on these topics during the last year(s).\nThe most recent cause of that problem is explained herein:\n\n\n*\n\n*Black screen when in nvidia mode after updating to kernel 3.13.0-45 See the answer from Charl Botha, Feb 2 at 22:15\nThis one is an extremely annoying bug.\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb: You always should switch to a virtual console Ctrl + Alt + F1 and back to your X-console Ctrl + Alt + F7 (or F8). This will work in many cases. Ater the solution from above I had to do so (once again).\nThis error has many reasons but most of them are due to corrupt xorg.conf file or bad dkms modules/drivers. Another good point to start with is Ctrl + Alt + F1; sudo service lightdm stop; sudo prime-switch intel; sudo service lightdm start; Ctrl + Alt + F7 and once on desktop window start the gksudo/kdesudo nvidia-settings and save it without clicking anywhere, just quit with saving, reboot an hope.\nThere are many older (before 2015) solutions to similar problems. All together they relay on the black screen when using nvidia after the boot splashscreen immediately on login screen or after login.\n\nA: OK, I found a way to install and use newest Nvidia 346 drivers with Nvidia Prime.

From that point of view, it would be undesirable behavior as well; the mouse would either make a weird jump down, or disappear to nowhere, and be invisible unless you move it down. \nThe first option would be inconsistent behavior in combination with possible windows, spread over two screens, the disadvantage of second option needs no further explanation I guess.\nHowever\nLike everything in computer life, it can be scripted, but again, I would not want that, for the reasons above.\nEdit\nFrom your comments, I understand that you feel the mouse should (on transition) move to a vertical position, relatively equal to the position on the screen it came from. That is exactly the misunderstanding, since windows (and anything else on the desktop) have an absolute size and position (in px). Windows can even be spread over two screens. You can not combine those two and have a consistent desktop.\n", "Q: How to add FTP and SSH acces to Ubuntu? Day2 of my Ubuntu Desktop experience:\nGot a simpleNodeJS page (Hello World) page working and i even could reach it via my home-network. Now I want to add FTP and SSH access, because this Ubuntu pc need to function as a NodeJS testserver, before i will rent a dedicated server. So i need to develope and excercise my SSH skills.\nI have searched in the software centre but could not find it. I suppose i need to do something like \napt-get SSH/FTP\nBut i do not understand what exactly to do, when it isn't found there?\nMay thanks in advance for any help!\n\nA: sudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nI prefer scp over ftp\n\nA: Using Ubuntu Software Center\nSearch for openssh-server in software center. Server related programs may not be shown in default search results in the Software Center. You may have to make sure that technical results are visible in the search. There should be a link at the bottom of the Software Center window with the words \"Show nnn technical items,\" where nnn is a number.\nUsing the Command line\nOpen a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nUnlike the GUI, the password prompt won't show anything like **** when you type the password. This is normal.\nThe two methods of installing software in Ubuntu do exactly the same thing. A lot of people write command line methods in answers because they are easy to copy and paste in the terminal and easy to describe. The server installation does not have the desktop, so only command line works for both type of installation.\nFor FTP server:\nI recommend using sftp. This is more secure than ftp and is part of ssh. So you won't need another server. Another advantage of sftp is, if you setup private/public key based login for ssh, the same system will work for sftp.\nOtherwise there are many ftp servers you can choose from. I think making sure the \"technical results\" are visible will show them if you type ftp. \nsee Basic Ubuntu FTP Server and How do I install a FTP Server? for various other ftp servers.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Please refer to:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH\n\n*Ubuntu LTS Server guide on FTP\n\n*http://www.wikihow.com/Set-up-an-FTP-Server-in-Ubuntu-Linux\n", "Q: Terminal color scheme not working How can I reset gnome-terminal color scheme? My terminal not showing color difference when I use ls command. All files and directories shown in white. It's difficult to see which one is directory and which one is file. I don't know what exactly cause this problem. The problem comes from my linux installation before. For details what I have done that causes this problem is:\n\n\n*\n\n*I install arch linux system.\n\n*I delete home partition and create a new one. There, gnome-terminal color scheme is not working for the first time.\n\n*I install Ubuntu with that arch home partition that I used before without formatting it. I think the settings carried on.\n\n*Then gnome-terminal color scheme have the same problem from the previous arch system.\n\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: When you deleted your home partition, you may have removed the alias for ls that's configured by default, and which would be in ~/.bashrc. Since you kept the same home directory when installing Ubuntu, this theory explains what you are experiencing.\nTo test whether this is the case, use\nls --color=auto\n\nIf this works correctly, you need to restore the default aliases and some other things, for this I suggest you just copy /etc/skel/.bashrc into your home directory (be careful if you've customized the .bashrc in your home dir).\nThis also depends on the coreutils package (for the dircolors utility), but that's installed in every ubuntu system so I'm pretty sure you're not missing that package.\n\nA: You need to copy the file /etc/skel/.bashrc into your home directory.\nThen you also have to run source ~/.bashrc or launch a new shell to use the changes.\nThis worked on 16.04.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.01 corrupted I installed 14.04.01 on a Macbook Pro purchased in 2009.

I have three Linux systems all Ubuntu based and two of them are using Firefox 35 (Xfce Linux Mint Qiana and Ubuntu Unity 14.04) while the third, Kubuntu 15.04 development branch (with the new Plasma 5) has Firefox 34. When I try to follow the normal method  to update Firefox to the latest version the program acts as if no update is available. The system also shows the notice \"up to date\".\nIn Synaptic there is no option to upgrade Firefox. (I will not mention Muon here, if has big problems in this unstable version.)\nGoing to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/plugincheck/ I see the message \"Looks like you’re using an older version of Firefox.\" and I get to download firefox-35.0.1.tar.bz2. But I do not want to use the archived/portable version.\nHow to get to the latest version as usual?\n\nA: The Update Firefox thing only works if you download Firefox from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/ and use that, as if Firefox is installed using the package manager by default it is only accessible by root (I think the updater works in Windowz due to a background running service/security flaws) - hence the note at the top of the article:\n\n\"Note: If you use your Linux distribution's packaged version of\n  Firefox, you will need to wait for an updated package to be released\n  to its package repository. This article only applies if you installed\n  Firefox manually (without using your distribution's package manager).\"\n\nA solution that uses a package manager would be to download the closest available packages (for 14.10) from http://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic-updates/firefox , along with needed dependencies and install those (using gdebi might help with that).\nIf that fails, just manually install from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/: extract it somewhere out of the way, and set it as default/use a wrapper script/use a soft link from where the existing Firefox binaryis.\n15.04 is not due to be released until April 23rd, and the devs behind probably are busy doing the updates to the system rather than external packages like Firefox.\n", "Q: Landscape fails

Essentially, you're just boosting your processing power - VRAM bandwidth is the same as the VRAM on the lowest GPU.\nIn your case, since the second GPU has only 512MB (AFAIK), your 1st GPU is still running at its normal speed, but it has lost 768MB of memory bandwidth to work with and thus the second GPU is bottlenecking your system.\nMy best guess as to why the second (Radeon HD 3450) doesn't lag is that it was made to run with 512MB of RAM, whereas the first GPU was made to run with 1GB of RAM.\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not boot, boot-repair not working I find myself in dire need of your help. My laptop boots into Grub fine, but then it gets stuck on the spash screen. The splash screen does keep going, but I left it for more than 30 minutes without touching it at once to no avail before giving up and force shutdown.\nI have then proceeded to boot into my Utopic liveusb, install and run boot-repair, which didn't solve the problem but it did give me a notice that there was an error in the procedure. However I don't have the knowledge necessary to make sense of the log it gave me: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10179211/\nI really one of you will understand something there and know how to fix it... Anyway, a bit more context:\nMy laptop is an Asus UX301, it has been running Ubuntu (13.10, then 14.04 and now 14.10) more than fine for about a year now, I hadn't had any issue (not even slight ones) for months until now, what led to the state it is now seems to have happened after I closed the lid to suspend the computer, only to find it heated up a few hours later and unresponsive, forcing me to force shutdown and to find it not booting up after letting it cool for a few minutes.\nThe laptop is running two 256 gigs Sandisk SSDs in Raid0, which has me scared that one of them has had a failure and killed the array. However, I'm no expert (not at all), but when I booted up the LiveUSB and got into gparted, it did recognize the Raid array and its filesystems and both drives individually, as well as what seems like the right proportion of used/unused space on the array, which makes me hopeful that the drives are both fine-ish at least. I may be completely delusional, not knowledgeable enough to make such assumptions...\nSo yeah, here's to hoping one of you has the answer to my issue. If you think the drives are OK, but the system is lost, I would appreciate it if you let me know of a way to access the array and salvage what unbacked-up data I had lying around before reinstalling.\nThanks in advance for your answers !\nPS: If you need any further information to help, I'll try and provide it as fast as possible.\nEdit: Little update, I have managed to access my root partition from the LiveUSB (it was sitting in Nautilus and I just didn't notice it before) and all the data on it, so backing up the files I need from the home partition will be no problem if it is needed. Also mostly confirms that the array isn't corrupted, which means no drive has failed.\nIt's just a question of whether or not the system per se is fixable or if reinstalling is my only option. \n\nA: Seems like you are repairing the boot loader on the USB disk.

When I did this, I got the output form -v from scp.  What was happening was, scp was running ssh, but was not passing my identity file -i command, so it was getting access denied, because the effective user id was root, and root had no key on the remote machine for my user account on that machine for ssh to use.\nI went through the steps for setting up password-less login, but locally as root, to my remote normal user account.\nSo, my remote login (non-root) had both keys for my local normal user account and the local root account, after that, it started working.\nThe process is now working perfectly using scp as a server service.  scp not passing the -i option to ssh is what caused this mess.\nHopefully this helps anyone trying to use scp form cron or other server service type script.\n", "Q: How can I change the default Nautilus Bookmarks?

How do I stop it for creating such folders...\neg..if I open the application say - Stellarium, then\nin the home - a folder \".Stellarium\" gets created\nThis was not being created before...What can do to prevent such folders on being created. I am using Ubuntu 13.10 since 2 years.\n\nA: Those folders definitely were created before, but you probably hit Ctrl+H accidentally (the key combination to toggle visibility of folders and files with a name starting with a dot), so you can see them now.\nWhat these folders are for\nUsually applications store all kinds of (user specific-) settings & configuration files, profiles etc. in these hidden folders. In general, you can remove them safely, but then possibly changed settings, stored in such folders, will be lost. Also: on the next run, they simply will be re- created.\nBe careful\nDeleting these folders can however have bigger consequences: if you delete e.g. the folder .thunderbird, all your mail wil be lost.\nPossible reasons to remove these directories\n\n*\n\n*Not really your question, but related: many times in case an application starts acting weird or with errors, removing (or temporarily renaming-) this folder is the first thing you would like to try, to force the application to recreate its settings file(s).\n\n*Sometimes settings files of newer application versions are incompatible with older settings files. If you install a newer version of an application (e.g. when you upgrade your Ubuntu version), remaining outdated settings files can act up.\n\n*If you have application settings of applications you don't use anymore.\n\n\nA: This folder contains your settings and preferences for that particular application. You can delete it if you really want, but the application will start with default settings. \nIf you are seeing these folders and don't want to, you have probably selected Show Hidden Folders. Try pressing CTRL +H to toggle this. \n", "Q: unresolved host / Upgrade 12 to 14 Ubuntu/ Net Connection fine through browser I recently upgraded to 'Trusty' i.e. Ubuntu 14.04.

Now I can't seem to allocate it to the Ubuntu partition. Neither partition show the possibility of being moved and I understand the unallocated one must be to the right of the extended Ubuntu partition.\n\nA: Are you using the ubuntu partition right now? You cant modify a mounted partition. You have to boot up with a live environment, e.g. Ubuntu from a USB stick to modify the partition.\n\nA: Simply freeing up space in windows partition will not give you extra space in ubuntu partition.The space you have freed is currently not utilized by either ubuntu or windows.\nWhat you have to do now, is increase the size of Ubuntu partition to add that un-utilized space into the Ubuntu partition.\nBut, as @owang pointed out, you cannot modify a mounted partition.i.e You cannot expand(or shrink) your partition while using it.You have two options:\n1.Boot using an Ubuntu USB stick into live environment to modify the partition(i.e use gparted from live environment), or\n2.Boot into windows and use gparted like software alternatives available for Windows(try EaseUS Partition Master or Parted magic)\n", "Q: App is accessible through Unity Launcher but can't access through terminal I had installed Sublime Text 3 a few months back, and using some online resource I had made it accessible through Unity Launcher(unfortunately, I don't remember which resource, or how I did it).\nSo, currently I can only open Sublime Text using launcher and to open a new file I have to use the menu(or Control+N).\nI want to be able to open a file in sublime text using terminal.i.e something like:sublime_text newfile.txt.\nSteps I took:\n1.....\nI searched and found that SublimeText folder(and the script) was in /opt directory.So I wrote a 2 line script to point to the script and run it, and then wrote an an alias called Sublime_Text to run that script and put it in the .bashrc file.\nSo now I can write Sublime_Text and it opens the sublime_text3 editor, but command like Sublime_Text newfile.txt does not give me a new file(only opens sublime_text and no newfile)\n2.....\nI tried to copy the sublime_text script originally in the /opt/sublime_text folder into /usr/bin/ directory (since vim, vi and other terminal commands are kept in that folder).

For example, add a line like\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/sublime_text\n\nto your ~/.bashrc file. You will need to log out and back in for the change to take effect, or re-source the file in your current shell e.g.\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\n*create a symbolic link from the executable file to somewhere that's already on your PATH e.g.\nsudo ln -s /opt/sublime_text /usr/local/bin/sublime_text\n\nYou will need to remove the copy of the script that you placed in /usr/bin so that the system doesn't find it first.\n\nA: You can launch Sublime Text 3 using subl or subl file in the terminal.\n", "Q: SSH to host#1 and then ssh to host#2 from host#1 and then run command and then stay connected Im trying to SSH to host #1, who has access to host #2, \nand on host #2 I want to run a command.

According to the bug comments, the kidle_inject processes are spawned to throttle processor and protect it from further overheating. \nBefore \"fixing\" the bug, make sure your fan is clean and works correctly. I had this problem and found out that the vent was full of dust. After cleaning and reboot no kidle_inject was spawned anymore.\n\nA: I noticed this today as well. Oddly enough for the kind of CPU usage, the fan wasn't making any noise. Managed to reboot the machine and then looked at BIOS Fan speed. It showed that the fan had stopped (no RPM reading). So after a bit of a cleaning (quite literally - opening the laptop lid, cleaning a bit, the fan started working fine and things got alright. So might be the problem is with your CPU fan. So simply disabling the intel_powerclamp may not be a good idea.  \n\nA: I did the following steps which worked.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if the module is loaded. \nlsmod |grep -i intel_powerclamp\n\n\n*If the previous command shows that the module is loaded, perform the next lines.  \n\n*Add the following line in your crontab rules @reboot /sbin/rmmod intel_powerclamp or echo '/sbin/rmmod intel_powerclamp' >> /etc/bash.bashrc (it will affect all users) or echo 'blacklist intel_powerclamp' > /etc/modprobe.d/disable_mods.conf.  \n\nA: A good cleaning around the laptop (HP EliteBook 8460p running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) and a vacuuming of the air vents on both sides (along with moving the piles of random stuff that had accumulated there) fixed it for me.\n\nA: This is not a bug, it's a feature.\nThe CPU first heats.\nThen kidle-inject blocks each thread (that is 8 procs per 4 cores) around 50% of its time - NOT consuming power, not heating, but slowing down the system.\nSolution:\nVacuum the vent slids.\nKeep them open (e.g. do not work in bed with the bottom of the notebook \"choked\" by the cushions.\nCool your apartment down (wait for the night to do CPU-intensive tasks).\n", "Q: How to run libreoffice via ssh with x11-forwarding I am trying to launch loffice or localc via an established ssh connection (ForwardX11 enabled).

The first time it listed about 12 or more items which i manually installed.  \nNow I only get this message.  \n\nI don't have unity back yet, but I was able to load Lubuntu-desktop, xubuntu-desktop and gnome.  So at least I can get around now.  However, gnome core has the same problem as unity. \nI am still looking for an answer.  \nThank you\n\nA: run this commands\nsudo apt-get clean    \nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n", "Q: How to prevent Audacious to control overall system sound?

Please make sure you are connected to the internet by ethernet or any other means. Open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall firmware-b43-installer\n\nIt takes a few moments, so please be patient. When it finishes, check:\nls /lib/firmware/b43\n\nYou should see dozens of firmware files. If so, you should be set. Reboot and tell us the result.\nIf reboot is not feasible, then:\nsudo modprobe -r b43  <---if it says it's not loaded, that's fine, just continue\nsudo modprobe -r ssb_hcd\nsudo modprobe -r ssb  <---if it says in use, see lsmod for users\nsudo modprobe b43\n\nYour wireless should be working.\nThis device works quite well in Ubuntu once the proprietary firmware is installed. \n", "Q: Do Phones running Ubuntu Touch have remote ability to remove apps, wipe phone - aka killswitch? Android (when using google services) and iPhones have the ability to remove apps (used for removing malicious and expired apps) and also remotely wipe/disable the phone (in event of theft).\nDo phones running Ubuntu Touch have these features ?\n\nA: No, but you can already do this with Prey regardless of the device (phone, tablet). It has an Ubuntu installer. \nBesides that ... on the development mailing list there is a proposal ...\n\nSo i came to me the idea of some cloud service like (android device manager) to handle this issue. The app must be delivered by default and should be registered with the user account email at first time phone setup. This will be register the user email into the cloud service with the phone or device imei and one imei can only have one user email acount (owner) entry, so the real first owner of the device will have the power of track, and manage the device online.\n\n... that got positive feedback.\nNotable comment on this ...\n\nThe system has support for click packages which cannot be removed by\n  the user. However, if the phone is plugged in to USB and the Android\n  development tools are used, then the device can be wiped completely\n  clean, from underneath the OS. There's nothing we can do about that in\n  the OS itself right now, and any anti-theft support at that low level\n  would have to be implemented by the hardware vendors, not necessarily\n  as part of the Ubuntu OS that runs on the device.\n\n", "Q: Repair broken encrypted home I've ran into following problem.

I just want to access my data and ssh keys. \nUbuntu version is 14.04.\nMany thanks in advance.\nCheers\n\nA: An encrypted home (using eCryptFS) is different from an encrypted partition (using cryptsetup / LUKS). The fact that you can mount your /home partition and \"see the contents of the drive\" also tells you it's not an entirely encrypted device (so not cryptsetup/LUKS).\nTo view your encrypted home files now, you should be able to run:\n\necryptfs-recover-private - find and mount any encrypted private directories\n\nJust running it without any directory specified should cause it to \"search the entire system for encrypted private directories\", see it's man page for info. (Actually, in a terminal, typing ecryptfs and then TAB a few times should display the list of possible commands, you might've saw the \"recover\" and thought it could be useful.)\nAnd you're probably not seeing all the files, the actual encrypted files are probably in /home/.ecryptfs/<user>/.Private/, and the eCryptfs config directory /home/.ecryptfs/<user>/.ecryptfs/. If you wanted to back up everything you can see in your /home partition now, you should be able to decrypt it all later too (if you don't forget to copy the important wrapped-passphrase file).\n\nI don't know what the \"broken files\" are, or how you ran a \"disk check\" or what errors it gave, but a standard filesystem check in a terminal would be running the fsck program, or if you know the filesystem you can run fsck.<type>, maybe fsck.ext3 (that one's actually a link to the e2fsck program). See the man page for your /home's specific filesystem (mount should tell you, if it's mounted, or if not then parted -l or fdisk -l or the \"Disks\" or gparted programs)\nIf your drive were failing, or if the filesystem was just corrupted somehow (power failure?) they could give similar errors, but that's just guesses. If it were a failing drive, it would probably keep getting worse, and if you wanted to mount the partition as read-only (mount -o ro...) you might be able to read all the data you can now, before it gets any worse. But again, that's just being extra cautious and paranoid about your very vague \"broken files\" error.\n", "Q: How to add a PPA which does not include my Ubuntu distribution?

I did not replace the Windows 8 that I was previously using. While ubuntu has by and large been working very well, one issue is that grub does not load when I restart my computer. If I want to switch operating systems, I have to restart my computer and then go into the BIOS and switch the boot mode from CSM to UEFI (or vice-versa). \nWhile it is not the end of the world to have to do this, it would be more convenient for me to have grub. Also, I am planning to install another Linux distro in the near feature, and without grub working I am worried that I won't be able to switch between my Linux distros. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions for getting grub to work?\n\nA: If you follow this, unfortunately german instructions, it might work.\nSo first you have to install some packages, namely linux-signed-generic  grub-efi-amd64-signed  shim-signed. This will install the signed kernel, your old kernel will be kept and works as a fallback if you boot with EFI disabled.\nAfter that, update grub by running sudo grub-install --uefi-secure-boot. If you get an error message, run it with sudo grub-install --uefi-secure-boot --force.\nAfter that, your system should boot in both BIOS modes. Please not that installing a new kernel while the system is booted in CSM or legacy mode, the relevant package linux-signed-generic will be removed and you have to repeat the steps above.\n\nA: I had a lot of problems when I installed Ubuntu on my lap(the UEFI mode was on). Someone told me to uninstall Ubuntu and reinstall it after disabling UEFI. Needless to say that sure did work. You said you installed it before one month, I believe the problem didn't came to exist just now. If there is still time for reinstall try that one too.\n\nA: I dont know if this will help but have you tryed using the disk to repair grub?\nI'm sorry if this sounds basic but this has helped me with a problem sorta similar\n\nA: You can boot Ubuntu only in UEFI because you have installed Ubuntu in UEFI mode while Your windows installation is in Legacy (Not EFI) Mode. \nTo Avoid Such issues you need to Install Ubuntu in UEFI mode only if Windows is installed in UEFI mode or Ubuntu is the only operating system on your computer. If your windows is installed in Legacy mode, then you must install Ubuntu in Legacy mode.\nTo solve this issue you need to convert Ubuntu from UEFI mode to Legacy mode. \nPlease follow below instructions to do it. \n1) Start Boot-Repair, click on Advanced options, go to the  GRUB location tab.\n2) Untick the Separate /boot/efi partition option & Click the Apply button.\n\n3) Set up your BIOS so that it boots the HDD in Legacy mode\nThat's it. \n", "Q: Setting gnome as desktop environment in .xsession Allow me to explain:\nIn my new workplace, each user can log in from any pc and the complete home folder is loaded to that machine from server.

I have recently uninstalled ubuntu-web-browser from my ubuntu 14.04 using synaptic package manager as I don't use it. Now I can't start vlc media player nor play any file using vlc. It sort of opens and then immediately closes down automatically. I get this when I try opening vlc in the terminal:\nVLC media player 2.1.4 Rincewind (revision 2.1.4-0-g2a072be)\n[0x8f6d910] main libvlc: Running vlc with the default interface.

VLC media player\n2.1.4 Rincewind\nCommand Line Interface initialized. Type `help' for help.\n\nI have installed ubuntu anew twice because of this vlc problem. But only this time I realised it was due to uninstallation of ubuntu-web-browser that vlc stops working. I know this because I tested that vlc runs before I uninstalled the mines and the other games and then ubuntu browser. But after uninstalling these, vlc won't start. So I suspect uninstalling these is the cause.\nNow my question is if vlc depended on some packages that were uninstalled due to uninstallation of some other stuff, then why would those packages be removed even when vlc had dependency on them? (am I wrong, or missing something?) How are the dependencies maintained during uninstallation? Also, how can I get vlc running without installing ubuntu again?\nNew absurd observation:\nI uninstalled the games in ubuntu using the following command found here\nsudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-mahjongg gnomine gnome-sudoku aisleriot\n\nand same problem occurs !!! Vlc stopped working, and same error message in terminal!\nAnyone knows what the problem is, and how to solve it?\nYet another absurd observation\nThis time I uninstalled the games using apt-get remove, but vlc keeps working. Then unity-tweak-tool gives error message while starting. This was solved by installing unity-webapps-service as said here. Then vlc stops working, giving that message again!\n\nA: You asked,\n\nNow my question is if vlc depended on some packages that were uninstalled due to uninstallation of some other stuff, then why would those packages be removed even when vlc had dependency on them?\n\nAnswer: No, apt package management system, which Ubuntu uses, doesn't remove a package upon which other packages depend, even if you want to uninstall some of them. That would be silly. For a typical example, consider package libc6. It's one of the core packages of Ubuntu and hence, lots of packages depend on It. But uninstalling one or two from them, won't remove libc6.\nMoreover, If you deliberately want to remove a package, upon which lots of packages depend, Ubuntu or specifically apt system will warn you before actual uninstall. But if you wish, you can uninstall that package too! In this case, the other packages which depend on this, also get removed.\nCase 1:\nLet, There be three packages named core-x, a and b. a and b both depend of core-x package. Now, if you try to remove package b, core-x will not be removed, since it is still needed for functioning of a.\nCase 2:\nAgain consider our fictitious packages. If you now try to remove core-x package by putting in apt-get remove line, core-x will get removed with both a and b package, because these two (a and b) won't function without core-x.\n\nYour second question was -\n\nhow can I get vlc running without installing ubuntu again?\n\nFor this, try removing vlc with purge option and re-install again.\nA command like below will do the job.\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove libvlc5\n\nand install it with\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nBonus: By using libvlc5 instead of plain vlc, you are just experiment with Case 2 where you removed a package, upon which other packages depend.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Vlc problem is solved when I did these:\n\n\n*\n\n*completely removed vlc\n\n*removed the driver of my ZTE modem (ZTE MF-193E) that uses qt plugins to run\n\n*installed vlc again; and vlc runs normally\n\n\nLater I installed the modem driver again, but this time vlc kept working! \n", "Q: How to replace package install of nginx with compiled from source?

You can then type clang++ and the according executable should be found.\nsudo apt-get install clang\n\n\nA: Adding to Yan Foto's answer (and just in case your aim is to get a usable clang but not necessarily use it as cc), you can actually add the entire set of programs in one go using\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/bin/clang-3.8 380 \\\n--slave /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-3.8 \\\n--slave /usr/bin/clang-check clang-check /usr/bin/clang-check-3.8 \\\n--slave /usr/bin/clang-query clang-query /usr/bin/clang-query-3.8 \\\n--slave /usr/bin/clang-rename clang-rename /usr/bin/clang-rename-3.8\n\n(Note that the set of binaries that come with each clang version might differ, e.g. 3.6 does have clang-tblgen, 3.8 doesn't.)\nIf you repeat this for every version of clang you install, you'll be able to switch between them using just a single update-alternatives command.\n(Meanwhile, apparently, there is still an ongoing debate about whether to include these links with Ubuntu packages or not: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/llvm-3.1/+bug/991493)\n\nA: It's there, but it's still called clang-3.5.\nYou can either execute it as clang-3.5 (or clang++-3.5) or setup a symlink to it like I did (installing regular clang didn't work):\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/clang-3.5 /usr/bin/clang\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/clang++-3.5 /usr/bin/clang++\n\nUgly work-around, perhaps; but at least it works for now :)\n\nA: This should set the update-alternatives for clang-4.0 if clang-3.8 (as on Ubuntu 16.04) is installed:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/bin/clang-4.0 100\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-4.0 100\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang-apply-replacements clang-apply-replacements /usr/bin/clang-apply-replacements-4.0 100\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang-check clang-check /usr/bin/clang-check-4.0 100\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang-query clang-query /usr/bin/clang-query-4.0 100\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang-tidy clang-tidy /usr/bin/clang-tidy-4.0 100\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/scan-build scan-build /usr/bin/scan-build-4.0 100\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/scan-view scan-view /usr/bin/scan-view-4.0 100\n\n\nA: The proper way to use clang as your default cc and c++ is to use update-alternatives:\n\nIt is possible for several programs fulfilling the same or similar functions to be installed on a single system at the same time. For example, many systems have several text editors installed at once. This gives choice to the users of a system, allowing each to use a different editor, if desired, but makes it difficult for a program to make a good choice of editor to invoke if the user has not specified a particular preference.\n\nso first you need to add clang-3.5 or clang++-3.5 as alternatives to e.g. gcc and g++:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/cc cc /usr/bin/clang-3.5 100\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/c++ c++ /usr/bin/clang++-3.5 100\n\nIf at any time you need to switch back to gcc or g++ you can use the --config option:\nsudo update-alternatives --config c++\n\n\nA: Create a .bashrc file in your home directory.

Then try to compile your program again.\nFrom what I can tell clang won't work unless you state the version in the command name \"clang++-3.5\". So I just aliased the name in my .bashrc file. So I only have to type \"clang++\".\nBy the way I downloaded clang 3.5, so adjust the previous advice to your version.\n\nA: If you have clang correctly installed, another very easy way to save you the trouble of typing the version number along with the name of the program is to use the auto-completion feature, for example (having clang++-3.5 installed):\nclang+[TAB][ENTER]\n\nSo you only have to type clang+, hit Tab and Enter. Works the same way with names of directories, file names, etc. (This won't help you, however, if you have more than one version of a program installed.)\n\nA: Adding to Johann Wendin's answer about symlinking. In a root-shell you can link all the various clang tools at once:\ne.g.\nfind /usr/bin/ -name clang*  | sed -E 's/^(\\/usr\\/bin\\/.*)(\\-[0-9]*)$/ln -s -v \\1\\2 \\1/' | xargs -d '\\n' -n 1 bash -c\n\nand then repeat for:\nllc-*\nlld-*\nlldb-*\nllvm-*\n\nThen everything should be linked, not just a small selection. (Maybe I still forgot something).\nThis will find all the files according to the pattern in /usr/bin, remove any trailing numbers (-8 or -9 or even -10), and then create symlinks on each.\n", "Q: Keyboard with Ubuntu Logo for less than $100?

Or just stop the service?\n\nA: This can be somewhat context sensitive, and I'll try to outline that here.\njuju destroy service does a few things. First it sends a command to the juju state server that every unit in this service group is to be destroyed. This then has a chain reaction into the following events:\n\n\n*\n\n*The state server signals to the service (charm) that it is going to be destroyed\n\n*The charm breaks any relationships to its service that are established which calls:\n\n\n*\n\n*relationship-broken\n\n*relationship-departed\n\n\n*The charm calls its own stop hook - and this is where it gets context sensitive.\nThe stop hook is typically responsible for a few concerns. \n\n\n*\n\n*Stopping the service\n\n*removing any responsible application files/configuration that were populated during the service lifecycle. \n\n*Preparing any backup(s) of the service that are required to restore (in a well formed charm)\n\n\nThe service is then removed from the juju topology, along with any units that made up that service group. \nThe resulting machine is tagged dirty so it's not reused for a new deployment and left in the environment for you, the orchestrator, to fetch any leftover data if you wish, and can then be terminated with:\njuju destroy-machine #\n\nThe # being the unit number of the machine.\n", "Q: Suggestions for Epson WF-1110 WiFi printer?

There is no specific WF-1110 driver in the current distro; the Epson WorkForce 1100 driver doesn't work (you'd think it would) and the recommended driver Epson WF-7018 Series - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.2.10 does the same blank-pages thing.\nI'm not totally sure it's a driver issue (you'd think the WF-1100 driver would do the trick), so I'm wondering if there are other tweaks I should try.\n\nA: I solved this, and figure others may benefit.

This might be a lame question but what is the difference between running an executable with ./an_executable and . an_executable (let's suppose that we are in the dir where an_executable is located)\nI already know that the former makes the shell look for an_executable in the current directory (.), but why isn't a / needed after . when using the latter version?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The . executable syntax doesn't work with just any executable (or does it?). Instead, it's an alias for the bash source built-in. So the difference is mostly relevant to bash scripts, and the truth is that they're completely different things :)\n./executable asks to run the executable \"normally\". ./ is a relative reference to the current path. This avoids having the shell (bash) try to locate the executable in a directory in its $PATH (which it would do if you didn't specify a path at all with the command). The reason why you can't just do executable is one of security; imagine you uncompress an archive you downloaded and it contains a malicious version of ls. If it ran directly from your current directory, you'd run that version without realizing.\nOn the other hand, . executable is saying \"source a file named executable\". Since you're directly naming the file and it really doesn't have to be an executable, the security restriction for the $PATH doesn't apply. Sourcing will only \"run\" (or seem to run) shell scripts. What it does is:\n   source filename [arguments]\n          Read and execute commands from filename  in  the  current  shell\n          environment  and return the exit status of the last command exe‐\n          cuted from filename.\n\nSo... What's really the difference between executing and sourcing? Assuming the same shell script, executing it (./script) will spawn a new shell, run the script inside that shell, and when the script exits, close that shell and return to the parent shell. In effect, it will start a new bash process to execute the script).\n(. script) will cause the current shell to read the commands from the file as if they were being typed in the command line. There's no new shell spawned.\nA very easy way to see how this behaves is to write a script that only contains exit. If you ./script it, nothing will seem to happen, this is because a new shell process is started, the exit command exits that new shell and your current shell is unaffected.\nIf you . script, you current terminal will close, because the exit command runs in the current shell. So it's equivalent to typing exit on the command prompt.\n", "Q: wifi worked until i rebooted EDIT: issue fixed, thanks for the help\nSo i'm pretty new to Ubuntu.\nI installed Ubuntu on my laptop a week ago (dual boot with win 8.1) and I think it's great.\nHowever i'm having a problem with my wifi.

I created a partition and installed Ubuntu on half of the drive.  Now I'm at a point where I rarely use Window, but I'm running out of space in the Ubuntu partition.  I can't delete Windows entirely, and I don't have to have to back up / re-install Ubuntu on a larger partition. Is there any way within Ubuntu that I can mount the Window partition, shrink it, and claim the newly freed space for the existing Ubuntu partition?\n\nA: You can use Gparted in Ubuntu. You will have to first unmount the windows partition since shrinking/expanding can be done only on unmounted partitions.\nUsing gparted, shrink the windows partition such that the amount of extra space you want for Ubuntu, is equal to the amount of unallocated space.\nRemember, this unallocated space is currently not utilized by wither windows or ubuntu.\nSo, now you need to expand the Ubuntu partition.\nBut, you cannot modify a mounted partition.i.e You cannot expand(or shrink) your Ubuntu partition while using it.So, you have two options:\n1.Boot using an Ubuntu USB stick into live environment to modify the partition(i.e use gparted from live environment), or\n2.Boot into windows and use gparted like software alternatives available for Windows(try EaseUS Partition Master or Parted magic)\n\nA: Yes.\nUse GParted to change partitions as mentioned in the related question Tim mentioned above. So first shrink the Windows partition (with it unmounted: you can't manage the partition while it's mounted) then claim the empty space for Ubuntu. There's at least two different ways you can claim the newly freed space for Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the partition that Ubuntu is on to the start of the empty space and then enlarge it to take up the new empty space at the end of the disk. Because this is the partition that Ubuntu is installed on, you won't be able to do this while running Ubuntu. Instead, you'll have to run a live CD with GParted included (ex. Ubuntu, PartedMagic, etc...). This will also introduce a boot problem because your Ubuntu install no longer exists where GRUB thinks it is. You should be able to fix this as documented by GParted: http://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=help-manual#gparted-fix-operating-system-boot-problems. Also with this approach, you'll definitely want to make sure you have a good backup of your entire Ubuntu install since if anything goes wrong (ex. loss of power), your Ubuntu partion could become messed up.\n\n*Create a new partition in the empty space, format it (ex. as ext4), and mount it in Ubuntu so that you can start using it. This approach doesn't require you to use a live CD (so technically the other approach doesn't meet the \"within Ubuntu\" criteria of the question). You might need to configure Ubuntu to automatically mount your new partition such as my creating an fstab entry.\nThe disadvantage of approach #2 is that the space on the new partition won't be useful for installing programs or doing other built-in OS things. It'll be a great place to store media, documents, etc... though.\n", "Q: Crontab once a weekday at startup Is that possible to run task once a week at startup?\nFor example:\non monday after reboot starts command 1 \non tuesday after reboot starts command 2 (but does not starts command1)\n\nA: You could use a single cron entry with @reboot, and use a script to select the command.

PdaNet+ contains both PdaNet and FoxFi.

I used in excess of 60 gigs a month without my bandwidth being limited as well. On LTE I was getting over 25 mbps.\nNote: PdaNet+ and FoxFi only works with android phones, but I see you're covered there.

If so, how? Wine for CDs? General compatibility? Would it be possible to get Terraria Collector's Edition working on Ubuntu 14.10? If so, how? Wine for CDs? General compatibility?\nI was wondering about getting my friend, (who has no internet access, so I have to do all this for him) a copy of Terraria Collector's Edition. I do not use Ubuntu, but I need to ask questions for him here.\nHow would I get it working on his computer? He's got Ubuntu 14.10.\nIs it already generally compatible? Or does it require the use of some form of Wine (the multi-platform program runner, of course) for CDs, or...?\n\nA: Regarding Terraria. Not specifically the collector's edition (but if that is a collection of several Terraria games)...\n\n\n*\n\n*Here is a how to on installing Terraria and using it directly in Ubuntu. Basic instructions (kudos to Deathmax):\nInstallation Instructions\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab the Content folder and Terraria.exe from Steam. (Either via wine or a Windows install) \n\n*Check the exe hashes at the bottom Extract the downloaded binaries archive  somewhere. \n\n*Run bspatch to patch Terraria.exe with the .patch file included in the archive. \n\n*Run mono Terraria.exe\n\n\nMusic Instructions\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have ffmpeg, python and perl installed.\n\n*Extract the music conversion archive into the Content folder.\n\n*Run perl xactxtract2.pl -x \"Wave Bank.xwb\"\n\n*Run convertmusic.sh\n\n*Run python MakeXwb.py \"Wave Bank.xwb\"\n\n*Make sure the file list outputted is in order.\n\n\nMusic should now work. (albeit with a 80MB Wave Bank with uncompressed PCM data)\n\n\nWhen using WINE ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Use WINE 1.7.8 and disable gameoverlayrenderer. You will see this mentioned on the wineHQ apps site and also that almost all versions of Terraria have a \"yes it runs\" with a gold rating.\n\n*You can find a Play on Linux script here if you want to do it yourself.\n\n*Here is a how to for Play on Linux (kudos to MadbriX|CVG):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Up PlayOnLinux and install your \"Terraria.exe\" with it. Click the button with the plus sign and says \"Install\" and a window should open up. In the\nlower left-hand side corner, there should be a button that says \"Install a non-listed program\". Follow the instructions (Be sure to create a \"New Virtual Drive\" when it asks). Navigate to where your Terraria.exe was saved to after download and press install. It will take a few minutes, but it's worth it ;)\nWhen Installation is finished, close the Install window and go back to the original main menu of PlayOnLinux.\n\n*Now, in the main menu, click on the Configure Button with the Gear Icon, and the \"Configure\" Window should open up.\n\n*In the Configure window, select \"Terraria\" in the side panel.\n\n*Click on the tab \"Install Components\". This is where you can see all the needed components for different Video Games.\n\n*Scroll down the list of components and at the bottom of the list, you should see \"xna40\". This is Microsoft XNA 4.0! Your Terraria won't recognize it if it was installed manually from the website for some strange reason.\n\n*Select the \"xna40\" and click Install. Once it has finished, select the tab called \"Miscellaneous\" can click on the button \"Run a .exe file from this virtual drive\"\n\n*The opening folder should show your recently used \"Terraria.exe\". Click on it, and wait around a few seconds for the game to initiate.\n\n*Enjoy the game!

For example, http://server rather than http://server.company.com. I have configured the search domain in the GUI Network Connections tool. I have also configured it in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head, but it is not working correctly.\nThe strange thing is certain tools like nslookup or host resolve to the correct IP, but other tools like ssh, ping, git, and web browsers do not.

The file head normally just contains the comment # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file... OVERWRITTEN.

When I installing .deb packages by hand I often encounter circular dependencies.\nI, then, install it with dpkg -i --force-depends ... and hope it works.\nHow does apt handle circular dependencies?\n\nA: Circular dependencies happen in the repositories, but the ones left standing obey some specific rules.\nUsually these are tightly bound packages (such as between g++-4.6 and libstdc++6-4.6-dev, or perl and perl-modules), so the Depends relationship between them specify the exact version number. For example, g++-4.6 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 depends on libstdc++6-4.6-dev (= 4.6.3-1ubuntu5), and libstdc++6-4.6-dev 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 on g++-4.6 (= 4.6.3-1ubuntu5). Such packages are always installed, upgraded or removed together. As to the algorithm that apt-get uses, I don't know, but you can read up on the aptitude algorithm on the aptitude creator's page.\n", "Q: Need to reinstall boot loader on Dell XPS 13 (9343) - no dual boot Being impatient and willing to wait until Dell comes up with their new version with ubuntu preloaded, I am trying to install 14.04.1 on my brand new XPS 13 (9343).\nI did few dry runs with a USB install key, found out how to work around the few kinks they still have (i.e., I got the network, and the mousepad working fine) and decided to go for the full installation.\nGiven that I do not care for Windows 8, I opted to nuke it out, and install only linux. No need for me to keep a dual boot at all. Thia apparently was a careless move, as after I completed a seemingly successfull installation, at the next reboot I get:\nNo bootable device found.\nPress F1 key to reboot.\nPress F2 key for setup utility\nPress F5 key to run onboard diagnostic.\n\nMy guts tell me that I inadvertently removed the Windows loader and did not get grub installed so at boot time it does not find any partition where to boot from.\nIf I re-use the USB key I can see the drive, and its data, but I cannot run it from the HD.\nHow do I get from here to have grub (or any valid boot loader) to work on these UEFI hard disks?\n\nA: You nuked a bit too much and deleted your UEFI partition as well: UEFI firmware does not reside in the BIOS any more, but on-disk!\nUse the Dell Recovery DVD to restore your system to a workable state, then follow this: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI then shrink Windows to the minimum+20% allowed size and delete it after you haven't booted to Windows for a month or so! ;-)\nOh, and have a look here as well on how to make system back-ups...\n\nA: I wound up having similar trouble. Follow these steps: http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/SLN297060/en\nAfter first reboot I had a boot profile suddenly :)\nWhy it works, I'm not sure. It does seem that  before install you turn on UEFI and secure boot etc.. The linux install does configures itself depending upon how it was booted, whether it should load via BIOS (legacy) or UEFI. But, the hardward is apparently only looking for one type, so it needs to be installed to match.\nI did also upgrade the firmware to A07. I don't think that was any different, but in case I'll mention it. (To upgrade to A07, download it from: http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=28M21, throw the .exe onto a USB stick, and hit F12 on boot during the Dell log, then update/flash firmware)\n\nA: You can just create an EFI partition via parted or similiar partition tools and stick your EFI boot files for Linux in there.\nYou aren't bound to the tiny 128MB default EFI partition Dell ships with their devices, I for one have a 512MB one created from which I boot my Arch Linux just fine.\nSo fret not, nuking the EFI partition isn't the end of all things.\n\nA: I have the Dell iso image for 14.04. Using this will get your device back to factory which includes the Dell Recovery. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Dell XPS 13 9343. In the end I went into the setup utility (by pressing F2) and under \"General -> Boot Sequence\" clicked \"Add Boot Option\", found grub and added it. \nInitially it still wouldn't boot because apparently the loader didn't have the correct certificates for SecureBoot, but I turned that off (under \"SecureBoot\" option) and it seemed to work.\nThis may for some reason be bad advice, in which case please let me know, but it worked for me.\n", "Q: Windows 7 partition D: to unallocated space? I'm trying to install Ubuntu, so I'm using Windows Disk Management to partition my D:\nAfter using Shrink Volume, the result is 50GB of \"free space\" attached to the D:. From what I've read I need unallocated space to install Ubuntu. So how do I get 50GB of \"unallocated space\"?\n\n\nA: Answer copied from comments:\nYour \"free space\" is allocated to an extended partition (that's why the whole thing is green), but within the extended partition, you can make logical partitions - and the free space space is currently not allocated to logical partitions (hence \"unallocated\"). \nUbuntu can and does work fine with extended partitions...\n", "Q: a problem with the hard drive has been detected hey i really need some help .this is what happened\nmy laptop fell(it was running windows 7) and the computer stopped working normally.i decided to connect it to my desktop(which already contained a hard disk) to try and recover the info.i thought since there was two hard disks that i had to use raid instead of ahci. i then changed it back to ahci when i released it was wrong .i detached my desktop hd and booted into live image .but i keep receiving the following text that flashes before the os starts:\n\n\"the following are warnigs that were detected during this boot. these\n  can be viewed in setup on the event log page \n  WARNING:A problem with the hard drive has been detected.\" \n\nafter i boot i can see the hard disk but i cant access it, i get get this message when i try to :\n\n\"Unable to mount location\nError mounting: mount exited with exit code 13:\n  ntfs-mst-post-read-fixup-warn:\nRecord 1 has no FILE magic oxffffffff)\nFailed to open inode $MFTMirr: Input/output error\nFailed to load $MFTMirr: Input/output error\nFailed to mount idev'sda3: Input/output error\nNTFs is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault or it's a\nSoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware.

Please see the 'dmraid documentation\nfor more details.\"\n\nplz be specific and detailed. thx\n\nA: This is an unfortunate mix of problems. You probably now have 2 sets of errors:\nDropping a running hard drive will potentially cause a hardware problem from the drop, + a soft error as the writing head drags across the platters\nAdditionally raid is going to have corrupted your partitions/files, on both drives - but the h/w error will only affect the laptop drive.\nI would suggest you concentrate initially on retrieving the desktop drive; check your partitions using parted --list. If the output looks sensible, run fsck on the partitions (you will likely find you have lost your partition structure though). This is really only recoverable if you know the original layout, or it's worth a try of creating one large partition (the whole disk) & just see if it was right..\nIf not then you will probably want a tool like foremost run from a live CD/USB and a spare (USB?) drive - this will recover files from a corrupted drive but loses the filenames.. You can run it over both drives, use fdupes to eliminate common files from both. You then get to play the media files, read the text files, renaming as you go.. Long job. You can reinstall your OS's once the files are recovered.\n", "Q: How do I check if my root password (login) is disabled? I accidentally enabled(set) my root password (by default it is locked), and now I want to \"undo\" it.\nI used both commands\nsudo usermod -p '!' root\n\nand\nsudo passwd -dl root\n\nin that order.\nHow do I check if root's account is locked?\n\nA: One possibility is to look into /etc/passwd by entering\ngrep root /etc/passwd\n\nIt should show a line starting like root:x: ...... where the x indicates that encrypted passwords are stored in the shadow file. If this is the case, we look into it by running \nsudo grep root /etc/shadow\n\n(shadow file needs sudo to be opened!) You should get a line beginning like the following as a result root:!: ...... where the ! or a * signalize that the account is disabled. Any other value (not beginning with ! or *) after root: would indicate a working password.\n\nA: You can use the passwd command:\n# passwd -S\nroot P 11/04/2014 -1 -1 -1 -1\n# passwd -l root\npasswd: password expiry information changed.\n# passwd -S \nroot L 11/04/2014 -1 -1 -1 -1\n# passwd -d root\npasswd: password expiry information changed.\n# passwd -S \nroot NP 11/04/2014 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\nFrom man 1 passwd:\n   -S, --status\n       Display account status information. The status information consists\n       of 7 fields. The first field is the user's login name. The second\n       field indicates if the user account has a locked password (L), has\n       no password (NP), or has a usable password (P). The third field\n       gives the date of the last password change. The next four fields\n       are the minimum age, maximum age, warning period, and inactivity\n       period for the password. These ages are expressed in days.\n\nThe data shown is stored in /etc/shadow, the file which holds the encrypted passwords.\nFor example, after each of the above passwd commands, the states were:\n1:root:$6$............long hash...............::::::\n1:root:!$6$........same long hash.............:16478::::::\n1:root::16478::::::\n\n\nA: By default when you install Ubuntu you should not know root password. It exists, but user should not know it. An admin, of course, could choose to alter the password with sudo passwd but generally it should not be necessary, unless you know what you're doing and why you're doing it. \nA file that contains information on all user passwords is /etc/shadow  and each entry in that file is encrypted. So unless an attacker gained access to your system and stole this file, he or she should not be able to enter root at all. There's always a possibility, of course, hence I suggest you disable any remote access features : telnet (not enabled by default ) , ssh, remote desktop, etc. Get yourself nmap tool and scan your system with sudo nmap localhost to see what ports may be open on your system. Also, get yourself a firewall; ubuntu comes with ufw firewall, which is simple to use and does the job well enough.\nAmong other methods, you could test root account with sudo -i\nIn the /etc/sudoers file , you should have a line like this : sudo -i. If you can't log in as root, you do not see the # as prompt, then the account is locked\nDefaults   env_reset,timestamp_timeout=30\ntimestamp_timeout will tell sudo to ask for password after 30 seconds again, so that you aren't logged in with root privileges all the time. It's one of the ways of securing your system.\nAn adverse side effect of changing root password is that if you forget password or another user on your system forgets the password, you won't have access to root. I'm not aware of any instances, but there's always possibility to mess up the system, because some of the processes run as root, and if you lock root account there is a possibility those might not work correctly or at all.\nI strongly recommend you read through man sudoers , man passwd,man shadow`. \nBest of luck and hope this helps !\n\nA: catch bleow one liner command for password report of all existed users in linux sever.\nfor i in $(cat /etc/passwd | awk -F ':' '{print $1}'); do echo \"##############\" \"$i\" \"############\";chage -l $i; echo \"##################################\"; done | nl | less\n\n\nA: Easy.\nHit Ctrl+Alt+F1. This will bring to a separate terminal. Try to login as root by typing root as your login and providing the password. \nIf the root account is enabled, the login will work. If the root account is disabled, the login will fail.\nTo get back to your GUI, hit Ctrl+Alt+F7.\n", "Q: Unable to disable ssh root login Unable to disable root login on Ubuntu 14.10\n\n\n*\n\n*login as root\n\n*vi /etc/ssh/ssh_config\n\n*PermitRootLogin line is not here so i add it\n\n*service ssh restart\n\n*root login still works. \n\n\nI even restarted the server and I'm still able to login in as root...\nI also added a new user before i did all this.\nAm I missing a step?\n\nA: PermitRootLogin is an sshd (the daemon) setting, not an ssh (the client) setting. It should go into /etc/ssh/sshd_config, where I'm reasonably certain you'll find a PermitRootLogin line.\n\nA: Just wanted to put this out there since on a normal iso install root account is disabled (unless maybe you enabled it) \nI'm going to assume you didn't and you're using a cloud based service like maybe Digital Ocean, as they have root enabled unless you setup a key. \nIf this is the case, as I also use digital ocean, I find it is sometimes easier to allow root login, but restrict access by ip address. \nIn this way, if you're doing something where you definitely need root access, you can save some time by logging into root rather than your user account and then using sudo and having to put your password in again. \nThis is also done in /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nAt the bottom of the file add the line \nAllowUsers root@youripaddress \n\nOr if I'm way off base here and you enabled the root account you can also limit access by local address only. \nAllowUsers root@192.168.1.100\n\nOr you can allow any computer access on your LAN\nAllowUsers root@192.168.1.x\n\nIf you do go this route, you may also want to define your regular user as well, cause I think if you setup AllowUsers and don't include that user it won't let you connect. So as an example, let's say you want to allow root access from xxx.xxx.x.xx, but allow user fer access from anywhere, the setting would look like \nAllowUsers root@xxx.xxx.x.xx fer@*\n\n@* means from anywhere\nYou can also DenyUsers much in the same way to prevent certain users ssh access. \n", "Q: Rootkit detector: rkhunter auto database update options In the rkhunter config file here /etc/default/rkhunter it says:\n# Defaults for rkhunter automatic tasks\n# sourced by /etc/cron.*/rkhunter and /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90rkhunter\n#\n# This is a POSIX shell fragment\n#\n\n# Set this to yes to enable rkhunter daily runs\n# (default: true)\nCRON_DAILY_RUN=\"\"\n\n# Set this to yes to enable rkhunter weekly database updates\n# (default: true)\nCRON_DB_UPDATE=\"\"\n\n# Set this to yes to enable reports of weekly database updates\n# (default: false)\nDB_UPDATE_EMAIL=\"false\"\n\n# Set this to the email address where reports and run output should be sent\n# (default: root)\nREPORT_EMAIL=\"root\"\n\n# Set this to yes to enable automatic database updates\n# (default: false)\nAPT_AUTOGEN=\"false\"\n\n# Nicenesses range from -20 (most favorable scheduling) to 19 (least favorable)\n# (default: 0)\nNICE=\"0\"\n\n# Should daily check be run when running on battery\n# powermgmt-base is required to detect if running on battery or on AC power\n# (default: false)\nRUN_CHECK_ON_BATTERY=\"false\" \nAPT_AUTOGEN=\"yes\"\n\nWhat are the options which talk about auto database updates?

Or do I only choose whether I want it weekly, or daily?\n\nA: A rootkit is the nastiest piece of malware you can have on your system and basically they're  mostly self-hiding toolkits used by blackhats, crackers and scriptkiddies, to avoid the prying eyes of the sysadmin.  So it also takes a lot of skill to detect these and rootkit removal is always done through re-install. \nIn the README of Rkhunter, it is clearly stated that the software doesn't know everything about your specific machine and that it works by creating a file properties database with rkhunter --propupd after a clean install of your OS...  :P \nSo the answer to your question is: No, this is not like an anti-virus database at all: it is not medicine you take after you've been compromised, but more like a vaccination before you contract Ebola!  ;-)\nSo by now (if you've actually read all the links above) you know that this is very good software (the best), but that it takes a lot of work to actually run and maintain and that installing it on a system that is already compromised is useless.

Yesterday, something happened while I was modifying a simple text file in my admin/regular user account. Now I can only print or perform actions involving keys if I press them down and wait for the thud sound twice. It is not so in the guest account. \nAnyone have any idea as to what might be the cause of the problem? I might have unknowingly turned on something by hitting some keys?\n\nA: Somehow I managed to fix it. \nSome of the solutions on-line said to do this:\nsudo apt-get install scrim-bridge-client-qt\n\nI did that and didn't notice any change. I then removed Guest Additions from VirtualBox because some said that might the problem. Then I added it again. \nI Rebooted after every step multiple times. \nFinally I noticed that the keyboard worked if I held down any key for a long time. I went and increased the reaction time to pressing the key in the keyboard setting... and voila!

This computer is windows native. While running Ubuntu, where are the files stored, are they stored on the USB? And if so will the files, desktop settings, etc still be there if i were to say reboot on windows and later reboot on Linux or if I took the USB out and booted it on a different PC?\n\nA: If you created your USB drive with persistent storage, the files are stored in an \"overlay filesystem\" which resides in the USB stick, in a file called \"casper-rw\", which is essentially a complete ext4 filesystem containing the files created \"on top\" of the base installation.\nThe files will be maintained in the scenarios you mention, if you created the USB drive with persistent storage. You can also mount the \"casper-rw\" file in another Linux computer to retrieve your files.\nSo the key is to create the USB stick with the persistent storage option.\n\nA: The short answer is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Yes to the \"the files [are] stored on the USB\" and\n\n*Yes to the \"[they] will be there if [you] were to say reboot on\nwindows and later reboot on Linux or if [you] took the USB out and\nbooted it on a different PC\".\n\n\nNevertheless we must consider some things:\nFirst of all, the files will be stored on the USB if the USB has been prepared to save the information on it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allowing extra space to save the data for Live sessions\n\n*Having enough space to save the data if the Ubuntu OS has been\ninstalled on the USB as an operating system.\n\n*You care of the place where to save your data and let the software\nknow the right place (inside the USB) where to keep your data.\n\n*You don't simply disconnect the USB while the data is yet unsaved on\nthe USB.\n\n\nIf you shut the computer down as if Ubuntu were a hard disk drive installed OS, then the data will stay on the USB and you'll be able to try booting in a different computer and access the data which is tripping inside the USB.\nPlease note that I say: \"try booting in a different computer\", because of nobody can say Ubuntu will properly boot on any computer. Remember there are old computers which won't allow you booting from USB and other scenarios in which the USB simply won't boot. So please have that in consideration and make a \"Plan B\" for the situation. Let's say: Having a bootable Live CD will temporarily fix the issue.\nNow, for what is about booting on Windows. You may face some situation in order to reach your precious files inside the USB if you try to access from Windows, because of Windows won't natively support Linux Filesystems (ext2, ext3, ext4, etc.) thus this will force you to install some third party software in order to gain read only or read/write access to the data inside the USB.\nGood luck!\n\nA: A persistent install of Ubuntu will use the first casper-rw file or partition it encounters while booting.\nIf you have a casper-rw partition on your hard drive and a casper-rw file on your flash drive, the partition on your hard drive will be active when booting the flash drive. \nIf you have a casper-rw partition on your flash drive and also a casper-rw file on your flash drive the casper-rw partition will become active.\nYou can take the persistence files and partitions stored on your flash drive with you, you can not take persistence with you if it is stored on your hard drive, (easily).\nTo make things more complex you can also use persistent partitions and files named home-rw that only store home folder stuff.\n", "Q: Running program from a remote machine I am currently working with 2 machines.

You can visit https://apps-sa.mcmaster.ca/enhance and have a look. \nI looked through the logs and there is absolutely nothing I can find related to the error.\n\nA: AllowOverride None is now the default for Apache 2.4, so you need to explicitly allow overrides if you plan to use .htaccess files. If you intend to use mod_rewrite or other settings in .htaccess files, you can allow which directives declared in that file can override server configuration.

I had hoped to leave Windows behind by installing ubuntu but having attempted to download and burn an install disc 3 times, the PC will not run it from boot. I have accessed BIOS to re-prioritise the boot order, putting CD to the top, and it attempts to run the DVD for a while then eventually reverts to Windows, which is tied to the old work network so I can't even log in. I also tried disabling all other boot options, and it just gets stuck on the manufacturer (Acer) screen. \nWhat is the first port of call for troubleshooting? The drive, the disc or is something deeper preventing this from working?\nAny ideas much appreciated!\nUPDATE - after a long time hung on the Acer screen the system eventually went to a \"DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER\"\nMy guess is I'm not burning the boot disk correctly? What could be going wrong?\n\nA: The most likely issue is how you created the boot disk, and which kernel it uses. This is a problem with trying to create the 'boot disk' on Windows/Mac (ie. not Ubuntu).\nUse a USB stick instead, and its much faster.\nThe cheats method is Ask A Friend. Get someone to create a USB boot stick on their copy of Ubuntu.\nOtherwise, look it up. You need a Windows based tool that supports the version of Ubuntu you are trying to install, and a spare 2GB (or 4GB) USB stick.\n\nDon't rely on boot-order, but instead use manually select boot device.\nNote: Start by setting BIOS back to the way it was.\n", "Q: Cannot log in with correct password after installing VirtualBox and Genymotion and editing /etc/profile This is a rather bizarre problem that I am experiencing.

In my case it was an error in the /etc/profile that I had edited last night.\n\nA: Among all the possible issues the most common two are:\nThe .Xauthority file in the user's home directory could be owned by root. The ownership and permissions should look like:\n-rw-------  1 user user   58 Feb 13 07:37 .Xauthority\n\nIn this case you need to delete the /home/user/.Xauthority file owned by root logging in from a console (<ALT>+<CTL>+<F1-7>) and then try to login to the xsession.\nAnother thing that can happen is that the /tmp does not have the sticky bit set i.e. has the wrong permissions. The permissions should be:\ndrwxrwxrwt   8 root   root    4096 Feb 13 08:17 tmp\n\nIn this case you need to set the sticky bit to /tmp by logging in from a console:\nsudo chmod 1777 /tmp\n\n\nA: Are you able to log in by hitting CTRL+ALT+F1 to bring up a terminal and then put in your username and password.

You could update beautifully by recompiling the latest upstream Kernel, which would probably fix the touchpad issue but it's a lot of extra work. I recompile my Kernel for the extra support and performance increase but not many would find this a suitable answer.\n\nA: It's an old version of Ubuntu but you can still make it run fast using the latest kernel and compiling it. Here are the steps:\ntar -xvf linux-3.19.tar.xz\n\ncd linux-3.19\n\nmake oldconfig  <-- this will cause many, many questions. Just hit enter through them all.\nmake makelocalconfig  <-- Do this after you plug in all your devices so it will load the modules.\nsudo make xconfig <-- edit the features and drivers you want to add or remove\nsudo sudo CONCURRENCY_LEVEL=`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN` CFLAGS=\"-O3 -march=bdver2\" CXXFLAGS=\"-O3 -march=bdver2\" make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-joel319 kernel_image kernel_headers\n\nChange bdver2 to native and change joel319 to whatever tag you want to use.\nNow install Grub Customizer to select the kernel and add a bootmenu.\nAgain, this is probably not the answer you want but it fixes and speeds up the system. I've done it before too when my touchpad didn't work.\n", "Q: Edgers PPA Graphic Drivers Automatic Update This may be a dumb question but does the Edgers PPA provide automatic updating? IE will the Edgers PPA automatically install newer releases of Nvidia drivers? Thanks. \n\nA: Yes if you had activated this PPA in your system all packages will receive updates on performing\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nor from the GUI update manager. This will however not only upgrade your Nvidia graphics drivers but also upgrade all other packages this ppa provides.\nAutomatic or unattended (security) updates will not be provided by this ppa.\nAs the Xorg Edgers ppa provides bleeding edge and incompletely tested upgrades you will have a high risk to install instable or buggy packages that in rare cases may even break your system. \n\nIt is therefore not recommended to have this ppa active on a productive machine where stability matters.\n\nAlso see:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?  \n\n*How can PPAs be removed?  \n\n*Notes and warnings for the Xorg Edgers PPA\n", "Q: Account removal on Ubuntu 14.10 Will removing an administrator account remove my ppas added in my repository?\n\nA: No, ppa and repositories are configured as a part of system configuration (apt) and not as a part of user accounts.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu\nYou need access to root, ie an administrative login, to configure the system however.\n", "Q: Will support for 14.10 stop this year? A month back I have transitioned from Windows to Linux and I have utopic installed in my system. No complaints till now! :D\nWhat I wanted to know was as this is not an LTS release, will I face security problems after development for utopic is stopped this year?\n\nA: \nThis question comes up infinitely and has been answered many times.  We should probably create a canonical question for this.\n\nAfter a release goes End of Life, there are zero updates to the repositories.  Eventually after End of Life, the repositories for that release get migrated to oldreleases, which only holds the archive state as it was at the EOL date.\nYou will not get any security updates or bugfixes if you continue to use an EOL release.  It is highly advisable that you upgrade from 14.10 to 15.04 after it EOLs (and after 15.04 is released), or that you use the LTS release (14.04) if you plan on not upgrading your Ubuntu version every interim release.\n\nThe problem with EOL releases is you have to either do a fresh install (to an LTS) or an in-place upgrade (to 15.04 after it is released).\nIf you do a fresh installation, you'll lose everything unless you back up your files, and you will still likely not have everything that 14.10 had in it.\nIf you do an in-place upgrade to 15.04 after 15.04 releases, you can keep most of your settings, but some programs might have dropped away.  You have to examine the upgrade tasks closely before hitting \"OK\" on the upgrade.  Do note that with upgrades, bugs and other problems can arise.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.10 will ends life on July 2015, link.\nAfter EOL, may be you will not face any security issues. But after that you will not get any support from Ubuntu community. You can not get any updates(including security updates) for your system. So you will miss latest technologies which will be develop by Ubuntu community.\nSo after end of life, move to 15.04 or if you will not like to change the versions frequently move to 14.04 LTS.  \n", "Q: Replacing old OS will format entire hard disk? I am new to Ubuntu. My laptop is currently running Windows 7 with C, D partition as virtual disks.\nNow, I want to have a laptop that runs clean and fresh Ubuntu, and nothing else. All old system data, personal data, viruses, trojan should be completely removed and no partition virtual disks (Disk C, Disk D like in Windows). In an other word, my laptop should get started over again like a newly bought one.\nI guess \"Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu\" option may help. But I am not sure if it will help to format and reset my hard disk OR it will just delete old Windows in C drive and leave other data existed in D drive?\nPlease advice me. \nThanks for your time.\n\nA: \nIt will just delete old Windows in C drive and leave other data existed in D drive?\n\nIt will delete all Windows partitions. The partitioner will assume that all NTFS disks belong to Windows and delete it. It will then create 1 big disk to install Ubuntu. If you do not want this and want the partitions to be split into / and /home/ or /, /home/, /datapartition/\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the \"something else\" option. \n\n*Delete all the partitions so you have one big block of \"unallocated space\". This will delete all Windows data. \n\n*Create new partitions to your liking. In general 25 Gb for a / partition should be enough unless you want to use servers like Apache or MySQL.\n\n*Allocate a few Gb to a swap area. What the ideal amount is depends on your memory; have a look around AU for some topics about this. What swapfile size to make? I have 4GB RAM and I have 16GB RAM. Do I need 32GB swap? \n\n*Dedicate the remainder to /home/ or a part of it to /home/ and the remainder to a personal partition with a label you set it up with. \n\n", "Q: .sh command not working in a desktop launcher I'm using a desktop launcher to run a.sh script.

The\n   offending process could even be umount itself - it opens libc, and libc\n   in  its  turn may open for example locale files.

The backslashes are used to denote command continuation onto another line, but if you are copying and pasting, then extra tabs and spaces can get picked up. Try using the following one line example:\nffmpeg -i oceans.mov -an -c:v libx264 -r 24 -preset fast -profile:v baseline -g 64 -keyint_min 64 -b:v:0 230k -maxrate 250k -s:v:0 304x128 -x264opts pic-struct:no-scenecut -movflags frag_keyframe -f ismv oceans-250k.ismv\n\nIt is not as neatly presented in documentation, i.e. with the scroll bar, but lends itself better to copy and paste.\nYour previous command, may only have been ffmpeg -i oceans.mov -an -c:v libx264 -r 24 -preset fast (with the rest after the first \\ being discarded by the shell), and as that contains no filename at the end, then that is why you would have received the error message that you did.\n", "Q: How do I start completely over with the latest version of Ubuntu?

The solution is to find the commands in ~/.bashrc and remove or comment out those.\n", "Q: Partitions not showing on windows neither in ubuntu I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 along with the existing windows 8 ....\nI have made three partitions of / , /boot and swap, but seems as it is not visible on windows neither on Ubuntu. What can do for visibility of these drives?\n\nA: Windows can't see the Ubuntu partition because Ubuntu's file system type is ext4. In the file manager Computer is the / partition and the swap and /boot is not for you to see. If you really need to see them, then install gparted.  \n", "Q: Partitioning for dual boot My motherboard is a Asus am1l-a with a uefi bios. I have a 120 gb ssd and a 3tb hdd I plan on adding another 3tb hdd. I plan on installing Ubuntu as my main os and Arch as a secondary just for messing around with. This is primarily going to be a htpc and will store most of my music and movies. It will also be a small Minecraft server for at most four of my friends and I. My question is, what would you recommend as a partitioning scheme?\n\nA: *\n\n*All of the /home on HDD, OS on SSD\n\n*At a minimum, split your / from your /home for your \"production\" OS (Ubuntu). If you want to split even more have a look at the FHS.  64GB /, 2TB /home\n\n*One swap partition for both OSes (Minimum size = RAM, Max size=RAM*2) \n\n*If Arch is to mess around with, 32GB /, 512 GB /home\n\n*Yes, not all of your disk space is allocated: just keep that as 'spare' to move & extend existing partitions if needed. (or bcache the HDDs)\n\n*Some other possibilities\nFreebies you didn't ask for:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you plan on adding another 3TB drive: Don't use software RAID!  It's prone to software and hardware errors so divide your MTBF by 2 for 1 OS and by 4 for 2 OSes  \n\n*If you plan to use hardware RAID: Don't use RAID0: divide your MTBF by 2 if you do.\n\n*Make frequent system back-ups (You're definitely user type 4)\n\n", "Q: cannot move cursor to external monitor I just connected my external monitor and it all works fine. I tested this even in windows. But on ubuntu I cannot take the cursor to the external monitor. It just doesn't move there and it gets stuck at the laptop screen boundary. I cannot move it beyond that.\n\nA: Most likely one of these situations is the case (In the example, HP 22\" is my main screen)\nThe screen is misaligned or in another position than you assume\nOpen System settings > Screens:\n1. the screen is misaligned\n\n2. the screen is positioned differently from what you assume: on the left side..\n\n... or on top:\n\nSimply drag the window in another position if one of these situations is the case.\nSticky edges\nAnother thing that makes it easier to move from one screen to another is switching the \"Sticky edges\" (\"plakranden\" in the screen shot below) option to off:\n\n\nA: Looks in System Settings - > Displays how configuration of your system looks like. \nIf all is okay and it looks like you predicted then try to move your mouse fast, sometimes my screen may not work for some reasons even if I know that I'm on the level of the screen I need. If all of it isn't work problem may be with the cabal change your hdmi/dvi or other.\n\nA: Another possibility (which is rare) is there are some space between monitors. This means, even though left and right monitor are aligned with each other, there are some tiny space between these two. In my case, it is about 2.5mm visible space on my 24\"in wide screen. So it feels like hard to move between boundaries. What actually happens is that cursor is moving in those ghost space area you can't see and therefore cause the delay.\nThe fix is to make sure monitor are really side by side on your 'display' setting.\n", "Q: Bypass FTP,RemoteLogin,SMTP,TELNET through Squid3 proxy server which is installed on ubuntu 14.04.1 Hi i have installed squid3 proxy server & the server is located between the switch & router all the traffic flows through squid3 server i am not able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access FTP using filezilla software\n\n*Not able to update the mails as i am using thunderbird & microsoft outlook.\n\n*Not able to take remote of server outside the network using putty & Remote Desktop connection (Microsofts inbuilt tool)\n\n*Not able to send skype messages outside the network\n\n*Not able to commit or update in eclipse when the traffic flows through squid3 server below is the version & error in eclipse\nVersion: Indigo Service Release 2\nBuild id: 20120216-1857\nEclipse IDE for Java Developers\n\nError is propfind request failed on 'svn trunk'.\nAbove tasks works fine when connected directly to router but doesn't work when the traffic flows through squid3\nI am able to\n\n\n*\n\n*Browse http & https     \n\n*Generate logs\n\n\nI am not so familar with squid & iptables So please help me\nI have not modified squid.conf file i have only entered the Network details & uncommented net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\nwhich is present in /etc/sysctl.conf file\nBelow is the nework configuration\nauto eth0  ( ON board Ethernet port & is connected to ROuter)\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.2.8\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.2.0\nbroadcast 192.168.2.255\ngateway 192.168.2.5\ndns-nameservers 192.168.2.5 8.8.8.8\n\nauto eth1 ( LAN card IS connected to switch & clients are connected to switch) \niface eth1\ninet static\naddress 192.168.1.120\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.5\ndns-nameservers 192.168.2.5 8.8.8.8\n\nClients have ip of 192.168.1.IP\nHave checked entering the gateway 192.168.1.1 & 192.168.1.120(Squid proxy server address)\nat clients network settings\nBelow is my squid.conf file content\n# Recommended minimum configuration:\n#\n\n# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.\n# Adapt to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing\n# should be allowed\n#acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8    #

One thing I do frequently is closing windows and closing tabs. Is it possible to set the F1 button to close windows in Ubuntu 14.04? (i.e. same behavior as ALT+F4) And scroll lock or F2 to close tabs (i.e. same behavior as CTRL+W)\nUsing the Keyboard --> Shortcuts, the F1 simply opens the help menu for the keyboard application. It cannot set it as shortcut \"value\". And there's no entry for closing tabs.\nThe latter may be application-specific. So a keyboard intercepter solution may be the way to go. If possible, I'd like ALT+F4 etc. to keep working.\n\nA: You can keep the Alt+F4 shortcut if you define a new custom shortcut. Here are three possible solutions:\nUsing xbindkeys and xdotool\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the packages by opening a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool xbindkeys xbindkeys-config \n\n\n*Run xbindkeys-config from the terminal\n\n\n*Press New create a new key binding.\n\n*Write F1 in the Key field to the left or press Get Key to grab a key or key combinations. Note that this may create a lot of gibberish such as Mod2 + F1 | m:0x10 + c:67 but it still works.\n\n*Enter into the Action field to the left:\n xdotool getwindowfocus key alt+F4\n\n.... or whatever other key combination you want to execute.\n\n*Press Apply. It works now.\nUsing Keyboard Settings and xdotool\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the xdotool package, open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Now define a custom keyboard shortcut using the System Settings Menu:\n\nSet the command to xdotool getwindowfocus key alt+F4\n\n*The next step requires to go back to the command line as you can't type F1 to define a new accelerator. So list all the defined custom shorcuts with:\n$ dconf list /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/\ncustom0/\ncustom1/\n\nThe one you've just created should be the last one, here custom1.\nType the following command to assign F1 to close the active window:\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom1/binding \"'F1'\"\n\nAdjust the custom<id> to match yours.\nYour new F1 shortcut is ready to use (needless to log out or restart your system) and Alt+F4 still works. \nUsing Keyboard Settings and xte\nFor keys without special meaning to the Keyboard-application (like F2), you don't have to go through command line to do the key binding:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xte:\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\n\n*Create your new shortcut using the System Setting menu as explained for F1 just above but with the following command instead:\nxte 'keydown Control_L' 'keydown w' 'keyup Control_L' 'keyup w'\n\n\n*Assign F2 to the shortcut, it works from the Shortcut window this time.\n", "Q: Permission Denied error message while running C++ program in Code Blocks I installed Code Blocks from Software Center. I wrote a C++ program and built it and it was fine, but whenever I try to run the compiled code it gives me this error: Permission denied. How can I fix this problem?\n\nA: You need the execute permission to run/execute the file. If the file is /home/user/test.cpp and you are the owner of the file then to execute the file you need the permission bits like: \n-rwxr--r--  1 user user      1490 Feb 13 12:07 /home/user/test.cpp\n\nHere only the owner ('user' in this example) can read, write and execute the file whereas the group ('user' in this case) and all others can only read the file.\nTo set the permission like this run the following command from Terminal:\nsudo chmod 744 /home/user/test.cpp\n\nIf you do so, the execute bit will be set and you will now be able to execute the file.\n\nA: Check permission for that particular c++ file that you have created.ls.If permission is not there,then use chmod.\n\nA: Problem can be your Drive where c++ file is saved.

The installation was successful. After the first login, I just check the system info and press \"Install update\" to update. After restarting, my laptop just cannot login. It shows a blank screen and I still can hear the Ubuntu login sound but can not see anything rather than a blank screen. Maybe some issue with my graphic card. Please help.\nThanks.\nPS: I want to note that the screen does not display anything, it's not really a blank screen.\n\nA: Usually, when the display server is not responding you can still obtain a non-graphical login screen by typing Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nThen you should be able to login, and you should look at the log file /var/log/Xorg.0.log. Please paste here any error appearing in this file.\n\nA: Check if you've enough disk space, in a login screen by typing Ctrl+Alt+F1. then login the system and type this command : \ndf -kh\n\nIf you've any 100% partition full that could block gnome starting.\n", "Q: Run only parts of a script as sudo, entering password only once I am writing a script (actually a combination of scripts and makefile) that installs external dependencies: some apt-get commands, some git cloning, building, installing, adding users to groups, ...\nSome of the operations in these scripts require superuser permissions, some don't. \nUntil now I have run the entire make process with sudo, but it has some drawbacks:\n\n\n*\n\n*git repos I clone get root as owner, which means I can't modify them afterwards without sudo or chown\n\n*the scripts that add users to groups don't know which user to add since whoami returns root\nWhat is the best way of running as superuser only the commands that require it? Ideally the process would still require me to enter my sudo password, but only once at the very beginning of the install process. It would then forget it at the very end, but keep it all the time until then (it can take several hours).\nThe solutions I have found online include:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo -v at the begninning of the script, but if I understand correctly this times out. My script could be running for a couple of hours\n\n*running the script with sudo, but the commands that do not need superuser with sudo -u $(logname) <command>. This is what I do now, but it feels like it should be the other way around.\n\n\nIdeally, I would like my script to:\n\n\n*\n\n*ask for superuser credentials\n\n*run normal commands as the logged in user\n\n*run sudo commands with the credentials entered at step 1\n\n*sudo -k to close the superuser session\n\n\nA: Since you have sudo access, create a sudoers file for yourself, then delete it when the script is done:\n# grant this user access to the sudo commands without passwords\n# add all required cmds to the CMDS alias\nsudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/$USER <<END\n$USER $(hostname) = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/sbin/adduser, /bin/rm, ...\nEND\n\n# your script goes here\nsudo apt-get install ...\ngit clone ...\nsudo adduser group2 $USER\nsudo adduser group1 $USER\n: ...\n\n# then, remove the sudo access\nsudo /bin/rm /etc/sudoers.d/$USER\nsudo -k\n\n\nA: One way, that I wouldn't generally recommend, is to read in the password yourself, and use sudo's -S option to pass the password as and when needed:\n#! /bin/bash\nIFS= read -rsp 'Enter your password: ' password\ngit clone ...\nsudo -S apt-get install foo -y <<<\"$password\"\n\nFrom man sudo:\n -S, --stdin\n             Write the prompt to the standard error and read the password\n             from the standard input instead of using the terminal device.\n             The password must be followed by a newline character.\n\n", "Q: Shortcut functions of Libre Calc I am new to Ubuntu as well as Libre Office.

I compiled pdo_oci directly from the source code for my version of php (I followed instructions on: http://blog.appwhoosh.com/install-pdo_oci-oci8-extensions-for-ubuntu-14-10/).\nNow the extension works perfectly.\n\nA: After installing the Oracle drivers, you can use this this class here and then you just need to change your PDO connection from something like\n$pdo = new PDO(\"oci:dbname=mydatabase;charset=utf8\", \"user\", \"password\");\n\nto\n$pdo = new PDOOCI\\PDO(\"mydatabase\", \"user\", \"password\");\n\nThe rest should work exactly the same as if you were using a PDO object.\n", "Q: Custom Daily and Weekly Cron Jobs Not Running I created a script to back up my databases and my websites.

I'm not sure if that is the issue. If it is, how do I avoid that?\nI did make a change to the time that cron jobs run.

Before downloading new version I've been removing the old ones (they where all in /etc). Well so I thought, because now I find them in usr/shr.

Mirroring on Raid0 I've got a laptop, that I want to migrate to ZFS filesystem.\nThis laptop has 2HDD Drives. \nMy zpool idea is like this:\n1 zpool on 2 HDD drives. \n/ - separate subvol\n/home - separate subvol with 'copies=2'\n\nWill this benefit of 2 HDD drives? For example, if 1st HDD would fail, would I be able to recover the /home partition? \n\nA: ZFS does attempt to store copies on different drives according to https://blogs.oracle.com/relling/entry/zfs_copies_and_data_protection.  However, copies, from what I understand it, are to protect from data corruption in the filesystem, but are not guaranteed to be stored on different drives.  I also don't know if ZFSonLinux has included the same exact copies functionality.  RAID0, or striping, is dangerous but I'm sure you already knew that.\nYour best bet is to create two different pools.  Create two partitions on each disk, make a striped zpool from one and a mirrored zpool on the other.\n\nA: With two mirrored devices in your pool that would be fine.  If one fails you can recover the data from the second one; replace the failed one.\nhttps://blogs.oracle.com/partnertech/entry/a_hands_on_introduction_to2\nI would never recommend putting two partitions on a single disk (someone else's suggestion) except for playing about or testing.

I've already installed java8 on this server, then I want to install tomcat8 using the \"apt-get\" way(not the binary way).But After lots of googling,I can't find the solution，most of the solutions are using the binary way(download the apache-tomcat-8.X.X.tar.gz,then unzip it and start the tomcat...)\n\nA: Tomcat8 is now present in the repositories and can be installed using this aptitude command:\nsudo apt-get install tomcat8\n\n\nA: Tomcat 8 is not in the repositories for Ubuntu 14.04. \nYou could install Tomcat 7, as this is in the repositories, by running sudo apt-get install tomcat7.\n", "Q: What is the difference between a Snappy apps and Charms (and click) I have heard that the system in use to package and install apps in sandboxes on ubuntu is the click package on the desktopNext and phone/tablet.\nIf I have understood well, a snappy ubuntu core apps, is packaged the same way as a click apps (both using apparmor), It might be tagged \"snappy\" to be sure they target a server, not a client device.\nI also know there are some charms on the Ubuntu server's Juju tool to install apps on a server.\nAre those those click/snappy apps same as a Charm ?\n\nI am right if I say charms are like containers that can install .deb or snappy apps and also add some metadata to allow the Juju tool to know (for example) how to configure the apps, or how to connect apps together so it will be easier to a human to configure his environement full of techi server apps ; And those charm are just made to work on Juju, to be deployed at scale, not necessarily on only 1 device ?\n\nA: Charms aren't packages, charms are code and metadata that deploy services across multiple machines; so they consume debian packages. People have made analogies that charms are like \"cloud packages\" or \"apt-get for the cloud\", but it's not a packaging system as much as it is a collection of code.\nA typical charm install hook might contain apt-get commands to install software from a repository, or they might grab tarballs, or they might even contain the binaries themselves. It's really up to the charm author how a charm installs the software.\nI would expect as snappy becomes more popular that many charms will choose to use snappy packages for installation, or at least offer it as an option. It should be noted that currently you can't deploy a charm to a snappy system, but there's no reason this wouldn't be an option for people in the future.\n\nA: A Charm is more similar to a Puppet Module or a Chief Recipe. Charms, Modules, and Recipes are mechanisms for orchestration which is different than package management.  Orchestration involves the installation and management of the installed resources.  The orchestration software can dynamically configure the installed software customized for the user.  It can manage that configuration over time as well.  Take for instance an web certificate.  Certificates expire after some time.  Orchestration software can install the certificate.  When the certificate needs to be replaced, the orchestration software can managed the update (automatically).\nIts my personal opinion that Puppet is the best orchestration software.  Its the oldest, has the most support, is Free Source, has a great community, has multitudes of documentation, has its own programming language, is actively developing and evolving.  The latest version of puppet has defined types!!!\nI know that one can write puppet code to create a charm, but you are losing out of the other benefits of running a puppet system.  When using puppet, its best to leverage the puppet server for managing the entire lifecycle of the software and systems.\nI'm not terribly familiar with charms, but I think they do not manage system resources like Puppet.  The important bit is change management.  IE, puppet ensures that the resources it knows about are in the correct state.  Meaning, if an admin ssh's into the box and changes a configuration file manually (maybe he is debugging), puppet will revert the changes back to what's specified in the puppet code.  I don't think charms have this capability.  Please correct me if I am wrong.\n", "Q: Missing tools.jar (Android Studio) The command\n$ ~/android-studio/bin/studio.sh\n\nsays\n'tools.jar' seems to be not in Android Studio classpath.

(FAIL)\n\n\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: As per output mentioned for command\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\nI can see that you have only JRE installed but you also need JDK to compile and run the code.\nYou can install JDK for Java 8 using following command :\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk\n\nAnd then run \nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\ncommand and select JDK instead of JRE.\n\nA: I was getting the same error, and found that I did not have the java compiler installed.\nTry javac -version and see if you have it installed. If not, \nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\nand hopefully that will fix your problem.\nEDIT: I see now after rereading that you have already installed the jvm once, but I had it installed as well, so I'm not sure if something got updated or what but like I said it worked for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem. There has nothing to do on JAVA_HOME or configure-alternatives. The truth is there is no tools.jar in oracle-java-9(even in open-jdk). To use android-studio in the Ubuntu you must use java-8. Why? I don't know and I don't care! I must to learn Android Studio, so whatever...\nInstall jdk-8 for android-studio, change PATH and JAVA_HOME environment and be happy!\nWorks for me...\n\nA: sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless\n\n\nA: because studio.sh is a script itself, running JAVA_HOME=.. is not enough. Instead, make sure you run:\n\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64\n\n\nA: Maybe you have a Oracle JDK installed and conflicted with OpenJDK, use:\n\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64\n\n\nA: IN LINUX DEBIAN :\n1.- Open Synaptic and search \"openjdk\".\n2.- checks that do not have more than one installed version of the package \"openjdk-?\".\n3.- uninstall all file with old version and left alone all file with new version.\n4.- Check that your Java Version have change from terminal \"#java -version\".\n5.- try again install  studio.sh \n", "Q: How to specify installation directory when installing packages I'm somewhat new to linux, in college its the preferred by my computer science professors so I decided to install Ubuntu and Kubuntu alongside my windows 8 installation. Now, here's my problem.\nI read somewhere that its best to keep files in a separate partition than your linux installation, so if you ever upgrade, you don't lose all your stuff.

Eliah Kagan has a great answer that says why, and it boils down to: everything has a place, the system looks for things in specific places because it's linux, moving things will confuse the hell out of it (and you!). \n\n\nThe common wisdom seems to be that spliting partitions reduces damage.

When running the command apt-get I got all the possible options and commands for apt-get. But one of these commands and definitions I have not seen before:\ndselect-upgrade - Follow dselect selections\n\nI ran the command sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade just to see what happened and this was the output:\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\n0 to upgrade, 0 to newly install, 0 to remove and 0 not to upgrade.\n\nSo what does this command actually do? And what does it mean to Follow dselect sections?\n\nA: As others have pointed out, it \"follows dselect choices\". One nice thing about this, is one can feed a list of packages selections to dpkg:\ndpkg --clear-selections\ndpkg --set-selections < package_choice_list\n\nthen do \"apt-get dselect-upgrade\" and it will remove anything not in the list, and install everything in the list. I don't think any other package tool can do that. It gives one a way to ensure \"these and only these\" packages are installed, which is very convenient.\n\nA: Source: man apt-get\ndselect-upgrade\n       dselect-upgrade is used in conjunction with the traditional Debian\n       packaging front-end, dselect(1).  dselect-upgrade follows the\n       changes made by dselect(1) to the Status field of available\n       packages, and performs the actions necessary to realize that state\n       (for instance, the removal of old and the installation of new\n       packages).\n\nSo the question you're really after is \"What is dselect?\" and this used to be a way to use the capacity of Debian packages for suggesting other packages for installation back when dinosaurs used to roam the Earth.  It does still work and even has its niches where it's still used, but nowadays there are easier ways to accomplish the same thing.\nFor a beginner's tutorial, look here.\n\nA: What I know is that dselect is used in backing up our system. \nYou can also use it to install the same packages in any other system as yours.\ndpkg --get-selection > packages.list This will create a list of all the packages installed in your system in the packages.list file.\nNow, if something happens and your system crashes, you can install all the packages which were in your system with the help of this packages.list file.\ndpkg --set-selections < packages.list\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\nThis will do the thing for you.

I reformatted the entire system and created new partitions. \n\nA: The problem is that you have changed permissions of files in /usr/bin. Some of these files need setuid bit (the file is run under the account of the file's owner which is root in /usr/bin) to work properly but by setting write bit to anyone else than the owner, this would create a massive security hole (anyone could change the content and run it as root), therefore setting the write bit removes the setuid bit.\nUnless you have btrfs with APT snapshotting, it is quite hard to determine what were the original permissions of the files in /usr/bin, you would basically need to reinstall all packages and it still may not set everything correctly. Therefore the easiest solution here is to reinstall the system as a whole.\nIf you do have btrfs with APT snapshotting (should be automatically enabled if you use btrfs for your system) and /usr or /usr/bin is not on a separate partition, it is possible to revert to an older snapshot where this change was not done yet. This can be done with the command apt-btrfs-snapshot in rescue mode (selected in GRUB):\n# List all available snapshots\napt-btrfs-snapshot list\n\n# Revert to a selected snapshot\napt-btrfs-snapshot set-default @apt-snapshot-YYYY-MM-DD_HH:mm:ss\n\n# Reboot to load the old system\nreboot\n\n", "Q: Where to install bootloader for ubuntu/windows dual boot ssd+hdd I'm brand new to ubuntu, but I've done a lot of research and I'm currently in the middle of installing ubuntu on my laptop. I looked everywhere for an answer to this question, but every answer out there has a setup slightly different to mine so I could not figure it out.\nI have 2 hard drives in my laptop, one 250gb ssd (C:) and a 1tb hdd (D: used only for storage). I have windows 8.1 currently installed on the ssd (Im trying to setup a dual boot with windows and ubuntu both on the ssd). The efi partition is also on the ssd. I manually created 3 ubuntu partitions all on the ssd (root, swap, and home).\nMy question is, where do i install the boot loader? I do not want ubuntu and windows to boot separately, so i was thinking the bootloader should go onto my ssd. The installer defaulted to dev/sda which it says is my 1tb hdd, but I can change it to dev/sdb which it says is my ssd. I'm not exactly sure where windows is booting from, but putting the bootloader on my hdd doesn't really make sense to me. So should I put the bootloader on dev/sda or deb/sdb? \nBtw, my laptop is uefi. \nThank you.\n\nA: Nevermind, I got it to work. I chose dev/sdb as the bootloader install location and everything worked perfectly. Upon reboot, the grub menu appeared and I can boot windows or ubuntu with no problems.\n\nA: Assuming your Windows EFI/bootloader is on sdb, adding Ubuntu's bootloader (shimnx64.efi/grubx64.efi) should just put them into the directory /EFI/ubuntu when you specify the EFI partition as the bootloader target.  Just specifying the device (e.g. sdb) has never worked for me (always just goes to the sda's EFI)  But, sometimes even specifying the partition (sdb1 or whatever) will not work either.  \nDefinitely back up the existing EFI partitions's directories and files (they are just files, so copy them somewhere), and expect to have to copy the shim/grubx64 into /EFI/ubuntu yourself.  While you are at it, another copy of the bootloaders put into /EFI/Boot may ease problems -- name the bootloader you use (shimx64.efi for secure boot, grubx64.efi otherwise) to bootx64.efi, and if that's shim you renamed, then copy over grubx64.efi too.  boot-repair does this, but it also does many other things, which probably not necessary.\n", "Q: Get IP Address of Machine from Hostname or Mac-address Is that possible to get the IP address of my machine from the hostname or the machine's own mac address?\nIf yes, how?\nIf not, could you suggest an alternative way?\n\nA: Of all the suggestions in the comments this one seems easiest.\nsudo apt-get install arp-scan\nsudo arp-scan --interface=wlan0 --localnet where wlan0 is your interface if your on a wire you'll likely change wlan0 to eth0.

Two examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using xdotool in a script:\n[you'd need xdotool to be installed]:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Compare (in a loop) two mouse positions, with a time interval:\nThe command to get the mouseposition from xdotool:\n$ xdotool getmouselocation\nx:1449 y:137 screen:0 window:79691788\n\n\n*If we parse this output in a (python) script, we can let it run a command if the mouse moves (if position1 does not equal position2):\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndef get_mousepos():\n    curr = subprocess.check_output([\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    return [int(it.split(\":\")[1]) for it in curr.split()[:2]]\n\ncurrent1 = get_mousepos()\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    current2 = get_mousepos()\n    if not current1 == current2:\n        # run a command:\n        print(\"action\")\n    current1 = current2\n\n\n\n*Using (python's) tkinter\nThe exact same process can also be done with python's own tkinter:\n[you'd need tkinter3 to be installed]:\nsudo apt-get install python3-tk\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The script, using tkinter:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom tkinter import*\nimport time\n\nroot = Tk()\n\ndef current_position():\n    return [root.winfo_pointerx(), root.winfo_pointery()]\n\npos1 = current_position()\nwhile True:\n   time.sleep(0.5)\n    pos2 = current_position()\n    if not pos1 == pos2:\n        # run a command:\n        print(\"action!\")\n    pos1 = pos2\n\nroot.mainloop()\n\nAn example related to what you are aiming at\nAn example of what can be done to control what command to run when the mouse trespasses a certain position (line) below.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\ndef get_mousepos():\n    curr = subprocess.check_output([\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    return [int(it.split(\":\")[1]) for it in curr.split()[:2]]\n\ncurrent1 = get_mousepos()\nwhile True:\n    current2 = get_mousepos()\n    # make the jump depend on the position and direction:\n    jump = 100 if current2[1] < 525 else -100\n    if current2[0] < 1000 and current1[0] >= 1000:\n        print(\"gone left\") # you can run any other command here, like:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", str(current2[0]), str(current2[1]+jump)])\n    elif current2[0] > 1000 and current1[0] <= 1000:\n        print(\"gone right\") # you can run any other command here\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", str(current2[0]), str(current2[1]-jump)])\n    current1 = current2\n\nIn this example, the mouse makes a jump when you move it from left to right or vice versa:\n\nIn this case, the mouse jumps a fixed jump. However, throwing some mathematics in, and move the jump line to the right side of your screen (+ a separate \"arrangement\" for the top left of the second screen), you can make the jump proportionally, to create the setup that you where aiming at in your first question: make (in a dual screen setup) both screens seem of the same vertical resolution when moving the mouse from one screen to another.\nThe \"dead corner\" where you cannot move the mouse from one screen to another would not exist then. (I have a working situation on my two screens)\nIt would still have a strange effect with windows if they are are spread over the two screens however, but it can be done.\n\n\nA: No, it's not possible without customizing drivers of your X environment.  There should be configuration-change methods to do what you want.\n", "Q: Can't detect my wireless card in a Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 11s I'm new to ubuntu and wanted to dive into the new OS to get a feel with Linux.

I never use virtual machine before.\nI plan to partition my hard drive (250GB) on a Thinkpad T400 laptop (8GB main memory, and install Ubuntu 14.04 as my main and host OS. \nIn the future, when I have to use some Windows software (such as Adobe Acrobat, MS Office, SAS), I will install a virtualization software program such as Virtualbox, KVM or VMWare Player, and then install and run Windows 7, 8.1 or 10 as a guest OS. \nSince I now plan to partition my disk, I want to leave enough space for virtual machine and guest OS (even though I might not need them now), and have some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In what partitions will the virtualization software program, and the guest OS be installed respectively?\n\n*If not considering what software applications which I will install and run under the guest Windows, how much space should I give for the guest OS and the virtualization software\n\n*if considering the software applications which I will install and run under the guest Windows, are the sizes taken by them similar to the sizes when they are installed under a Windows installed directly on a computer? E.g. will MS Office take up the same size when it is installed on a guest Windows as it is directly on a host Windows?\nThanks.\n\nA: \nIn what partitions will the virtualization software program, and the guest OS be installed respectively?\n\nAll virtualization software can use ordinary files and that is usually preferred for its simplicity but using allocated partitions/volumes is a bit faster. Virtualbox and KVM support LVM (VMware probably as well). To use LVM, you would set one partition for the whole disk, create LVM group inside it and create a LVM volume (not using the whole group) for your host system. New volumes can be then created, resized or removed when needed.\n\nIf not considering what software applications which I will install and run under the guest Windows, how much space should I give for the guest OS and the virtualization software\n\nThe virtualization software will not use any space from the disk allocated to the guest. For space requirements of the guest OS, consult the guest's official system requirements. It will be the same as when installed on a physical computer.\n\nif considering the software applications which I will install and run under the guest Windows, are the sizes taken by them similar to the sizes when they are installed under a Windows installed directly on a computer? E.g. will MS Office take up the same size when it is installed on a guest Windows as it is directly on a host Windows?\n\nYes, for the applications the system behaves just the same as on a physical computer so they will use the same amount of space.\n\nA: *\n\n*A guest OS of a virtual machine is a set of files and those file can be stored anywhere on your computer, including in your Ubuntu partition. By default VirtualBox stores the files of the guest OS in your user subfolder of your /home folder. \n\n*The recommended size of the virtual hard drive for a either a Windows 7 guest OS or a Windows 8.1 guest OS in VirtualBox is 25.00 GB. The recommended size of the virtual hard drive for a Windows 10 Technical Preview guest OS in VirtualBox is 20.00 GB, although the recommended size of the Windows 10 virtual hard drive may change when Windows 10 is officially released.\nWhen you create the virtual hard drive, you can choose whether the new virtual hard drive should grow as it is used (dynamically allocated) or if it should be created at its maximum size (fixed size). A dynamically allocated hard drive file will only use space on your physical hard drive as it fills up (up to a maximum fixed size), although it will not shrink again automatically when space on it is freed. \n\n*The space taken by an application in a guest OS running in a virtual machine is the same as the space that would be taken by that application if it was installed in the same operating system running in a physical machine.\n", "Q: How to restore accidentally removed Launcher icon for external drive in Unity? Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit: I used to get an icon for my portable drive on insertion. I have accidentally lost this by clicking on 'Unlock from Launcher' instead of 'Eject'. Now this icon does not appear when the drive is connected. How do I restore the original behaviour?\n\nA: 1. Command line:\nYou can do that by the command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist \"[]\"\n\nExplanation\nBy removing the icon from the launcher, you blacklisted the device from the launcher. With the command above, you \"empty\" the blacklist.\nIf you want to to have a more selective way to set which device to keep in the launcher, first run:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist\n\nThe output will be like:\n['<device_1>', '<device_2>']\n\nTo restore device_1 in the launcher:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist \"['<device_2>']\"\n\n2.

The mouse and keyboard were unresponsive and I was unable to change to another tty, so I pressed the reset button on my pc and when It turned on, my wallpaper have reset to the original as well as all my compiz and unity configs. At first I thought the configuration had reset but when I tried to adjust it I failed.\nWhen I unlock an item from the launcher it just reappear a few seconds later. When I try to maximize the launcher it just maximizes for a fraction of a second and goes to the normal size. When I lock a new icon to the launcher, it disappears a few seconds later. In the unity tweak tool, system settings or compiz config if I change an option it goes back to the previous state instantly, like if I check a checkbox it automatically unchecks and the same for all the options (switches, drop down menus, texts fields, etc...)\nThe only lead I have is that I install some updates (ubuntu base) a few hours before my computer crashing. I don't know if something is broken in the new update or what is happening.\nSomebody has any idea?\n\nA: I would create a new user, and see if they have the same problem.   Just a guess here I think it may be a config issue. \nSince it does not re-appear with a new user it's a config file somewhere.   I would google resetting (insertyourguihere) to defaults and see what that does.  If you had a highly customized desktop or something like that bear in mind you will lose your desktop tweaks and it will be back to where you started to build from.  Guessing one of the unity/gnome kidz may answer that better.....\n", "Q: no partition after installing ubuntu I cannot boot back my windows 8 disk after Ubuntu install.\nI installed Ubuntu.

That is like powering down your car in the middle of a busy cross-road because you took a wrong turn.  (Just believe me: don't try this!)\nThe easiest way to solve this situation is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable UEFI in the BIOS and reboot.\n\n*If that didn't work, take the recovery DVD that came with your machine and boot with that to get your system back.  Warning this will destroy all of your data still remaining on the drive. (You did make a back-up before starting the install didn't you?)\n\n\nThe more difficult way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach your back-up drive to the computer\n\n*Boot with the Ubuntu LiveCD\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\ntestdisk\n\n\n*Follow  testdisk step-by-step instructions to save as much of your data as possible.\n\n*Recover using the Recovery DVD\n\n*Follow these instructions on how to efficiently partition a Windows-Ubuntu dual-boot and how to install Ubuntu on a pre-installed Windows 8 machine.\n\n", "Q: No dual-boot available after installation of Ubuntu 14.10 alongside Windows After I completed the installation of Ubuntu alongside Windows I don't get the option for dual boot, it boots straight to Windows.

I partitioned my HDD, created a bootable USB, and the installer just doesn't detect Win7. I wish I could give more information, but I feel like I've tried so many things and I simply can't think of what else to say. =/ I figured you guys could just walk me through it seeing as I can't seem to get it on my own. Please and thanks.\nEDIT: I should mention that I've installed Ubuntu on this same machine before. No hardware has changed, but a while ago I ended up formatting my drive and had to reinstall Windows 7. When I installed Ubuntu last time, I ran into no issues. The install went incredibly smooth compared to this. To my knowledge, the software on it currently is also exactly the same. I simply have no clue where to even start at this point.\nUPDATE: I've stumbled upon the disks menu. Not sure how I didn't think of this before. Anyways, it's showing the partitions there just fine. First 2 are Windows parts. System reserve and the rest of the Windows files respectively. The 3rd one is empty and formatted as HPFS/NTFS.\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk -l -u /dev/sda\n\nWARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sda'! The util fdisk doesn't support GPT.

Open a terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t and type sudo os-prober This will try to detect installed operating systems on the hard drive. Next you could open GParted from the menu and see if it detects Windows, It should be a NTFS partition, take note of the name, should be something like sda. Go back to a Terminal and type sudo mount /dev/\"name of Windows partition here\" EX: sudo mount/dev/sda1.\nHopefully this will mount your Windows partition. If it still does not detect windows for the install along side option but Gparted does, Then you can choose the \"something else option and manually partition Ubuntu then install. Please note that you may have to reduce or split the Windows partition to make free space to play with. \n", "Q: Is it possible to update the sound options after boot?

cannot test currently if this works without rebooting.\nSo you could give a try to this\nby Jochen Voss at http://www.seehuhn.de/pages/alsa:\n\nIs ALSA present in your kernel?\nCheck for the presence of a /proc/asound/ directory. If the directory exists, you have ALSA support in your kernel.\n\n... \n\nWhat sound cards are known to the system?\nCheck the contents of the /proc/asound/cards file. Each entry there corresponds to a (real or simulated) sound card. On my system I\n  get the following:\n 0 [VirMIDI        ]: VirMIDI - VirMIDI\n                      Virtual MIDI Card 1\n 1 [V8237          ]: VIA8237 - VIA 8237\n                      VIA 8237 with ALC850 at 0x1000, irq 21\n 2 [Revolution51   ]: ICE1724 - M Audio Revolution-5.1\n                      M Audio Revolution-5.1 at 0xb800, irq 16\n 3 [system         ]: USB-Audio - iMic USB audio system\n                      Griffin Technology, Inc iMic USB audio ...\n\n\n...\n\nWhat features do these sound cards have?\nThere are several ways to find out. For example /proc/asound/devices contains an entry for every component of every\n  device ALSA knows about. For the system described above I get\n  0: [ 0]   : control\n  1:        : sequencer\n  8: [ 0- 0]: raw midi\n  9: [ 0- 1]: raw midi\n 10: [ 0- 2]: raw midi\n 11: [ 0- 3]: raw midi\n 32: [ 1]   : control\n 33:        : timer\n 48: [ 1- 0]: digital audio playback\n 49: [ 1- 1]: digital audio playback\n 56: [ 1- 0]: digital audio capture\n 57: [ 1- 1]: digital audio capture\n 64: [ 2]   : control\n 80: [ 2- 0]: digital audio playback\n 81: [ 2- 1]: digital audio playback\n 82: [ 2- 2]: digital audio playback\n 88: [ 2- 0]: digital audio capture\n\n\n...\n\nHow do I set the default device?\nCreate a configuration file (either for the whole system at /etc/asound.conf or .asoundrc in your home directory) containing\n  statements like the following ones:\ndefaults.ctl.card 1\ndefaults.pcm.card 1\ndefaults.timer.card 1\n\nThis file would make card 1 the default. The card number (1 in this example) is taken from the /proc/asound/cards file.

What is MAC spoofing in the internet connections and does it have any benefit in terms of security?\nWhat is the purpose of cloning the mac or spoofing it?\nDoes it help protect against hackers at all?\n\nA: MAC spoofing is what you do when you tell your NIC (Network Interface Card, which can be wireless too) to use a different address for communication on the local network (the segment before the first router).\nThis MAC address is not (at least with IPv4) visible on the outside, so you will not gain any security from spoofing it.\nThe main reason for spoofing the MAC address is that some ISPs tie their equipment to one MAC address (sometimes they don't want to allow several computer within your network) - in that case you can advertise the MAC-address already registered with them from another system.\nThe second reason for using it: Owners of WiFi-systems often restrict access to their system to some \"whitelisted\" MAC addresses. In that case it is possible but illegal to use a spoofed MAC address to gain access to that WiFi.\n\nA: Mac addresses can be useful in setting up certain network configurations. Mac addresses are individual to devices, ie network cards and can be used to filter allowed connections in a network.\nOne example of use would be in the use of a WAP. A WAP can be setup to rebroadcast, or repeat the information from another WAP, typically identified to each other by their individual Mac Addresses.\nIf you set your wireless devices up to only accept connections from white listed mac addresses, it is possible to use “spoofing” to gain a connection to your router anyways, but would require that the individual have identified one of the mac addresses which are white listed ahead of time.\nYou can find more information on this topic here: https://perot.me/mac-spoofing-what-why-how-and-something-about-coffee\n", "Q: Wifi connection I have a Toshiba Satellite s50d-A-10f and have installed Ubuntu on it.

The laptop uses an Atheros AR956x wireless adapter.\n\nA: If you have an Ethernet cable, please connect to your modem with it. In order to find the IP address of your modem, please open up a terminal and enter route -n and then look for an entry in the column Gateway. You can then open up a browser and navigate to the modem's settings and \n\n\n*\n\n*Check whether the password is indeed the one you are typing.\n\n*Check whether you have selected the right type of security type.\n\n\nEDIT:\nYou can always do that procedure with another PC, given that it is connected to the internet through that modem.\n\nA: Do you sure you have a correct password?\nMaybe you can turn on a access point via your phone and set a simple password like 12345678 and see if you can connect the phone's access point.\nI think you may have a wrong password or just type it wrong.\n", "Q: Hot-key support for second language on LibreOffice After using my new Ubuntu for the first few months without looking for problems, I'm starting to try and tweak some things that would make my life easier. \nRunning Ubuntu 14.04, when I switch to Hebrew - which was set as the second language when I bought the computer - all the regular hot keys such as ctrl-z, ctrl-c, ctrl-v stop working and I have to switch to En do what I need to do, then switch back to He and continue working.

It works but, when I run the command  it generates warnings ( Wnck-WARNING **: Unhandled action type). I think the tool might be designed to run under GNOME and might not be compatible with Lubuntu. The screenshot is taken successfully, but the command hangs, which is something I cannot work with.\nSo what is a good screenshot tool that \n\n\n*\n\n*Runs from the command line\n\n*Can capture a certain area of the desktop\n\n\n\nI like to add that scrot, the tool Lubuntu ships with, does not have the option to crop certain coordinates, but only an interactively user-defined area which is not what I'm looking for.\n\nA: In Lubuntu, you can do exactly what you want: take a screen shot from the command line with the command:\nscrot_extended 100 100 400 400\n\nusing the script below.\nThe four arguments are <x>, <y>, <width>, <height>.\nI didn't have the chance (yet) to test it in Lubuntu 12.04, but it seems unlikely it wouldn't work; it uses python 2 and basic command line tools that exist for a long time already.\nExplanation\nThe script:\n\n*\n\n*takes a screenshot with scrot\n\n*saves it into a temporary file\n\n*using imagemagick, it creates a new image, cropping the screen shot, with the arguments you ran the script with\n\n*the image is saved into a directory as a numbered file, to prevent overwriting\n\nHow to use\n\n*\n\n*The script uses both scrot and imagemagick. scrot should be on your system. To install imagemagick:\n sudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file\n\n\n*By default, images are saved to ~/scrot_images, named: outputfile_1.png, outputfile_2.png etc. . Change it if you want, as marked in the script. Note that if you change the diretory, you have to use the full path.\n\n\n*Save the file to ~/bin (create the directory if needed) as scrot_extended (no extension) and make it executable.\n\n\n*Log out and back in and take your screenshot with the command:\n scrot_extended <x> <y> <width> <height>\n\nExample:\nscrot_extended 100 100 400 400\n\n\noutputfile:\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport sys\n# setting default directories / filenames\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ntemp = home+\"/\"+\".scrot_images\"\nimg_in = temp+\"/in.png\"\n# if you prefer, you can change the two line below:\noutput_directory = home+\"/\"+\"scrot_images\" # output directory\nfilename = \"outputfile\"                    # filename\n# creating needed directories\nfor dr in [temp, output_directory]:\n    if not os.path.exists(dr):\n        os.mkdir(dr)\n# creating filename (-number) to prevent overwriting previous shots\nn = 1\nwhile True:\n    img_out = output_directory+\"/\"+filename+\"_\"+str(n)+\".png\"\n    if os.path.exists(img_out):\n        n = n+1\n    else:\n        break\n# reading arguments,arranging commands to perform\ncoords = sys.argv[1:5]\ncmd1 = [\"scrot\", img_in]\ncmd2 = [\"convert\", img_in, \"-crop\", coords[2]+\"x\"+coords[3]+\"+\"+coords[0]+\"+\"+coords[1], \"+repage\", img_out]\n# Take screnshot, crop image\nfor cmd in [cmd1, cmd2]:\n    subprocess.call(cmd)\n\n\nA: Using maim\n\nOverview\nmaim (make image) is a new screenshot utility that is designed as an improved version of scrot. \nOne of the many new features maim comes with is the support for setting a screen capture area right from the CLI. The syntax works as follows:\nmaim -x <x-coordinate> -y <y-coordinate> -w <width> -h <height>\n\ne.g.:\nmaim -x 100 -y 100 -w 400 -h 400\n\nInstallation\nmaim hasn't arrived in the official repositories, yet, and isn't part of any PPA, either. You will have to compile it from source in order to install it.\nAfter making sure that all dependencies are satisfied...\nsudo apt-get install build-essential cmake\nsudo apt-get install libimlib2-dev libxrandr-dev libxfixes-dev\n\n...we can proceed with the actual compilation and installation:\ngit clone https://github.com/naelstrof/maim.git\ncd maim\ncmake ./\nmake && sudo make install\n\nThat's it. You should now be able to call maim from your terminal. Please make sure to check out the documentation (maim --help) for all available options; and check out slop, a utility by the same developer that allows you to interactively select the area of the screen capture.\n\nA: The current version of scrot does have the ability to screenshot a defined rectangle off the screen.  \nscrot --autoselect '1,2,3,4'  outfile.png # screenshot the rectangle at 1,2 with 3 width and 4 height\nNaturally, you would replace 1,2 with the x,y pixel coordinates of the rectangle you want.  So x,y would be the upper left pixel of the rectangle you desire. \nalso see this answer for instructions on how to get the current mouse coordinates from a bash script\n\nA: There is an easier way to do this using maim than with the accepted answer of scrot_extended. There is an answer  on how to take fixed-size screenshots in maim which is outdated now.\nmaim allows you to specify the geometry using the geometry(g) flag. As referred to in the documentation:\n -g, --geometry=GEOMETRY\n              Sets the region to capture, uses local coordinates from the given\n              window. So -g 10x30-5+0 would represent the rectangle wxh+x+y where\n              w=10, h=30, x=-5, and y=0. x and y are the upper left location of this rectangle.\n\nUsage:\nmaim -g <w>x<h>+<x>+<y> <output-file>\n\nExample:\nmaim -g 1024x1024+10+20 ~/test.png\n\n\nA: Bind a bash script that implements scrot and imagemagick to a keyboard shortcut\nThis does nearly the same thing as Jacob Vlijm's answer but with bash. It names files using a timestamp to avoid overwriting existing files. It also allows you to define default cropping parameters in the script so you're not required to call it with any parameters.\nCall the script below as follows (assuming you're in the directory where the script is stored, otherwise the full path to the script is required):\n\n*\n\n*With parameters: ./screenshot.sh $left_px $top_px $width_px $height_px OR\n\n*Without parameters: ./screenshot.sh in which case, the default parameters specified in the script are used.\n\n1) Install the necessary applications\nFrom the command line, run:\nsudo apt install scrot imagemagick\n\n2) Create the script\nOpen your text editor of choice and create a new plaintext file with the following contents. Be sure the modify the variables at the top to specify where you want the images saved and what portion of the screen you want to crop out. See this trick for getting mouse coordinates which can be used to find left and top and to calculate width and height.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Change these values to match your preferences\nimageQuality=100    # scrot default is 75\nscreenshotDir=\"/tmp\"    # directory in which to save screenshots\nimageName=\"$(date +%Y-%m-%d.%H:%M:%S.%N).jpg\"   # save image names as timestamp\ndefault_left=10     # begin crop this number of pixels from the left of the image\ndefault_top=10      # begin crop this number of pixels from the top of the image \ndefault_width=100   # crop this many pixels wide\ndefault_height=100  # crop this many pixels tall\n\n#Do not make any more changes from here down unless you know what you're doing\nl=$1; t=$2; w=$3; h=$4\nleft=${l:=$default_left}\ntop=${t:=$default_top}\nwidth=${w:=$default_width}\nheight=${h:=$default_height}\nimagePath=\"$screenshotDir/$imageName\"\n\n[ ! -d \"$screenshotDir\" ] && mkdir -p \"$screenshotDir\"\nscrot -q $imageQuality \"$imagePath\"\nconvert \"$imagePath\" -crop ${width}x${height}+${left}+${top} \"$imagePath\"\n\nSave this script wherever you like and make it executable.

I want to no longer use that ppa and want to now use the same packages from Ubuntu standard repos. If I purge it (e.g. using Y PPA Manager), I presume that will result in the removal of these packages. Would it automatically replace them with the ones from the Ubuntu standard repos. If not, how do I do this?\nPS I have Synaptic installed.\n\nA: Yes, using ppa-purge will replace all the packages from that ppa with the most current default packages from the Ubuntu repos.\nThe \"Y PPA Manager\" just makes it easy to find the ppa as you don't have to try to type the name into the command line, it still calls ppa-purge while running.\nBe PATIENT while running the program, it can take a while to complete each step.  While each step is running, it will seem like the purge is frozen.  DO NOT kill the program or shut your computer down while it is running, while it should still be possible to fix after a partial purge, it will be a major headache and is best avoided.  For a large ppa, the time to complete could be 10+ minutes.  Longer if you have a slow internet connection, as all the packages will have to be downloaded. \nAs to the title of your question \"How do I\"  I would recommend the \"Y PPA Manager\"  other wise you will need to type `ppa-purge ppa:{name of ppa here} so you must know the exact name to do it by terminal.

Check if you have been successful by running ifconfig to see if the alias has been set. Then, it would be recommended to ping the hosts you are trying to connect on the two local networks to make sure everything runs as expected.\n", "Q: Why can't I rename folders on my Android device from my Ubuntu interface?

I want to pass lossless audio to my AVR for decoding - I don't need my HTPC to decode anything.\nNone of the tutorials or walk-thrus I've found have worked and I'm about to completely give up on Ubuntu and Linux in general out of frustration. I've tried a little over a dozen so far and am on my 6th fresh Ubuntu install. \n\nA: To enable audio passthrough from Ubuntu running PulseAudio and Kodi we need to make several settings:\nUsing Pulse Audio\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable passthrough for our audio output device\nThis is done using pavucontrol  where we can enable passtrough in advanced settings for our digital output through HDMI, or S/PDIF resp.:\n\n\nThe profile used for our audio devices is defined in the Configuration tab.\nFor passthough mode we need to set pulseaudio to 2.0 channels.\n\n*Enable audio passthrough from Kodi system audio output settings: \n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a digital output device (HDMI or S/PDIF) in the output configuration\n\n*Tick enable passthrough  \n\n*Select which output device to use in case there are more than one\n\n*Tick what encodings our AVR is capable of decoding\n\n\n\nPlease note that S/PDIF is only capable of providing 5.1. audio. For 7.1. audio we'd need a HDMI connection.\nFor further limitations on using Pulse Audio for passthrough and for indepth additional hints read the great tutorial from the Kodi team. There you will also find an extremely helpful table for setting to be made under various conditions.\nUsing ALSA\nSadly Pulse Audio currently does not support passthrough of DTS-HD or TrueHD audio. To get this working we therefore can not use Pulse Audio as a sound server for Kodi.\n\n\n*\n\n*We need to start Kodi with ALSA instead (AE_SINK=ALSA kodi).\n\n*To avoid unwanted side effects with Pulse Audio it is recommended to remove it completely, or suspend it using pauspender before starting Kodi.\n\n*Both can be achieved by a startup script for Kodi:\n#! /bin/bash\n\npasuspender\nAE_SINK=ALSA kodi\n\n\n*In case we always want to start Kodi with ALSA and to always suspend Pulse Audio just link to this script in our kodi.desktop file giving the full path to the (executable) script in its Exec line. \n\n*Then the passthrough device will point to the ALSA device:\n\n\nA: Thanks for the tip, I have always used ALSA, (removed pulseaudio) \nbut this is problematic because I have no sound outside of Kodi. I tried to use the ALSA sink when running pulse audio. This works but it have the side effect on my setup, that I can't figure out. I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. It is hooked up to a AVR that support DTS ma etc.\nIf I run the AE_SINK=ALSA kodi from the terminal or use it in a .desktop file it works perfectly pushing the dts-ma out to the AVR, even when pulse audio is the default. This is good :)\nThe problem I am facing is in conjunction with xautomation and lirc\nMy setup is a bit complex because I use a harmony to control everything.\nThis is extremely smart, because it makes it wife proof :) she can't hit one button and both TV, AVR, PC, speakers start on the correct channels. and she can control a fully fledged PC as was it a smart TV.\nSIMEREC pcs2 is installed in the media center to control on/of via hw switch. But from within Ubuntu it uses xautomation and lirc to make things happen. \nThis add the feature to script everything like starting Kodi, closing Kodi, navigation in the system. Because this is its own service, if something freezes or crashes, with a push of one button Kodi is force closed and started again. you can also force restart the desktop environment, but this is rarely a problem. I have used this setup since LTS 12.04 \nThe side effect I am experiencing is when I set the parameter AE_SINK=ALSA kodi on the .desktop file or I the startup script and uses xautomation to execute it. This makes irexec crash. When I try to restart irexec -d the service don't start.

What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I'm going to guess that is a command you copied from a website or something like that, because that dash in front of the i is not a hyphen (or minus), but an en-dash:\n$ od -c <<<\"–\"\n0000000 342 200 223  \\n\n0000004\n$ od -c <<<\"-\"\n0000000   -  \\n\n0000002\n\nUse a proper - instead.\nAnd don't use dpkg unless you need to; the Software Centre can handle .deb files just fine, just double click on the file, or do xdg-open google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb.\n", "Q: How do I use MAAS to deploy CentOS images? Can anyone point to the the right direction to deploy CentOS images with MAAS? I found a command to upload images but end to end deployment is quite obscure.\nThere seems to be a gap in the documentation and a short tutorial would be really nice.\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nA: I thought I would share the answer I found, thanks to this post on travnewmatic.com:\nOnce CentOS images are generated one should import them using the api after login:\nmaas root boot-resources create name=centos/centos6 title=\"CentOS-6\" architecture=amd64/generic  content@=centos6-amd64-root-tgz\n\nBuilder script seems to be the way to go. Analyzing it, I tried to to use directly CentOS cloud images with populated curtin directory and virt-sysprep but with no success (installation of image doesn't complete correctly an MAAS node is stuck in deployment). I would need to spend more time to look at what is wrong with this approach as it would be more efficient.\nNote that I recommend to modify the builder script and contrib kickstart configuration file to speed up image creation. Using kernel.org mirror lead to image creation failure... Instead, using near by mirror lead to image creation success with reasonable speed on homemade 32 GB RAM server.\n\nA: With MAAS 2.0, this is really easy: CentOS images are included in the stock configuration! Just go to the Images tab, choose the checkboxes by CentOS 6 and/or 7, and choose Apply Changes.\nNote that MAAS 2.0 is the default MAAS stack in Ubuntu 16.04, but is still a release candidate (2.0 RC4) as of Aug 10th 2016.\nIf you are running a MAAS 2.0 RC and don't see these images as an option, make sure your image sync URL (in the Settings tab) is set to https://images.maas.io/ephemeral-v2/daily/. (The .../release/ image source doesn't have CentOS images yet, but presumably will when 2.0 final is released).\n\nA: So the current MAAS version that loads as the default version under Ubuntu 16.04 is not MAAS version 2.1.3.  \n2.1.3 does include image support by default for Centos 6.6 and Centos 7.  I have tested Centos 6.6, and it works great, just be sure you have your ssh public key loaded first, and login using the user \"centos\" and your provate key that pairs with the above mentioned public key.\nHowever when I test the Centos 7 image, I found that the Centos 7 network ports are disabled by default on first boot and must be enabled at the console during install (or by script, which is failing in MAAS 2.1.3), and the MAAS deploy scripts may need to be updated to resolve this.  There is no obvious way to turn the ethernet ports on, I can't even break in to see what's going wrong in the scripts.  So Centos 6.6 is what works now, as of 5/11/17.  I have another question open on the Centos 7 issue, so I will update that thread once I get a working Centos 7 running.\n", "Q: Chrome remote desktop for Linux I am trying to install Chrome Remote Desktop to my Linux machine so I can remote in from another computer. I have done this before on many other machines including on Windows and Mac; both of which worked exactly as one would expect.\nHowever, when I go to install the Chrome Remote Desktop Host installer on Linux it downloads fine, then it opens in the software center and says:\n\nThe package is of bad quality\n  The installation of a package which violates the quality standards isn't allowed. This could >cause serious problems on your computer.

It seems to install, but when I go back to the tab in my Chrome browser that has the info about setting up the remote access it tells me it will work after I install the Chrome Remote Desktop Host installer. Which I just did.\nHas anyone found a solution to this?\n\nA: I just tried reinstalling it and it just worked. I didn't change anything.\nMaybe there was an update to the installer?\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on RAID with LVM, failed to boot I've installed Ubuntu on RAID-5 with LVM and made a /boot partition but it failed to boot. Can anyone help or point to a resource describing the process?\nUpdate: I decided to re-install the OS.\nThis question is no longer relevant. \n\nA: Ubuntu can't boot from a software raid in my experience. You need to create a non-raid partition to install GRUB to. Format the partition as fat32 and set boot flag.\n", "Q: lubuntu strange graphics I have just installed a fresh lubuntu 14.10. I have this graphics bug:\n\nAfter this I installed the NVidia drivers, but nothing changed.\nThen I installed the Intel drivers, still nothing.\nI have both integrated and dedicated graphics card driver up-to-date now.\n\nA: I don't think this is a graphics bug, I think the theme you're using is providing a texture that has a vertical gradient and it applies nicely to the taskbar but clearly not the notifications. I suggest trying another theme or editing this one.\n", "Q: Switch between themes in Ubuntu 14.04 I installed Mint and Ubuntu MATE themes to my computer.\nUbuntu MATE was my final theme installation. \nNow I have Ubuntu MATE on my computer. \nBut I want to switch into Mint theme.\nThe log in screen used to let me to change the theme, but now there is no button for it.\nI think Ubuntu Mate doesn't support that button, and I'm stuck in the Mate Theme.\nCan someone tell me how to switch between themes? It's better if the solution is through the terminal.\n\nA: Go to Menu  -  System Settings  -  Appearance - Themes and choose the theme.\nIf you want to call login screen press Ctlr+ Alt + Del.\n\nA: Download Unity Tweak Tool (sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool)  and it will allow you to change themes, as well as mix themes and window button appearance\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop on RAID-5 with LVM, GRUB failed to install I want to configure a home media center and file storage, to keep the data safe I want to use RAID-5 (I have 4 HDs) and LVM for future scaling.\nI've configured RAID-5 and LVM, but GRUB installation failed.\nI booted from live CD and activated the RAID, found the LVM volumes.\nHow can I install GRUB and where should it be? In the LVM or the raid volume md0 itself? \n\nA: I've found the problem.\nI read that GRUB can be placed inside the LVM and that it is somehow possible, however with the lack of proper documentation I DO NOT recommend trying this. That is what caused the problem, placing GRUB inside LVM volume on RAIeD-5.\nTo fix this, all you need to do is write GRUB to the regular HD's, outside of the RAID partitions. You can do this be \"chroot\"ing, but I have found an easier way:\nBoot from Live CD, and make sure you have internet connection, then:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair -y\nsudo boot-repair\n\nThis will launch a GUI repair tool, follow the instructions carefully and it will re-install GRUB for you.\nThe lesson is do not place GRUB in an LVM volume upon installation, choose one of the hard drives, outside the RAID partitions i.e. /sda, /sdb/, etc...\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: 'xte mousedown' / '-up' via xbindkeys not working I would like to bind my (Logitech mouse, thumb button) b:2 to the middle mouse button button 2.\nI tried\n \"xte 'mouseclick 2'\"\n   b:8\n\nwhich does work in the terminal, but not with xbindkeys.\nNeither does the following trigger any action, which is what I actually planned to do:\n \"xte 'mousedown 2'\"\n   b:8\n \"xte 'mouseup 2'\"\n   b:8 + release\n\nI can, however, send keystrokes as \"xte 'keydown A'\" using xbindkeys without any problems.

Otherwise, no (use the 32 bit, sometimes aka x86) version instead.  Figuring out if you have a 32 bit or 64 bit CPU depends on the current operating system you have loaded.  From Ubuntu you can press Ctrl-Alt-T and run the command lscpu; under CPU op-mode(s) it will say 32-bit, 64-bit or at least 64-bit if your CPU is 64 bit.  Regardless, you can put in the install CD/DVD you have and boot from the disk to boot into Ubuntu without doing anything to your computer's hard drive.  If the amd64 boot disk you have doesn't seem to work, that is probably telling and you can download the x86 boot disk.\nAlso see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the 64-Bit version of Ubuntu only compatible with AMD CPUs?\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/questions/297254/do-i-have-the-correct-iso-file/297263#297263\n\n*Difference between the i386 download and the amd64?\n...as being related and possibly duplicate...\n", "Q: Ubuntu Phones for the US Will there be Ubuntu Phones for the Ubuntu users of the US?

I believe these settings are responsible for the dimming and going out after a short period of time.\n", "Q: How would I go about installing Windows 8? I purchased this laptop a year or so ago and immediately switched to Ubuntu since it was faster and did everything that I needed it for faster. \nExcept now I would like to dual boot, but can't figure how to hell to run a program to install Windows 8 on a different partition. I don't have the code itself (it's tied to the motherboard), and MS has removed the option for a bootable Win 8 disk. Every other executable I've found (even trying to get Win7 through less than proper means) doesn't work on Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you have a recovery disk that came with your laptop, you should be able to boot from it by hitting F12 when your laptop first boots, and choose it as a boot device, and then from there, install windows. \nIf you have an iso for a windows installation, then you can burn that to a disk, or a USB, (instructions can be found here http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu) and then choose that at boot. I've never installed windows, but I assume you can choose a partition to install it on.\nAfter you install windows, you will likely need to use boot-repair to allow dual-boot (http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/) and burn this to a usb or CD as well, boot from it preferably legacy boot since it allows you a nice GUI to edit settings, and run boot-repair off the desktop if it doesn't start automatically, use the recommended fix and after that finishes, reboot and allow ubuntu to boot, and there should be a new menu with Ubuntu at the top and your windows installation at the bottom. \nIssues: If your screen goes black after running boot-repair, its likely you need to have nomodeset on, which can be done while booting. Hit f6 and navigate to nomodeset and hit enter. Then hit escape and try booting. \nEDIT: If you have any questions, issues, or want me to go into further detail on some of the steps, let me know. I might just give you a link where the steps or issues are explained much better than I could explain them\n", "Q: Can't write accent characters in Ubuntu 14.04 Alright. This is the scenery that I got:\n1) I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n2) I am using an american (international) keyboard\n3) OS is in the following language: Portuguese Brazil (brazilian portuguese)\n4) I am a new user of Linux. I am almost 30 years old and I have been using Windows for my WHOLE life, so I don't know NOTHING about how to configure or set Linux/Ubuntu.\n5) I've JUST installed this OS for the first in my notebook. \n6) Every letter that I try to write with an accent comes like in the examples above: \n\n\n*\n\n*'a (when the correct should be á)\n\n*'c (when the correct should be ç)\n\n*~a (when the correct should be ã)\n\n*^o (when the correct should be ô)\nCould please someone tell me how do I fix this?\nThank you all!\n\nA: (I do not know Brazilian portuguese.) The name of the feature you are trying to use is \"dead keys\". A dead key is chosen so that it has a label which is similar to an accent and when it pressed it does not create a new letter, you have to press a second key too. Some combination results in the accented version of the second letter. \nThere are more than one builtin keyboard layouts in Ubuntu even for a single language. As I see there are five for your language:\n\n\n*\n\n*Portuguese (Brazil)\n\n*Portuguese (Brazil, Dvorak)\n\n*Portuguese (Brazil, eliminate dead keys)\n\n*Portuguese (Brazil, Nativo)\n\n*Portuguese (Brazil, Nativo for US keyboards)\n\n\nYou have to choose either of 1, 4, 5. You can also choose the US international layout with dead keys, which seems to be popular among Brazilians:\n\n\n*English (US, international with dead keys)\n\n\nYou can add a new layout by\n\n\n*\n\n*clicking on the input source (keyboard language layout) switcher near the right end of the panel to show the popup menu \n\n*selecting Text Entry Settings from the menu\n\n*Pressing the plus button below the Input sources to use list.\n\n\nBy the way, there is a keyboard icon on the right of the  plus button which displays the chosen layout.\nIf you have more than one keyboard layout in your Input sources to use list, then you can switch them by either clicking on the input source icon on the profile or pressing Super + Space.\nFor example, if I select  Portuguese (Brazil) I can type the letter á by pressing the English keys [a in sequence.\nAs usual, each of the things I mentioned above can be customized.\n\nA: What Hontvári Levente said is right, but one need to test each keyboard layout in order to achieve the desired result.\nIn Ubuntu 20.04 press Super (Windows) key -> search for keyboard -> open it -> Layout tab -> in 'keyboard layout' section, change the layout. For me, I needed to remove all other layouts in order to work.\nOn my Acer laptop, Brazilian keyboard (...,j,k,l,ç,~,],enter), I selected:\nlayout: Portuguese (Brazil)\nVariant: Portuguese (Brazil, IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad)\n\n*\n\n*Try first your native language/ all variants before move to others languages;\n\n*Check you country (Brazilian Portuguese is different from European Portuguese);\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. Solved it reinstalling ibus:\nsudo apt install --reinstall ibus\n\nYou may need to do a full purge and then reinstall:\nsudo apt purge ibus && sudo apt install ibus \n\n", "Q: Attempted to move home folder back to original ext4 partition and now can't start session When I initially installed Ubuntu a couple years ago (12.04), I was dual-booting and made the mistake of moving my home directory to an NTFS partition. I later discovered this was why pulseaudio didn't work, so I had no sound. Everything else worked fine, though, so I never messed with it.  \nI've since upgraded to 14.10 and decided it was time to fix the sound.  The home folder contains way too much stuff to fit on my ext4 partition, so I figured I'd just leave it there, mount it to /media/whatever , and just have an empty home folder on the ext4 partition, that only contains things that Ubuntu and other programs put there by default.\nSo, I deleted the /home mounting line in my fstab and rebooted.  Now I get \"can't start session\" error when I try to log in.  I went in to /home in the file system, the empty one on the ext partition.

I am currently attempting to recover my files before I reformat the Windows OS on my C: drive. That said, I am booting from a USB using Ubuntu and am in the \"trial\" version (just trying it without installing it).\nI do not see my hard drive or the drive that would presumably be my C: drive in Windows when I look through the devices. I am not sure where my files may be but I am fairly certain they have not been deleted or formatted over.\nI am strictly looking for ways to recover the files to an external drive and not so much how to dual boot or permanently install Ubuntu.\n\nA: Assigning letters to drives is the traditional way of addressing hard drives and partitions in the user interface for DOS, Windows and related operating systems. Other operating systems have different naming schemes:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the Linux drive naming scheme? (Also read the answer by Joel Coehoorn)\n\n\nUsually, Ubuntu running in a live session environment is capable of mounting Microsoft filesystems like FAT and NTFS. The filesystems should be available for mounting in the filemanager or be automatically mounted already. It should be easy to find the right filesystem when they were labeled accordingly, otherwise you have to guess by size, remember the position of the partition in a partition manager or dumb trial an error. Typically external filesystems are mounted below /media.\nIn some cases you may no be able to mount a certain filesystem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unable to mount Windows (NTFS) filesystem due to hibernation\n\n*Proprietary full disk encryption like Bitlocker with or without TPM.\n\n\n*\n\n*Truecrypt volumes and system partitions with pre-boot authentication can be decrypted with Truecrypt for Linux or dm-crypt.\n\n\n\nA: Your \"C\" drive will be located /media/<possibly_a_long_series_of numbers>\nUse your file manager (Nautilus), go up(down) to root (/) and then into /media, and you will see it.  \nIt is possible there might be ownership/permission problems in manipulating the files within this directory, or transferring them to an external, but just open it/them as root.\n", "Q: How to install ImageMagick on Ubuntu 12.04?

I can get the text log in and get in that way but don't seem to have permissions to do anything. \ntried to run ls -la .Xauthority and get ls: cannot access .Xauthority: No such file or directory.\n \n\nA: Solution\nYou have altered permissions to your home folder. To change the permissions back, login into the text console ,Ctrl+Alt+F2 (or any other F key from 1 to 6 ), then loginn as root with sudo su and do chmod 755 ~/\nExplanation\nIn the original command that you ran there is space between ~/ and /Amazon/qwiklab-133-5018.pem. Shell treats them at two separate arguments to chmod command. You have effectively changed permissions on your home folder to 600, which is read/write permissions to only yourself. You can confirm the permissions to your home folder by loging in with sudo su and doing ls -l /home/yourusername. Replace yourusername with your actual user name. you should see line like this -rw------- there.\nThe reason why you couldn't log in graphically, is because the graphical log-in screen, the greeter, would need to read configs in your home folder, to set up the graphical environment. Ctrl+Alt+F4 , which is just text interface environment, doesn't need such configs. That's why you are able to login there.\n", "Q: why installing a new application in linux is so complex..? Why installing or uninstalling a new application in linux is so complex? why there is no installer like windows installer which would help users without prior knowledge about linux command line (like me) to install new programs..?\n\nA: If you aren't used to something it doesn't mean it is more complex.\nIn fact installing under Ubuntu is easier! \nBy default package management is held by Ubuntu Software Center where you install an application with one click on Install button instead of Next - Next - Install - OK in Windows OS.\n\nA: Actually Linux makes it a lot easier to install software. The problem is that most people are so hung up (used to) the Microsoft way that they find hard to install it on Linux. \nMost Linux distros give you a repository of applications that you can install at the tip of you fingers. You can use command line commands to download and install from repos, the software center (gui interface for repos), distro specific packages (like deb or rpm) that can be installed via command line or by double clicking on them, source packages that can be compiled and installed, other user's repos (like ppa for Ubuntu), and more. \nAgain, it's not that is hard to install, is just that most people are not familiar with it.\nKeep at it and ask the right questions. You only have to gain from it. \n\nA: If you are referring to using package managers [either terminal or GUI], then it is fairly easy.\nIf you are referring to compiling software from source, then that is a bit more complex but you will find it easier.\nYou will find both easier as time goes on.\n", "Q: Alfa AWUS036NH not showing up on Ubuntu 14.04 When I type lsusb I get this as a result:\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:8000 Intel Corp. \nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 002: ID 0bda:56ff Realtek Semiconductor Corp. \nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 005: ID 5986:0548 Acer, Inc \nBus 002 Device 004: ID 0483:91d1 STMicroelectronics \nBus 002 Device 003: ID 8087:07dc Intel Corp. \nBus 002 Device 002: ID 1b96:0f04 N-Trig \nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n\nI dont think it is registering the adapter even though its plugged in.

Now I am going to try to install Plasma 5 on top of this to see if it works.\nBut a short answer is that the problem probably lies with Dropbox and Plasma 5.\nEDIT: If you install Dropbox on Plasma 4, the icon shows up in the dashboard below (in KDE), and Dropbox works fine. NOW if you install Plasma 5 on top of it using the instructions given on http://www.kubuntu.org/news/kubuntu-14.10, the Dropbox daemon works in the background and keep syncing stuff, BUT the icon is no longer visible in the notification area anymore. \nSo the problem now is: how does one restore the Dropbox icon in the notification area in Plasma 5 KDE?\n", "Q: md5sums are wrong on 2 downloads downloading a 3rd now md5sums have been wrong on 2 of my downloads of ubuntu Desktop, checked all sums on the page with software link ubuntu provided, what's up?\n\nA: Sounds like bad downloads.

I did select Erase all files and install at the splash screen as there was no other option for install (even though I had wiped the drive).\nAfter reading a post about Steam games not working in Star Sapphire I decided to try Ubuntu 14.04.1 as several forums suggested Steam works in Ubuntu.

I have a personal preference to at least 3 partitions (swap partition equivalent to RAM size; /, a root partition 10-30GB, depending; and the rest of the space devoted to /home)\n\n\nTypically,\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 = / (root)\n\n*/dev/sda2 = /home\n\n*/dev/sdaX = swap\n\n\nThe order and numerical sequence is more important the OCD you are.\nNow, after you have partitioned and formatted this unknown harddrive, check and mark any badblocks that might give you a bad day.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal <ctrl><alt><t> at the same time, and enter sudo badblocks -v /dev/sda > bad-blocks\nThis goes over the drive and notes any 'bad blocks' and writes the information to a file bad-blocks  in the current working directory (on the LiveCD).\n\n\n*\n\n*While it's churning away this is a good time to check if the machine is overheating.  Granted it's subjective, but does it feel hot?

Then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check how much space /root uses. Usually it should be less than 1MB. If you have anything larger in there, move it to your /home.\n\n*Check how much space /tmp uses. If it is more than a few MB, reboot your system. /tmp is cleared on every reboot but can fill up over time.\n\n*Check other folders such as /opt, and check if you put any large files there or if there are any large files that do not belong to a package. Some installers will install stuff into /opt and never remove it. Be careful when doing this.\n\n*Run sudo apt-get clean. That should remove a lot of stuff in the package cache. On my system running apt-get clean got rid of about 1.5GB of old downloaded packages that are not needed.\n\n*Reduce the size of the reserved space on /dev/sdb6. Usually 5% are reserved for the root user in case you fill up the system and need to log in as root user in an emergency. The default of 5% means 1GB on your system, you can safely reduce that to 1% (200MB) using tune2fs:\n$ sudo tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sda6\ntune2fs 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\nSetting reserved blocks percentage to 1%\n\n\n*Uninstall some packages using sudo apt-get remove. Small tip if you use LaTeX: One of the major space wasters is usually the texlive-full metapackage. It installs gigabytes worth of documentation and other stuff, although you usually don't need it all at once. Installing texlive instead will pull in just the minimum, and download the rest when it's needed.\n\nIf you are still running out of space, as an absolute last resort you can: \n\n\n*\n\n*Resize the /dev/sda6 partition (make it bigger) and shrink the /dev/sda7 partition using a Live CD and GParted. This could take a while and it's very easy to destroy your data, so you absolutely need to make a full backup beforehand. See this question for more detail about resizing partitions.\n\n\nI would recommend against this though, as 20GB should be plenty of space for most scenarios, and you there is a real chance of data loss when resizing partitions.\n", "Q: Force tabs redraw in chrome I use Ubuntu with XFCE4, after an update few weeks ago something has happened to my google-chrome (version>40), when i unminimize the window the title-bar/tab-bar does not redraw, here an example:\n\nIf i pass the mouse over a tab it re-appears\n\nThe only way to force title-bar redraw is to change tab or uniminize another window.\nHow can i solve this problem?\nEDIT:\nthis happen even on chromium.\n\nA: I cannot confirm the bug but my problem is similar to the one present in this report:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/1309801\nSOLUTION:\nrun chrome with the option:\n--disable-gpu-compositing\n\n\nA: Looks like this is a problem with the latest version of google chrome.\nThey probably know about it.

I'm not an expert but I'll share how I solved my problem. I have AMD processor and ati radeon 76xx HD video card btw.\nFirst I've installed fglrx drivers. You can easily find with a \"how can I install proprietary drivers for Linux NVIDIA/ATI\". That helped much, I couldn't even get 4 hours of battery life with windows now I have 6 hours of battery life and 38-40 degrees temperature in easy tasks.\nSecondly, you may want to try \"tlp power management tool\". I can't give the exact pathway to how, I'm writing from phone sorry:). That also helped, lowers 1-2 degrees average but increases battery life.\nYou may want to check other Linux websites, but I'm pretty sure that will work.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi connection problem with Qualcomm Atheros AR9285 adapter I've switched my HP Pavilion dv6 from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS several months ago and had no problems whatsoever connecting to the internet via wifi. However, about two days ago, connection speed started to fluctuate greatly or stop working altogether at times. Rebooting helped at first but now it's dead, nothing helps.

This hardware is based on an Application Specific Integrated Circuit or ASIC. There are different generations of ASICs that can do more in less time as they become more recent. \nIt is almost impossible to get any help in setting up a nvidia GPU based bitcoin miner because the folks that develop the software no longer support what they consider a unworthy configuration. You can get low end ASICs below $40.00, perhaps lower. I saw one on Alibaba for $25.00. These low end ASICs are built to plug into a USB hub or port. The simplest way to begin mining bitcoins would be to buy one or more of these USB ASICs and then use software like BFGMINER which can be found for windows, MAC, and Linux. \n", "Q: Unknow keyword in configuration file I think the configuration of isolinux.cfg is wrong.. \nI tried every solution here on \" ask! \" but all failed for me..\nI'm trying to install the ubuntu 14 with usb boot, i already got the iso file from ubuntu officil website, and the universal usb linux installer\n\n\nA: Instead of trying to fix an error which should not exist, better to check the Ubuntu Official hashes and to download the .iso file again.\nThis will be much easier and more robust then trying to fix it yourself and then finding something else somewhere else went wrong as well.  ;-)\n", "Q: USB File System: Unknown.

The one that is currently loaded. Open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and issue the following command \nuname -r\n\nIt will show you the loaded kernel, you should NOT try to remove this one. \nThen issue the command \nls /boot \n\nit will return all the installed images. Pick one or two and try to remove them. Try to force remove/purge them. \nFor example \nsudo dpkg --force-all -P linux-image-3.13.0-32-generic\n\nYou can do the same for other images, in order to free up some space. \nThen you can try to install the missing packages, or \nsudo apt-get install -f \n\nto try resolve the dependencies. \nFinally, issue the \"cleanup old kernels\" command \n sudo apt-get purge $(dpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-\"[0-9]*\" | awk '/ii/{print $2}' | grep -ve \"$(uname -r | sed -r 's/-[a-z]+//')\")\n\nAbove  command will remove ALL the kernels except the one that is currently loaded. \nBecause you have a separate /boot partition, keep in mind you will need to track its space and cleaning up often (the frequency depends on the space of /boot)\n\nA: This is what worked for me on Ubuntu 16.04.\nsudo apt autoremove --purge\nsudo apt autoremove\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: List all kernels:\ndpkg --list 'linux-image*'\n\nDisplay current kernel:\nuname -r\n\nList all kernels EXCEPT current one:\ndpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-\"[0-9]*\" | awk '/^ii/{ print $2}' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut -f1,2 -d\"-\"` | grep -e '[0-9]'\n\nMake sure your current kernel isn't on that list.\nRemove all kernels EXCEPT current one:\ndpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-\"[0-9]*\" | awk '/^ii/{ print $2}' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut -f1,2 -d\"-\"` | grep -e '[0-9]' | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\nClear other stuff:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nIf it stills throws any error then repeat following commands to remove unwanted kernels,\nsudo dpkg --purge linux-image-X.X.X-XXX-generic linux-image-extra-X.X.X-XXX-generic linux-signed-image-X.X.X-XXX-generic\nsudo dpkg --purge linux-image-Y.Y.Y-YYY-generic linux-image-extra-Y.Y.Y-YYY-generic linux-signed-image-Y.Y.Y-YYY-generic\n\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\ndpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-\"[0-9]*\" | awk '/^ii/{ print $2}' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut -f1,2 -d\"-\"` | grep -e '[0-9]' | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\n\nA: In case you are working with unattended updates this issue will re-occur and you might want to fix it for good.\nAs described in the RemoveOldKernels page on the Ubuntu Community wiki, you can configure your unattended upgrades to automatically remove old kernels by adding the following line to your unattended update config file:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";\n\nImportant: make sure you really want this, because as stated in the wiki:\n\nIt also removes other unneeded packages, as well, which is or is not what you want.\n\n", "Q: Openbox: desktop, autostart, new aplications installation issue My computer is very old so in my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am running 'openbox', which is minimalist (therefore it makes my computer to run smoother).\nBut I have some doubts/issues about openbox\n1) How do I put desktop icons on openbox?\n2) How do I set a wallpaper on openbox?\n3) How do I set to autostart 'xfce4-panel' (which gives me a more friendly visual to my openbox)?

Is that part of the Ubuntu system, that installed with some update and is it safe to be there?\nThank you!\n\nA: Those are automatically added when you install OpenSSH server (sshd).  It allows you to use keys instead of passwords with ssh, making it more secure.  I believe the keyring is what allows you to have the server remember the key so that you don't have to constantly keep reentering it every time you do a command such as scp, which is very convenient if you are copying a number of files (or other ssh commands).\n", "Q: All sites fail with 401 unauthorized I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and until yesterday everything was fine.\nToday I cannot access any site (no matter which browser I use). \nIf I start Firefox, it wants to go to: start.ubuntu.com and I get a popup with in the title \"Authentication required\" and then it says: \"A username and password are being requested by http://start.ubuntu.com.

Do you have a NAS (network attached storage, e.g. external hard drive plugged into your router)?  Net Disk is a brand of those and it is somehow possible that your port 80 (http) is being routed to it for some reason.  Try going to an https site (e.g. https://news.google.com/) and see if you have the same issue.\n\nA: With a big thank you to rpierce I can say that his comment did the trick.\nI unplugged the external hard drives and it all worked again.\nI may have also found out what was causing the problem. The external hard drives are plugged into a wireless router which is connected to the main router/modem.\nEver since I unplugged the cable between the two routers the problem with the http-traffic was solved. But once I plugged the cable back in, the secondary router does not connect to the main one any more.\nI suspect it is because the UTP-connector is not installed very well. I guess that may have caused some unwanted traffic.\nThanks again for the quick and very useful reply!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Brightness Problem Yesterday I downloaded Ubuntu and installed it on my laptop (Sony Vaio PCG-71811M), with Windows 8.1 dual boot.

I have created NTFS file partition drive with some space leftin Ubuntu, does using NTFS format drive ok to use or should I convert it to ext4?\nAre there any disadvantages of using NTFS file system in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I can think of two disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I use NTFS in Linux I found that performance is worse than ext4, particularly when opening with the file manager a directory containing several hundred or more files/folders (it takes way more time to load) or when copying large amounts of data like 1 GB or more (that's my personal experience after comparing copying the same set of data using the same media and changing the file system)\n\n*If the file system is not cleanly unmounted (i.e. power shortage), it refuses to mount unless it's checked with an NTFS file system check utility or is forced to mount, which most of the times you need to do manually (that is, using terminal). Most of the times the file system check is automatically done when is ext4.\nGiven that, and if you are going to use Linux only, I think that is better to use ext4,  however if you have a dual boot computer (Linux and Windows) and you're going to open that partition in Windows, go ahead and keep the NTFS partition to share files between the two OS.\nIn that scenario, keep in mind that (and this can count as a disadvantage) you can create names in Linux with characters that are reserved in Windows, so you can't open that files in Windows. i. e. you can create a file named \"file#1.txt\" in Linux, but that file can't be opened in Windows since \"#\" character reserved in Windows.\n\nA: \nUsing NTFS file system in ubuntu 14.04, does it harm hard disk?\n\nNo. Harm it does not. But the question is a bit strange (why would a filesystem harm a hard disk?)\n\nAre there any disadvantages of using ntfs file system in ubuntu?\n\nYou can not install Ubuntu on NTFS. The \"/\" and the \"/home/ partition depend on POSIX (the chmod and chown permissions is part of that) and NTFS does not support that. \nYou can put \"/\" and \"/home/\" on EXT and have the directories in \"/home/\" (ie. Documents, Pictures, Downloads) on a NTFS filesystem and even share that amongst other users on that system. In general you can put all your personal data on NTFS. \nIf you do use NTFS it is advised to always have a Windows on that system (dual boot; you can hide the boot menu so you do not see it unless you boot into grub yourself and pick Windows to boot from). If the gets damaged it is best to use dedicated Windows repair tools.\n", "Q: Sony Vaio S dual boot issue I used usb stick to boot and install Ubuntu in legacy boot option since it did not boot in UFI\nInstall alongside windows option was not available so I install it manually \neverything went fine but when I tried to use gurb boot repair, it told me to boot in UFI mode.\nbut when I boot with UFI I get windows.\nand when I boot with legacy I get Ubuntu.\ncan someone help me pls to fix this boot issue\nI want windows 7 to be the default boot since I use it most of the time.\nI prefer if you give me a flexible solution since I might update to windows 10 in the future and I don't want to lose Ubuntu and reinstall it.\n\nA: You have installed Ubuntu in legacy mode and Windows in UEFI mode, so you now have to \"switch\" between OSes using the UEFI menu...

Anyone who has a basic knowledge of Terminal and was able to set up their raspberry Pi initially will be able to follow it.\n\nTl;Dr\n\n*\n\n*Setup your Rasberry Pi and establish a LAN connection via SSH\n\n*Shutdown your Raspberry Pi with sudo shutdown -P now\n\n*Plug your SD card into a linux distro\n\n*In a text editor add a config file called \"wpa_supplicant.conf\" to the /writable/system-data/etc/ folder on the Writable partition of the SD card\n\n*I did this by creating the conf file on my desktop and then using sudo cp to move it to the correct directory\n\n*The config file should be:network={ssid=\"Typhon Secure\" Use your network SSIDpsk=\"*******\" Use your network Passkey}\n\n*Note: This works for Hidden Networks as well\n\n*Eject your SD, plug it into your Pi, boot your Pi; it should connect to your WiFi\n\n\nMy tutorial begins from the point of having an ssh connection via ethernet, which can be achieved by following the instructions at Ubuntu Core Get Started Raspberry Pi 2/3.\n\nThen type wpa_supplicant and you will see that it does not need to be installed as it is pre-built into Snappy Core. As you'll see in the below images, just running wpa_supplicant will return a lot of options, but notice the last line:\nwpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\nWhat this tells you is first the Driver, then the Interface, then the location that it is looking for the interface file: -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\n\nNow that I knew where the configuration file needed to be, I shutdown the Raspberry Pi with sudo shutdown -P now and once it shutdown; disconnected the power and inserted the SD into a linux box with Fedora. Somehow the file system shows differently so you'll find the location where wpa_supplicant.conf needs to be location is at writable/system-data/etc and the SD card mounted in /run/media/cregger/ for me, so you'll see my file path is /run/media/cregger/writable/system-data/etc/.\n\nI used nano to create a new file called \"wpa_supplicant.conf\" with the following four lines:\nnetwork={\nssid=\"Typhon Secure\" (My network SSID)\npsk=\"*******\" (Obviously the asterisks represent my WiFi passkey)\n} Don't forget to terminate.\nNote that this works for hidden networks with no extra configuration. My network has a hidden SSID and I changed nothing. It has WPA-PSK 2 security; pretty standard fare.\n\nYou'll notice that I saved it to the desktop. I then copied it to the proper location with terminal as it is owned by root.\n\nThen eject your SD card from Linux, plug it back into your Raspberry Pi, plug your power source back into your Raspberry Pi; let it boot and it will seek your wifi.\nYou'll see in my case both Eth and Wlan have taken an IP\n\nI can now ssh via either LAN or WLAN\n\nI know this was long, but I hope it was helpful in helping you to keep from mucking up your FS and installing a bunch of needless applications.\n\nA: From http://www.marinus.nu/2015/02/enabling-wifi-on-snappy-ubuntu-core.html\nYou can install dpkg of the necessary wifi tools \nInstall first from another computer a few tools \nwget http://ports.ubuntu.com/pool/main/w/wpasupplicant/wpasupplicant_0.7.3-6ubuntu2.3_armhf.deb \\\nhttp://ports.ubuntu.com/pool/main/libn/libnl3/libnl-3-200_3.2.24-2_armhf.deb \\ \nhttp://ports.ubuntu.com/pool/main/libn/libnl3/libnl-genl-3-200_3.2.24-2_armhf.deb \\ \nhttp://ports.ubuntu.com/pool/main/p/pcsc-lite/libpcsclite1_1.8.11-3ubuntu1_armhf.deb \\ \n\nI put it on a flash drive and then moved it over\n#Mount External Hard Drive\nmount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /media/external -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137\n\nthen I navigated to /media/external and ran the command \nsudo mount -o remount,rw /\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nthen added this file to /etc/network/interfaces.d/wlan0\nallow-hotplug wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\n  wpa_ssid \"<YOUR_WIFI_NAME>\"\n  wpa_psk \"<YOUR_PASSWORD>\"\n\nthen i rebooted for the effects to take place\nsudo reboot\n\nBonus: for snappy to work remember to set date \nsudo date --set 03 Mar 2015 20:55:00\n\n\nA: As for me, I had the raspberry connected to ethernet so I didn't need to download deb files individually.\nAlso, the official guide (claimed by @AnthonyWong to be here: http://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/start/installation-tips ) didn't work for me because it had some fundamental things missing (allow-hotplug line). Plus it's better to centralize all config in just one file (not two, as this guide encourages, which even tells you to place one in some random /home/ubuntu location...).\nSo, I made this little script that should set everything up for you:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nsudo apt -y install wpasupplicant\n\necho \"allow-hotplug wlan0\" > wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho \"iface wlan0 inet dhcp\" >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho '    wpa_ssid \"YOUR_WIFI_SSID\"' >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho '    wpa_psk \"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\"' >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho \"\" >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\n\nsudo mv wlan0.cfg.tmp /etc/network/interfaces.d/wlan0.cfg\n\nAfter that, disconnect the ethernet cable, reboot the machine (e.g. via sudo reboot), and you're dandy.\nNB: If you prefer static IP instead of relying on DHCP (e.g. for port mapping purposes...):\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nsudo apt -y install wpasupplicant\n\necho \"allow-hotplug wlan0\" > wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho \"iface wlan0 inet static\" >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho '    address 192.168.1.151' >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho '    netmask 255.255.255.0' >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho '    gateway 192.168.1.100' >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\n\n#because my router is rubbish and doesn't provide DNS service\necho '    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8' >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\n\necho '    wpa_ssid \"YOUR_WIFI_SSID\"' >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho '    wpa_psk \"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\"' >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\necho \"\" >> wlan0.cfg.tmp\n\nsudo mv wlan0.cfg.tmp /etc/network/interfaces.d/wlan0.cfg\n\n", "Q: user not recognized from the recovery mode I wanted to add my user account to another group so I booted into recovery mode and chosen the Drop to root shell option but when i type in the shell \nusermod -a -G aGroup myUsername it tells me that the user does not exist.\nI can login by myUsername and the whoami command give my my valid username.\nI do not know where is the problem.\nfor information :\n\n\n*\n\n*the computer(s) is on my school , and all the student of the shcool have an account ,\n\n*we can log in from all the pc(s) in the school network.\n\n\nI want to know too how they can setup this mechanism (about 1000 user can log in from any computer by their username)? Did they create the accounts for each computer?\n\nA: Since this is a school setup, they are probably using LDAP for authentication, in which case you won't be able to modify group membership. You'll have to contact your school's IT department or system administrator. \nYou can't modify them because because any sane LDAP setup requires administrator access to the LDAP service to modify group membership (which is not the same as administrative access to an individual PC). Tools like adduser and usermod work on local users, which are set up in /etc/passwd and /etc/group.\nTo see how to configure an Ubuntu system as an LDAP server or client, see the Ubuntu LTS server guide article on OpenLDAP.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 7 & Ubuntu-Win7 does not show in Grub menu I recently installed Ubuntu onto my PC.  When I went to install it, there was no option to install alongside Windows, so I partitioned space for it myself.  Ubuntu booted up just fine, but when I went back to boot up Windows, it didn't show up in my Grub menu.  I tried \"sudo os-prober\" but got nothing in return from the Terminal.  I also tried updating Grub, but no cigar. \nSo my question is actually dual in purpose, because I want to learn about this kind of stuff: \n1. How do I figure out what is still on all my disks, and\n2.

I attempt to mount them with sudo /dev/sr0 /cdrom\nbut get \"mount: no medium found on /dev/sr0\nXU doesn't seem to have any trouble with CDs or DVDs.\nThe machine configurations are similar; both have Plextor drives, PX-716AL on U, PX-716SA on XU,\nand they worked fine under Windows.\nI'm not very proficient with Linux so I spent many days reading postings on related topics \nand experimenting with things, and finally discovered that there was no entry for iso9660\nin /proc/filesystems on U, but there is on XU.

If this is a router over which you have administrative control, I suggest you check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, I have better luck with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Change the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nIf these changes do not help, please try:\nsudo -i\necho \"options ath9k nohwcrypt=1\"  >  /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf\nexit\n\nReboot and let us hear your results.\n", "Q: open a folder with several files in python How can I open a folder with several files in it? \nI tested this codes but it returns an strange answer. \nimport os\nfor ZebRa in os.listdir(os.getcwd()):\n    num_words = 0\n    for line in ZebRa:\n        words = line.split ()\n        num_words += len (words)\nprint (\"The number of words:\", num_words)\n\nJust returns 9. But it should count the number of words in 7 files, 70 text files. \n\nA: Do you need Python? You can count words using the command line tool wc:\nwc -w *\n\nwc (short for word count) is a handy tool to count words, characters or lines in text files. Open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the files you want to count words and run the command above. The first parameter -w means to count words (as opposed to lines or characters). You can pass file names to count in specific files or use wild cards, such as * to count words in all files in the current folder.\nIn case your files are located in sub folders the easiest would be to use find to get a list of the files:\nfind . -type f -exec wc -w {} +\n\n\nA: As mentioned, your code is not really clear to me. One of the mistakes you make is that you put the linenum_words = 0 inside the loop, which means that on every subfolder, you would start counting from 0.\nIf you want to use python, what would work anyway is to use os.walk, which would count the words in all files in a directory and its subdirectories, no matter how they are arranged:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\ndr = \"/path/to/ZebRa\"; n_words = 0\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(dr):\n    for file in files:\n        with open(root+\"/\"+file) as r:\n            n_words += len(r.read().split())\nprint(n_words)\n\nNote(s)\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep in mind that if you (ever) edited the text files with e.g. gedit, gedit probably made (hidden) backup files, named filename~. These files will also be read, unless you tell the script not to, which pollutes the word count.\n\n*Also keep in mind that the script will break if it runs into unreadable files, again, unless you tell it to pass if it can't read a file.\n\n\nEditing both issues into the script, would make:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\ndr = \"/path/to/ZebRa\"; n_words = 0\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(dr):\n    for f in [f for f in files if not f.startswith(\".\") and not f.endswith(\"~\")]:\n        try: \n            with open(root+\"/\"+f) as r:\n                n_words += len(r.read().split())\n        except UnicodeDecodeError:\n            pass\nprint(n_words)\n\n", "Q: Trying to enable .htacccess in apache2 but my default.conf is relatively empty I've been trying to enable .htaccess for all of my domains in apache2 which is running on ubuntu  14.04, but my default configuration file in /etc/apache2/sites-available appears rather barren in comparison to what guides say it should look like.\nThis is my 000-default.conf file:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port t$\n    # the server uses to identify itself.

If you can live with that you can keep using 14.10 till the end of the world. It is not advised though. We suggest you upgrade to 15.04.\n\n\nA: It is advisable to upgrade from 14.10 to 15.04 which is due to be released after 23rd of April and if you check the Software Updater after that date a link to perform the upgrade will show it is available on-line. If your internet access is reasonably fast following the link will perform the upgrade without loosing any of your data. If the link isn't showing after that date check the Software Updater Settings to ensure the update availability is set to any new version.\nIt should be the same process when the 15.10 version becomes available in October this year.\n", "Q: Latest Emacs Version, Windowed GUI I am having an issue with GNU Emacs 24.3.1. I usually only use emacs for the purpose of compiling .pdf or LaTeX documents. And I am unable to open the program correctly via terminal use.

I know it may sound a bit hilarious,but what should I do with a backed up system in case I want to restore it?\nCan I store the files on an USB or optical disk and then simply reinstall my system..?\n\nA: \nCan I store the files on an USB or optical disk and then simply reinstall my system..?\n\nYes. Things to consider: Duplicity will not overwrite an existing file. Encryption.\nCommand line restore according to the man page:\nduplicity [restore] [options] [--file-to-restore <relpath>] \n[--time time] source_url target_directory\n\nExample (adding encryption; skip that if you did not use it):\nexport PASSPHRASE=SomeLongGeneratedHardToCrackKey\nduplicity restore {--no-encryption} --file-to-restore single.txt \"file:///media/{mountpoint}/\" \"/home/{username}/\"\nunset PASSPHRASE\n\nwhere {no-encryption} if no encryption, single.txt can be wildcards, {mountpoint} points to your external disk, and {username} your user name.\nMind that you will need the passphrase if you used encryption and can not retrieve it if you forget it. Besides that: always test if you can restore it BEFORE deleting you current OS. It might even be worth it extracting the last backup onto the external media and use that to restore your personal files (that way you know you have the files that you want).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 not using ATI Radeon HD 3450, instead using Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.4, 128 bits) I recently installed a ATI Radeon HD3450 on my desktop.

Then format your old partition, then add the unused space to your new partition with your new installation. Here's a rundown\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ISO from their website here (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) \n\n*\"Burn\" the ISO to a USB or disk. You can use \"Startup Disk Creator\", which may come package with Ubuntu, if not you can find it easily in the Software Center. Open that and make a startup disk using the previously downloaded ISO. To select the ISO, you need to click the disk and navigate to it. Also, you'll need to format the USB, so make sure you don’t' have anything important on it.\n\n*After it is burned to the USB, restart you're computer and spam F12 while it starts up. It should bring you to the \"boot menu\" which allows you to choose what to boot off of\n\n*Choose your USB device from the menu with the arrow keys and hit enter.\n\n*A pink screen will show up, hit down and it will bring up a language menu, choose your language, and then choose install Ubuntu. If you get a black screen after that for longer the a min, restart your computer and redo the previous 2 steps and when you make it back to the pink screen after selecting a language, you'll want to hit F6,a small menu will pop up and navigate to where it says \"nomodeset\" and hit enter on it. Then try installing again.\n\n*When you install, set it up like you normally would until you make it to the menu that asks how you want to install it. You will want to choose \"Something else\" at the bottom of the menu.\n\n*Now, here's where things might get a bit confusing since I don't have much information from you. If you have only a single partition, you need to resize it. Double click the partition and reduce the size (preferably to half of what it is) and click ok. \n\n*Now, you want to create a new partition, click on the free space and create and then click on the plus sign button. You want this to be leave the settings alone other than the mount point, which should be the root folder \"/\". Hit ok and continue. If it says you need swap space, you can ignore it if you laptop was running fine without it previously.\n\n*Continue through the installation, its fairly simple at this point, it just asks for you to make a local account, and after that you should be good to go :)\n\n*Now, after you log into your new account, click the icon on the top left corner and type in \"disks\" and click the first link. You will see all your partitions on your hard drive. You want to make sure your old partition is mounted, if not, click on it and mount it.\n\n*Now, use Ubuntu's file manager and copy any personal or important files from the old installation of Ubuntu (probably the entire home folder, that's where most of your important files would be).\n\n*Now, go back to disks, click on your old partition, and format it. Now, you can readd this empty space to your new partition, and your good as new.\nAny questions just ask, I might give you a link to some info that might be more helpful :)\n", "Q: Error :invalid protocol while installing phonegap pramod@pramod-Inspiron-5520:~$ sudo npm install -g phonegap\nnpm ERR!

I am receiving two different figures for my RAM size.\nI have installed 2x2GB RAM and F2 key says I have 4028MB but Ubuntu System Setting \"Detail\" aka \"About this computer\" says I only have 2,9G.  I also checked lshw on the terminal and it says 3008MB is the memory size. This I think is compatible with the system setting.  Which one should I believe?  \nI use Toshiba Satellite p200-143 and there is no doubt the max should be 4G.  OS is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I have installed 64 bit.  \nI also checked BIOS and as far as I know, version 1.70 is the best I can flash with this laptop and I have done that (directly to the latest, skipping the older version, if makes any difference, I don't know).  Please enlighten me if you have any idea what is going on.  Many thanks.:)\n\nA: Second Edit: Here is the Microsoft Technet article that explains the problem.\nAbout the two figures:\n\n\n*\n\n*The F2 key reports what size motherboard BIOS sees for the physically installed memory in the computer;\n\n*The second number that you see (in \"Detail\" and the result of lshw) is the actual size of RAM that the loaded operating system (OS) can use for running programs.\n\n\nBoth are correct and the existence of the big difference is OK.\nHere is the explanation:\nYour computer is using Intel® 945PM Express chipset. This is the official specifications of your computer. Intel 945PM chipset has 32-bit physical memory addressing ability. See page 23 from the PDF document, the text is \"32-bit interface to address up to 4 GB of memory\". So your computer can physically handle only 4GB of addressable RAM space and this don't change regardless using 32-bit or 64-bit kernel. Various systems and devices need to reserve some RAM address space in order to work. For example the PCI-Express bus needs 256MB of RAM address space. The video card needs additional 256/512MB depending on the model and the implementation. There was similar problem with MacBook Pros. If you have 3GB RAM in your system that is not a problem because the PCI-Express and videocard address spaces are allocated just before the end of RAM i.e. above 3GB. But when you have 4GB, the memory controller has to disable the access to the RAM on addresses between the 4GB and where these buffer space starts. \nHere is an illustration of the problem. I don't know the guy but it should help to illustrate what is going on. This is the original post.\n\nEdit:\nYou can check how the address space is allocated by the command cat /proc/iomem. And here is Stackoverflow question how to understand the output.\nThis problem will not occure on systems equiped with Intel 965 chipset. It can handle more RAM.\n\nA: This is Computer Science 101 material. You never can have full 4 GB of RAM available, because the system will cache some memory for peripherals , such as keyboard, monitor, touchpad, etc., and there has to be some cached for kernel. It doesn't matter which OS, it's more of the way computers are built.\nFor instance I have 6 GB (one 2GB stick and 4 GB ), but free -h reports 5.6 GB. It's totally normal behavior\n", "Q: Windows and Ubuntu as dual boot and when partitions should be primary and logical?

But basically, you should use Primary for both your OS installations. And Swap probably should be a logical drive since you can only have 4 primary drives and there's no real reason to waste on of those spaces for swap. \n\n*I'm a bit confused by what you mean here. Are you installing separate partitions for each of those folders? There's really no need to do that, you should just install your entire OS on one partition unless you have multiple hard drives or SSDs that aren't large enough to hold a single OS, which most of the time isn't a problem, a little more info would be helpful :)\n\nA: you should check out this page :\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/Partitions\nIn my case, i've created two partitions :\n4 GB Swap Logical\nRest in ext5 Logical\nI think it is the best solution\nHope it helped you\n", "Q: How do I boot a Linux LiveCD on a Lenovo Yoga?

When I insert the disc into my external DVD drive connected to my Lenovo Yoga(Running Windows 8.1) and reboot, it boots directly to Windows. How do I get it to boot to the LiveCD?\n\nA: Try to press ESC as soon as your laptop boots..better press ESC continuously as soon as you power on the laptop.This will give various BIOS options.Press Function Keys as required.I can't tell which one as they are different from brand to brand.Somewhere you will find an option for boot sequence.Make sure your Linux Disc(Exteenal DVD drive) is above everything.Also turn boot mode from UEFI to Legacy if required.\n\nA: I have solved the problem.

You divert them instead. For convenience, what I do is use a helper package like config-package-dev.  With config-package-dev, you give your configuration files some specific names, and the installation will automatically do the required diversion.\nFor example, if your package is named foo-bar, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your debian/rules will have:\n%:\n    dh $@ --with config-package\n\n\n*Your configuration files end with .foo (for example, lightdm/20-lubuntu.conf.foo is created by your package building process) - the first word of your package name is used for this extension.\n\n*You have config-package-dev in as a Build-Depends in your debian/control. For example:\nBuild-Depends: debhelper (>= 7.0.0~), config-package-dev (>= 5.0)\n\nThis means that config-package-dev needs to be installed before you try to build the package, but not for installing.\n\n*In addition to the debian/install file, create a displace file listing each file which needs to be diverted. For example, it would contain:\n/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/20-lubuntu.conf.foo\n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu destroyed everything I'll try to be short and simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*I had Windows 8.1 (came with the computer)\n\n*I tried to install Ubuntu\n\n*I accidentally clicked continue with \"erase disk and install\" selected.\n\n*Now everything is gone...

That's why there's only one partition left (actually there are more like the swap partition, but you can't see those). These operations however destroyed the original data.

By deleting the Ubuntu partition the BootManager that took care of the dual boot to Ubuntu and Windows was also deleted.\nYou could use an Ubuntu Live CD/DVD to reboot from. One of the installation steps will let you allocate only 64 GiB out of the 124 GiB remaining unallocated. At another step it will setup the BootManager to allow you to dual boot.\nAnother way, is to use a Windows DVD to fix the BOOTMGR.

The machine already has Windows 8.1 on it and has a Gigabyte Z77-D3H motherboard. Thanks. \n\nA: I did my Bootable USB with Ubuntu 14.0.4 last week with LiveLinux from a windows 7 machine. They also have a great page to help you set it up. After Your done you can either boot to install or just run directly from the key.\n\nLittle Tutorial:\nDownload LinuxLive USB Creator if not already done and install it.\nStart LinuxLive USB Creator from your Start Menu -> All Programs -> LinuxLive USB Creator\nCreating a Linux Live USB key is then a five easy steps process:\n1. Choose a USB key or drive in the list.\nAll you have to do in this first step is choosing your USB device (drive or key) on which you want to create a Linux Live USB key.\nRequirements are:\na USB device with a FAT32 or FAT partition *\nusually 810 MB of free space (but depends on what Linux you install) **\n2. Select an ISO file or a CD.\nSelect an ISO file, CD or folder containing the extracted LinuxLive ISO's files. If you don't have any ISO or do not know what to install, use the Download button and select a Linux distribution (Ubuntu is a good choice to begin).\n3. Choose the size of persistent data\nWhat is Persistence?\nUsually, on a live CD or Live USB key, all modifications are discarded when you reboot.\nThe persistence allows you to keep your preferences and data even after reboot.\nThe data are stored in a special file called casper-rw (for Ubuntu) and overlay-USBLABEL-UUID (for Fedora). This is a completely transparent process for the user.\nUsually, 300 MB are enough to install some software but you can use more.\n4. Check the Options you need.\nEnable launching LinuxLive in Windows (= Virtualization):\nThis is the most important option. It allows you to launch a LinuxLive directly in any Windows without any configuration nor software installation on your hard drive. No other Creator offers this exclusive feature.\nLinuxLive USB Creator made it possible with a special homemade version of the famous virtualization software VirtualBox. It will download this portable version on your USB key (no installation) and will set it automatically for you. If you don't know what virtualization is, then read the What is virtualization? article of the FAQ.\nTo launch your LinuxLive in Windows, just run Virtualize_This_Key.exe * located in the VirtualBox folder on your USB key.\n\n\n*\n\n*Be aware that you need local administrator's privileges in order to launch VirtualBox.\n\n\nHide created files on the USB key:\nThis will just hide the files created on the USB key. The files will be invisible only in Windows because of attributes S (system) and H (hidden). To see the files, go in Folder Options -> View -> Advanced settings and check Show hidden files and folders.\nThis option is quite useful because many files will be created on your USB key.\nFormat the USB key in FAT32:\nUse this option if your USB key is using NTFS, if you need more space or if you want to clean your USB key.\nBe careful, it will erase EVERYTHING on your USB key.\n5. Click the lightning button to start.\nPlease close any window / program using the USB key. This includes Explorer windows opened on your USB key.\nAll you have to do is to click on the lightning button to start the creation.\nHow long to create a LinuxLive USB Key?\nHere are the steps followed to create the LinuxLive USB key and estimated times:\nFormatting the USB key (if option checked) (1 min.)\nCleaning previous install (< 1 min.)\nDownloading VirtualBox as a background task * (5 - 10 min. but in the background)\nCopying source files to the USB key (5 - 10 min.)\nRenaming some files (< 1 min.)\nHiding files (if option checked) (< 1 min.)\nCreating the persistence file (1 min. per 100 MB)\nFormating the persistence file (1 - 5 min.)\nInstalling boot sector (< 1 min.)\nUncompressing and installing VirtualBox on the USB key (3 - 7 min.)\nMoreover, each mandatory step (1, 2 and 3) has a traffic light to indicate its state:\n\n\n*\n\n*Red light: the step has not been carried out correctly, you cannot start creating a Live USB key.\n\n*Orange light: there is a non blocking problem during this step, you can still start the creation List item.\n\n*Green light: everything is fine\nhttp://www.linuxliveusb.com/help/guide\n\nA: Try to make the live USB using Rufus (\"Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives, such as USB keys/pendrives, memory sticks, etc\" for Windows), and select GPT partition scheme for UEFI computers. Maybe will help\n", "Q: Composing a message in Ubuntu Touch Messaging App I have ubuntu touch installed on a Nexus 5 phone using multirom.\nI can't imagine how this isn't a stupid question, but how do you compose a message in the messaging app?

When I apt-get install wine it was like a few hundred megabyte download, but when I purge it it was 21kb...\nThen I deleted the .wine folder thinking it was the cause. \nI ran apt-get install wine again and it was 21kb download...\n\nA: It is normal for a software application to require more than just one package, and when you install the main package, it causes a number of dependent packages to be installed as well.\nThis is the case with wine: the main package called wine doesn't even contain any code at all, it simply just has a dependent package called wine1.6 which in turn depends on a bunch of other packages.  \nOf these, wine1.6-amd64 and wine1.6-i386 are both around 15MB in size, which will account for around 30MB (both are required, as Windows needs to run both 64- and 32-bit Windows applications).\nThen there are a bunch of other packages such as multimedia libraries and fonts.  Depending on how many of these you happened to have installed already, it could have been dozens of MB in download.\nIf you remove the package wine alone, you won't be removing wine - you have to remove its dependencies as well.  Luckily you should be able to do that with apt-get autoremove wine so that it removes anything that was automatically installed when you installed wine.\n", "Q: Why should I partition my disk for Ubuntu 14.04? So I am a new user of Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and I was wondering if its really necessary to partition my HDD. Is my boot up gonna be faster if I do partition it or is it just good practices to do it.\n\nA: All hard drives have a partition table and one or more partitions.  When you install Windows it will also install into a partition; in fact it'll probably create the partition for you.\nBy default if you buy a new hard drive, it'll just have one big partition covering the whole drive.\nIf you want to install two different operating systems (eg Windows and Linux) on the same disk they will usually need to be in separate partitions.  This means that you need to re-partition the drive so that the first partition does not take up the whole drive, then add a second partition (or multiple partitions, if the new OS needs it).\nWhenever you install any operating system it always needs to be placed into one or more partitions.  The number and arrangement of partitions you need on your disk just depends on whether there are other operating systems on the same disk, and how many partitions each operating system uses.\n\nA: Following up to the comments to neon_overload's answer, it is necessary that you create a swap partition for Linux, if you intent to use suspend-to-disk, also known as hibernation.\nEven if you don't, it is recommended, because a separate swap partition provides at least equal and often better performance than a swap file inside another file system.\nFor more info see http://www.alexonlinux.com/swap-vs-no-swap.

But there's no sign of any wireless functionality. The network menu shows only the wired connection.\nThe laptop has a push button that toggles red or blue to toggle the wireless. When I'm running Ubuntu, the button stays red no matter what. When I run Windows, it goes blue and wireless works fine.\nWired networking works in Ubuntu on this laptop.\nI'm pretty much ready to conclude that Ubuntu is not capable of running wireless, at least on this hardware. Is this correct?\nI\"m relatively new to Ubuntu and it really surprises me that Ubuntu is so user-unfriendly on such a basic function as wireless connectivity.\n\nA: Ubuntu is quite capable of running this hardware wirelessly. Remarkably, the live USB, DVD and indeed Broadcom themselves offer to install the wrong driver for this device. Getting it corrected running the live USB is a bit tricky.\nI suggest you reboot the device. Ignore the offer to install Additional Drivers; in this case, Wrong Drivers.

Typically I recommend 1 to 1 up to 5 Gig. I have never seen a point of having more than that available as swap on a standard computer. the point of Swap space is not to use it to expand memory since it's incredibly slow, but the point is to keep your system from crashing in the event that you run out of ram.\nI have run into several situations in the last month for example where I've gotten up in the morning to find my system deep into cache because I forgot to close the website of a winner organization that hired some inept JavaScript programmer to develop them an application with a significantly reliable pool of memory leaks.\nYou never know what might happen, or what bug you might uncover that pushes through your ram and into cache. Without the cache in play you'll find yourself crashing. Disk space is cheap now days, it's worth having a swap partition.\n\nA: It is necessary that you create a swap partition for Linux, if you intent to use suspend-to-disk, also known as hibernation.\nEven if you don't, it is recommended, because a separate swap partition provides at least equal and often better performance than a swap file inside another file system.\nFor more info see http://www.alexonlinux.com/swap-vs-no-swap.

This file is recreated automatically whenever the update-grub command is run.\n\nYou could edit  /etc/default/grub and then run update-grub. These are probably some options you want:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\nSets the default menu entry. Entries may be numeric, a complete menuentry quotation, or \"saved\"\n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB_DEFAULT=0 Sets the default menu entry by menu position number. The first \"menuentry\" in grub.cfg is 0, the second is 1, etc.\n\n*GRUB_DEFAULT=saved The information in this section applies to GRUB 1.98 and later. The \"saved\" entry enables the \"grub-reboot\" and \"grub-set-default\" commands to set the default OS for future boots.\n\n\n*\n\n*grub-set-default Run from a terminal, sets the default boot entry until changed.\n\n\n*\n\n*The format is sudo grub-set-default X, with X being the menu entry position (starting with 0 as the first entry) or the exact menu string.\nExample: sudo grub-set-default 3\n Example: sudo grub-set-default \"Ubuntu, Linux 2.6.32-15-generic\"\n\n*To obtain the existing menu entry choice number (starting from 0) or the menu entry \"string\", run:\ngrep menuentry /boot/grub/grub.cfg \n\n\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\nIf set to true this setting will automatically set the last selected OS from the menu as the default OS on the next boot.\n\n\n*\n\n*No commands need be run to set the default OS.\n\n*Any time a menu entry is manually selected from the GRUB 2 menu, it becomes the default OS.\n\n*This option currently does not work if your /boot directory resides on an LVM partition or RAID.\n\n*For this to work you must also set GRUB_DEFAULT=saved. \n\n\n\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=\nWait this many seconds for the user to press a key. During this period no menu is shown unless the user presses a key. If no key is pressed, control is passed to GRUB _TIMEOUT when the GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT expires. See the note regarding bugs to this feature at the end of this section.\nThe developers envisioned using this setting with a GRUB_TIMEOUT value of 0. This would give users a period of time (GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT) to display the menu by pressing a key, after which the system would boot without the menu being displayed (GRUB_TIMEOUT=0). \n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0   No menu is displayed. The system is immediately booted to the default OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the value is set to 0, and if the SHIFT key is depressed during the boot process, the menu will be displayed. This gives the user a method of interrupting an automatic boot which would normally not display the menu. \n\n\n*GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=X  X is a positive integer (e.g. 1, 5, 10, etc)\nThe boot process will pause and display a blank screen or the designated splash image for X seconds. At the end of the time period, the system will boot. No menu will be displayed.\nWhile GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT is active, the menu can be displayed by pressing any key. \n\n*GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=   No value entered after the = sign. \nThe menu will be displayed for the number of seconds designated by GRUB_TIMEOUT. \nGRUB_TIMEOUT=\nSets the time period in seconds (1, 5, etc) for the menu to be displayed before automatically booting unless the user intervenes.\n\n\n*\n\n*This instruction begins at the expiration of GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT.\n\n*Setting this value to -1 will cause the menu to display until the user makes a selection.\n\n\n\nSo, probably adding/changing these lines in /etc/default/grub (changing the 0 in GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to whatever your choice is):\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\nThen run sudo update-grub\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04: Cannot change screen resolution I know there are many questions with the same topic, but no solution seem to apply to my case...\nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04 on a Toshiba Satellite L735 laptop.

This means that if 20 files are found, you will have to close vim 20 times to get back to the shell and you cannot move between the files within vim.\nWith \"+\", a single instance of vim will be opened with all of the found files.

I bet it will perform enough to fulfill your first requirement, though ;>\nfeh is an image viewer with many options (see man page), one of which is the -A or --action option, which allows you to execute a script if you hit the action_0 key (RETURN by default, can be configured).\nExample of your second usecase:\ncd ~/Pictures/\n# create a folder for selection\nmkdir selection01\n# tell feh to link files to that folder when action is triggered\nfeh *-2016.jpg -A \"ln -s ../%F ./selection01/\"\n\nYou can easily write a script to call with the action in order to toggle (remove and link) the files you want to collect and maybe use something like notify-send to give you some feedback via GUI.\n", "Q: How to get rid of installed .exe files? How do I get rid of any .exe files installed through Wine for example?\nIs there some general rule or way where are .exe software stored and I can just click and get rid off them?\n\nA: I am guessing you meant 'Wine' software, used in Linux for executing Windows software on Linux.\nIn that case, just go to the Wine option through menu, use 'Uninstall Wine Software' option, (on a slow computer, it may take a while) a window will appear with title of 'Add/Remove Programs'.\nThis window's Applications tab shows the currently Wine installed Windows software onto your Linux. Select the Windows program you want to un-install, then click the 'Remove' button.\n\nA: If the program is not listed in the Add 'Add/Remove Programs', use the Ubuntu Dash and search for \"Browse C: Drive\". Click on the first result that appears (make sure it's and application). This will open WINE's C: drive in the file manager. Now you can just go into the \"Program Files\" folder and delete to your hearts content!\n", "Q: wget set name of downloaded file I'm using the following command to download web pages into static html files:\nwget --quiet http://mytestdomain.com/sitemap.xml --output-document - | egrep -o \"http?://[^<]+\" | wget -i -\n\nBut it just outputs each file like this:\nindex.html\nindex.html.1\nindex.html.2\nMy question is, is it possible to modify this command so that each saved file uses's the original page's title instead of index.html?\nThanks\n\nA: option \"-O filename\"  will set the output name\n-O is capital o, not zero\n", "Q: find a process' time in the current state I'm Looking for a way to show the time a certain process is in it's current state.\nAt the moment, I'm using the command:\nps -A -o uname,pid,state,etime,cmd | grep -e pbs | egrep -v \"grep\"\n\nWhich give me output like this:  \nroot      1613 S  4-00:16:59 /usr/sbin/pbs_server\nroot     13508 S  1-18:13:37 /usr/sbin/pbs_sched\nroot     15344 R    01:09:51 /usr/sbin/pbs_mom\n\nThis tells me pbs_mom is running for approx one hour. However, I need to know for how long it has this running state. Is there a way to get this using only the command-line? (since I'm intending to use it in a script)\n\nA: Sadly it is not possible to tell how long the process has been in the current state (or at what time the process state changed last) - the kernel doesn't keep this kind of history. \nImagine the vast amount of overhead (processor-time-wise and memory-wise) to keep the timestamps of every context-switch (several hundred to several thousand per second).\n", "Q: Using 12.04 LTS network manager mixing up login and wifi passwords I've been using 12.04LTS on my laptop for a while now, with automatic security patches etc. etc. I use wired ethernet at work, and wifi at home. Until recently both worked seamlessly and without any fuss.\nHowever now I find that Network manager will not re-connect to my home wifi, and when I use \"Edit connections\" to check the settings, I see that it has loaded my LOGIN password into the WiFi password field!\nThis is a major security concern for me, because NM should have NO knowledge of my login password, as well as because I understand NM stores what it thinks is network passwords in cleartext.\nI've often had to completely delete all my previous wifi connections and manually connect up to my home router again, typing in my Wifi password to make the connection.\nIs anyone else suffering with this bug? Any fixes?\nI've done some google searching, and on here, and other places, and no-one seems to have reported anything quite like it.\nHelp!?\n\nA: I think there is a simple answer to this.\nWhen you open the browser have you ever been prompted to insert you user password to unlock the keyring? To me this happens quite often.\nIt's also possible for NM to prompt asking for Wifi password (probably due to failed Wifi authentication ), and I can tell you the prompts are very similar in look. \nSo, maybe, you entered your login password to unlock the keyring while you were changing the wifi password instead. It has happened top me.\nThat explains why you find your login password in NM.\n", "Q: Problem with double screen when turn on the PC when I turn on the pc the GRUB appear in my VGA screen and I want that GRUB appear in my HDMI screen, any solution?\n\nA: When grub is running, no device drivers have been loaded yet, so it's basically running in BIOS mode, so this depends entirely on your BIOS.\nThat being said, I've made it work on a PC with a broken laptop screen by turning off the power management features of the monitor but that was: guess it: using a VGA cable instead of the HDMI cable, so I think you're out of luck unless your primary monitor can be used with something else then VGA and the HDMI screen can be connected with the VGA cable...\n", "Q: apt-get cannot install specific version listed in apt-cache policy I'm trying to install a particular version of redis-server from a third-party repo using apt-get, that's listed in apt-cache policy, but cannot be installed.

The problem is I'm using Unity, the theme is Ubuntu Mono Dark, and I'm using non overlay scrollbars so I'm having a hard time actually seeing the scrollbar. \nThis bug has been plaguing me since at least 2011 and it doesn't look like anybody has looked at this.

Since Google Chrome is my go to browser this solves the problem for the web. I managed to patch things up with Gnome Terminal and Gedit by editing some system files but I don't really count that as solving the problem since these fixes will get wiped out by updates.\nFor my other gnome apps I used the advice given here to install the addon gnome-color-chooser.

DEFT employs LXDE as desktop environment and WINE for executing Windows tools under Linux. It features a comfortable mount manager for device management.\nDEFT is paired with DART (acronym for Digital Advanced Response Toolkit), a Forensics System which can be run on Windows and contains the best tools for Forensics and Incident Response. DART features a GUI with logging and integrity check for the instruments here contained.\nBesides all this, the DEFT staff is devoted to implementing and developing applications which are released to Law Enforcement Officers, such as Autopsy 3 for Linux`\n\n", "Q: Empty /boot/efi directory Currently running 14.10.\nWhen I first installed rEFind I could access the refind.conf in /boot/efi/EFI/refind.

Type sudo blkid | grep fat to see a list of possibilities. With any luck there'll be just one, but you may need to check two or more to figure out the right one. (You can mount a partition temporarily with the mount command, as in mount /dev/sda1 /mnt, then check its contents and unmount it with umount /mnt -- note there's just one n in umount; that's not a typo.)\nThere are numerous variants on the options (utf8,fmask=0133 in this example).

My Question in a Nutshell\nI’m looking for a tool with which I can easily organize/manage the video footage I have recorded. I don’t want to only tag the video clip files themselves, though; I would rather like to add notes to different positions in the videos so that I can more easily find the highlights of my shots later.\nI’m not looking for solutions which change the videos themselves. It’s really just about adding metadata on the frame level.\nWhat I have Found\nAs far as I can see, most existing media management tools only allow to tag on the file level but for videos it would be very helpful to add tags/markers on the timeline (or frame level) of each video.\nThe only tool that I have found which comes close to what I’m looking for is Advene – suggested in this AskUbuntu answer. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get Advene to display any of my videos.\nWith Blender I could somehow do what I need, however, it’d be overkill and cumbersome to use for this task.\nWhat I have in Mind as the Ideal Solution\nThe ideal tool would be a GUI program like Totem or VLC in which I can easily add notes to the video which is currently being played. A note would either be tied to a single timecode or to a span between two timecodes. Adding a note would be done with a keyboard shortcut which automatically pauses the video and then provides a text field in which a comment can be added.\nThe tool would store the notes in a text-based format in a somewhat configurable way. That way, notes could easily be searched later across files with the help of existing tools like grep.\nSince I’m using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, I would somehow want to be able to run the tool there.\nLess ideal but still useful: a tool as described above which can only add highlight markers at certain timecodes (i.e., without text notes).\n\nA: Best Solution: Totem\nIn Totem you can create custom chapters. By choosing “Chapters” from the “View”, you get a sidebar for working with chapters:\n\nBy clicking the “Add New Chapters” button in the sidebar and then using the buttons at the bottom of the sidebar, chapter markers can be added, deleted and saved:\n\nSaving creates a new file with the same name as the video file (but with a different suffix) right next to the video file. The new file is in the XML-based Continuous Media Markup Language (CMML) format, i.e., it can be easily searched with for example grep.\nSince the CMML format is open, such chapter files can also be created by other tools and loaded into Totem. This might become handy, for example, when extracting HiLight tags from GoPro cameras and converting them to CMML for viewing in Totem.\nHonorable Mention: VLC\nVLC has a “Custom Bookmarks” item in the “Playback” menu that can be used for marking positions in videos. These boomarks can be saved into a playlist from where they can also be loaded again.\nUnfortunately the feature seems to have been partly broken for a while now.\n", "Q: 16GB pen drive showing 2MB space after formatting on windows 7 I burned Ubuntu 14.04 image on 16GB pen drive on laptop having ubuntu.\nNow when I inserted this pen drive it showed 2MB free space without recognising any other space.\nI formatted pen drive on windows 7 PC. \nNow after I rebooted my computer and tried to boot from pen drive, i was able to install ubuntu on my dekstop.\nnow my problem is that now also it is showing 2MB free space.\nAfter using the disks utility I get the following displayed :\nhttp://postimg.org/image/6pb8yzdxv/\nHow can I recover my 16 GB free space ??\nPlease Help !!\n\nA: If you want, you can even fix that in windows, run cmd as administrator then type\ndiskpart\nlist disk\nselect disk 1 (make sure its the right one)\nclean (if it complains about permission, just type clean again)\n\nthen just make new volume in disk management, right click on computer -> manage ->disk management\n\nA: You have to remove partition 1 and system Partition 2 ;\nThen you can create a new 16GB partition and format it as you like\nDon't you see that there is a 16GB free space unformatted at the end\n\nA: This is easy to fix.

You can check whether it is an SSH session by testing the value of the SSH_TTY variable.

Windows uses an NTFS filesystem, which Ubuntu does not support. (By default, Ubuntu uses ext4.) If you only want Mac OS X and Ubuntu, you'll have to first boot an OS live (your Ubuntu installation media is a good choice) and delete the Windows partition. You can then make your Mac OS X or Ubuntu partition (your choice) bigger to fill up the new free space you have. You can make Ubuntu bigger or Mac OS X bigger, just a preference. You will then have to see if you can boot Ubuntu still. (I'm assuming your dual-boot works by booting to GRUB and choosing what to boot from there.)\nIf you see your OS choices (it's okay if Windows is still there, we'll take care of that), choose \"Advanced options\" or something similar, and boot your latest Ubuntu kernel into recovery mode. You should see an option to Update GRUB. Choose that, and hopefully everything will work well with a reboot.\n\nIf the above worked for you, skip this. Now, let's suppose that booting your Mac didn't work. Maybe you got some \"No bootable media\" error or something, or GRUB brought you to some \"GRUB recovery command-line\", which, if you don't already know, is not the recovery mode I speak of above. We need to re-install GRUB (assuming your dual-boot works by booting into GRUB to choose your OS). Boot from your Ubuntu installation media, and open up GParted. Use this to figure out the path to your partition with Ubuntu. In my example, it will be /dev/sda2. Once you figure that out, you can close GParted as we don't need that anymore, and open a terminal. Now, be careful when running this. I don't mean to alarm you, but if you don't install GRUB properly (i.e. you install it on top of Mac OS X), there could be disastrous effects! No pressure. Enter the command sudo grub-install /dev/sda2, where /dev/sda2 is the path to your Ubuntu partition. Reboot and change your boot order to boot Ubuntu instead of any other OS. Hopefully, all should be well now. If it's not, look up your problem online. I'm not an expert on GRUB, and even if I was, making every possible error and problem a part of this answer would make an answer longer than it already is, so I am not going to help you with GRUB if you have problems after taking the advice I have already given you above.\n", "Q: Locating opening page in Google Chrome Browser for Linux I use Ubuntu 14:04 LTS and when I fire up the Google Chrome Browser I want an opening pages set up with links of the 100 pages I use regularly.\nHow can I find that page on my desktop please?\nAmpers.\n\nA: Hi it's gona be a loong list isn't it!\nSave your list as a HTML document.\nOpen your document in Chromium.\nIn the settings menue:\n\nOn Startup\nOpen a specific page..

I then used PPA Purge to revert all the changes made by that particular PPA\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nsudo ppa-purge [ppa to be purged]\n\nThis reverted all the changes and restored everything back to normal, everything from checkboxes to nautilus working. \nI hope this helps someone else as this is a deeply frustrating problem, with no obvious answer or cause. I have said it before and I'll say it again, Ubuntu handles one of its best assets very poorly, PPAs. Not being able to quickly see your PPAs in a meaningful way (rather than a list of URLs) or see what packages they install, or indeed what PPA packages belong to is a serious flaw and leads to many hours of frustration. But with the Ubuntu Software Center being abandoned, PPAs are the only way to get up to date software. \n", "Q: How to move files from Ubuntu to Windows then back to a Ubuntu VM What I want to do: Have a Ubuntu development VM on Windows 8.1.\nSetup: I have a new SSD that I just installed Windows onto. I have an old SSD (60GB) that has Ubuntu on it.\nProblem: I am a developer and have projects on the old SSD and don't want to screw anything up.\nI think what I should do is take the entire development folder I have (with all of my projects) and a dump of my databases and move them to Windows. At that point I can wipe the drive and start fresh, using the drive for VMs and storage. \nIs that doable? I know I would still need to put my projects onto the VM, and though I don't know how at least I have the files and can figure it out.\n\nA: As it is possible to also attach a physical disk to a virtual machine this procedure may lead to data loss on write access to this disk. If your data matter I would therefore not recommend you take the risk.\nA much easier way to move your data, that presumably are stored on a file system inaccessible to Windows, is just booting an Ubuntu live system from where you can mount both, your Ubuntu SSD, and your Windows drive. You can then safely copy the data over from the SSD to your hard drive with no risk to these data, as these are still untouched on the SSD.\nAlternatively we can also install Windows utilities to mount your Ubuntu partitions. The you are able to copy and paste your data over to your Windows drive.\nAfter you had set up your Ubuntu VM you can give the data folder on your Windows host access via shared folders, networking, or copy the data into the VM (not recommended because making backups is much harder).\n\nA: While there are ways to create virtual environments right from a hard drive (if you were to boot back to your Ubuntu system) I would be worried about something going wrong and losing the data. Your own suggestion of moving the files and doing a data dump of the database is the route I take when I move from one development environment to another.\nLoad your Ubuntu drive back in the machine and boot to it, export the database(s) and back up your exports and code.\nThen you can load your Windows drive back in, format your 60 gig drive for use with windows to hold the VM(s).\nCreate the VM, and install whatever OS you're going to use.\nTo get the files onto the new VM you have a couple options. First you could share a folder between the VM and the host computer (not something I typically do, but specifically for personal reasons), or, in the event your development environment (VM) will continue to be Ubuntu you could simply install openssh-server on your Ubuntu VM, then using an FTP client on your windows machine (I typically use Filezilla) you can SFTP into your virtual machine and transfer all your files to it.\nFilezilla can be downloaded free from their website, and to install openssh-server on your VM you simply open a terminal CTRL-ALT-T and enter\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n", "Q: No keyboard backlighting I have bought an MS-industral Fusion keyboard.The keyboard supports backlighting and I have tested it on my friends Windows 7 and it worked.I am using Ubuntu 14.10 and backlighting does not work.All the multimedia keys do work.\nBacklighting control is actually on the same key as scroll lock and that also does not seem to work.\nThe only reason I bought this keyboard is because of backlighting.It is helpful for late night programming,gaming and text writing sessions.\nEdit:\nI tested it on Openmandriva and Kali Linux right now and it does not work.\nI also tested it on the alpha/beta Ubuntu desktop next with unity8(15.04) and it worked.When I pressed the button it also activated scroll lock.So maybe if we fix scroll lock.\nEdit2:It also works during boot time all the way until the login screen appears.\nEdiit3:It also works during shutdown.However I noticed if I use it during boot or shutdown it can hang the whole system.\n\nA: Run this command in termial (ctrl+alt+t):\nxmodmap -e 'add mod3 = Scroll_Lock'\n\nHowever, you have to do that each time you open a session.\nTherefore, I suggest you define this command as a startup application, so that it's run automatically upon login\n:)\n\nA: Open Terminal then type: \nxset led\n\nenter, and see the magical happen!\n\nA: For my Lenovo Thinkpad using Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04 , just use Fn+Space to toggle keyboard backlight.\n\nA: I found my answer here in this link:\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/262205\n\nA: xset led named \"Scroll Lock\" to turn on\nxset -led named \"Scroll Lock\" to turn off\n", "Q: Resolution of external monitors stuck at 1440x900 on Thinkpad T430 with Intel HD graphics I'm working on my Thinkpad T430, with Intel HD4000 graphics chipset, in a 3-display setup (the laptop display and two external monitors). I accidentally pressed the Super + P combination, which cycles through display output modes. Even after cycling back to the original output mode, this has the unfortunate effect of limiting my external displays to a resolution lower than their native resolution. Any attempts to rectify this in System Settings > Displays are met with error messages like the following:\nCould not set the configuration for CRTC 64\n\nGDBus.Error:org.gtk.GDBus.UnmappedGError.Quark._gnome_2drr_2derror_2dquark.Code2: could not set the configuration for CRTC 64\n\nEven xrandr, when attempting to set resolution for one of the displays with xrandr --output HDMI2 --mode 1680x1050 merely returns xrandr: Configure crtc 1 failed\nOther answers around the net cite similar errors when having issues with the kernel version limiting their ability to use 3-display setups with Intel graphics, but those issues were fixed several releases back, and my setup was working fine until I pressed Super + P just now, which caused it to go a little haywire. How can I successfully restore the original settings?\n\nA: Well, I solved this issue in the following manner:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to System Settings > Displays again and select one of the external displays. \n\n*Disable that display and hit Apply. At this point you should only have 1 active external display. \n\n*Select the active display in the settings GUI and change its resolution to the preferred setting. It should apply successfully.\n\n*Re-enable the other display, and you may find (as I did) that it has automatically assumed the same resolution setting as your first external display did.\nI was never able to get a clear answer as to what was causing this issue from a technical standpoint, but I was able to find a solution which I figured ought to be documented.\n", "Q: vmhgfs module not compilable for VMware Tools 9.9.0 (Fusion7.1) after Ubuntu Linux kernel update to 3.13.0-46-generic? vmhgfs module not compilable for VMware Tools 9.9.0 (Fusion7.1) and VMware Tools 9.9.2 (Fusion7.1.1 Build 2496486) after Ubuntu Linux kernel update to 3.13.0-46-generic (Febr. 2015) (Shared Folder Feature of VMware Tools not working in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Guest) on MacOSX Yosemite (Host))?  \nHello Community and the VMware Developer Team, \nOn February, 13th 2015 we lost the Shared Folder Feature between Ubuntu and MacOSX. Probably, the update of the Linux kernel to 3.13.0-46-generic caused this problem (although the existing, compiled vmhgfs module of the VMware Tools in Ubuntu wouldn't be damaged by the Linux kernel update!). We use VMware Fusion 7.0.0 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and MacOSX for one year without problems with older Linux kernels.\nWe updated to VMware Fusion 7.1.0 and Fusion7.1.1 Build 2496486 with VMware Tools 9.9.2 in the hope to fix the Shared Folder Feature problem that occured first in vers. 7.0.0.\nWe can suppose that there is an incompatibility between the compiled vmhgfs module and the new Linux kernel 3.13.0-46-generic.\nWe tried to reinstall VMware tools 9.9.0 and vers. 9.9.2 but the vmhgfs module couldn't be compiled and the Shared Folder Feature is not working. All other VMware tool features are working fine.\nIn Ubuntu 14.04 LTS the terminal command lsmod | grep \"vm.\" lists no vmhgfs module\nDuring vmhgfs module compilation there were several \"errors\" near \"/vmhgfs-only/\" and \"make[]:\" \nHere is one of our terminal journals for you:  \ninclude/linux/compiler-gcc4.h:14:34: error: ‘struct dentry’ has no member named ‘d_alias’\n#define __compiler_offsetof(a,b) __builtin_offsetof(a,b)\n                                  ^\ninclude/linux/stddef.h:17:31: note: in expansion of macro ‘__compiler_offsetof’\n#define offsetof(TYPE,MEMBER) __compiler_offsetof(TYPE,MEMBER)\n                               ^\ninclude/linux/kernel.h:794:29: note: in expansion of macro ‘offsetof’\n  (type *)( (char *)__mptr - offsetof(type,member) );})\n                             ^\ninclude/linux/list.h:687:40: note: in expansion of macro ‘container_of’\n#define hlist_entry(ptr, type, member) container_of(ptr,type,member)\n                                        ^\ninclude/linux/list.h:698:15: note: in expansion of macro ‘hlist_entry’\n     ____ptr ? hlist_entry(____ptr, type, member) : NULL; \\\n               ^\ninclude/linux/list.h:710:13: note: in expansion of macro ‘hlist_entry_safe’\n       pos = hlist_entry_safe((pos)->member.next, typeof(*(pos)), member))\n             ^\n/tmp/modconfig-h4Zwi0/vmhgfs-only/inode.c:1920:7: note: in expansion of macro ‘hlist_for_each_entry’\n       hlist_for_each_entry(dentry,\n       ^\nmake[2]: *** [/tmp/modconfig-h4Zwi0/vmhgfs-only/inode.o] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [_module_/tmp/modconfig-h4Zwi0/vmhgfs-only] Error 2\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-46-generic'\nmake: *** [vmhgfs.ko] Error 2\nmake: Leaving directory `/tmp/modconfig-h4Zwi0/vmhgfs-only'\n\n \nAnd /mnt/hgfs is empty but folder sharing is enabled for Mac's \"Documents\" directory for example.

In vmhgfs.tar, inode.c d_alias must be changed to d_u.d_alias , put back to the tar and then recompile tools.\nA script that does that (tested on 32-bit ubuntu 14.04, vmware workstation 11.1 on a windows host) is here:\n#!/bin/sh -x\ncd /usr/lib/vmware-tools/modules/source\ntar xf vmhgfs.tar\ngrep -q d_u.d_alias vmhgfs-only/inode.c && echo \"already patched\" && exit 0\nsed -i -e s/d_alias/d_u.d_alias/ vmhgfs-only/inode.c\ncp -p vmhgfs.tar vmhgfs.tar.orig\ntar cf vmhgfs.tar vmhgfs-only\nvmware-config-tools.pl -d -m\n\nNOTE: this makes the tools incompatible with older kernel versions, i.e. 3.13.0-45.\n\nA: I had the same experience after updating to kernel 3.13.0-46. According to vmware-tools-patches, there isn't a patch available.\n\nThe patches do not yet apply successfully with the following Linux kernels:\n3.13.x\n\nI fixed vmhgfs by:\n\n*\n\n*Reverting to kernel version 3.13.0-45, either by booting\ninto an older version or rolling back your kernel upgrade\nthen\n\n*reinstall vmware-tools.\n\n\nA: Similarly to @Will Wolcott's answer, the recent changes in vmware-tools-patches works around the issue for me on 14.04 with kernel 3.13.\n", "Q: 14.04 install problems I have installed 14.04 LTS.

Since this reported correctly, the problem was most likely at the registrar with either the nameservers not being registered or the domain not using the correct nameservers.\n", "Q: PPA package: Specify different dependencies for different Ubuntu versions Let's say I have a PPA package that depends on the libtool executable to build. In Vivid, this executable is provided by the libtool-bin package. For earlier Ubuntu versions, it is provided by the libtool package.\nUsing a substitution variable like ${dist:BuildDepends} is apparently only possible for Depends, but not for Build-Depends. So how do I specify the Build-Depends in the control file of my package to work with both Vivid (Build-Depends: libtool-bin) and earlier versions (Build-Depends: libtool)?\n\nA: In the case libtool/libtool-bin, I think an OR relation might work:\nBuild-Depends: libtool-bin (>= 2.4.2-1.10) | libtool (<< 2.4.2-1.10)\n\nThe version numbers are that of utopic, when the split was imported from Debian. Note that in 2.4.2-1.10, libtool still depends on libtool-bin. The dependency was reversed in 2.4.2-1.11, which is why this change is now needed.\nDepending on what you do, it might be simpler and safer to add a combined libtool to a separate PPA and depend on it. Since this is a B-D, it needn't be installed by your end-users, so depending on a separate PPA should be safe.\n", "Q: spoofed mac address changes when trying to connect to network So I need to spoof my mac address to access a network. I can spoof it fine with the ifconfig commands, but when I try to connect to the network it gets reset back to the default mac address. Changing the mac address in the persistent.rules file does not fix it either, it still gets reset to the default. How do I do this so it does not change back once I try to connect? As well if I try to put in the new mac address in the cloned mac address field under edit connections, it still uses the default mac. I am using Ubuntu 14.04.1\n\nA: The answer to the solution is:\nsudo service network-manager stop\n\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\n\nsudo macchanger -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0\n\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\nsudo service network-manager start\n\nThe macchanger line can be replaced with whatever macchanger command you need. or with sudo ifconfig wlan0 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n\nA: I came across with this problem a few days ago after updating \"Kali”.\nI use Kali Linux 2016.2 (64 bit), by the way. Before updating/upgrading the system through its repositories, mac changer was working like a charm.\nHowever, soon after the update, I tried to spoof my MAC address in order to bypass some MAC filtering I've set up in my own network, and every time I attempted to do it (and there were several tries), my MAC address was automatically reverted to, or its permanent burnt-in address, or a random one.\nAt first, I was not sure about what could be possibly causing it, but after doing some tests, using different devices, tools and setups, I found out that the issue was being originated by Network Manager, which I realized later being not an issue exactly, but just a different default configuration of the service than the one we were used to.\nThe latest versions of Network Manager, 1.4.2, in this particular case, implement several configuration options for MAC spoofing/cloning, and when put in use, these options tend to override any configurations set by tools like mac changer and macchito, making them practically useless.\nIt turns out that, in its newer versions (above 1.2, but more notably the versions above 1.4, which dispenses wpa_supplicant support for this purpose), NetworkManager default configurations are set to randomize your MAC address or revert it to the permanent one at the moment your interface scans the networks around you or attempt to connect into one of them. This new feature is very interesting for purposes of anonymity; for MAC spoofing, however, it can complicate the authentication process.\nDisabling this feature is very simple, you'll just need to change some NetworkManager's configurations.\nYou can do this either by editing /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file or adding an additional .conf file to /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d directory (the .conf file can have any name).\nThough I highly recommend the second option, given that when updated, Network Manager usually replaces its main .conf file, and if you choose the first option, your saved options may be overwritten when the service gets these updates from time to time.\nWhatever option you choose, in the text editor, add the following lines:\nCode:\n[device]\nwifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no\n\n[connection]\nethernet.cloned-mac-address=preserve\nwifi.cloned-mac-address=preserve\n\nThen save the file, and inside the terminal, restart NetworkManager by typing in:\nCode:\nservice network-manager restart\n\nOR\n\nsystemctl restart NetworkManger\n\nAnd it's done, the problem now should have been resolved.\n", "Q: Unable to access .jar file with .desktop I have a Minecraft.desktop on  /home/myuser/Escritorio\n(Where myuser i put my username and Escritorio means Desktop in spanish)\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Minecraft Launcher\nComment=Minecraft Launcher\nExec=java -jar ~/Descargas/Minecraft.jar\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Game;\n\nAnd a Minecraft.jar in /home/myuser/Descargas (Descargas = Downloads)\nPermissions of Minecraft.desktop: -rwxrwxr-x\nPermissions of Minecraft.jar: -rwxrwxr-x\nWhen i execute the .desktop file nothing happens.\nBut when i execute the .desktop via terminal with the next command:\ngrep '^Exec' Minecraft.desktop | tail -1 | sed 's/^Exec=//' | sed 's/%.//' &\n\nIt says:\nError: Unable to access jarfile ~/Descargas/Minecraft.jar\n\n\nA: You cannot use ~ in a .desktop file, it will not expand.

This is also the first time I've ever posted on a forum to get help, as usually I have found all I've needed in previous questions and answers.\nI'm dual booting Win8.1 and Ubuntu on a dell laptop. I have a separate /boot part that is 100mb. I tried to upgrade the kernel via the 'software updater' UI (don't know if that's relevant... I'm just trying to specify that I didn't use terminal), and it said that there was no space left on /boot. After researching a bit, I deleted the old kernels as well as sudo apt-get clean and emptying the trash and stuff. I rebuilt GRUB and rebooted. I tried to update again, and it says I still need to clear out some 30 or so MB off of /boot for the update.\nI get the feeling from other posts that this is uncommonly large (people were saying they only had 13 MB used with multiple kernels?!)... and I don't know what else to remove from the /boot partition without screwing something up.\nWhat am I missing here?\n\nA: *\n\n*Have a look here for a good strategy on how to make system backups.

I have tried using the official eduroam bash script as well as creating a custom network manager configuration and an attempt at using wpa_supplicant. Im out of ideas and seemingly so is google.

I have a MacBook Air that previously ran Fedora with a dual-boot Windows side for a few engineering tools. I recently switched back to Ubuntu, installing Ubuntu over Fedora using the same EFI boot partition and primary / partition. Somehow in this process, Windows started failing to boot (error code 0xc0000001 or just getting stuck on the Windows logo).\nAfter a lot of troubleshooting, I discovered that my disk had a hybrid MBR partition table (it's a GPT disk) that was confusing both the Windows installer and, apparently, something in the Windows boot process. Unfortunately, I don't know if this hybrid MBR existed before I installed Ubuntu or not.\nI used gdisk to delete the hybrid MBR and replace it with a protective MBR. Now everything boots correctly again.\nMy question is: what did the Ubuntu installer do that caused Windows to be unable to boot? Does it transparently add a hybrid MBR to improve compatibility?\n(By the way, this is just out of curiosity. Everything is working great again thanks to gdisk.)\nThanks!\n\nA: Although a year later, I'd like to share my findings about Ubuntu and disk partitioning. I have been playing with Linux Mint 18 (that just came out). It is based on Ubuntu 16.04. I installed it by letting it use all disk space automatically. Please, note that I am doing it on an iMac 2009 which has some soft of EFI bios. After the installation I ran gdisk -l /dev/sda and it said:\n\nMBR: hybrid BSD: not present APM: not present GPT:\n  present\n\nOn the other hand, as an experiment, I tried manually partitioning the disk by creating protective MBR and then installing. The installation went just fine and it boots with no problems. So, it seems that Hybrid MBR is not mandatory.\nI read this post about the dangers of Hybrid MBR: http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/hybrid.html I have no idea why the installer creates MBR: hybrid when it should be avoided.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - Installed Ubuntu SDK and getting errors on start up I figured I wanted to check out some Ubuntu app development, and followed the \"guide\" on https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/start/ubuntu-sdk/installing-the-sdk/, but it's not quite as simple as the guide would have you know. \nFirst I'm getting a lot permission errors from the /home/.config/Qt* directory.

OpenSSL is a library. It can take various options which are fed to it via the application that is using it - so configuration depends on the application. Assuming you are using Apache with mod_ssl then you probably want to look at the SSLProtocol directive. This is probably the easiest way to do it.\nIt is also possible to configure OpenSSL without SSLv3 at compile time. Obviously that means you have to compile it and install it yourself rather than using the out-of-the-box ubuntu version. To do that download the latest version from the OpenSSL website. Unzip and untar the source file and move into the created openssl directory. Enter the following:\n./config shared no-ssl2 no-ssl3 no-ssl3-method\nmake\nmake test\nmake install\n\nBy default that will install into /usr/local/ssl. You will need to configure your application's LD_LIBRARY_PATH to pick up the libraries from this location rather than the default system version.\n", "Q: sudo apt-get update not working Err http://ppa.launchpad.net utopic/main amd64 Packages                        \n  404  Not Found\nGet:63 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com utopic/universe Sources [6,736 kB]         \nErr http://ppa.launchpad.net utopic/main i386 Packages                         \n  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/cdemu/ppa/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/cdemu/ppa/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

Also, I didn't know if I had to create a second swap partition but I did it anaway.\nI would use different /home/ for each operating system. You never know if you run into a problem where 2 files are named the same but do something different between 2 different operating systems. \nIt is perfectly possible to use 1 swap. \n\n*What would be the best way to create partitions for these two distros?\nI'll answer that with 3. Though I object to \"best\"... There is no \"best\" way. There are several methods but any of these methods is fine. It also depens on what you use your machine for. \n\n*Can i just share the HOME partition, if so, HOW? \nYes but I would not do that with /home/ itself. Why not put the directories om a different partition and mount that partition in to all of your operating systems?  Like so...\nUbuntu: /root\nUbuntu: swap\nUbuntu: /home/user/ \nxUbuntu: /root\nxUbuntu: swap\nxUbuntu: /home/user/\n/discworld/Pictures\n/discworld/Downloads\n/discworld/...\n\nand then symlink /discworld/ or the directories in /discworld/ into /home/user/ \n\n\n*\n\n*You can also skip a separate /home/ and have that as part of /. Saves you about 10Gb per /home/. \n\n*You can also skip adding more than 1 swap if you want.\n\n\nThe general idea is that you do not use /home/user/ and store all your date elsewhere (and that elsewhere can be used on any system). It then does not matter if xUbuntu uses a different set of directories: you just add them all to that partition.\nI have had experience with sharing Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu with 1 /home/ and we quickly decided that a /home/ per operating system and a big datapartition works a lot better. If you consider backup: you backup that partition and have all the important data. All the other can be recreated with a re-install. If you use it as a server all you need to do is point the data dir for MySQL to that partition and for apache set up the virtual sites to that partition. And maybe create a script that copies all the config files to the partition (so those are backupped too). \n", "Q: Setup USB Printing Ubuntu 14.04 on Crouton Toshiba Chromebook 2 I have an installation of Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity installed by Crouton on a Toshiba Chromebook 2.

I'm currently using mhddfs to mount three hard drives into a singluar pool directory. However, due to the allow_other option set, all users have full rw permissions in the pool directory (ignoring any set permissions on the files/folders). I know this is expected behaviour as the pool gets mounted as root and any user that changes into the pool's directory gets their permissions elevated to root.\nMount point in /etc/fstab:\nmhddfs#/mnt/disk1,/mnt/disk2,/mnt/disk3 /storage/pool fuse defaults,allow_other,nonempty 0 0\n\nIt seems that allow_other doesn't care which user actually mounted the pool (same thing happens when I manually mount as myself). Naturally, taking that option out correctly limits the pool to my view only (ignoring any groups I'm in) but I want it viewable at the very least to other users in the same group set by the pool's permissions:\n$ cd /storage && ls -l\ndrwxr-x--- 2 josh share 4096 Feb 16 17:57 pool\n\nAny users in the share group should have read/execute perms. I'm currently exposing this pool via NFS, with all_squash set and anongid=1004 (id of share).\nIs there a way to use mhddfs so that each user's permissions are properly respected when looking in the mounted pool, while still visible to all users? Somewhat similar to the way NFS's all_squash works. Having scoured manuals and other forums, I've turned up bupkiss.\n\nA: I have noticed the same problem a few hours ago.\nFound some help in a FUSE manual.\nThe option \"default_permissions\" seems to do the trick.

Then I need to start Nautilus or Nemo from the commandline using sudo rights. I would like to get a popup whenever it is needed. \nSo I use Nemo (or Nautilus) just like normal and do whatever I need to do. I close it and open it another time, and at one point or another I need to copy a folder to /opt. Then it refuses because /opt is owned by root. A window pops up and asks for my sudo password or for a user that has sudo rights if the specific user has no sudo rights. The folder is copied to /opt and that's it. \nIs is possible to let it work like this, with an extension or something? Do other filemanagers have this option?\n\nA: Nemo already has the functionality to open a folder in a new Window with root permissions. You just have to right-click on a folder icon and select \"open as root\" in its context menu.\n\nImage source: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4PwLsyex1Bo/UEqi2kD9h7I/AAAAAAAAANU/iHXfQRKdMfw/s1600/nemo-file-manager-open-as-root.png\nWhen you click on that option, you will get the gksu-popup asking for your admin account's password.

I choose to manually partition the disk. Then I can create a new empty partition table. This will be a legacy partition table. However, I want a GPT one, but I didn't find a way to select it.\nI've tried to switch to a text console via Alt + F2. However, the command gdisk is not available (neither is fdisk).\nI know that I could boot some live linux first to create the partition table (which seems unnecessarily cumbersome). So my question is explicitly about the standard Ubuntu Server text-mode installer. Is there a way to create a GUID partition table (GPT) during the install?\n\nA: Test this:\nYou switch to a text console via Alt + F2.\nTry to create a partition start GNU parted as follows:\nsudo -i\nparted /dev/sda\n\nOutput:\nGNU Parted 2.3\nUsing /dev/sda\nWelcome to GNU Parted!

This worked flawlessly for me on a SuperMicro X11 mainboard with the official 14.04.4 server installer.  I did have to change the BIOS boot mode from \"DUAL\" (which also allows \"LEGACY\" boots) to \"UEFI\".\nThis yielded a /dev/sda root disk that was GPT partitioned (with a bootable fat32 partition type EF00) without any manual intervention.  I was also able to adjust the \"guided\" partitioning - just because I wanted different sizes and layout, there was no need to do anything special relating to GPT.\nIt would be interesting to know if there are any downsides to booting in UEFI mode.  Can't help but think the technology's been around long enough for issues to have been ironed out...\n\n\nA: Fdisk does not work for GPT, currently.\nBut parted does. Or you can just easily install gdisk.\nAt the current time the installer does not let you select. At some point over 1.5TB (if drive is unpartitioned) or is UEFI it defaults to GPT, otherwise it defaults to MBR and is not otherwise selectable.\nConvert to msdos or gpt, if you have data may be destructive, so have good backups:\nsudo parted /dev/sda\nmklabel msdos/gpt\nquit\n\nYou can easily install gdisk:\nsudo apt-get install gdisk\n\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/\nGPT Advantages (older but still valid)  see post#2 by srs5694:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1457901\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GUID_Partition_Table#Advantages_of_GPT\n\nA: To find the gdisk package:\nfind /cdrom | grep gdisk\nTo install it:\nudpkg -i /cdrom/<blah>\nYou will need to repeat this a couple of times to install libstdc++, libgcc_s and perhaps one or two other shared libraries that are missing from the Ubuntu Server 15.10 installer image, before the installed gdisk package will run.\nYou'll get a couple of errors while installing shared libraries because udpkg is not apt-get and does not resolve dependencies.  Ignore the errors, gdisk will still work.\n\nA: The simplest way for me was to boot into the the existing installation :\napt-get install gdisk\ngdisk /dev/vda\n& write (option o in gdisk) a GPT partition table (which allocated 1 MiB of space at the beginning & end of the disk & preserved a protected copy of the MBR).\nI then rebooted from the CD & chose Rescue Mode& mounted the root partition from the existing installation & ran :\n/sbin/gdisk /dev/vda \n& created the gpt partitions setting the correct partition types :\n\nYou will need to reboot the machine again so the kernel reads the new partition table & begin the installation. \nDuring installation I set :\nPartition 1:\n1 MiB EF02   as filesystem type reserved-bios\nPartition 2:\n250 MiB EF00 as ext4 with noatime,nodiratime mounted @ /boot & marked bootable \n", "Q: Is Ubuntu destroying my internal HDD? I have an Inspiron 3521 that came pre-installed with Windows 8.1. I decided to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, and it was working good.

:-)\n\nThe long answer:\nHDDs die a slow, painful death like cancer, whereas SSDs just suddenly stop working like a heart attack : you can diagnose both by using SMART technology.\nWhy you heard the noises under Ubuntu and not under Windows is because Windows was installed first, so it resides on the inner side of your hard drive in the denser packed region, whereas Ubuntu was installed on the outer regions where the noises are more pronounced due to seeking.\nAnd I can infer all this just from your description of the symptoms without having looked at your hard disk's partition table nor knowing how you installed your system...\n\nA: What kind of sound does it make? If it's clicking you hear, then your OS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DESTROYING YOUR HDD. The problem is ages old and involves Advanced Power Management feature parking/unparking the disk too aggressively. Try using hdparm to check the APM value (-B param). If it's less then 254, set it to 254 and check if it helps with the noise. If it does, make sure the value stays 254 at all times. One good way to ensure this under Linux is to use tlp. For the record, I've seen this problem occur in Windows as well with certain laptop models, but it's way more common in Linux.\n\nA: You have (at least) one bad block (LBA 5642528) that's causing repeated errors. You can try to:\n\n\n*\n\n*backup your entire hard disk\n\n*reformat/repartition your disk using the LONG method to try and\nmake it map out the bad block(s). This could take many hours to complete.\n\n*restore your hard disk\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*replace the hard disk\n\n\nUpdate #1:\nTo test your HDD for bad blocks...\nNote: do NOT abort a bad block scan!\n\nNote: do NOT bad block a SSD\n\nNote: backup your important files FIRST!\n\nsudo e2fsck -fcky /dev/sdXX # read-only test\nor\nsudo e2fsck -fccky /dev/sdXX # non-destructive read/write test (recommended)\nThe -k is important, because it saves the previous bad block table, and adds any new bad blocks to that table. Without -k, you loose all of the prior bad block information.\nThe -fccky parameter...\n   -f     Force checking even if the file system seems clean.\n\n   -c     This option causes e2fsck to use badblocks(8) program  to  do  a\n          read-only  scan  of  the device in order to find any bad blocks.\n          If any bad blocks are found, they are added  to  the  bad  block\n          inode  to  prevent them from being allocated to a file or direc‐\n          tory.  If this option is specified twice,  then  the  bad  block\n          scan will be done using a non-destructive read-write test.\n\n   -k     When combined with the -c option, any existing bad blocks in the\n          bad blocks list are preserved, and any new bad blocks  found  by\n          running  badblocks(8)  will  be added to the existing bad blocks\n          list.\n\n   -y     Assume  an answer of `yes' to all questions; allows e2fsck to be\n          used non-interactively.  This option may not be specified at the\n          same time as the -n or -p options.\n\n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.10 Firefox does not start I just set up Lubuntu 14.10 on my notebook and now Firefox only starts after rebooting for one time.

Will this possibly make it work?\n\nNo. The 2 operating systems have no correlation.\nBesides that: \nYou are taking your Windows experience to another operating system. That is never a good idea. Ubuntu does not work like Windows and the system we are built on (Linux) had a total different approach of what an operating system is.\nWe have generic drivers that either support your system or it does not. If it does not someone (you?) needs to report those issues as a BUG against the package(s) it related to. If someone did that in the past for all your 3 issues they are bound to be fixed in a future release of that package. If nobody has the maintainer of that package probably does not know there is a problem related to your system (he is bound to have another brand computer).\n\nUnstable wireless (have not found a solution)\n\nYou will need to be more specific to get this fixed. Please have a look around Ask Ubuntu for wireless related problems and how to identity what brand NIC you have. \nAlso have a look at your system and router log files. Unstable wireless does not have to be an operating system related problem. It can also be a problem with setttings in your router (maybe you get so many incomming connections the router decides you are being DOS'd). I myself used to be able to kill my wireless playing Guild wars on my Ubuntu system. The system decided I was being hammered and my home router could not handle it. I updated the firmware of my router and only when I started using DDWRT I could fix it by getting access to options I did not have before that.\nWhen you have gathered all information please open a new question dedicated to fixing your wireless.\nIn case you (or anyone) needs help gathering info have a look at this post on ubuntuforums. That script will take care of gathering all information.\n", "Q: Problem with graphic when booting from liveCD i have laptop Lenovo ideapad z50-75 AMD version and i want to install Ubuntu on my external HDD.

Eclipse still crashed now and then, but tolerable (sad to say that).\n\nA: You can view some messages from the previous boot through journalctl with e.g. journalctl -b -1 (the -1 means \"previous boot\", -b -2 would give you the one before that etc.). The journal won't keep logs across boots unless the directory /var/log/journal exists, so sudo mkdir /var/log/journal if it's not there (and then systemctl restart systemd-journald or reboot to make it notice it).\nMagic sysrq doesn't work when the kernel has panicked, which seems to be your situation. (But in case you want to make sure you have it otherwise, do cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq to check whether sysrq is enabled. 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled, other numbers enable individual features.)\nAnother thing that may be useful is to try a live distro in order to test very recent kernels/drivers; live/resque distros may make it a bit safer to experiment with various driver versions. Of course, it helps if you're able to find a \"minimal\" or as minimal as possible situation that reproduces your crash, so you don't have to be in that live session longer than necessary to find out if it's going to crash or not :)\n", "Q: How to assign (set) a MIME type to a file? Is there any command that could set MIME type of a file? for example:  \nmime --set --MIME=\"image/pjpeg\" filename.jpg  \n\n\nA: Question is already answered by @PHPLearner in a comment. However, here is a longer answer.\nThere is no particular command like mime as asked in the question, and no doubt one such command can be created. For adding a new MIME type, all it takes is editing the /etc/mime.types file.\nLet's say you want to add MIME type with extension .btc, then\n1. Check If MIME type already exists\nOpen a command line and enter the line below (replace btc with your extension)\ngrep 'btc' /etc/mime.types\n\nNow, this command will output a line, If that MIME type is already added. It looks like this for particular MIME searches\n$ grep 'cpp' /etc/mime.types\ntext/x-c++src                        c++ cpp cxx cc\n\n$ grep 'py' /etc/mime.types\napplication/x-python-code                       pyc pyo\ntext/vnd.debian.copyright\ntext/x-python                                   py \n\n$ grep 'btc' /etc/mime.types\n\nIf your extension does not output any lines (as for btc in this case), or if the lines outputed do not include your extension, you must create a new MIME type. Otherwise your extension already has a MIME type included in the file /etc/mime.types.\n2.1 Creating the MIME type (IF needed)\nIf there was no output, or the output given did not include your extension, we must add a MIME type. For that type at command line\ngksudo gedit /etc/mime.types\n\nModify the following text so that the word \"extension\" is replaced with your file extension (no period mark), add the line to the end of the mime.types file, and save. Here our extension is bitcoin and we write btc (NOT .btc) that will be seen as an extension for the bitcoin files.\ntext/extension                   extension\n\nAnd copy the modified 'text/extension' part.\nIn our case it will look like\ntext/bitcoin-text                btc\n\nSave the file and exit.\n2.2 Adding MIME type using .xml file and update-mime-database\nIf editing /etc/mime.types file doesn't works for your extension, then you can try this workaround.\nCreate a new .xml file that describes your extension like this & Save it.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<mime-type xmlns=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info\">\n<mime-info type=\"text/bitcoin-text\">\n<glob pattern=\"*.btc\"/>\n</mime-info>\n</mime-type>\n\nNow add this file into /usr/share/mime/packages folder (ref).After you've added or modified whatever you need, run the command\nsudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime\n\n3. Adding an Icon to MIME type\nNow we need to associate an icon with the MIME type. Get an SVG icon and name it \"text-extension.svg\", or whatever your modified MIME type is named; this will be the icon to represent all instances of the MIME type on your system.\nSo, We rename the .svg file so that the it matches bitcoin-text.svg (or \"insertYourMIMEtype.svg\") so that the slashes are replaced with \"-\" and there are no capital letters.\nThen simply run the following commands, with 'bitcoin-text' replaced with your MIME type.\n sudo cp bitcoin-text.svg /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable/mimetypes\n sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/gnome/ -f\n\nRelogin and all files ending in the MIME extension will display with that icon.\n\nA: To actually answer your question: MIME types aren't real.  There isn't some piece of metadata in the file that says \"this is a image/png\".  Instead, MIME types are guessed based on file extension and magic number.  To serve a file as having a specific MIME type, you need to configure your web-server appropriately.  See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29017725/how-do-you-change-the-mime-type-of-a-file-from-the-terminal\n", "Q: How to access an usb device in ubuntu? I have an USB-device used for measuring currents. When I connect this device to windows, I get a new device in the device manager, and a new COM port I can use for accessing the device. When I connect it to my linux (ubuntu 14.04) it is recognized (I can see it via dmesg). How can I access it there? Is there a similar thing as a COM-port where I can send commands to?\nWhen I do ls /dev | grep USB, I get nothing in return. When connecting the device, dmesg tells me:  \n[17480.693973] usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 5 using xhci_hcd\n[17480.763788] usb 3-1: New USB device found, idVendor=104d, idProduct=3005\n[17480.763798] usb 3-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3\n[17480.763805] usb 3-1: Product: CONEX-IOD\n[17480.763810] usb 3-1: Manufacturer: Newport\n[17480.763814] usb 3-1: SerialNumber: A6WXEUPA\n\nTherefore I can not access it via /dev/ttyUSBx. Why?\n\nA: It will create a new device, /dev/ttyUSB0 (or a higher number if that already exists).\nYou can use that like any other file / pipe, depending on what exactly is connected. You will likely need sudo privileges to talk to it, but see this for the fix.\nYou can see in dmesg, where the device was connected, which port was created.\n", "Q: Where can I get this wallpaper?

However, I have not been able to configure Ubuntu 14.04LTS to open the folder placed in the desktop. The answers in this post either don't work (for folders placed in the desktop) or make my desktop disappear (as PcManFM seems to be able to manage the desktop like Nautilus or Nemo).\nI have installed Nemo.

I know that somewhere under /home/myusername I have a file whose name contains the words \"personal\", \"income\" , \"tax\" , \"state\". But I can't remember if the filename is \n\n\n*\n\n*state personal income tax return.doc   or\n\n*personal Income Tax return - state.doc or\n\n*income tax return - State - personal.doc. \n\n\nand I also can't remember if some of the words are capitalized.  Also, I have a zillion other files with each of the words in them. So just doing a simple search on one of the words (like only \"state\",  or only \"tax\") doesn't help me much, because it brings back too many files. \nIdeally, I'd like to be able to just type in [income state return] or [state income return] and have it bring back the files with all three words in the file name, regardless of capitalization or the order of the words. A GUI tool would be preferable, but a Terminal method would be OK too. \nI've tried Catfish and gnome-search-tool/\"Search for Files\" -- neither of them seem to work for multiple search terms unless the terms are typed in order of how they occur in the file name, with no other words in between the search terms.\n\nA: Don't use grep! find has a perfectly fine file name matching syntax. To use your example:\nfind [PATH...] -iname '*personal*' -iname '*income*' -iname '*tax*'\n\nwhere [PATH...] are zero or more paths under which to search.\nIf you didn't disable your mlocate file name database, it may be faster to make use of it for a faster search. You can even tell it to look for multiple conjunctive search terms with the -A/--all option:\nlocate -i -A -b income personal tax\n\n\nA: You can use grep as many times for as much words you want to look for in the filenames. For example to find out the filenames containing the words \"income\", \"tax\", \"personal\" and \"state\" you can do the following:\nls -R /home/myusername/ | grep -i \"income\"  | grep -i \"tax\" | grep -i \"personal\" | grep -i \"state\"\n\nHere the -i switch will ensure case-insensitivity.\nNOTE:\nfind would be better suited for this kind of scenario.

I tried to update and it complained about missing /var/dpkg/ or whatever, I just created that missing directory or file and kept repeating apt-get update. Later I encountered this error message: dpkg: error processing some-package (--configure): and this answer helped me, whenever that error occurred, I just replaced install ok whatever with install ok installed. Now, this, of course, could be dangerous and might mess things up, but if reinstalling the OS is the only choice you are left with, then why not try this as a penultimate resort? And by the way, keep also trying to clean, autoclean and autoremove. So the steps are something like this:\nsudo apt-get updte\nthe error message says: blah/blah/blah file/directory doesn't exist, just go ahead and create those directories/files (empty of course) and repeat the update process. When you encounter, for example, \ndpkg: error processing some-package (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nedit this file: /var/lib/dpkg/status\nand find :\nPackage: some-package\nStatus: install ok whatever \nreplace whatever with installed and repeat sudo apt-get update.

I want to extract those images from the docs:\nunzip foo.docx \"word/media/*\"\n\nThe above command can extract the images from one file, but how can I apply this command to every file in a folder without typing one by one?\n\nA: A simple loop will do the trick. unzip supports specifying a target directory, so you can do\nfor f in *.docx\ndo\n    mkdir -p \"$f\"-images\n    unzip \"$f\" \"word/media/*\" -d \"$f\"-images\ndone\n\n\nA: Use find command:\nfind . -type f -name \"*.docx\" -execdir unzip {} \"word/media/*\" \\;\n\n", "Q: How do I remove old Ubuntu versions I've installed 14.04 \"alongside\" my older versions of Ubuntu, and now I want to delete the older ones, which are taking up too much space. \nWhat is the best way to do it?\n\nA: Are the Operating Systems on the same disk or are they on multiple ones?\nIf there is more than one operating system on the disk, then you can use Gparted to reformat the partitions so you can use them as data partitions.\nYou can use \nlsblk\n\nto list all of the partitions so you know which one to blow away by looking at the mount point. e.g the line\n└─sda5   8:5    0  80.7G  0 part /\n\nwould been that device is the root file system of the current os so you know not to reformat that partition.\nIt is possible to move different parts of your file system to different partitions, but some directories can't be in a partition of their own.\nVisit this website for more information on splitting up ubuntu into multiple partitions.\nAlso, consider reconfiguring grub so that you don't get the deleted operating systems listed in the menu.To do this try using either of these two commands but I haven't tried them myself so I don't know if they will work.\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub\n\n--or--\nsudo update-grub\n\nPlease let me know if you have any more problems.\n", "Q: Replacing Chrome OS on ASUS C300 for Ubuntu I have a Asus C300 and I was wondering if it is possible to uninstall chrome OS and replace it with Ubuntu. If it is possible can I also have some instructions on how to do it. \n\nA: Well I believe the obvious answer to be Yes, if you have a Bootable USB with Ubuntu on it or an CD. But as mentioned below in the comments It may be harder since it was a chrome book.\nFor more Info check this question out: How do I install Ubuntu?\nAlso, possible duplicate: How to install Ubuntu 32-bit on Asus C300 chromebook\n\nA: John Lewis made a good ROM for this Chromebook. I am currently running Ubuntu Gnome on my C300, but I've used KDE Neon, Kali Linux, and Debian. There are a few issues with the install. I had a huge issue with the touchpad not working, but it has been fixed in the 4.2.0-45 Kernel.\nJohn Lewis\nGive it a try. Be careful and definitely use the Chromebook Recovery Utility. \nOh, and I'm told sound works in most ASUS C300s, but is definitely doesn't work in mine. I think I may have done something wrong, but I really don't want to start over and redo everything.\n", "Q: How to rename a movie file by using its internal name attribute? I had to recover a bunch of movie files from my external HDD due to filesystem corruption and used photorec to do so. Now all my files have random names like f00000.avi. We are talking about 1000+ movies here, so renaming them manually would be pretty tedious. As  I understand, most movie files have their titles stored inside the header as well, so is there a way to quickly rename a bunch of files by replacing the random names by the title of the movie?\n\nA: You can try with mediainfo:\nmediainfo f00000.avi\n\nTo rename all .avi files in the current directory, run:\nfor f in *.avi;do title=$(mediainfo $f|grep -i \"movie name\"|cut -d\":\" -f2);mv -v \"$f\" \"$title\";done\n\nInstall mediainfo using the command: sudo apt-get install mediainfo\n", "Q: Alt/Win key behavior in ubuntu gnome 14.04 It seems that \"Alt/Win key behavior\" option is no longer available in gnome settings. how can I change my super key to control?\nmy 2nd question is that how to change the shortcut for rename from F2 to Enter?

It boots well and the Xubuntu loading bar appears.\nNext, the screen splashes twice but my monitor gives an error (screen resolution error) and nothing appear after that!\nAny ideas?\nupdate: I connected my TV instead of my old 15\" monitor & it worked well.\n\nA: If Ubuntu loads well on your TV, but not on the monitor, hook up both together and configure the monitor while looking at the TV using the system settings - screen display.  Once done configuring, shut down the computer, remove the TV and boot the computer again.\nThis will then give you a working system on the monitor.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 8.10 will install on 32 bit sys but 12.04 won't I recently got a refurbished desktop (32 bit) with Windows 7 home preloaded.\nUbuntu 8.10 will install on it but Ubuntu 12.04 won't as it doesn't recognize a hard drive.\nAs a test I reloaded with XP Pro SP3, but Ubuntu 12.04 still won't find a hard drive.\nIs there a fix?\nDisk /dev/sda: 80.0 GB, 80026361856 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9729 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x75bfd462\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *           1        9327    74919096   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2            9328        9729     3229065    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5            9328        9729     3229033+  82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\n\nA: Wild guess, have you tried to remake the label on the disk ( right click new master boot record) and then partitioned on a 4k alignment? I recall that parted was doing something weird back then and if it didn't hit the alignment it would break. It might also be the case that on such old drives, one of the important sections of the disk where the partition holds metadata might have a bad sector. One way of checking would be to use ctrl+alt+F2, after you initiate the format, drop into console and type dmesg and see if it complains of bad sectors. If it does, then the disk is bad.\nLook for something similar to: \n   [Sun Jul 21 13:36:32 2013] ata4.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x1 SErr 0x0 action 0x0\n   [Sun Jul 21 13:36:32 2013] ata4.00: irq_stat 0x40000008 \n   [Sun Jul 21 13:36:32 2013] ata4.00: failed command: READ FPDMA QUEUED \n   [Sun Jul 21 13:36:32 2013] ata4.00: cmd 60/20:00:2c:eb:7e/00:00:08:00:00/40 tag 0 ncq 16384 in \n   [Sun Jul 21 13:36:32 2013] res 41/40:00:2f:eb:7e/00:00:08:00:00/40 Emask 0x409 (media error) &lt;F&gt; \n   [Sun Jul 21 13:36:32 2013] ata4.00: status: { DRDY ERR } \n   [Sun Jul 21 13:36:32 2013] ata4.00: error: { UNC } \n\n", "Q: How to shutdown the computer after Xsession ends?

(It did not ask me for 'logical' or 'primary' partitions or anything like that, I guess because that was handled in the prior mac partition!) This vid will visually (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssKpGeJ--UY) give you a great idea on how to do it!!!

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on a Dell XPS-12 laptop, in Mozilla Firefox, with no extensions running.\nFor some reason, Firefox has been taking sections of readable text out of the pages I've been visiting. It's happened on other ones as well, but this page is so simple that I thought it would be best to isolate the problem here: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/why-shell.html\nSo down where it says \"Procedures involving heavy-duty math operations, especially floating point arithmetic, arbitrary precision calculations, or complex numbers (use C++ or FORTRAN instead)\", I can't actually see the \"C++\" or \"FORTRAN\" words - they're just not there. I opened up the Inspector and saw that the words were wrapped in  elements, but that shouldn't do anything, should it?\nAnyone have any thoughts as to why this is happening?\n\nA: The text on this page has no associated font. Therefore Firefox will substitute the default font that you set in the Options. However, the words C++ and Fortran are between italic tags. If there is an italic version of your default font installed on your system, Firefox will use that; otherwise, I guess Firefox gets confused. Thetefore, install an italic version of the default font, or choose another default font (in Options/Content) and see if the text reappears.\n", "Q: How To fix a PPTP VPN client connection (Ubuntu on VirtualBox) I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on VirtualBox and I'm trying to set up a VPN client.

Under Ubuntu 14.04, the trackpoint buttons (now again physical as opposed to X240) do not work properly. Left Button scrolls up, right button scrolls down, middle button does nothing.\nHow to resolve this issue?\n\nA: The problem is that Xorg will use the synaptics driver, which is not yet capable of handling the new hardware correctly. This can be circumvented by using evdev, and forcing the psmouse module, which takes care of the device at kernel-level, to recognize the device as legacy ImPS mouse.\nNo need to update your kernel, this works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the file /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf with the following contents:\noptions psmouse proto=imps\n\n*Add the file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-evdev.conf:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Touchpad/TrackPoint\"\n    MatchProduct \"PS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\n    MatchDriver \"evdev\"\n    Option \"EmulateWheel\" \"1\"\n    Option \"EmulateWheelButton\" \"2\"\n    Option \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"0\"\n    Option \"XAxisMapping\" \"6 7\"\n    Option \"YAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\n\n*(May be optional; it is in Mint, it is not in Kubuntu) Update your initramfs to actually enforce loading the psmouse module correctly:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nNote: This solution works without updating your kernel. I have verified this with Linux Mint 17.1 64bit (kernel 3.13), Ubuntu 14.10 and Kubuntu 14.10 (both kernel 3.16). However, I also completely disabled the touchpad in the Lenovo BIOS. Disabling it there has no consequences without the instructions above, but is enforced when evdev is used as X driver, rather than synaptics.\nStep (3) is not covered by the original blogpost at vimtips. Also, the code listing there has a typo (YAcisMapping).\nEdit: Touchpad and Trackpoint, both are working out of the box (with synaptics) as of Ubuntu 15.04 (including all flavors).\n\nA: This solution works:\nhttp://vimtips.org/2015/02/20/ubuntu-1410-and-lenovo-thinkpad-x250/\n1.) update kernel 3.18.7\n2.) create file psmouse.conf then edit trackpoint buttons\n\nA: The problem is gone with Ubuntu 15.04.

I have samba set up and configured, and has been running for many months.  My wife has a Dell 1545, windows 7 home 64 bit laptop.  She tried to access the ubuntu shares and could not.  Not sure when this stopped but all other ubuntu machines can access the shares.  Tried lots of stuff on the windows side to no avail.  Out of curiosity, I disabled the wireless and connected the laptop to the ethernet port.  Low and behold, I could now access the shares!  What do I configure to allow the WiFi connection to work? Its a Dell 1397 WLAN mini-card.\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nA: Problem solved.  Windows is gone and Gnome Ubuntu has taken its place.  Should have done it long ago.

Not putting any more effort into windows, we are now an Ubuntu family.\n", "Q: Is there any way to turn off a USB HDD manually? I have a USB-powered external HDD connected to my DELL laptop. Some times, after clicking on \"Safely remove\" item in pop-up menu of its icon in side bar, the drive is un-mounted and is removed from /dev/ folder (sdb and sdb1 both are removed) and lsusb do not show the device, but the HDD remains spinning and I could sense the vibration by putting my finger on it. But some times a few second after clicking on \"Safely remove\", it stops spinning and has no vibration. Is there any way (may be a CLI command) to turn it off?\n\nA: Try the Disks utility - that should be on your menu somewhere (in my case under Accessories). You can also launch it from a terminal by running \ngnome-disks\n\n... then select the disk and you will see a power button at top-right of the window, with tooltip \"Power off the drive\".\n\nA: If your desktop does something fishy, you cal always fallback on the terminal.\nsudo umount /dev/sdXY\n# (this will umount, it will complain on opened files, if so lsof and see which ones.)\nsudo sync  \n# ( this flushes all buffers to disk. It will ensure that no data is lingering in ram.)\nsudo eject /dev/sdX\n# ( this works on dvd/cds and some, not all usb devices, it detaches the device from the port. Some devices \"get smart\" and try to reset and readd themselves to the disk, however all caches are clean and safe to unplug).\n\nOn the other hand, once a device is unidentified as a block device on USB, then you can use sdparm or hdparm on that device to park the heads if so desired, however using such tools will not flash buffers. And if you forget that the device is sleeping and yank the power, then you can corrupt your data. \n\nA: Try this:\nudisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdXY\nudisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdX\n\non Linux Mint or Ubuntu\n\nA: Running hdparm -y /dev/sdb as root will cause the disk to stop spinning. If anything access the disk, it will spin up again.\nThe man page suggest this is only useful for IDE drives. However I have tested that it does work with a USB drive attached to a Dell running 14.04. The man page says the command will usually cause the drive to spin down, which suggests some drives exist which will not spin down when this command is issued.\n\nA: Unplug the USB cable should do it.  If not, then plug it back in and safely remove it again until it stays off.\n\nA: This is how I do that on Linux Mint 17.3\n\n\n*\n\n*List your drives with partitions and make sure you select proper drive\nlsblk\n\n\n*Unmount all mounted partitions of the disk, for example with this command pattern\nsudo umount /dev/sdXY\n\nwhere X is your drive letter and Y a partition number you want to unmount.\n\n*Stop hdd\nudisks --detach /dev/sdX\n\n\n*Unplug USB cable\n\nA: I have three equally valid solutions from which you can take your pick.\nMy personal solution is to buy a use hub featuring a power switch for each port.  I find it amazingly handy.  If I recall, it cost only about $6 on amazon.  I'll see if I can find you the item for sale before I post this, but it is enough to tell you such an affordable device exists.  Found it!\nIn this other discussion it was determined that there is a terminal command which can be used to literally disable power from select usb ports.  The question came up because the user who asked the question was using a battery operated tablet and his inconsiderate cow-orkers were plugging their cell phones in to charge, thus running down his battery.  Check out the bloke who discovered the solution! ;-)\nFinally, depending perhaps on the brand and features of said drive, there should be a \"spin down\" command you can send to the drive before unmounting it.  I've never manually used such a command but back in the days of DOS, before energy saving features were common place, that was how you had to do it, so it stands to reason there's a way to do it today, and figuring it out may be as easy as writing to the drive manufacturer, looking at their website, or googling the correct question, ie \"spin-down command for hard drives\".  I do not stand by the following solution.  I did a casual search and found this.  Your mileage may vary.  Do let me know if it works for you.\n", "Q: How to free up my laptop's RAM? I have an old DELL laptop with 2GB of RAM and Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit) as its OS. Many times I am out of RAM and thus every thing goes very slow! I think there is many background programs (services or daemons) which are not used by me at all. Is there any way to find those programs and force them not to start automatically on system reboot?\n\nA: While I respect you intend to only ask one question, how to not load software you don't need, I perceive you to be asking two questions, the other, or primary one, how to make a computer run better with only 2gb of RAM.  I would like very much to answer that question as I suspect I can help.\nAs you probably know, by default all Ubuntu installations configure some amount of \"swap space\" on the hard drive, and for most people, that amount is adequate.  For most people 2gb of RAM is adequate as well.  I suspect that your main problem isn't simply that you are running out of RAM, but that you are also running out of swap space.  There are two ways to solve that and one is much easier to accomplish, though the other is probably easier on your RAM situation.\nEither manually expand your swap partition.\nor\nInstall this Dynamic Swap Space Manager.\nThe latter has been my preferred solution for most people, mainly because it permits you to use as much of your drive for swap space as your drive allows, but it doesn't permanently tie up any of your drive as a dedicated swap partition.\nThere is one more thing you might do, but only if it applies to you:\nIF you are running the 64 bit version of Ubuntu 14.04, please downgrade to the 32bit version.  It is my impression that the 64 bit version uses or wastes memory at about a 2:1 ratio as compared to the 32 bit version.\n", "Q: Losing KDE desktop when switching This is probably something simple but it's quite frustrating.\nI have KDE set up to have two desktops set under \"System Settings->Virtual Desktops\". I can type ctrl-left and ctrl-right to switch between them no problem.\nIf I type \"window-tab\", however, I appear to switch to another desktop... and I can even do it twice and get to a 3rd desktop. But, I can never get back to my main one. In fact the only way I've ever been able to get back to my primary one is finding an app in the system tray that's on my main desktop, and telling it to focus.\nAny idea what might be going on here? I have a feeling I've got two different virtual-desktop schemes running at once, I just don't know what the \"windows tab\" command is invoking.\n\nA: You are probably switching activities with that key combination. \nTry looking at the global keyboard shortcut management (should come up if you type key in the alt+f2-dialog), and then choose plasma desktop from the dropdown menu. I have something like \"next activity\" there, which in my case is mapped on meta+tab. Getting back should be meta+shift+tab, so just try windows+shift+tab on your keyboard to get back. \nIf you want to, you can also disable the shortcut from the same menu. \n", "Q: How to set a permanent IP address on \"Snappy\" Ubuntu Core I'm trying to use \"Snappy\" Ubuntu Core on a virtual environment (virt-manager) but I didn't see any guide to explain how to set a permanent IP address on Snappy.

It would look like:\ndbus-launch --exit-with-session nmcli dev disconnect iface eth0\n\nApparently, this only works for the root user.\nThe other way is more direct:\nsudo ip link set down dev eth0\n\nUsed in root's crontab, or in /etc/crontab, the sudo wouldn't be required.\n", "Q: VirtualBox 4.3.22 with Windows 8.1 x64 sharing folder I'm trying to install Windows 8.1 x64 in a virtual machine.\nThe problem is that I can enable the function to share a folder between host and guest.\nI followed the steps in this link: http://www.itworld.com/article/2696611/open-source-tools/install-virtualbox-4-3-14-in-ubuntu-14-04.html\nI created a folder to share in /home/\"my name\"/ and when logged in the guest, I installed the guest addition that came in \"CD Drive (D:) VirtualBox Guest Additions\" under Devices and drives (The amd64 version).\nWhen I click on \"map network drive\" and then browse to open the folder I'd like to share, it doesn't appear.

The post also says that installing on a Lenovo laptop is NOT possible. However, I doubt this. I would like you to present you all details and show you how far I got and where i'm stuck.\nDual boot on a Lenovo B50-70 laptop. OEM version of Win8.1 64 bit.\nBios UEFI mode on, Secure Boot on.\nAll preparations done like partitioning and Win shut-down without fast start up.\nLiveUSB with Ubuntu 14.04.1 64 bit, created with Unetbootin.\nI use a USB 2.0 connector, not a USB 3.0.\nMy first attempt failed because Ubuntu was installed in BIOS mode. The BIOS setting for UEFI was off. I used boot-repair but that didn't work so I used Lenovo's recovery to restore everything and Windows booted again.\nI turned on UEFI and tried again.\nIn my second attempt Widows started right away ignoring the LiveUSB. This was because of the boot order. In BIOS the Win and USB device was visible. Setting the boot priority or directly by the boot menu made the GRUB bootloder start.\nOn startup I got a GRUB menu\nGrub had just one entry which is a little confusing: \"Boot-Repair-Disk session\". I used the USB stick previously for Boot-Repair but then wrote the Ubuntu iso to it. Anyway when I select it, Ubuntu booted.\nThe dark purple Ubuntu screen showed and made me think every thing would be ok, but after some time the purple screen is replaced by:\nBusyBox V1.21.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.21.0-1ubuntu1) built-in shell (ash)\n(initramfs) unable to find a medium containing a live file system\n\nAt this point I'm stuck.\nIf I check where I am, I can see a file system with dev,root,var,inti etc. etc.\nThere are 2 filesystems: udev and tmpfs.\nThe file casper.log shows the same error as shown above.\nIs there a way by entering commands in the Grub menu or in the BusyBox shell that I can start the LiveUSB?\nMy first guess was that Secure boot generally prevents booting of any other OS and also the LiveUSB. However, turning Secure boot off in BIOS has NO effect....\nI am open to all suggestions. Even if GRUB must be started by the Windows bootloader.\n\nA: YES PROBLEM SOLVED!!!\nBut in a very silly way.\nI'm eager to tell you. It is because of a bug in: Startup disk creator.\nAs I told I'm using startup disk creator to create a bootable USB.\nI MUST use a 64 bit version of Ubuntu but I also had downloaded the image:\nubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\n\nWhen starting Startup disk creator in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS BOTH images were present:\nubuntu-14.10-desktop-amd64.iso\nubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\n\nIn Startup disk creator you can click the button: \"other\" to select the image you want.\nI selected the amd64 version, not the i386 version. Then ran into trouble described above. If there are 2 images in the storage location just one image will be selected no matter which image you select. In the standard screen of Startup disk creator it is not visible unless you make the window wider.\nI tried several times, yes, it is reproducible. There is no version visible. It came with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nWorkaround\nRemove or rename the image you do not want from you download directory and everything will be fine.\nImage burning to USB and installing worked perfectly.\nThe only thin I'm puzzled of is why the 64bit amd image is working on a Lenovo B50-70 with Intel core i3. But that is another question. However, I can confirm that it works!\nIt works perfectly and is super fast!!!\nHappy with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: My Uninstall of Ubuntu 14.04 from Windows 8.1 messed up using EasyBCD I started with a pre-installed Windows 8.1 Lenovo with one-key recovery.

Here's how you can boot from the GRUB terminal:\nhttp://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/776643-how-to-rescue-a-non-booting-grub-2-on-linux/\nAfter you get into Ubutnu, you can fix GRUB by installing and running boot-repair:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\nsudo boot-repair\n\nThen select the recommended fix.\nIf you want to skip GRUB and boot into your windows partition:\nGo into your computer setup and change your boot order to boot from Windows partition first by pressing F2, ESC, or whichever button it is for your board.\nAlternatively\nHaving installed, reinstalled, and rearranging partitions all day for the past few days, here's what I found the easiest way to do it. NOTE: THIS WILL WIPE ALL DATA FROM YOUR UBUNTU PARTITION, SO MAKE A BACKUP.\nBoot from a live installation disk and run gparted. (Unmount your hard disk if it's mounted) Delete the Ubutnu partition(s) and create new partition(s) how you want to arrange them. Hit \"Apply\", exit the application, and run the installer.

At least the BSSIDs, and hopefully ESSIDs as well.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: If you are network-manager (default) then you will find all the connections in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory.\nOpen the file based on the connection name you want to check and you will find all the relevant information in the file.\n\nA: Using the nmcli utility, you can get information about Network-Manager's previously-established network connections e.g.\nnmcli con list\n\nTo limit the output to specific fields of interest, you can do something like\nnmcli -f NAME,TIMESTAMP-REAL con list\n\nwhich lists the connection name and time of last connection. You can also do more specific queries by connection ID or UUID e.g.\nnmcli -f 802-11-wireless con list id \"NETGEAR68-5G\"\n\n(quotes not mandatory unless the name contains spaces or other special characters), where in this case NETGEAR68-5G is the name of one of the previously-established connections as returned by the basic nmcli con list command. In this case, the 802-11-wireless field should include SSID, and BSSID if available.\n", "Q: Wine 1.6 USB Mouse Detection I have a Perixx MX3000 mouse with 5 fully customizable profiles with different speeds, colors, and button binding. The problem is, its software is not made for Linux based operating systems, so I installed it in Wine (1.6). When I tried to launch the software to configure my mouse, it tells me that the mouse is not detected.\nThe mouse is still using the profile I set on Windows perfectly because the ctrl+C, ctrl+P, volume up, volume down, and show desktop buttons work perfectly. How can I make the software detect my mouse? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Running the configuration software in Wine doesn't help, because it expects the Windows hardware drivers to be present. You will need to find working Linux drivers for your device.\nGenerally speaking, anything that involves direct hardware or driver access doesn't work in Wine.\n", "Q: Opening a terminal from 14.04 Installation Disk Does anybody know of a way to open a Terminal from the Ubuntu 14.04 Installation Disk? If so, is there a way to format a drive / clean it from then? Any help is very much appreciated!\n\nA: To open a Terminal from the disk, choose \"test Ubuntu\" and just do as you would regularly Ctrl+Alt+T. You can still install Ubuntu from the test Ubuntu option.\nIf you want to format, clean, or partition your drive, you should use gparted which you can launch by typing sudo gparted and entering your password or running it from your applications. If you continue with your installation, you can also change/wipe/partition your hard drive using the \"Other\" method of installation, or just continue with the regular installation method and it will automatically do the partitioning.\n", "Q: what is playback speed in ubuntu's default movie player I have a movie which has been recorded by a digital cam at 1000 fps.

I then tried to install GRUB manually with a Live USB, but that never worked.\nI eventually gave up and decided to just do the installation once again on just one 4TB hard drive with no RAID. This time, it had no errors, but when I finished, I got an Intel PXE error message saying it couldn't find any bootable device. I checked the BIOS and unplugged all other drives to make sure it is booting to the right drive.\nI used the Live USB to run boot-repair with recommended repair, which said it ran successfully, and still got the same error. I then ran boot-repair with advanced settings for manual configuration. During this process it asked me to paste a command into the Terminal which then asked which drives to install GRUB on. Any partition on this list comes back with an error saying that the GRUB couldn't be installed to the partition.\nWhat on earth is going on? I'm going to have to switch to Windows Server 2012 at this rate. As much as I hate Windows, it's still better than this.\n\nA: I have determined that this was an issue with the motherboard and not with Ubuntu Server. I had tried many settings on the BIOS to get it working (UEFI on/off fast boot on/off, secure boot on/off), but nothing worked. When I took the drive to my main computer, it worked perfectly on my newer Asus motherboard. I guess this Intel board doesn't like 4TB hard drives.\n", "Q: apt-get install proxy problem: no such file or directory I can't seem to install anything using apt.

Every once in a while, I get a dialog box asking me to input the password to MYHOME123, which usually resolves itself when I disconnect and then reconnect back to the same network.\nIn spite of this, I still find MYHOME123 1 and MYHOME123 2 in my drop-down Wi-Fi network menu, and examining the network settings shows that only one of the MYHOME* networks has the password I set. All of the others have no password, which I assume is the reason why I could connect to them.\nWhat's even stranger is that this problem is non-existent when I try to connect using a windows or mac os machine, which leads me to believe that it could be an Ubuntu glitch. Has anyone experienced this before? What's the reason behind it?\n\nA: This is a universal problem with WiFi auto-configuration:\nIt happens under Windows and Ubuntu and seems to happen when a network goes out of range and then comes back.  (Sorry, no experience with fruity variations on the same theme)\nThe only time I never had this happen was on a console-only server without network-manager nor wicd, but this was my sole sample so that one could be anecdotal.\n", "Q: How to scroll to the top of the terminal buffer with a keyboard shortcut?

In that case, AFAIK, no. As an aside, CTRL-ALT PgUp or PgDn will let you scroll one line at a time. \n", "Q: How can I disable Windows 8 Fast Boot if I don't have Windows 8? I've been searching around for this for a while, but I haven't found anyone else with the same problem.  Guess no one made the same stupid mistake.\nI have a Windows 7/Ubuntu computer that is suffering from Windows 8 Fast Boot.  I can see how this might be an uncommon problem to have, so I've written out how I managed to get myself into this predicament below.\nI'm on an Alienware 14 that originally had Windows 7.  I installed a second hard drive and got Ubuntu working on it no problem.  I didn't think I touched the original hard drive at all, but when I was done, Windows was refusing to boot.  I tried to fix it and eventually gave up.  It wasn't a big deal.  All my stuff was backed up for that reason anyway.  So then, I tried to reinstall Windows from a recovery USB key I have by going through the BIOS boot menu, but the computer wouldn't boot from the recovery flash drive unless I picked the UEFI option.  I went ahead and reinstalled using the UEFI option and Windows was working fine again, so I thought \"this is great!\"  I then went back into BIOS and disabled the Legacy ROM thing.  An option for Windows 8 Fast Boot was now available and enabled by default.  I turned it off because I didn't want it, but then turned it on again later, not realizing it would cause great harm.\nNow, through a great series of steps, I have Ubuntu installed on the first hard drive rather than the second (which is not a problem) and a Windows 7 installation that can't boot or repair or do anything on the second.  I want to reinstall this Windows 7, but I have no way to access BIOS or EFI or whatever the correct term is.  Because of the enabled Windows 8 Fast Boot, there is no option to enter BIOS on startup, and I don't have Windows 8 to turn off the setting.  I've tried pulling my laptop completely apart to unplug the CMOS battery.  That didn't work.  It still doesn't let me get to my BIOS on startup.\n\nA: Usually there is a service key or shortcut that resets the BIOS/UEFI to defaults, e.g. hold PgUp while switching the power on. You could maybe google whether such a key is existing for your machine or UEFI.\nOnce that is done, you will be able to access the BIOS again!\n", "Q: Where to add the Pre-Shared Key for the Server Authentication with Network Manager for L2TP/IPSEC? \nPreviously, I was trying to figure out how to install the L2TP/IPSEC manager code. I guess Ubuntu/Canonical switched away from OpenSwan to StrongSwan, but didn't really announce it. So that was figured out in this AskUbuntu question: L2TP IPsec VPN client on Ubuntu 14.10\nSince then, I've been trying to figure out how to use Pre-Shared Keys for Authentication to the Server. As shown in the screenshot, the Network Manager allows for a Certificate (.pem file), but not a Pre-shared key.\nMy network admin doesn't want to mess around with Certs because PSKs are good enough for the situation we're working with. I've already tested these PSKs with Windows and they work great.\nHe's given me 4 pieces of info.\n\n\n*\n\n*Server name\n\n*PSK for said server\n\n*User name\n\n*password for said username\n\n\nI can see on this screenshot where to put the server name and username, but cannot see where to put the PSK for the server, nor where to enter the password (maybe I'm prompted for that at connection time.)\nAnyone know how to do this?\nUPDATE: So I tried hackerb9's suggestion, but it didn't appear to do anything. I also tried alci's suggestion of downloading the 1.3.1 version of Network-Manager for L2TP and compiling manually. After installing a bunch of packages and re-running ./configure a few times, I eventually was able to \"make\" and then \"make install\" the code.\nThe plug-in for network manager now shows a Pre-shared Key option, but it still doesn't work. It now looks like this:\n\nThe problem with this is that the \"Certificate\" option is still being displayed (instaed of the Pre-shared key field.)\nWhere in this Ubuntu Network Manager plugin am I supposed to enter the Pre-shared Key for Server authentication?\nAs an example for contrast, in Windows 8, it has an option that looks like this:\n\n\nA: If you want a GUI solution, you can install an L2TP Network Manager plugin from ppa.\nIt can be done by\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nm-l2tp/network-manager-l2tp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-l2tp-gnome\n\nIt works with trusty and xenial, but the author did not build packages for vivid.\nAfter you install the package you will be able to configure an L2TP connection in Network Manager\nUpdate: Now the packages have been included in official Ubuntu repositories and PPA is not needed for Ubuntu 18.04+.\nFor new Ubuntu releases just run:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-l2tp-gnome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Are you comfortable with editing configuration files with a text editor? If so, I believe the answer of where to put the PSK is /etc/ipsec.secrets. You can try something like this:\n: PSK \"strongSwan\" \n\nThe file is documented in man ipsec.secrets or you can read about it here:\nhttps://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IpsecSecrets\nLet us know if that doesn't work for you.\n", "Q: version upgrade from 14.04 to 14.10 / Ubuntu tutorial for beginners When I installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, to upgrade to the latest version (14.10), I\n    used the following terminal commands:\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get upgrade \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAfter I finished this, it seems strange to me:\nI did not need to download the newest Ubuntu iso file and install it,\nI have just typed these terminal commands!\nIs this right?\n\nA: The commands you posted above are not enough to change to a newer release of the distro.\nThe recommended command to move to a new release is:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nThis should start the process of downloading and installing the new release version, however it will only move to a stable release. If the release you want to move to is still classed as in the development stage, you'll need to append the -d option.\nIf you want to check which version is currently installed on your system use:\nlsb_release -a\n\nThis will produce a 5 line output, detailing which exact version of Ubuntu you're using, don't panic when the output starts with the line 'No LSB modules are available', that's perfectly normal.\nSo your best move is to use the lsb command first to check what version you're on, then if it still says 14.04, issue the do-release-upgrade command.

I know this because I can change the colors and see the corresponding \"darkgreen\" (or whichever color I am selecting) font change to whatever color I changed it to. \nSo whenever I specify a colorscheme, it has the general look and appearance of it, but it's not exactly correct. I would like to have my color schemes look how they do in the screenshots I see of them.\nIs it possible to do this or will I always have to manually change the 16 colors in my Profile Preferences to perfectly match a colorscheme?\nI'm using the vim-gnome package in Ubuntu 14.04 with gnome-terminal. Thanks for any help.\n\nA: This is working in gnome-terminal + vim on Ubuntu 14.04:\nFirstly, set the bash setting as the end of ~/.bashrc file like this:\nif [ -n \"$DISPLAY\" -a \"$TERM\" == \"xterm\" ]; then\n    export TERM=xterm-256color\nfi\n\nNext, set the vim setting at the end of ~/.vimrc file like this:\nif $COLORTERM == 'gnome-terminal'\n  set t_Co=256\nendif\n\nYou will need to load a new terminal to see these have an effect. You may run the python script to test is the bash setting has taken effect and then testing vim's support, which I believe was the core issue above:\nInstall a 256 color vim theme by downloading the script and saving it to ~/.vim/colors/inkpot.vim and enable it with this command:\n:colo inkpot\n\nYou should see a theme which when tested locally does not change when gnome-terminal's colours are changed. You can make these themes permanent by adding the command to your .vimrc file.\nMore information about vim colours can be found on their website.\n", "Q: Unable to use microphone I have Asus X550L model, and using latest build Ubuntu.

Trying to put 14.04 on an older Toshiba Satellite (L775). Told it to erase the harddrive. It's been giving me the spinny circle and no progress bars or anything for going on four hours now. I could imagine that it might take that long or longer, because I had a lot of stuff on that harddrive. But I have no idea, really. Couldn't seem to find this anywhere. Thanks.\nAlso if it's broken what the heck do I do.\n\nA: This is a bad sign.

I have a USB-powered external HDD connected to my DELL laptop. Some times, after clicking on \"Safely remove\" item in pop-up menu of its icon in side bar, the drive is un-mounted and is removed from /dev/ folder (sdb and sdb1 both are removed) and lsusb do not show the device, but the HDD remains spinning and I could sense the vibration by putting my finger on it. But some times a few seconds after clicking on \"Safely remove\", it stops spinning and has no vibration. Is there any way (may be a CLI command or a script) to force the drive stop spinning every time after \"Safely remove\"?\nI know that hdparm could stop spinning, but works while drive is connected, but I need a way that works after \"Safely remove\"!\nNote:\nWhen I safely removed the drive I want to keep it plugged-in but not-spinning and not-mounted. Because The access to my laptop USB port is somewhat hard when I fixed my laptop on my desk which is full of extra things and widgets! and also may be I forgot to disconnect the USB port! Considering this, there are two reasons for wanting the drive not-spinning after unmount:  \n\n\n*\n\n*If I run laptop on battery, spinning drive uses more energy!  \n\n*If I suddenly take-off my laptop or move it, there may be a damage\nto connected USB-cable or even to the HDD (which is now spinning)!\n\n\nA: Depending on what you are trying to do, I am guessing what it looks like to me that when you are done with the drive you want to keep it plugged in but not mounted.\nSo what I would advise you to do is to open the menu and search \"Disks\" (Ubuntu 14.04/10) if your disk is there, instead of clicking Safely remove I would just click on the pause button on that drive.\nBecause, it you did not know this, I will tell you that the Safely Removal tool does not do anything beneficial, just as long as your not transferring files it is fine to un-mount it. \nAlso because the safely removal does is just gets your drive ready for unplugging it. Which in this case you are not, as I take it from what you are asking in this question.\nHopefully I could be some help!\n", "Q: AWS EC2 set up key and non key authentication at same time I want to set up password based authentication (non key) on AWS EC2 ubuntu instance.

I love it so far. It's very fast and all. The only absolute one thing that really annoys me is the \"out-of-shape\" osd which is used for notifications. I haven't seen anything as ugly as this. I wouldn't mind if it takes to removing it, but I definately don't want it there. Any work-around? Here is an Image.\n\nA: That's not how the panel is intended to look - this is a known bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lubuntu-artwork/+bug/1362555 (If you know how to use launchpad, please feel free to report that this bug also affects you.)\nThis file: /usr/share/themes/Lubuntu-default/gtk-2.0/images/panel-bg.png is the background of that notification and is tiled.\nYou could try removing that file or replacing that file with an image of your choice.

This is actually quite a common problem when upgrading. Drivers usually get mixed up and thing don't work right. Can you tell me how many times you've upgraded your computer? The more it's upgraded, th more broken drivers there can be. \nAnyway, try going to: Settings -> Drivers (at the bottom) -> and find your Wi-Fi adapter driver. If it's not there, chances are it's corrupted or not installed. There are a lot of possibilities for that, so I'll try do dive into that in the meantime.\nCheers, Daniel\n\nA: The fastest way to resolve this issue is to plug in your ethernet cord (it looks like a telephone wire, but wider) into your router. But that would restrict you from moving away from the router. Otherwise, it would definitely be a better idea to do a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.01.2 LTS (for average users) or 14.10 (for more experienced users), because Ubuntu 13.10 is already pretty outdated and unsupported. Doing a fresh install will clear all your old and broken drivers from previous installs and start fresh. If you don't know how or just want to upgrade, it may require some more investigation involving searching through you system folders and installing drivers manually, which is not an easy task. Of course, it could be that your wireless adapter is broken from wear and tear, which is common in old computers.

I should like to know how much space I have to reserve for swap and system to keep my PC quick and with enough memory to install a  lot of programs.\n\nA: 0 bytes is the perfect swap size - that is do not create a swap partition and do not bother with swap at all. If you ever find this is indeed a problem (I never have), then create a swap file - with a swap file it is easy to experiment with the right size (half of your RAM size to start with and then up to 2 times that).\n\nA: It depends on your use case.  \n\n\n*\n\n*If you're a very light user that only ever had one tab open in FireFox (forget about chromium) only uses two applications at a time (like Firefox and Thunderbirdand that doesn't need hibernation: No swap necessary.\n\n*medium user: With only 2GB of RAM, I would put in a 4GB swap so you can have multiple tabs open (and individual tabs will be swapped out) and 3-6 applications open.

Works with NFS too if lockd is used.\n#  flock  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.\n#  lockf  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.\n#\n# You can use multiple locking methods; if you do the order they're declared\n# in is important to avoid deadlocks if other MTAs/MUAs are using multiple\n# locking methods as well.

never see email show up for non-user accounts. root and postmaster, while valid users, are typically blocked out in Postfix other than for internal (localhost) emails\n\nIt led me on the right track to solve the issue. \nI added a new user and used alias to route all mails to root to that user.\nI now recieve the emails :D\n", "Q: Limit bandwidth for background applications on slow network When I am at slow and/or paid networks (i.e. in public transport wifi of while tethering) I want to browse as fast as possible, so I don't want Ubuntu to download software updates, torrents, etc.\nThere are many apps that monitor or limit applications, but I can't find an app that works like the 'disable background usage' or 'disable while not on wifi or while roaming' like Android has. I would be great to have an app that disables/limit certain applications when the wifi network is considered as a slow/expensive network.\n\nA: Just create a firewall profile that blocks everything except http and dns and set your update mirror to one that only accepts the ftp protocol:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firewall configuration:\napt-get install gufw\n\nNow go to the dash, and type firewall and click the sole icon remaining and you'll see:\n\nBegin warning: From now on, until you see End warning, you will not have access to the Internet!\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the \"public\" profile (or another one you're currently now using) and set everything to \"reject\" (as in the picture above)\n\n*Click the + below \"rules\" and click on the \"Simple\" tab and fill out the screen as follows:\n\n\n\nand press Add\nThen fill out the screen as follows:\n\nand press Add, then Close\nEnd Warning\nYour rules section should now look like this:\n\n\n\n*Mirror config\n\n\nIn the Netherlands, there is only one mirror that supports ftp only: Ftpserv-tudelft-nl, for all other countries, look here for the full list and choose your own.\nNow go to the dash again and type Software Updater and again, click the sole icon available, click Settings, the \"Ubuntu Software\" tab, \"Download from:\" and choose Other, take the country of your choice and the server of your choice:\n\nAnd voilà: you can only surf the Internet and nothing else can happen any more! No updates, no email, no Skype, no FTP, no HTTPS, no nothing! Only DNS look-ups and web surfing  If you would like to have more then the absolute minimal available, have a look at IANA assigned port numbers and add any other protocol numbers you would need.\n\nTo revert back to normal use:  just open the firewall in the dash again, Click on Public and then click on Home and you're back to where you were!\n", "Q: install Ubuntu 14.10 and windows 8.1 on new ssd I upgraded my HDD to a 1Tb SSD. I want to install both Ubuntu 14.10 and Windows 8.1 on it, with 60% of the SSD for Ubuntu. \nBut I don't know how make the partitions or how many partitions I need, or which OS I should install first.\n\nA: It is usually best to install Windows first as it will replace the bootloader and you would be unable to boot Ubuntu without loading a live-usb/disc to fix the bootloader.\nOn Windows setup proceed until you get to the installation type window and select Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) and it should display the screen below. Now select the Unallocated Space on your new SSD and click on the New icon and enter the number of Megabytes you want to allocate to Windows (In your case it would be 40% of the SSD) and click on apply. Windows will now create your primary partition as well as between 1 and 4 extra partition for system data and Recovery etc depending on whether you install in UEFI mode or not. After the partitions are created select the Primary partition by clicking on it and select Next and go though the normal installation process.\n\nAfter the Windows installation is complete insert your Ubuntu live-usb/disk and follow the instructions until you get to the window below. The quickest option here would be to select Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8 which will use all of the unallocated space left on the SSD to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8 but if you want to fine-tune the process select Something else\n\nFrom here you are able to create separate partitions for your root and home data which can be a huge advantage as it is possible to reinstall Ubuntu while keeping all of your user files and preferences intact.\nBelow is an screen capture of my current setup. The system is partitioned in UEFI mode which means that Secure Boot is enabled and is why I have an EFI boot, recovery, and other NTFS system data partitions created by Windows during the installation process. If you installed in Legacy mode you'd have a System Reserved partition instead of EFI boot, etc as well as the main primary Windows partition.\nOn the Linux side I have partitioned 18.65 GiB at ext4 as the root partition for Linux, a separate partition for user data at 437.77 GiB as the home partition and a linux-swap partition at 7.45 GiB.\n\nTo allocate separate partitions for root and home all you need to do is select the free space on the SSD and click on the + sign to the bottom left of the window to open the window below and configure the root partition with your preferred size (15-20 GBs is usually the recommended for value) and set it as Ext 4 Journalling file system, now do the same for the home partition but leave some extra space for the swap partition (it is recommended for the swap to be around the same value as your system memory), now use all of the free space left on the SSD but select swap area instead of an Ext4. From here the system should be ready to install Ubuntu with separate root and home partitions.\n\n\nA: The short answer to your question is: Install Windows first.\nHere's an atricle that describes the procedure:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\nMentioned there is also the reason: The Windows bootloader is not aware of existing installations of other operation systems and the whole disc will be wiped during installation.\nAnother thing to mention is secure boot - you might need to turn that feature off in the bios. See this question for more information on that topic. \nAfter the windows installation finished you can start the installation of ubuntu. You will be asked which partition to install to. Choose manual partitioning and set the size as needed (see the article for detailed description).\nIf you have problems starting windows after the partition has been resized see here for a fix.\n\nA: The first OS should be WINDOWS since Ubuntu provides a lot more options while installing as it can work on NTFS file system too.\nSo first simply install windows 8.1 as you normally would.\nDon't worry about partitioning while installing since you can bend it your will later as described in the link below, just remember to give your OS drive as much space you wish while installing cause you don't wanna play with it later for safety.\nThen follow the instructions in the following link \nThis link will tell you all about partitioning and BIOS settings for secure boot.\n", "Q: Problem in QT Quick Test for QML application I have a problem in QT Quick Test for QML application, when I add import in my file.qml like:\nimport QtQuick 2.3\nimport QtTest 1.0\nimport ValueField 1.0   <---\nimport \"../myFile.qml\"   <--- \n\nTestCase{\n\nmyFile{\nid: \n}\n\n}: \n\nWhen I execute my project, I have this problem:\nmodule \"ValueField\" is not installed\n\n\nA: There's no Ubuntu packages in the repositories providing ValueField.qml.\nI'd just remove the import ValueField 1.0 line in your test file.\n", "Q: Sleep time variable from file? I am wanting to know is it possible to have sleep in a bash script have a variable time that is read from a file? I am wanting to perform operations in the script that vary in length that will have the timings set by another script.\n\nA: To sleep the number of seconds specified in timeout.txt file:\n#!/bin/sh\nread timeout <timeout.txt\ndate\nsleep $timeout\ndate\n\nOr using bash-specific syntax:\n#!/bin/bash\ndate\nsleep $(<timeout.txt)\ndate\n\n\nA: Generally this is just a question of getting the information into your script, not so much about the sleep command.\nLets make a simple script 'sleepytime' to get the information from a file (I assume there is just one integer value in that file):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsleep_time_X=$(cat \"X.sleepytime\")\nsleep_time_Y=$(cat \"Y.sleepytime\")\n\necho \"Going to sleep $sleep_time_X second(s)\"\nsleep $sleep_time_X\necho \"Going to sleep $sleep_time_Y second(s)\"\nsleep $sleep_time_Y\n\nthen on the command prompt:\n$ touch Y.sleepytime\n$ touch X.sleepytime\n$ echo \"1\" > X.sleepytime \n$ echo \"2\" > Y.sleepytime\n$ ./sleepytime\nGoing to sleep 1 second(s)\nGoing to sleep 2 second(s)\n\nBut it seems that is not a generally applicable approach. The sleep time might depend on factors outside of our control (e.g network requests, downloads etc). Then it would be preferable to wait until the job is done. This can be accomplished with the wait command. Let's make an additional script that calls our sleep script from above:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Call the sleep script and send it to background (with '&')\n./sleepytime &\n\necho \"Waiting for sleepyhead\"\nwait\n\nThe output is:\nWaiting for sleepyhead\nGoing to sleep 1 second(s)\nGoing to sleep 2 second(s)\n\nNote that the output of the first script comes after \"Waiting for ...\". Maybe that is an option for you...\n", "Q: cloning several hardrives using the dd command I'm developing a software to clone one hard-drive onto several other. I want to clone the content to up to 23 drives at once using dd to clone the partition from the source to the targets using sudo dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/dev/sdc1 bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror and then repeating this command for sdd1, sde1 etc.... \nThe transfer rate, however, is too low for the need of the application. Typically for a good transfer I have around 100 MB/s, but it goes down to 20 MB/s which slows down the process considerably. \nIt just allow me to clone up to 12 disks at once. So I split the cloning process to clone to 12 disks for a first step then the remaining for a second step. But that doesn't improve the speed either.\nI was wondering if there is something I could do between my two steps.\n\nA: You're just being limited by the internal transfer rate of the PCI bus of your computer.  If you want higher speeds, you'll have to stop using a PC and upgrade to server hardware.  For further information see Intel's specifications sheet for the C220 Series Chipset.\nFurthermore, you don't need to develop this software as it already exists: CloneZilla Server. That one however, works using the network, so there you will need an extremely fast server with lots of memory to cache everything and High-speed Ethernet or multiple Gigabit cards to be able to serve all the PC's you want to image simultaneously (not forgetting about a high-speed Ethernet switch.\nIf you still insist on developing your own internal solution, we'll need to have a bit more background information on what you're trying to accomplish as e.g. adding the --sparse parameter to your dd command might speed things up tremendously!  Other options might be partclone or ddrescue or even LVM snapshots but all these depend on your use case.\n\nA: I've always used tee for specifying multiple targets although I don't recommend exceeding the number of available cores. dd is rather intensive regarding it's use of resources. \ncat source.dd | tee >(dd of=/dev/sda) >(dd of=/dev/sdb) >(dd of=/dev/sdc) | dd of=/dev/sdd\nI did this several years ago for mass duplicating some 4GB USB sticks on USB2 ports. It's been a long time so I don't recall the actual sources I used but it might very well have been https://superuser.com/questions/145516/cloning-single-disk-drive-to-multiple-drives-simultaneously which uses virtually identical code.\n", "Q: How to list the packages to be installed by installing a specific package? Pardon this newbie question, but I've previously run into serious issues as I wanted to try other desktop environments other than the default one in Ubuntu, precisely because I didn't know how to completely remove some/all of them and get back to the default settings.\nI think I ran into these issues because I didn't know which packages to remove as I didn't know which packages were installed at the first place. Commands like\nsudo apt-get purge <package name>\n\nstill left some applications installed on my system that were originally installed by the original package.\nI have a couple of questions here\n\n\n*\n\n*how do I list all the packages to be installed by installing a specific package and see which of these packages are already installed on my machine (if any)? \n\n*I imagine purging only the new packages that were installed by this specific package would get things back to the default settings. Is that right? Is there an easy, quick, and effective way to get things back to the default settings (aside from backing up my data)?\n\nA: The basic command to show dependencies is \napt-cache depends <package> \n\nwhich will show you the dependencies (there is even a rdepends option to show the reversed dependencies). \nYou can add this to the @ByteCommander's suggestion to use simulate install to see which packages will be installed in your system: \napt-get install -s ubuntu-desktop\n\n(no need to use sudo in simulated mode!)\nBut to really answer the question, no, it is not possible sometime to go completely back. A classical example is ubuntu-gnome-desktop (Gnome shell) and ubuntu-desktop (Unity). Their dependencies partly overlap --- for example:\n[romano:~] % apt-cache depends ubuntu-desktop | grep seah\n  Depends: seahorse\n[romano:~] % apt-cache depends ubuntu-gnome-desktop | grep seah\n  Depends: seahorse\n\n...and the overlapping packages may have different configuration defaults. \nYou can approximate the thing you want by purging all the packages and reinstalling them --- but it can be really dangerous, because the intermediate step can be a non-functional  system. \nEven outside of the packages, sometime the DEs make changes in your home directory that can affect other DEs (and files in your home are not restored even using purge and reinstall). So if you want to check another DE, do that with a fresh new user. \nMy personal experience is that the \"insulation\" of the various desktop environments is not perfect at all; Unity and Gnome shell are the worst offenders (probably because they share a lot), with other it can be better --- I do not know. \n", "Q: Laptop Content Wiped I am kinda desperate and any help will be appreciated.\nI am running Ubuntu 14.04 on a Lenovo T530i, and my HDD was almost full.\nI planned to buy an external HDD this week end and transfer some data, but then as I was working I got a notification from VMWare that the host OS had 3 gb free only and that it will shutdown, so I switched off my VMWare player and to find out that my whole computer has been wiped out, can't find a single data anywhere.\nIs there a way to retrieve my data as this is really a big loss for me.\nRegards,\nlsblk command:\ndavwise@davwise-ThinkPad-T530:~$ lsblk\n\nNAME                         MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda                            8:0    0 465,8G  0 disk \n├─sda1                         8:1    0   243M  0 part /boot \n├─sda2                         8:2    0     1K  0 part \n└─sda5                         8:5    0 465,5G  0 part \n  ├─ubuntu--vg-root (dm-0)   252:0    0 457,8G  0 lvm  /\n  └─ubuntu--vg-swap_1 (dm-1) 252:1    0   7,7G  0 lvm  [SWAP]\nsr0                           11:0    1  1024M  0 rom  \n\nmount command:\ndavwise@davwise-ThinkPad-T530:~$ mount\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nnone on /sys/fs/cgroup type tmpfs (rw)\nnone on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw)\nudev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,mode=0755)\ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=0620)\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,size=10%,mode=0755)\nnone on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=5242880)\nnone on /run/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)\nnone on /run/user type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=104857600,mode=0755)\nnone on /sys/fs/pstore type pstore (rw)\n/dev/sda1 on /boot type ext2 (rw)\nrpc_pipefs on /run/rpc_pipefs type rpc_pipefs (rw)\nsystemd on /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd type cgroup (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,none,name=systemd)\nvmware-vmblock on /run/vmblock-fuse type fuse.vmware-vmblock (rw,nosuid,nodev,default_permissions,allow_other)\ngvfsd-fuse on /run/user/1000/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=davwise)\n\ncat /etc/fstab command:\ndavwise@davwise-ThinkPad-T530:~$ cat /etc/fstab\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

I have 14.04 LTS installed and it used to work just fine. Since recently however, whenever I want to open an application, Dash doesn't show the application but just some files and irrelevant stuff.\n\nA: It sounds like you opened the dash by hitting Super. However, this opens the home page of the dash which provides usually both files and applications as s search result.  \nYou have to use the Applications lens to search for your programs. You can get there by opening the dash (hit Super or click on the Ubuntu symbol at the top of the launcher bar on the left side of your screen) and then clicking on the A symbol at the bottom of the dash.\nAlternatively, you can use the keyboard to navigate between the lenses: Ctrl+Tab to go right, Ctrl+Shift+Tab to go left.\nYou can also directly enter the dash's application lens by right-clicking on the Ubuntu icon at the top of the launcher and selecting \"Applications\" in the context menu or by hitting Super+A instead of Super only.\nI hope this is what you looked for.

I have all devices keyboard, mouse, connected to my old computer cabinate, running ubuntu. I have only VGA & USB support on my old pc. \n\nA: Most laptop screens (the ones built into the laptop lid) have a proprietary connector to the motherboard and aren't directly compatible with VGA (or even DVI) -- in essence, the electronics that would normally be in the monitor, to translate VGA or DVI input to the actual screen addressing (and brightness/color information) for pixel control are incorporated on the laptop's motherboard, to drive the display panel directly.\nIn order to use the display with another computer, you'd have to have compatible drive electronics from a monitor and a suitable adapter to connect to the laptop's display panel, and you'd have to partially disassemble the laptop to gain access to the ribbon cable that feeds the screen.  This is far from practical, with used XGA flat panel monitors available on eBay for under $50 shipped.\nThe closest you can come to what you want, in practice, would be to run a graphics terminal (Citrix or similar) on the laptop and use it to log into the headless desktop machine.\n\nA: If you old PC is connected to network, do some form of remote login from your laptop to your other PC machine (ssh -X or vnc, etc). If it is not connected to network, but has network support, cross link the two with an Ethernet cable.\n", "Q: What do the numbers mean in output of history?

When it reaches 1000 entries, it can't store more. So if you have 1500 commands, it will display the most recent 1000 (500 to 1500).\nYou can also use the command !N (where N is the number) to run that command again.\nThis is an output of my recent history:\n336  cp monitors.tim monitors.xml\n337  cd .config/\n338  cp monitors.tim monitors.xml\n339  xrandr\n340  sudo nvidia-settings\n341  cd .config/\n342  cp monitors.xml monitors.tim\n343  gedit monitors.xml \n344  cd .config/\n345  gedit monitors.xml\n\nTo rerun the 337th  command, I just do !337. My new history:\n336  cp monitors.tim monitors.xml\n337  cd .config/\n338  cp monitors.tim monitors.xml\n339  xrandr\n340  sudo nvidia-settings\n341  cd .config/\n342  cp monitors.xml monitors.tim\n343  gedit monitors.xml \n344  cd .config/\n345  gedit monitors.xml\n346  cd .config/\n\n\n*It should work that way.\n\n*History isn't designed to be perfectly in order - just remember everything.

It prints first job ok, but when I send another job it behaves as if it is disconnected, until I reboot or unplug and re-plug the usb cable. After that it also prints only one job (either the one I sent previously if I release it, or a new one if I delete old one from the queue).\nIt is interesting that replugging USB cable only works if done at the end where it is connected to the printer. The cable is extension USB cable which on the other end connects to the shorter cable, which goes to printer. If I disconnect end reconnect extension cable from the smaller cable, or smaller cable from the printer, it doesn't work. It only works at the machine's end, but this behavior seems too consistent and specific to be caused by the faulty cable.\nExtension cable is Delock 82446 Cable USB 2.0 Extension, active 10m.\nHere's my cupsd.conf file:\nLogLevel warn\nMaxLogSize 1m\n# Allow remote access\nPort 631\nListen /var/run/cups/cups.sock\nBrowsing On\nBrowseLocalProtocols dnssd\nDefaultAuthType Basic\nWebInterface Yes\n<Location />\n  # Allow remote administration...\n  Order allow,deny\n  Allow all\n</Location>\n<Location /admin>\n  # Allow remote administration...\n  Order allow,deny\n  Allow all\n</Location>\n<Location /admin/conf>\n  AuthType Default\n  Require user @SYSTEM\n  # Allow remote access to the configuration files...\n  Order allow,deny\n  Allow all\n</Location>\n<Policy default>\n  JobPrivateAccess default\n  JobPrivateValues default\n  SubscriptionPrivateAccess default\n  SubscriptionPrivateValues default\n  <Limit Create-Job Print-Job Print-URI Validate-Job>\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit Send-Document Send-URI Hold-Job Release-Job Restart-Job Purge-Jobs Set-Job-Attributes Create-Job-Subscription Renew-Subscription Cancel-Subscription Get-Notifications Reprocess-Job Cancel-Current-Job Suspend-Current-Job Resume-Job Cancel-My-Jobs Close-Job CUPS-Move-Job CUPS-Get-Document>\n    Require user @OWNER @SYSTEM\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit CUPS-Add-Modify-Printer CUPS-Delete-Printer CUPS-Add-Modify-Class CUPS-Delete-Class CUPS-Set-Default CUPS-Get-Devices>\n    AuthType Default\n    Require user @SYSTEM\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit Pause-Printer Resume-Printer Enable-Printer Disable-Printer Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job Hold-New-Jobs Release-Held-New-Jobs Deactivate-Printer Activate-Printer Restart-Printer Shutdown-Printer Startup-Printer Promote-Job Schedule-Job-After Cancel-Jobs CUPS-Accept-Jobs CUPS-Reject-Jobs>\n    AuthType Default\n    Require user @SYSTEM\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit Cancel-Job CUPS-Authenticate-Job>\n    Require user @OWNER @SYSTEM\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit All>\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n</Policy>\n<Policy authenticated>\n  JobPrivateAccess default\n  JobPrivateValues default\n  SubscriptionPrivateAccess default\n  SubscriptionPrivateValues default\n  <Limit Create-Job Print-Job Print-URI Validate-Job>\n    AuthType Default\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit Send-Document Send-URI Hold-Job Release-Job Restart-Job Purge-Jobs Set-Job-Attributes Create-Job-Subscription Renew-Subscription Cancel-Subscription Get-Notifications Reprocess-Job Cancel-Current-Job Suspend-Current-Job Resume-Job Cancel-My-Jobs Close-Job CUPS-Move-Job CUPS-Get-Document>\n    AuthType Default\n    Require user @OWNER @SYSTEM\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit CUPS-Add-Modify-Printer CUPS-Delete-Printer CUPS-Add-Modify-Class CUPS-Delete-Class CUPS-Set-Default>\n    AuthType Default\n    Require user @SYSTEM\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit Pause-Printer Resume-Printer Enable-Printer Disable-Printer Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job Hold-New-Jobs Release-Held-New-Jobs Deactivate-Printer Activate-Printer Restart-Printer Shutdown-Printer Startup-Printer Promote-Job Schedule-Job-After Cancel-Jobs CUPS-Accept-Jobs CUPS-Reject-Jobs>\n    AuthType Default\n    Require user @SYSTEM\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit Cancel-Job CUPS-Authenticate-Job>\n    AuthType Default\n    Require user @OWNER @SYSTEM\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n  <Limit All>\n    Order deny,allow\n  </Limit>\n</Policy>\nMaxJobs 50\n\nHere's my printers.conf file:\n# Printer configuration file for CUPS v1.7.2\n# Written by cupsd\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE WHEN CUPSD IS RUNNING\n<Printer ThPhyPrint>\nUUID urn:uuid:9674b29c-6fbe-33f6-7dd6-8e4d0a1baca2\nInfo \nLocation \nMakeModel HP LaserJet 600 M601 M602 M603 Postscript (recommended)\nDeviceURI hp:/usb/HP_LaserJet_600_M602?serial=CNBVD26086\nPPDTimeStamp *\nState Idle\nStateTime 1424099214\nType 8425684\nAccepting Yes\nShared Yes\nColorManaged Yes\nJobSheets none none\nQuotaPeriod 0\nPageLimit 0\nKLimit 0\nOpPolicy default\nErrorPolicy retry-job\n</Printer>\n\nAlso, when opening print dialog box, Evince (PDF viewer I use) sometimes says \"Authentication is required to get attributes of printer print\" and requires username and password once or twice, but behavior seems independent of whether I enter username and password or simply press cancel button.\n\nA: It turned out that motherboard is probably too old (Asus P4P800) and isn't giving enough power to the cable.

How do I run it? I've tried to click or double click it, which opened another window, but did nothing else. All I want it to do right now, is crunch BOINC work units.\n\nA: First of all: To use boinc, I'd recommend installing it through the software repositories, not from a script. (Simply search for boinc in the Ubuntu Software Centre. You can get boinc manager there, too).\nThere are many advantages in using the software sources instead of downloaded scripts. It's more secure and you'll get automatic updates through the update manager, for instance.\nI never used this script and don't know if it's meant to open any windows or just print to the console its run in. To run it and see what's printed, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T or search Terminal in the Dash). You'll need the path the script is located in. Let's say its /home/fossaw/Downloads. You'd type /home/fossaw/Downloads/boinc_7.4.42_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.sh in the terminal and hit enter, which runs the script. \nIf something is printed to the terminal that sound like there is a permission problem, run sudo /home/fossaw/Downloads/boinc_7.4.42_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.sh. It will ask you for your password and hence run the script with root privileges.\n\nA: Go to the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T). \nType sudo apt-get install boinc-client boinc-manager\nPress Y. \nLet it install. \nNow press the Super key. Search Boinc. \nSource: http://www.overclock.net/t/1449225/guide-installing-boinc-on-ubuntu-from-the-terminal\n\nA: BOINC is in the Ubuntu repositories.

Restrictive file permission is a feature that allows us to have a secure and stable system.\nIn case you really have to and you know what you are doing you will need to be logged in to an administrator account where you can always obtain \"root\" permissions to access anything on your computer.\nThe command sudo preceding commands in a terminal will temporarily give you root permissions to perform administrative tasks, including creating and deleting directories anywhere.

That script probably got updated when you installed the 9.4 server. psql --version shows the version of a command.

I have a desktop machine (Dell T5600) with an Nvidia graphics card (Quadro 2000), and two monitors (Dell 24\"), and I'm running xubuntu 14.04. If I switch off a monitor connected with DisplayPort, xubuntu detects the monitor being removed, and rearranges my desktop. On switching it back on, I have to reconfigure my desktop setup (extented desktop on two monitors). If I switch off a monitor connected to DVI, this does not happen, and when I switch it back on, everything is at it was.\nHow can I make xubuntu ignore the monitor being turned off, and keep everything the way it was when I turn it back on?\n\nA: Not really the most elegant solution, but I managed to solve my immediate problem by connecting the monitor via a DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter. When using this adapter, it seems the computer can't tell whether the monitor is on or off, and thus it doesn't reconfigure anything when I turn off the monitor.\nI'd still like to know how to solve this problem in software, though.\n", "Q: RaspberryPi Snappy Ubuntu.

Please could somebody explain how and when BUG fixes are updated.  \nI have automatic updating enabled for everything except \"Pre-released Updates (Trusty Proposed).  I see that many of the bugs that are bothering me seem to be fixed according to the bug-tracking system, but they are not coming through as updates.\nTo make this more concrete, I note that PCManFM fails to open a terminal in a folder if that folder name contains spaces. I see that this bug in PCManFM 1.2.0 was fixed in lxsession:\nBug #1314931 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxsession/+bug/1314931\nNow I explicitly updated my version of PCManFM to 1.2.3 to get rid of another bug causing hidden files to always be displayed.  Despite the higher version number I still cannot open a terminal in a folder whose name contains spaces.\nAlso I wonder why I did not get the up-to-date version of PCManFM automatically.  Synaptic did not show it to be available.\nIs there something different that I should be doing to get bug fixes more rapidly.  Note that I do not want to chaga later version of Lubuntu.  I am using 14.04 because it is LTS and I want STABILITY, so I am not forever re-installing and fixing software.\n\nA: When an Ubuntu release is made, the versions of packages/software in that release remain constant. In other words, applications aren't updated just because there's a new version available. The only times there is an update made is when there's a regression from the previous version or when there's a critical vulnerability (some packages have exceptions, like tzdata, which contains the timezone information).\nPart of an LTS release is that it's stable. By changing package/application version, you're making the system less stable, as that configuration won't have been tested.\nIn the bug you referenced, note that the fix was in the lxsession package, and bug fixes are always made in the development version of Ubuntu (which was Utopic at that time). If you want it to be in Trusty, someone has to make the case for a Stable Release Update. See the wiki page for the guidelines and the process.\n\nA: Typically, only fixes to critical bugs and security vulnerabilities are pushed down to all users. The exact definition of a \"critical bug\" is subject to interpretation, but in general, these would need to be significant problems that affect a large number of users, cause data loss or corruption, or allow someone to exploit your system.\nAccording to the latest package info I can pull from rmadison, if you have a version of Lubuntu that does not include this bug fix (ie an older version of lxsession than 0.4.9.2+git20140410-0ubuntu2), and you say your packages are up to date, you must be running Lubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\n\n*\n\n*(I'm talking about lxsession because the bug you reference is actually an lxsession bug, not one in  PCManFM itself).\n\n\nIn general, if you want the newest possible software, you should upgrade your system for every new release. Today, this would mean Utopic (14.10), but in two months, Vivid (15.04) will be released. New versions of packages are tested for stability in the development branch, which is why new versions of Ubuntu include newer, updated software.\n\n\n*\n\n*Utopic has in its suite a newer lxsession package than trusty, which includes a fix to this bug.\n\n*I would not recommend forcing an update to lxsession without updated versions of the rest of LXDE, since these LXDE core packages interact heavily with each other, and forcing an update to one without updating the others could introduce all sorts of unusual behavior on your system (and normal Ubuntu support channels would not be able to help fix this).\n\n\nThe point of LTS release is that it stays stable long-term. The trade off you get for stability means that you will not get the latest packages - only patches on that old version of software or updates that have been rigorously tested through the stable release update process.\nIf you want to nominate this package to be released to all users, you could request a Stable Release Update, which would need to be tested in trusty before it would actually go out to users.\nIn general, Ubuntu's packaging philosophy is intended to prevent new bugs from being introduced while patching old ones. This bugfix - which would patch a relatively minor issue likely affecting a limited number of users - could introduce new bugs that affect other users' existing workflow, no matter how minor a patch it might seem. This is something that has never worked in trusty, so it's at a lower priority than regressions, other bugs that break existing user workflows.\nI hope this answers your broad question. I had often wondered this myself when I started using Ubuntu.\n", "Q: how to extend root (/) partition by freeing ext4 partition?

I couldn't find anything online (the terms are too broad), and I didn't find any documentation about this.\nBTW, I know I can probably just set the LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE variable beforehand in .bashrc, but I would like to know this because of plans for other programs as well (such as run with options and things like that).\n\nA: The alias you have tried alias googleearth='LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 googleearth' should work, maybe you did this:\nalias googleearth='LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 googleearth' ; googleearth\n\nor you used the alias in a script or in a fuction. Nothing of this works.\nIf it still doesn't work for you, try creating a function instead of an alias.

I need to use tar in a pipeline inside a shell script to archive and compress some files.\nAfter having read the manpage for tar I was able to make tar output to stdout by running it along with the -O argument, but I wasn't able to find out how to make it input from stdin. Since many commands read from stdin if no other input it's specified, I tried:\npv ~/foo | tar c -O ~/foo.tar\n\nbut that didn't work:\ntar: Cowardly refusing to create an empty archive\n\nTry 'tar --help' or 'tar --usage' for more information.\n\nHow can I make tar read input from stdin?\n\nA: Using -O with c is ignored, since no files are extracted. You'll get the same result either way:\n$ tar c -O foo | tar t\nfoo\n$ tar c foo | tar t  \nfoo\n\nWhich is why I find your error surprising, since tar is no coward if you specify a path.\ntar cannot read in file data from stdin for creating an archive, since then tar will have no way of knowing what a file is - where one begins or ends, what its path and metadata is.\n\nA: This Python script from my Unix.StackExchange answer appends stdin to a tar file, giving it an arbitrary name, using Python's tarfile library.

(I would like to post it, but don't have enough rep.)\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: You might not be able to because of how many releases are in between, however, you need to install \n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install ubuntu-release-upgrader-core\n\nOnce that's installed, I suggest you install tmux as well, since it's easyer to work with than screen\n sudo apt-get install tmux\n\nNow, you can start a tmux session by just typing in tmux . \nNote to self, if you have custom network setup ( bonds and bridges) be advised that the way those are written changes in between distros. I advise you rever that to a dumb and simple 1 interface layout temporary out of fear of locking you out after upgrades.

There must have been some settings that did not take after the configuration, however the issue seems to be resolved. Thank you for your comments!\n\nA: First and foremost with issues like this is to re-boot first, then ask questions if the issue persists.\nA significant indicator in this case was the Tx and Rx packet count being 0 in the ifconfig listing.\nInvestigation at the packet level can be informative in these cases. Use tcpdump (or wireshark, if you prefer) to observe packet traffic while you try to ping other things. Are there outgoing packets, but no return packets? No packets at all? ... Run this command in one terminal:\nsudo tcpdump -n -tttt -i eth0\n\nWhile trying to ping the gateway (the closest external point) in another terminal:\nping 128.159.180.254\n\nAnd observe any output on the tcpdump terminal.\nOn a server, with no gui, one can make other terminals to work with. Depress and hold the \"ALT\" key then depress the \"F2\" key and you will have a new terminal. Depress and hold the \"ALT\" key and then depress the \"F1\" key and you will go back to your original terminal.

It looks like ti's working fine, but after 1/2 minutes the connection goes down without any sign. The wireless connection remains connected but I cannot navigate the web, so I have to start it again manually.\nThis occur when I stay 3/4 meters from the router. When I stay in front of the router I don't have any problem of connection and everything work fine.\nHow can I increase the reliability of my connection when I move away from the router?\n\nA: Since it's working based on where you stand, a couple of things to try out..\n\n\n*\n\n*wifi doesn't pass metal, make sure the router is not obstructed by\nwire mesh, home electronics, maybe walls.\n\n*if your router has antennas, please put your laptop in the non working position, and play with the antennas, and see the signal\nstrength\n\n*Try different bands in the router, or try 5Ghz spectrum if is supported. 2.4Ghz tends to get busy in apartment buildings.\n\n*Check if you don't have conflicting equipment running, such as bluetooth ( other wifi router perhaps in the cable modem, cellphone, that might overlap your wifi)\n\n*If the router is old or weak, it might be the case that if you open too many connections it puts the router under too much load. Check your browsing habits.\n\n*Make sure you run a wpa2 encrypted channel and you don't have rogue users stressing your router..  \n\n\nA: Some time wireless channel could also be a problem. Please change your wireless channel and check the reported issue\nSet your wireless channel in the router to 11 and then save the router configuration and reboot it.\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 channel 11\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Help with restoring windows 7 boot from ubuntu grub I just sold my old laptop on ebay and had Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 installed on separate partitions on the same hd.

The issue is only in Netflix.Screen tearing only persists if I'm full screen. Windowed mode works fine. Running movies in VLC is fine and has no tearing. I'm using Google Chrome Version 40.0.2214.111 (64-bit).\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: This issue occurred after updating 14.04.2. To fix tearing in Chrome while watching Netflix full-screen do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install CompizConfig Settings Manager:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager \n\n\n*Open CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\n*Click Composite.\n\n*In Unredirect Match, add & !(class=^Google-chrome) to the end of the line.\nThis prevents Chrome windows from being unriderected, while leaving other fullscreen windows unredirected. Unredirecting fullscreen windows lets fullscreen apps draw directly to the screen, which should result in higher performance. That also means the app drawing has to manage v-sync if it cares about it. Chrome does not do v-sync by itself when there's a compositing window manager. Thus it relies on Compiz to do it. That's why we need to let Compiz redirect Chrome and manage v-sync for it. In order to not hurt other apps' performance, we add an exception to the Unredirect Match rules instead of turning off the feature altogether. Note that !(class=google-chrome) is already there by default but it doesn't work. The current Chrome window class starts with a capital \"G\" whereas the default rule starts with a lowercase \"g\". It may be possible that the window class got changed during a Chrome update at some point between the rule being added to Ubuntu and now. It could also be a regression in Ubuntu that changed the leading \"G\" was changed to \"g\".\n", "Q: how to install Seismic Analysis Code? I am a new Ubuntu user.

So even though I have selected to show the battery status in the menu bar only when charging or in use (in power settings), it is ALWAYS displayed. When it reaches a full charge, the indicator icon will either show just the percentage (usually 99% or 100%), or sometimes a very big number for time (like 22:14) along with the percentage. If I go to the power settings menu, it always says \"Using battery power\", with something like 40 hours remaining. This is all while plugged in and fully charged.\nAre there any fixes less drastic than trying to update BIOS, or is a BIOS update necessary to fix this? The latest BIOS version is 208 according to the ASUS website, but the (very brief) descriptions of the updates don't mention anything about battery issues. If at all possible I'd like to avoid updating BIOS because of the risk involved.\nI've already tried letting the battery drain all the way and then charging to full, with no luck.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I would turn the laptop off and take out the battery and plug it in to see if it thinks it is on battery power that should make work I think.\n\nA: It seem there is a bug in the acpi, this could be corrected with a modded DSDT but i don't know how to make it load in Ubuntu (tried and failed on my N551JM)\nhere is what user Vmonheros write about it:\nThe culprit is here, inside method FBST (called inside _BST)\nStore (Zero, Local0)\n If (^^LPCB.EC0.ACAP ())\n {\n Store (One, Local0)\n }\nSo Local0=1 if the laptop is on power, fine ;)\nIf (Local0)\n{\nIf (CHGS (Zero))  here CHGS =0 id battery is charging\n{\nStore (0x02, Local0)\n}\nElse\n{\nStore (One, Local0) The error is here, if I'm on power and battery is not charging, we must store zero, not one !\n}\n}\nElse\n{\nStore (One, Local0)\n}\nWith this \"small\" correction, everything works well now.\n\nA: More discussion of similar problem here:\nhttps://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-2195607.html\nFor me removing the power supply did not affect the battery state (was still \"discharging\"), however it was detecting the presence of the power cable (as cat /sys/class/power_supply/AC0/online returns 1).\nThe instructions below from aceat64 at link above fixed it:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Unplug the laptop\n  \n*Hold power button until the laptop powers down\n  \n*Plug in the power cord, the connector should stay amber.

I use GNOME 3's screen magnification, but that doesn't seem to affect anything because I can still see the banded titlebars when fully zoomed out.\nIs there anything I can do to get smooth gradients back? Thanks.\n\nA: Which driver are you using? The ATI one from the ubuntu repo, the ATI one from the website, or the open source radeon driver?\n\nA: It appears to be the result of the laptop's screen being of dubious quality, not a software issue :( I've switched to a MacBook Pro (mid-2012) and its screen does not seem to have these issues (from what I can tell).

I'm using i3-wm on my ubuntu laptop. My screen size is 3200x1800. Which is great for something but horrible for other things. (Netflix vs gvim).\nI'd like to change the resolution of one of my work-spaces, or multiple ones. But I have no idea if that is even possible... can I use compton to do this or maybe another program?\n\nA: 1. Assuming you are on Unity\nThe script below should change your resolution, depending on the current viewport in Unity. I tested it on several computers for a while, and it ran without an error. \nI'd suggest however to also test it for a while and see if it runs without a single break; repeated wmctrl commands can sometimes exit \"non-zero\" incidentally. If so, we need to build in a try / except.\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*I tested it on a single-monitor setup. multiple monitors would probably need another way of parsing the output of xrandr.\n\n*In the head of the script, you need to set the desired resolution for each of your viewports, I set it like mentioned in your comment, but you can change it anytime. Use the format: \nresolutions = [[<horizontal>, <vertical], [<horizontal>, <vertical], ......]\n\nlike it shows in the script.\n\n*No need to say that you should use supported resolutions, as in the output of xrandr for your monitor.\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*copy the script below into an empty file, save it as screen_res.py\n\n*Test run it for a while in a terminal window by the command:\npython3 screen_res.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add...\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n# list of resolution per viewport, for each viewport a separate [hor, vert]\n# I pre- entered your viewports. quite some! listing takes more space than the script :)\nresolutions = [\n    [3200, 1800],\n    [3200, 1800],\n    [3200, 1800],\n    [3200, 1800],\n    [3200, 1800],\n    [3200, 1800],\n    [3200, 1800],\n    [1920, 1080],\n    [1920, 1080],\n    [1920, 1080],\n    ]\n\ndef get_xr():\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n\ncheck = get_xr()\nplus = 2 if check[check.index(\"connected\")+1] == \"primary\" else 1\n\nwhile True:\n    # resolution:\n    xr = get_xr()    \n    res = [int(n) for n in xr[xr.index(\"connected\")+plus].split(\"+\")[0].split(\"x\")]\n    # get current viewport\n    vp_data = subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-d\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    dt = [int(n) for n in vp_data[3].split(\"x\")]\n    cols = int(dt[0]/res[0])\n    curr_vpdata = [int(n) for n in vp_data[5].split(\",\")]\n    curr_col = int(curr_vpdata[0]/res[0])+1; curr_row = int(curr_vpdata[1]/res[1])\n    curr_vp = curr_col+curr_row*cols\n    # check and change resolution if needed\n    if res != resolutions[curr_vp-1]:\n        new_res = (\"x\").join([str(n) for n in resolutions[curr_vp-1]])\n        subprocess.call([\"xrandr\", \"-s\", new_res])\n    time.sleep(1)\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*In a loop, the script first checks the screen's current resolution from the command:\nxrandr\n\n\n*Subsequently, the script checks the total desktop size (all viewports) from the command: \nwmctrl -d\n\n\n*Then, from the resolution i.c.w. the total desktop size, it calculates the number of columns, which is equal to the total desktop size, divided by the horizontal resolution. \n\n*Also in the output ofwmctrl -d is the position of the current viewport on the spanning desktop: e.g.: VP: 1680,0.\n\n*With this information we can conclude on which column & row we are, and check if the currently set resolution matches the resolution as we defined it in the list in the head section of the script. \nIf not, the script gives the command to change the resolution with the command:\nxrandr -s <xres>x<yres>\n\n2.

It has been determined already in this question that tar cannot read input from stdin.\nHow else can a dd output be archived directly possibly without using any compression? The purpose of doing everything in a single task is to avoid to write the dd output to the target disk twice (once as a raw file and once as an archive), and to avoid to perform two different tasks, which is a waste of time (since the input file must be read and written and the output read, processed and written again), and can be impossible if the target drive is almost full.\nI'm planning to do multiple backups of drives, partitions and folders, and I'd like to benefit both from the ease of having everything stored into a single file and from the speed of each backup / potential restore task.\n\nA: If you want to dump a whole block device to a file, tar won't be of any use, because it doesn't work with block devices. Instead you'll need to use dd or similar:\ndd if=/dev/sdX of=/path/to/backup bs=16m\n\nEven like this it would be better to use at least a little compression, as long as it doesn't slow down the transfer too much. In short, you need a compression algorithm with a throughput not much lower than that of your slowest storage medium. There are several such compression algorithms. The most notorious are Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer, its derivate L4Z, and Snappy. There's a comparison of various compression algorithms including those three on the L4Z project page:\nName            Ratio  C.speed D.speed\n                        MB/s    MB/s\nLZ4 (r101)      2.084    422    1820\nLZO 2.06        2.106    414     600\nQuickLZ 1.5.1b6 2.237    373     420\nSnappy 1.1.0    2.091    323    1070\nLZF             2.077    270     570\nzlib 1.2.8 -1   2.730     65     280\nLZ4 HC (r101)   2.720     25    2080\nzlib 1.2.8 -6   3.099     21     300\n\nFor the sake of this answer, I'll choose an example with LZO, because it's readily available in Canonical's repositories in the form of lzop, but ultimately all those stream compressors have front-ends that read from standard input and write to standard output.\ndd if=/dev/sdX bs=16m | lzop > /path/to/backup.lzo\n\nIf you want to work on the same machine during backup, you may want to use ionice and/or nice/schedtool:\nionice -c 3 dd if=/dev/sdX bs=16m | ionice -c 3 schedtool -B -n 10 -e lzop > /path/to/backup.lzo\n\n", "Q: VirtualBox - how to increase video memory? I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on VirtualBox, including the guest additions. \nHowever, the display is really slow. Looking at the display settings I can see that the video memory is only 12MB but I can't move the slider to increase it. The checkboxes for extended features are greyed-out too. See screenshot.\n.\nHow do I increase the amount of memory?\nTIA\n\nA: Virtual Box supports up to 256 MB of video RAM. This can not be set using the slider of the Virtual Box Manager.\nTo make full use of all supported memory we can issue the following command in a terminal:\nVBoxManage modifyvm \"Name of VM\" --vram 256\n\nBefore we change settings such as the video RAM a pre-existing virtual machine has to be shut down.\nNote that for 3D video hardware acceleration from the guest addition's video driver the physical RAM of the host graphics card will be passed through. The video RAM settings of the virtual machine will not affect this.\n\nA: Set Monitor Count to 8 and you will have the ability to increase the video memory at 256 MB.\n\nA: *\n\n*Shutdown your VM\n\n*From an elevated command prompt:\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\VBoxManage.exe\" modifyvm \"Ubuntu\" --vram 256\n\nReplace Ubuntu with the name of your VM.\nIf your installation path for Virtualbox is different, replace C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\ with the directory you installed it to.\nVerify it works.\nAnd of course from the terminal from the VM Ubuntu:\n\n\n*sudo apt-get install dkms & sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms\n\n*Reboot your VM\n\n\nA: You need to shut down the virtual OS before you can edit settings.\n\nA: As Marvin stated, you need to shutdown the VM before you change things. You also need to sudo apt-get install  virtualbox-guest-dkms in the virtual ubuntu. And be advised that 3d acceleration might not work, and Unity is heavy on 3D. Thus using a less graphic intensive desktop like xfce4 might be a better/faster option. Please enable 2D acceleration at least. It should provide some speedup.\n\nA: In VB v5.1.x, if you enable 3D Acceleration first in the UI, VRAM automatically jumps to 256M. \n\n\nA: *\n\n*Stop the virtual machine and close virtualbox\n\n*Using a text editor like \"Sublime Text\" open YOUMACHINE.vbox.

For example, create a .conf file in ~/.config/upstart (say ~/.config/upstart/stop-brother.conf) containing:\ndescription \"Stop all my brother's processes\"\nstart on desktop-start or desktop-unlock\ntask\n\nexec sudo pkill -STOP -u brother\n\nAnd a converse file (say ~/.config/upstart/start-brother.conf) containing:\ndescription \"Resume all my brother's processes\"\nstart on desktop-end or desktop-lock\ntask\n\nexec sudo pkill -CONT -u brother\n\nYou also need a NOPASSWD entry in sudoers:\nsudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stop-brother <<EOF\n$USER ALL = (ALL) /usr/bin/pkill -STOP -u brother, /usr/bin/pkill -CONT -u brother\nEOF\n\nNow the signals should be sent automatically when you log in, log out, lock or unlock the screen.

Windows was still working, of course.\nNo big deal, I got back home and I prepared to install Ubuntu again.\nBut this time, I made a mistake myself. During the process, the system detected the previous installation of Ubuntu, so this time I didn't use the manual partitioning, but I selected the option to reinstall the OS.\nI thought it would only reinstall Ubuntu, leaving the Windows partition alone, but instead it formatted everything and installed Ubuntu as the only OS. \nAfter barely restrainin myself from throwing the PC out of the window, I created an empty partition and installed Windows in it.\nAfter the installation, the system booted Windows by default (no GRUB screen), which I guess is normal.....I loaded Ubuntu from the BIOS, and I used Boot Repair to solve it.\nIt gave me this error\nso I selected the Advanced Options, I activated the option \"Separate /boot/efi partition\" selecting the sda1 partition, and I launched it.\nNow, when I turn on the PC the GRUB screen appears, showing the options to load Ubuntu or WIndows.\nWhen I choose Ubuntu it works fine, but if I select Windows an error flashes for an instant, saying\nFailed to open \\EFI\\Microsoft\\grubx64.efi - 800000000000000E\nFailed to load image\nFailed to open \\EFI\\Microsoft\\MckManager.efi - 00000000000000000E\nFailed to load image\n\nand it goes back to the GRUB screen.\nI created a Boot Repair log if it can be of any help:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/10290244\nAny ideas to solve this and load Windows again?\nThank you!\nP.S.

But, I want to keep all of my files that was made when i had windows in Ubuntu, use windows application in WINE that are not available for Ubuntu. I do not have a backup drive.\nI currently own a HP Probook 4540s \n - Core i3-3110m\n - 8 GB or RAM\n - 500 GB hard drive.\nThe drive is NTFS, and I am aware to need to format it to at ext3/ext4.\nSo it this able to be accomplish, if so, how?\n\nA: Add a separate partition. It's how I did it when switching from Ubuntu to Mint.\nEssentially you would use gparted (inside the liveCD) and resize your Windows partition to free up disk space. You can then create an additional partition which it formatted in a Windows recognizable format (NTFS is fine). When you restart Windows, you will have an additional drive where you can move your stuff into. It's VERY risky though as anything could go wrong while doing this. Once you've moved all your stuff into the additional partition from Windows, you can then proceed to install Linux on the Windows partition. DO NOT do an entire disk installation of Linux as this will remove the partition with the files in it.\n\nA: I just did this yesterday  on my wifes laptop.  Unfortunately, you need something to back up your data from windows.  An external hard drive, thumbdrive, or burn some cds or dvds.  This is what I did:  boot clonezilla live cd and do a disk to disk clone of your windows drive.  By doing disk to disk vs disk to image, you can mount the drive in linux and copy any files over to linux.  Once your image is made and verified, install ubuntu having it replace windows.  Now you should be able to mount the external drive and copy over anything you need.  The whole process took a few hours, and ubuntu is so much quicker and uses up much less space than a windows install.  You could pick up an external drive pretty cheap, but if you have any from older machines buy an enclosure or ide/sata to usb cable from Amazon.\n", "Q: How to make a SUCCESSFUL persistent Ubuntu live hard disk drive or USB I had the idea a few days back to make a portable hard drive that boots Linux. That way I can keep programs with me. The problem is, I can't install an OS because drivers won't work between computers. I tried this with UbuntuGNOME, and I got ERR2ERR3 when I tried to boot.\nAfter researching online I found that a persistent Ubuntu live USB will work perfectly. The problem is, none of the USBs that I made have actually been persistent. I made one with UbuntuGNOME and Ubuntu Desktop. They boot fine, and I can change settings, install programs, and make files. Then, after shutting down and turning back on, all my changes were reverted.\nAny help with creating a persistent Ubuntu live USB or any suggestions for what I am trying to accomplish would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: A Full install to USB should work on any computer that a persistent install works on as long as no proprietary drivers are installed.\nThe best tool for creating a persistent USB is mkusb.\nIt will build a drive with read only OS partition, casper-rw persistence partition, (not limited to 4GB), and if desired a NTFS data partition accessible to Linux and Windows.\n\nA: I have not tried it's persistence setting, but I use a program called YUMI from pendrivelinux.com. I use it with an 8G thumbdrive and on it I can boot ubuntu 14.04(32 or 64) gnome ubuntu 14.04(32 or 64), puppy linux, clonezilla, and a few other utility OS's. The app, surprisingly works better on a windows machine or with wine, the native app is lacking. Like I said, it does allow creating persistence, but I have not tried it. Anytime I want to save setting(networking, etc), I'll typically boot puppy linux.\n\nA: Bug 1159016 is still a problem on UEFI machines. On the live USB you created, you can edit the grub.cfg file yourself and add the word persistent to the Linux boot line. The persistence on your device should then work on both non-UEFI machines (which use the SYSLINUX boot code) and the new UEFI machines (which use GRUB).\n", "Q: Command is available in …; The command could not be located I have a problem in my terminal.

Hopefully the last command will find nothing to do, and you'll be able to do a clean install with sudo apt-get install libreoffice. \n", "Q: How to find lines matching a pattern and delete them?

I suspect that it has something to do with the \" | xargs rm\" part in the script.\n\nA: First, glen jackman was close: your script is using CR-LF (\\r\\n) line endings. For example, I recreated your script with CRLF line endings manually:\n$ cat foo.sh     \n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Deleting: \" $1\ngrep -lr $1 foo.txt | xargs echo\necho \"Done\"\n$ file foo.sh \nfoo.sh: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable, with CRLF line terminators\n$ sh foo.sh bar\nDeleting:  bar\n: No such file or directory\nDone\n\nChange your line endings to the normal form, by installing dos2unix and using it to convert:\nsudo apt-get install dos2unix\ndos2unix clear_single_cache_object.sh\n\nSecond, since you're giving a shebang, why are you calling your script with sh? Make it executable and run it drectly:\nchmod +x clear_single_cache_object.sh\n./clear_single_cache_object.sh /images/test.jpg\n\nIf you'd done that, you could have caught the problem earlier:\n$ ./foo.sh \nbash: ./foo.sh: bad interpreter: /bin/bash^M: no such file or directory\n\nThird, fix your editor. If you're creating the script on Windows and then copying to your server, use a decent editor like Notepad++ which supports Unix line endings (LF).\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 14.10 on secondary UEFI partition Trying to install latest Ubuntu desktop release 14.10 on a new system with 64-bit Intel X99 motherboard having UEFI firmware. For the installation I am using a USB EFI formatted live USB stick. My system has 2 physical 1TB Winchester hard drives (sda and sdb), where sda contains a bootable and working Windows 8.1 UEFI partitioned installation and sdb has been pre-partitioned for a Ubuntu UEFI installation. When running the Ubuntu installation process, the installer crashes while installing grub2 with the message: \nThe 'grub-efi-amd64-signed' package failed to install into /target/. \nWithout the Grub boot loader, the installed system will not boot.\n\nI have uploaded a detailed boot-repair description of how my hard disks are partitioned at http://paste.ubuntu.com/10300722 for your review as necessary. \nI have created a separate partition on the second hard disk (sdb1) for Ubuntu's boot files to reside in. However, for some reason, even when selecting this partition in the installer when using option \"something else\", the installer fails to properly install the required UEFI boot files.\nMy goal is to boot using the UEFI firmware's boot menu, not grub or the Windows boot menu.\nCan this be accomplished with Ubuntu? \n\nA: Thanks Fabby for your response. Your answer to copy the ubuntu UEFI files to a UEFI partition is correct. However, I was only able to resolve my problem by first disconnecting the Window's hard drive altogether from the system before running the ubuntu system installer. This allowed the installer to correctly copy the grub2 UEFI files into the EFI system partition on the ubuntu hard disk. It seems that the ubuntu installer has bugs that need to be worked out with regard to dual boot configurations that rely on UEFI and Widows 8+. With regard to your comment of disk partition /dev/sdb1 not being a UEFI partition, I assume that I used the wrong term. I should have stated this as being an ESP (EFI System Partion) as stated in the disk partitioning report that I have provided a link to in my original note. The good news is that the system now dual boots properly displaying a grub menu for selecting ubuntu or windows and everything is fine :). Hope this chain helps some other frustrated users out there.\nWith regards,\nDougC\n\nA: What you're trying to do is impossible with your current configuration.\nUEFI is like BIOS, but on a disk.  /dev/sdb1 is not an UEFI partition: it's just an empty VFAT partition.  To keep the analogy with the BIOS: you've bought en EEPROM chip, stuck it on your motherboard and expect it to contain a BIOS.  It does not!  :-(  You need to load the UEFI system files to the drive before you can attempt to try what you want to do... This can only be done if your system supports multiple UEFI partitions: I've never seen any system that can do this, but that doesn't mean it's impossible.\nSo with the current system set-up you have, what you need to do is to put the Ubuntu UEFI system files on the UEFI partition and then you can put the rest of the OS anywhere you want...  (including on /dev/sdb)\nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news...\n", "Q: boot from USB drive Ubuntu or Windows 8 As security I would like only when I have the USB drive plugged in the laptop to be ask if I would like to boot my Ubuntu desktop otherwise to boot my installer Windows 8 . Could anyone let me know if is possible.\nRegards Cosmin\n\nA: You should be able to install Ubuntu on the HDD (partitions for / and swap, maybe also /home or whatever you want to separate), but create a separate /boot partition on the USB drive and also install the GRUB bootloader there. \nYou then should be able to plug in your USB and select it as boot device from your BIOS/UEFI menu. \nBut the other partitions would remain on the HDD and could be accessed from the Windows system (using special tools) or any other live (Ubuntu) system booting from CD/DVD or USB. Drive encryption would be useful then to prevent that kind of unwanted access, although I am not sure whether this would work together with booting from an external media. \nNote that I never tried this kind of installation, so I have no practical experience and might tell you something wrong.\nMake sure you have valid backups of your data before changing anything!\nAnd as always: you operate on your own risk.

One thing I did was going from software raid to a raid card.\nAfter doing this and starting to copy back my backups, I've noticed that my first ~1TB backup takes up ~1.4TB of space on my new array. Since thats a whopping 400GB increase in space used, I'm guessing I've done something wrong.\nMy setup\nI have my OS installed on a separate 32GB SSD. All drives used in the array are WD Red 2TB WD20EFRX.\nMy old setup was on Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop with a 3x2TB RAID-5 array (leaving 4TB available). I was using the software raid function in my motherboards BIOS. I had partitioned and formated the array using the Disk Utility in GNOME. I'm not sure what format I used. It was most likely what was presented as default for me.\nMy new setup is on Ubuntu 14.10 Server. The array is now a 6x2TB RAID-5 array (leaving 10TB available in theory). I'm now using the RocketRaid 2720SGL \"fake hardware\" raid card.\nSetup process\nI installed the driver and WebGUI and then initialised the drives and created the new RAID-5 array through the RocketRaid WebGUI (which I read in reviews was strongly recommended over the cards BIOS function). Being unsure on the more advanced settings, I picked the default sector size of 512B. The build process ran through the night successfully.\nUsing fdisk I then partitioned the array. Due to the size of the disk fdisk warned me that I needed to select the GUID partition table - which I did. I formated the array as ext4 (seemed the recommended choice from my research). For sector size, sector start and sector end I picked the default values presented to me.\nUsing fdisk -l it looks like this right now\nDevice    Start         End     Sectors Size Type\n/dev/sdb1 2048  19534315486 19534313439 9.1T Linux filesystem\n\nI initially looked at picking 4K instead of 512B when building the array. However when I researched the drives I use I found some debate concerning getting 4K sector size to work on them, so I decided against it.\nI had my original array backed up on 3 different external 1TB drives. I had copied ~980GB chunk of directories from the original array to the first external drive (the external drive is formated as ext4). Restoring from this external drive I connected the drive via USB to the server and mounted it to /media/usb. I then used this command to copy the backup from the first external drive to my new array.\nrsync -av /media/usb /media/array/drive-one\n\nThis copied everything on the external drive (should be 980GB). These files are now taking up 1.38TB on my new array.\nSo, could it have anything to do how I configured the sectors? Or perhaps the way I'm copying the files from my backup?\n\nA: 6*2TB RAID5 will give you between 8TB data and 4 TB parity and 10GB data and 2GB parity \nThe former gives you dual disk failure protection whereas the latter is discouraged as it gives you single disk failure protection without any further redundancy.  Also, depending on the UI, you will see the real usage (including parity) or the fake usage (excluding parity), so what you're seeing doesn't look abnormal to me.\nThe ideal RAID5 set-up is 5 disks+1 hot-spare.  The logic behind this being that you're buying all of the disks at the same time, so they will (probably) fail around the same time and if one of the disks fails, the hot spare takes over (that's why it's called \"hot\": it is powered on, but does nothing until one of the other disks fails) giving you time to order a new disk and continuing normal operations instead of \"degraded mode\" operations... \nNow you can use the 6th disk not as a hot spare but as a hot drive giving you more parity, but you can also use it to increase storage and that one means sacrificing dual hard disk failure protection. and that is why it's discouraged...  ;-)\nHave a look at this RAID calculator here and play with the numbers for more information.\nFor more information: Wikipedia RAID explained (read it all, including the history) and a specific article on RAID5\n", "Q: Problems with /etc/rc.local startup command My current setup consists of Ubuntu VPS 14.04 x64 Bit.

This message does not indicate a security problem with Ubuntu and does not interfere with the operation of the system except for introducing this boot delay. As a workaround to avoid this boot delay, users can enable SecureBoot if enabled on their hardware, or if they do not intend to use SecureBoot at all they can uninstall the shim-signed package and then rerun the grub-install command. 1384973\n\n\nA: I got it. I guess my laptop has some kind of hybrid BIOS+UEFI/EFI sistem because it only accepts UEFI/EFI Ubuntu's installation.\nThe cause of the problem was this Shim + SecureBoot bug.

However, the package that had problems was from trusty-updates. So, how does this fallback mechanism work? Moreover, what are the scenarios when this mechanism is triggered?\n\nA: If multiple repositories provide the exact same version of a package, then apt uses the repository that comes first in the sources.list as the first choice and the others for fallback.\nIf use apt-cache policy, you'll get results of the form:\n$ apt-cache policy libdns100\nlibdns100:\n  Installed: 1:9.9.5.dfsg-3ubuntu0.1\n  Candidate: 1:9.9.5.dfsg-3ubuntu0.1\n  Version table:\n *** 1:9.9.5.dfsg-3ubuntu0.1 0\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-security/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1:9.9.5.dfsg-3 0\n        500 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n\nAs you can see, the exact same version of the package is provided by two repositories - even though they are in different channels, they provide the same package and version.\nFrom man apt_preferences:\n   Several instances of the same version of a package may be available\n   when the sources.list(5) file contains references to more than one\n   source.

Since a few months, on one of the desktop Ubuntu 14.04 systems I use, CPU has regularly been going up to 80-100% for no apparent reason. htop would usually attribute responsability to file system processes, such as nemo or ntfs. To get CPU back down I would kill these process, which in some cases would lead to loss of access to the file system and a consequent restart.\nDays ago I noticed that whenever this situation happened another process was always present also using high CPU: mediascanner-service-2.0. Some research lead me to this thread at the Forum that simply advised its removal. So I did.\nThe end result has been unexpectedly positive: not only are the high CPU load episodes gone, the system is altogether much faster. The speed up of the Lens is dramatic: finding an application like Calc now takes 2 seconds at most when previously it took some 20 seconds. Finding a file takes now some 5 seconds, whereas before it took in the order of 30 seconds. Heavy programmes like Eclipse are starting up faster and workspaces are more fluid. There seems to be also an overall reduction in the frequency of disk access.\nWhat is exactly this mediascanner2.0 package? Is it part of Unity 7 or a dependency that gets installed a posteriori? Is it possible to prevent its installation?\nUpdate: following Seth's suggestion it is possible to track this package down to indicator-session:\n$ sudo aptitude why mediascanner2.0\ni   indicator-session         Recommends indicator-applet (>= 0.2) | indicator-renderer\ni A unity8                    Provides   indicator-renderer                            \ni A unity8                    Recommends unity-scope-mediascanner2                     \npi  unity-scope-mediascanner2 Depends    mediascanner2.0                               \n\nApparently, mediascanner2.0 (and the Unity 8 shell) are part of the base 14.04 system. Left to answer is the exact function of this rogue package. \n\nA: mediascanner2.0 is a package used in Unity 8 to discover media and then play it. For example, the Core Music App on Unity 8 uses mediascanner to scan the music directory(or any directory for that matter) and then play back music. Since Ubuntu is moving towards Unity 8, it is included by default in the Ubuntu iso. \nmediascanner is scanning your whole hard drive to discover media, so the first time around, it will slow your computer. Eventually, it should cache its results, and then it will stop being so resource intensive. \nYou have two options to help fix your issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*(Prefered solution)You can explicitly tell mediascanner to not attempt to scan a directory by creating a new fie and titling it .nomedia. Then, when mediascanner reaches this directory, it will not even bother to index it. In theory, you can do this for as many directories on you computer, and mediascanner should stop indexing them.\n\n*You can uninstall it, which in the short term(Until Unity 8 becomes default) will stop this from occurring, but you run the risk to running into dependency issues. Note: If you are doing Ubuntu SDK development, mediascanner is a dependency.\n\n\nHope this helped :)\nSource\n", "Q: Move file to another user's home directory (without sudo) I have a couple of files that I want to move to another's user home directory. I don't have permissions to write to that user's home directory, but I know his password.\nI know how to copy the file using scp (see here). However, if I want to move the file, copying and then removing the original file is inefficient. Is there a way to move the file, without using sudo (I don't know the root's password)?\n\nA: You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make your home directory world-readable and writeable.\n\n*Login into his account.\n\n*Move your files to his directory.\n\n*Change ownership of said files.\n\n*Logout of his account.\n\n*Revert permissions of your home directory.\n\n\nDetailed Step-by-Step Guide\nAssume you're becko and you want to move the files to bob's home directory. Thus the paths for your homes are as follows (by default):\nbecko: /home/becko/\nbob: /home/bob/\n\nNow let's say the paths of the files you want to move are as follows:\n/home/becko/file_01\n/home/becko/file_02\n/home/becko/file_03\n\nNow, with this introduction, we can start.\nNOTE: This example assumes all relevant files are one level below your home directory.\nStep One: Make your home directory world-readable and writeable\nWhile logged in as yourself, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T).\nGo to your home directory and make it world-readable:\n$ cd ~\n$ chmod 0777 .\n\nStep Two: Login into his Account\nThen, using the example provided above:\n$ su - bob\n\nYou'll be prompted with his password.\nStep Three: Move your files to his directory\nAfter you login, you should see the following prompt (or something close to it):\nbob@hellsdesk:~$ \n\nNow you are in bob's home directory. Now, time to move your stuff over.\nThe following commands should do it:\n$ mv /home/becko/file_01 .\n$ mv /home/becko/file_02 .\n$ mv /home/becko/file_03 .\n\nStep Four: Change Ownership of Files:\nNOTE: For me, the ownership changed to bob automatically, but might as well be safe than sorry. :)\nCommands:\n$ chown bob:bob file_01\n$ chown bob:bob file_02\n$ chown bob:bob file_03\n\nStep Five: Logout of His Account\nThis one's easy. Type:\n$ logout\n\nYour prompt should then change back to something like:\nbecko@hellsdesk:~$\n\nStep Six: Revert your home directory permissions.\nBy default, the permissions are 0755. So, we'll do that:\n$ chmod 0755 .\n\nClose the terminal and you're done!\n\nA: You don't need the root's password for sudo, you need your password; in fact, there is no root password in a normal Ubuntu installation.\nBut, if you can't, or don't want to use sudo, you could make sure the file and it's directory have read/write (modify) permissions for everyone, then log in as the other person, and move it normally.  Or, make a directory in the other person's home directory, and set it to writable so you can move things there as yourself.\nThis is basic linux behavior.\n\nA: Actually we may need some more information. For example, you don't need to know the root password to use sudo. If your user is in sudo group you can use sudo with your user's regular password. So, If this is the case:\nsudo mv file_to_move /home/desired_user\n\nIf you can't use sudo you can write a simple bash script to copy the file with scp and after that delete it. But, if you have rsync installed:\nrsync -avz --remove-source-files -e ssh file_to_move desired_user@127.0.0.1:/home/desired_user\n\nworks also.\n", "Q: Black Screen after password Unity not working Hello this is my first question on here, but after looking around I cant seem to find a fix for my problem. \nSo here it is, Everytime I start up my PC I get the usual \"enter Passcode\" Which I do.

Which one is right?\n\nA: I believe you want: Wpa 1/2 (passphrase) .\n\nA: I've had learning curves with WICD in the past along these lines too... My solution was that the router was emitting wpa1/wpa2 but not doing the greatest job of it (for WICD to connect to). I then set the router to wpa2 (passphrase) only (pretty much all tech from the last 5-8 years runs wpa2 in my experience so it doesn't alienate any of my other hardware) and then matched that with wicd...\nNo problems from there on in...\nP.S. your router may have ddifferent options (Labels) to mine but investigate it further and find the matching pair.\nGood Luck\n\nA: WPA2 Personal corresponds to WPA 1/2 in Wicd.  It is by far the most common in home routers.  WPA2 uses AES so no surprise there.  WPS is just a newer type of setup between compatible routers and wireless cards that basically exchanges very strong passwords automatically for you.  It doesn't matter if you don't have this, just make sure you choose a good password.  You may also want to set your router to only accept connections from known devices.\nUsually your router will have a \"passphrase\" or password configured, so you would want WPA 1/2 (passphrase).  The passphrase for WPA does not have to be printable characters so in the case that your have a non-printable password you would use WPA 1/2 hex and enter a string of unintelligible numbers and a-f letters.\nThe other WPA2 options are for large corporate type networks, so you might need those at work or possibly at school.\nIn Wicd you have to select the encryption type and enter the password, then save, before you attempt to connect.  If you were correct then you get logged in and the authentication details should be remembered for the future.  Sometimes it takes two or three attempts.\n", "Q: shutdown from gnome menu doesn't ask password I want to prevent my roommates to shutdown my computer without needing my password from the gnome menu at the top. i would like to keed dbus permissions since i am using that commands with alias. everybody is asking to how not to require a password but there is little and obsolete knowledge about this issue on the internet. thank you in advance\ni am using 14.04\n\nA: You can do this in dconf editor.

Gedit creates them in case you make a mistake when editing a file, so you can restore it afterwards. So if you're sure that you don't want to revert those changes, you can safely delete those files ending in \"~\".\nThis behavior can be changed if you want to. For this, open Gedit, go to Edit → Preferences → Editor and toggle the option  \"Create a backup copy of files before saving.\"\n\nA: Gedit has an option under the Editor tab in the preferences which will create a backup copy of a file before saving which is checked by default in Ubuntu and can be disabled to remove this functionality. Also it is generally safe to delete these files as they are only backups of the originals, obviously the only un-safe time to delete them would be if you lost the original but assuming you still have them then it is safe.\n", "Q: Folder links break after reboot I just installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 onto a drive with existing partitions.

While it was mounted, you could create a working link, but after restarting, it isn't mounted until you click on it again; then, the link would work.\nThe solution is to explicitly mount the partition.  This connects it to the filesystem at some directory of your choosing.  So, there are several steps required, but none of them are very complicated, although slightly problematic because of permissions, especially when the partition is formatted as NTFS, which seems to be the case with yours.\nFor learning, you can use the mount command in a terminal, and the umount command to unmount.  But in the end, you will want to make a permanent entry in /etc/fstab, although there is a method to experiment there, too, using a form of the mount command to tell it to mount everything in the file, and see if you get errors.  If things are not to your liking, you would issue the umount command to unmount the new partition, edit the file, then try again.\nThis is probably not clear, but I'll explain later.\nOne problem is that I don't have any NTFS partitions, so I can't really tell you exactly what options to use to get the right permissions, which is why I tried not to post an answer, but commented instead.\nNow, notice that the mount command gave you a line like this:\n/dev/sda5 on /media/emily/ Gaming type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\n\nI don't know why there is a space before \"Gaming\", though.  That looks like an error, but it doesn't matter, as we will create a directory to use.\nA...  First of all, you need to create an empty directory to use for mounting, because it needs to exist. So, to keep from getting too confused with the automatic mountpoint, create it under the directory /mnt, like so:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/gaming\nsudo chown emily:emily /mnt/gaming\n\nI'm assuming emily is your username; if not, substitute whatever it is.\nB...  Next step is to find a better identifier for the partition. You could use \"/dev/sda5\", but that's not the most reliable label, because it can change.  I personally use the disk label, for clarity, but most people seem to want to use the UUID, which is assigned at format time, and is always unique.  To find this ID, you would enter sudo blkid and look for the line starting with \"/dev/sda5\".  There should be a section with something like UUID=\"nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\", some combination of numbers and digits.  You will copy that into the fstab file (highlight the big number, copy using shift-ctrl-C, then paste it into the file (later, though).\nC... Next, open /etc/fstab for editing; I'll assume you will use gedit, but any basic editor is OK.  Enter gksu gedit /etc/fstab (because the file is owned by root).  Add a line to the end of the file:\nUUID=nnnnnnnnnnnnnn /mnt/gaming ntfs-3g defaults,user_xattr 0 0\n\nD... Save, but don't close the file.  Go to a terminal, and type mount -a.  This will mount everything in /etc/fstab, and hopefully will not give any errors. If you get any errors for the line you added, and don't understand the reason, then add a pound sign (#) to the beginning of the line to disable it, save, close, and post back for help.\nIf it works OK, try finding the directory /mnt/gaming, and see if the partition is accessible.  Try creating a link to that directory, and see if it works the way you want.\nI hope this will help.  If not, perhaps someone else can do better, as I need to leave for now.\nEDIT\nI tried to add bullets and it messed up some formatting, which I didn't notice because I had to leave in a hurry.  So, 2 lines got unseparated into one, and the result was:\n sudo mkdir /mnt/gaming sudo chown emily:emily /mnt/gaming\n\nI feel bad about this; what it did was to make more directories than the one - it created /mnt/gaming, sudo, chown, and emily:emily, and then tried again to create /mnt/gaming, resulting in the error message.  No real harm done except for some strange directories (owned by root because of sudo).  All of them except /mnt/gaming are in whatever directory you were in when you issued the command (maybe your home directory, /home/emily).  I will help you delete them when you're ready.  I'm really sorry about that; I didn't initially want to answer because I didn't have enough time, and perhaps it was a mistake to try. \nEdit 2\nWhen you typed /mnt/gaming, The system tried to run a file named \"gaming\" in the \"/mnt\" directory.  You need to do cd /mnt/gaming and then ls to see the files, or use Nautilus to find that directory under the filesystem root directory.\nI don't know what the gedit error was, but it may not have been related to anything.  When you typed sudo mount -a, it should do nothing if it works; this is the linux way.  If there's an error, it tells you; otherwise it just quietly does what you expect.  So, assuming the partition shows up, it worked.\nNote\nI will keep checking back until solved\n", "Q: Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235 throughput I have an Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6235 [8086:088e] (rev 24) that is connected at 300mbit/s according to iwconfig.

When I open Sublime Text from the terminal, I have type in \n$ sublime_text <filename>\n\nIs there any way I can change it so I can say something like:\n$ subl <filename>\n\n\nA: Avinash is right. Aliases are a way for you to customize the commands by giving them aliases (nicknames). You can use them to remember hard commands or make short names to long commands you just hate to type. \nTo setup aliases, create an empty file in your home directory and name it .bash_aliases. Notice the period at the beginning of the name that will make the file hidden. You can use the touch command (touch .bash_aliases) to create the file.\nUsing your favorite text editor open the file you just created and start making your aliases. But there are few things you should keep in mind, the syntax should be:\nalias subl='sublime_text'\n\nYou can create an alias for commands with arguments. For instance, if you want to use subl for editing text.txt, you can create the following alias\nalias subl='sublime_text text.txt'\n\n\nA: Creating an alias and putting it in ~/.bashrc will do:\nprintf \"\\nalias subl=$(which sublime_text)\" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc\n\nThere are also other methods like creating functions or syslinks but alias is most suitable for this case.\n", "Q: Is the ubuntu OS the same version across Phones, Tablets, and PCs?

You have to select the boot device inside your UEFI boot menu, not GRUB. \nBut you have to take care that you are not only erasing the partitions, but the boot sector as well, otherwise you will still get to the GRUB rescue console.\nAnd be aware that deleting a partition is NOT nuking the data it contained. Advanced tools can still restore it. Formatting each partition (no quick format!) is better, but the safest option is to download a tool that overwrites all data several times on the disk.\nDon't know whether the built-in dd command can do that too or whether it will damage the hdd (it is also known as disk destroyer) .

So, I got Ubuntu yesterday, and enthusiastically started to install all my linux supported steam games. Only about two of them worked, and the rest crashed instantly back to steam without error messages, with the exception of Portal, which gives a messages saying it has to deal with OpenGL. I believe this issues is caused by my graphics card drivers. I have a Radeon 6670.

However now I just have a Ubuntu install and it won't boot. I've tried boot-repair and it still won't boot.  \nWhat should I try next? \n\nA: Depending on the cause of your problem, updating or reinstalling the GRUB bootloader may be sufficient to fix it. One way to attempt that is to follow these the steps below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine your normal system partition:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nLook for the / partition.\n\n*If the partition is /dev/sda2, mount the partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt\n\nYou may need to change /dev/sda2 to a different partition, depending on what you discovered in the first step.\n\n*Bind-mount some other necessary stuff:\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\n\n\n*chroot into your Ubuntu install:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n\n*Now you're running your install in root and not the live CD so you can run:\nupdate-grub\n\n\n*If you face errors, you might have to re-install GRUB\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nupdate-grub\n\nUsually this is /dev/sda, but if your system is installed on a different physical disk (as revealed in the first step), you may need to change this accordingly to say /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, etc.\n\n*Hopefully everything works. Run these commands to exit the chroot and reboot the system:\nexit\nsudo reboot\n\nFor other ways to repair GRUB and further explanation, see RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows and Grub2/Installing → Fixing a Broken System.\n", "Q: Will creating a text file in vi change my computer? I know that Linux is an operating system built on text files. What I would like to do is create a file using vi of all the various commands I have learned. That way I could find each individual command very easily using the / in vi. But I only want to do this if it doesn't change the way that my computer functions. Would this be a good idea? \n\nA: neon_overload has a very good answer.\nI'll expand a bit on a certain facet of your question - I would make this a comment, but I don't have enough reputation on here.\nLinux, as an operating system, is very much NOT based on text-files.\nThat said, I can kind of see where you are coming from. To an outside observer, there is a fair bit of going on with editing and launching \"text\" files, especially compared to Windows.\nThis has several reasons, some of which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no registry system in Linux, like is in Windows. Therefore, it is common for applications to store their settings in textfiles, and you would be instructed to edit them, rather than edit registry like in Windows.\n\n*Linux is very widely used as a server system, and many of those, who use it on desktops do work with server systems. Unlike Windows Server, Linux servers usually run without a graphical interface. Therefore, products that are expected to run on Linux servers, and, indeed, their users and administrators, are expected to work without a graphical interface. Products (and system features, worth saying) that are only expected to run on Windows are usually more GUI centered (like, say MS SQL)\n\n*Linux scripting system is somewhat more common and more transparent than Windows. You would see scripts on Windows - but they would be called something.vbs or another.bat. You wouldn't neccesarily realize they are text files - but, considering what is in my second point, it is much more common in Linux to go snooping around .sh files.\n\n*Lastly, many users of Linux are accustomed to working without graphical interface, and will, for many things, rather edit the files directly as they would without GUI, rather than fumbling around with graphical tools. I know that when I want to do something deeper in the system, I just start the terminal, and so do many of my colleagues.\n\n\nA: Writing a text file isn't going to \"change the way that your computer functions\".\nIn particular, in order to do something like that, you'd have to do one of\n\n\n*\n\n*overwrite some important file\n\n*write your file to a special protected location like a *.d directory in /etc; you won't have permission to do this\n\n*mark the file executable and put it in your path\n\n\nSince you're not going to explicitly be doing anything like this, there is nothing to be worried about.  In particular, the other answer goes to unnecessary lengths by suggesting your text files need to begin with hashes on every line.  Of course they don't.  Just storing a text file somewhere within a normal home directory is not going to do anything.\n\nA: You can save all the commands you have learned in a file but some important points to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't make the file executable \n\n*Never source the file\n\n*The best way would be to put a # in the beginning of all the commands to comment out all the commands so they don't get executed accidentally. This way you can actually search for the command you need  and also would be risk free. You can add # at the start of each line by the following command:\nsed -i 's/^/#/' <file_name>\nEDIT: I have given the third point as an extreme security measure, as \"neon_overload\" and \"David Z\" pointed out that putting hashes in all the lines is too extensive and hence not needed, i would second with them in this context. Also as pointed out by \"random832\", a far better alternative to my third point would be to start the file with exit, as no later commands will be executed then.\nEDIT-2: \"Rinzwind\" has mentioned two important points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not overwrite an existing file \n\n*Store the file in the user's home directory (/home/$USER/).\n\nA: The short answer is, no, you won't change your computer by creating a text file in vi. However, if you aren't careful, creating that first text file just might change your life. Learning the Unix way can be a deeply rewarding practice.\n\nA: vi is a text editor, therefore if all you want is just store some text snippets in a text file, and search through it, then you can do it all directly from the terminal with the built-in commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a note to a text file (will create the file if it didn't exist):\necho note with important data >> info.txt\nIMPORTANT: Watch out for single and double quotes, and prefix them with slashes if you want them included.\n\n\n*Search the file for some text (e.g. important):\ngrep --color -i important info.txt\nTo avoid typing --color -i that should be aliased in your ~/.bashrc.\nYou can also add multiline text to existing or non-existing text files:\ncat >> info2.txt\n\nthen type or paste the text, and when done then press CTR+Z\nAs for changing the system, no, it won't change the way your system works as long as you create files in your own home folder and don't execute them (you can execute a file even if it's not executable, e.g. with bash myFile). Also make sure you only use the root privileges strictly when you need them.\nAnd finally, your interpretation of file-based system has misled you somewhat: most operating system have files that store important settings which deeply affect the way the system operates, but they are located in predefined locations and typically are protected from modification by regular users.\nIt is possible though to easily shoot yourself in the foot, for example, if as a regular user you have a local  'executable' folder that you added to PATH, and if in that folder you happen to have executable files that have same names as built-in common utilities or bash keywords, such as test, echo, cat, for, cut, etc.\n", "Q: how to interface xenserver and ubuntu14.04 i install xenserver hypervisor in 1st laptop and in 2nd laptop i installed ubuntu 14.04 LTS with openstack using devstack installation.

This means that the running OS is not accessing them. You can recognize a mounted partition by the key symbol next to its name in gParted and you will see that both of your partitions (mount points / and swap) are mounted. \nSo it is impossible when you boot from your installed Ubuntu version, you have to boot from a live media. Insert the Ubuntu installation DVD/USB stick, select \"Try Ubuntu\" and run gParted from within this live session. You will see that the partitions on the hard disk are now unmounted (no key symbols) and you can modify them.\nAnyway: Partitioning always might lead to data loss. So backup your important data before performing this. Especially operations like shrinking/moving partitions may damage the data, while moving the left border of a bootable partition might lead to problems with GRUB and no booting anymore.

CVE patches only.\n  The upstream version number does not change, the Debian or Ubuntu version number does change: Foo 1.2.3-1ubuntu2 becomes Foo 1.2.3-1ubuntu3\nYou can easily enable automatic updates for *-security repos in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades or in Ubuntu's Software & Updates control panel.\nAlso: If you enable the *-updates repository, then you will get those minor improvements you don't mind. But the system has no way to determine if an update is too much for your comfort...it's not psychic...so perhaps you should disable that repository. \nFinally: Some users get confused when a famous vulnerability gets discovered, and the upstream project seems to recommend upgrading to the latest version to fix it.

This all happened after I did the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ran VirtualBox \n\n*Created a VDI drive\n\n*Installed Kali Linux (When asked if I would like to encrypt the whole drive I said yes)\n\n\nAfter Khali was installed it went all haywire and I deleted the Kali Linux virtual machine with its files and shutdown the host as normal. This morning when I powered up the pc I was unable to use my default password to access my hosts’ hard drive.\nWas there a way that Kali might have re-encrypted the drive? Because I was under the impression that it was only die 8.5 gig VDI drive that was encrypted. Is there a way that I can restore Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to a previous state before Khali was installed on the virtual machine?\n\nA: The only way I can think your Kali guest would have had any impact on your host HD is if somehow you have shared folders configured. But even so, sounds a bit far fetched.\nWas there anything else happening recently? A system upgrade? \nAs for VBox and your Kali guest, the \"HD\" of the guest itself is only a file (or several, depends, irrelevant ATM) and whatever you do to that \"HD\" should have no impact on the host's partitions.\nWith more info maybe more people can help.

I have been waiting in case a fresher update fixes this, but no such luck so far.\nWhen enabled as an extended desktop, it appears that the two monitors are somewhat overlayed on each other, but the image on the screens appears stretched too.  Certain areas of the screen, mouse clicking is offset somewhat too.\nAttached are a photo of the 'corrupted' display, a screenshot of the display when corrupted (though this actually looks reasonable) and a screenshot of the updates that were installed in December, to cause the issue.\nAny idea what has caused the fault or how I can fix it?\nThanks,\nWhytey\n\n\n\n\nA: The compiz fix suggested here solved the problem for me.\n\nFrancisco Gouveia (fgouveia87) wrote on 2015-03-10:\nAfter days lost with replacing NVidia drivers and manually editing xorg.conf\nfile, I finally found this!\nRockwalrus (rockwalrus) solution works!\nOn CompizConfig Settings Manager, go to \"General Options\", then\n\"Display Settings\" and do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck \"Deteck Outputs\"\n\n*In the Outputs array, set the resolutions of each of your screens.

I have two full\nHD screens, so I added the following configuration: 1920x1080+0+0\n1920x1080+1920+0\n\nThe second output has an offset of 1920, because it is on the right\nside of the first output, which has a width of 1920.\n\n\nA: So, there have been a couple of updates come through since I posed the question, but they didn't seem to solve my ability to configure dual screen using the 'Screen Display' applet.\nThrough a stroke of genius, I wondered what would happen if I use the Fn + F1 keys on the laptop to cycle through the display options.

What I expect from two commands which always produce the same output on their own, is them to always produce the same output when put in a pipeline, but apparently this is not the case for tar | gzip:\n~/test$ ls\n~/test$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=file bs=10000000 count=1\n1+0 records in\n1+0 records out\n10000000 bytes (10 MB) copied, 0,877671 s, 11,4 MB/s // Creating a 10MB random file\n~/test$ tar cf file.tar file // Archiving the file in a tarball\n~/test$ tar cf file1.tar file // Archiving the file again in another tarball\n~/test$ cmp file.tar file1.tar // Comparing the two output files\n~/test$ gzip -c file > file.gz // Compressing the file with gzip\n~/test$ gzip -c file > file1.gz // Compressing the file again with gzip\n~/test$ cmp file.gz file1.gz // Comparing the two output files\n~/test$ tar c file | gzip > file.tar.gz // Archiving and compressing the file\n~/test$ tar c file | gzip > file1.tar.gz // Archiving and compressing the file again\n~/test$ cmp file.tar.gz file1.tar.gz // Comparing the output files\nfile.tar.gz file1.tar.gz differ: byte 5, line 1 // File differs at byte 5\n~/test$ cmp -i 5 file.tar.gz file1.tar.gz // Comparing the output files after byte 5\n~/test$ \n\nAdding to this, even tar cfz file.tar file on his own always produces different outputs:\n~/test$ tar cfz file2.tar file // Archiving and compressing the file\n~/test$ tar cfz file3.tar file // Archiving and compressing the file again\n~/test$ cmp file2.tar.gz file3.tar.gz // Comparing the output files\nfile2.tar.gz file3.tar.gz differ: byte 5, line 1 // File differs at byte 5\n~/test$ cmp -i 5 file2.tar.gz file3.tar.gz // Comparing the output files after byte 5\n~/test$ \n\nWhile splitting the pipeline finally produces an output that makes sense:\n~/test$ gzip -c file.tar > file4.tar.gz\n~/test$ gzip -c file.tar > file5.tar.gz\n~/test$ cmp file4.tar.gz file5.tar.gz \n~/test$ \n\nIt looks like whatever happens happens only when tar's output is piped directly into gzip.\nWhat is the explanation of this behavior?\n\nA: Gzip files include a timestamp. If you create two gzip files at different times, these will different by the creation time, not by content.\n\nA: The header for the resulting gzip file is different depending on how it is called.\nGzip tries to store some origin information in the resulting file header. When called on normal files this includes the origin file name by default and a timestamp, which it gets from the original file.\nWhen it is made to compress data piped to it, the origin is not as easy as with a normal file, so it resorts to a different naming and time stamp convention. \nTo prove this try adding the -n param to the offending lines in your example as...\n~/temp$ tar c file | gzip -n > file1.tar.gz\n~/temp$ tar c file | gzip -n > file.tar.gz\n~/temp$ cmp file.tar.gz file1.tar.gz\n\nNow the files are identical again...\nFrom man gzip ...\n\n   -n --no-name\n          When  compressing,  do  not save the original file name and time\n          stamp by default. (The original name is always saved if the name\n          had  to  be  truncated.)  When decompressing, do not restore the\n          original file name if present (remove only the gzip suffix  from\n          the  compressed  file name) and do not restore the original time\n          stamp if present (copy it from the compressed file). This option\n          is the default when decompressing.\n\n\nSo the difference is indeed the original file name and time stamp information that is turned off by the -n param.\n", "Q: Wifi hard blocked I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS on my Lenovo-G50-30 laptop, replacing Windows 8.

In case there is a GPT parts of the primary GPT are overwritten.\nThe second command writes 512B of zeros. In case there is a GPT the primary table will still be intact. (The conv=notrunc option does not make any difference because all data on the disk are lost anyways.)\nAny secondary GPT at the end of the disc is left untouched by these commands.\nThe third command starts writing at the partition XX and does not remove the partition table.\nThis should erase your MBR or GPT.\nsgdisk -Z /dev/sdX\n\nAfter that you should be able to create a new MBR or GTP.\n\nA: Booted in a live usb session and did \nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=1M\n\nBut that didn't seem o work as I wanted, as the light for the processor working was mostly off (or is it the hdd light?), while the cooler was very loud.\nThen I read that the urandom command is very slow as it is really trying to produce really random numbers.

This way when I go to open up pictures, videos, and music it will open up the same location on the 200GB parttion as I have it set to do in Windows.\n\nA: Use symbolic linking.\nFirst, you need to mount your 200Gb partition, if that has not already happened. You need to use the mount command to mount the partition manually; if that goes well, you may want to edit /etc/fstab to have the partition automatically mounted at reboot. \nSuppose the partition is mounted at /media/largedisk, and that all your music is stored in /media/largedisk/Music/. Then, move everything in /home/youruser/Music out of the way so that it is empty, then remove the empty directory: rmdir /home/youruser/Music. Now, create a link to the new partition: ln -s /media/largedisk/Music /home/youruser/Music. Now everytime you use the folder /home/youruser/Music, you will in fact be addressing the Music directory on the other partition. To remove this, simply rm /home/youruser/Music: this will only remove the link, not the Music folder on the other partition.\nThen repeat for videos, photos, etc.\n", "Q: Cannot get Ubuntu to boot besides Windows 8.1 on an HP ProBook My HP ProBook 4540s has Window 8.1 installed, but I need Linux (Ubuntu) as well.

As for GCC, try installing build-essential from here. It includes GCC and its dependencies. \n\nA: Aside from not having an internet connection, you will have to face the issue that Ubuntu 13.10 is an end-of-life (EOL) release and is no longer supported.\nIn general, the most reliable way to identify and download the gcc package along with its missing dependencies from a system with no internet connection is probably to use\napt-get install --print-uris gcc\n\nor perhaps better\napt-get install --print-uris build-essential\n\non the Ubuntu machine, and then use the listed URLs to download the packages on your internet-connected computer.

Your source port is 54179 and the destination port is 80. This might be due to browsing some site or any other program using it,  the TIME_WAIT indicates that the connection has been closed from your end but waiting for any delayed packets from the remote peer.

I need to install nfs-kernel-server on the individual nodes so I can access to and process the files from a single node. But I am unable to apt-get install nfs-kernel-server or apt-get update.

The cluster does however, has some NFS and NIS set up. I can't afford to have them ruined. Will updating to 14.04 risk anything? I am fairly new to Linux so I don't know the details of how the cluster is set up.\n\nA: What you're asking can be described by this metaphor:\n\"I've got these leaking boots and there's this freezing rain and my feet are really cold, but I don't want to run around barefoot while getting my boots repaired...\"\nWell, get some spare boots (take a system backup of your cluster), get your boots repaired (upgrade your cluster during its maintenance window) and if anything goes wrong, keep walking in your current boots (restore your system back-up and learn from your mistakes and try again and again and again until it works)...\nOr hire a shoemaker and have him repair your boots while you wear them.  (Get a consultant and have him/her/it upgrade your system for you).\nJust get the damn thing upgraded: you're a disaster waiting to happen!\n\nA: If you want to get support you need to be running a supported release of Ubuntu. 9.10 has not been supported for quite some time now. When support for a release is terminated, the archive is moved off the main updates mirrors and onto an old releases archive server. There will be no further updates to it, security or otherwise.

Mine (E540) and another model (E440) have a BIOS bug that has a very similar sounding effect. (On my model, the workaround is to turn off USB3.0 in the BIOS settings.) \nIf you confirm the problem affects only linux, I hope you raise a stink with Lenovo in their support forums, or through the place you bought it. Lenovo has a reputation for supporting linux, but things like this imply their stance has changed and they don't even test linux anymore. \nHere's the Lenovo forum for your model laptop.

I tried mount/umounting both the drives and the RAID /dev/md127, but they were still coming back as busy. So, I tried seeing if I could find a process, but\n$ sudo lsof | grep /dev/\n\nfailed to return anything that might point to the cause.\n\nA: I finally figured out that Ubuntu created a physical volume when I created my RAID, and that if I took the PV and made a logical volume and partitioned that, I could mount the LV no problem. \nUse pvdisplay to check for the creation of a new physical volume. If the RAID is part of a volume group, create a logical volume using lvcreate -L (size) -n (name) . Format and mount the partition as usual.\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 won't open DVD's ubuntu 14.04 won't play DVD's.\nI have installed all the \"Restricted\", libdvdread4, libdvdnav4, etc.etc. regionset is also okay. none of the ubuntu players will open the DVD's. On the same PC, other Hard drive, Windows 8.1 plays without problem.Slowly at a loss as to what to do.\n\nA: Have you tried the VLC player? That is normally the best option for playing anything that won't play with the other videoplayers. \nCan't you play any dvd's or is it just certain ones that won't play? Some dvds come with a really nasty copy-protection and I don't get them to play with the normal ubuntu video player either (so far anything worked with VLC, though).\nAnd what happens if you try to open the dvd? Do you get an error message of any kind?\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu desktop besides Unity can I drag rearrange taskbar icons? I really hate Unity, so I want another desktop experience, preferably one similar to Windows.\nI have tried Lubuntu, Xubuntu, and Kubuntu, but why do these all feel so old? I cannot rearrange open taskbar tabs like I can in Windows 7. If you don't know what I'm talking about just think about your browser how easy you can rearrange the tabs, I want the same thing for the taskbar. But in Lubuntu and Xubuntu it stays locked and static; once opened it cannot move..\nAre there any Ubuntu distributions that can drag open tabs around?\n\nA: Try Cinnamon.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon \n\nSee here: Cinnamon Installing tutorial and How-to- geek\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu on a mac mini using blutooth mouse/keyboard I tried to install ubuntu on my mac mini. the first step is textual (we can choose to check hard drive, try ubuntu, install ubuntu, oem install) and my keyboard apple blutooth work just well but  at the moment im enter in the graphical installation my keyboard and my mouse dont work HELP!\n\nA: I did not get that to work either, i found it easyer to just plug in a usb mouse/kb afterwards once its installed bluetooth kb worked for me.\n", "Q: \"Are you sure you want to proceed?\" message on login I am getting the message below each time I am logging in. I am using Ubuntu 14.04 x64.\nThe message first appeared after I tried to install Elementary OS Pantheon session, which didn't work.\nI had to completely reinstall my system, but the message keeps appearing.\nTherefore, it probably created something in my home folder, but I don't know what and where to look.\nAnyone got any hints? I didn't find any elementary folder in my /home.\nI also checked .profile and startup applications, but nothing.\n\n\nA: I figured it out after some digging. I have a script in my .profile file that changes some settings for touchpad and keyboard. I've been using it for a few years, but didn't get this error before.\nSome of the commands from the script seem not to be working anymore:\nxinput set-int-prop \"VertResolution\" 7\nxinput set-int-prop \"HorizResolution\" 5\nxinput --set-prop --type=float \"Logitech Unifying Device. Wireless PID:4013\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\"\n\nE.g.:\n$ xinput set-int-prop \"VertResolution\" 7\nUsage: xinput set-int-prop <device> <property> <format (8, 16, 32)> <val> [<val> ...]\n\nI assume that when .profile is loaded and those errors are returned, the system pops that message, because when I run them manually, I don't get the pop-up.\nAnyway, I commented them out and I don't get the message anymore.\nSo the source of problems was in my .profile\n\nA: I got the same thing starting yesterday when I installed updates.\nI found that any command in .profile that generates output causes this.\nIf you eliminate the output, the commands still run and this dialog doesn't appear.\nFor example, I had a line like this:\nxgamma -gamma 0.7\n\nI changed it to this and the mysterious dialog no longer appears:\nxgamma -gamma 0.7 >& /dev/null\n\nI don't know why this happens, it looks like a bug. But at least this makes it go away.\n\nA: I had the same problem when upgrading to the latest Ubuntu 20.04. But I was not even able to click on the OK button, thus not able to login at all.\nHow I solved it:\n\n*\n\n*Switched to the text console by hitting Ctrl+Alt+F4 (switching back with Ctrl+Alt+F7).\n\n\n*Tried to login with my username and password in the console. It indicated  an error while login (some problem with thefuck).\n\n\n*I reinstalled the package and rebooted the system.\n\n\n*Problem solved!\nIt's probably a good idea for you to login over the text console because it may indicate the underlying problem.\n", "Q: Dropbox indexing is much slower in Ubuntu than in WIndows I dual-boot Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8 with a shared NTFS storage partition. My dropbox folder is on this shared partition.\nFirst, I notice that whenever I switch back and forth between the two OSes, Dropbox has to re-index everything. Do you know why?\nSecond, even though Dropbox syncs and indexes very quickly in Windows, it never finishes indexing in Ubuntu. The official Dropbox help suggests that this is a permission / ownership problem, so I change the ownership of my shared partition (and all of the sub-dir) to me instead of root. Still, the problem persists.\nWhat to do in this situation?\n\nA: I believe Dropbox re-indexes the files when you switch because it sees that something has modified the indexes when you switch operating systems. Since you are using Dropbox, why don't you just have it manage the filesystems separately -- an NTFS filesystem when you are running in Windows, and an ext4 (or whatever you prefer) filesystem when you are in linux. Mixing the Windows and Ubuntu Dropbox clients on the same filesystem is very likely causing the issue.\n", "Q: Tablet text input I'm installing v.14.10 on a tablet but haven't been able to locate or access an onscreen keyboard. Is one available in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes, it is called onboard. I am not sure if that is a different one, but when you click on the accessibility button in the top bar (blue circle with a white stickman), you should also see a menu entry for showing an on-screen keyboard.\nSome images to clarify the answer:  \n \nAccessibility button ^ . . . . . . . . . . ^ Accessibility menu\nonboard on-screen keyboard window . . . v \n\n", "Q: can i install ubuntu with out formating disk I have on my computer windows 7, and I bought external disk. Can I install ubuntu on my external hdd, and keep windows on computer without formatting either the ssd disk on computer nor the external disk. on both I have files I need. \nCan I just install Ubuntu on the external HD without formatting?\n\nA: Boot to Windows, defrag the external disk. Boot to Ubuntu and run gparted to resize the external drive to make the partition smaller, the run the install program.\nInside the install program, be sure to put Ubuntu on the external, and put the bootloader on the internal drive if you want to, or on the external if you want to be able to move the external to to other computers. Just know that if you put the boot loader on the external drive, you are going to have to either change the boot order in BIOS to boot USB first, or select USB every time you want to boot Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Why does 'echo *' give different results than 'ls *'? For example, if you are in home directory and type ls *, you will have all the directories listed, and below the name of the listed directory, the files that it contains. On the other hand, if you type echo * the command will list just the directories, and not the directories and content that they have. Why is that?\n\nA: In both cases the * gets expanded by the shell. \necho than just prints the parameters resulting from the expansion.\nls checks for every parameter if it is a directory and lists its contents if it is one.\n", "Q: Desktop freezes after upgrade to 14.10 I upgraded to 14.10 from 14.04. And I use Ubuntu+Kubuntu.\nTemporary solution is, after freeze, I do Fn+F1 (Suspend), and then click Power button (Wake), and everything returns to normal, till next freeze.\nAny permanent solutions?\n\nA: Sometimes, kinks are introduced when upgrading like that (straight from one version to another, in this case trusty (14.04) to utopic (14.10)).\nWhat I would suggest as a permanent solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup whatever data you want/need to keep.\n\n*Obtain the ISO of Ubuntu Utopic (14.10) and do a fresh install via a CD or bootable USB.\n\n*OPTIONAL: Zero (wipe out your drive with zeros) before installing a fresh copy.\n\n", "Q: Why is the IP \"92.242.140.21\" connecting to one of my ports?

When I've booted Ubuntu, my USB mouse does not work. The laser is lighting during the boot process, but when the login screen appears, it goes out.

Whenever I boot Windows 8 (where the USB never causes any problems), then I reboot and select Ubuntu from the GRUB menu, it suddenly works. How can a functioning USB under Windows cause it to work properly after rebooting into Ubuntu?\n\nA: Okay, the problem got kind of resolved by changing to the latest Ubuntu version (15.10 Wily). I also removed Windows from my laptop when I installed Wily, so this is now a single-boot system, if this was in any way related to the problem. In Ubuntu Wily I haven't discovered any problems so far.\n", "Q: How to encrypt folder once, for sending? Most encryption programs seem to be made for encrypting a folder permanently. \nI, however, simply want to encrypt a folder once and send it as an email attachment to someone. I feel like TrueCrypt, encfs, and others are used for constant encryption.\nWhat program can do this?\n\nA: Unix philosophy favors composability over monolythic design. In this sense, your problem can be split into two separate problems:\n- How do I bundle a folder into a single file suitable for sending?\nYou can do that with tar command:\ntar zcf ./myfiles.tar.gz ./myfolder/ \n\n- How do I encrypt a single file?\nThere's already an answer for that. For example:\nopenssl des3 < ./myfiles.tar.gz > ./myfiles.tar.gz.des3\n\nTo decrypt the file you can then use\nopenssl des3 -d < ./myfiles.tar.gz.des3 > ./myfiles-decrypted.tar.gz\n\nAnd, finally, to \"untar\" the file into a directory:\ntar zxf ./myfiles-decrypted.tar.gz\n\n", "Q: How to open up 700mb file What text editor for Linux can open up 700mb text file for editing? Please advice, Kate & Jedit does not work out\n\nA: GNU Emacs.\n\nOld versions (i.e., anything before 19.29) of GNU Emacs had problems editing files larger than 8 megabytes. As of version 19.29, the maximum buffer size is at least 2^27-1, or 134,217,727 bytes. On a 64bit system, the limit is pushed to 2^59-1 which is almost a million Terabytes.\n\nVim\n\nMaximum file size 2147483647 bytes (2 Gbyte) when a long integer is 32 bits. Much more for 64 bit longs. Also limited by available disk space for the |swap-file|.\n\n", "Q: C Using Libraries Without IDE This may be a stupid question. How do you use C libraries without an IDE? I want to only use a text editor.\n\nA: (does this really belong here)? \nExample: using the math library. Create this file with your preferred editor: \n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>  //this declare the math library \n\nint main() {\n        printf(\"%f\\n\", sin(1.0)); // using math and stdio library \n        return 0;\n}\n\nThen you compile: \ngcc -o test test.c -lm -lc\n\nRead: compile test.c to an executable called test using the libraries libc and libm (Notice: you do not need to use explicitly -lc -lm because they are linked in by default when needed; this is just an example --- other libraries you have to explicitly tell).\nRun it: \n[romano:~/tmp] % ./test                    \n0.841471\n\nVoilá. \nYou can get information for the library using section 3 of the man pages; for example \nman 3 sin: \n\nSIN(3)                     Linux Programmer's Manual                  SIN(3)\n\nNAME\n       sin, sinf, sinl - sine function\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       #include <math.h>\n\n       double sin(double x);\n\n[...]\n\nand so on. \n\nA: Follow the simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up any text-editor you want to write your program in.\n\n*Write a simple program, or any program in C, you want.\n\n*\n*\n\n*Now if you want to add any library in you program, it has the same procedure as it is in an IDE. For example I want to add a library in program named as system library, then I would write:\n#include<sys/types.h>\n\nand then write my rest of the program. \n\n*now save the file anywhere you want, with an extension of .c. For example: I saved my first file on my desktop, name as HelloWorld.c.\n\n\n*In terminal, go to the directory where you have saved your file.\n\n*Type the following command to create an executable file in the same directory:\ngcc –o executable HelloWorld.c\n\n\n*This creates a file named as executable in the same directory where the .c file is present.\n\n*To run the executable file, type the following command:\n./executable\n\nand this prints or performs the tasks of your program. \nIn a nutshell, whatever you use to write the C program, whether its a text editor or an IDE like dev c++, it will work same. IDEs just save your time in writing those commands every time to compile the program.\nHappy Coding :)  \n", "Q: Acer Notebook rightclick not working I have a problem with my acer e5-571 running Ubuntu 14.04.  \nThe touchpad isn't recognized correctly: I have no right click.  \nOutput from xinput list:\nVirtual core pointer                        id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n  ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                  id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n  ↳ SYN1B7E:01 06CB:2970 UNKNOWN                id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\nVirtual core keyboard                       id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n  ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard                 id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n  ↳ Power Button                                id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n  ↳ Video Bus                                   id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n  ↳ Power Button                                id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n  ↳ Sleep Button                                id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n  ↳ HD WebCam                                   id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n  ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard                id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n  ↳ Acer WMI hotkeys                            id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nSometimes there is no cursor at all, and I have to restart a few times till I get one.\nAny help / workarounds are greatly appreciated.\nOutput from Synclient:\nParameter settings:\n    LeftEdge                = 49\n    RightEdge               = 1187\n    TopEdge                 = 48\n    BottomEdge              = 850\n    FingerLow               = 25\n    FingerHigh              = 30\n    MaxTapTime              = 180\n    MaxTapMove              = 67\n    MaxDoubleTapTime        = 180\n    SingleTapTimeout        = 180\n    ClickTime               = 100\n    EmulateMidButtonTime    = 75\n    EmulateTwoFingerMinZ    = 282\n    EmulateTwoFingerMinW    = 7\n    VertScrollDelta         = 30\n    HorizScrollDelta        = 30\n    VertEdgeScroll          = 0\n    HorizEdgeScroll         = 0\n    CornerCoasting          = 0\n    VertTwoFingerScroll     = 1\n    HorizTwoFingerScroll    = 1\n    MinSpeed                = 1\n    MaxSpeed                = 1.75\n    AccelFactor             = 0.130976\n    TouchpadOff             = 2\n    LockedDrags             = 0\n    LockedDragTimeout       = 5000\n    RTCornerButton          = 2\n    RBCornerButton          = 3\n    LTCornerButton          = 0\n    LBCornerButton          = 0\n    TapButton1              = 1\n    TapButton2              = 3\n    TapButton3              = 0\n    ClickFinger1            = 1\n    ClickFinger2            = 3\n    ClickFinger3            = 0\n    CircularScrolling       = 0\n    CircScrollDelta         = 0.1\n    CircScrollTrigger       = 0\n    CircularPad             = 0\n    PalmDetect              = 0\n    PalmMinWidth            = 10\n    PalmMinZ                = 200\n    CoastingSpeed           = 20\n    CoastingFriction        = 50\n    PressureMotionMinZ      = 30\n    PressureMotionMaxZ      = 160\n    PressureMotionMinFactor = 1\n    PressureMotionMaxFactor = 1\n    ResolutionDetect        = 1\n    GrabEventDevice         = 0\n    TapAndDragGesture       = 1\n    AreaLeftEdge            = 0\n    AreaRightEdge           = 0\n    AreaTopEdge             = 0\n    AreaBottomEdge          = 0\n    HorizHysteresis         = 7\n    VertHysteresis          = 7\n    ClickPad                = 0\n\n\nA: I found a solution for my VN7-571G-56N0\nTouchpad:\n↳ SYN1B7F:00 06CB:2970 UNKNOWN\n\nMy solution isn't nice but its a workaround.

LVM) and I chose a strong password with special characters which works out fine every single time I play around with it during the Ubuntu installation.\nHowever once the installation was finished and my desktop computer rebooted for the first time, it was all black, not going anywhere passed the motherboard boot screen?\nI hit the \"reset\" button on my case to double check, rebooted once more, only this time I was greeted with an GNU GRUB menu with four options and I chose \"Ubuntu\", then the much anticipated Ubuntu-logo and a text telling me to \"enter passphrase\" in order for me to unlock my disk with my chosen encryption password came up; however despite knowing that I had typed the correct password at least a hundred times (checked if caps lock or numpad was causing this, which it wasn’t) it still refuses to decrypt on login with the following error message: \"cryptsetup: cryptsetup failed, bad password or options?\".\nWhat's going on here? Why is it that my password work every single time when I play around with it during the installation, but whenever I try to actually decrypt and login to Ubuntu it fails?\nAre there any characters (super characters) that aren't allowed in the encryption password or could this be a bug because of my Swedish keyboard layout?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the keyboard layout DOES matter. :(\nOn bootup, you start with the US Keyboard layout. As your filesystem is decrypted (entering the correct password), any settings changing keyboard layout (such as you changing it to Swedish Keyboard Layout) will be applied.\nWhat I suggest is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a fresh install again. (sorry)\n\n*When installing Ubuntu, just leave the keyboard layout alone (leave it to US).\n\n*AFTER successfully installing Ubuntu and decrypting your filesystem on the first boot, THEN you can change the keyboard layout.\n\n\nSee this Unix Stack Exchange post for more details.\n\nA: I had this same problem as I had written my password at setup with my Portuguese keyboard thinking I'd be writing it with the Portuguese keyboard layout; since during the setup the keyboard layout is in US my password turned out to be something else. The way I was able to decrypt the disk was by changing the layout on another computer to US and writing my password as if the Portuguese layout was the one in use, this writes up the password as it was stored.\nFor example, for me the key combinations for | generated a ~.\nAfter writing the password with the US Keyboard Layout as if I was using my layout I get the character sequence I have to write to decrypt the disk and it's solved.\n\nA: I had this problem too and while it still exists for me I have identified a workaround that enables my system to boot. My issue was to do with cryptsetup not accepting my password. This prevents me for booting and fixing system issues. \nTurns out that my password included a special character '@' as in P@ssword. At the prompt pressing RIGHT SHIFT and key 2 does not generate a '@' instead a '2' is generated. This can be confirmed by switching over to another TTY and typing in the password (CTRL + ALT + F1). I noted that using LEFT SHIFT and key 2 generated the '@' control character. Thus if LEFT SHIFT is used in complex password it will be typed correctly and cryptsetup will be able to decrypt the volume.  \nNote the Ubuntu install program rates user password with Poor, Fair, or Good thus encouraging the use of special characters leading to this scenario in the ubuntu recovery mode.\n\nA: The Point is that at the time someone set the password for cryptsetup during install, the keyboard layout is english. therefore your password is set in english. and that means only a few keystrokes are wrong. when the install is complete the keyboard layout during startup already is in the language you selected during install. But your password is wrong because set in english keyboard layout. Why dont simply correct the password? Startup with the twisted password, login, and change it! There is a tool called \"gnome-disk-utility\". Install it and you have a nice tool where you can manage your partitions, create imges of them and... change encryption passwords! If you are using your prefered layout inside kde gnome or whatever now you can correct your password. There is NO need to install the system again.\n", "Q: How do I merge two Home folders into one after reinstalling Ubuntu? I did a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04.2.

I simply copied & pasted. \nAt last I deleted my old profile that I didn't need anymore.

If I'll be in a hurry I'm sure I will not want to wait 5s until I'll be sure it went off. I'll be closing the lid, throwing laptop into backpack and running. :)\n\nA: I've written a script that counts seconds with the lid closed[1] and shutdowns the system after 1 minute. I've seen that every once in a few months my laptop will not go to suspend[2] and it will get REALLY hot inside my backpack and I'll get really sad/mad. \nAnyway to answer your direct question here is a script that will beep every 1 second when lid is closed:\nwhile sleep 1; do\n    grep 'closed' /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state && beep\ndone\n\nBut I don't recommend you use it. The reason is that I've not found a reliable way to make a loud beep from a laptop (or most today’s desktops). And besides: what if you don't hear the beeps (your laptop is most likely inside a bag that protects it and suppresses audio output from it)? I suggest you just shutdown the system after one minute of beeps.\n\n[1] I'm checking the contents of /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state to find out if the lid is closed.\n[2] syslog will have a line stating that Freezing of tasks failed after 20.xxx seconds\n\nA: Long answer short: put the laptop into shutdown/hibernate mode whilst in a backpack.\nNo need to worry about overheating.\n", "Q: How to downgrade the gnome terminal I want to downgrade the gnome-terminal from 3.10.2 to 3.6.2, like in How to downgrade packages on Ubuntu?

It provides a complete set of data reduction functions for CCD photometry, with frame WCS fitting, automatic star identification, aperture photometry of target and standard stars, single-frame ensemble photometry solution finding, multi-frame color coefficient fitting, extinction coefficient fitting, and all-sky photometry; as well as general-purpose astronomical image processing functions (bias, dark, flat, frame alignment and stacking); It can function as a FITS viewer.\nThe program can control CCD cameras and telescopes, and implement automatic observation scripting. Cameras are controlled through a hardware-specific server, to which gcx connects through a TCP socket. It generates FITS files with comprehensive header information.\n\nA list of possible candidates are on Ubuntu's website, oddly enough.

You can download and run Warthunder through Valve's Steam digital software delivery system. Steam is available in Ubuntu's repositories either by opening up the software center, or by running sudo apt-get install steam from the terminal. Once inside Steam you can open up warthunder by selecting the free game from the Steam store. \nHowever, if you're set on installing the file you downloaded from the website:\nYou're seeing that error because the archive contains a binary executable to install warthunder. Again, in linuxland, downloading a binary from the internet and running it is weird. There are a lot of files in the archive that the installation script might need, so it's best to extract the entire archive, and then run the binary file. \nIn the archive manager program, click extract, and extract the archive to some location (probably either your home directory or ~/Desktop). Open up the directory in the file manager (pcmanfm) and double click on updater. pcmanfm will ask you if you really want to run the executable, and you can choose either to execute it or run it in the terminal. \n", "Q: Software Sources: Select Best HTTPS Server I travel to countries I don't trust--a lot.  For example, Vietnam, the virus capital of the world.  ESPECIALLY in these areas, but also at home in the USA, I want to remove (or reduce) the possibility that someone is intercepting my auto-updates connection and feeding my computer bogus packages.\nMy solution is to switch to a mirror using HTTPS.  But I don't want to pick just any HTTPS server, I want to select the fastest one.  \"Select Best Server\" is available for HTTP (maybe it includes HTTPS, but it never selects HTTPS).  Is there any way to run the same tests searching ONLY mirrors available over HTTPS?\n\nA: There is no need to use HTTPS, as the packages / data you receive are verified by GPG signatures.\nSee this post for more details.\n", "Q: How to find out the HDMI version supported How can I find out which HDMI version the laptop supports, in particular if it is HDMI 1.3?\n\nFull story:\nI'm considering acquiring either a Dell U2414H or Dell U2515H/Dell U2715H (or similar) capable of resolutions of respectively 1920x1080 and 2560x1440. This is for an old laptop with an nvidia 9600M GT, which supposedly can handle a resolution of up to 2560x1600.\nSince the laptop only comes with VGA and HDMI, I'll be using the HDMI port. It seems that to support the resolution of 2560x1440 of the larger monitor I'd need to have HDMI version 1.3; HDMI 1.2 only supports resolutions of up to 1920x1080.¹ This mean that with HDMI 1.3 I can buy the 27-inch monitor, otherwise I'm better of with the 24-inch one.\n¹ I suspect the laptop doesn't support HDMI 1.4 because it got out around the time it was bought.

When I open a terminal in the default gui on tty7 and start vim I can hold shift and press the left or right arrows to move the cursor by whole words. When I open tty1 and start vim I cannot hold shift and press the left and right arrow keys to move the cursors by whole words. Others differences include different colour scheme and different cursor type. My .vimrc file is just autoindent and number and does get loaded by both ttys. Is there another vim configuration file that the terminal application is loading or is there something else causing the difference?\n\nA: Your terminal emulator's colour palette might be different from that of the TTY's framebuffer. How can I change the TTY colors?\nThe same applies to cursor type, since that can be set by the terminal emulator. How to change cursor shape, color, and blinkrate of Linux Console? How to stop cursor from blinking?\nAs for the Shift, it is likely that the X window system interprets Shift+an arrow key as a different event compared to just an arrow key. The terminal emulators interpret whatever X sends them. The console terminal driver probably does not support modifiers like Shift or Ctrl with the arrow keys.\n", "Q: Steam Install Error on 14.04 Ubuntu 64bit I have tried some of the solutions posted elsewhere in the support forum, one seemed like it worked but after a steam update i found myself back at square one  I am a new Linux user and am already at a learning curve :)  Thanks for any help\nReading package lists...

My question is:\nCan anybody point me to a documented case of a flash drive dying from running Ubuntu?\nPeople talk about the dangers and urge cautions, but I have researched on the internet and asked on Ubuntu Forms and have never found a single case of a (name brand) flash drive failure due to running Linux.\nThey say lifespan is 10000 to 100000 writes and up. With wear leveling this seems to work out to years or decades of normal use.\nI am talking about Persistent and Full installs as there is no writing to disk with a Live install.\n\nA: I have broken:\n1 stick physically (verbatim 32GB?, plastic, PCB broken on physical bend),\n1 stick by excessive? write (intenso slim line 64GB, installed veracrypt container, stick switched to read-only after app. 1 hr. of use),\n3 sticks by benchmarking (intenso slim line 64GB, intenso premium line 32GB and 64GB, gnome-disks, benchmark disk, write benchmark, standard settings, unresponsive in first or second pass),\nnone yet by running ubuntu or other linux (kali) in live mode, even with 'encrypted persistence', but that might come as I'll try it 'installed' on a 256GB sandisk ultra-fit ...\n\nA: this is old experience (10 yrs) I ran into usb failures twice. It may have been the old USBs were less rugged(?). I'd assumed without finding references that several attempts writing grub to the USB's MBR had worn out the 0 (beginning) of the flash, rendering it in my case, read only. Subsequent retries lead to unreadable also. Like I stated, this is old and newer USB's may be more dependable.\n\nA: Recently, My Hard Disk had a slow failure.\nSo, I Ran Live Ubuntu Persistent from my Sandisk 16GB.\nFor a week, it ran perfectly and 2 days back the OS abruptly got struck.\nRestarting the device, it was not able to access the pen drive error was showing up.\nTried to Flash using mkusb in another system, and quitted during the middle of the process as it was stuck(to me) maybe the process would have been running.\nThis led to the brick of USBs and its inaccessible anymore.\nPotential Reasons:\n\n*\n\n*Frequent Power Outages leading to abrupt cutoff (At least 10 times)\n\n*Duplicate USB\n\n\nA: I've actually never had one fail in all the time I've been using them, which is about the last 10 years. (Whether they were NVME or traditional SSD)\nThe wear leveling is automatic, but it's not X number of writes as much as it is X number of total GB (or more like TB) and that doesn't mean that the drive will suddenly fail past those threshholds, it means that they're no longer under warranty.\nMost of these drives are rated for more bytes than you could ever write in your life. For example, Samsung Evo Pro 1TB is warrantied to 1200TB written, and you wouldn't get there if you were blowing up a virtual machine the size of the hard drive and rebuilding it for 3-4 years. Enterprise drives (used for servers) have even more insane write thresholds... It's suffice to say most people can never even get close... BUT... if you do...\nThe answer is OVER-PROVISIONING! Your little drive has a certain percentage of storage (sometimes up to twice what the listed size is) that it uses to replace and correct error blocks. It basically isn't in trouble until you have run out of that. Modern SSD/NVME will even let you dedicate more space to that feature if you leave part of the drive un-formatted, but most consumer drives have at least 10%-20% extra blocks. Enterprise drives may have 50-100% more than the listed capacity. Until that threshold is reached there is zero chance of a corruption or failure related to the physical hardware.\nIn Ubuntu, you can get a report with:\nsudo smartctl /dev/YOURDEVICEHERE -a\n\nThat will tell you something like:\n...\nAvailable Spare:                    100%\nAvailable Spare Threshold:          10%\n...\n\nAs long as you're not burning up about 5% of that or more you're just fine.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by \"documented\" or by \"dying\", but I've had several cases of running Xubuntu from USB sticks for months or more, and seeing them develop file corruption, popping up more frequent \"system problem detected\" dialogs, and even freezing up (no continuation possible other than pressing the hardware Reset button).\nThe longest-lasting one was a SanDisk Extreme 32GB, which worked for a good 1.5 years and then suddenly started showing problems after I downloaded a torrent to it - after that episode for the rest of its life it would \"hiccup\" and pause during every write operation every 3-4 seconds or so. I put up with it for a while but when that turned into more errors and freezes I gave up on it and moved back to an internal SSD.\nOther sticks I've used recently that just started showing failures this month are Samsung Bar Plus 64GB ones, it's a little harder to tell what cumulative runtime I have on them because since 2021 I had used them mostly occasionally/sporadically, not as the main \"home/media desktop\", but I switched to one of them this winter as a main OS and it hasn't been more than... 3 months before I started seeing \"system problem\" dialogs, or failing partition-related commands saying the disk is read-only (happens a lot when flash storage starts failing, whether it's USB stick or SSD).\nAnd, mind you, internal SSDs haven't done that great for me either, used with Ubuntu - I think all my SSDs so far have lasted me 1-3 years and then started to develop unacceptable errors and freezes and forced me to buy something else (didn't know you could sort of revive them by filling with 0s until very recently).\nSo I have to say I'm really surprised you don't have more reports about Ubuntu \"killing\" flash storage when used as the daily home/media OS, this has been my constant experience with Ubuntu+SSDs+Live USBs since 2012.\n", "Q: installation stuck at detecting file system I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.04.1 (i386-32 bit) dual boot with Windows 7 (home premium 64 bit).

How do I install MATLAB on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit using Software Center?\n\nA: The package called 'Matlab' in Software Center is actually just an integration package (called matlab-support). As explained in the package description (apt-cache show matlab-support):\n This package does not provide MATLAB. Instead, it configures an\n existing MATLAB installation to integrate more comfortably in\n a Debian installation.\n .\n Currently it provides /usr/bin/matlab through the alternatives\n system, offers to work around incompatibilities between the libraries\n bundled with MATLAB and system libraries, and provides a helper\n utility meant to be used by other packages to compile MEX extensions.\n .\n Install this if you would like your MATLAB installation to behave more\n like an ordinary Debian package. Other packages may depend on\n this one if they install MATLAB code, for example in order to\n compile MEX extensions.\n\nYou will need to obtain your own licensed copy of Matlab for Linux first.\n\nA: MATLAB is not free, and Linux distributions usually do not include limited demos, because of the amount of work it requires to bundle.\nIf you want to try something free and open, and MATLAB-like, try Octave or QtOctave (Octave + GUI). It uses the same dialect as MATLAB and the base math & graphs package are identical to MATLAB. It lacks in extensions however.\nIf you're in statistics, then another cool tool is IPython Notebook, found at\nhttp://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/notebook/. It's nice because you learn two in one. A good tool for math/stats and a respected and used programming language at the same time.\n", "Q: Cannot run go install on Ubuntu When I run the go install command for my custom packages on Ubuntu 14.04 I got this error:\ngo install: no install location for .go files listed on command line (GOBIN not set)\n\nHow can i set $GOBIN relative in my projects directory in [anyproject]/bin?\n\nA: In go, there is a directory with all binaries rather than one bin directory per project.\nSo let's say you want all your go binaries to be in $HOME/go/bin. Then run\nmkdir $HOME/go/bin\nGOBIN=$HOME/go/bin; export GOBIN\n\nHowever you don't need to set GOBIN if the GOROOT environment variable is set up properly. So I suggest using the instructions given in https://golang.org/doc/install\nAlso see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/-mN8R_Fx-7M where Russ Cox informs:\n\nIf GOBIN is set, that's where binaries end up.  If GOBIN is not set, then the binaries end up in a directory named 'bin' under the root of the tree where the source code lives.  For things in $GOROOT, that means\n$GOROOT/bin.  For things in in a GOPATH directory DIR, that means DIR/bin.  Note that GOPATH can have multiple directories in it\nexport GOPATH=/dir1:/dir2:/dir3\n\nIf GOBIN is not set, binaries from /dir1/src end up in /dir1/bin, binaries from /dir2/src end up in /dir2/bin, and so on (and binaries from $GOROOT/src end up in $GOROOT/bin).\n\n", "Q: Issues with firefox, localized storage, and dpkg I'm running Ubuntu 14.04, and this started after I restarted my computer. What happened originally was it wouldn't wake up so to speak after I left it idle, and logged out. It was just a black screen, which I had before, but I found a solution a while back. It was a power management thing, and it was fixed. Then I started to have some internet problems specific to only my computer. Websites would load slow, and I'd either have to refreshed one or more times, or close the tab then try again, but sometimes I'd have to disconnect then reconnect to my wifi. No one else in my house are having problems. I tried different things. One thing I tried was to turn off power management to my wireless adapter. It seemed like it helped, then another suggestion was to use WICD instead of the regular program that came with Ubuntu, but then after all of this my problems kept happening again. \nI had to hard reset my computer when it wouldn't wake up, and when I went into Firefox, everything was in basic html format. I found out that it was adblock plus somehow causing the problem, and when I disable it, it goes back to normal.

If they do exist, where can I find them?\n\nA: The +mac installers are for 64-bit only, since they deal with a problem with UEFI (only 64-bit supports UEFI now). So, there is no separate image for 32-bit. They still exist for 64-bit systems, and be located at an appropriate folder in http://cdimages.ubuntu.com, depending on the flavour. Right now, it seems only Lubuntu and the main Ubuntu images have them. This might because the only older Macs need it, and only these two flavours target them.\nWhat is different about the Mac ISO image?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 laptop and monitor problem I meet with this problem second time.

Not every time in the start (so it isn't useful to \"lock\" the browser. Someone may auto-login to a website without typing the master password), just at \"random\" time.\nI don't really care about \"locking\" my browser, I just want to protect my set of passwords from unauthorised view. How can I make firefox ask for the master password ONLY when trying to show passwords?\nChanging security.password_lifetime to a large value didn't work as a semi-solution, because it will ask again at random time if I restart firefox. I would also like to avoid using a separate password manager software.\n\nA: Finally I found a good workaround on this, using the Master Password+ Firefox Add-on.\nThis add-on provides several options, one of them being \"Block master password prompts\". In case the master password is required, the Master Password+ icon blinks, but no pop-up is shown.\nNote that the websites in which I am already logged-in continue working normally. If I explicitly try to use a saved password, then I have to click the Master Password+ to enter my master password and continue.\n\nA: \"security. ask_for_password\"    Determines when Mozilla should ask for the master password.\n\n0 (default): Only the first time it's needed.(As per your need set this value)\n1: Every time it's needed\n2: Every n minutes, where n is the value in security.password_lifetime.\n\nMy personal suggestion. Before leaving the system to some one. Press ctrl+shift+deleteand clear everything. So that it will prompt for master password again.\nOr\n\nSet browser.privatebrowsing.autostart value to TRUE\n\nFind here the Source\n\nA: If you have a master password, then Firefox will need you to input that password in order to use any of your stored passwords.  There is no way around this, because the stored passwords are actually encrypted using a key derived from the master password.\nSo it is not possible to have a master password, but set Firefox only to ask for it if you want to \"view\" the stored passwords.  It will still need to ask for it when you want to \"use\" them, too.\nWhen you describe it happening at \"random\" times, it is probably happening when you first visit a website for which you have a stored password.  If you are logging in to some websites without it asking for your master password, it will be because that website has made your login persistent (eg using cookies) negating the need to show a login form on that website.  Or it will be because the browser has already asked you for your master password recently, so it has no need to ask again.\nWhat you can do is ensure that it will only ask you for the master password once per browser session, which is controlled by the config setting security.ask_for_password as mentioned elsewhere (set it to 0).\nOr, you can disable the master password.  Your passwords will still not be shown visibly by default when you are using them, only when you go in and view them in the password manager.  There is nothing wrong with finding the right balance between security and convenience for you - if you are annoyed by needing to put in your master password too much, and don't mind if Firefox can use your saved passwords without it, then a master password is not for you.  Unfortunately it won't then be able to make the passwords invisible to users of your browser, though.\n\nA: \"How can I make firefox ask for the master password ONLY when trying to show passwords?\"\nUncheck the box \"Ask to save logins and passwords for web sites\" in Firefox settings, while leaving the box \"Use a master password\" checked.\nSee https://superuser.com/questions/1233346/using-master-password-without-prompt-popup-in-firefox/1441086#1441086\n\nA: On my (Kubuntu) system, having Firefox automatically sync with my other devices--an option in preferences--caused the \"Password Required\" pop-up to pop whenever Firefox was started.  Not using Sync allows me to retain my Master Password without having to respond to the pop-up on every start.\n", "Q: Cannot upgrade kernel 3.16 from 14.04 to 14.04.2 anyony knows what may cause this error?\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic\nReading package lists...

The bugs are often quite different and I am not able to understand them. \nDmesg output: http://pastebin.com/FFFRJPVS\nI think this might be the interesting part: http://pastebin.com/pRrHUZQT\nDo you think my hardware is damaged?\n\nA: It certainly looks like a hardware problem, but not necessarily a damaged disk. Turn your notebook upside down, unscrew the lid of the disk compartment and see if the disk is pressed firmly against the connector. This may help. And do make backups.\n", "Q: Searching a application name returns \"sorry no match\" in Ubuntu 14.04 All was working well in my Ubuntu 14.04. Suddenly I couldnt search any apps through search (by pressing super key). \nI used to type \"Terminal\" or \"System Monitor\" and it would display those apps. But now, when I typed \"Terminal\" and any other apps like Chromium, it displays \"sorry no match found\". How to resolve this?\nI can open System Monitor by pressing Alt + F2 and using the command gnome-system-monitor.\n\nA: Accidentally changed settings?\nIt could be that you accidentally changed the default search settings in Dash. I would check two things first:\n\n\n*\n\n*run:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Lenses home-lens-default-view\n\nThis should return a list, in which applications should appear, like:\n['applications.scope', 'files.scope']\n\nIf not, you can set it to default by the command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Lenses home-lens-default-view \"['applications.scope', 'files.scope']\"\n\n\n*The applications Lens might be disabled for some reason, to check:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Lenses disabled-scopes\n\nIt should return:\n@as [] \n\nIf not, reset it by:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Lenses disabled-scopes \"[]\"\n\nIf that doesn't work\nIf all fails, as an alternative, you can reset the Unity configuration as described here:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need Unity Tweak Tool:\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\n\n*Run the command:\nunity-tweak-tool --reset-unity\n\n", "Q: cannot transfer binary files to mbed controller NXP LPC1768 connected via USB I have version 14.04 LTS and Windows vista on an ACER aspire \nI compile and download a binary file from the mbed site.

I also disabled UEFI SecureBoot and tried to install ubuntu. First I had a problem with the grub download and then I tried to format my partitions in the UI. I beleave that then did I make some serious mistake which resulted in the error. Also I used an usb stick formated with the universal usb installer from pendrivelinux.\nNow if I try to boot following error occurs:\n\"Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS unable to mount root fs on unknown block (2,0). \nI don't really care about dual booting anymore, I am just happy if ubuntu could start working.\n\nA: since Windows 8 is not on your plans (and from what I could read in your question, I think it is not working anymore), only Ubuntu, my suggestions for your specific hardware which I also happen to have are the following taking into consideration that you have made a backup of everything you need from the hard drive and that Windows 8 does not matter. So with this in mind, we can continue (This was the last resort I had to do with this specific laptop):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the BIOS / UEFI Settings and disable SecureBoot, UEFI and set the BIOS to be legacy mode. Ubuntu can still be installed with SecureBoot/UEFI enabled but we are simplifying the whole chaotic installation procedure here. Also check any additional settings and make sure they are on default (Like avoiding tuning anything).\n\n*Insert the Ubuntu Live USB (Does not matter if it was made with pendrivelinux, USB Creator or anything else, if it boots and it gets to the Ubuntu Live USB Desktop then you are OK. Also, when booting the USB, select the MemTest option to check for memory problems.\n\n*When the Ubuntu Live USB Desktop appears (By simply selecting \"Try Ubuntu before installing\"), open Dash and run GPARTED. We are going to go all the way with the hard drive.\n\n*When GPARTED opens, delete the whole drive. Simply delete it. Remove all partitions and make sure we are starting from scratch. After everything is deleted and GPARTED says everything is OK, close GPARTED and open the Ubuntu installer.\n\n*Follow the whole Ubuntu installing procedure (Your option to choose either automatic partitioning or doing it manually)\nIt should work now without any problems. Let me know how it went please.\n", "Q: Sending data using HTTP GET request to Ubuntu server in TCP I am using an industrial modem (Erco & Gener) to send data to a php webpage hosted on an ubuntu server. On the Ubuntu server side, my webpage answer correctly to an http request through URL of the following format:\nhttp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80/testercogener.php?id=i&time=t\n\nWhen I check the database on the ubuntu server, in the mysql database tool everything looks ok, I get my new row.\nOn the modem, I connect to the server using a TCP protocol on the GPRS network.\nMy sent data is of the form :\n\"GET /testercogener.php?id=%i&t=%t HTTP/1.1\\\\r\\\\nHost:xx.xxx.xxx.xxx\\\\r\\\\nConnection:close\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\",\"H\"\n\nfollowing the recommendations of Erco & Gener for the syntax (double \\\\ for \\).

The access log lists not only the IP address, the timestamp, and the actual request, but also the user agent. This may give an indication of where the requests are coming from, if the IP address doesn't narrow it down enough. Also, a 408 error means that the client has initiated a connection to the server, but hasn't actually sent a request within a reasonable time. It's hard to tell where the timed-out connections originate. If the error.log doesn't give any more cues, you could run a tcpdump on the server to see what other traffic runs between server and client. In any case the server does not deny the connection. The TCP system allows the \"three-way handshake\" of which the web server is notified, but after that, nothing happens. \nThe client should close the request with an empty line. That signals to the server that the request is complete and that the server can begin responding. The Connection: close header signals to the server that it can close the connection (at the TCP level). Otherwise the connection will just time out. The Connection header is optional.\n", "Q: Driver for hp laserjet p1108 printer I have an HP laserjet p1108 printer. Please send me a driver software for the same.

You can download it here. It supports thousands of HP printer models, including the p1108. After downloading the file, make it executable (right-click in the File manager) and then run it.\n", "Q: How do I remove a non-present drive from the list?

My Windows just recently died and now I want to copy all the files from the C: drive to my external HDD. And you might be wondering why all files? Because I'm afraid I might forget something in the copying process. Of course I don't need Program Files folders and Windows folder, because I'm certain there isn't anything important.  \nSo I was thinking, would a simple CTRL+A, and CTRL+C & CTRL+V would be fine?\nWould it be better to do this via terminal?\nDoes Ubuntu care about hidden files, Windows specific system files?\nHow would I verify that ALL files got copied without a problem?\n\nA: I would suggest you use the rsync command to do this. Copy-pasting is not useful in case your operation fails and you need to resume at some point. Moreover, rsync can tell you what it is doing. The command would be rsync -azv --progress /old-location /new-location. If the rsync command fails for some reason, just repeat the command. Rsync will happily move all files, including hidden files. If the rsync command (after a repeat) no longer copies anything, you can be certain that all files have been copied. Only filenames with special characters (like é or ñ) may in some cases be modified.\n", "Q: Full screen mode in virtual box.

What I usually do is to use the mouse (yuck!) to click on those arrows to do the scrolling. How can I achieve the same behavior using the keyboard?\nNow I know we can use shortcuts to scroll through tabs by opening them, for example with Ctrl+PgUp and Ctrl+PgDn. However, this implies opening the tab and I do not want to do that. I have multiple groups of tabs with a few of them containing dozens of tabs. When I close Firefox and come back they do not load automatically. So if I'm in a tab in position 57 and want to go to a tab in position 33 by using Ctrl+PgUp and Ctrl+PgDn then all tabs in between are loaded. When I use the arrows instead the tabs do not load and the tab which has the focus is still open although it is not currently showing on the tab bar. In the end, the final tab selection would still have to be done using the mouse but it would be convenient to do the scrolling with the keyboard.\n\nA: Use Alt+ Numbers.\nFor example, Alt+1 to go to the first page, Alt+6 to go to the 6th page, etc. But this shortcut works only when less than 9 tabs are opened.\nFor managing a lot of tabs consider using Tabs Menu extension. Once it is installed you can go to menubar by pressing Alt+F10, and there will be tabs menu with the list of all opened tabs. \n\nSee here also: Makeuseof review\n\nA: Press CtrlShiftE to bring up a view of all tabs.

But I can't access any files directly through programs such as PyCharm.\nI've mounted the server to /mnt/nfs/home.\nBut the only files which are accessible are 'Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop' and 'README.txt' - both seem to be corrupt, or empty.

When you log in graphically, your home directory is decrypted automatically. This does not happen with ssh.\nYou have to run ecryptfs-mount-private AFTER logging in via ssh.\necryptfs-mount-private\ncd ~\nls\n\nYou will also have a problem is you try to use ssh keys.

Also what's the safest way to get Ubuntu deb packages?\n\nA: *\n\n*The safest way is to use Ubuntu Software Center without adding personal archives to your system. You can also download them yourself: http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and use either Ubuntu Software Center or the command dpkg to install them.\n\n*A bit less safe is downloading DEB files yourself from resources you can trust. Personal archives are safe if you install them from launchpad. You can assume those personal archives have been tested and installed and when bogus all kind of alarms to go off.\n\n*Very unsafe is to install software from random locations on the web. If a random website offers a way to install software you need to make sure that the website is safe yourself. Installing MySQL by downloading from their site is all fine but installing MySQL from a random other site... I'd be very cautious.\n\nA: deb is the extension of the Debian software package format. Debian packages are used in the Debian distribution and distributions based on Debian, such as Ubuntu and others.\nDouble click a .deb file to open it for installation in the Ubuntu Software Center. Don't install .deb files from sources that you are not sure about.\nThere are two useful command-line tools for installing .deb files in the terminal. Both of them are shown in the simulated installation form, so you can try them both without installing anything.\n\n*\n\n*apt\n cd /path/to/package.deb  \n apt install --simulate ./package.deb  \n\nThis is a simulated install that automatically does package dependency resolution, but it does not always resolve package conflicts correctly. The usefulness of this command is that it can correctly identify missing apt packages. If the simulated installation is successful, you can install the .deb file for real with sudo apt install ./package.deb\nWhen faced with a package conflict apt chooses the default repository version as it should do to prevent package management disasters later on, but the price for this sensible package management is that it does not always resolve package conflicts correctly from the standpoint of simulating a successful installation of the .deb file.\n\n\n*dpkg\n cd /path/to/package.deb  \n sudo dpkg -i --simulate package.deb  \n\nThis is also a simulated install. This form of command is sometimes more successful than sudo apt install --simulate ./package.deb at simulating a successful installation of the .deb file, but it does not provide information about missing dependencies as apt does. If the simulated installation is successful, you can install the .deb file for real with sudo dpkg -i package.deb\n\nA: Deb packages can be installed in a few ways, the most easy being through the Ubuntu Software Center. By double clicking any Deb file, by default in all supported version of Ubuntu, the Ubuntu Software Center will launch and you will have the ability to install the package. The Software Center, however, is notorious for lagging and being buggy and personally I've found it being unable to install a great number of applications that are supported for my system, leading me to the second method dpkg.\nUsing the dpkg command you can install Deb packages via the command line. This is, in my experience, the fastest and most successful way of installing Deb packages. The syntax for dpkg:\nsudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE // install a Deb package\nsudo dpkg -r PACKAGE_NAME // remove a Deb package\n\nSee also How do I install a .deb file via the command line?\nThe safest sites you can download .deb files from is a hard question to answer. You could say that all official Linux/Ubuntu sites are the most safe still I would claim that downloading Google Chrome from google.com is about as safe as it gets.\nA good recommended site, as others mentioned, is Launchpad. From there you can not only download Deb packages but also find PPAs. Installing a PPA allow you to update your software via the Software Updater or update your software via the terminal.\nWhen you download from other sources you will have to apply common knowledge. One good method of preventing you from downloading 'bad software' is to simply look for someone on, for example, Ask Ubuntu that recommends the software for a specific purpose and have been given positive response for the answer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK first usage problems?

Any way I can get ligthDM to send a complete session to my Windows? Trying to avoid using VNC ...\n\nA: SSH is a tool that is very good at some things such as forwarding single programs or, with firefox for example, ports, transferring data, running or managing remote servers.\nForwarding an entire desktop is not one of them however. It can be done mind you, but performance will be slow.\nIf you connect via ssh, you have already authenticated (logged into the system) so there is no need for lightdm. You can start a session by starting you desktop environment.\nssh -XfC -c blowfish user@server xfce4-session\n\nChange xfce4-session to the DE or WM of choice. Light weight desktops without a lot of effects are going to perform much better then Unity and/or 3d effects / transparency.\nOther options are fluxbox, openbox, lxde ...\nThat command will log in (via ssh) and start xfce on your XMing server. The options -X forwards X, -f puts ssh in the background, and -c uses compression which speeds things up somewhat. Performance is acceptable over a LAN for example (although slower then FreeNX or spice).\nsee man ssh or http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/SSH_overview#Options\nOptions to improve performance over ssh are to run a panel rather then the entire desktop. You can then start applications graphically if you wish.\nYou can also use a color, rather then an image, for the background. If you use an image, ssh has to constantly re-send the information when you move windows for example.\nIf you wish to use a desktop, use a \"modern\" VNC server. FreeNX is cross platform and is both secure and fast. FreeNX (NomachineNX) is, for example, fast enough to stream music over \"the internet\" while running a desktop.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NomachineNX\nOther potential options include using a web based application to manage your server such as webmin (there are other specialized interfaces) or a web based connection (several web services are available for example - http://showmypc.com/\nIf you are using virtual machines, spice is a cross platform server/client that is also quite fast.\n", "Q: Solaar loses permissions after reboot - need to unplug Unifying receiver each time I just installed Solaar to use with my Logitech K520.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Solar 0.9.2\nEach time I reboot, I must unplug and replug the receiver, and then turn off and on the keyboard.

If it is allowed, how does the dbus differentiates between the objects (nodes) between the services.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: As I understand it, there is one connection to the daemon per process instance, and each instance will get its own unique ID.

It is a GUI tool that allows you to change several options of GRUB, like boot menu entry order/names/sub-entries, default boot entry, time it shows up, background color or image, font face and color, etc...\nTo install, you run the following commands (one by one):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\n\n# next command updates your current software (not necessary, but recommended):\nsudo apt-get upgrade    \n\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nTo run it, go to the dash and type grub and click the following icon:\n\n", "Q: How can I make coinprice-indicator open from startup?

This can happen if the cable in your system that is attached to the hard disk is faulty or is not connected firmly. If you open BIOS and the hard disk is detected this is NOT the cause.\n\n*Your boot order has a boot order where \"network\" comes before \"hard drive\". The item you want to boot off should to be the 1st in the line of boot options. (you could put the DVD 1st but it will take a bit of time for the system to skip booting from it and picking the next option). In general it is best to put the hard disk 1st and change the boot order when you need another option (like when installing from DVD/USB). \n", "Q: How to install \"plymouth-greeter\"?

I have successfully compiled the sample codes that come with CUDA and they have been running perfectly. But today I did an auto update and after that Unity Desktop was running blank after login. I tried all suggestions given in the below post and it did not help me get back my desktop:\nUbuntu Desktop does not load\nI also tried un-installing and re-installing lightdm, Ubuntu desktop, etc.... but nothing seems to work.\nMost of the posts ask to purge everything related to NVIDIA and then reinstall NVIDIA driver again. Now for someone running CUDA it is my understanding that doing a purge on nvidia-* will remove the Nvidia driver as well as the CUDA installation, which would mean reinstalling everything all over again which is highly undesirable.\nI have somehow managed to work around it by uninstalling the NVIDIA 346.35 driver and then reinstalling it again. But I am having to do this every time I update Ubuntu, which is again not handy at all. Can someone suggest a better solution which does not involve tinkering with the NVIDIA drivers or my CUDA installation?\nTo just unistall NVIDIA driver, I dropped to command console on login window by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 and ran the below command:\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.35.run --uninstall\n\nAfter it uninstalls run again:\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.35.run\n\nrestart.

Have a look here for more background information.\nSo you're stuck with manual updates of your .run file ad infinitum.\nThere is however another way to get the NVidia 346.35 on your system and that is to install the xorg.edgers PPA.  As the xorg.edgers group ask not to give installation instructions directly without linking to their page, this is the best I can do for now…\nIf you don't know what a PPA is or need some guidance about rolling forward and backward of driver versions after reading their page, leave a comment below.\n", "Q: How to change Tomboy's spell checking language I am using Tomboy 1.15.4 on Ubuntu 14.04.

After you do exit it will reboot and you can use both to login.\nAfter you use username and passsword to log in to the system you will see a prompt ($) where you can type commands to install services you want to use on your system.\nBy the way: if you want an EASIER life I would suggest installing a DESKTOP version. Ubuntu does not use a different system for server and desktop anymore; the desktop will have you suffer a bit of a performance hit but the graphical tools you can use make up for it bigtime. You can use tasksel below to install a desktop or just type sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop or any of the other desktops. \nIf you want to use the system to host a website you would install a lamp-server with:\nsudo apt-get install lamp-server^\n\nThat will install and configure apache, mysql and php. \"sudo\" will ask for your password by the way. \nIf you want to install just MySQL so you can use a database ...\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nThere are similar services for a mailserver, fileserver. If you want an overview of these services install tasksel with \nsudo apt-get install tasksel\n\nand type tasksel on command line.

Get to tty console, make sure you are connected (or connect with nmcli ). Install alternate desktop manager aka greeter. Examples:\nsudo apt-get install gdm\nsudo apt-get install lightdm-gtk-greeter\nsudo apt-get install lightdm-webkit-greeter\nNote: if you are getting gdm, you will be prompted to choose default greeter upon installation, chose gdm; if you're getting lightdm type of greeter, you may want to specify that in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file; for example:\n\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\n2) Check permissions of your home folder:\nIn the example of this user, his home folder permissions were modified to be viewed only by him alone, and prevented the desktop manager from accessing relevant data. Get to the terminal and do ls -dl /home/yourusername. If you have permission set as -rw-------, you may want to do sudo chmod 755 /home/yourusername\n3) Abandon the old username and reclaim the home folder\nChange ownership first: chown -hR yournewusername:yournewgroup /home/youroldusername\nThen copy the files into your new folder: rsync -r /home/oldusername /home/newusername/oldfiles\nNote that if you have lots of data there, it might take a while, so don't freak out if rsync seems to hang; just let it finish doing its job first.\n", "Q: How to restore a damaged touchpad?

But not this time!\nThis appears to be an issue with 14.04.2 and the included Broadcom driver (never a good thing to hear), and for me, it happened to be this exact issue reported on Launchpad:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bcmwl/+bug/1307744\nThat bug report states a fix was released 9 months ago for this, but for some reason it didn't make it into the 14.04.2 release. The issue didn't affect 14.04.1 since it was still using the 3.13 kernel.\nHappily, I was able to fix it easily, by just installing the bcmwl-kernel-source package from Ubuntu 14.10 \"Utopic\", rather than doing the code editing and compiling that is discussed in the bug report.\nYou can download the bcmwl package for Utopic from here:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/bcmwl-kernel-source\nGet the amd64 one if you are using 64-bit, or i386 for 32-bit. Just download it and double-click it - Ubuntu Software Centre will pop up and ask if you want to install it. Hopefully, if your problem is the same as mine, that will automatically install the module, add the wireless interface and get you online without having to tether to your phone.\nMatt\n\nA: Matt's solution did the trick, but after reboot my WiFi interface disappeared again and i had to reinstall package each time, then using modprobe to get it working. So i post here a list of actions i did to get my wifi card working.\nFirstly remove packages\nsudo apt-get remove bcmwl-kernel-source firmware-b43-installer b43-fwcutter\n\nNow download and install bcmwl-kernel-source with bug fixed: \ncd ~/Desktop\nwget http://ubuntu.mirrors.tds.net/ubuntu/pool/restricted/b/bcmwl/bcmwl-kernel-source_6.30.223.248+bdcom-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb -O bcmwl.deb\nsudo apt-get install dkms\nsudo dpkg -i bcmwl.deb\n\nNow turn on the driver. If WiFi will not appear (wlan0 at iwconfig) then something is wrong (try next step and try again modprobes). This appear to work only after bcmwl.deb installation.\nsudo modprobe -r b43 ssb wl\nsudo modprobe wl\n\nTo fix the boot configuration, i had to edit modprobe's blacklist configuration:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nI post blacklist directives which are required, and commented directives are NOT required for WiFi fix:\n#blacklist bcm43xx\nblacklist brcmsmac\nblacklist bcma\n\n# unsure\nblacklist ssb\n\nAnd finally i had to disable kernel module brcmsmac:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modules\n\nEnsure there is no brcmsmac mentioning or it is a comment.\n#brcmsmac\n\nDone, now i can safely reboot with WiFi interface working.\n\nA: You shouldn't have to install the package every reboot and the install of this package should blacklist b43, ssb, bcma unless they are in /etc/modules and the only reason for wl not to load is because you put it in a blacklist file\nCheck /etc/modules with cat /etc/modules and you can check blacklist files for wl with `for f in /etc/modprobe.d/*; do echo $f; cat $f | grep wl; done\n", "Q: Is it possible to prevent a file from being deleted unless in safe mode? Is it possible to make a file only deletable when in safe mode on linux? Specifically I am using ubuntu 14.04 and I need to prevent a file from being deleted.\nIf this solution is not possible is there another way where it would be difficult for Sudoer's to remove the file?\nThe only solution I know of is using chattr +i/-i and it is too easy to remove.\n\nA: No. The problem you have is that if an admin would not be able to remove a file it would introduce a security risk: someone with malicious intent and access to the system would then be able to install a file on your system even the admin of that system could not remove. A disgruntled admin could have some real fun with that...\nBesides attr (that can be easily changed by an admin) you can also start the file with a dot making it invisible for normal commands (ls would need the -a option) making it harder for uneducated people to find and delete it (It will not fool someone who knows that there is a secret file present on the system). Nothing that can prevent deleting the file. \nBut ...\nOne method that will work though is to mount the file on a read only encrypted partition. The encryption is needed so \"root\" can not remount it without knowing the password. Someone could still remove the file when that person is able to remount it writeable and it has no relation to the \"only in safe mode\" part of your question though. But this seems to be the most practical approach. \nUbuntu also supports encrypted private directories (package ecrypt-utils but there are similar tools like cryptkeeper). But it depends if you need the contents of the file to enforce something or if it is actually the deleting of it that is a concern. To use the file you will need to open the directory with your login and password; it is then also possible to remove the file (so when you are not behind the system you will need to unmount the private directory to prevent deleting; when you are behind the machine and need it you can mount it and unmount it when not needed; limiting the time frame someone can delete it).\n\nI do have one problem with your question: in general you really should trust an administrator to not mess with files. If you can not trust that person remove his access and restrict his account to a normal account with some extra privileges. Making sure you are the only admin is a better and a lot easier method in preventing deletion of that file. \n", "Q: Dr. Racket does not work properly I just installed Dr. Racket Version 5.3.6 on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (32 bit) machine.

But I am clever so just throw me a clue of \"where to go\" \"what to see\" and \"what to do\" and stuff.\n\nA: \nHow do I get it over and into my server to be displayed for all the world to see?\n\nAs your question has 2 parts, I will try to answer them both. Firstly, the \"How do I get it over\" part. You just need to install ssh server program on your ubuntu box and then ssh from your windows 7 by using putty. Putty is better for administrating your ubuntu server, but to transfer files winscp is better with a nice GUI and drag&drop operation. It's basically windows version of linux program called 'scp' (Secure CoPy). Either way, you will need ssh. \nTo install ssh, execute the following commands.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nAnd to be able to open localhost on your browser, you need to install apache, or any other software for that matter. \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\nNow, you can have the HTML/CSS documents on the ubuntu server. And you can view the \"It works!\" page on localhost with browser. \n\"To be displayed for all the world to see?\" As for this part of the question, I can only give you a brief guide, as I don't have experience on web development. You will need to buy a domain name (or get a free one), and hosting space (or you can use your ubuntu box as server). Here's a basic tutorial from digitalocean. You can get more information by searching on google. \n\nA: You install SSH. \nsudo apt-get install ssh\n\nThen you use it for administering the server from your Windows box (one popular SSH client is PuTTY), as well as for transferring files to and from via SFTP (not FTP). One SFTP client that I have used is FileZilla, there are many others.\n", "Q: Stuck on login screen, everything plugged in is unresponsive Whilst downloading version 14.04, my mother manually restarted the computer by holding the power button in.

When I rip a CD to mp3 using Sound Juicer I get just broken mp3 files. I like to rip VBR files, they look fine, but the  reported bitrate is always 32kbit/s. See:\nmp3check -a 01.\\ Anita.mp3 \n01. Anita.mp3:\nanomaly: bitrate  32 kbit/s\nanomaly: no crc\n\nI expect that the reported were the average bit rate value. When I put these files in a mp3 player, the reported track duration time is always wrong. The player expects a hour long music file when it has just a couple of minutes. \nIt used to work fine, but it silently broke in an update some time ago. Unfortunately I can not find how to correctly configure it. My Ubuntu is version 14.04.1.\nI’ve tried these approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run gconf-editor, go to apps → sound-juicer, and put the value described here in the pipeline attribute.

You can rip and choose bitrate (vbr) and encode your files to any .ogg,.mp3,.flacetc. And the choice is after you of course.\n\nSo, we need to install K3b:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nsudo apt-get install k3b\n\nNow we'll need some additional packages to work with audio:\nsudo apt-get install libk3b6-extracodecs\n\nsudo apt-get install kde-config-cddb\n\nAnd at last we'll need some more codecs to encode .mp3 and .flac:\nsudo apt-get install lame\n\nsudo apt-get install flac\n\nDone. Now you'll get plenty enough options to rip (audio cd) with.\n\nA: Unfortunately the version of sound-juicer that you are using suffers from a bug in gstreamer which means that the xing header is not written to mp3 files. Without this header most software will report incorrect track lengths and bitrates. It is possible to use vbrfix to fix the files you have ripped. As others have pointed out there is a work around for this bug in later versions of sound-juicer.\nI'm currently working on a feature to allow users to change the encoding bitrate, this should be available in sound-juicer 3.18 which will be released in September. In the mean time you can follow progress on the bug which you linked to, or if you're feeling brave try compiling the wip/encoding-presets branch (Once the UI is done that will require GTK 3.12 which means Ubuntu 14.10 or later I think or you can try using jhbuild to build the necessary dependencies)\n", "Q: Zcache Usage in Lubuntu Recently I appended zcache to my grub configuration:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash zcache\"\n\nBut I am at a loss as to whether zcache is working or if I need to do something else.

Is it safe to simply change the python3 link?\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.4m /usr/bin/python3\n\nAre there system components that would die due to an inability to work with python3.4 instead of python3.2?\n\nA: If you do that\n\n\n*\n\n*python3.4 will not find modules installed in places like /usr/lib/python3.2/. That includes all modules installed by the package manager.\n\n*modules containing binary libs compiles against Python 2.3 will likely not work without recompiling. \n\n\nThat means that almost all programs from the official repositories needing Python3 will stop working.\n", "Q: How do I check whether a module is installed in Python, and install it if needed? In terminal, after I start Python, how will I know what are the modules present in python?\nSuppose I need to learn the modules NumPy and SciPy.\n\n\n*\n\n*How will I install it if it is not installed? \n\n*How will I know if it is already installed?\n\n\nA: To provide another answer, for completion's sake:\nYou can (ab)use the -m option. From Python's manpage:\n   -m module-name\n          Searches sys.path for the named module and runs the  correspond‐\n          ing .py file as a script.\n\nWhich will give us:\n$ python2 -m numpy\n/sbin/python2: No module named numpy.__main__; 'numpy' is a package and cannot be directly executed\n\n$ python2 -m math\n/sbin/python2: No code object available for math\n\nBut for non-existent modules, it will give us:\n$ python2 -m doesnt_exist\n/sbin/python2: No module named doesnt_exist\n\nWe could use grep to match for this:\n$ python2 -m doesnt_exist |& grep -q 'No module named' && echo 'Nope' || echo 'Yup'\nNope\n\n$ python2 -m math |& grep -q 'No module named' && echo 'Nope' || echo 'Yup'\nYup\n\nThis is slightly hack-ish, and not what -m was intended for; but it is the\nmethod that requires the least typing if you want a quick test :-)\n\nA: I wrote an example in Python:\nimport pip\nimport sys\nfrom bigml.api import BigML\n\n\nif not 'bigml' in sys.modules.keys():\n    pip.main(['install', 'bigml'])\n\n\nA: Shell oneliner check (useful for provisioning)\nI found that in order to make my infrastructure provisioning** idempotent, I need to be able to check for a package from the shell in a oneliner. I built on @cuonglm's answer. I had to reverse the 1 and 0 because I'm producing an exit status rather than printing a string.\npython -c \"import sys, pkgutil; sys.exit(0 if pkgutil.find_loader(sys.argv[1]) else 1)\" pymongo\n\nYou could replace the sys.argv[1] with the single quoted name of your package, but for my provisioning scripts I like the readability of having it at the end.\npython -c \"import sys, pkgutil; sys.exit(0 if pkgutil.find_loader('pymongo') else 1)\"\n\n** I realize that chef, puppet, and ansible all have plugins for managing python packages, but you may find yourself in a situation like me where you are using an outdated version and don't want to use deprecated plugins.\n\nA: In case we do not want to unwantedly import a module in question (which would happen in  a try statement) we can make use of sys.modules to test modules that are installed and were imported before.\nIn the python shell issue:\n>>> import sys\n\nThen test for installed modules:\n>>> 'numpy' in sys.modules\nTrue\n>>> 'scipy' in sys.modules\nFalse\n\nNote that only those modules that were imported before give True on this test, all other modules (even if installed) result in False.\nAnother alternative to try an import statement in the python console is calling the inbuilt help() function. This will not give a documentation for non-installed modules, e.g.\n>>> help('scipy')\nno Python documentation found for 'scipy'\n\nThe output of very long help documents of installed modules can be interrupted with Q.\nNow to install missing modules it is recommended to use the Ubuntu package management (and not the Python pip way) because we need root access and also to prevent messing up our heavily Python-dependend system. For the module in question this would e.g. be:\nsudo apt-get install python-scipy ## for Python2\nsudo apt-get install python3-scipy ## for Python3\n\nAfter installation we then can add them to the sys.modules dictionary by importing them once.\n\nA: Another way is the pkgutil module. Works with both Python 2 & 3:\npython -c 'import pkgutil; print(1 if pkgutil.find_loader(\"module\") else 0)'\n\nYou need to replace module with the name of your module, example:\n$ python -c 'import pkgutil; print(1 if pkgutil.find_loader(\"math\") else 0)'\n1\n\n\nA: I know the OP originally asked for a solution after starting Python, but outside of python I use pip. On ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-pip, if it's not already installed.\nThen to see what third party modules are available, just run:\npip freeze\n\nOr even\npip list\n\nAnd both will show you all modules installed and their versions.\nIf the module you're looking for is not installed, most of the time you can easily install it with pip:\npip install <module-name>\n\n\nIf you're not sure of whether a module exists or what its PyPI name is, use `pip search`:\npip search <keyword>\n\n\nIt appears that pip search no longer functions. (See @AJM's comment below). I tend to use Pypi's search directly\n\nA: You could put the code inside try, except block.\n$ python3 -c \"\\\ntry:\n    import cow  \n    print('\\nModule was installed')\nexcept ImportError:\n    print('\\nThere was no such module installed')\"\n\nThere was no such module installed\n\n\n$ python3 -c \"\\\ntry:\n    import regex\n    print('\\nModule was installed')\nexcept ImportError:\n    print('\\nThere was no such module installed')\"\n\nModule was installed\n\n\nA: How to know if a python module is installed or not in the system: You can do a very easy test in terminal,\n$ python -c \"import math\"\n$ echo $?\n0                                # math module exists in system\n\n$ python -c \"import numpy\"\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named numpy\n$ echo $?\n1                                # numpy module does not exist in system\n\nHow will I install it if it is not installed\nYou can install specific module by downloading respective packages from repository, for example you can install scipy as,\nsudo apt-get install python-scipy ## for Python2\nsudo apt-get install python3-scipy ## for Python3\n\nAlternately You can also install a python module using python-pip as suggested by Zack Titan in the comment below, To install numpy you can use\npip install numpy\n\nWarning: It is highly recommended to install python-modules using official Ubuntu repository only and not to use the pip method as superuser(i.e., as root or using sudo). In some cases it may leave your system unusable by breaking system python. \nHow to install packages using pip into local virtual environment.\n\nA: One can also use pydoc modules, which can be filtered with grep to find a specific module. The output is displayed in columnated format. The only disadvantage of this approach is that it also will include python files in the current working directory.

This computer doesn't have any problem when installing ubuntu into internal SSD. But when I install the ubuntu 14.04.2 on an external USB 3 HDD (it is a SATA3 to USB3 HDD adapter with ASMedia chipset), and then perform a system suspend, the system suspends successfully. But if I wake up the system, the system wakes up successfully, but dmesg has a lot of I/O errors, and I can't load or save anything into my root partition (/), for example, when I try to save the output of dmesg to my home directory (which resides in my root partition), the command hangs and displays a lot of I/O error.\nHow do I enable the system to suspend correctly when I boot from the external HDD? Thank you for the asistance in advance.\n\nA: Suspending to an external HDD always works because the HDD is available when suspending.  Resuming depends on your BIOS to \"wake up\" devices in the correct order, so the only option you have is to upgrade your BIOS or to turn off suspension.\nI got rid of this by installing the X screen saver and turning off suspend in system settings as in this answer: 12.04-Laptop freezes everytime I close my lid\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Chromebook: (precise) \"myusername\"@localhost: what is precise?

How do I get rid of the word precise?\nAnd what is localhost? I used to have something like this: \nmyusername@myusername:~$   \n\nCan I change this also?\n\nA: The (precise) indicates that you're running inside a chroot, not inside a normal Ubuntu installation. (Are you using Crouton?) To remove it, edit ~/.bashrc, find the following lines:\nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\nelse\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\nfi\n\nComment them out by adding a # at the beginning of each line.\nThe localhost part is the hostname of your chroot.

When you create a file, an inode is generated for that file to keep the metadata. So, no matter how big or small the file is one file will result in one associated inode. \nBy the size of the actual disk space free i am guessing that you may have many small files of minimum disk space (4K for ext FS). So the solution would be to remove the unnecessary files to free up inodes and then you are good to go. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - Strange problem - browsing makes screen go black!

That path can ve investigated with which conda.\n\nA: If you are getting a CondaIOError with conda command, it means that the conda directory does not have enough permissions to download and save new libraries.\nJust execute these commands in terminal, and you'll be good to go:\nsudo chown -R username /home/username/path-to-conda-folder/\nsudo chmod -R +x /home/username/path-to-conda-folder/\nChange username and path-to-conda-folder according to your PC.\nHope this helps! :)\n\nA: You can do the following\nBefore running the sudo command type\nwhich conda\n\nthen use the full conda path\nsudo ~/install/ananconda//5.1../etc install myPackageName\n\n", "Q: Install Numpy for Python-3.4.2 using Conda on Ubuntu 14.04.01 LTS I installed conda properly.\nNow I want to use Numpy along with the Python-3.4.2 that comes by default with it.\nHere is what I run and what I got as an error:\n conda install python3-numpy\nFetching package metadata: ....\nError: No packages found in current linux-32 channels matching: python3-numpy\n\nDid you mean one of these?\n\n    python-ntlm\n\nYou can search for this package on Binstar with\n\n    binstar search -t conda python3-numpy\nbegueradj@begueradj-HP-Compaq-6510b-KE130ET-ABF:/home$ binstar search -t conda python3-numpy\nUsing binstar api site https://api.binstar.org\nRun 'binstar show <USER/PACKAGE>' to get more details:\nNo packages found\n     Name                      |  Version | Package Types   | Platforms      \n     ------------------------- |   ------ | --------------- | ---------------\nFound 0 packages\n\nHow can I resolve this problem ?\n\nA: In conda, the package is just called numpy.

So i created a Launcher shortcut on the left with command sudo gedit.\nSo every time i click the icon on the left Launcher, gedit will started as root. But the problem is that, when i modified other files, such as files in /home, the owner of file will also be changed to root. I don't want to do this, i just want to save this file without modifying its owner, and i don't want to bother every time to restart gedit as root to modify files owned by root. How to do it?\n\nA: Add a shortcut to your launcher.\nI would not change the main command of the gedit launcher. Do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Never edit the default launcher, first copy the one from /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications:\ncp /usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/gedit.desktop\n\n\n*Edit the file with... gedit (not with gksudo)\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/gedit.desktop\n\nLook for the line, starting with Actions=, Add gedit with gksu;:\nActions=Window;Document;gedit with gksu;\n\n\n*To the very end of the file add the shortcut section:\n[Desktop Action gedit with gksu]\nName=gedit with gksu\nExec=gksu gedit\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n\n*Done, Now if you click on the icon, gedit starts \"normally\", while you have gksu gedit available as a shortcut:\n\n\n\nDirectly browse for a file to edit\nIf you often edit files with gksu with gedit, you can also directly call a (Zenity) browser from the launcher, to open your files with gksu. You can \"save\" one step when opening files with gksu then:\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy & open the local .desktop file as in the first option\n\n*Look for the line, starting with Actions=, Add gksu gedit with filebrowser;:\nActions=Window;Document;gksu gedit with filebrowser;\n\n\n*At the very end of the file, add the shortcut section:\n[Desktop Action gksu gedit with filebrowser]\nName=gksu gedit with filebrowser\nExec=sh -c \"gksu gedit $(zenity --file-selection --title='Select a file')\"\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nNote\ngksu is not installed by default, you will probably have to install it if you use the commands mentioned:\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\n\nA: You can modify the owner by opening a terminal up and typing in `chown user /path/to/file  like Byte Commander stated you can do this.  However, setting the the owner isnt enough.  because you're accessing a root placed file in a root only access folder.  You need to give your self full permissions.\nTo make your self like root for that file only you need to type in a terminal\nchmod u+aw filenamewithextension\n\nYou must do this while being in the file's location.\nAfter this, you can gedit without sudo and never have the system modify the owner.  Do not sudo gedit or it will!\n", "Q: Bulk image download from piwigo-based web gallery I wish to download original sized images from this website, built upon piwigo CM http://mermaid.pink/\nSingle image download is allowed, but that would take ages.\nIs there an application, extension, script or anything else capable of this task?\n\nA: You can use wget as shown here:\n\nDownloading an Entire Web Site with wget\nSep 05, 2008  By Dashamir Hoxha  in HOW-TOs\nIf you ever need to download an entire Web site, perhaps for off-line\n  viewing, wget can do the job—for example:\n$ wget \\\n     --recursive \\\n     --no-clobber \\\n     --page-requisites \\\n     --html-extension \\\n     --convert-links \\\n     --restrict-file-names=windows \\\n     --domains website.org \\\n     --no-parent \\\n         www.website.org/tutorials/html/\n\nThis command downloads the Web site\n  http://www.website.org/tutorials/html/.\nThe options are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*--recursive: download the entire Web site.\n  \n*--domains website.org: don't follow links outside website.org.\n  \n*--no-parent: don't follow links outside the directory tutorials/html/.\n  \n*--page-requisites: get all the elements that compose the page (images, CSS and so on).\n  \n*--html-extension: save files with the .html extension.\n  \n*--convert-links: convert links so that they work locally, off-line.\n  \n*--restrict-file-names=windows: modify filenames so that they will work in Windows as well.\n  \n*--no-clobber: don't overwrite any existing files (used in case the download is interrupted and resumed).\n  \n\nOut of these --page-requisites & --recursive will likely be needed, though --convert-links or --no-clobber may be useful.

The default maximum depth is 5.\n\n\n*-l depth | --level=depth:\n\n\n*\n\n*Specify recursion maximum depth level depth.\n\n\n*-nd | --no-directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving\n   recursively.  With this option turned on, all files will get saved\n   to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up\n   more than once, the filenames will get extensions .n).\n\n\n*-H | --span-hosts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving.\n\n\n*-p | --page-requisites:\n\n\n*\n\n*This option causes Wget to download all the files that are\n   necessary to properly display a given HTML page.

Note that if any of the wildcard characters, ,\n   ?, [ or ], appear in an element of acclist , it will be\n   treated as a pattern, rather than a suffix.  In this case, you have\n   to enclose the pattern into quotes to prevent your shell from\n   expanding it, like in -A \".mp3\" or -A '*.mp3'.\n\n\n*-e | --execute:\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute command as if it were a part of .wgetrc.

I have found some question about How to use TV-tuner? but I do not find any solution. I am very new to ubuntu.\n\nA: I have tried hard to work this TV-tuner with Ubuntu but with no luck.As working with a unsupported hardware in Linux is very difficult.So to use this TV-tuner you should have dual boot with Windows.But if I ever found a work-around I'll let you know.\n", "Q: No sound in Ubuntu 14.04 after HDMI detatch I was using my TV as a monitor connected to my lenovo laptop, through a HDMI connection, manually changing the sound sink in system options. Then I shutdown the system and then unplugged the HDMI, when for the next time I started Ubuntu, the sound dissapeared. The sound is not present only on my user profile (on the Guest is everything ok). I belive that the system somehow 'forgot' to reset to the internal speakers of my laptop.\nI've tried solutions with writing a /etc/defaults/sound.conf, or using alsamixer or even re-installing the alsa-base pulseaudio. Nothing helped.\nDoes anyone have a clue?\n\nA: That was not the whole problem as I see now. You see, after the re-installation of the alsa drivers, there was no 'sound indicator' in the system tray. I tried to access system options but... there were only some of them, like here. I needed to re-install the unity-control-center and that did the trick. Finally, \n\nWelcome to Ask Ubuntu! ;-) Could you please try to connect the TV again, System settings - sound, set it to internal speakers, disconnect TV. Please let us know if this helps... –  Fabby \n\nYeah, that was the final part, which did the trick.

I've  tried three other posts about how to install drivers for   \n\n\n*\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430\n\n*Video Drivers for Onboard GeForce 6150SE\n\n*Nvidia geforce 6150-unity 3d won't work\nThe problem is I've tried installing all the drivers suggested, one by one, test them, remove them, install another and until now the one which is working best is nouveau, but It also freezes the screen on random actions, most notably when I start Firefox.\nIf you have this card installed and working well please tell us what driver/distribution/configuration you are using. Thank you.\nXorg.0.log file: http://pastebin.com/8HLG59y7\nsyslog tells me this:\nFeb 23 11:55:19 xxxxxxx kernel: [   48.418101] systemd-logind[1202]: Failed to start unit user@1000.service: Unknown unit: user@1000.service\nFeb 23 13:22:30 xxxxxx kernel: [ 5286.305415] nouveau E[    PBUS][0000:00:0d.0] MMIO write of 0x00000000 FAULT at 0x00b010\n\nA: I found that the correct driver (working well now for two days) is the nvidia-304 which can be installed from repositories. This might be problematic if you are making a clean install because the Geforce 6150SE will not work well when installing from the Ubuntu DVD: the Ubuntu live session will freeze, so follow this sequence:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the DVD and press Space to choose different methods of installation.\n\n*Choose Experienced Install.\n\n*Install Ubuntu.\n\n*After install is done, press CTRL+ALT+F1 and login.\n\n*Update your system:\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n*Install the driver:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-304\n\n*DO NOT run nvidia-xconfig (THIS IS IMPORTANT).\n\n*Reboot the system (just press CTRL+ALT+DEL)\n\n*Login normally.\n\n*Open Nvidia X server settings from the dash.\n\n*Backup your configuration (you can copy and paste it to a txt file)\n\n\nI hope this helps others, it's worked for me (so far).\n\nA: Correct can mean lots of things.\nThe nvidia drivers are proprietary and do not integrate well with the rest of the free software ecosystem and community.  The nouveau driver is the preferred one, but in Debian testing and unstable it has a bug with the 6150SE, which you can workaround by inserting into /etc/modprobe.d/local-video.conf:\noptions nouveau noaccel=1\n\nA: I have tried all the steps above with no results. I have tried everything. Finally Got it to work. Here's the problem with random screen freezes using any flavor of Linux with a older Nvidia graphics card, especially an integrated one like the Nvidia G force 430 series. Permanently add the Nomodeset. \nAs mention by user NikTh on Oct 27 '12 at 14:02, The newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into the kernel. So all the programming of the hardware specific clock rates and registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than in the X driver when the X server starts.. \nThis makes it possible to have high resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker free transitions from boot splash to login screen. \nUnfortunately, on some cards this doesnt work properly and you end up with a black screen or in my case black screens and random freezes when watching a youtube video when using Firefox. \nAdding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\nFor help in adding these parameters, check out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132\n\nA: I had the same experience with Linux Mint 19.0. The fix was to avoid the update to kernel 4.15 or to install Linux Mint 18.2 which works for me. I can do all of the updates and still have my video driver, Nvidia Geforce 1650 SE Nforce working.\nI wanted to dual boot with either Debian or PCLinuxOS but since those are rolling releases, the updates break the system since the X driver gets moved into the kernel. \nAnother fix would be to just buy a cheap video card. \n", "Q: Is it possible to restrict a program from reading anything outside what they need? I understand that running programs as a non-root user is done in order to restrict the programs from writing system files, which prevents malware from compromising the system security.\nBut in most cases those programs are still able to read those system files even though they cannot write them (ex. /etc/fstab) which leaves the system vulnerable to wide range of spyware.\nSo, is it possible to restrict programs in a more draconian way so that they would not be able to access anything outside a defined environment? For example, I could allow firefox to use ~/.mozilla, ~/.cache/mozilla and ~/Downloads, but firefox will never be able to read anything from /etc or such.\nIs there such a feature in Linux?\n\nA: The method to restrict access on Ubuntu is with apparmor.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor\nFirefox comes with an apparmor profile for Firefox which has been specifically developed with security in mind.\nas pointed out by Rinzwind , ro access is not necessarily a security problem.\nLarge programs such as firefox is not the best of examples as firefox has rather broad capabilities from network access to hardware access. \nAs you can see, the firefox apparmor profile is quite large. You can certainly modify the apparmor profile to your specific needs / concerns if you so desire. Just be sure to save a copy of the original profile so you can restore it if you break firefox functionality.\nOther browsers, such as chromium, run is a sandbox.\nIf you are particularly interested in security, you can run Fedora with selinux and run applications in a selinux sandbox.\napparmor profiles are available here \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/AppArmorProfiles\n\nA: Yes, there is: it is called the chroot environment (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot).\n", "Q: Change default python version in IDLE So, I'd like to have Python 2.7.6 when I open the IDLE (that is the one pre-installed on Ubuntu); instead, the idle opens with the one that I have installed (2.7.5). \nHow can I do that?\n\nA: If you need Python 2 just type idle in terminal.\nIf you need Python3 type idle3.\nI have both Python2 and Python3 installed and also idle and idle3.\n\nA: sudo nano /usr/bin/idle-python2.7\nIt looks like this\n#! /usr/bin/python2.7\n\nfrom idlelib.PyShell import main\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nChange the end of the first line to reflect your desire.\n#! /usr/bin/python2.7.6 \n\n^X  to save, and y to consent.\nGive it a whirl.\n", "Q: ClamAV detects certain files on the PlayOnLinux directory as malware, should I be concerned? ClamAv found 50 viruses on my computer, mostly associated with PlayOnLinux. Is this normal? Is it a significant risk?  Should I be concerned?  How do I learn more about these viruses so I can judge how to respond? This Pishing Viruses, are they dangerous?\n\n\nA: True, \"Linux is virus free\" is a myth. And it's also an extremely inaccurate and vague sentence. \nYou can read a lot on this topic, and there are a lot of articles explaining you what kind of \"virus\" (believe me, it's the wrong word to define such things, but let's use it for this discussion) are out there, how a \"virus\" may harm you, and how unlikely this event can be on a desktop system. \nTo start I suggest you to read Is Linux Immune to Viruses?\nActually if you: \n\n\n*\n\n*use a recent release of Ubuntu that's currently supported\n\n*install only packages from main repositories and Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*set a complex user password\n\n*keep your system constantly updated\n\n*setup ufw firewall \n\n\nthe odds that you get any harm from a \"virus\" or \"malware\" are extremely low, approaching zero.\nThe best thing you can do to protect yourself from potentially harmful \"viruses\" is to read and learn about system inner workings and security. No software can be as effective as \"security device\" as knowledge. ;-)\nAbout your experiences: since PlayOnLinux uses Wine to make Windows software run on GNU/Linux, you are able to run most of the software that can run on Microsoft Windows, even viruses. Actually they are a lot less harmful on Ubuntu than on Windows, since Wine isolate them from most of the system, but still they can do something. \nWhat ClamAV found were the exactly the same Windows viruses you could get on Windows. Maybe you got them trying to install something from untrustworthy sources, that you ought to avoid anyway. \nSo, in conclusion, it's practically true that \"Linux is virus free\", as long as you stick on the 5 points above. ;-)\n\nA: Well, that made my day! :D\nLet us see... Linux is not exactly virus free. If you let a certain malicious script run, it might install some little programs to steal your information. Though, the system is built in a way that it should warn you of a script wanting to run itself as root.\nNow.. you said the viruses were found on PlayOnLinux, which is a wine layer, which is a Windows layer itself. There you go, Windows -> Windows' executables, -> Windows viruses.\nWhat ClamAv detected are Windows' viruses and not Linux viruses.\nYou are safe.\n\nA: It's not necessarily normal to have that many viruses, but they are all usually \"Windows viruses\" meaning they run via WINE and where installed with some program using WINE. These types of viruses are usually not too dangerous as they have limitations as to what they can actually do and they are not installed on your system, just your wine prefix.\nWhat your results actually mean is that you should be more careful of what Windows programs you choose to install. WINE can run programs and it can run viruses.\n", "Q: How I can change the color of a themed box?

I'm sure it has happened and I can't live with the idea of looking through my trash folder to check if I am not going to throw away something I didn't mean to.\n\nA: No, Unity does not have a confirm delete box like windows.\nThats the reason the bin exist, so if you did make a mistake you can undo it by hitting restore.\n\nA: Nautilus does not provide a confirmation option: solution?\nThe fact that nautilus does not provide an option, does not mean that you have to take the risk to accidentally lose files if you unintentionally (and unnoticed) hit the Enter key.\nYou can simply run a script in the background, keeping an eye on delete actions, using the trash-cli -tools. If you run the script below in the background, it does two things that will prevent unnoticed deletion\n\n\n*\n\n*It notifies you whenever you move a file to trash:\n\nIf you click \"OK\", nothing happens. If you click \"Cancel\", the trash will be opened and you can restore your item, since you know the name and the original path to the file.\n\n*It keeps track of the last 50 trash actions (one per line)\nIn your Home directory, the script creates a log file, trashlog.txt, with the last 50 trash actions. This makes sure that you can track what happened, even if you accidentally hit the \"OK\" button.\n\nIt logs all trash events with a time stamp, like:\nTue Feb 24 07:30:55 2015: '/home/jacob/Naamloze map/Naamloos document (11e kopie)'\nTue Feb 24 07:31:09 2015: '/home/jacob/Naamloze map/Naamloze map'\n\nExplanation\nIn a loop, the script checks the list of deleted files with the help of trash-cli, with the command:\ntrash-list\n\nThe command lists all delete actions, also from e.g. external drives.\nWhenever new items appear in the list, the script calls a Zenity window, listing the (newly) deleted files. At the same time, these files are listed into a log file: ~/trashlog.txt. To prevent the file to become to large, it only \"remembers\" (a little more then) the last 50 delete events.\nThe Zenity window returns a \"non-zero\" when the Cancel button is pressed, and the script opens Trash (actually trash:///) to enable the user to restore the file.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses trash-cli\nsudo apt-get install trash-cli\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as trash_secure (no extension) in ~/bin. Make the directory if it does not exist yet.\n\n*Make the script executable.\n\n*Log out and back in, test-run the script from a terminal eindow with the command:\ntrash_secure\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\n\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ntrashlog = home+\"/trashlog.txt\"\n\ndef trashlist():\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"trash-list\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef log_trash(last_trashed):\n    if not os.path.exists(trashlog):\n        with open(trashlog, \"wt\") as log:\n            log.write(last_trashed)\n    else:\n        with open(trashlog, \"r\") as log:\n            log = log.readlines()\n            log = log[50:]+[last_trashed] if len(log) > 50 else log+[last_trashed]\n        with open(trashlog, \"wt\") as out:\n            for it in log:\n                out.write(it)\n            out.write(\"\\n\")\n\ntrash1 = trashlist()\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep (1)\n    trash2 = trashlist()\n    if trash2 != trash1:\n        diff = (\" \").join([\"'\"+l[l.find(\"/\"):]+\"'\" for l in trash2.splitlines() if not l in trash1])\n        log_trash(time.ctime()+\": \"+diff)\n        zenity_message = \"zenity --list --width=600 --height=200 --title='Items were trashed' --text='' --column='Path' \"+diff\n        try:\n            check = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", zenity_message]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n            if check != \"\":\n                subprocess.Popen([\"nautilus\", \"trash:///\"])\n        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"nautilus\", \"trash:///\"])\n    trash1 = trash2\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*The script also tracks trash actions from possibly attached external drives. If one of these drives has a space in its name, the script will break. I had to rename my external drive, named \"My Passport\", to give an example. That is not caused by the script itself, but by the trash-cli tools the script uses.\n\n*The most elegant way would be (of course) to directly \"untrash\" the files if you pressed \"Cancel\". The trash-cli tools do not provide an option to do that from the command line however, other than an interactive one.\n\n", "Q: How to change default wallpaper in KDE? I'm on KDE 14.14.1 and want to change the default wallpaper. I want to make lots of changes as I want to build a customized kubuntu maybe call it a fork. But there's my problem. There are almost no recent tutorials about customizing Kubuntu (there are lots of old tutorials though).\nSo my question: Where do I find the configuration file(s) for changing the default wallpaper?\nI know I can change them in the settings. However I won't be able to use the GUI when I'm building the iso file for my customized system, so I have to edit the files manually. \n\nA: Default plasma wallpaper\nThe default plasma wallpaper is set in the default desktop theme: /usr/share/kde4/apps/desktoptheme/default/\nThere is the metadata.desktop. It has wallpaper section. With the Kubuntu 14.04 / KDE 4.13:\n[Wallpaper]\ndefaultWallpaperTheme=Elarun\ndefaultFileSuffix=.png\ndefaultWidth=2560\ndefaultHeight=1600\n\nThe 'Elarun' is described in the /usr/share/wallpapers/Elarun/\nMore of the KDE plasma theme details:  https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Plasma4/ThemeDetails\n\nA: A line userswallpapers=path/to/wallpaper in the file ~/.kde/share/config/plasma-desktop-appletsrc is what you're looking for.\nBtw, almost everything you wanted you may easy find in the .kde directory with grep -rniI pattern, where -r stands for recursive, -n stands for show me the line number where the pattern found, -i — ignore case, and the -I — ignore binary files, and the pattern is a text you're looking for. That's easy.\n", "Q: Backing up or mirroring my existing hard drive I'll try to keep it short - I have windows 7 and ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed.  \nWindows has recently stopped working (involving all kinds of messages during start up that say that my hard drive is likely to fail soon)\nI do not have a windows recovery disk/drive handy\nI do, however, have a freshly installed blank second hard drive (internal)\nHow would I go about backing everything up to the second hard drive?  And for future reference, is there a way to have both hard drives sync to each other permanently?\nThank you!\n\nA: If the spare drive is larger than the (supposedly) failing, than you can simply copy the entire disk by using the dd command:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1M\n\n(Of course replace the device file names according to your configuration.)\nNone of these disks should be mounted, so use an Ubuntu LiveCD for running dd.\nIf the disk is indeed failing than you must use additional options so that bad sectors are replaced with 0 bytes.\nIf the disk has a GPT partition table, than you have to prevent to attach disks with identical partition GUIDs.\nIt is not a good idea to mirror a failing disk for obvious reasons. It seems you need a proper backup system. A mirror is not backup! It also mirrors bad data, like the result of rm -rf /. Backup is multiple snapshots taken at different times.\n\nA: You can do this in 2 ways. Either back up Ubuntu manually or mirroring your 2 drives using a RAID 1 configuration.\nBack up Ubuntu\nThis is probably the easiest method. You can use deja dup or a similar tool to back up either individual folders or your whole system to your other drive. There is a guide on using deja dup here.\nSet up drive mirroring using RAID\nThis method takes a bit more work but it is probably easier in the long run. RAID 1 is where your 2 hard drives will mirror each other e.g. if you write 200MB of data to disk it will be automatically written to both drives, therefore if one disk ever fails you will have a complete backup. I've never done this myself, but as far as I know you will have to reinstall Ubuntu to do this. I've found a few guides for you here and here.\nHope this answers your question!\n\nA: Use GParted for easy 1shot mirror\nCatch is: you will need another machine that you can attach both drives to. \nOr boot an OS from USB and then attach both machines to it\n(External drive mount device is a must have IMHO)\nAfter that it is trivial.

My privacy feels invaded by the \"active\" light on my webcam turning on when I boot Ubuntu, and again when I login.  It stays on for 3-4 seconds, then turns back off.\nIt's a Creative HD 1080p webcam that sits on top of the monitor, plugged in via USB.\n\nA: I can confirm this happens on a clean install of Ubuntu and MINT. It doesn't matter which desktop you are using. Don't worry about it.\nP.s I have a logitech webcam too. Nothing to do with branding here.\n\nA: \nWhat is watching me? \n\nNobody. Without any proof (I did google for it a little bit): I seriously doubt that a webcam can transmit a stream to the outside world before the desktop is active. It would be very complicated to make software to do that and it would require you to install it yourself. \n\nAnd why does this happen?\n\nIt is the device being detected by the system. First when the USB system is started the camera gets powered up it will tell you by flashing the light. And the second time will be due to the program that is started during boot to use that webcam (that will probably be the program \"cheese\" or \"skype\") that checks if it can find a camera. That again triggers the light to flash.\nIf you want to get rid of the second one: disable the program to start at boot time and start it manually when you want to use the webcam. If it is indeed during login check \"dash\", \"startup applications\" and check for programs that can use webcams; if there is one you could disable it there.\nIf you want to get rid of the first one you probably need to unplug it before booting (that will also get rid of the second time). As soon as you plug it in it will flash when the webcam gets detected by the system.  \n\nSome independent topics related to this (and not per se Linux):\n\n\n*\n\n*classroom.synonym.com\n\n*e-how.com\nUse common sense. if it always flashes during boot and always at those two specific moments with every boot I would expect this to be normal behaviour of that webcam.\nWhen you need to worry about it flashing is when it flashes during normal operation; When you are using your computer and not using the webcam. If it flashes then you should investigate this. \n\nA: Take a look in /dev/ folder, you will find a file which is /dev/video0. This is your webcam. In order to appear there, in the list of all devices, udev will need to initialize it somehow. That's why it blinks.. Then it's basically just hanging around there in the wait state until cheese or some other program needs to access it, which is when the light will become constantly on.  \nSame occurs every time I plug mine in - it blinks once. Why does it do on start up and shutdown ? Because the script for the service udev (which is in /etc/init.d/udev, by the way) runs on shutdown and startup, to bring devices up and down.\n", "Q: Mouse clicks stop registering in some or all windows I've been running Ubuntu for years without problems, using mostly the same hardware for much of that time.  But recently, I've begun having a strange problem, and I'm not sure where it might be coming from. \nThe mouse clicks stop registering in all the inactive windows.\nI'm running Gnome classic/fallback, with Gnome panel and Cairo dock, and compiz.\nSometimes the problem happens after a day or two, sometimes immediately upon a reboot. If I'm using Firefox, it works fine, although I can no longer move or close the window with the mouse. New windows are simply dead.  If it happens on boot, Cairo dock will work, but no windows.  By work, I mean the mouse clicks; keyboard works normally.\nI've tried resetting Compiz and gnome-panel, which don't help.  What does work, and is the best workaround so far, is to bring up a virtual terminal, then switch back to the GUI using Alt + F7.  Then everything works fine.\nI've tried connecting a different mouse, to no avail (both USB, but I doubt that matters).\nI've seem others that seem to have the same problem, back as far as 12.xx, but no answers.  Seems like some have the problem with xfce, etc.  One person seemed to fix it by updating his system, but I tried that and it didn't help.\nI'm really not sure in what system this problem originates.  The only clue I have that's new is the switching to VT and back.  Whatever is run when switching back must reset the offending system.\nEdit (1)\nI was able to determine that this problem is also exhibited when booting and logging in to the guest session, running Unity.\nI don't know if I have any PS/2 mice hidden away somewhere, but I'll check.  However, both the keyboard and mouse are plugged into the same USB port, and the keyboard works fine.  Also, another USB mouse is plugged into a different USB port, and has the same problem.  One mouse is Logitech, and one is IBM, and I've never had problems with either.\nEdit (2)\nToday, the problem arose while using the system.  I connected another mouse to a different port, which also didn't work.  Then, I disconnected the first mouse and keyboard from the old USB-1 hub, which was connected via an old USB-1 cable, and connected it directly to a USB port on the front of the system.  Problem went away.\nSo, I am now running without the extension cable, but with the hub, to see if the hub itself is OK.  If the problem recurs, I may try it with a USB-2 hub, just to see if perhaps USB-1 might be a problem.  But nothing has changed that recently except software, so maybe it's something in the kernel.\nOne other thing about the problem... There is usually one working window where the mouse works - usually firefox, but I use that a lot, so it's hard to tell for sure.  When I open another window on top of this working window, and try to click or highlight something, the underlying window receives the mouse clicks, and its text will become highlighted just like the top window isn't there.  But the top window does receive the keyboard events.  So, it's puzzling to me how the hub would cause this, but I'm a mere mortal.\n\nA: Well, it's been several days since I removed a short USB cable extension I had connected from the computer's USB-2 port to the cable from the old passive USB hub, and through several reboots and suspends, I've had no more problems\nI hope this might be helpful for others, as I've seen a bunch of very similar, or even duplicate, situations both here and elsewhere.  Mostly, they were older topics, and although I tried posting to get more information, I got no response.\nI'm tempted to wait a while longer before accepting this as the final solution, but I'm afraid I'll forget, so I'll close it now.\n", "Q: apt-get update says I have not permission lately whenever i try to update through the terminal I get this message\nE: could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock  - open (13: permission denied)\nE: unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/\nE: could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock  - open (13: permission denied)\nE: unable to lock administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?\n\nI am using ubuntu 14.04.1 and apt-get had been working just fine until now\n\nA: To run such command you need special permission.\nUse sudo, but be carefull.

We have generic drivers so we generally do not download drivers for our systems to get out systems installed.  \nIn general: you start with a Live DVD, pick \"try Ubuntu\" and have a general assessment of what is working; if at this point something does not work. You can also set up your wireless at this point (if you do that you can use firefox -during- the installation to browse the web).\nThen you choose the installer and have it install (partitioning, setting the username etc).\nWhen this is done you log into your newly created system and will have a working system where the installation installed all drivers for all the hardware it detected. \nAll the 3rd party drivers are shown in a program called \"additional drivers\" and can be installed from there. These drivers are limited to your video card and optionally a wireless driver for cards that use a broadcom chip.\n\nA: I have a 6460b without discrete graphics and with Intel 6205 Wifi.

I have several user accounts set up as \"desktop users\", but when they are logged in, they are unable to open ANY files in their HOME folder.  Error messages vary, but typically indicate that access is denied or user does not have permission.  When I am logged in on my account (as administrator) I have no problem accessing files in my HOME folder.  Any ideas?  I am new to Linux.\n\nA: Users should own their own files.\nOpen a terminal with CTRLALTT or your preferred method\nissue the command sudo chown -R *username* */path/name* where username is the name of the user you want to give ownership to and /path/name is the path to their home directory. This should resolve the vast majority of your issues.\nExample sudo chown -R joe /home/joe\nOnce you have completed this task for all users they will be able to access all the files in (and under) their homes.\nfor more detail see man chown\nhere's an example of what you might see with the command ls-l which was requested of you.\n\nYou'll note the permissions bits in the far left column\nd indicates a directory \nthe 1st letter is d if it's a directory, or - if it's not\nr indicates read permission a - here means that permission doesn't exist (denied)\nw indicates write permission a - here means that permission doesn't exist (denied)\nx indicates execute permission a - here means that permission doesn't exist (denied)\nthese 3 are broken up into 3 sets for User, Group, and Others\nThe User is the owner of the files, Group is everyone belonging to the listed group (in this case the owners group) and Others is everyone else without exclusion. Unless your network is very safe and all users are trusted you need to be very careful with the Others bits.\nThe next field is the number of links, this is followed by the name of the owner and name of the group referred to by the aforementioned bits, then the file size, date, and filename (or directory name if it starts with a d as previously explained)\nYou'll note that there are 2 directories in the image above. (both start with d)\nYou'll note that lost+found is a directory, owned by user root of the root group which only root (the owner) has access to. That access is complete, and unrestricted in any way for user root. No other user has access to this even if they belong to the group root. you'll note the bits for group and others are all --- (or = 0)\nThe other directory is the home of user tvbox who owns it. tvbox (the owner) has rwx permission (complete, unrestricted). members of the group tvbox who are not the user tvbox do not have write access but can otherwise see and enter the directory. Others can also see and traverse the directory. I can change that with the chmod command. As I dont want those that aren't in the tvbox group to have access I'll issue the command chmod o-rx tvbox/ to change only the directory access or chmod -R o-rx tvbox/ to remove read and execute permissions the the tvbox folder and all files and folders within it. \nAfter running one of the above th tvbox directory looks like this:\n drwxr-x--- 61 tvbox tvbox   12288 Feb 22 17:12 tvbox\n\nAs you can see the permissions for others are all denied (non-existent)\nWe can change the permissions for the group by using a g in place of the o or the user (owner) buy using a u in that location you can change them for everyone at once by stringing them together, for instance chmod ugo+rwx filename would give full access to the user, the group and all others. (illustrative -  not what you normally want) Changing to a - from a + would remove the permissions\nSo u = user, g = group and o = others, r = read, w = write and x=execute There's also a way to use chmod numerically. 4=read 2=write and 1=execute and you can add the numbers to obtain the desired result. chmod 776 filename would give full access to owner and group and deny others execute permission while allowing read and write. This is great shorthand for system adminstrators who need to rapidly change permissions on numerous files and directories.\nThe -R means recursive and it can be very dangerous to use it with any command if you aren't sure exactly what you are doing.\n", "Q: Collision hazard? /var/log populated by repair tool, but actual /var located on separate partition Something went wrong in my system, and I used one of the handy boot CDs to repair grub and also iron out some mistakes in device assignments. No big deal, and it worked a treat. Good.\nHowever, the repair software on this boot CD loved to write to /var/log/* and the \"fun\" began.\nMy /var is on a separate partition, whilst this tool joyfully created a brand new /var tree and populated it on my / (once it located it with a valid signature).\nThis is NOT good.\nSupposing, I'd just shut down the PC after repairing and (cold-)boot into my own distro again.  This can't really work, can it?\nBecause I am aware that the system needs a LOT of informational files from /var while starting up. (It's not just used as a \"log file dump\" as most beginners think.) On a VM, I tried that just for the fun of it 2 years ago: the result was that it is impossible to boot with a virgin /var directory. Not even rebuilding the whole tree (subdirectories only, but no files inside) will work. There seems something really important that the startup routines do need for successfully reaching the graphical login screen.\nSo how can it be avoided if some tool created a /var/* tree on your / partition and not much later, the UUID of the /var partition is read by the system and ...? I had once thought that the /var partition will overlay the \"pseudo-/var\" on the / partition, but that seems not the case.\nPlus, this ain't Windows: it's not turned to a /var.backup or /var (2) or anything of that sort.\n/etc/fstab: (UUIDs \"normalized\" for reasons of readability)\n# /boot on /dev/sda1 after cloning system to new HDD\nUUID=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee              /boot    ext4  ro        0  1\n# /     on /dev/sda2 after cloning system to new HDD\nUUID=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee              /        ext4  defaults  0  2\n# /var (NEW) on /dev/sda6 after cloning system to new HDD\nUUID=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee              /var     ext4  defaults  0  2\n# /home on /dev/sda3 after cloning system to new HDD\nUUID=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee              /home    ext4  defaults  0  2\n# /usr on /dev/sda5 after cloning system to new HDD\nUUID=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee              /usr     ext4  defaults  0  2\n# /opt on /dev/sda7 after cloning system to new HDD\nUUID=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee              /opt     ext4  defaults  0  2\n\n\nA: So, you used to have an empty /var on your root filesystem, which was used as a mountpoint for the \"real /var\" which was located on a different filesystem? And when you booted from an ISO, it somehow managed to create a bunch of subdirectories in your \"root\" /var so now you're worried that, after a reboot, the system won't be able to mount your \"real /var\" because the mountpoint has some files and directories in it?\nI don't think you should be concerned, the mount process works just fine in this case. The files located inside your mountpoint become inaccessible (until you unmount the partition), and the whole contents of the mountpoint is \"replaced\" by the contents of the mounted partition.\nThe only negative side-effect I can think of is that some disk space will be wasted by the logs you don't need, but, then again, I think it would be quite safe to delete them.\n", "Q: Unable to boot to encrypted root partition after Ubuntu 14.10 upgrade I am running a Lenovo T440p with a clean install of Ubuntu.

I have studied many google articles most of which involve magical incantations of one form or another, but nothing I can do will make it work.\nThe vncserver log file complains \"error opening security policy file /etc/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy\" followed by a bunch of messsages \"Could not init font path element....\"\nAfter that it shows what appears to be valid connections or disconnections, but I can never get any thing to display on the screen. Surely this should just work right out of the box.\nI decided to add to this post from the Ubuntu computer so I can add so I can add the log and xstartup file using cut and paste.\n     Sun Feb 22 17:42:13 2015\n      vncext:      VNC extension running!\n      vncext:      Listening for VNC connections on port 5901\n      vncext:      created VNC server for screen 0\n     error opening security policy file /etc/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy\n     Could not init font path element /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/, removing from list!\n     Could not init font path element /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/, removing from list!\n     Could not init font path element /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/, removing from list!\n     Could not init font path element /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/, removing from list!\n     Could not init font path element /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/, removing from list!\n     Could not init font path element /usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/, removing from list!\n     Could not init font path element /usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/, removing from list!\n\n     Sun Feb 22 17:42:42 2015\n      Connections: accepted: 0.0.0.0::54270\n      SConnection: Client needs protocol version 3.8\n      SConnection: Client requests security type VncAuth(2)\n\n     Sun Feb 22 17:42:49 2015\n      SConnection: AuthFailureException: Authentication failure\n      Connections: closed: 0.0.0.0::54270 (Authentication failure)\n\n     Sun Feb 22 17:43:21 2015\n      Connections: accepted: 0.0.0.0::54281\n      SConnection: Client needs protocol version 3.8\n      SConnection: Client requests security type VncAuth(2)\n\n     Sun Feb 22 17:43:28 2015\n      VNCSConnST:  Server default pixel format depth 16 (16bpp) little-endian rgb565\n      VNCSConnST:  Client pixel format depth 16 (16bpp) little-endian rgb565\n\n     Sun Feb 22 17:43:41 2015\n      Connections: closed: 0.0.0.0::54281 (Clean disconnection)\n      SMsgWriter:  framebuffer updates 3\n      SMsgWriter:    ZRLE rects 4, bytes 1380\n      SMsgWriter:    raw bytes equivalent 3146800, compression ratio 2280.289855\n\n     #!/bin/sh\n\n     # Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:\n     unset SESSION_MANAGER\n     exec sh /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\n\n     [ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] &amp;&amp; exec /etc/vnc/xstartup\n     [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] &amp;&amp; xrdb $HOME/.Xresources\n     #xsetroot -solid grey\n     #vncconfig -iconic &\n     #x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title \"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\" &\n     startx &amp;\n\n\nA: With help from steeldriver the solution is mind-blowingly simple.

When running Orbiter, I get ~1 FPS, and it maxes out one of my CPU's cores (I have an i5). I run Orbiter by \"wine orbiter.exe\". All dependencies are satisfied. Wine is V1.6.2. It was working fine on Arch Linux, but I upgraded to Kubuntu 14.04 LTS, and had to reinstall my programs. The video settings which previously yielded an acceptable framerate (~20-30, depending on scenery) now have me at around 1 FPS. Any ideas?\nXenoth\n\nA: Just a suggestion but try setting the default program to open exes to wine windows program loader, and then click on it. If you're using the terminal, it might make orbiter lag, although I don't know why it would do that.\n", "Q: Show photo/video slideshow with photo captions I'm trying to find a straightforward way to create a date-ordered slideshow from a directory that contains a mix of photos and videos (e.g. the output of a smartphone camera from a holiday). Ideally the slideshow will include the photo metadata (EXIF) captions too at the bottom of the screen, although this isn't absolutely necessary.\nSo far I've looked at a few solutions, here is why each one fails:\nDigikam - slideshows work well with photos (incl. showing captions) but don't include video files\ngThumb - like Digikam the slideshow feature ignores videos. Browsing through the directory in full screen mode plays videos but there's a great big 'properties' dialog that takes up a 3rd of the screen that I can't get rid of\nKdenlive - very fiddly requires that I manually insert the video files between the image files to get the date ordering right. Doesn't show the captions\nVLC - only shows the video file and ignores the image files, when showing image files goes by filename and not date\nffDiaporama - broken on Ubuntu 14.04, crashes with\nPreset /usr/share/ffDiaporama/libx264-hq.ffpreset specified for stream 0:0, but could not be opened.\n\nEdit:\nI searched around a bit more and found that KDE's Gwenview might be the closest solution to what I want here:\nGwenview - Open the first image in the folder with Gwenview. View->Sort By->Date. Click 'Fullscreen' and move the mouse to bring up the on-screen controls, click the 'play' icon to start a slideshow. This shows the photos and plays videos.\nUnfortunately the delay before switching images is not configurable (seems to be 5 seconds by default) but you can use the arrow keys or mouse to move to the next photo or video when you want. Also does not display captions.\n\nA: Install ffDiaporama from stable repository. It's working.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ffdiaporamateam/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ffdiaporama\n\n\nA: In gwenview\nGo to plugins > tools > advanced slideshow\nIf Plugins is empty (by default I think kubuntu doesn't install them) you need to add kipi-plugins I think.

If anyone has any advice or even the answer to my problem, please let me know so I can successfully reboot my Windows 8 alongside my Ubuntu!\nHere is the link to my error report:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/10365235/\n\nA: After seeing your error report I was wondering, since I had Ubuntu 14.04 alongside with Windows 8.1. But for dual booting I made legacy mode enabled so after 2/3 months my pc started facing problems. As this legacy setting should be disabled for Windows 8/8.1. So am using it in VM ware now. So I think if you are using licensed copy of windows then don't use dual booting because it may cause problems while booting of windows, prefer using Virtual machine and if you are having pirated version of windows see once boot-up settings. From your error report I came to know one thing that may be you haven't done the disk partition well enough.

I downloaded the .iso and unpacked it to a folder on my HD. What next?\n\nA: The ISO file is too large to fit on a CD.  You will need to either burn it to a DVD, or write it to a USB thumb drive of sufficient capacity.\nThe instrucitons for actually burning an image to a DVD or USB thumb drive will vary, and will also depend on the operating system you are using.\nPlease see one of the following guides for more information:\nBurning to DVD: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\nUsing USB stick: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\nThe first option, burning to DVD, will be much easier to follow especially if you're on Windows, and I would recommend it unless you don't have the ability to burn DVDs.\n", "Q: npm unresponsive after nodejs install on fresh Ubuntu 12.04.5 Here's where I'm at...\nI have an old chromebook that I put Ubuntu (and Xfce) on via crouton.

For example, /dev/tnt0 and /dev/tnt1 are connected as if using a direct cable.\nPersisting across boots\nEdit the file /etc/modules (Debian) or /etc/modules.conf\nsudo nano /etc/modules.conf\n\nand add the following line:\ntty0tty\n\nWarning\nNote that this method will not make the module persist over kernel updates so if you ever update your kernel, make sure you build tty0tty again repeat the process.\nIf you don't move the module on every kernel update systemctl --failed will return that service systemd-modules-load.service ended \"failed\". Also on journalctl -xe | grep \"Failed to find\".\n", "Q: How can i make a LiveUSB of WIndows 8? buddies.\nYeah, i'm kinda noob in this so i need help...

If I start a new rxvt pasting works fine but after a while (I'm unsure how long) pasting with the middle mouse button no longer works (in any program). \nI can see with xsel that the text is copied and I can see with xev that X receives \"button 2\" when I press the button (which is actually remapped to Command_R in OSX). When I start a new rxvt-instance then pasting starts to work again (for a while) in all open rxvt-windows. Starting an xterm also gets it to work again, but starting xclock does not. So it seems like someone removes the paste function from the button 2 event, and that it is re-added when a terminal is started.\nAny ideas on how to debug this?\n\nA: I wouldn't count this as an answer, and I don't have the rep to comment, but if you haven't seen it already, this page and this other question might at least help get you going in the right direction. I'm not sure what the problem is exactly, but if it's an issue within Ubuntu, you may be able to write a script to remap the middle mouse button, and if it's an issue with the VMWare, modifying the .vmx file might work, at least as a workaround solution. \n\nA: Mystery solved! I use \"xkbset m\" to enable keyboard keys to emulate mouse buttons. It turns out that this operation has a timeout (not documented in the horrible man-page) so this was what made the paste operation stop working. Since I ran \"xkbset m\" in my .bashrc that was the reason things would start working again whenever a new terminal was started.\nIt is still somewhat of a mystery to me why xev still sees the button 2 events on the key since that sort of indicates that X still gets a mouse button event from the Command_R key.\nAnyway, this fix was to replace \"xkbset m\" with \"xkbset exp =m\".\nI found the solution here\n", "Q: Second display won't work with nvidia drivers I have recently installed Ubuntu but the drivers from x.org are not so good, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*the display with NVidia graphics card (plugged by HDMI) has some problems server x from x.org nouveau driver from xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (open source)\n\n*the second one plugged by DVI to the Intel GPU works just fine. \n\n\nAfter driver change to NVidia drivers nvidia binary driver version 470.76 from nvidia-340 (opensource) I noticed that the HDMI display works fine, but the DVI one is just blank and not detected neither by the NVidia x server settings nor the system display settings.\n\nA: The standard Ubuntu NVidia drivers generate some problems on slightly older and slightly newer NVidia hardware.\nIf you want more then the standard Ubuntu repository drivers, install the xorg.edgers PPA.

Is there a way to install Ubuntu on a laptop when the BIOS version is older than 2000? When I try to, the installation fails. I have tried early versions of Ubuntu as well.\nWhen first booting, it reports that the BIOS is older than 2000, then boots to the installation menu and goes through pre-install setup. When the installation starts, it locks up. I think the laptop might be too old. It has a Pentium 2 processor with 512 MB of RAM at 333 Mhz.\n\nA: I don't think it is a BIOS problem at ALL. It never is. I'm sorry, but your computer is horribly slow for Ubuntu... I found that out before seeing the minimum system requirements. A Pentium 2 @ 333 MHz with 512 MB of RAM compared to the minimum system requirements for Ubuntu is comparing a turtle to a car. Try installing Lubuntu instead. It is a version of Ubuntu with much less requirements and a lighter interface and according to their site on Ubuntu wiki, it can run on your system, although not fast enough for daily use...\nIn case you do not need a graphical user interface (GUI) and can use the command line (consult Google), you can use Ubuntu Server instead, which is super lightweight, but I wouldn't use it to do anything the average user does, since, sadly, it cannot do that stuff.\nYou can consider a $35 Raspberry Pi 2 if your computer is a desktop, and that microcomputer can run Ubuntu and is a sports car to the computer you have.\n", "Q: GUI program to create partition backup image no larger than its files? I like 'Disks' (gnome-disk-utility) and its ability to create backups of system partitions.\n\nBut at some point I read on the internet about a program that would create such images that are not as large as the whole partition, but only as large as the files on it. Now I cannot find it again.\nIs there such an utility? \n\nA: The following answer uses a TUI, not a GUI solution:\nDepending on your use-case (I use it to make system back-ups) you can use CloneZilla Live.  It can create: \n\n\n*\n\n*sparse images, \n\n*compressed images of:\n\n\n*\n\n*entire systems, \n\n*entire drives \n\n*simply individual partitions.  \n\n\n\nThe main advantages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*that it boots from:\n\n\n*\n\n*external media\n\n*internal media\n\n\n*comes with its own OS (based on Ubuntu) \n\n*it can make exact cold system back-ups that are easily restored.  \n\n\nOn top of all these goodies, it can copy MBRs as well.\nIf a cold system back-up is not what you're looking for, you can still use the technology that CloneZilla is based upon and that is partclone.\n\nA: Achieving smaller disk images is usually done by ways of not copying zero outed blocks from the initial file system in the image. The concept is called sparse space in files or puching holes in files, and your host file system has to support it. \na bit command line but try this:\nsudo apt-get install virt-manager qemu-utils \n\nAnd then once it's install you can use :\nqemu-img convert -f raw -O raw  /dev/sdX /home/<user>/Ubuntu.img\n\nThis will create a sparse ( zeros in the file aren't written) image of your disk. \nwhere -f = format, -O output format. sdX the disk ( can use partitions as well).\nThe program has advanced features such as snapshots and different output formats (vdi, vmdk, etc).\nYour place where you save the image has to support sparse files, or else the size will be just as big, since zeros in the partition will be written to disk. And to make the most of it, do run a program such as sfill or zerofree found in apt on the partition, because free space does not always mean zero space, and you want to maximize the amount of zero space on the file system. \nBonus ninja points. Since linux thinks of disks as \"files\", then you could also use plain cp, with the condition that your output partition where you park the file knows sparse files.\nsudo cp --sparse=always /dev/sdX /home/<user>/Ubuntu.img\n\nWhich will create a raw copy by means of cp..\nExamples of filesystems that support sparse : ext4, btrfs, xfs, ntfs ( ntfs-3g however might not allow sparse writes).\nExamples of filesystems that do not : fat32.\n\nA: As there doesn't seem to be any program that all by itself would satisfy the two conditions:\n1) Have a 'Disks'-like GUI; \n2) Create disk-image as large as the space used,\nI was thinking about a rather simple workaround, but one involving two GUI programs, very common in Ubuntu:\nOne would be the same  'Disks' (gnome-disk-utility), used to to create a backup image of a given partition, and the second would be Gparted, to shrink the partition as much as possible before creating its backup image, and to resize it back to original after that.\nI see no inconvenient in a such operation: shrinking a partition down to minimum would only take a few minutes (about a minute for 10GB) and would create an empty space to the right. After making a backup image of the disk with 'Disks', using Gparted the partition can be resized back to the right into the empty space up to its initial state, and that would take only a few seconds.\nTested on a partition with an Ubuntu installation: \n\n\n*\n\n*shrink partition with Gparted as much as possible\n\n*backup image of that partition with Disks\n\n*restore image with Disks onto a partition larger than the image; that partition should be un-mounted first: How to correctly restore system partition (iso image) with 'Disks'.\n\nA: Edit: This will not work well if files deleted from the filesystem are still present on the partition, so first it's necessary to wipe the free space on the target partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the target partition\n\n*Run dd if=/dev/zero of=<path_to_partition_volume>/file.dd && rm <path_to_partition_volume>/file.dd\n\n*Unmount the target partition\n\n\nThen:\n\nYou can read the whole partition block by block with dd and output everything to a compression utility like gzip. Most likely any compression tool, even using the fastest/lowest compression settings, will compress all the free space during the process.\nWith gzip:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdX | GZIP=-1 gzip >/path/to/backup.gz\n(GZIP=-1 temporarily sets the environment variable GZIP to -1 to achieve the fastest/lowest compression)\nTo restore a backup:\ngzip -d /path/to/backup.gz >/dev/sdX\n\nA: How about using ddrescue with -S option?\nddrescue -S /dev/sdXY /<path_to_backup>/backup.img\n\nThis will clone each block but zero blocks found in block device /dev/sdXY to /<path_to_backup>/backup.img\n\nA: It can't be used to make a copy to a smaller drive. When I have a 64 Gb drive that is only 10% filled with data. I would like to be able to copy that to a 6 Gb imagefile, that I can copy on its turn to a 16Gb drive and than expand it to 16 gb\nThe only possibility I know now is use GParted to shrink the original, than copy it and then resize both. A very risky operation, since you need to shrink and resize the original.\n\nA: You could use rsync to backup just the files on the partition to another partition. Or tar to create a compressed archive containing all files.\nBoth probably have (multiple) GUIs, but I've never used those myself.\n\nA: Clonezilla can actually be quite friendly.  The live CD doesn't require any command line usage - I'd be quite happy to call it a GUI even though it doesn't use the mouse - and I think the defaults are OK for a lot of cases.  The problem is something you didn't explicitly call out: it doesn't seem to be designed as something you can install on an arbitrary linux system.  It's packaged for Debian / Ubuntu specifically, and the Live CD is the easiest way to run it.\n\nClonezilla / partclone use filesystem-aware cloning and use their own compressed image format.\nThere's another non-GUI possibility to generate simple (mountable) sparse files, that doesn't rely on detecting zero sectors.\nvirt-sparsify /dev/your-block-device backup.img\n\nIf /tmp is a ramdisk it will warn that it potentially needs more space for temporary files.  So you might need to add the option --tmp /var/tmp.\n", "Q: cannot upgrade Kubuntu 14.10 I have Kubuntu 14.10 with Linux desktop001 3.16.0-30-generic #40-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jan 12 22:06:37 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux kernel and when I issue command for system upgrade: clear && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get autoremove, the updare stops at: 100% [Waiting for headers] and after some time I get warnings and error:\nW: Failed to fetch http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/saucy/main/binary-i386/Packages  0  Requested Range Not Satisfiable [IP: 217.31.202.63 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/saucy/universe/binary-i386/Packages  0  Requested Range Not Satisfiable [IP: 217.31.202.63 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/inameiname/stable/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/inameiname/stable/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

If I dual boot install both Ubuntu and Windows, is it safer to install them on two different hard drives than different partitions on the same hard drive? \nWhat risks may be involved? For example, one OS does not recognize the files of another OS. One OS accidentally wipes out the other OS by some system operations?\n\nA: If you have two hard drives, then installing Windows on one and Ubuntu (or any other OS) on the other is the most convenient.\n\n\n*\n\n*most modern Windows PC's come with three partitions already installed - a recovery partition, the \"System Reserved\" partition, and finally your primary Windows partition. If only 3 Primary partitions are defined, create an extended partition and install Ubuntu there.\n\n*Assuming Windows consumes your entire first hard drive, then you must resize those Windows partitions. \n\n*There is a sense of security when installing the second OS on a separate hard drive. With two hard drives, you can just slip the primary one out (in the case of a laptop) or disconnect the power (for a desktop). Now you know that you are not going to accidentally corrupt your main OS while installing the other. For the truly paranoid, you can do the same when upgrading to newer versions. \nE.g. My machine supports four hard drives; so I run Windows 7 on the primary and Ubuntu on the second. Rather than use the Linux boot loader to select my OS, I simply use the BIOS boot screen to choose to boot from the first or second hard drive. If I press the power button and walk away, then it boots from the primary disk unattended.\nUbuntu will be happy to mount your Windows partitions so that you can access your files. \nAnother option to consider is to use a virtual machine. I use VMware on my Windows partition  The only caveat is that you need enough memory and CPU power to run both OS's simultaneously.\nOne comment about redundancy - if you plan to set up any kind of disk redundancy (mirroring or RAID-5 striping) you need to have hard drives of close to the same size to avoid wasting space (the system will use the size of the smallest drive). A hardware approach is much more reliable and performs better than a simple software-based solution. You MUST back up any data you do not want to lose!\n\nA: In general, they should leave each other alone. If you do the install correctly (Windows first, then Linux, as a rule, because Linux is more 'considerate'). As far as I am aware, there is no additional risk involved in sharing a drive. \nHaving said that, here are some gotchas to watch out for.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows will not be able to see the contents of your Linux drive or partition, unless you install additional software. ext4fsd works for me.\n\n*Shared storage partitions. If there is a partition which both OSes can see natively, meaning FAT32 or NTFS, then there can be issues with data loss. If Windows goes into hibernation, and another OS makes changes to the shared partition, Windows will tend to undo the changes when it is resumed. I recommend either external storage, or disabling hibernation on Windows, or both.\n\n*UEFI. This is new with Windows 8. There are two types of firmware interface, BIOS (older) and UEFI (newer). Both operating systems need to be installed using the same one. You can find a much more in-depth explanation here.\n\nA: It is safer to use 2 hard disks. \n\n\n*\n\n*during formatting it is easier to recognize the different hard disks. 1 will be named sda and the other sdb. Though the installer puts names next to bootable partitions it does help to find other partitions that belong to that specific OS (like a D: drive will be sda2 on sda where sda1 is the OS for Windows or db2 is a partition for sdb where sdb1 is the root for Ubuntu).\n\n*hard drive failure. Does one drive fail you take it out and still boot into the other OS (maybe with the help of GRUB recovery). \nI myself though would install the bootable partitions (ie. the operating system (C: and /)) on the fastest hard drive and put my data on the other drive. \nBut... backups and being able to restore them is more important. The best thing to do is make regular backups of your important data. If you do that you will only have minor problems.\n\nA: Short answer:\nIt doesn't matter at all.\nDetailed answer:\nThere is absolutely no risk with keeping two operating systems on the same disk device. You can mess with another system partition as long as the disk device with that partition is accesible, putting it on separate physical device doesn't make it safer (nor less safe) in any way.\n\nA: From a strict system point of view, it is exactly the same ... provided you correctly configure your partitions. Correctly configured partitions are perfectly safe to use and you will never inadvertantly erase date in one partition while working on another one - be they under same OS or not.\nIf you configure them by hand hacking the Master Boot Record with low level tools ... it depends on your proficiency  with such tools ! But if you use high level tools to resize partitions and create next, you should not get into trouble.\nAs you asked for a safer way, my advice would be to split both disks with one Windows partition and one (or more) Ubuntu ones on each. That way, you could easily duplicate sensitive data on a second disk for any OS. You could even build a RAID-1 mirror for your (or one of your) Ubuntu partition(s). But I must admit it is a rather advanced configuration if you cannot afford (or do not want) to duplicate everything.\n\nA: It would statistically be less safe to install onto two separate drives. If one drive fails you lose half of your data. Conversely, installing both OSs to one drive and keeping the (hypothetical?) second drive as a backup drive would give you a form of redundancy should one drive fail.\nAs far as your system is concerned, it doesn't matter if you partition one drive twice and install both operating systems there or install onto two separate drives. \nInstall both correctly and there is no danger of one OS wiping the other. You will likely need to grant access from each OS to the other if you want to share files between systems.\n", "Q: How should I encrypt Ubuntu Server 14.04 with AES on RAID 10 and RAID 5? After researching I've come to the conclusion that my set up is just not standard enough to have a direct answer floating about on the interwebs.  \nMy Hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*i7 950 CPU\n\n*24 GB DDR3\n\n*7 2TB 7200 RPM HDDs\n\n\nMy Goals:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fast, light-weight, secure server to run CPU/memory intensive programs (basically run server at 80% continuously)\n\n*Large storage space for movies, TV, whatever else\n\n*Host a few VMs (lets say 3 ubuntu desktop 14.04)\n\n*system firewall (leaning towards ufw) in addition to external HW FW\n\n*Encrypt all 7 disks\n\n*require a USB drive and password to access drives and boot the Ubuntu 14.04 server\n\n\nSoftware RAID Partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*md0 300GB Software RAID 10\n\n*md1 9.5TB Software RAID 5\n\n\nEach disk's partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*100GB Software RAID 10 \n\n*1.9TB Software RAID 5 \n\n*10GB swap\n\n\nI understand the Ubuntu Live installer uses dm-crypt with the option of AES.  How much will this affect my performance?  Is it worth not encrypting the RAID 5 array for storage, where encryption is not as important?  How can I require a USB drive with a private key to boot the system, in addition to a passphrase?  I'd like the USB drive to be required just to boot the system, and be removed if the system is in-use.  Is there a way to use stronger encryption?\nAs far as I can tell, AES is the best option for performance.  \nHow should I proceed to encrypt Ubuntu Server 14.04 with AES on RAID 10 and RAID 5 using the above parameters?\n\nA: *\n\n*Software RAID: Don't do it! \nI've never ever in my entire career seen a software RAID actually gracefully recover from damaged hardware, whereas I've seen tons of software RAIDs crap out create problems when there were no hardware problems at all...\n\n*Back-up: \nRAID is a protection against a single disk failure (or dual disk failure in case of RAID-6)!  It is not a replacement for back-ups!  \nMake monthly system back-ups using CloneZilla, and weekly file back-ups using whatever software you like.  Don't encrypt the back-ups unless the encryption is purely password-hash-based as an encrypted back-up encrypted by keys is unrestorable if you lose the keys...\nMake regular back-ups of the USB key you're going to use to boot the system (e.g. at system shutdown) and use an SLC USB stick (4GB should be plenty) and not an MLC one.\n\n*Software encryption: \nOn top of hardware RAID, I'm advising you to take a decent hardware encryption granddaughter-board on top of your Hardware RAID daughter board.\nThat is my recommendation for your use case...\n\nA: For using a keyfile in addition to a passphrase, this link should help (though I haven't tried these instructions myself):\nhttps://www.finnie.org/2009/07/26/keyfile-based-luks-encryption-in-debian/\nThe CPU impact of FDE with LUKS is negligible, especially since you have an i7 which comes with built-in AES optimization. Unless you are trying to squeeze the last 2% of processing power out of your server, it will not be an issue. Your IO speed will always be the bottleneck, not AES. As comparison, your filesystem mounting options like atime or enabling/disable drive sleep will make much more of a performance impact in every use case.\nEdit: Also, I actually suggest software raid. Hardware RAID is great until your RAID card goes out and you have to figure out how to extract the data or rebuild it, which involves sourcing an exact duplicate model of your card (which will likely take days with shipping). And whether or not you can just plug in the drives and go depends on what options the card provides. Hardware RAID can increase performance significantly vs software RAID, but it can be a headache when it fails. Software RAID is also much easier to manage in most situations.\n"]
