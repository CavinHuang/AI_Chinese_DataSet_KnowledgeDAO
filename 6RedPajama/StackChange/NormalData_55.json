["Q: How can I kill the Jenkins process? I have Jenkins running on my computer and occupying port 8080.\n\nI'm unable to kill it.\nSomething like ps -9 PID would kill the process, but Jenkins will restart with a different PID.\nI thought maybe when Jenkins was started, there was also a user \"jenkins\" created. I searched for that user in \"System Preferences > Users & Groups\" but I couldn't find it.\nAny idea how I can terminate Jenkins? Maybe I need to delete the user \"jenkins\" ?\n\nA: Launch daemons\nOn macOS, Jenkins runs as a launch daemon, or simply daemon, which is just a fancy name for a specific way to have a program run in the background. According to Apple’s developer reference, a daemon on macOS is:\n\n[...] a program that runs in the background as part of the overall system (that is, it is not tied to a particular user).\n\nLaunch daemons are associated with a macOS-internal process called launchd, which runs all the time. One of launchd’s various responsibilities is to (re-)launch a daemon whenever it deems it necessary. This also explains the behavior you described that Jenkins seems to respawn on its own after it is forcibly sent the KILL signal.\nStopping and uninstalling Jenkins\nThere is more than one way to stop a running Jenkins instance. As per the original documentation of the Jenkins installer for macOS, the following steps are the recommended way to terminate a Jenkins instance on macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app (you did that already; if not, type terminal into a Spotlight search field and hit Enter)\n\n*If you want to stop Jenkins only once, run the following command:\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.jenkins-ci.plist\n\n\n*If you would rather uninstall Jenkins altogether, also run the following command (including the single quotes):\n'/Library/Application Support/Jenkins/Uninstall.command'\n\n", "Q: OS X Installation USB not detected in Startup Disk selection I have a MacBook Pro 8.2. Recently I have download Sierra and Yosemite, and am currently running El Capitan.\n\nAnd I created a bootable USB for OS X Yosemite with DiskMaker X 6, in case Sierra goes wrong.\n\nBut when I try to check the USB, it's not on Startup Disk. I tried the option key on mac boot, but the USB is not there.\n\nI'm using SanDisk Cruzer Glide Media, here the USB details.\n\n\n\n\nA: In order to boot from an external disk it must have a GUID Partition Map. If your USB disk is not formatted with that you will need to reformat it accordingly.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Disk Utility\n\n*Select \"Erase\"\n\n*Select GUID from the \"Scheme\" dropdown menu\n\n\nA: From the last image you posted, the window says \"Bootable: No\". From the screenshot you posted of the files on the USB, this doesn't look like a standard bootable OS X USB. For Yosemite, you could try using Terminal (I'm not sure how Terminal would handle the periods and dashes in your USB's name, so here are the instructions if your USB is named Untitled):\nNote that this process automatically erases and formats the USB before moving the files (it normally will confirm this with you), but I like to erase it myself before I do this as a precaution.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app\n\nAfter the process finishes, I believe the USB is named \"Install OS X Yosemite\"\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\n\nA: Mine does the same thing\nTerminal says creating bootable.. and it says yes during the make process but later in get info in disk utility it says no for bootable.\nI did all kinds of privacy for the file to open anyway and ownership and no matter it just does not boot or flag as bootable with Any method.\nDiskcreator 6 no go\nTrans mac no go\nTerminal says yes but info later says no bootable.\nI have downloaded straight from Apple and unpacked to view cert is updated. \nAll 3 of the 2.0 USB sticks installed the same mac oses from Lion to Mojave up until this recert stuff. \nAny help on this A1466 EMC2925 Air book would help.\n", "Q: How can I see app reviews in itunesconnect from all store fronts? Itunesconnect says my app has \"6 reviews\" (woohoo!), but I can't see them. It says \"No reviews for this store front\". I assume (after some googling) that the store front is associated with country. I tried changing from United States in the dropdown at the top, but United States is the only choice.  I'd like to see all reviews regardless of store front/language. Is this possible?\n\n\nA: I think it just mean you have 6 people rated your app but no one has written any reviews. But I don't think it is possible to see reviews from all regions.\nIt could also be possible that review takes time to show up. source\n\nYour review might need to be approved before it's published, so it might not appear immediately.\n\n", "Q: Two-factor Authentication closed loop. Devices can't approve each other! After recently updating iOS on my iPhone I was asked to approve my iPhone from another Apple device of mine. I believe an approval code was sent that I never received because it was sent to the device I am trying to approve. I saw my phone number appear on the screen, and confirmed it because it is my current number, not realizing where this would lead.\nI can't approve my iPhone from my Mac because it's not running El Capitan yet. I have now started a lengthy Time Machine backup and am looking into the steps for a clean install since the Mac has performance issues that a standard update will likely not solve. This had to be done anyway, but it's going to be a process, and I still don't know if my iPhone will trust my Mac since the Mac doesn't have an existing history of 2FA usage.\nI can't approve my iPhone from the household iPad because it uses another family member's account for iCloud. I hoped that because I make iTunes purchases on the iPad with my Apple ID that the iPhone would trust it, but it does not. In fact, the opposite has happened - after signing in with a now-suspect Apple ID the iPad is now also waiting for approval and refusing to trust the iPhone.\nI cannot log into icloud.com for the same reason, so there's no hope of authenticating from there.\nThis has become a nightmare spiraling out of control, with my Apple devices all asking to be approved and none of them trusting each other. What can I do to prove that I am me, and get my iCloud and devices functioning again?\n\nA: If you select your phone number, your phone will receive the text and automatically fill in the code for you. I do not believe that macs are able to receive 2FA codes. \n\nA: HEYYYY!!! I figured it out! So what you have to do is sign into your Apple ID account from the apple website. This is from the account manage page. Next scroll down to and make sure you have a reliable recovery email...if not change it. Next under \"Security\" click the edit button at the top right. After doing so turn off \"Two-Factor Authentication \"... once you press this you will have to set up some recovery question and answers. After this apple will make you select your recovery email so they can lastly send a 6 digit code to confirm that you are turning the Two-factor Authentication off. That pretty much completes it... you should be out of the loop.\nI do have a MacBook and I was stuck in the loop hole along with my iPhone. This one adjustment worked for both of my devices. \n", "Q: Why do ios need restart for bold settings? Why there is a restart required for changing the text boldness in iOS? For text size there is no such requirement, why only for test boldness?\n\nA: It's not a restart but rather a respring. All that happens is the SpringBoard is restarted, not the actual device rebooting. This is because the bold text option changes the text displayed by the SpringBoard, unlike the text size.\n", "Q: How can I tell an Automator action, that the source path of a document should also be the destination path? I'm using the Automator action \"Convert to PDF\" from ABBYY FineReader Pro. It just does OCR recognition on a given file and saves the output to a new PDF. \nIt looks like this: \n\nThe issue I'm having is the output folder (\"Ausgabe speichern in\"). I want to tell Automator, that the full path of the input file is also the desired path of the output file (nice to have: and appends \"-ocr\" to the filename).\nI already found out, that this could be done with the AppleScript snippet, that you see on the bottom of the screenshot. Unfortunately, the files will end up in /Applications, because the ABBYY app is in there and so the variable isn't being interpreted as I wanted it to be.\nAny insights and hints will be highly appreciated.\n\nA: Okay, I downloaded the ABBYY_FineReader_Pro_ESD.dmg file from abbyy.com and installed it, then opened it to look at the help file for use with Automator. It didn't have much information so I checked the link in the help file back at abbyy.com and while it had some additional info, it did't have what I was looking for. Namely, documentation on programmatically setting  \"Output filename:\" to a variable, like can be done with \"Save output to:\" setting it to a variable.\nThe following is an example of an Automator workflow, saved as a Service, to take a selected Image file in Finder and convert it to and editable PDF document. You can see in the image below what settings are relevant. Note that the only option in the Variable Options for the current_path variable only has a Name: field, no Script field. And while the image is taken in OS X 10.8.5 nonetheless I tested it in macOS 10.12 and Automator doesn't show Variable Options as in your picture. (So how did you get it like that?)\n\nI set \"Save output to:\" by drag and drop the current_path variable onto it and then saved the Service. It important that you don't run the Service from within Automator because if done from Automator it changes \"Save output to:\" the containing folder's path and doesn't reset like it does automatically when it run as a Service from Finder. \n", "Q: iPhone wipe- \"Verification Failed. There was a problem connecting to the server.\" I wiped my iPhone 5s, but in the process of re-setting it up, it says \"verification failed, there was a problem connecting to the server\" after I tried submitting the two-factor identification code- even though the wifi is working. \nI tried to call apple support, but I have to have some \"IBN\"(?) number that I can only get to by going to settings, which I can't do because my iPhone isn't functioning yet. This number supposedly also comes with the packaging which I don't have anymore because I got the phone almost a year ago.\nSo, right now I'm stuck with a phone that won't log in, and I can't reach customer support about it. I've tried doing a hard reset with the lock and home button and retrying, but it won't work. What do I do?\n\nA: Connect the phone to iTunes and set it up. That will remove any need to enter any data on the device or from the device. Once you do that one time, you can then set up the phone as you wish. \n", "Q: Mac Automator/Word 2016 macro: Trying to make workflow/macro that removes highlights from bullet points in Word 2016 for Mac THE PROBLEM\nI am working in Microsoft Word 2016 for Mac on a very large bullet-point outline in which I frequently need to highlight text. If I highlight all the text on a bullet point, word automatically highlights the bullet point as well. This is because Word by default makes its bullet points take on the styles of their associated text, including highlights. This default behavior has always somewhat irked me because I find the resulting highlighting of bullet points distracting and sloppy.\nPREVIOUS MANUAL FIXES\nPreviously, I have manually fixed the issue. For example, I sometimes would highlight only part of the associated text, then highlighting the rest of text (partially fixing the issue ex ante--but not allowing me to highlight all the text I wanted to at once). Other times, I would fix the issue ex post: I would highlight all the associated text, resulting in the bullet point becoming highlighted, but would then delete the bullet point, bring my text into line with the previous unhighlighted bullet point, and then click \"enter\" to create a new unhighlighted bullet point (this worked because the text associated with the previous bullet point was not completely highlighted).\nTHE NEED FOR AUTOMATION\nNow, however, I am dealing with a very long document and repetitively manually fixing the issue would be far too inefficient. Thus, I am now looking for a solution that fixes/prevents the bullet point highlighting without me having to make arduous individual changes each time I highlight all the text associated with a bullet point.\nMy hope is that I could create either an Automator workflow or Microsoft Word 2016 (for Mac) macro that, upon activation, would either: (i) highlight only the associated text of a bullet point--leaving the bullet point unhighlighted--or (ii) automatically remove the highlighting of a highlighted bullet point while leaving the associated text highlighted. With regard to option (ii), I would be happy with a workflow/macro that either (a) removed highlighting from an individual bullet point or (b) removed highlighting from all bullet points in a given document--though the latter is probably preferable. Does anyone have any ideas as to whether any of these options are feasible, and, if so, which would be easiest to implement?\n\nA: I figured out how to do it with a Word macro (VBA). The below will highlight only the text (and not the bullet point) of the paragraph/associated text where the cursor is. You can keybind the macro to make this pretty fast. However, this is not the fastest fix because it doesn't allow you to highlight en masse, but it certainly is way faster than doing it manually. \nHope this can help someone who runs into the same problem that I had!\nSub Highlighter_Macro()\n'\n' Highlighter_Macro Macro\n'\n'\n    Selection.EndKey Unit:=wdLine\n    Selection.MoveUp Unit:=wdParagraph, Count:=1\n    Selection.MoveDown Unit:=wdParagraph, Count:=1, Extend:=wdExtend\n    Selection.MoveLeft Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=3, Extend:=wdExtend\n    Options.DefaultHighlightColorIndex = wdTurquoise\n    Selection.Range.HighlightColorIndex = wdTurquoise\n    Selection.EndKey Unit:=wdLine\n    Selection.MoveLeft Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=3, Extend:=wdExtend\n    Options.DefaultHighlightColorIndex = wdTurquoise\n    Selection.Range.HighlightColorIndex = wdTurquoise\n    Selection.EndKey Unit:=wdLine\nEnd Sub\n\n", "Q: flickring 1.5” or 2” column in screen of 17\" macbook pro early 2011 I am using it by mid 2012.\nI was sitting out door for 2hrs at evening and keep working with mac book; and at middle of the screen around 1.5\" or 2\" starts flickering. Sometime it stops flickering and back to normal. I did clear PRAM and NVRAM by pressing option+command+R+P.\nWhat is the problem? and what is solution for it?\nIs that OSX problem or hardware problem or bad graphics? \n\nA: I think there's a replacement program for your model:\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nHere are the affected models:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2011)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012)\n\n*MacBook Pro (17-inch Early 2011)\n\n*MacBook Pro (17-inch Late 2011)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15 inch, Early 2013)\n\n\nI wish 13-inch mid-2012 was included as well, because I have a similar issue.\n", "Q: Can I use Migration Assistant to migrate certain data from different sources? I recently had a hard drive failure (which I now blame on the SATA cable because my SSD became corrupted). I have the stock hard drive that originally came with my MacBook Pro, and I have put it in an enclosure so I can use it via USB. When I restored my hard drive using Time Machine, the computer kept going to sleep despite being connected to power. After about 12 hours being stuck at the same spot, I decided to force shut down the computer and then restart the transfer. When the computer booted back up, all (or at least most, and some data I haven't needed lately) was there. I tried to open the Messages app and it would not open. I reinstalled the OS using the option that would allow me to keep my data, which fixed some errors that the system had been giving me. After researching online, I learned that I should remove the file that stores Messages information (I forget what it was called). My Messages now open, but all previous ones were deleted.\nWhen I get the SATA cable fixed, I want to restore from the Time Machine backup because I still don't fully trust the OS on the hard drive I'm using right now. However, I have other files and messages that have been created that I want to transfer. How should I migrate these files without overwriting any data?\n\nA: When migrating my system I often \"abuse\" the Migration Assistant to import my files to a dummy user. Then I create a second user and copy only the files I really want to the new user. Once I am done I delete the dummy user. This strategy should also help you to get your files together.\nSome other hints that could interest you:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use rsync with the -c command in Terminal to compare files by their checksum. This is a very slow process because every file will be fully read. However, this gives you absolute certainty if two files are identical or not. Using e.g. rsync -anrcv /Volumes/BackupDisk/OSX/Users/me/ /Volumes/OSX/Users/me would print all files that have different checksums, i.e. are potentially corrupted. I sometimes use that when I suspect that a drive has corrupted data.\n\n*You can use caffeinate in Terminal to keep your Mac from sleeping.\n\n", "Q: Do I need Parallels Pro to run Visual Studio? I'm considering installing Parallels to use Visual Studio for my personal use. Can I use the standard $80 version of Parallels? Or do I really need to commit to $100 a year for the Pro version?\n\nA: In general, the pro version offers support for larger memory and more cpu cores. The said VS plugin offers cross-platform debugging and testing, as well as many other automation and command-line support for it.\nThis doesn't, however restrict that you're able to install VS on the virtual machine.\nTherefore it would be possible for your use case.\n", "Q: How do I delete a large amount of photos from iPhoto that were taken on the same device (not sequential) I uploaded a ton of photos from a friend's iPhone before wiping her phone and transferring the photos to a flash drive for her to keep (I use the iPhone for myself now).  But now all of her photos are interspersed throughout my photos on iPhoto and it is very bothersome.  I need to delete all her photos from iPhoto without individually selecting them.  Is there a function I can use to select all photos taken on a certain device before a certain time period or something?  Thank you.\n\nA: Your best bet is to do an advanced search using Spotlight and configure the search parameters accordingly. Spotlight supports device make and model as well as creation date.\n\n", "Q: How can I track application bandwidth usage? I would like to be able to summarize daily network bandwidth usage for running applications. Additional details, such as a sorted list of addresses by traffic usage, would be nice to have as well but not essential. For the most part I just want to know which apps are using the most bandwidth.\nAll of the solutions seem far too detailed or complicated. These include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal applications like nettop\n\n*Commercial applications like LittleSnitch\n\n\nThe closest I've come is use nettop and export its results to CSV. I'm hoping there is something much simpler.\n\nA: Use Activity Monitor\nJust open Activity Monitor (Applications -> Utilities -> Activity Monitor) and navigate to the Network tab. You'll be able to see which apps are sending/receiving data and how much per app/process.\n\n\nA: This is closest thing I can find. For $8 it's a no-brainer.\nTripMode\nThere are some other options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activity Monitor. Too granular and only calculates when it is open. Does have the advantage that individual Safari tabs appear separately and it is very easy to kill a process.\n\n*Peak Hour. Doesn't appear to track specific apps, but it looks like it talks to the router. It might be good for broad network evaluation of traffic usage.\n\n*BitMeter. Tracks aggregate bandwidth use. Includes a nice web UI but no per-app info. Open source. I used this to find which app was using up loads of bandwidth by turning the suspects on and off and watching per minute bandwidth use.\n\n", "Q: Ping is fast but web is slow? I have my MacBook Pro connected to a cell-enabled iPad.  Ping to stackexchange.com is less than 60 ms.  But web pages are taking ages.  A robot detector for a meta question has been there for several minutes, and the checkbox has still not appeared.  \nMail is showing connection errors, as is iTunes.  I don't think it's cell filtering, as various things have worked fine on other occasions.  Maps was a little bit slow downloading imagery but not bad.\nI thought perhaps having both USB and WiFi hotspot might be interfering with each other, but turning off WiFi didn't change anything.\nThe cell signal is poor in this apartment.  But wouldn't that slow down ping by the same percentage as anything else?\n\nA: \nPing to stackexchange.com is less than 60 ms. But web pages are taking ages.\n\nYou're conflating Ping speed and actual download speed, something that can't be done.\nPing (how fast a small amount of data takes to travel) is different than download speed (how much data your computer can get through your router per second). It's download speed that determines how fast websites load, not your ping score (as an aside, a ping as high as 60ms indicates to me that your cellular connection is pretty slow, for me ~10ms comes with fast download speeds on LTE).\nSo how can you find out your download speed? Just search google for what's my download speed (or go to speedtest.net) to measure it. As a baseline, any speed 25 Mbps or faster means the web page will load at a speed I would perceive as \"fast\" and any speed below 2 Mbps is close to unbearable.\n\ntl;dr: Having low ping does not mean websites will necessarily load fast; download speeds determine how fast a webpage will load.\n", "Q: Can you add a pause to a Better Touch Tool macro?

This is done by right-clicking a calendar, choosing 'Share calendar' and typing a user's account name. Alternatively, the calendar can be delegated via the 'Accounts' preferences (Caldav > Delegate > Edit..). However, neither of these actually find any of my server users! The dropdown only shows names from e.g. Mail.\nI've tested with both 'local directory' and 'network directory' users (i.e. with and without Open Directory), but neither show up. Preferably this would work without using Open Directory (as I have no other use for it, and simple is better than complex), but I'd set it up if required. \nWhat does this delegation depend on? How does it do user discovery?\nEDIT: When attempting to do user discovery, I do see the following log entry:\n\"REPORT({http://calendarserver.org/ns/}calendarserver-principal-search) /principals/ HTTP/1.1\" 207 1229 \"-\" \"Mac+OS+X/10.11.6 (15G1217) CalendarAgent/361.2\" i=3 or=1 t=80.2 fwd=<client IP here> unix=true\n\nAnd browsing to /principals (i.e. HTTPS on 443) shows a bunch of stuff, but gives me a permission error when clicking /principals/users.\nEDIT2:\nWhen browsing to https://mydomain/webcal, I can actually add delegates using the web interface! However, it appears that these delegates are 'per user' rather than 'per calendar', and the delegated agendas show up differently in Calendar.app. They do not appear to sync to iOS Calendar at all, either. Not ideal, but closer.\n\nA: This problem started at a client of mine after they upgraded clients from 10.6 to 10.7 and up. Calendar was stable before this. Webcal finds all ldap users, calendar app on clients does not find everyone, and I have yet to find a pattern when who doesn't find someone else. Some cannot find very old ldap users, others cannot find an newly created ldap user. This when creating calendar events and inviting other users. By the looks of it, a bug in the calendar.app in macOS.\n", "Q: Shortcut for Preview sketch tool Nearly every time I open Preview.app I will then immediately press the toolbox button and then the sketch button.\n\nIs there a shortcut to access the sketch tool or some way to put the sketch button on my default toolbar?\n\nA: This workaround applies to Preview.app 9.0 (909.12) in macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and will most likely break in future releases.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch AppleScript Editor and enter the following.\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Preview\"\n    activate\n    set markup to checkbox 1 of toolbar 1 of window 1\n    tell markup\n        if not (its value as boolean) then\n            click markup\n            delay 0.1\n        end if\n    end tell\n    set sketch to checkbox 1 of toolbar 2 of window 1\n    tell sketch\n        if not (its value as boolean) then\n            click sketch\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\n*Launch Preview, open a document, switch back to AppleScript Editor, and run your script.

I erased all content and settings on my iPhone, and the Find My iPhone activation lock was disabled (no activation lock). So ... Why is it still listed in iCloud Settings, Devices? The info blurb on Devices page says that it's listing the devices still signed in. How is this phone still signed in? Is this normal? Is something wrong?  It should be signed out. Maybe it could be listed as an old device ... but not \"Signed In\". I no longer have possession of this phone. I am very concerned for what this means. Worried I did something wrong here.\n\nA: As described in this Apple support document, you should have signed out before deleting the device.  The article provides also alternative methods (in case one has no control of the device).\n\n\n\n*If you're using iCloud and Find My iPhone on the device, sign in to iCloud.com or the Find My iPhone app on another device, select the device, and click Erase. After the device has been erased, click Remove from Account.\n\n\n*If you can't follow either of the above steps, change your Apple ID password.

Even if you have used iCloud's Photo Sharing feature to share 500 of those photos and then decided to delete them from the shared album, those photos will remain in the camera roll unless you delete them from there as well.\nIn a nutshell, any photos taken on a particular device and stored within that device's camera roll will remain stored in that camera roll until they are manually deleted from that camera roll. It is irrelevant whether you have deleted them from a photo stream, a shared album, etc.\n", "Q: How switch to the India store for whatsapp update? I do not want to change my number. i just want to update whatsapp? change from U.S store to India store to update whatsapp without changing the number\n\nA: If you originally downloaded WhatsApp from the Indian store, all you need to do is log into your Indian Apple ID account when prompted (after choosing to update WhatsApp). \nOnce you log in, the App Store will prompt you that the ID only works with the Indian App Store and will then switch over to that store and you can do the update.

I'm worried about them accessing my personal stuff that I have on my iCloud.\nAlso they gave me an iCloud email.. can you even use a iCloud email for iTunes?\n\nA: I would resist the temptation, & would advise them to not make this kind of offer in future.\nTo say this is foolhardy barely begins to cover it.\nThough you having their Apple ID details isn't directly harmful to you, it is not true for them. You would have total access to their data.  \nThey are not giving you a couple of games for free, they are handing you the keys to their entire private life.\nThe only direct harm it would cause you is that should they change their password at any later date, you will never be able to update or reinstall any of the items that used their ID.\n..and that's apart from the fact that you & they would be breaking the terms of your license agreement & basically stealing the software.\n\nA: As long as you do not enable any iCloud services, the other user is unable to access your data. \nHowever, the iTunes Store sometimes locks to an account to prevent things like this and will not let you return to your normal account for a period of 90 days. \nAlso, by sharing apps when you are not supposed to, you are technically stealing a software license, which is technically illegal. You're also cutting into the developer's budget, which is a whole other problem entirely. \n", "Q: Wireless download slow on Bootcamp (Upload is fine) I have the Mid 2015 Macbook Pro Retina 15\" (11,4) and originally installed Windows 10 Pro using Bootcamp assistant.\nI'm having issues with downloading over wireless (no / limited issues uploading), when I try to download any file more than about 1MB it will start off fine (anywhere from 400KB-1.2MB/s) and then suddenly spike down to something ridiculous (usually 15KB/s) and then stall completely but still say it's going at 15KB/s, this is making it pretty much impossible to download any file.\nI have tried resetting my routers configuration, reinstalling windows (I used the media creation tool and brigadier without any issues), reset the SMC and made sure I'm on the most clear WLAN channel and am still experiencing this issue.\nI have also tested to make sure this does not happen on other wireless devices and can confirm my phone is downloading near my downlink speed (~25Mb/s) but my laptop is still spiking around that speed and going straight down.\nThis shows the inital spike up, spike down and halting that I described and also shows that it doesn't happen during upload.\n\nFor comparison here is a test done immediately after over Ethernet.\n\nI also had this issue when I had a mid 2010 MacBook Pro running Windows 7.\nI'll link to some more relevant information below.\n*\n\n*Mobile speedtest: www.speedtest.net/my-result/a/2619288419\n\n*SysInfo Export: pastebin.com/9c6mHQry\n\n*Link speed: ↓ 25,4 Mbit/s // ↑8,2 Mbit/s\n\n*Wireless channels in use: imgur.com/uSzOuL4\n\n*Driver details: imgur.com/q0I8Fgy (Still happens with .49 provided by apple software update and any other versions downloaded elsewhere)\n\n[Sorry about that mess, sadly I don't have enough reputation to post more than 2 links]\nThe wireless NIC is part of the Broadcom BCM43XX series.\nIf anyone has any idea how to fix this that'd be great, feel free to ask for more information if necessary!\n\nA: It appears to be working with a different router now (I was reluctant to test this as my backup router is ISP provided) but I will revisit this if problems persist.\n", "Q: iPad mini 4 restarts itself when shaken Today I just noticed that my iPad mini 4 restarts itself when shaken.

What could be the cause of this problem?\nBTW/ the iPad mini 4 is a 16gb wifi model and running on the latest version of iOS (10.2.1)\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: This is definitely an hardware issue. The first thing I would suggest is to stop shaking it! :)\nWhat ever loose connector you have there might stay loose which will force you to take it to apple \\ local repair store.\nI think it's better to take it for a repair now.

I'd like to know what's the reason for Apple using two different nomenclatures for parts.  \nFor example: an iPhone 6s battery has these two ways to call it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Part Number (APN): 661-00033, this is the one that is printed on the part itself.\n\n*Part Number: 661-04581, this is the one that appears in GSX.\n\n\nWhy doesn't Apple use only one?\n\nA: Here's what I inferred from https://thebookyard.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/apple-part-numbers-explained/ :\nThe APN part number is the part number that refers to a certain version and model of a component. Apparently, this can change based on minor revisions, manufacturer changes (sometimes Apple uses multiple manufacturers), and other things. You could compare this to a lot number of a medicine. Each time a drug manufacturer makes a small change to the medicine, whether it is color or packaging, for example, a new lot number is assigned. In the event of a recall, they can use the lot number to identify the specific batch that is affected.\nThe part number that appears in GSX is a part number that refers to the actual part. This normally stays the same through minor revisions. To continue with the medicine analogy, this could be like the UPC barcode on the bottle. The medicine is still the same (for instance, if Tylenol decided to make a change to their cherry flavor), but slightly different ingredients.\n", "Q: If I move files to a new disk will Time Machine do a full backup? I have a MacMini running 10.12.3 with an internal SSD hosting 2 large iPhoto libraries. I'm going to move 1 of the libraries to a new external SSD (attached to the same MacMini).\nWhat will Time Machine make of this?\nI guess it will treat the moved library on the new external SSD as new and make a full backup? And the backup size for the original internal SSD will shrink given that 1 of the libraries is no longer there?\nReason for asking is I'm wondering whether the first TM run after this library shuffle will be much larger and so will delete a lot of old backups to make space (I've not got much spare space on the backup disk).\n(It would be nice if TM recognised that it's the same bunch of files - just in different places. But that's probably asking too much!)\nThanks for any support.\n\nA: Timemachine identifies backups by the disk's UUID. Therefore, the answer is yes. TM will make a new backup of your files and delete old backups if there is not enough space to hold both copies. \nYou could delete the previous backup of your iPhoto library and then simply do a new backup. However, you will lose your backup history.\nI did something similar a few years ago and I remember that I was able to point TM to the new directory and, therefore, avoid a redundant backup of these files. Unfortunately, I am not entirely sure how I achieved that. This article should get you started with the tmutil utility, which may have the capability to do that.\nA final note as you seem to care about your data. You should not rely on one single Timemachine backup. Especially, if you are going to experiment with sudo and tmutil. After some bad experiences, I maintain two rotating TimeMachine backup disk plus a irregular full copy on a third disk. \n", "Q: How to remove passpoint wifi network on iphone? I'm having this issue on my iPhone where it connects automatically to a certain network (Orange Mobile WIFI). These things are all around town but they do not work at all.

I have a mid-2010 iMac that has regular HDD (not a Fusion drive, just good old spinning disks). Recently, after reboot, I was hearing intensive HDD I/O sounds and firing up Activity Monitor I noticed applessdstatistics process was reading a lot of data.\nI found a way to disable it via Terminal command:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.applessdstatistics.plist\n\nBut the question is: what was the process doing on my computer in the first place?\nDoes it do any tasks that would—nevermind the process name—benefit a regular HDD? Meaning: should I re-enable it?\nI'm on up-to-date macOS Sierra 10.12.3\n\nA: For whatever reason applessdstatistics started appearing for many non-SSD users after the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 update. Apple is aware of the issue.\nAs you've discovered, if you do not have an SSD it is totally safe to disable applessdstatistics with:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.applessdstatistics.plist\n\nAnd no, there is no need for you to re-enable it.\n[EDIT]\nAfter reading the comments I thought I should add some additional info about this issue.\nBased on the advice provided by Apple on 8 February 2017, there are actually two issues that appeared around the same time concerning applessdstatistics. I describe these below:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first issue is the one directly referred to in the OP's question. This is the issue of Macs with only hard drives suddenly having applessdstatistics appear and start reading data from the hard drive (typically in 4GB lots). applessdstatistics is only supposed to run on Macs with a SSD installed, not on Macs with traditional hard drives installed. This issue has affected a large number of desktop users with internal hard drives, primarily older iMacs (although this may only be because there are more iMacs in the field compared to Mac Pros and Mac Minis). I am unaware as to whether it is affecting MacBook models with only hard drives installed (as Little Eden implies in their comment below), but I am aware of the following issue (see 2 below) which could be what Little Eden is referring to.\n\n*The second issue, however, does affect various MacBooks (and other Macs) which do have a SSD installed. The issue is not the presence of applessdstatistics and the fact it is running, but the fact it results in high CPU usage. applessdstatistics has been running in the background of Macs with SSDs installed for a long time without issue until macOS Sierra 10.12.2 was released. However, after this release it has resulted in high CPU usage and, in some cases, a noticeable amount of noise coming from the machine.\n\n\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*The 2nd issue (re high CPU usage and noise levels) is also affecting some non-SSD Macs affected by the first issue.\n\n*It is my understanding that Apple has an open ticket on this issue (i.e. I think it's the one ticket for both issues as they're related) and that a future update will resolve this.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to enable wifi-calling on an iPhone 5 Yes, I know that both Apple and my service provider say minimum iPhone 5c.\nHowever, the 4 and 5 can do facetime, skype, etc, so shoving bits over the air isn't the issue.\nCan this functionality be enabled through a 3rd party app and/or jailbreaking?\n\nA: I used Talkatone on my 5S while out of the country, and it worked pretty well. http://www.talkatone.com/\nThis is a 3rd-party app that will assign you a new number, so it won't \"enable\" WiFi Calling on your phone using your existing phone number. \nWhile FaceTime and Skype do work, WiFi Calling is slightly different. It involves the phone connecting to your carrier's servers through the internet, which for some reason isn't supported on certain devices (especially odd since my 5S is supposed to have WiFi Calling, but AT&T chooses not to support it).\n", "Q: What does the undocumented switch, `-v`, do for `tmutil restore` command? I couldn't find anywhere what the -v switch does with the tmutil restore command.\nAn answer would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The tmutil commands restore verb syntax is:\nrestore [-v] src ... dst\n\nThe use of the -voption produces verbose output during the restore, i.e. additional information about the restore that's not outputted without it.\nAs a side note, tmutil -v will output the version of tmutil.\n", "Q: Reset PRAM in MacMini 3,1 (Early 2009) and now it won't boot at all, but powers on and chimes I was having problems booting to Apple Hardware Test and decided to reset the PRAM. Big mistake; now it won't boot at all. It's a Mac Mini 3,1 (Early 2009) running El Capitan. PRAM reset chimed twice. Now it chimes after power button hit but then just stays at a gray screen forever. Using a wired keyboard plugged directly to USB port.\nI have tried everything I can think of: Reset PRAM again; SMC reset; Safe Mode (Shift key, pre-boot); Verbose mode (Cmd+V); tried to boot to install disk #2 (10.5 DVD, with utilities, currently loaded in drive) for Recovery mode using Cmd+R; replaced PRAM battery; AHT from disk (D key); Choose boot drive (Option key); reseated RAM chip in a different slot; unplugged everything overnight then tried again this morning. \nAll fail. Light comes on, I get dong chime, drive spins for a bit, but then just a gray screen. Any ideas? Thanks a lot. Kind of desperate here. \n[I am aware I should probably buy a new Mac but I'd like to make this one work.]\n\nA: I fixed it. Hail Mary solution was to unscrew and take the cover off the SuperDrive, manually remove Leopard install disk #2, lay install Leopard disk #1 in there (much easier than expected), then power on with C key. (I think it was the second try, I believe I hit and held C before hitting power.) Then I got the Apple logo and was asked if I wanted to install Leopard. I erased the drive and installed Leopard. Booted perfectly after install. Now I'm installing Snow Leopard (from upgrade DVD, which I still had), and afterward I'll install El Capitan by download (the OS I had before). \nIf that didn't work, I was going to buy a new Mini tomorrow morning. It was the last thing I could think of.\nSo apparently the PRAM reset screwed up my HD real bad. Before the PRAM reset I had very recently run disk repair from DVD and from the boot HD and repaired permissions in Terminal (like within 12 hours before).\nIf anyone cares to advise, what's the best way to install a Time Machine backup from my external HD after I install El Capitan? Migration Asst? Recovery Mode? Thanks. \n", "Q: Mac login not working after initial screen Suddenly my MacBook Air won't accept my password.

I can't get past this except as guest so can't get in the Apple menu. Any idea what is going on and what I can do ? Have tried restarting, turning off, logging in as guest, and still locked out.\n\nA: May be the trash became full and not enough memory to bootup. You try boot in target mode , mount the disk in another mac machine and clear the trash.\nor \nIn Recovery mode open \"Disk utility -> repair disk\" may help.\n", "Q: iMac 21.5 late 2013 idle fan speed I recently upgraded my HDD to a SSD. Before upgrading I never checked fan speed.\nNow, after my upgrade the fan spins at 1400 rpm on idle. \nIs this normal? I thought it would be quiet like on a MacBook Pro, with the fan turning on after it reaches a certain temperature. However, it seems to me the fan is now on sooner and because of this my iMac is noisier than before.\nCan someone who has original hdd check fan speed and temperature and post it here?\n\nA: A fan speed of 1400RPM really is nothing to worry about. And your model iMac does not require an external thermal sensor for an ssd upgrade, so that shouldn't be an issue for you.\nMy first step would be to try resetting your System Management Controller. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Unplug it from power\n\n*Wait 15 seconds\n\n*Plug the power cord back in\n\n*Wait for an additional 5 seconds\n\n*Press the power button to turn it back on\n\n\nSoftware option\nYou can also try installing SSD Fan Control to see if that resolves your issue. However, I would only do that if the SMC reset does not resolve your issue.\n", "Q: What are the benefits of earphones with the W1 chip? What are the benefits of Bluetooth ear/headphones with Apple's W1 chip, vs normal Bluetooth ear/headphones?\nAre these benefits restricted to use with iPhones, or will they also apply to Macs and/or iPads?\n\nA: Headphones with Apple's W1 chip will sync between all of your devices using iCloud. That means if you pair W1 headphones with your iPhone, they're instantly available on all your other devices like Macs and iPads. (This requires an iCloud account and macOS Sierra, iOS 10, or watchOS 3.)\nW1 headphones are also easier to pair than their Bluetooth counterparts - simply holding the headphones in proximity of a compatible device and pressing a button will allow the headphones to be paired.\nThese benefits are available on some iPhones, iPads and Macs - though not all devices support them. It's worth noting that even if your device doesn't support the benefits provided by W1 headphones, you can still use them as normal Bluetooth headphones.\nIn addition, the W1 chip also includes a more robust bluetooth implementation that is supposed to provide a more reliable connection and better battery life. This applies when using W1 embedded headphones with non-Apple products.\nAccording to Apple's webpage on AirPods:\n\nIt produces extremely efficient wireless for a better connection and improved sound. And the W1 chip manages battery life so well, you can listen for 5 hours on a single charge.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro takes 10 minutes to shutdown I have a 2016 MacBook Pro 15\", running macOS Sierra, which fails to shutdown properly. Originally when I closed all applications and then went to shutdown, it would take less than 10 seconds to completely power down.\nMy problem:\nNow, when shutting down, applications will close properly, the Desktop turns to a black screen (all normal so far) but then the display will not power down, as the backlight remains on. This lasts for anywhere from 9 minutes up to nearly 20.\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have removed all login items from my user.\n\n*I have done a boot into safe mode.\n\n*I have reset the NVRAM (PRAM).\n\n*I have live-chatted with Apple support and went through clearing the User and System Library/Cache directories.\n\n\nNothing seems to resolve the issue.\nOne point to note is that when I reach the login screen, and choose \"Shut Down\" instead of entering my user password, it will shut-down quickly. I suspect that an application is preventing the normal shutdown, but don't know how to go about finding it.\nI have attempted to look through the console for errors but nothing seems to leap out at me.\nCan someone please suggest a solution, or a means to identify what is causing this issue?\nUPDATE:\nI am just performing the latest macOS 10.12 update to see if that helps at all.\nSECOND UPDATE: After using live chat with an Apple engineer, we have narrowed it down to the Launch Agents / Daemons. We moved most of them to the trash, and I have tried to add a few back in (shutdown, reboot and then attempt a clean shutdown). It could be the MySQL agent. I don't have many others apart from Adobe / Creative Cloud, Google's Keystone and Oracle MySQL.\nNot sure if I should add this as an answer?\nNote: This is not a duplicate as my Mac didn't hang permanently, and the solutions in that question didn't help me in this case.\n\nA: The first thing I would do is reset the System Management Controller. Do this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nOnce you've done that, test for any differences and report back.\nResetting NVRAM\nYou mentioned that you reset the NVRAM. Just in case you weren't aware, resetting this on the late-2016 MacBook Pros is different to all other Macs. The correct process is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote 1: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nNote 2: These steps will also work to reset the NVRAM (or PRAM) for all Macs. However, the late-2016 MBP models actually required the commandoptionpr keys to be held down for 20 seconds, while earlier Macs did not require this, but doing so did not cause any problems either.\n", "Q: Can I \"hot copy\" an entire running Macbook to a new one without using Target mode? Is it possible to copy a running Macbook's state (running Sierra) over to a new Macbook?\nI can't use target disk mode for two reasons: one, I don't have a Firewire cable and am not sure where to get one on my tiny island;  two, the old Macbook is broken: when restarted, it usually won't boot, and I fear it won't boot even into target disk mode. (At the moment, I'm keeping it running until the replacement arrives. Day five so far.)\nThere is a Time Machine backup, but I'm excluding a lot of non-essential files from it. If I added all those files just to transfer everything over, it'd enlarge the overall backup size forever, which I'd like to avoid.\n\nA: \nYou can't clone a fully booted Mac to another completely booted Mac\n\nNot completely accurate.\nA fully booted mac can be copied, in it's entirely, to somewhere else. Use Carbon Copy Cloner (easy) or rsync (Unix guru).\nThe only place \"somewhere else\" cannot be is a booted volume. The hardware hosting the destination can be booted to the desktop, you just need a second partition on the drive and send the clone there.\nYou can also clone to an external drive or a disk image. In your case I would clone the old machine to the external drive that has Time Machine on it (NOT as a disk image), boot the new machine from the external, and clone again. Use Carbon Copy and it will not bother copying files that are already there.\nYou can do the clone-to-external part right now.\n\nA: You can't clone a fully booted Mac to another completely booted Mac. At least some files and folders won't be overwritten because they are in use (e.g. the Mach kernel file).\nWithout some direct connection (e.g. Thunderbolt cable, Firewire-to-Thunderbolt cable, Firewire-to-USB 3C etc.) you are left with either the Migration Assistant or a Time Machine backup.\nYour best bet is to make a complete Time Machine backup, boot the new Mac in Recovery Mode, attach the backup drive and restore the content of your old Mac.\nUsing the Migration Assistant and a network connection is probably rather slow because it will rely on Wi-Fi (assuming that the Wi-Fi chip in the old Mac is not as performant as the one in the new Mac).\n\nA: I haven't tried - but I'd start with Carbon Copy Cloner - http://www.bombich.com or this, which I just discovered today: https://macdaddy.io/duplicate/\n\nA: This is exactly what the free Duplicate is designed for. It adds a copy/paste contextual menu item to the Finder (using Finder Extensions, sanctioned by Apple) which allows anything to be copied and pasted to make a faithful duplicate - even a bootable disk.\nFull disclosure: I am the author.\n", "Q: Output JXA to stdout I have a small script made with JXA (JavaScript for Automation) that outputs a result to the shell with console.log.\nHowever, console.log seems to output to stderr and I’d like to output to stdout. I can always 2>&1 when calling the script, but it would be preferable to output directly to stdout from the script.\nIs there a way to accomplish that?\n\nA: Found the solution: don’t use console.log or anything else. Instead of\nconsole.log('something');\n\nSimply\n'something';\n\nIt will be output to stdout.\n\nA: It may not be the prettiest solution ever, but I think your best bet is to use the Objective-C scripting bridge. The alternative would be to deal directly with the command line and printf, which would probably be even messier.\nUsing the scripting bridge, you can re-assign console.log to a custom function that writes to stdout using NSFileHandle.fileHandleWithStandardOutput. If you put this definition at the top of your program, you can then use this revised console.log.\nconsole.log = function() {\n    ObjC.import('Foundation');\n    for (argument of arguments) {\n        $.NSFileHandle.fileHandleWithStandardOutput.writeData($.NSString.alloc.initWithString(String(argument) + \"\\n\").dataUsingEncoding($.NSNEXTSTEPStringEncoding));\n    }\n}\n\nNote that I've added a line break at the end of each string—you may want to customize this behavior to meet your needs.\n", "Q: How can I password protect files in macOS? I want to start a private journal on my Mac, but I want to make sure that the file can only be opened by me.\nHow can I put password security on my file without it slowing down my computer?\n\nA: Specifically for journalling, you might find it easiest and most convenient to invest in a writing or note-taking app that offers password protection on a per-document basis. Some options include:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacJournal\n\n*Note Case\n\n*Apple's own Pages\n\n*Notes (part of macOS)\n\n\nA: You could put it in an encrypted disk image.\nYou can create an encrypted disk image in Disk Utility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility.\n\n*Go to File > New Image > Blank Image (Cmd+N).\n\n*Enter a filename, and choose a location. You can also choose the size of the disk image. Make sure to set Encryption to either 128 or 256 bit AES encryption (256 bit is more secure than 128 bit, but it's also slower.) You can keep all other settings the same.\n\n*Enter a passphrase for your disk image.\n\n*Ensure you have read/write disk image selected for Image Format (otherwise you won't be able to write to it)\n\n*You can now create the image. Once it's created, the disk image will be mounted. Copy the files you want to keep safe to the new disk.\n\n*Once you're done, eject the disk by dragging it to the Trash.\n\n\nNow, whenever you want to access your encrypted files, just mount the image from wherever you saved it to earlier. Once you're done with your files, eject it as described earlier.\n\nA: You can encrypt any (individual) file using OpenSSL through Terminal.  This is very useful if you are planning on doing a journal in a Word Document, or even a TextEdit file where it's just one long document.  The benefit here is that it's lightening fast as you are only encrypting/decrypting a single file.\nSo, let's assume that on your Desktop we have your Journal conveniently named Journal.txt\nTo encrypt the file, in Terminal issue the command (assuming \"Apple123\" is your username):\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -e -in /Users/Apple123/Desktop/Journal.txt -out /Users/Apple123/Desktop/Journal_encrypted.txt\n\nYou will be asked to type and verify a password to encrypt the file.  When it's finished, you will see the new file on your desktop.  It will look like a regular text file but when you double click on it, you will get an error message that it cannot be opened.\nTo decrypt the file, just issue the command:\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in /Users/Apple123/Desktop/Journal_encrypted.txt -out /Users/Apple123/Journal.txt\n\nYou will again be asked for the password; enter the one you used to encrypt it.  Now, this time, when you double click on the file, you will be able to open your file.\nWhat do those things mean?\nenc - Use encryption cipher\n-aes-256-cbc - Type of cipher to be used.  AES256 is an industry standard.\n-e or -d - Encrypt or Decrypt\n-in - specifies the full path to the input file\n-out - specifies the full path to the output file.\nYou can obtain more info about OpenSSL by typing man openssl from the Terminal prompt.\n\nTL;DR\nUse OpenSSL to encrypt/decrypt.\n\n*\n\n*Encryption: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -e -in [input path/file] -out [output path/file]\n\n\n*Decryption:  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in [input path/file] -out [output path/file]\nRemember your password and make a backup of the file.  If you lose/forget the password you are going to be up the creek without a paddle.\n\nA: For the really paranoid, Keychain Access can be used to store Secure Notes.\n\nA: Further to calum_b's comment, you should take a look at DayOne native Mac app for journalling.  It's full-feautured and has a journal-lock feature.  It's better quality than the products mentioned, in my opinion.  \nIn the next weeks/months they will be rolling out their end-to-end encryption feature.  It's much more practical for a third party to take care of this than attempting it yourself.\n\nA: One can just export as pdf(or other option if suitable) while doing so encrypt it, if its just something you want encrypted not for any further changes and keep on the computer for safe keeping like passwords.\n", "Q: How to complete remove all links to default PHP version?

It can still be used by invoking php5 in a command line. The second command symlinks the new PHP 7 binary to the location of the old PHP binary. Therefore, scripts that use the old location will start using the new PHP version.\n", "Q: iPhone Manual Carrier Selection I have a Project Fi data-only SIM in my iPhone 6 (iOS 10). The data-only SIM allows my GSM-only iPhone (bought with an AT&T SIM) to get service from T-Mobile and would let me get service from Sprint (if my iPhone had CDMA band support.\nWhen I put the Fi SIM card in, the Settings app got a new row called 'Cellular'. In the Cellular menu, there is a single toggle labeled 'Automatic' that defaults to off. If I turn off Automatic Carrier Selection, what will I be able to do? Will my iPhone actually be able to access Sprint? What's going on here, and what's the purpose of the Automatic toggle?\nHere's an image:\n\n\ntl;dr: What does the automatic toggle above control and what will happen if I choose a carrier other than Project Fi?\n\nTo clarify: Project Fi is a MVNO carrier run by Google that allows Nexus and Pixel phone owners to connect to T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular networks under one pay-as-you-go plan. I have my main Fi sim in a Nexus 6P. The carrier also offers data-only SIMs to pop into a tablet or spare phone to give a secondary device data service to the same three networks. That's the data-only SIM I'm talking about here.\n\nA: Your phone will not be able to access Sprint or Verizon networks, because it physically lacks the hardware to do so. The GSM radio in your phone cannot communicate with the CDMA signals that Sprint relies on.\nProject Fi only works with T-Mobile and Sprint. From the list, we can rule out Verizon, Sprint and 310-830 (Sprint), so our only options are AT&T and T-Mobile. You can try connecting to AT&T if you like, it won't break anything - you'll be informed that you can't register to that network. Therefore, your only option here is T-Mobile (probably represented by Project Fi here). In your case, the Automatic toggle will always connect to T-Mobile because that's the only supported network.\nLet's say you could connect to another network on that list, though. Let's say Project Fi supported both T-Mobile and AT&T. Leaving the Automatic toggle on would pick whichever of those networks had a higher signal.\nSo, to answer your TLDR:\n\n\n*\n\n*The automatic toggle connects to the network that a) provides the best signal strength, and b) that you're able to use.\n\n*It won't work. You'll be given an error, or will receive no signal at all.\n\nA: Just a tidbit of info, every iPhone 5s and up is completely unlockable, they all contain GSM and CDMA radios in them. \n(Edit: And most come factory unlocked aside from AT&T)\n", "Q: Open Unidentified .pkg file So I wanted to download the git command line and when opening the .pkg I got an Un ID'd Developer message.\nI do not have admin rights and am locked out of the gatekeeper panel.\nI then tried the xattr -d com.apple.quarantine  method to no avail.\nAny tips?\nThanks!\nNOTE: OSX El Capitan\n\nA: Create a new folder, put the PKG you want to install into this new folder, CD to that directory then run these commands:\nxar -x -f Install.pkg && rm Install.pkg && xar -cf Install.pkg * && open Install.pkg\n(replace Install.pkg with the file name of the PKG file you want to install.)\nThese commands decompress the PKG, delete the original PKG, then create a new PKG, which should install without complaining about unidentified developers.\n", "Q: Why did the runtime on battery drop to 30-50% with a good battery, with no system updates to blame? I have a MacBook Pro 5,1 running Yosemite 10.10.5.\nAfter replacing the battery, it has had excellent runtime on battery for about 6 months. Then the runtime had suddenly dropped by a factor of 2x-3x. The battery still has 95% capacity remaining as indicated by coconutBattery.\nNothing seems out of place in Activity Monitor, there are no apps using significant energy, yet the idle power consumption as indicated by coconutBattery is never below 15W.\nThe runtime reduction did not coincide with any Apple updates.\n\nA: TL;DR:  If SystemUiServer causes about as many idle wakeups as kernel_task and you have iStatMenus, turn off all of iStat's widgets, then turn them back on. If you don't have iStatMenus, suspect other menubar widget applications. The SystemUiServer should have <10 idle wakeups.\nI have another hardware-identical machine running El Capitan 10.11.6, and it doesn't suffer from excessive battery drain. When comparing the Activity Monitor CPU panes, ordered by Idle Wake Ups, the entries are similar, except that the SystemUiServer entry has very low wake-up counts on the El Capitan machine, and 100x higher counts on the problematic system - on par with kernel_task and in 300-500 range.\nA search for issues related to SystemUiServer prompted investigation of widgets installed in the menu bar. On both machines, the additions over stock install are: iStatMenus 5.31, Caffeine 1.1.1 and OS X's Keychain lock.\nUpon disabling all widgets from iStatMenus settings pane, the SystemUiServer became idle. Re-enabling the widgets doesn't bring the problem back. Further checks after a reboot and then after a shutdown-restart cycle show that the problem didn't come back.\nThe battery life is now normal. At idle, with screen at minimum brightness, and google.com open in Safari 10.0.3, coconutBattery 3.5.1 indicates a discharge rate of ~10W.\n", "Q: What is the modern equivalent of \"ps aux\" on macOS Sierra? The BSD backend of MacOS has ps built in. The BSD General Commands Manual says that \n\nThe biggest change is in the interpretation of the -u option, which now displays processes belonging to the specified username(s).  Thus, \"ps -aux\" will fail (unless you want to know about user \"x\"). As a convenience, however, \"ps aux\" still works as it did in Tiger.\n\nI am wondering what the current standard is for this—dare I write—obsolete command+parameter sequence.\n\nA: To replicate ps aux (BSD style) in the AT&T version of ps, you have to use\nps -Ao user,pid,%cpu,%mem,vsz,rss,tt,stat,start,time,command\n\nThis command is compatible with scripts that expect the same output as ps aux.\nThe only difference is the sort order; ps aux sorts all processes by their start time whereas ps -Ao sorts them by PID.\n\nps -jef is a shorter command, but it will output different headers.:\n\n\n*\n\n*USER\n\n*PID\n\n*PPID\n\n*PGID\n\n*SESS\n\n*JOBC\n\n*STAT\n\n*TT\n\n*TIME\n\n*COMMAND\n\n*UID\n\n*C\n\n*STIME\n\n*TTY\n\n", "Q: Yahoo! two-step authentication with iOS Mail and Apple Mail I have recently activated two-step authentication for my Yahoo! e-mail account.

For reasons completely unknown to me the file sharing sometimes gets disabled for some nodes. I could not find a single thing in the logs, but for now I'm trying to write a quick workaround until we can find the issue. \nCurrently I'm writing a script that simply periodically checks if file sharing is enabled, and otherwise forcing it on again.\nA lot can be done with the systemsetup binary, but it can't do anything for filesharing. \nCan anyone tell me either what commandline binary is used to enable file sharing, or which services specifically I need to launch with launchctl?\n\nA: Proper tools in macOS client are sharing and launchctl which have to be run as root:\nCheck man sharing how to use it.\nTo start/stop or load AFP or SMB use:\nsudo launchctl [subcommand] -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.AppleFileServer.plist\n\nor\nsudo launchctl [subcommand] -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\n\n\nThe proper tool to deal with macOS server related tasks is serveradmin which has to be run as root:\nsudo serveradmin -h\nUsage: serveradmin [-dhvx] [list | start | stop | status | fullstatus | settings | command] [<service_key> [ = <value> ]]\n\n  -h, --help     display this message\n  -v, --version  display version info\n  -d, --debug    print command\n  -x, --xml      print output as XML plist\nExamples:\nserveradmin list\n    --Lists all services\nserveradmin start afp\n    --Starts afp server\nserveradmin stop ftp\n    --Stops ftp server\nserveradmin status web\n    --Returns current status of the web server\nserveradmin fullstatus web\n    --Returns more complete status of the web server\nserveradmin settings afp\n    --Returns all afp configuration parameters\nserveradmin settings afp:guestAccess\n    --Returns afp guestAccess attribute\nserveradmin settings afp:guestAccess = yes\n    --Sets afp guestAccess to true\nserveradmin settings\n    --Takes settings commands like above from stdin\nserveradmin command afp:command = getConnectedUsers\n    --Used to perform service specific commands\nserveradmin command\n    --Takes stdin to define generic command that requires other parameters\n\n", "Q: WoL Mac from power-off mode? is there a way to wake the Mac out of a complete power off?

I want to use the fn key on my keyboard as a trigger for an AppleScript (.scpt file) via FastScripts.\nThe reason that I want to do this is because the fn key is occupying coveted real estate on the keyboard, and I don't think I've once used a fn key shortcut in my life.\nI installed Karabiner and went through every option under the \"Change Fn key\" and \"Fn To All Modifiers Mode\" categories individually, to see if FastScripts would be able to pick up on me pressing the fn key and thus allow me to assign the fn key as a script shortcut.\n\n\n*\n\n*FastScripts was able to pick up my keypress when the \"Fn to F14\" option in Karabiner was selected. But, F14 is apparently already in use, because when I pressed the key, my screen brightness setting decreased a notch, which is obviously undesirable.\n\n*FastScripts was also able to pick up my keypress when the \"Fn 2x to F19\" option in Karabiner was selected. But, this obviously requires me to press the fn key, twice in order to start the script. This is also undesirable. \nThese were the only two Karabiner options that FastScripts was able to perceive.\nI am not particularly wedded to using any application in particular (e.g., Karabiner) to accomplish this.\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\nA: You can stop F14 from changing the brightness in System Preferences.\nGo to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Display, and untick \"Decrease display brightness\":\n\nAny integrated brightness keys on your keyboard will continue to function. \n", "Q: Copy files from a hard drive onto an iMac?

This method is probably most convenient, however, as noted in a comment by user Tetsujin: \"[...] unless you migrate as the very first step in setting up a new machine, you will end up with two accounts - the one you just set up & the migrated one. It is possible (if irritating) to merge them, but if the new machine is still pretty much a blank canvas, it could be simpler overall to nuke it & start over.\"\n\n*Boot the old SSD from the USB enclosure by pressing alt during boot and selecting it. Then use a software such as Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! to copy the entire partition.\n\n*Alternatively, you could also use Disk Utility instead of Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! as described e.g. here (edited from the source):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Launch Disk Utility\n  \n*In the sidebar, select the volume to which you want to copy/clone data.

In Activity Monitor, no particular tab process shows high memory usage (not even the youtube ones), only the main Safari process. Closing tabs one by one does not stop the leak, even when all tabs are closed the main process continues gobbling up the memory.

No dice.)\nThanks for any light!\n\nA: Just to cover all bases, I thought I would go through the process you would need to go through in order for this to work. That way you can just do it from scratch and hopefully correct wherever you've gone wrong (or, if it still doesn't work, at least eliminate an error on your behalf as the cause).\nIn summary you will need to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator to create a service that runs an Apple Script\n\n*System Preferences to assign a keyboard shortcut to the service\n\n\nBelow are the steps involved for each. \n1. Create a service using Automator\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (usually found within your Applications folder)\n\n*Go to File > New.\n\n*Select Service and click Choose.\n\n*In the top right hand of the window that appears, ensure that \"No input\" is selected from the Service receives drop-down list.\n\n*Ensure the In drop-down list is showing \"Any application\".\n\n*In the second column containing the long list, find \"Run AppleScript\" and double-click on it.\n\n*This will add the Run AppleScript window on the right.\n\n*Now, replace the ( Your script goes here ) with the script you want (taken from the question you reference)\n\n*Save the service using a meaningful name (e.g. iTunesFade).\n\n\nNow to the next step.\n2. Creating your shortcut\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts.\n\n*Select Services from the sidebar.\n\n*Find your service (it'll be in the list on the right-hand side).\n\n*Add a shortcut by double clicking on the service name.\n\n*Now go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy.\n\n*Select Accessibility in the sidebar.\n\n*Click on the + sign (you may need to unlock the padlock if it's locked).\n\n*Add Automator.\n\n*Add Finder (to find this you will need to navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app).\n\n*Exit your System Preferences.\n\n\nNow you should be able to do two things:\n1. Run the service from any application by going to the Services list within any Application menu (e.g. Finder > Services, Safari > Services, Mail > Services, etc) and select the service you just created. If iTunes is running, the service will fade iTunes in/out \n2. Use the keyboard shortcut to run the service.\nNOTE: I am aware that for some users keyboard shortcuts do not seem to work even though they've been assigned to a service. This is a whole other topic, but if this happens in your case, at least you can run the service from within any application you're using.\nLet me know how you go.\n", "Q: Screenshots and images won't open - Don't have permission to view it \nEvery time I take a screenshot I try to open it, but it says that I don't have the permission.

However, since you have a laptop (MacBook Pro), it's very concerning because if your electric current is cut, your battery will kick in and if that battery gets too low, it will save a hibernation image.  \nThe 0 is as if you had no battery and pulled the plug - the system just cut out.  I would take it in and have a look at it.  This is definitely not normal behavior.\n\nA: I'd give a look at Power Saver panel in System Preferences. It is possible that when unattended, your MacBook doesn't suspend as you expect or wake up for some reason. Or that your battery isn't working as it should.\nLook at these options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Look at battery info on the last line of the panel: if your battery is damaged, it should tell you to replace it.\n\n*Look at Turn display off after option. Try to set it to a short amount of time for both Battery and  Power Adapter, and look what happens when you leave your computer for a while. Does it suspend and wake on your input as you expect?\n\n*Try to disable Power Nap and wait for a night or two. Does you Mac wake as you expect the next morning? Power Napallows the Mac to automatically wake up periodically, to do several tasks. It's possible that Power Napwakes up your Mac for too much time or too often during the night, using all your battery power. \n\n*Click on Schedule button on the bottom left of the window, and uncheck any checkbox. Maybe there's a shutdown scheduled for night time. \n\n*Try to uncheck the Wake for network access option, and wait for a night or two. Maybe some other device on the network wakes your Mac during the night. \n\n\nIt's also possible that one or more preference files that store one these options got damaged, causing some kind of strange behaviour. Just deactivating and reactivating them could be enough to fix them, and restore normal behaviour. \n\nA: I had the same issue with my MB Pro 2013 Retina 13\". It is only with the new hard drive that I put in though. This is what has solved my issue. Be sure to save the settings somewhere, as if your computer SMC or PRAM resets, these settings you define will be lost and you will need to reset these in terminal again. I do believe that the hibernate mode switching from 25(default) to 0(custom) is what solved my issue, however, it very well could be in combination with standby delay and autopoweroffdelay, as I maxed those out as well.

OS upgrades I feel should not be done. Unless doing so offers some great advantage or performance enhancement.\nUPGRADE not updates. Updates within the same OS version should also be done with with the same thinking in mind but with less concern or caution. As far as SHUTDOWN issues, most are software related unless from what I have read and seen in the various complaints all over the web. Most answers I see seem to offer various ways to remedy this via the terminal or console. And other long drawn out ways to check this or remove that or change those and add this... no one seems to troubleshoot the issue as most may not know how or where to start.

Does OS X has an option such as \"select driver\"?\nI couldn't find much related information.\n\nA: It looks like the vendor has named this device \"iPOD\". If your Mac was genuinely detecting your USB flash drive as an iPod, it would appear in iTunes and would also have the correct capitalisation (\"iPod\"). The manufacturer is listed as \"i-FlashDrive\", so it's not unreasonable to think that they'd set the device name to \"iPOD\".\nAs long as the USB flash drive is appearing as a disk, the correct driver has been selected and there is nothing to worry about.\n", "Q: How to Remove Default Web Browser Option I installed Private Internet Access VPN and then uninstalled it with CleanMyMac.

I inherited a Mac OS X 10.8 server that is now only used as a file server.\nWithin the Server Apps settings it has File Sharing, Contacts, DNS, Mail, and Software Update services on.  We have enterprise DNS servers which I configured in the general network adapter settings.  \nWhy would I continue to have DNS service \"on\" if I can rely on enterprise DNS servers to supply DNS routing for this server?  Also, do I need to keep running the Mail service for any reason (e.g. maybe so it can send server notifications, etc)?  And would this be the only reason to run the Contacts service?\n\nA: None of the services (except File Sharing of course) is required. The only thing you have to add are proper DNS server settings in System Preferences > Network > interface > DNS and the Mac OS X server's host name in your enterprise's DNS database.\nFor server notifications you can use any valid email account (e.g. your admin or a special notification/monitoring account) in your enterprise.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro: CAPS always on, Backspace key not working: Faulty Keyboard?

All other keys appear to be OK\n-- Is it likely that only the Shift key and the backspace key developed a fault at the same time - one sticks ON and the other does not work?\n-- probably could only due to a liquid spill - which my daughter would deny\n\n\nWhy do I think the Shift key is NOT physically stuck ON or on due to a foreign body?\nI try a SMC reset 2 different ways:\nBattery not fully charged\nMagsafe light is Amber\na. -- Using built in keyboard - Hold Down (ONLY) Option & Control + Power for 4 seconds and let go.\n-- Amber Magsafe light never changes color\n-- Mac starts normally\n-- If the Shift key is stuck, then I would expect the same as occurs with b. below\nb. Same as a. above but ALSO hold the Shift key\n-- Magsafe light turns green for about 5 seconds\n-- Mac does not start until I press Power or re-try a. above\nThis suggests to me that there is not a physical problem with the shift key\nNow - things that cause more questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repeating B above on external windows keyboard (Shift, Alt (Option) Ctrl) starts the Mac normally, no green light on Mag Cable\nMaybe SMC reset can only be done from the fixed keyboard?\n\n*Have I reset SMC correctly? \nThe change of Magsafe light from Amber to green sould suggest it has worked\nhis page would seem to agree (bottom) https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7633757\n-- But when fully charged the Magsafe light always stays green during the SMC reset\n\n*Have I reset nvram correctly?\nNo timing combinations of Shift, Option, Control and Power will cause the mac to resrart twice\nAlways starts with the recovery screen\n-- Tried both keyboards (note caps lock on fixed keyboard probably prevents nvram reset from working)\n-- Tried holding Shift, Option, Control and Power before pressing power and immediately afterwrds + multiple timing variations of this.\nSo how did I clear NVRAM (and did I) - Thanks to @n1000\nWith the exernal keyboard and a normal startup\nReset NVRAM via Terminal with the command nvram -c\nDid that actually reset NVRAM?\nNo other text displayed in Terminal after nvram -c - so I assume command was accepted.\nI double checked with nvram -xp\nThis displayed a list of 8 to 10 parameters, all end with = and nothing else, so I presume all are empty\nSo back to my original question, do I have a faulty keyboard (one shift key stuck on and one backspace key not working)?\nI have not tried to remove keyboard or keys.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard \n\n*Check the box Show keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar\n\n*In the menu bar click Show keyboard viewer\n\nThis will show you which keys are being pressed and will hopefully help you to answer your question...\n", "Q: Installing macOS 10.12.4 beta 2 breaks OpenSSH installed via homebrew \n*\n\n*ssh: OpenSSH_7.4p1, LibreSSL 2.4.5 (installed via homebrew)\n\n*System Version: macOS 10.12.4 (16E154a)\n\n\nError:\nme@mymac:~$ ssh foo@bar.local\ndyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _arc4random_buf\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/ssh\n  Expected in: /usr/local/opt/libressl/lib/libcrypto.38.dylib\n\ndyld: Symbol not found: _arc4random_buf\n  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/ssh\n  Expected in: /usr/local/opt/libressl/lib/libcrypto.38.dylib\n\nAbort trap: 6\n\nAny advice how to solve this problem?

The message I received was \"First Aid found corruption that needs to be repaired\" with instructions on how to do so. I then restarted my laptop, and lo and behold, it would load up partway and then just shut off. Restarting several times yielded the same results.\nBooting into Recovery Mode once again didn't work -- no option to re-install & verify/repair disk on there was useless. Used Internet Recovery mode which proved just as useless. Booted into single user mode and ran \"fsck -fy\" like last time, except this time I kept receiving \"The volume Macintosh HD could not be verified completely.\" along with Disk I/O errors.\nTried running several variations of fsck_hfs -r /dev/diskxsy to no avail -- kept getting Disk I/O errors & the messages \"corruption was found and needs to be repaired.\"\nBy absolute dumb luck, I came across an obscure fix that worked: https://discussions.apple.com/message/23205771#23205771?ac_cid=tw123456%2323205771\nI followed the instructions there and it finally worked. I immediately ran First Aid again, and received the exact same original error message. Obviously, I am terrified to restart my computer or try anything, so I'm at a loss at what to do, other than make a backup. My SMART status is Verified. Any help appreciated!\n\nA: Based on your other question (which you seem to have posted from a different account) and the circumstances surrounding this one, I feel your hard drive is at very high risk of failure.\nI would immediately make a full backup of your hard drive.\nOnce you've made the backup you should satisfy yourself that all of your most important files have been successfully backed up.\nThen, as a minimum, I would do a full reformat of your internal hard drive. However, when you do so, don't pick the easy option. Instead click on Security Options and use the slider to choose how many times you want to write over the hard drive. No need to pick anything too high, just enough so it's not formatted in only seconds but instead writes over the entire hard drive.\nI suspect that following this process will fail and you won't be able to securely erase the drive. If that's the case, it's time for you to replace the internal hard drive. This is not too difficult (I'd say about medium difficulty) and you can even choose to upgrade to a SSD if you want. \nIf, on the other hand, you can successfully securely erase the hard drive, then proceed to re-install your system from scratch. Afterwards you can restore your data from the backup you made (however, do not delete your backup).\nLet us know how you go.\n", "Q: How to fix paths when iTunes truncated path names after adding music to a folder Alright, so I'm on windows 7 64 bit, but hopefully my question still applies to AskDifferent, considering it is an iTunes issue. I've built a new computer for my girlfriend, and everything went well when transferring her old library. I have one issue. She uses the Keep itunes media folder organized setting on, and it seems that a lot of songs with long names ended up being truncated.\nWouldn't be that big of a deal (despite it being really weird), but we really really want to keep the old playcounts, ratings and paths in each playlist where these songs are used.\nSo the old path is pointing here:\n/D:/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Music/Alix Perez/U EP/1-03 Make It Worth (+ DJ Rashad & DJ Spinn).mp3\nBut for some reason when transferring the music over and letting iTunes take care of it, it managed to turn this file into the following:\n/D:/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Music/Alix Perez/U EP/1-03 Make It Worth (+ DJ Rashad & DJ.mp3\nIs there a way to fix this?\n\nA: iTunes for Windows truncates file names to 40 characters. You'll notice that your original file name (not including directories) is 47 characters and the truncated file name is 40 characters. Why does it do it? I don't know; I wasn't able to find out.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3322627\n\nIf you let iTunes \"Keep the iTunes Media folder organized\" it will use folder and file names with a maximum of 40 characters, inclusive of the extension characters. The following characters are replaced with an underscore.  \\ / : * ? \" < > | and also ; (which is a valid filename character). A leading space or period is also replaced, as is a trailing period for a folder name. Trailing spaces are stripped.\n\nThe author of that post has a script that can consolidate your iTunes library while still keeping your long file names.

How would the UI look like? \n\nA: There are dashboard widgets that offer translation. https://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/travel/languagetranslator.html\nThen I use a hot corner to quickly launch dashboard. It can also be done by a keyboard shortcut. \n", "Q: How to make script out of focus in AppleScript? I have an Automator Service that is comprised of a single \"Run AppleScript\" action. The AppleScript basically consists of a series of dialogs.\nIn the middle of the script, the script relies on keystroking ⌘ command + C in order to get the selected rich text into the script as the clipboard. This copy command must fall in the middle of the script, as the user might want to paste the real clipboard into the initial dialog.\nAppleScript dialogs in Services are by default pinned on top of all windows; you cannot change this.\nAppleScript is only able to keystroke ⌘ command + C when the underlying app is in focus, which makes sense, considering that it is the underlying app -- not the script dialog -- that contains the selected text.\nSo, I'll put my question inelegantly: Is there a way to make the top part of the window immediately behind the Service dialog gray and thus make the top bar of the Service dialog white, while still not moving the script dialog out of view?\nI cannot go by the title of the window or the app of the window, because these variables will vary. The constant is that the window that I want to bring into focus will always be immediately behind the Service dialog.\nThe following is an example of what I'm talking about:\n-- Back up original clipboard contents:\nset savedClipboard to the clipboard\n\nset optionList to {\"Uppercase case\"}\nset dialogBoxChoice to choose from list optionList with title \"Change case of selection\" with prompt \"Choose a letter case:\"\n\n-- Copy selected text to clipboard:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {command down}\ndelay 1 -- Without this, the clipboard may have stale data.\nset theSelectedText to the clipboard\n\n-- Makes the selected text all uppercase:\n-- From: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/171196/184907\nset theModifiedSelectedText to (do shell script (\"echo \" & theSelectedText & \" | tr a-z A-Z;\"))\n\ndisplay dialog theModifiedSelectedText\n\n-- Overwrite the old selection with the desired text:\nset the clipboard to theModifiedSelectedText\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using {command down}\ndelay 1 -- Without this delay, may restore clipboard before pasting.\n\n-- Restore clipboard:\nset the clipboard to savedClipboard\n\nIf you put the above code in a keyboard-shortcut-triggered Service, you will see that the script will fail to tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\" using {command down}; thus, theSelectedText will be identical to the savedClipboard every time.\n\nA: This will do what I think you're looking for.

But still sometimes the MacBook is at 0% battery, even when working with very low CPU load.\nQuestion: Is there a way to find out from which port the MacBook is supplied with power? \nOf course, I could measure the current on the AC side of the power supply, but I'd rather look for a software tool.\n\nA: The current should be displayed in your Power settings menu.\n\n", "Q: Securely erasing all data on iPod Classic so that it cannot be recovered Restoring iPod Classic would not work because it simply erases \"offsets\" to data. Is there any software dedicated to this? Since iPod Classic has many system files on the root, I'm not able to use any kind of software that blow up the whole drive. FYI, I'm a Windows user.\n\nA: Since you're a Windows user I'm not entirely sure how the iPod classic will or won't work in Disk Mode or how your Windows formatting software of choice will see your iPod. However, on a Mac you can securely erase an iPod Classic, so it may well be possible with Windows.\nHowever, in the absence of certainty, why not just fill it up with irrelevant data first? This will force a write over the storage.\nFor example, you could fill it with a whole bunch of music (or anything else really) and after it's full, then wipe it/restore it/etc. Then do with it as you wish in the knowledge that anyone seriously trying to recover the original data (i.e. the data you had on it before you filled it with irrelevant data) will have almost no chance of recovering anything meaningful.\n", "Q: macOS + Windows 10 + shared data partition How can I setup my Mac with three partitions, one with macOS, one with Windows 10, and one data partition that can be used by both macOS and Windows?\n\nA: Disclaimer: Macbook Air + Lion + Windows 7 Boot Camp + shared partition answers a similar question, however with macOS 10.12 Sierra (or later) the therein mentioned step with removing the macOS Recovery partition does not work any more.\nNote: Everything mentioned here worked fine for me for several months. But then I got several data losses on the exFat data partition. Since some weeks, on my MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar, the Touch Bar stopped working properly on macOS, and now it also stopped working on Windows 10, with Bootcamp asking for a restart on every single boot. It was not a hardware failure, as everything is working fine with a clean install with only macOS + Windows 10 (without a shared data partition); I guess it might be related to the unusual partition setup. Thus, in summary, I would no more recommend the method mentioned below.\nSo, I succeeded to have this setup, by having Windows 10 Home (version 1607 Anniversary Update) first on the drive, followed by the data partition and then by macOS 10.12 Sierra. This circumvents Windows' limit of 4 partitions (including Recovery and EFI system partitions).\nSteps for doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup everything.\n\n*In Windows, download MediaCreationTool and set up a USB stick with the Windows 10 installation files. (Note: My Antivirus software blocked the MediaCreationTool from making the USB stick bootable, so I had to temporarily disable my Antivirus software during the setup.)\n\n*In macOS, start Boot Camp, and download Windows support software (via the \"Action\" menu). This will create a folder \"WindowsSupport\". Copy it's content to the Windows USB stick (otherwise you might not be able to use the keyboard and touchpad during the Windows installation). The top folders on the USB should look like this then:\n\n<DIR> boot\n<DIR> efi\n<DIR> sources\n<DIR> support\n<DIR> $WinPEDriver$\n<DIR> BootCamp\n autorun.inf\nbootmgr\nbootmgr.efi\nMediaMeta.xml\nsetup.exe\nAutoUnattend.xml\n\n\n\n*Edit the file \"AutoUnattend.xml\" and remove the sections \"ImageInstall\" and \"DiskConfiguration\" (this is required so that you'll be able to set up your hard drive during Windows installation).\n\n*In macOS, create a bootable installer on an USB stick for macOS.\n\n*Boot your computer from the Windows 10 installation USB stick. During setup, remove all existing partitions and setup your hard drive like this (we need to setup all partitions now, as macOS won't be able to change the partition table later; also note that Windows will also add 2 partitions at the beginning of the hard drive, one for Recovery and one for EFI system):\n\n\n*\n\n*First partition with NTFS (for Windows).\n\n*Second partition with exFat (for shared data).\n\n*Third partition with exFat (for macOS).\n\n\n*When Windows is installed, run \"Apple Software Update\" to install updates for Boot Camp.\n\n*Boot your computer from the macOS installation USB stick. During setup, open Disk Utility from the utilities window, then use Disk Utility to erase the last partition using the Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format. Then install macOS into this partition.\n\n\nYou will no more be able to change the startup volume in macOS' preferences. But within Windows, you can use the Boot Camp manager to set your preferred startup volume, and of course you can hold ALT during startup to choose the system.\n", "Q: ssh command crashes after key exchange Had this strange issue crop up today that I haven't experienced before.

I would like to know if it is safe to upgrade from Yosemite to Sierra, with Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 (version 14.7.1) installed. Will I have to reinstall it again, or is it safe and there are no worries?\n\nA: What I can tell you is that Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 does indeed work in macOS Sierra. \nI've also just done a check on its Roaring Apps page and up to version 14.6.8 was confirmed as working in macOS Sierra. While this is not the version you quote (14.7.1), Microsoft typically provides updates to improve compatibility with the OS, so your more recent version will work fine.\nAs to whether you will have any issues because you're upgrading directly from Yosemite to Sierra, no-one can give you a 100% guarantee as every system has its own quirks (depending on configuration, installed software, connected hardware, etc). However, your current installation of MS Office should still work fine after the upgrade.\n", "Q: macOS Terminal autocompletion suggestion I'm looking at a video and the Terminal in WebStorm looks like this\n\nAs you can see there is an autocompletion suggestion while he's writing the command.

I would like to have the suggestion.\n\nA: This screenshot looks very much like the fish shell. This is an alternative shell to bash. One of its core features is smart auto-completion. \nAlternatively you could use homebrew to install auto-completion for bash:\nbrew install bash-completion\n\nYou will have to press tab to complete the command you are currently typing.

How can this be fixed?\nP.S. I searched for previous posts about this problem and could only find \"Fetching...\" Behavior in Finder \"Open With\" Menu in Yosemite but that is more about Finder taking a few seconds delay for the pop-up menu to appear, while mine doesn't appear at all.\n\nA: It might be time to rebuild your LaunchServices database.\nYou will need to reset any custom associations.\nThe simplest method to do this is using Onyx (freeware).\nMaintenance tab/Rebuilding\n\n", "Q: MacBook Air CPU core PECI temperature I have a question about my MacBook Air CPU temperature. I've read a lot of similar questions but there's something I can't understand in my experience. \nI'm doing some tests because I'm trying to figure out whether my computer would endure a live streaming of 12 hours (it's a school music project). When I run Wirecast the first time CPU core PECI temperature (which I monitor with iStat menus app) gets really high (80°-99°), then I get scared and I tried to stream at a lower video resolution and it seems it works... I mean, fan runs at a very low speed or doesn't run at all and the CPU (if I don't touch anything and leave the computer streaming only) gets a reasonable percentage of about 50%. But there's something strange... the temperature \"CPU core PECI\" it's still about 80°C-95°C! but if I open up the iStat menus menu the only red-written temperature is \"camera proximity\" with 64°C.\nDoes anyone of you know what's going on? Do you think it's dangerous for my computer to make this live streaming? \n\nA: Here are some things to keep in mind for your streaming event. \n\n\n*\n\n*If the CPU gets too hot, the MacBook will throttle and reduce clock speed. That could result in dropped frames. Most of the time you will hardly notice the difference. \n\n*iStat Menu has a utility to override fan speeds. In your case I would consider cranking up the fan to full speed during the streaming event, unless the noise is an issue. \n\n*During the event put something underneath your MacBook so air can circulate below it. That doesn't do miracles but results in 1-2 degrees less and therefore less risk of throttling / dropped frames. \nMacs have pretty sophisticated cooling design and CPU temperature is not the only aspect taken into account for controlling fan speed. I would suggest you do another dry run for 2-3 hours. If you don't have issues during that time 12 hours should work as well. \n\nA: It seems as if streaming is using your Mac's CPUs. Not really surprising. High temperatures are not really bad for the computer, as long as they can get consistent cooling. So make sure the vents on the Mac are free and clear, perhaps proving the machine up to make sure it has free flow of air.\nRest assured that if your computer gets too hot, it will simply shut down. Therefore the only way to know if streaming is 'too much' for your computer is to give it a go...you won't harm it.\nYou may find that the Air is not appropriate for what you want, perhaps you would be better off with a desktop mac or even a PC with huge amounts of cooling available.\n\nA: Your macBook Is not running fans at max speed so that it it as silent as possible. If you want to get the best performance with no thermal throttling, you should get a fan control software (\"Macs fan control\" works well) and run the fans at max manually. You should keep in mind that charge % will decrease faster this way so you should keep it plugged in\n\nA: mine goes up to 200 sometimes.  I run a fan outside, a cooling fan below.  I have a USB that hooks to 6 External Hard Drives with over 2 TB of space.  I have 4 computers - 2 Macbook Pros and 2 Windows based machines.  If I turn it all on at the same time it will heat the room up.  I use fans to keep the temperature at the best I can.  I don't usually have all of them on at the same time.  I use each one for a different task.  One to run disk drives (on all the time), One for development, etc  I agree with the above - you may need a gaming PC that has lots of cooling.  I am the same but grew gradually.  Like I said - a few Honeywell fans make a lot of different.  Less than $20 a piece.'\n", "Q: Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 and Thunderbolt Display I just bought this Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter  for my new MacBook Pro (2016) to connect it to my old Thunderbolt Display, but realized that none of my USB ports or Thunderbolt port work (so no daisy-chaining).\nIs it something wrong with my setup or is this connectivity not supported by Apple's official Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 solution?\nThis does not sound like \"to Thunderbolt 2\" adapter to me, since it only supports multimedia.\n\nA: Connecting 2 Thunderbolt displays using daisy chain with the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 didn't work for me until I upgraded to the latest Sierra build. (10.12.13) now everything is working as it should. If upgrading didn't work for you I suggest that the adapter is faulty. \n", "Q: How much space does macOS Sierra take? I have a MacbookAir 11\" from 2011, with only 64 GB of disk storage. Originally came with OSX Mountain Lion and now I'm thinking on updating it to macOS Sierra.\nMy question is: How much space does the macOS take? Will it take most of my storage space only for the OS? Or will I have enough space to work with?\n\nA: A clean install of macOS Sierra 10.12.3 from a USB Flash Drive takes a little less then 10 GB of space. If you do an in-place upgrade the Install macOS Sierra.app bundle takes a little less then 5 GB but can be deleted if after the upgrade it doesn't self-delete. So, you have plenty of space whichever way you choose to go. (The in-place upgrade method is assuming you have adequate free space  to preform the in-place upgrade.)\nAs always with an OS Upgrade, make sure at the minimum that your user data is backed up, if not the entire system before performing the upgrade. Time Machine is a good way to maintain backups of the system.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro shuts off on battery power with new battery I recently replaced the battery on my Early 2009 MacBook Pro as I was having issues with it shutting off without warning when running on battery power. However, this hasn't resolved the issue and it continues to only work when plugged into AC power.\nI've reset the SMC multiple times, PRAM and all the other basic things as far as I know, so suspect it may be a short on the logic board or something along those lines. I also tried unplugging all connectors from the main board other than those absolutely necessary and seeing if it still shut off on battery, which it did, so don't think it's anything to do with ports, keyboard, optical drive, etc.\nWhat ways can this be fixed? Will it have to be a straight replacement of the logic board, or is it possible to track down a short and resolve it?\n\nA: You’d really need to have current / voltage probes to tell where the fault lies. In a shop with resources to order test parts, you’d still try a second battery before doing a logic board swap if you don’t have the tools or skills or documentation to diagnose the precise voltage levels in and out of the power transformer(s) that are driven by the battery. \n", "Q: How can I use a 5\" screen as a display for a Mac Mini?

Check the share name, then retry.\n\nLooks like the first user is used for the second mount command.\nI don't think it's an AFP limitation (is it?), so there may be another way to mount those shares?\n\nA: You can't login to the same Netatalk (AFP)1 server with two different sets of credentials. This is why you are are seeing the result you are seeing.  \nWhen you log into AFP server, there is a 1:1 relationship between the client and the server.  This is why your client is able to browse and find all of the available shares under that login.  It won't allow you to log in again because you would have to break the existing connection first.  However, you can log into a different AFP server.\nThis is also why Fast User Switching doesn't work when your home directories are stored on the network.\nYou have two options to resolve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the shares/resources available to the user you want to log in with (Recommended)\n\n*Create another Netatalk server instance.

Can the same be done on a MacBook with Bluetooth network + Wi-Fi?\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, the example you're using about your Samsung phone having a setting that allows it to use 4g + Wi-Fi to increase speed in certain circumstance is the same option iPhone users have (Settings > Mobile > Wi-Fi Assist). It's primarily to allow the use of mobile data when Wi-Fi connectivity is poor.\nThe key thing about this option is that in both cases (Samsung / iPhone) we're talking about a data connection to the internet (i.e. 4g and WiFi). What I mean is that both 4g and Wi-Fi can connect independently to the internet.\nWith regard to your question though, you're talking about Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The thing is that Bluetooth in and of itself does not have a data connection to the internet - so it's not like it can assist to increase speed because it isn't connected in the first place.\nDevices (Macs and iPhones included) can share their already connected internet connection via Bluetooth to other devices, but no you can't use both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to increase an existing internet connection.\nIf I've misunderstood your question, please let me know.\n", "Q: Why do fields turn black when using Preview to duplicate or print some pdfs?

But I am wondering how can he disable the them if it's locked with a 6 digit code?\n\nA: Macbooks don't have GPS chips, so they have to rely on less accurate information - namely, triangulating a position from nearby Wi-Fi's.\nWhile that works great in many cases, there's no guarantee it will. If no Wi-Fi networks are in range, a Macbook may not be able to gauge a position at all.\nIf the E-Mail pointed out the IP address it was sent from (I've never used this service so I don't know how it works) law enforcement may be able to do something with that - but chances are probably slim, as an IP address can be used by many people at the same time.\n\nA: It sounds like your mac was turned on for just enough time to send out a mail but was turned off before it could send out location. Unfortunately locked devices can still be turned off.\n", "Q: Has the step counter been recalibrated with iPhone 7 or iOS 10?

The new version of the coprocessor is likely to account for these errors in step counting.\nIn addition, this step counting is really only supposed to be an estimate. If you want an actually somewhat accurate step tracking solution, you should go for a dedicated wearable device, like a FitBit or Apple Watch. \nThe motion coprocessor is simply a gimmick to match competitors' phones.\n", "Q: Prevent Spotlight from indexing external drive Sometimes I use an external drive with macOS on it. This is in conjunction to my current internal drive which also is running macOS.\nI find it annoying that, whenever I search for something (such as an application) when I'm in either OS when the external drive is connected, I get results from both my external and internal drive. However, I am only interested in running the application from the drive I've booted off of. \nI tried circumventing this issue while on my external drive by creating a Spotlight exception for internal drive. This prevented files and apps from my internal drive from showing up. However, this also prevents me from searching for files on my internal drive, when I'm booted off my internal drive! Clearly this is something that I don't want. \nIt seems as though the Spotlight exclusions are per drive, which is not ideal in this scenario.\nIs there a way to make Spotlight index only the drive which is currently booted? In this way when I'm booted off my external drive I'll get results only from the external drive, and same with the internal drive. \n\nA: I use mdutil command to prevent indexing on external drive, I feel that is more reliable.\nTo check if the external drive has indexing enabled or not, run the command:\n$ mdutil -s /Volumes/<VolumeName>\n\nIndexing enabled. \n\nTo disable indexing, run the command (require user password):\n$ sudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/<VolumeName>\n\nIndexing disabled.\n\nYou can recheck the indexing status with the first command again:\n$ mdutil -s /Volumes/<VolumeName>\n\nIndexing disabled.\n\n\nA: I learned today that you can use a sudo touch /.metadata_never_index_unless_rootfs  in the root directory of each drive to separate Indexes from OS X Boot-Drives. It is a special version of .metadata-never-index, because it will (re)index the drive when you boot from it, but not when you don't. \n\nA: You could have a script that runs at startup that employs the technique suggested in this post https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/91759/183505\nWhen booting from DriveA (when you want to disable spotlight indexing for External DriveB) you could execute :\ntouch /Volumes/DriveB/.metadata_never_index\n\nWhen booting from external DriveB and you want to re-enable spotlight perhaps you could have your startup script execute:\nrm /Volumes/DriveB/.metadata_never_index\n\nThe linked post also lists other ways to programatically alter the spotlight exclusions.\nHere are some ways to add a script that will launch at login : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6442364/running-script-upon-login-mac\nGood luck!\n\nEdit : Method using bash scripts and plist files\n\nFirst create a startup script.

They offer the same functionality, including push.\niCloud Drive is supported through the File Sharing service.\n﹅ Partial support\nReminders and Notes are supported in macOS once you add the service separately in Internet Accounts. Your mileage may vary with Reminders and Notes in iOS.\nSafari is unsupported, but you can use the file sharing feature to sync symlinked Safari preferences on macOS. This is not possible for iOS.\nKeychain sync requires you to sync a keychain using the File Sharing service on macOS. This is not possible for iOS.\niCloud Backup is unsupported but you can use iTunes Wi-Fi Sync to sync to iTunes when on the same local network.\n✗ No support\nNews, Home, Wallet is unsupported, but you can still use each of those apps locally, there's just no synchronisation between devices.\nFind My iPhone is managed separately and still requires Apple's servers, even though you don't technically need an Apple ID or to be signed in to iCloud.\n", "Q: Do iPhone battery extenders reduce regular battery life? During heavy use periods, my iPhone 6 battery doesn't last the day. I'm looking at the battery cases available and curious if these actually reduce the life of the resident battery? \nMy understanding of rechargeable batteries was that they should be allowed to run down, and then fully charge. But that belief may be based on NiCad technology, and the newer LiOn may not have this issue. \nIt seems that if the phone has such a charging case, the case will function the same as just leaving the phone plugged in and 'topping off' the charge. \n\nA: In theory, no. Battery extenders work just like a charger. The main problem with these extenders, assuming you are not buying some top notch apple certified extender, is the different random voltage they output and that can seriously damage your battery and device.\nIf you are getting a battery extender I would recommend getting something that is apple certified or at least branded from a known company. Stay away from all the knockoffs AliExpress garbage. \n", "Q: Is it possible to see an ad for Tinder on lock screen if Tinder is not installed? An ad for Tinder appeared on lock screen of BF's phone. Says he doesn't have the app but did he used to? I know I only get ads/pop up notifications from existing apps. \nI'm not tech savvy enough to know. \n\nA: It's possible to get text messages from a service after deleting the app, but if the notification is branded like the app on the lock screen (with the logo), then the app is still on the device. It's not possible to get those kinds of notifications without the app being currently installed.\nYou can search for apps from the home screen by swiping down. That should allow you to search for the Tinder app by name, instead of browsing around for it.\n", "Q: Testing a website using Safari on Linux I run linux and use virtualbox to cross browser test my website. I have Windows10 and Windows7 within virtual box which allows me to test the site with IE and Edge browsers.\nI have never used Apple/Mac OS so I am very much in uncharted territory here. I need to test the site on Safari but after searching online, it appears as though it isn't possible to download a MacOS ISO to install in virtualbox: link (I do not have access to an apple computer)\nI tried installing Safari on a windows VM but it is a really old version since Safari is not supported on Windows. Also, from what I can tell there are no Linux versions of Safari.\nIs there a way to test the site using Safari somehow without owning a Mac?\n\nA: Simple answer would be No - there isn't. But there are some workarounds.\n\n*\n\n*Use inline service like browserstack\n\n\n*Use old (unsupported) version of Safari on Windows\n\n\n*Use browser which seems to have similar rendering engine:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome web - installed by default on Ubuntu\n\n*Midori Browser - Since 2019 Midori is based on Electron (Chromium)\nFor me going 3) helped to debug most of Safari rendering problems, so I can only recommend Gnome Web and Midori browser.\n\nA: Safari is based on the WebKit rendering engine, though is of course exclusive to Apple hardware. Chrome, before forking its proprietary Blink rendering engine, was using WebKit so that is a somewhat close comparison.\nThe download page on the WebKit website links to a GTK port for Linux which might be enough to serve your purposes.\n\nA: While it's not entirely the same thing, you could use one of the WebKit Linux ports to run \"mostly Safari\" on Linux. However, if you're intent on running macOS on non-Apple hardware, there are ways. However, note that these methods may violate Apple's macOS SLA.\nAccording to Apple's macOS 10.12 SLA, you may use your limited, non- transferable, non-exclusive license:\n\nto install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances\n  of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments on\n  each Mac Computer you own or control that is already running the Apple\n  Software, for purposes of: (a) software development; (b) testing\n  during software development; (c) using macOS Server; or (d) personal,\n  non-commercial use.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, there's nothing that would prevent you from running a VM on non-Apple hardware, though you would clearly be in violation of the SLA, and as such, I can't recommend you do this. However, if you decide to run a VM on Apple hardware, it's possible to create a compatible ISO. In any case, you'd need access to a macOS equipped machine.\nAgain, while clearly in violate of the SLA, there are methods to put macOS on non-Apple hardware, generally known as Hackintoshing. Again, I cannot condone this, but it is technically possible.\nThe easiest and most legally clear method is still to run Safari on Apple hardware, and that's what I'd recommend. \n\nA: As @TomSaleeeba said i tried epiphany and i am seeing errors reported to me (which I wasn't seeing on firefox or chrome) by a client on my linux ubuntu 18 pc. I hope this can help someone else down the line trying to debug safari web issues\n\nA: I had great success by using the macos-virtualbox script. It sets up a VirtualBox machine and magically downloads and installs MacOS in it. It took a great amount of time and disk space, but in the end I had MacOS running without needing access to any Apple device or to enter a license key.\n", "Q: 4k screen can handle 60hz 90° rotated, but not in 0° I've run into this funny issue, where I've got a 4k monitor (Samsung U28E590), that I'm trying to optimize for resolution and hz-frequency. My optimal goal is of course 4k, with 60hz, but since I don't currently have a Thunderbolt to Displayport cable, I thought I'd give it a go with a HDMI-adapter for my Thunderbolt port.\nNow I've run into the issue of not being able to choose 60hz for frequency on the screen when I've selected anything else than 2560x1440px. Not even in 1920x1080, am I able to choose anything else than 24, 25 and 30hz. \nI then discovered, that if I rotate the screen 90°, I get a different settings-layout, where I'm able to choose between not resolutions, but the regular 'more space' or 'larger text', as I have on my regular retina screen.\nHas anyone experienced this before, or is this some kind of bug with either the display, or MacOS?\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS 10.12.2\n\n*MacBook Pro Retina, 13 inch, Mid 2014 model.\n\n*8 GB Ram\n\n*Intel Iris graphics\n\n\nA: Your model MacBook Pro has an Intel Iris 5100 GPU that uses up to 1.5 GB of your main RAM as its graphics memory. It supports an HDMI-compatible device, including 4K, while using one Thunderbolt display, or supports two Thunderbolt displays. \nIn terms of external resolution, officially your Mac can display up to 2560x1600 pixels (using Thunderbolt) or up to 3840x2160 pixels at 30Hz or 4096x2160 pixels at 24Hz (using HDMI).

MacWorld has a pretty good guide, but I'll skip some of it in favor of just downloading MalwareBytes Anti-Malware and letting it do it's job in case some other stuff got installed as well. Let it run, and once it's done, if there are any remaining traces, quit any relevant process and move them to the trash and empty said trash.\nIf you absolutely need to close it though, you can force quit the installer or kill the process. You can force quit by right clicking the icon in the dock with alt held down, then clicking force quit, or through a menu accessible via  -> Force Quit (accessible with the shortcut Command + alt + esc.) You could also use the command-line command kill or killall to kill the installer process.

I tried to update my old MacBook Air from OS X 10.8 to the newest El Capitan. However, now (directly after the installation) when I boot it up the loading bar will stop at 100% and nothing happens.\nThen I wanted to reinstall OS X (10.8) but it says that it can't install an older version of OS X. \nNow I'm really tempted to wipe the SSD but I'm worried that if I completely wipe the SSD it won't be able to do anything with the MacBook since it doesn't have a recovery partition.\nIs it safe to wipe the SSD?\n\nA: If your Mac shipped with OS X Lion or later, you'll be able to use Internet Recovery - in which case it's safe to fully erase your SSD, as your Mac is capable of fetching the recovery partition over the Internet.\nYou can enter Internet Recovery by holding Cmd+R during boot.\n\nA: It is completely and totally safe to wipe the SSD, as long as you're ok with installing a newer version of macOS, and are able to use a different Mac.\nYou'll need an 8GB USB drive that you're willing to wipe and a different Mac running 10.6.8 or later.\nFirst, download the macOS [any version] installer from the app store on a different Mac. \nWhile you wait, open Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility on the other Mac. Insert the USB drive. Select he USB drive and press Erase.\nHere are the options you need:\n\nOnce the download finishes, there are a couple different steps you need to take depending on your version you downloaded.\nThe following directions are for Sierra.\nOpen Terminal and enter the following. It is a sudo command so you'll need an admin password to execute it.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Sierra --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app --nointeraction\n\nIt'll take about 5 minutes.\nOnce that finishes, plug the USB into the (powered off) target Mac. Hold down alt/option as you turn it on.\nSelect your USB labeled Sierra using the arrow keys on your computer. \nNow, you have the recovery partition open. Yay!\nIn the menu bar, open Utilities -> Disk Utility\nSelect the drive labelled Macintosh HD, and click Erase. Use the same options from the USB above, but name it Macintosh HD.\nFinally, quit Disk Utility, and select Install Sierra. Once that process finishes, you're done.\nThe end.\n", "Q: iOS hotspot + VPN behavior I routinely use the Personal Hotspot feature on my iPhone.\nRecently, I have set up a personal OpenVPN server (per here) to use with my phone. However, I don't seem to be able to use both at the same time - which I would like to do so any devices that connect to my phone's hotspot go through the VPN, too (for a few reasons - not least of which is to leverage the pihole server I run for ad-blocking/etc).\nIs this possible? Have I just done something incorrectly during VPN creation?\n\nA: As of iOS 11.2.6, if using the Personal Hotspot feature, any devices connected to the hotspot will show whatever the phone's public address is (eg from Verizon Wireless).\nInterestingly, the phone will show that it is connected to the VPN.\nIf you run a web-based IP check, the phone will display the VPN's address (as expected), but connected devices will have the non-VPN address.\nFor example, your iPhone might display 44.33.22.11, because it's where the VPN is, but the laptop may show 77.55.33.11 because that's what the phone has for an underlying IP.\nI don't know why this is - but it is what it is.\n", "Q: How can I tell which device purchased specific apps? I have had a problem with children downloading apps. I would like to be able to see which apple device has purchased which app. How do I do that?\n\nA: Sync your iPhone to iTunes, Select the App you want to know from which account it has been purchased, right click, go to Get info, under the File tab you will find something like below image where you can see who purchased the app. I have removed my Apple ID but the different names is for different accounts.\n", "Q: Why am I having trouble entering a new Gmail password in Mail (and Internet Accounts)? I'm required to change my school Gmail password every year.  I recently did so, and it seems to work just fine for accessing Gmail with a web browser.  It also works fine in the Mail app in iOS (I was asked to enter the new password, but it accepted it just fine).  However, in the Mail app on macOS, I've run into some issues.  It shows a \"Login Failed\" message on the top right of the window as well as the telltale lightning bolt \"offline\" icon to the right of the mail in the left sidebar.  I totally expected to see both of those, since Mail is trying to access the account using the old password.  But I can't get past that.  If I click on either of those, it opens a dropdown/popup where I can enter the password:   That's all good.  After I enter the password, though, I see a \"loading\" animation (a spinning-type one) for a brief second and then just blank gray in the window:   The same thing happens if I try to do this in the Internet Accounts section of System Preferences.\nDoes anyone know why this is happening and how I can resolve it?\n\nA: I had this issue recently. There are some answers here, but what worked for me was I had to sign out of my iCloud account first. Add/Update the Google password (should now work) then sign back into iCloud.  \n", "Q: IPod touch location services A box popped up that says \"Turn on location services to allow weather to determine yor location\".  There are two tabs underneath that say \"settings\" and \"cancel\".  Neither of the tabs work the box won't go away.  I can't get it to shut off.  It's just stuck.\n\nA: Do a hard restart:\nHold the home button (the round one at the bottom) and the sleep wake button (the one on the top or the right side of your device) for 15 seconds or till the apple logo shows up.\nIf it does not appear, try to check if the device is still on, then try again, if it's off hold the sleep wake button.\n", "Q: How do I do \"Hey Siri\" on Mac? On iOS, you can activate the Hey Siri feature in Settings and call out \"Hey Siri\" at any time to activate Siri without pressing a button. How can I do the same thing on macOS?\n\nA: You can use Dictation for this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings and enable dictation in keyboard settings. Make sure to check \"Used Enhanced Dictation\"(you may need to download something)\n\n*Go to Settings > Accessibility > Dictation(under interacting)\n\n*Check \"Enable the dictation keyword phrase\" Enter whatever you want in the text box underneath it. To use \"Hey Siri\", type \"Hey\" in the box.\n\n\n*Click on \"Dictation Commands\"\n\n*Check \"Enable Advanced Commands\"\n\n*Click on the plus that appears.\n\n*Now fill it in like this:\n\n\n*If you want (and I recommend you do), uncheck all the other boxes as you might accidentally activate one of those commands without meaning to.\n\n\nSource\n\nA: Once enhanced dictation is enabled, all that needs to be done is enable Siri in your system preferences\n\nThere is no need to add an additional dictation command because the dictation command is already there set up and ready to go in the \"System Commands\"\n\nIf you want to use the phrase \"Hey Siri\" to launch Siri on the computer, creating a new command is an option. The only problem with that is, what if your iPhone and computer are sitting close together? Using the phrase \"Hey Siri\" will launch Siri on both devices. My thought is that it is probably a good idea to use different commands for each device\n", "Q: iPad Retrieve a passcode to activate IOS 9 I need a passcode to activate IOS 9. I don't recall acing a passcode. Is there any way I can retrieve an old passcode or set up a new passcode? It has to be 4 digits. I made 1 wrong attempt and may be shut out\n\nA: The passcode is either an activation locked device or can be restored from iTunes. If you don't need to make a backup or get the data, connect to iTunes and erase and restore. \nIf you do need the data, be organized trying pass codes until you give up and erase the device. \n", "Q: How can I stop losing my screens when I close the lid? When I close the lid of my MacBook Air, it's almost always plugged in.  When I open the lid, I have to sign in and my screen is clear of all the things I wanted to see or was looking at, but did not finish.  This happens several times a day.  I have to close the lid because of a possible dust situation where I need to keep the computer during the day.  This just started happening a couple of weeks ago.  I am running OS X El Capitan.  I do not log out, but it thinks I did.  Grrrrrrr!\n\nA: Sounds to me like the cause of it is this setting, which you'll want to disable:\nSystem Preferences > Security & Privacy > \nRequire a password X minutes after sleep or screen saver begins\n\n\n", "Q: Apple family sharing from iOS to Mac Can I initiate Family Sharing from my apple ID on an iOS device as the organiser to another account on my Mac so that latter can have the possibility to share the iWork apps i have on my iOS device without buying them from the Mac Store?\n\nA: Sure you can.\nYou can set your preferred account as Organiser, with Share my purchases switched on, then invite & add your other account as an Adult (you could set yourself up as a child, but then you'd have to ask yourself permission ;)\nFrom System prefs > iCloud > Manage Family...\nFirst & last are 'me'\n\nOne caveat - you need to make sure that the two addresses aren't already associated. I had great difficulty figuring out why adding my second account wouldn't work. It turned out to be [iirc] that each was using the other as the rescue or secondary email address.\nAs you're setting it up initially you need two devices [or accounts on a Mac] each to be signed into its own account. It took some juggling for me to set this up on a single Mac, but between iPhone & Mac ought to be simpler.\nFull setup details at Apple KB: Set up Family Sharing\nI'm not sure whether doing this will enable the right to the Mac version of an iOS app. It usually wouldn't, but the iWork suite & Apple's own software in general seems a bit of a special case.\n", "Q: iTunes purchase charged to credit card instead of voucher I recently set up Family sharing.  My son purchased a game from Apple thinking he was using his iTunes voucher but the purchase has gone straight on to my credit card via family sharing.  How can I rectify this?\nthanks\n\nA: If you've properly setup Family Sharing, then any purchases made by the family should deduct from the iTunes gift card (assuming this is what you mean when you say 'voucher') instead of your credit card.  According to this Apple product page:\n\nAfter you set up your family, any time a family member initiates a new purchase it will be billed directly to your account, unless that family member has gift or store credit. First, their store credit will be used to pay the partial or total bill. The remainder will bill to the family organizer's card. As the family organizer, any receipts generated by the transaction will be sent to you.\n\nIf you see that your card is being charged instead of the gift card, contact Apple iTunes Support.\n", "Q: Could downloading Tumblr videos damage/infect Mac? I have downloaded quite some Tumblr videos, both cat videos, funny clips, porn.\nI downloaded them manually, you can save them with right click and save-as with right method - no download program used.\nI have old external hard drive where I keep them, downloaded both in Mac and in Windows. After clean install (due to technical issues not malware), I was going to put my collection back to fresh Mac, but heard these videos could contain malicious code/trojans/malware?\nHaven't done it for a month now - likely never will again just in case - but it would be pity to delete them all so... do I have to for security reasons?\nMy question is - how likely could videos downloaded from Tumblr be malicious?\nAfter all, it is one platform for many different blogs - cat videos, funny clips, porn - they are all uploaded to same server so how likely is they can be infected by\na) uploader\nb) tumblr itself?\n\nA: Short answer yes but probably -- no. \nYou should definitely keep your videos. Don't delete them because you're concerned they could contain malicious data that could trigger errors in the video codec implementations that will lead to code execution on your computer. In fact waiting for some time will lower the likelihood of getting infected since any attack vectors will be invalidated in newer versions of codecs/applications. Keep your video players up to date. Don't use unsupported software which is not receiving updates.\nIf you like to still download and watch those cute movies and have a better conscience I would propose you install VirtualBox and a simple linux distribution for watching and downloading and have backups from your movies. Should that virtual system be infected by whatsoever thingie, just delete that virtual system and install a new one. Infecting a virtual system AND breaching the Hypervisor (the technique that drives virtual box, vmware et al.) is not very likely.\nAnd remember to have BACKUPS! Then you are quite on the safe side. Let there be cat videos.\nAdding to this, it may be also possible to share your media on your local network and watch it with guarded devices / OSs like an iPad running a non jailbroken recent system.\nSome notes about downloads:\nDownloading a file will not infect your system unless it is run or interpreted (like displaying a JPEG oder a Video or running javascript code). So browsing a site may infect your system, since the web-browser will interpret all kind of files not just the desired video. You could use a web scraper like jDownloader or something else to just download stuff from a given URL. My opinion is they do less interpretation. But who knows.\n", "Q: Why kernel log is empty? My macOS 10.12.3 crashed while suspended and I want to look in the log files to determine where the problem comes from.\nI opened System Information and in the Logs I found a Kernel log entry linked to /var/log/asl. But this file is empty. Why?\n\nA: As of 10.12, macOS no longer primarily logs to text files.  However, you can interrogate the stored log data using the log(1) command on the command line in concert with the Console application (found in /Applications/Utilities).\nFor example, to see all log entries generated by the kernel during the last day in old-fashioned syslog-style text, you can do:\nlog show --predicate 'processImagePath contains \"kernel\"' --style syslog --last 1d\n\n(You can also use --start and --end flags if you want to restrict the time window more accurately.)\nAlternatively, you can collect all logs from the past day into a bundle called system_logs.logarchive in the current directory by doing:\nsudo log collect --last 1d\n\nYou can then open this bundle in the Console app (this takes a little while), and in the Search field type process:kernel to find all the log entries generated by the kernel.\nI suggest a thorough reading of the log(1) man page (as well as the other resources it points to), plus some experimentation.\n\nA: Likely because on MacOS, this log is located at /private/var/log/asl\nHere is a tip that I use: given symlinks and hidden folders (plus confusing Unix man), it can be a challenge to find these logs and system reports. Simply open Console, and you will see a list of all the logs and reports.(you will find the one you want under the heading /var/log). Simply right click on the log, and choose 'Reveal in Finder' and it will open directly to the log location!\n", "Q: Uptime report multiple users I'm not sure I understand the command \"uptime\"\nuptime\n13:58  up 5 days,  9:49, 3 users\nI have 3 users detected, but I have only one user account on the Mac and no sharing enabled.\nWhat the users actually are?\n\nA: Close Terminal.app, then open one Terminal.app window and read the manual pages for uptime, w and who, e.g man uptime, then execute each command e.g. uptime, w and whoin that order in that one Terminal.app window you opened.\nIt should become apparent however if not... There are always at least two users logged in, you using console and note its time, it's corresponds to the time you logged into your account from the GUI, and you using ttys000 (the Terminal.app windows that you opened). In these instances you is as shown in the output of who am i.\nEach additional Terminal window you open will show as another user using , e.g. ttys001, ttys002, etc.\n\nA: The 'who' command lists logged-in users. You will probably find that they are multiple copies of yourself; one for each terminal window and one for the \"console\" session.\n\nA: Every terminal window you have opened counts as a login. Open more terminals and type the command again and you will see how the number changes.\n", "Q: How do I change the default alarm sound when creating an alarm with Siri? I picked a song for an alarm and now every  alarm that I create with Siri uses that song. I cannot change the default alarm song back to the default alarm sound. When I need to create an alarm manually I can see the default alarm sound, but every single time I  create an alarm with Siri then it reverts back to that one song. It's impossible to change the default alarm sound that Siri uses. I'm using iOS 10.2. \n\nA: I had the same issue. Did a hard reset (power and volume down until the Apple logo appeared. That'd be power and home button for all other non-7 devices.) It fixed the problem. It was driving me absolutely crazy. \n", "Q: Plist Not Running AppleScript using launchctl I am trying to schedule my AppleScript to run on 60 second intervals that runs two shell scripts and have appeared to setup my plist correctly as two files are outputted (StandardErrorPath and StandardOutPath) after 60 seconds elapse, but I don't see the results of my shell scripts appearing like they did when I ran the script in Script Editor.

For years, I’ve disabled my Mac’s caps lock key (because I only ever hit it by accident) in System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys.\nRecently, I did a clean install of macOS Sierra on my 2014 MacBook Pro. Since then, my disabling of the caps lock key doesn’t seem to persist after reboots.\nI found an apparent report of the same issue on Apple’s forum, and there are a few similar questions about previous versions of macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Caps Lock key mapped to a second Control key, reset after wake in Mountain Lion\n\n*How do I prevent my MacBook Air from forgetting my Remapped Caps Lock Key?\nBut I don’t see an actual identified cause anywhere, nor a workaround.\nIs this a bug? If so, how can I fix it?\nIf not, is there any way I can get the old, persistent behaviour?\n\nA: It could be a problem with file permissions. Try this command in the Terminal (a built-in system tool):\nchmod -RN ~/Library/\n\nIt resets permissions for your user Library folder. When the command is done executing, reboot. Change the setting and then reboot again, and see if the setting persists.\nIf it didn't work, then try this command:\nchmod -RN /Library/\n\nYes, there is a difference: it resets permissions for the system’s Library folder.\nThen reboot and change the setting as mentioned before, and see if it persists now.\n", "Q: Jailbroken iPhone 5S stuck on Recovery screen I have a Jailbroken iPhone5s Or well I had one.

I then plugged it in with iTunes and done Update and Restore but then it was just stuck in that screen. I left it in there for about 6 hours and I can't seem to fix at all. Is there any way to fix this?\n\nA: You need to restore your phone to the latest iOS version being signed, currently iOS 10.2.1.\nYou should never click Reset All Content and Settings on a jailbroken phone, because it will throw you into an irreversible boot loop and you'll be forced to restore.\n", "Q: Music application missing from home screen on iOS I have an iPhone 7. For some reason, the music application is missing from my home screen. I have tried resetting to home screen layout but the music app still doesn't show up.

I heard that sometimes hard drive can get damaged (holding down the power button to force shut down, for example when system is completely frozen - it has happened once or twice for me, no idea why).\nIf hard drive is damaged, would it weaken security in some way? Like OS doesn't function properly and something develops security hole or security patches not working?\nHow would I know if hard drive is damaged?\nSorry for likely dumb question, but I'm trying to figure it out with absolutely no idea about tech. \n\nA: The entire question boils down to this:\n\nHow would I know if hard drive is damaged?\n\nYour computer would start to fail - as in crash, errors would be thrown, it would freeze and perform slowly.\nWhen a drive gets damaged, it doesn't suddenly read incorrect data or modified data; the data is corrupted.  Data that can't be read will with cause (at minimum) an error or crash.\nCan it weaken security?\nYour computer wouldn't be functional by the time it weakened security.  For example, if you are running File Valut, a damaged drive won't decrypt your drive; it won't function. Period.\nIf you somehow crash your firewall config, SIP (system integrity protection) will throw errors that system files have changed.\nSo, how do you know if your hard drive is damaged?\nIf you start getting crashes or freezes or performance problems, one of the things you can do is diagnostic like Apple Hardware Test (AHT).    If you want to just check your disks, there is a nice GUI from Clever Files called DiskDrill (free for the basic utilities, $$ to activate the pro features).  This will help you be proactive.\n\nA: You're basically asking the question \"If my hard drive had different data, what might happen?\" Unfortunately, this is a question that's basically impossible to answer specifically without knowing what data changed.\nImagine that somehow the drive was damaged in a way that modified data on the drive to coincidentally be equivalent to a virus. You'd now have a virus on your machine. On the other hand, that modified data could also just create a text file. It's entirely dependent on how the data changes.\nOf course, both of these scenarios are extremely unlikely. Far more likely, you'll find some piece of your hard drive unreadable and lose some files or something.\nSo how will you know if something happens?\nCheck for SMART errors. SMART is a monitoring system that detects and reports on various indicators of drive reliability. If something goes wrong with the drive, SMART likely will report something wrong, and macOS will notify you. Of course, SMART isn't perfect, but it does help.\nAdditionally, if something appears to be off, you can run Disk Utility's first aid, which will scan for and attempt to correct errors. Sadly, this system isn't perfect, and the HFS+ file system that macOS uses is fairly susceptible to bit rot, which is a form of data loss.\nIn general, the best strategy for preventing data loss is to keep backups. As for security: well, I wouldn't worry about it.\n", "Q: How do you turn off suggestions when adding a new event in calendar? I would like to disable suggestions in the Calendar app on my iphone.  Since my last update, if I add a new event and start typing it flashes through lots of suggestions.  This makes it difficult to add the event you are trying to add, as often I cannot scroll past these to fill out the event, and if you accidentally touch one of the suggestions while you try and scroll you have to delete and start over.\nI have seen this question asked in a few places, but no responses, so I suspect this \"feature\" is something you can't control, but if anyone has found a way to turn this off I'd like to know.\n\nA: Currently you can't disable these suggestions when creating an event.\nThe only calendar suggestions you can disable are the location suggestions and the event suggestions detected from other apps on your device.

Few times I've had to forcibly shut Mac down by holding power button.\nI heard it causes file system damage. \nCould any of such corruption to file system weaken Mac's overall security, damage files OS uses for security purposes?\nFor example Gatekeeper not functioning properly (allowing something to slip through), Mac's own anti-malware checker letting something slip, some Apple's security updates not working - overall something in system weakening so that  malicious party could gain access to Mac through Internet.\nI have asked about hard drive damage here.\nCan damaged hard drive weaken Mac's security?\nThis ask is about file system damage. I hope this isn't breaking rules, but for me they are different categories I started thinking about while learning more.\n\nA: Great Question!\nThere used to be a time when Mac's power button used to be known as certain death if you had to use it.\nA forced shutdown does not damage your hardware, and neither does it weaken your security.\nHowever, it could potentially corrupt your files if you are turning off the computer while they are open or being used (rather common in older models). These files can be anything, from a simple text file, to a bash script, or even to system files (ex. from an update). \nBecause of this, there's no direct link between your system getting corrupted and your security being compromised. If your system has become corrupted to the point that services fail to load or critical files cannot be loaded (happens if you shutdown computers during intensive operations) you will most likely know about it because your computer will fail to boot, or throw errors.\nA corruption in your computer will not suddenly open ports in your firewall, set your password to null, or let programs take over your computer and steal your identity. \n\nA: Short answer is No.\nYou are most likely to suffer other issues such as a corrupted OS or corrupted apps.\nYour macOS depends highly on RAM. RAM flush to hard disk every once a while. it do it faster if there is a installation running or you are saving a file.\nNow if during this flushing to SSD hard disk, if suddenly OS get forced shutdown, file that is is saving at that moment will get corrupted.\nYou can be lucky for few times but eventually you will end up with lot of corrupted files if you keep repeat force shutdown for a while.\n", "Q: how to check if a specific UI element is in focus apple script I've searched a lot for this, but all answers talk about how bringing a whole window (or dialogue.. which is still a window really) into focus via activate etc.\nBut I couldn't find any way of detecting if a specific UI element was selected, in focus etc. \n\nI'm wrote an apple script that automatically jumps to alfred create custom web search, but the script failed when the features tab wasn't selected by default.. so this is what my code looks like:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \",\" using command down\n    delay delay_time\n    tell process \"Alfred Preferences\"\n        delay delay_time\n        -- hack: to ensure that the the \"Default results\" button isn't selected\n        -- by default, we select another tab first, then select the \"features\" tab\n        click button \"Appearance\" of toolbar 1 of window 1\n        click button \"Features\" of toolbar 1 of window 1\n        delay delay_time\n        UI elements of scroll area 1 of window 1\n        -- bring the left menu to focus first (see hack above, without hack this would work sometimes only)\n        keystroke tab\n\nI'd much rather not do this nasty hack (which causes the app to flicker rapidly between tabs whenever i call the shortcut).. i'd rather make a simple if else statement.. ideas?\n\nA: This definitely works on my system running Alfred 3.  You may need to adjust the delay times but as they are now, this script works for me.\nactivate application \"Alfred Preferences\"\ndelay 1.5\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Alfred Preferences\"\n        click button \"Features\" of toolbar 1 of window \"Alfred Preferences\" of application process \"Alfred Preferences\" of application \"System Events\"\n        delay 1\n        set selected of row 3 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window \"Alfred Preferences\" of application process \"Alfred Preferences\" of application \"System Events\" to true\n        delay 1\n        click button \"Add Custom Search\" of tab group 1 of window \"Alfred Preferences\" of application process \"Alfred Preferences\" of application \"System Events\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: My macbook pro os x sierra 10.12.3 keeps crashing and report AirPortBrcm4360 issue My configuration :\n\nMacOS Sierra  10.12.3 (16D32) \nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15', late 2013), \nModel: MacBookPro11,2\n2 GHz Intel Core i7 (i7-4750HQ) CPU: 4-core\n. BANK 0/DIMM0\n.. 4 GB DDR3 1600 MHz ok\n. BANK 1/DIMM0\n.. 4 GB DDR3 1600 MHz ok\nBluetooth: Handoff/Airdrop2\nWireless:  802.11 a/b/g/n/ac\n\nStep to reproduce the crash :\n\n*\n\n*turn wifi on (sometimes crashes happened just after deactivating wifi and when the systems restarted the wifi card had disappeared, icon marked with a cross and popup saying \"no wifi hardware detected\")\n\n*disconnect any ethernet thunderbolt cable or deactivate ethernet connexion\n\n*simply use the computer for instance navigating with safari or chrome or wait a little doing nothing (less than 2 minutes now, but it used to be hours before the problem occurs)\n\n*Boom ! Black screen, fans and keyboards back lights increase activity for a few seconds and then the computer just turns off completely\n\nNoticeable informations :\n\n*\n\n*bluetooth can be on or off, it doesn't matter or affect the crash\nbehavior even if sometimes when I turn on the computer after a crash\nbluetooth can be activated or deactivated when it was in the opposite\nstate before the crash,\n\n*no crashes occur when connected to internet with both wifi and ethernet or just through the ethernet port only. The problem is only when the wifi is on.\n\n*no crashes when in the mac is started in safe mode and with only wifi on\n\n*the issue started after updating to sierra os x and prior that date I had very few crashes in years (almost none). Unfortunately my time machine copies before migrating to sierra have been overwritten with post sierra's copies\n\nI have tried several solutions but the problem remains. Here is a list of the opérations I went through so far with absolutely zero success :\n\n*\n\n*Changing Mac OS X Wireless Card Country Code as explained here\n\n*removing all wifi preferences and all extensions, LaunchAgents, LaunchDeamons, Internet pluggins, etc. (both in /Libbrary/, ~/Library/, /System/Library, etc.)\n\n*removing all my applications that could mess up with the system (brew, ports, cleaner, magicPrefs, Citrix, antivirus, etc.) and cleaned all their remaining files (such as .plist files, etc.)\n\n*updating to os x sierra with the utilities of the recovery mode\n\n*bootable usb key, hard drive format, os x sierra clean installation and personal data recovery with time machine\n\n*and of course I have tried contacting the apple support (feedback/bug report messages, phone calls and several visits to the so called genius bar where all hardware tests showed nothing wrong (their conclusion : as it works fine in safe mode, it might be a software issue but they don't know where and why turning wifi on is triggering the crashes). My conviction : it is a faulty sierra wifi card driver responsible of the crashes as I always get com.apple.driver.AirPort.Brcm4360.0 crash logs after each single unwanted shutdown and few times accompanied with a com.apple.iokit.IO80211Family crash log (CCIOReporter log file).\n\nI think all is said about my issue. And I will also provide a crash report (pretty messy) or an etreCheck reports (clearer) but both didn't give usable information. I hope my approach can help some of you solving similar issues and also that some can help me find a solution.\n\nEtrePort report extract :\n\nLes informations matérielles : ⓘ\n    MacBook Pro (Retina, 15 pouces, fin 2013) \n    [Les caractéristiques techniques] - [Le guide de l’utilisateur] - [Garantie & service]\n    MacBook Pro - modèle : MacBookPro11,2\n    1 2 GHz Intel Core i7 (i7-4750HQ) CPU: 4-core\n    8 GB RAM Pas extensible\n        BANK 0/DIMM0\n            4 GB DDR3 1600 MHz ok\n        BANK 1/DIMM0\n            4 GB DDR3 1600 MHz ok\n    Bluetooth: Bon - Handoff/Airdrop2 disponible\n    Wireless:  en0: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac\n    La batterie : Santé = Satisfaisant - Comptage de cycles = 426\n\nLes informations vidéo : ⓘ\n    Intel Iris Pro\n        Color LCD 2880 x 1800\n\nLes logiciel du système : ⓘ\n    macOS Sierra  10.12.3 (16D32) - Temps depuis le démarrage : environ 2 heures\n\nLes informations des disques : ⓘ\n    APPLE SSD SM0256F disk0 : (251 GB) (Solid State - TRIM: Yes)\n    [Afficher le rapport SMART]\n        EFI (disk0s1)   : 210 Mo \n        Recovery HD (disk0s3)   [Restauration] : 650 Mo \n        Macintosh HD (disk1) /  [Startup] : 249.78 Go (50.76 Go libre)\n            Crypté AES-XTS Ouvert\n            Core Storage: disk0s2 250.14 Go Online\n\nLes informations USB : ⓘ\n    Apple Inc.

I am on iOS 10.2 (Jailbroken, iPad Air 2) and I recently installed a bad tweak, it put me into a boot loop in which I got out of, but when I enter safe mode I can't go into cydia and un-install it because cydia keeps crashing, I try to enter yalu102 app and re-jailbreak but when it \"successfully jailbreaks\" it goes back into a boot loop because of the bad tweak I installed.\n\nA: Are you sure it's a boot loop and not a respring loop? You say you \"got out of it\" suggests it's the latter. Cydia crashing means you're not in Safe Mode but rather in an unjailbroken state. Whilst tapping go in yalu102, hold volume up until the device resprings to try entering No Substrate Mode.

I am using iTunes 12.5 on Windows 10 with an iPhone 5s.\nSometimes I download hour-long .mp3 files that I want to put onto my iPhone as podcasts, so that it automatically remembers where I am in my listening if I have to stop in the middle.  I know how to transfer .mp3 files to my iPhone, where they show up as Music.  I also know that I can right click on any song, choose 'Get Info' and under Options change the media kind to 'Podcast.'  But when I change the file to a podcast, it disappears from iTunes, though it does show up on my device when I open the Podcasts app.\nHow can I transfer an .mp3 file to my iPhone as a podcast, and still have that podcast show up in iTunes when I look there to see what podcasts are on my device?\n\nA: First connect your device to your computer and open iTunes.  Go to the iTunes Library.  If you don't see the Library option in iTunes, you can get there by clicking on the 'Done' button in the lower right corner (if it's there).\nIn Library, click on the File menu, then select Add File to Library...  Browse to the .mp3 file you want to import as a podcast, and choose it.  This file will now show up in iTunes Library under Music.  Right-click on the \"song\" and choose Get Info or Album Info.  Make sure the file has a \"song\" title and an album name.  (Optional: change the genre to 'Podcast'. Also optional, add artwork if you want.)  Under the Options tab, change the media kind from Music to Podcast.  Now click OK at the bottom.\nThe \"song\" will now have disappeared from Music.  Change the Library over to Podcasts, and you should now see the file there.\n\nThe final step is to right click on the (now podcast) file and choose Add to Device (your device is connected, right?) and select your device.  Voilà!  The .mp3 file is now a podcast that shows up both in iTunes for your device, and also in the Podcasts app on your device.\n", "Q: Mac wouldn't start up after I tried to fix a Mac App Store issue I have a MacBook Pro (13 Inch, End 2010) running OS X El Capitan.\nI had a bug with the Mac App Store, searched on the Apple forum, and got advice to remove a folder var/folders/zz.

Recently, he bought a $10 battery (0 cycles, manufactured 4 months ago) on eBay and replaced it, while my iPhone has the factory battery.\nHow do I test both iPhones to see if it's worth to change my battery too?\nNote: cellular data is not available, only WiFi.\n\nA: Monomeeth provides a good guide on how to do the process of testing your battery manually, but there are two ways to do this automatically (and with fewer variables that could affect results).\nMethod 1: App\nBattery Life (free ad-supported app) lets you check the health of your iPhone's battery immediately after downloading. In my experience, it's very accurate, and reviews seem to agree. Opening it up, you'll see a battery wear percentage on each of the iPhones, and approximate runtimes for talk/browsing/video usage.\nThe app is a simple way to objectively see if it's time to replace your iPhone battery.\n\nDisclaimer: I have personally used the app but I am not affiliated with its developer in any way.\n\nMethod 2: Genius Bar\nIf you bring your iPhones into the genius bar, a genius can help you run diagnostics on the iPhones to see each battery's wear and current capacity (at no charge).\nThis is definitely the more official way to do it, but it does require taking a trip to an Apple Store. Read more about Apple's battery diagnostic here.\n\ntl;dr: Download this app or go the genius bar for a battery diagnostic (which is a real thing).\n\nNote: In my personal opinion, whether it's time to replace your battery is more subjective than objective. If the battery life is significantly worse than you remember it being, it's probably time to get a new battery!\n\nA: By implication, I'm assuming you don't want to just use an app, but instead want to do some real life testing.\nHowever, the only way to do this and ensure some degree of accuracy is to ensure:\n\n\n*\n\n*that you have the exact same apps running during these tests \n\n*all apps (and iOS itself) must be the same version\n\n*the start and end times (and therefore also duration) are identical 1\n\n*the ambient temperature at the time was identical (in other words, you'd have to do this in the same air-conditioned environment set at the same temperature)\n\n\nIn a nutshell what you would do is something like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully charge both iPhones and disconnect them from AC power at 10pm\n\n*At 8am play the same movie at full volume and full brightness on both iPhones\n\n*At conclusion of the movie, take note of the battery percentage\n\n*Play the movie again (still at full volume and brightness)\n\n*At conclusion of the movie, take note of the battery percentage again\n\n*Play the movie again (still at full volume and brightness)\n\n*At conclusion of the movie, take note of the battery percentage again\n\n*Play the movie yet again (still at full volume and brightness)\n\n*At conclusion of the movie, take note of the battery percentage again (assuming you've still got a charge)\n\n\nNow fully charge both iPhones and leave them connected to AC power until 8am the next day, at which point you disconnect from power and perform the same test (i.e. same room, same movie, same volume, same brightness, etc).\nNOTE: The above test scenario is only an example case of how you could test both iPhones. The idea of the scenario I outline above is just to get across how one would conduct a test of both iPhones to ensure some validity to the results. Or, to put it another way, to ensure you're comparing Apples with Apples (yes, pun intended). Also, one of the other factors you need to consider is your actual phone usage during the test - to ensure a valid comparison you'd really have to have the phone switched off.\nRegardless of the test scenario you adopt, compare the differences in your battery percentages (and also whether one phone runs longer under the same conditions) to determine whether the $10 battery is worth the trouble. \n1 Actually, while the start times should be identical, the end time may not need to be (and therefore neither the duration). This way you can take note of whether one phone can endure your test scenario for longer than the other and, if so, how much longer? For example, in my scenario, can one phone play the movie a full 4 times? Can both do that? Keep going to see if one can continue to play the movie for longer and, if so, how much longer?\nIn a nutshell, only you can decide, based on your test results, whether it's worth changing your battery too.\n", "Q: \"Unable to verify account name or password\" in Mail app despite using correct info I had a problem with my Mac mail account and therefore I deleted some 4 keychain entries from my Keychain Access that were related to mail.

The device only has USB-C ports, so I bought two types of converters (not official from Apple, but didn't think that would matter): \n\n\n*\n\n*This adapter, that I use with a regular hdmi cable. \n\n*This adapter with integrated cable. \n\n\nNone are recognised by the Mac. I've tried hitting the option key and detecting displays, but none show. I've also tried plugging in the usb cable that is attached to the last cable in the tv too, no luck. I see that the first adapter has a power slot too, I can try to plug in a usb power source there? \nI've also just updated Sierra, no luck. \nAny other suggestions? My vga / usb-c adapter works fine. \nIs there any logfile or so that I could check to see if the device gets recognised?\n\nA: Based on everything you have described, it sounds like the problem is between your MBP and the TV(s).  I am not a fan of no-name adapters like the one you linked in your question. \nI have personally recommended this Anker USB-C to HDMI adapter to a family member with excellent results.\n\nIt's got high ratings, an 18 month warranty and supports 4K at 60Hz.  The adapters you referenced didn't support that level of resolution (1080p looked to be the max).\n\nA: You probably don't need to replace adapter. It should work unless it is defective.\nI read the instructions here...\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201177\nJust plug in your display to your MacBook Pro using your adapter and restart your Mac.

I have a 2015 Retina MacBook Pro, 15-inch. \nWhenever the CPU usage goes above ~30%, the reported temperature spikes and the fans kick in.  As if the temperature sensor was oversensitive. I've tried resetting SMC but no change. Is there something else I can try? \n(An authorized service provider just sent it back to me after replacing one of the fans but that didn't fix the issue.)\n\nA: I see two potential problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*An \"over sensitive\" sensor as you described that is reporting the CPU temp as higher than what it's supposed to be\n\n\nor....\n\n\n*A faulty CPU that has a temperature spike when you put it under load.  In this case, the sensor is working correctly.\n\n\nThe tech changing out the fan can do nothing to fix this problem - remember, the sensor is \"reading\" a temp change and telling the SMC to kick on the fans.  Changing the fan won't change how the sensor works.\nWhat you need to do is diagnose whether or not the temp reading is accurate and whether the sensor is working or not.  You can start with Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  (Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected) and then take it into Apple to have it diagnosed.\n", "Q: Unable to download or stream purchased song from iCloud Library I noticed an issue a few months ago that songs that had been uploaded to my iCloud Library (a feature of Apple Music) were occasionally not playing on my iPhone. Trying to download or stream the song would result in my phone waiting a few seconds and then start playing the next queued song. The phone never threw an error and it always happened on the same songs.\nAll of my music is available locally on my computer, so I never saw the problem there. But out of curiosity I removed the download of one of the problematic songs, tried streaming and it failed on my computer. iTunes throws an error: \"There was a problem downloading [song artist/ title] An unknown error occurred (-206). Please check the connection to the network is active and try again\"\nAfter doing some digging I discovered that songs that had either been purchased from iTunes OR downloaded from iTunes Match and then uploaded to iCloud Library (instead of being matched by iCloud Library), will always fail to download from iCloud Library. In iTunes it can be filtered like this:\nKind: “Purchased AAC audio file” OR “Matched AAC audio file” iCloud Status: “Uploaded”\nI was wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue? And if so, do you know how to force the song to upload?\nAnd if anyone is willing, and I’d be very interested in knowing if you filter for those types of songs and remove the downloaded version, are you able to re-download or stream them? PLEASE BACKUP YOUR MUSIC BEFORE TRYING THIS — in my case, if I had not had a local backup of my library I would have lost these songs.\nSome example images of the errors:\n\n\n\nA: Found a kind of workaround to re-upload those related songs. Make sure you have a backup of those songs before trying in case something will go wrong, and make sure you have exported your custom created playlists to import them later if any of those songs are there.\nYou are going to remove those Matched or Purchased kind of files and will create new ones. These steps should save all the metadata like ratings, play counts and so on, but will have a new one date added to library.\niCloud should have to check those files again and will make those songs Matched or Uploaded once again, but this time everything should be playable and downloadable for offline use.\nMake sure you have the iTunes Plus setting in Preferences > Import Settings.\nCreate the new playlist and put all songs you found broken in your previously created Smart Playlist, just in case it will not mess up later. Create a new Smart Playlist with todays Date Added, this will put all fixed files there that you will create later.\nIn the next step you have to Create AAC version in File > Convert. This will make a duplicate file but all the crucial metadata should be the same, file size may be larger or smaller though.\nNow you need to completely remove broken songs under Song > Delete From Library.\nThis will give new Removed iCloud status to the newly created files. You will need to select all files in the new Smart Playlist with Date added today setting, right-click and select Add to iCloud Music Library.\nYou will have now Matched or Uploaded iCloud status in these files but everything should work properly now. The location of files eventually should be the same as removed ones, so you can have playable Exported playlists that you want to Import now.\n", "Q: Deleted files from Macintosh HD still take up space I just deleted about 50GB of files from my Mac's onboard storage, however it only resulted in the removal of about 8GB.\nWhat happened and how can I fix this?\n\nA: It's called local snapshots which works as a backup, if you are low in space the OS will automatically delete the stuff.\n", "Q: Downgrade macOS Sierra of a brand new MacBook Here is my story.\nFew weeks ago I've bought a brand new MacBook Pro 13' (2015 edition). I've opened it and installed macOS Sierra for the first time. This laptop has never been on some other OS. However, I experience some UI lags which are just killing me and my experience. I've never expected this from a new MacBook Pro. For example when I scroll through Facebook or trying to resize some application (even if I try to resize the activity monitor) there is a noticeable lag and 'decrease of the FPS'. Not really expected this kind of issues.\nJust for my peace of mind, I've run a few benchmarks (CPU, GPU, SSD), downloaded a few 'normal-weight' games and everything looks OK. Games have I would say normal FPS and when I compare the benchmarks results they are pretty good and almost the same compared to other 2015 MacBook Pro's.\nI was told that this UI lag is because of the OS and if I downgrade and wait until the next macOS release, this will be probably fixed. So, OK I want to downgrade, but I can't figure out how. \n\nA: Macbook Pro 2015 came with El Captain version pre-installed in factory therefor you can easily revert back to Factory installed OS by using Internet Recovery.\nDon't forget to Backup everything. (since it is a new Macbook pro, maybe you don't have much in it yet to backup? otherwise backup everything. Use TimeMachine to backup)\nNow, turn off your Macbook. Turn it on and hold Command+Option+R\nYou will see a rotating earth icon. Connect to your WiFi and let it download and install El Captain from Apple servers.\n", "Q: Does a voice text get deleted? I sent a voice text to a friend, but didn't save it on my thread. And it was automatically deleted after the default 2 minutes. \nDoes the voice text stay on the recipients messaging thread until they have a chance to hear it, and then decide weather or not to keep it? \nBasically, do remote deletes on their thread happen once it's been deleted on my thread?\n\nA: There is a setting under Settings -> Messages -> Audio Messages section. There is an \"Expire\" option, where you can select 'after 2 minutes' or 'never'. That is why it disappeared from your message thread.\nYour friend will have it in their message thread until they listen to it, and then the phone will either remove it after 2 minutes or keep it, depending on what their setting is.\nSo to be clear: what you see in your message thread isn't in any way linked to what your friend sees in theirs. If your message gets delivered to two Macs, three iPads and one iPhone, this concept applies to pictures as well. Each device that has the message handles deletions independently of the others. \n", "Q: Why the weird lag in Screen Sharing app when using the LG Ultrafine 5K monitor? Hardware:\nLate 2016 MacBook Pro w/ TouchBar\nLG Ultrafine 5K display\nSetup:\nScreen Sharing app connected to remote instance in the cloud\nProblem:\nVery slow response to keystrokes.  There is no problem in other applications.   The problem goes away if I disconnect the external display.  The problem does not go away if I switch from WiFi to a hardwired Ethernet connection.  I had thought this might be the monitor's shielding problem interfering with WiFi but no, it happens without WiFi.  Truly perplexing!\n\nA: Apple's implementation of VNC ScreenSharing often falls short, with significant lag regardless of whether Adaptive Quality is selected or not. A more robust 3rd-party solution like (the free) VNCViewer will provide you with fine-grained compression control, allowing workable VNC sessions over the tightest of bandwidth (e.g. through a shell tunnel to a remote server with really low upload speeds).  \n", "Q: Random letters and touch input on iPad A couple of days ago, my iPad started inserting random letters into what I was typing. For instance, I would try to type a C and a V would be typed. This would be the same for many letters. When I pressed Backspace to delete it would either delete multiple letters or insert various random letters. I reset the iPad and it worked better for a couple of days, but now symptoms have arisen again.  This has been happening when using Facebook, Messenger and Mail so it's not restricted to one app. What can I do?\n\nA: I've seen a couple variations of this problem before, and its usually one of 3 problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*your touch screen is starting to malfunction. This is uncommon, but things happen with electronics. Seek repair from Apple.\n\n*Poorly conditioned electricity. Does this only happen when your iPad is plugged in? I had a generic plug that induced symptoms like you describe. Unplug the ipad and see if it still happens.\n\n*Liquid damage. This is probably the most frequent cause of electrical anomalies like this. Did anyone spill anything on the ipad, even if not recently?\n\n\nA: If your iPad is in a case or holder, remove it.\nSwitch off, and on again.\n", "Q: Imessaging when travelling and not using cellular I would like to know whether iMessages will revert to text messages when I travel overseas and have my cellular set to \"off when roaming\". I normally use SMS or MMS to keep in touch when travelling. \n\nA: Providing you have Settings > Messages > Send as SMS toggled on and Settings > Mobile Data > Mobile Data Options > Data Roaming toggled off then yes, messages sent from the Messages app will go as SMS.\n", "Q: Will changing my MAC address void my warranty or affect any existing programs? Noobie here \nPretty much what the title says.\nI have 2016 Macbook Pro (macOS 10.12.3), so, will changing the MAC Address by terminal or by using some program like SpoofMAC void my warranty or AppleCare Protection?\nWill it hinder my iMessage or Facetime or any other existing programs?\nThanks!\n\nA: It shouldn't. I'm currently doing it on hotel wifi and everything seems to work fine. Restoring your default MAC address is as simple as rebooting the machine, so no way for Apple to really know anyway!\n", "Q: can't swift auth in Sierra swift auth yields the error:\n\nerror: unable to invoke subcommand: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swift-auth (No such file or directory)\n\nwhen I brew install it it does the same thing.  how can I swift auth again?\n\nA: Xcode is an easy reinstall.

When I double-click one of these items to open a window on it, the window opens with the tab “Attributes” selected; when I try to click the tab header “Access Control”, the header animates but the tab itself does not open. The tab “Attributes” remains selected.\nI am not sure whether it’s related, but in Console I see repeated entries for Keychain Access that say: CSSM Exception: -2147413737 CSSMERR_DL_DATASTORE_DOESNOT_EXIST. There are also a lot of entries that say: CSSM Exception: -2147413750 CSSMERR_DL_INVALID_FIELD_NAME.\nHow can I fix the items so I can open the tab “Access Control” again? I am not sure whether the keychain itself is broken, is there some Terminal command I can use to verify (and repair) it? Or does “Access Control” rely on some other data store that may need repair?\n\nA: Try setting category to \"My Certificates\" at the left bottom of \"KeyChain Access\" window. Then find the certificate, expend it to get the key and try changing \"Access Control\" on that one.\n", "Q: Why is my hostname set to a random number (228) in the bash prompt on OS X? Today I saw that when I open a terminal, the bash prompt displays username@228~:. When I type in pwd I get /Users/username so I was wondering where does this 228 come from? It wasn't like that couple of days ago and I am not sure what introduced this change.\nMy OS is OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.\nIn .bash_profile I have export PS1=\"\\u@\\h\\w: \".\n\nA: From the list of prompt strings (see PROMPTING in man bash):\n\\h     the hostname up to the first `.'\n\nUsually, this gives a nice short hostname but in your case leads to the slightly confusing 228.\n\nA: You are connected to the wrong Internet provider.\nYep, in your WiFi router, you have (at least) TWO WiFi networks.\nYou are connected to the one which is accessible to everybody.\nProbably, your ISP allows you to connect country-wide with the same credentials you use at your home.\nThis is the explanation, but the solution ... doesn't exist.\n", "Q: How to share and sync only selected Contact groups between iphones OK here goes. I apologise in in advance if questions is really stupid.\nMy husband and I run a charity. The charity doesn't have much money so we use our personal iPhone (with shared apple-id) to do personal stuff as well as charity work. The charity bought another iPhone for another charity worker to use. The three of us need to be able to share all the Charity contacts which I have in special contact groups. At the moment this other worker shares our apple-id. It makes me nervous though 'cause she can see all our personal photos and contacts not related to the Charity. How do I get around this? And how could it work for other charity workers? Also we need to send out a lot of large group texts (as our charity recipients don't use email). Is there an App you'd recommend? The GroupText one I use doesn't have much flexibility.\n\nA: Don't keep the contacts you want to share in iCloud.  Use, for instance, a GMail user, and keep the contents there.  All three of you sync the GMail contacts list.\n\nA: Honestly, this is a situation you should never have got yourself into in the first place.\nNot only are you sharing contact details with this, hopefully trustworthy, third party, you are also sharing all your online passwords & other security details that iCloud remembers for you, including any bank cards you have saved into the system & additionally they have access to any apps you have purchased & any data those apps may store as part of your ID.\nIt is not even recommended to use the same Apple ID in the same family.\nInstead you should use Family Sharing for yourself & your husband, which enables the sharing of some data, but not all & as already stated by Marc, use some 3rd party contacts system, Gmail etc to share just the required set of contacts.\n", "Q: Can't boot Windows 10 past loading animation under Bootcamp I have a 2016 MBP with Sierra and have installed Windows 10 under Bootcamp. This has been running fine for a month or so but today I installed Docker in Windows and when it required a restart it restarted twice (both times requiring me to hold ALT to select Windows drive) and now does not get past the Windows 10 logo and cycling dots animation.\nDo I need to reinstall Windows or will a USB bootable drive help? I have not created one yet.\nTL;DR: I cannot get Windows 10 to boot past the loading animation after installing Docker in Windows.\n\nA: Don't reinstall Windows just yet. Your boot files are fine, It wouldn't pass the first screen otherwise. The fact that you see the windows logo suggests the something (probably Docker, might be something else too) messed up your drivers.\nGet into Windows safe mode and see if you can Uninstall Docker, if that doesn't work, check if you have a restore point to before the install. \n", "Q: How to get into Windows 10 Safe Mode on 2016 MacBook Pro? I'm told I need to get into Windows 10's Safe Mode running under Boot Camp, but I'm on a Mac Book Pro, 2016 model, which does not have function keys at start up.\nHow can I force Safe Mode for Windows 10 on the most recent MBP?\nPrevious Question: Can't boot Windows 10 past loading animation under Bootcamp\n\nA: Basically hold the shift key while booting up or restarting.\nThis assumes that Windows is your default startup disk.\nMicrosoft changed how to get into Safe Mode on Windows 10. From Microsoft.com:\n\nRestart your PC. When you get to the sign-in screen, hold the Shift\nkey down while you select Power Power icon\n\nRestart. After your PC restarts to the Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart.\nAfter your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 4 or F4\nto start your PC in Safe Mode. Or if you'll need to use the Internet,\nselect 5 or F5 for Safe Mode with Networking.\n\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem where I needed to boot into safe mode or access other Windows recovery options, but couldn't because my Mac had the touch bar and for some reason my trackpad and keyboard would not work when booting into Windows, at all. After learning that Windows should automatically boot into recovery mode if there have been 4-5 hard reboots (assuming Bootcamp is your main startup disk), I tried hard resetting (holding the power button down until it shuts down, then pushing the power button to turn it on) several times. \nOn top of that, considering my trackpad and keyboard would not work when booting into Windows, I instead hard rebooted while holding down the Option button, which brought up the Mac and Bootcamp (Windows) partitions, where my trackpad and keyboard worked. Then, I held down the shift button while I clicked on the Bootcamp (Windows) partition \"arrow\" button. That booted Windows into recovery mode, which gave me the options I needed and I was able to fix what I needed to.\nThis may have been a combination of just being lucky (a fluke) with the amount of times I tried hard rebooting and thinking of holding down Shift while clicking on the Windows partition. \n\nA: Make a bootable USB key using the Windows Media Installation Tool (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and boot from it on your Mac. \nI just finished going through this, and fixed it. It was a pain because you can't run the tool on a Mac, so you must run the tool on a spare PC. I was on vacation, and didn't have one until I got home. My Windows 10 boot up was stuck at the blue logo.\nOnce you re-start the Mac with the USB drive created by the tool, hold down the Option Key, and you'll see the USB option EFI Boot.  \nWhen that starts, select 'Repair your computer,' NOT 'Install Windows' > Troubleshoot > Startup Repair \nThat worked for me... Don't forget to keep that USB drive around :) \n", "Q: How to access continuity through applescript or command line Goal:\nI want to handoff my localhost site to my phone for testing. I can access my localhost by going to http://my.ip.add.ress/localhost on my iphone. Of course, on my computer the actual address is just http://localhost. Instead of typing that address I want to trigger a script that will \"handoff\" the concatenation of my computer's ip address + localhost/page. \nMy question is if I can trigger a \"handoff\" through applescript or command-line. Is there a handoff API?\nI'm not asking about how to get my computer's ip address.\n\nA: You can probably avoid all the hassle by just using one nice service - http://xip.io\nInstead of browsing to http://localhost - look up your IP and browse to http://192.168.12.13.xip.io/\nOf course, your actual IP address for the local host is needed unless your router was set up to assign your test Mac 192.168.12.13 - even though you aren't asking how to get your IP, that's the key to making this easy for safari to hand off the session from macOS to iOS.\n\n\nDoes xip.io cost anything?\nNope! xip.io is a free service from Basecamp, the\n  creators of Pow. We were tired of jumping through hoops\n  to test our apps on other devices and decided to solve\n  the problem once and for all.\n\n", "Q: Why is iTunes account showing up in system services but I don't have an account I don't have a iTunes account. \nWhy is iTunes account showing up using cellular data in the system services view of used data?\n\nA: Go to iTunes and App Store in settings app and turn off \"use cellular data\". \nThe App Store use is bundled with iTunes use in that category. \n", "Q: Blocking the internal microphone hole Anyone know why blocking the Macbook Air's internal microphone hole (using a tape or finger) seems to almost completely disable recording? Surely, sound should penetrate through the metal case. Could it be that when the hole is taped, OSX thinks all sounds are ambient noises?\nEDIT: Covering the microphone hole on my LG G3 phone hardly does anything though.\n\nA: So the answer to this question involves 8th grade science. So brace yourself. The answer has to do with the change of medium for the sound waves to travel through. Solids can conduct sound much better than air in truth but the transition between the two states of matter requires a decent amount of energy to switch so by covering it you are trying to make it change not once but twice as it hits the outside and changes to move through the solid then hits the air and thus you expend much of the energy. This reduces the volume and can even negate it all together. (Ever heard of sound proofing? This is the concept of it they just find a substance that absorbs the energy rather than allowing it to pass) So now knowing this you may just want to remove the case or get an external mic. like the rest of us. Sorry for the lengthy answer.\n\nA: Covering the microphone will indeed reduce your ability to make a recording (check in System Preferences -> Sound -> Input; there is an option for using the \"internal microphone\" as an input, but none for \"metal case\").\nMight I suggest simply uncovering it for the purposes of making your recording and then covering it back up afterwards?\n", "Q: Lost free space after failed Disk Utility operation? I have a 3.1 TB Fusion Drive on an iMac running Sierra, and I wanted to create a new partition (of 1.5 TB). I booted into Recovery Mode and used Disk Utility to create a new volume.

This is quite easy to achieve in Thunderbird but I can't see anything for this for Outlook?\n\nA: As of Outlook 16.23 (February 2019), such a feature to limit the email downloaded by date does not appear to exist. There's a feature request on Outlook's UserVoice forum for this functionality.\nFor an IMAP account, under the account's Advanced settings, you can configure Outlook to only download headers.\n\n\nThere is nothing similar for Exchange accounts.\n\nA: If you set up your Gmail account as a regular IMAP account (and not as a gmail account) in Outlook, you can limit the download size.  For this, you would also need to change your IMAP settings in Gmail.  There is an option to restrict the number of messages that can be synced. I have set it to 1000.  This does not work by number of days, but close enough if you can guess a number for yourself.\n", "Q: How do I fix Double NAT caused by sharing wifi internet on my local wifi network? My apartment building provides free wifi internet.  I have a local wifi network with multiple IOT devices, so I need to be able to serve the building's wifi across my local wifi just as I would if I was accessing the internet by cable modem.  I own two wifi routers: A current gen Apple Express and an old Airport Extreme.\nI set up the Airport Express to connect to my building's wifi.  I connected it by ethernet to my Airport Extreme, which sees it as if it were a modem.\nIt works, but, I get a Double NAT error.\nA: How do I fix the Double NAT, and B: How do I make sure my local network is secure?\n\nA: you need to put the base station into \"Bridge Mode\" so that it does not think it is on a separate network and merely participates in your building's WiFI.\nOpen up the Airport utility, select the Airport in question, Click the Network tab, then choose \"Off (Bridge mode)\" from the Router menu.\nWhen you apply those changes the Airport will need to restart and you should be good to go.\n\nA: There's nothing really wrong with double-NAT, I have it here because of a combined phone and internet router. The WAN connection goes to a 192.168.0 LAN with my Airport as the sole client. Airport provides a 192.168.1 network to everything else.\nThe phone company's router is set up to provide a static address to the Airport and forward all ports (DMZ) to it.\nYou can turn off the warning (and yellow light) in Airport Utility.\nI run OSX Server on my desktop, I have websites, file sharing, VPN, calendar, contacts, and remote-control cameras all running behind the double-NAT, accessible from the internet, and I have no problems whatsoever.\n\nA: This worked for me (OSX 10.11):\nSystem Preferences > Network > (in left column, select the \"service\" through which you get your internet access) > Advanced > Configure IPv6 > Link-local only\n", "Q: Completely clear all cloud music from iPhone I'm trying to get rid of all of the cloud music from my iPhone 6S on iOS 10.2.1.\nSo far I have:\nGone to Settings>iTunes & App Store> and toggled Automatic Downloads> Music\nGone to Settings>Music and: \n\n\n*\n\n*turned off (and on and off again) \"Show Apple Music\"\n\n*turned off Mobile data.\n\n*gone to \"Downloaded Music\" and selected to delete all songs - now shows \"Zero KB\"\n\n*Signed out of home sharing\n\n\nI have signed out from my apple ID. I have signed out under Settings>iCloud.\nI have deleted all playlists.\nAfter all of this I have rebooted the phone.\nI have tried everything I can think of and when I go to Music> Library or Songs I still see a few hundred songs with the cloud download icon next to them.\nIs the only way to delete them individually? This whole system is a joke. I have looked at the similar questions here and have not found an answer that works.\n\nA: The most recent version of iOS I have used is 7.1.2, but in that version you have to go to Settings>iCloud>Account Name>Delete All Data, and then sign out. It still may not fully work, so you should also log in to your Apple account in your browser (or go to Settings>iCloud if you have a Mac), open the list of devices associated with your account, and remove the iPhone. Finally you may want to change your account password to make sure the device cant be auto added to the account when it reconnects to the internet.\nI will be the first to agree that their forced integration of iCloud and refusal to let you remove it is crap. For this reason I might also recommend jailbreaking if you're okay with it. Once an iDevice is jailbroken you can install iFile and manually delete the songs from the iCloud music folder. Be careful though because deleting the folder itself could cause problems.\n", "Q: Can I charge my MacBook with a phone charger? Can I use a phone USB-C charger (e.g. the from google) to charge my 2016 MacBook Pro? How about a USB-A charger with a USB A->C cable?\nPhysically it fits, but this answer says that it is not a good idea, without elaborating why.\n\nA: The reason you can't do this is a matter of input. \nThe 13\" MBP has a 61W charger - a lot more than your typical phone charger brick. Check your phone brick and see how much of a difference there is. \nYour Macbook would probably not even accept the charge because it would be so low\n", "Q: Can I safely delete a “.keychain” file from Keychains when there is a corresponding “.keychain-db” file? In the folder “Keychains” in my Library folder (~/Library/Keychains), I have a file “login.keychain” and a file “login.keychain-db”. Is the file “login.keychain” still being used in macOS Sierra, or is it safe to delete it?\nI have a few other keychains with pairs of these files “name.keychain” and “name.keychain-db”. But when I create a new keychain in Keychain Access, there’s only a file “name.keychain-db”. Based on this and the modification times of the files, I’m guessing Sierra only uses the new files (“name.keychain-db”), but that the upgrade left the old files (“name.keychain”) in place as a backup? So it should be safe to remove the old files?\n\nA: Yes, the .keychain files are the old format.\n.keychain-db is the new format.\nModify a key in Keychain access and observe the modification dates. I deleted those files years ago without issue.\n\nA: Using OS 10.12.6 Sierra on a MacBook Pro 2016 \nI would not delete either database without confirming that the contents are identical, then keeping a copy elsewhere, as mentioned above, if you experiment. \nI found 2 databases in my system library that appear to represent my full database:  login.keychain and login.keychain-db.  These names do not match the Keychain List item names in the top L corner area within Keychain Access (hover over the keychain name to see the System library database to which that Keychain correspond), which makes things more confusing.  \nThe 2 Keychains are not identical (check the number of items at the bottom of the KA screen).  It appears that the smaller of the 2 databases contains earlier versions of items that may or may not have been updated.  In any case, if you select a database from the Keychains list, you can sort it by Date Modified in the KA window. Compare this with the other Keychains in your list sorted by Date Modified.  In my case, the date modified range of one keychain is cut off at a certain date, while the date modified range in the other keychain continues to the date of my last entry.  \nThis makes me want to assume that I could delete the database that has the earlier Date Modified cutoff date.  If I search for an item that has been created before and modified after that cutoff date, it shows up in search results as a separate item.  \nSomehow, at sometime the OS separated my Keychain Access database into 2 visible databases that are really part of the same database at a lower level(see Apple Support info below). The active database appears to be the one with -db in the System Library name.  \nThe Date Modified cutoff date on the older database is on or near the date of my upgrade to Sierra (on my new computer) from my old OS 10.6.8 on my old computer. However, I don't recall noticing data in 2 databases or receiving duplicated search results prior to re-installing my Sierra system and the last update patch.\nThe frustration is that when I search or browse, I might inadvertently access older information (or none at all or end up recreating an item).  Until this is better explained, I would a) Hang on to a copy of all databases outside the System Library and b)be very careful about comparing information in the 2 databases if both are left in the System.  I might (but have not yet) experiment with preserving a copy of the older database outside the System Library, removing it from the active System and see what I am left with.\nAssuming the above, merging keychains would not be a good idea, since older versions of items might either replace or live alongside the newer versions.  \nFYI for those dealing with the above issue or wanting to merge/export keychains or keychain items for other reasons (in my case, I also had items missing entirely):\nI called Apple Support and spoke with a Sr Advisor.  The above scenario was a mystery to him.  He also had the mistaken idea that Keychain Access allows export and import of items using the File Menu commands. (This is not true--Export remains greyed out no matter what or how much is selected.  He will report this to Apple Engineers along with the evidence of 2 separate databases in KA).  \nHe also thought that I could simply select an item and drag it to another keychain (in my scenario above, this does not work because KA thinks the item already exists and won't transfer it--the databases are linked at a lower level).  \nWe also tried copying an item to the clipboard and pasting.  This resulted in copying only the contents of the item with no way to import except by creating new empty containers in KA.\nSo, as of this moment, there is no way to merge keychain items, only recreate them.  There are a few online posts that indicate that AppleScript commands might accomplish this, but it is more complex a process that I am ready to risk my OS on.\nIf anyone has a legitimate, confirmed by Apple, resolution to any of this or further legit explanation, please post it. \nUntil then, please call Apple with your issue so there is a substantial record in their database.\nUPDATE: I tried removing the database with the earlier Date Modified cutoff and all seems OK.....but be careful.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of this Danish iWeb homepage? Whenever I reboot my Mac (formerly 2009 13\" MBP, recently migrated to a 2015 13\" MBP) my Google Chrome homepage shows the following Danish iWeb help page. I no longer have iWeb installed, but I imagine it's followed me onto my new MBP via the Migration Assistant.\nI've verified that my home page is setup correctly in chrome and if I close the Chrome window and re-open it my home page will be correct, so this problem only occurs once per boot.\nHere's the window that I'm talking about: \nI've never had my Mac set to Danish, but this Mac has gone through several family members and several OSX updates through the years.\n\nA: As both @IconDaemon and another user suggested, I noticed the MBP was just opening Chrome without the user asking it, it was on boot. This led to the \"Login Items\" prefpane under User Accounts which looked like this:\n\nHow did she get that 24538.html there... Once it was removed (via the minus sign), problem solved. I had no idea you could set a web page to open on login...\nWe cleaned up a bunch of these items after testing the removal of just the html file. Removing just the html file worked.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall an app from my Mac? I know I'm a bit silly here, and I've just recently switched from Windows to Mac. All I would do on a PC is press Win+X and then the F key to get to \"Programs and Features\" window, and search for the app from the list and then uninstall them. So I was wondering if there is anything similar on Mac as well. \n\nA: For most apps, it's easy as navigating to your Applications folder in the Finder, then dragging the application to the Trash icon in your Dock. You can also right-click and select 'Move to Trash', or hit ⌘-delete.\nI should also add, many apps store your settings and data in a different directory which doesn't get deleted simply by deleting the app in the Applications folder. This is both good and bad. If you ever reinstall the app, all your settings and data will still be in place. Keeping these extra files around doesn't really do macOS any harm. Although if you're concerned about removing EVERYTHING for a particular app, it can be tough to make sure you get everything. There are various utilities that make this a bit easier, one I've used in the past is AppZapper.\nIf you're curious, these files are usually in ~/Library/Application Support and ~/Library/Preferences.\n\nA: sudo rm -rf /Applications/youapp.app\n\n", "Q: Macbook pro wont boot, Kernel cache read error 0x6 I have recently installed macOS Sierra and sometimes my Macbook pro mid-2012 boots up properly (rarely).

Right now I'm asking this question using my Mac because it was of of those good times when it did boot properly.\n\nA: There's probably some sort of corruption in the kernel or Kernel cache. \nBest bet would be to backup your data first, just in case, then restart and boot to your recovery volume by holding Command and R before you see the Apple logo. \nEventually you'll be at a window with a few options including reinstalling Mac OS. If you're using wifi then connect to it in the top right corner of the screen. Choose the Reinstall option and follow the prompts, eventually selecting your boot drive as the Reinstall volume. \nIt might take up to a few hours but you'll have a fresh operating system while preserving your data and should get rid of the kernel issue. \n", "Q: Graphic card switching delay I got this MacBook Pro 15\" 2016 with Radeon. And every time it switches graphic cards there is a delay for like 10 seconds. \nHow do I know this? I have installed gfxCardStatus that displays a notification every time the card is switched. \nFor instance logging in to Gmail is like this, open a login page, the card is switched to Radeon 455, wait 10 sec, back to Intel HD, wait a little bit more, finally you can proceed. It becomes a real nuisance when you need quickly log in and out of different Gmail accounts as you get blocked every time you reach the login page.\nOpen a gfx editor... wait again. You get the idea. It only works okay when connected to an external monitor and Radeon is always in use. \nApparently, this is not something everybody is dealing with because I don't see people complaining left and right. Should the switching be pretty seamless? \nThere seem to be less delay when it falls back to Intel HD, but switching to Radeon is unbearable. If I open, say, a graphics editor, the cursor disappears for 6-10 seconds and it looks sort of depressing as notebook hangs as well.\nIs there anything I can do to fix it? \n\nA: It was driving me crazy but in the end, after a few updates, everything went back to normal.\nIt might not switch back to the integrated card on battery even if nothing is using a dedicated one, but that is another issue.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2011 shows grey screen during boot My early 2011 MBP stopped booting up. It now shows only a grey screen after about 1/3 of the boot up process. \nI tried Verbose mode, where the last lines visible before the grey screen can be seen in the picture. \nCould it be a faulty GPU? It is a MBP from the era with defective AMD GPUs. \nSo far I never had problems with it. \n\nI've read that I can disable the AMD gpu by moving away the AMD kexts. However single user mode gives me sandbox violations if I do this. \nThe problem exists if I try to boot into Safe Mode as well.\nI have run AHT extended and get a 4MEM/9/40… error. I guess this means the RAM is bad? Now trying only one module at a time. \nWith only one module, I don't get errors. Tried three AHT passes. However I still can't boot. Not even recovery with Cmd+R. Next step: internet recovery. \nInternet recovery leads to the same grey screen and fans spinning. Next step: PRAM an SMC reset. \nSMC reset did not help either. I fear I am out of options. I guess I'll have to get the machine to a service place…\n\nA: I had the same problem. Your GPU is dead. There was a recall awhile back for my late 2011 model. Maybe Apple will honor it and repair yours for free. \n\nA: Any grace the corporation might have shown you has expired. Free repairs are not offered anymore.\nSince  all MBPs from that era are defective by design it is impossible to keep them around for the amount of time you would expect from a quality product. \nApple's usual procedure is to replace a faulty logicboard wholesale with another faulty logicboard. This is a braindead solution and only a temporary fix currently only still possible through Apple and \"Apple Authorized Service Providers\" (AASPs) in California or Turkey. Company obsolescence policy prohibits AASPs from performing a logicboard service for machines this old, and even if AASPs were willing to perform a replacement they will not get any replacement parts from Apple. \nOnly independent service providers might be able to exchange the GPU or even the whole logicboard.\nIf this machine is still around then it can be partially resurrected with a procedure like this:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/295805/251859\nThis change in software configuration bypasses the AMD GPU on boot through a forced EFI variable in NVRAM and gives you a few more usable weeks with a \"zombie\" MacBook Pro. \n", "Q: A splitter to carry more than just audio I am gradually acquiring devices that connect directly to my iPad and iPhone via the Lightning port:\n\n\n*\n\n*An iRig music keyboard\n\n*An iCirround IShowFast 32 GB memory stick (double-ended with Lightning and USB plugs)\n\n*An M-Audio UNO MIDI interface\n\n*A Behringer UCA222 stereo audio line i/o interface\n\n\nI am also very new to IoT and started to learn tech BASIC, and have no idea whether or not what I want to accomplish can be done.\nHere is the issue. When I have any of these accessories plugged in, I can not keep my iPhone or iPad powered or charging. The problem is similar to the Lightning headphones issue with the iPhone 7.  \nBut Apple has now created a Lightning splitter with two jacks that allows listening with Lightning earphones while charging. I ordered one, but found that Apple did not provide a full data interface jack in the splitter - the data side only passes audio.\nThe iPad is popular with musicians, but they have to be super-careful that they start live or studio sessions with a full charge, because all the time they are running their device with a music interface occupying the Lightning port, their battery is discharging!\nWhile this may be a lost opportunity for Apple, it got me thinking, I would like to build one, but first I have no idea if someone else may have already done so, and if not, how would I begin? \nHas anyone ever tried to build a device that can not only pass audio, but data as well? Like plugging my device into my iMac or Air Book to access iTunes? Or being able to copy data to/from my memory stick?\nWhat is the best way to do this? Materials I will need? \nThe image is just a mockup of what I think the final product might look like, but I am flexible.\n\n\nA: While doing my research, and before that another programmer did his research and asked me, I found some workarounds, but nothing was out there that addressed the specific answer on how to use the power or \"lightning\" port for other than music or audio files.\nI mean, it should be able to handle data, like my documents, spreadsheets, text files, and such, as it does so when I connect my iPad to my iMac when doing backups. It transfers more than just music. \nAfter weeks of my own research, I needed an expert as none have come forward. I felt this question was important enough to anyone looking to either get in on the hardware side or programming side of IoT, or both. And I was right.\nSo I asked Mike Westerfield, owner of ByteWorks, developer of techBASIC, and literally wrote the book (in fact several) on IoT the same question. He is trying to finish his new book, but he took the time this morning to reply:\n\nI really have no idea if this can be done or not. In theory, of\n  course, it’s possible — but Apple has always locked the physical\n  hardware ports on iOS devices, requiring participation in the MFi\n  program, use of Apple’s proprietary chips, and testing that I’ve been\n  told averages about $10K per device to bring a product to market. You\n  might be able to get around these issues for what is essentially a\n  power supply coupled through the other port, but I don’t know enough\n  about the hardware to answer that question off of the top of my head.\nMike Westerfield\n\nResearching Apple's MFi program explains why the IoT is so limited in its scope, and why I was told that no one can answer this question. Like those who develop IOS apps, you need to join the MFi developer's program, and if you write an app to use the hardware, then you need to join both. Plus the MFi devices requires royalties to be paid to Apple.\nHowever, royalty information is only available to those who sign a Non Disclosure Agreement. But if you are accepted into the program, all the schematics, chips, etc. are available for you to use and test with. That's putting it simply. The complete program, for anyone interested is in the link above and the one following.\nWhat is not part of the MFi program? According to Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Accessories that do not use any of the MFi licensed technology listed\nabove are not part of the MFi Program. For example:  \n\n*Accessories that use only standard Bluetooth profiles supported by\niOS \n\n*Accessories that use only Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) (note:\nBTLE-enabled HomeKit accessories and BTLE-enabled MFi Hearing Aids\nare part of the MFi Program) \n\n*Accessories that connect to an Apple device through the headphone\njack and do not use any MFi licensed technology\n\n*Non-electronic cases\nThis is why IoT is only spoken about as a hobby and like Mike said, to get around this would mean a power supply (not from the Apple device) using another port, for no one, not even on the Internet has come forward with a solution to transmit anything from sensor data to data stored in a cloud to the Lightning port. Otherwise, this question would have had an answer long ago.\nBefore you hobbyist freak out, according to Apple, as long as you use existing technology, that even includes the Lightning port, you do not need to join the MFi. For example, Apple states if you are any one of the below, you do not qualify to join the MFi:\nI want to develop cases for iPhone, iPad or iPod. Do I need to join the MFi Program?\nNo. If you intend to develop a case which does not connect electronically to iPhone, iPad or iPod using licensed technology, you do not need to join the MFi Program. For information regarding case development, please visit: http://developer.apple.com/resources/cases/.\nI want to develop an accessory that communicates with an Apple device using only Bluetooth Low Energy. Do I need to join the MFi Program?\nNo. Accessories which connect to an Apple device using only Bluetooth Low Energy/BTLE/Bluetooth 4.0 or standard Bluetooth profiles supported by iOS are not part of the MFi Program.\nI want to develop an iOS app that communicates with an MFi accessory. Do I need to join the MFi Program?\nNo. iOS app developers do not need to join the MFi Program. Everything app developers need is in the External Accessory Framework, which is provided in the iOS SDK. To access the iOS SDK, please join the iOS Developer Program: https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/.\nI want to source/sell MFi accessories as finished goods. Do I need to join the MFi Program?\nNo. You do not need to join the MFi Program in order to source and/or sell MFi accessories as finished goods. However, you must source MFi finished goods from an MFi Manufacturing Licensee. The Manufacturing Licensee will be authorized to develop/manufacture goods sold under your company's brand and will take responsibility for all program requirements on your company's behalf. The Manufacturing Licensee will also be authorized to include the MFi logo on the product packaging and user guide of your accessory, once it has completed the necessary program requirements.\nI want to develop an MFi accessory for personal use. Can I join the MFi Program?\nNo. We recommend that you use a third-party hobbyist solution which will allow you to connect iOS devices to serial devices and to write iOS apps that communicate with these serial devices.\nI want to teach students about developing MFi accessories. Can I join the MFi Program?\nNo. The information shared under the MFi Program is Apple Confidential and not intended to be used in an academic setting.\nSo far the Lightning port has been built or allowed to around the music industry, which include Lightning headphones and direct connectivity (From iConnectivity) from the Lightning port to USB Inline iOS connection cable (USB Type B) gives the ability to use your Lightning iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch as a part of your iConnectMIDI rig. Plugging in your synthesizer or sound module app into your performances and recordings. Even musical instruments.\nHowever, an article from Fox News states that Iphone8 is doing away with the Lightning port in favor of the USB Type C interface, a new industry standard.\nAnd that's not all.

It errors out with \"Syntax Error A class name can’t go after this identifier.\" pointing to active tab. So, do shell script \"grep \" & var1 & \"path-to-my-file/file\" could't possibly work as written anyway!\nA proper way to get the URL would be:\ntell application \"Safari\" to get the URL of current tab of window 1 of application \"Safari\"\n\nOr to set it to a variable, use:\ntell application \"Safari\" to set theURL to (get the URL of current tab of window 1 of application \"Safari\")\n\nSo, the first two lines of code in your question would work if used like:\ntry\n    tell application \"Safari\" to set theURL to (get the URL of current tab of window 1 of application \"Safari\")\n    do shell script \"grep \" & quoted form of theURL & \" /path/to/target/file\"\nend try\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note there is a space after the double-quote before /path/to/target/file and this space is necessary.\n\n*Also the code is wrapped in a try statement to trap any errors. Although you'd need to add additional code to process the error(s) accordingly using an on error handler. While the try statement will hide an error, using it in conjunction with an on error handler will be necessary if grep doesn't find a match and you want to do additional processing based on the results from the grep command not finding a match.\nIf you really want to do it without setting the URL to a variable, then use this method:\ntry\n    do shell script \"grep $(osascript -e 'tell application \\\"Safari\\\" to get the URL of current tab of window 1 of application \\\"Safari\\\"')\" & \" /path/to/target/file\"\nend try\n\nNote that in this case the necessary space can be as shown, after the double-quote before the pathname, or it can be placed after the closing parentheses of $(...) and before the closing double-quote prior to the ampersand, e.g: ...\\\"Safari\\\"') \" &\n", "Q: Can I install Mac OSX Sierra on USB drive? I have an early 2011 MacBook Pro. I want to try Sierra as most of the software I want to use no longer works on Mavericks. I went through a number of post that I can install Sierra on 8 GB USB drive but that turned out only to be a macOS installer thumb drive.\nI am interested in installing Sierra on USB drive just to test drive it and to run my favorite software. I bought 16 GB USB for that purpose but only found out it cannot be installed there for lack of space.\nCan somebody guide me, can I have Sierra USB Image that I can load on USB and test drive it or can I install it on USB and run Sierra from it whenever I want it.\n\nA: You certainly can install macOS Sierra to a USB device. I would advise you use USB 3 or 3.1 in order to ensure a smoother experience while booted from this device.\nFirst of all, use the Mac App Store installer for macOS Sierra, which you can get here: get macOS Sierra.

I have installed High Sierra onto a bog-standard Sandisk Cruser 32GB flash drive (2014 Mac Mini). It takes several hours to install with absolutely no output onscreen; I initially thought it had hung. Once booted, its quite usable.\n\nA: I too am attempting this on the very same model of machine. I have found that it is possible to install directly to the flash drive without a second USB installer. \nHowever, it took on order of 8 hours to complete. And running the OS was excruciatingly slow. I find this confusing as I have installed that OS on a USB external hard drive with no issues and only a very slight slowdown booting over USB from that drive. \nMakes me wonder if Apple is deliberately hobbling flash drive installs. Or perhaps there is some sort of accelerator that is missing for flash drive boot volumes.\n\nA: Interesting question.

The receipe isn't as simple as I thought.\n\n\n*\n\n*From Pages export files to plain text:\nFile > Export > Plain Text...\nso as to get 2 files: file.1.txt, file.2.txt.\n\n*Open both files with vi and apply the following command:\n:%s,⌃+V⌃+M,⌃+V⌃+M,g\nthis command contains twice the sequence control+V, control+M which is the way to enter the raw return character. The strange effect of this command is to replace any return character (0x0d) with a standard newline character (0x0a) everywhere (g = global). Then the 2 files are now splitted in different lines and it becomes useful to compare them with any Unix text tool.\n\n*Change the 2 files encoding:\n:set fileencoding=utf-8\nso as to encode them as text files (and not binary files as they were exported from Pages).\n\n*Save the two files and quit vi:\n:wq\n\n*Run the standard diff command to compare the 2 text files:\ndiff file.1.txt file.2.txt\n", "Q: Triple Boot Mac OS Sierra, Windows 10, Kali Linux 2.0 On A Macbook Pro I have successfully dual booted both Window and Mac OS as well as Kali and Mac OS. The problem is installing Kali once I have dual boot Windows and Mac OS. I have tried several tutorials, and the one that got me the furthest was here. Once I had windows and Mac OS dual booted, from within Windows I shrunk the Windows partition to 128gb, and created a 32gb for partition for Kali, a 32gb one for swap, and 32gb for a shared file folder between all three OSs. I then tried installing Kali with the GRUB boot loader. No errors occurred, then when booting with rEFInd I selected the Linux partition, only to receive an error saying \"missing operating system.\" I then deleted all of the partitions, reinstalled Windows and then tried installing Kali without the GRUB boot loader. This did not work any better. Windows still gave the 0xc000000e with the \"preparing to repair\" message, and Kali still said it was missing the OS. I know this doesn't pertain entirely to Apple, as it involves Linux and Windows, but has anyone successfully done this before? \nThis is my laptop. It has a 500gb SSD, and 16gb of RAM. \n\nA: I sugest the  easiest  way is to instal Mac and windows as you have done before make the partition etc then when you go to install Grub there is an option where to install it. install to the partition where the linux installation is (take note during partitioning the location) this way the boot partition doesn't get edited and often it cant be on new systems except by the host OS. then make a bootable usb with supergrub2 to boot linux this way when osx updates or anything else decides to write to EFI your ok. this still gives you the option to direct refind or whatever bootmanager to grub\n", "Q: When was the compact cube charger introduced for the iPhone? Does anyone know when the compact cube charger was introduced for the iPhone? \nI am looking for an official source, either from Apple's website or an industry magazine / web article.\nIt was 2008 at the latest; I did find an Apple webpage on the 2008 recall of the AC mains prongs coming loose.\n\nA: The cube charger was released with the iPhone 3G on July 11, 2008. A review of the 3G mentions it:\n\nThe plug is pleasantly smaller than on the original iPhone's, but it's compatible with a standard USB cable.\n\n", "Q: How to block an airport device from connecting? So I have recently been noticing my neighbor's Apple TV has been showing up under my list of audio output options under \"preferences.\"  I wanted to see if there was a way to remove it from from the menu.  I have a mac with Yosemite 10.10.1.  I don't really have any need for airplay, just need to be able to use wif.  \nThank you so much in advance!\n\nA: The reason this is showing up is that you're on the same network. If this is meant to be a shared network, I'm afraid there's nothing you can do about this, however if it is not supposed to be a shared network, your neighbor probably has your wifi password and you need to change it in your router's settings. The process for doing so varies from router to router, so you should look up these directions yourself. \n", "Q: On iPhone 6+ my text message shows my husbands name as sender, not mine How do I have my name show as text message sender?\nI have tried Settings, messages but have not found the place to change it. \n\nA: The recipient has an address book entry of your number and/or email address with your husband's name.

I've been trying to get Ionic push notifications to work on my TestFlight app for beta-testing for weeks now and I still have not managed to implement them successfully. When I build for release via Xcode, everything works fine. I have double-checked to ensure that the necessary certificates are set up fine yet for some reason however, push notifications fail to be received (though device token registration works fine) on TestFlight.\nI have read many conflicting answers on forums, documentations and tutorials stating that an Ad-hoc provisioning profile is needed for TestFlight while others state that a distribution profile must be used. First of all, somehow the Ad-hoc profile does not attach with the build when I Archive and try to upload onto TestFlight via Xcode. Second of all, I have managed to upload on TestFlight using the Distribution profile but the push notifications are not received. I am now stumped on how I have to get push notifications to work on TestFlight.\nMy question is: which provisioning profile has to be used for a TestFlight app and what could be the reason why it is not working? Thank you.\n\nA: Since Testflight has been integrated in the App Store / iTunes Connect, you'll need to upload it to iTunes Connect, which means you need an App Store provisioning profile, not an Ad-Hoc one. I can imagine that older tutorials, made when Testflight was a stand-alone platform, still describe the situation were an Ad-Hoc provisioning profile was necessary.\nAs for the push notifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*are you sure you use the Production environment of APN (the Sandbox environment only works for debug builds)?\n\n*do you get any error messages (on the server) when sending the push notifications?\n\n*if you call the Feedback service of APN, do the devices appear there?\n\n\nA: I have few questions for you,\n\n\n*\n\n*Did you check push notification getting to your device in developing mode?\n\n*Did you deployed .pem/p12 file in the backend setup for distribution mode?\n\n\nIf you have done with both of them and still con't proceed, then there might be problem with any of the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Unchecked your testing devices when generating Ad-hoc Provisioning Profile  .\n\n*Problem while exporting p12 file or generating .pem file.\n\n*Try validating your build before uploading it to the Testflight.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to restart an iPhone or iPad instead of just \"power off\"? That's because currently, you have to press Home button and see the turning wheel for the shut down, and then wait, and then start the iPhone or iPad again.  Is there an obvious or hidden secret method to just restart (or reboot) it?\nP.S. the current Android 7.0 actually has this option, and is handy if I can just choose it and not look at it or walk away and 1 minute later it is all ready to use.\n\nA: Actually there is a way in restarting an iOS device.

Hold down Home button and lock button for a few seconds and your device will restart.\n\nA: Nope, as of iOS 10 there is no way to just restart iOS without shutting it down and powering it back up or jailbreaking the device.\n", "Q: compressord starting up every time I turn on my MacBook I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) running macOS 10.12.3 and have Compressor 4.3 installed. Every time when I restart my Mac, there are 2 processes called compressord, and CompressorHelper that got automatically started and causing my MacBook to use the discrete graphics card (which consumes a lot of battery power). One way to get rid of them is to open Compressor and quit it afterward. But it is annoying since every time I startup my Mac I need to do this process.\nIs there a way to stop these two processes from opening up every time I start up my Mac? (Possibly without reinstalling Compressor as that takes up a very long time to do for me)\n\nA: This problem cropped up for me when I used Compressor after not having used it in a long time. I've found that if I launch and quit Compressor after starting my computer then the process goes away but I haven't yet figured out how to make it stop running on boot.\n\nA: The first place to check is your login items under Users and Groups -> your username in System Preferences. If Compressor isn't in the login items list then look in your LaunchAgents folder at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ . If you decide to go the second route, make sure to only delete the compressor launch agent.\nNote: I don't know what compressor is exactly so this may not be the most accurate.\n\nA: No, the solution resides in here\n/Applications/Compressor.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems\nThere's what keeping your GPU on all the time through the 'compressord' process.\n\nA: In Compressor, go to Preferences > Advanced > Reset Queue... \nFrom there, try both Reset Queue and Repair Compressor. \n", "Q: Silhouette of full screen app using mission control stuck on screen I was trying to move a full screen app from my external monitor to the macbook screen after activating mission control by dragging and dropping.

What is the best way to run an Applescript when my current location's status changes from night to day and day to night?\nThanks!\n\nA: Never used this, but it looks like Power Manager should be able to do it. You can make sun based actions similar to automator. \nIt doesn't seem like it has a feature built in to figure out your location automatically though. So if you're like flying from country to another and want it to automatically figure it out, you probably can't do that.\nThey have a tutorial: How to Power On Your Mac at Sunrise\n.\n\n\nA: First of all, to get your current location on the command line, download \"LocateMe\" from here.\nUnpack the zip file and find the executable LocateMe inside, which you can either move to e.g. /usr/local/bin/ to make it globally accessible, or put it anywhere else. \nTo get your local sunrise/sunset times, you can use the free api from sunrise-sunset.org/api together with the LocateMe format option -f to generate your api url:\n/path/to/LocateMe -f \"http://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat={LAT}&lng={LON}\"\nwhich should return something like http://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat=52.068545&lng=12.126213\nAs the sunrise-sunset api returns json data, you can use python to parse it. Simply create two small shell scripts with the following contents:\n#!/bin/bash\ncurl -s $(/path/to/LocateMe -f \"http://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat={LAT}&lng={LON}\") | python -c \"import sys, json; print json.load(sys.stdin)['results']['sunrise']\"\n\nfor the sunrise and \n#!/bin/bash\ncurl -s $(/path/to/LocateMe -f \"http://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat={LAT}&lng={LON}\") | python -c \"import sys, json; print json.load(sys.stdin)['results']['sunset']\"\n\nfor the sunset times.\nNow you can simply call them from AppleScript via:\nset sunrise to do shell script \"/path/to/sunrise_script.sh\"\nset sunset to do shell script \"/path/to/sunset_script.sh\"\n\nand you have the sunset time as a variable inside AppleScript, where you can use them, for example, by comparing them with (time string of (current date)).\n", "Q: Sourcing and opening multiple files of same name, in specified folder, in Terminal?

Is there a way to source all of the 'image_a' files, and open them via command line? Or write a script/run a function that does?\nThis part may be irrelevant, but they're NIfTI gzip (.nii.gz) files that I'll open via FSLview. The syntax to open a single image is\nfslview </file>\n\n\nA: It depends on whether fslview accepts several filenames at once and does the right thing based on that (the documentation/man page should have more details on this). If yes, you can run\ncd folder\nfslview data*/image_a\n\nto have it open all files at once. If no, you can use\ncd folder\nfor f in data*; do fslview \"$f\"/image_a; done\n\nor\ncd folder\nfor f in data*/image_a; do fslview \"$f\"; done\n\ninstead (the second option works better if there are data X directories which don't contain image_a).\nPS: For a test run, replace fslview with echo fslview to see which command(s) would be executed.\n\nA: Try each of these\nfslview image_a*\n\nopen image_a*\n\n", "Q: Disk Utility \"First Aid\" says \"Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting\" after clean install My Mac Mini (Mac Mini 3,1 at OS 10.11.6) shows this after a \"successful\" run of First Aid from Disk Utility on the internal HD (i.e. not just the main volume, the entire HD) \"Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting.\" I have run First Aid from regular partition and recovery partition. Subsequent runs of First Aid don't show the \"Problems\" message, but if I run Disk Util after a reboot, \"Problems were found...\" message reappears. Internal HD is a Crucial SSD. Disk Util run on main volume shows no such messages. \nI very recently erased and installed original OS on the internal HD using the OE install DVD (10.5, hit C key at boot), then upgraded to 10.6 using OE DVD, then to 10.11.6 using App Store. Then I recovered from a Time Machine backup saved on an external HD. \nI worry this \"Problems were found...\" message is a time bomb. I am surprised this problem persists after I erased the HD and did a clean install of the OS.  \nQuestions: \n\n\n*\n\n*What does a recurrent \"Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting\" message mean practically?\n\n*Should I run other tests on my SSD and/or replace it? What are those tests?\nOverall, Mac works fine except I can't run AHT at boot (not from OE install DVD #2 with D key, nor using Option key to select that DVD or to select AHT on a theoretically bootable USB flash drive with AHT). These failed boot attempts go to gray screen of death, but Mini boots up fine after powering down.  \nBackground: Mini had RAM problems, but couldn't run AHT from original install disk #2 (Leopard 10.5), nor from USB flash drive (Previously discussed here: AHT problems). I tried a PRAM reset, which corrupted my main HD, but I managed to erase and do a clean install from OE disk (10.5) and recover Time Machine backup from an external HD (Discussed here: PRAM crisis) \n\nA: I created a bootable external HD running 10.11.6 and I can boot from it. I also erased my internal and reinstalled 10.11.6 on my internal SSD. I booted to the external after selecting it as Startup Disk in Sys Prefs, and ran Disk Utility on the internal. Afterward, I no longer get the message \"Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting.\" Phenomenon of Mac momentarily \"going into neutral\" described above also appears resolved (based on 30 minutes of use, anyway). Soon I will boot to external and rerun Disk Util to recheck for errors on internal.

But we use a pager application for work, and I want that application to still be able to notify me and make noises.\nHow do I do that? I can only figure out how to allow contacts to not be in do not disturb mode.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you cannot (on a non-jailbroken device).  There is currently no iPhone feature available to exempt a specific application from either Silent or Do Not Disturb mode.\n\nA: If the device is jailbroken, you can use Banner Sounds to allow certain notifications which match filters you configure the ability to bypass Do Not Disturb.\n\nA: As of iOS 13, the only way you can do this without jail breaking is to set up your pager application to send SMS or make phone calls, then you can set up a contact to bypass silent mode and Do Not Disturb. \n\nA: Similarly to this answer about syncing Do Not Disturb mode across devices, this answer appears outdated as well.\nYou can now, with Apple's Focus Feature, allow certain applications or certain users to create and trigger notifications that will display and sound for you in your chosen focus. This has to obviously be configured in settings but is absolutely possible.\nHere is the official Apple Information as of September, 2022. It will naturally go out of date in a few years when all these tech companies feel like slapping another new coat of paint on top of all of their old work.\n\nSet up your Focus.

It also shows up in the bluetooth list with the bluetooth icon, rather than a keyboard icon like other keyboards. And in keyboard settings, I am unable to adjust the modifier keys, as I can with other keyboards. \nAny ideas how to fix this?\n\nA: macOS Sierra does not fully recognize the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard as a keyboard, but a workaround exists.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Karabiner Elements. It lets you intercept and remap keyboard input.\n\n*Launch Karabiner Elements and go to the Devices tab and uncheck everything but \"Ergonomic Keyboard\" so that Karabiner does not swap keys with any other keyboards attached to your computer. \n\n*Switch to the \"Simple Modifications Keys\" tab. Click the \"add item\" button. Remap \"left_command\" to \"left_option\" and \"left_option\" to \"left_command\". Then do the same for \"right\" command/option keys.\n\n\nA: It appears that the keyboard is not compatible with macOS.  The Surface Ergonomic Keyboard doesn't list compatibility with any OS other than Windows 10 and specifically, the Surface line of products.  Basically, there is no macOS driver for this particular keyboard.\n\nThis is unlike their more generic Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard which specifically lists alternate OSes including macOS and Android (though with limited functionality).\n\nA: I use my surface ergonomic keyboard with macOS.  The only thing I found tricky was that you need to hit the enter key after typing in the code.\n\nA: I use Mac running High Sierra as of this writing, and saw an issue with Mac not getting all the keystrokes and also, my mouse would jump around. I have two offices, exact same setup. This does not happen at one, but does from my home office. \nI noticed the difference was that at home, I had an external HDD plugged in also. This is the only variation of the two setups. Once I removed this, and plugged my dongle back in, the issue went away. (I have tried to remove dongle, and plug back in, also move closer to my keyboard and mouse (was 14 inches away).\nIt seems like the issue may be related to the usb ports being under powered or over utilized. Anyway, unplugging my external drive fixed the issue for me. \n\nA: On my iMac running High Sierra, IntelliType 8.2 suddenly stopped recognizing my MSFT Ergonomic 4000 keyboard. One day it was working fine, not the next. After attempting everything, including reinstalling the OS, I finally called Apple Support (MSFT Support had been useless).\nI was fortunate to get a great guy, Andrew B in North Carolina. He figured out what we had to do. The culprit was Apple's \"System Integrity\" patch, which they added to their OS starting with El Capitan. The solution was to turn it off. Here's how:\n1- Launch Terminal and enter: csrutil disable  Then hit Enter.\n2- Restart\n3- Reinstall your keyboard/mouse driver (must do this!)\n4- Restart, and all should be AOK!\nAndrew recommends turning System Integrity back on following Steps 1 & 2, using \"... enable\" in Terminal.

On the old iPhone I have a banking app which I'd like to copy securely to the new iPhone, including all the app's data. I do not want to make a full backup. Both devices are using the same credentials for iCloud, none of the devices is jailbroken.\nThe app does not use iCloud.\nIs it possible to copy only this single app without using third party software? \n\nA: Given the way online banking is designed you shouldn't need to copy local data for the app, as the app is usually just a client for their website. You should be able to simply download a fresh copy of the app on your newer iPhone, sign in to the app, and load all of the necessary data from their servers (recent deposits/withdrawls/transfers, share account info etc. would all be kept on their end and simply sent to your phone temporarily over the network when the app requested it, unless that is your bank uses a very unorthodox device-locked system, which seems both unlikely as well as unreasonable behaviour for a bank.).\n\nA: If the app uses iCloud to backup/use its data and the 10.2 version of the app can read the data from the 8.2 version (you can contact the app developer to verify), then you should be able to just download the banking app and use the old data. \nFor example, I've used many apps on my iPhone's on versions all the way back to iOS6.  With each new iPhone I setup as 'new', the apps that are designed to use the iCloud data simply work.  Of course, I have to make sure I perform a backup of that specific app's data to iCloud before I upgrade, and you'll want to do that too.\nI'm very happy with how many well-written apps are using iCloud.  I know that many other people don't have the same experience.  It looks like you're able to use both iPhones at the same time so you should be able to test and make sure your data looks good on the new one before making the permanent switch. \n", "Q: Pasting images from clipboard in Safari On Windows (Chrome, Firefox) I was used to copying a picture to the clipboard and to paste it for example into the message composition section of facebook or vkontakte. On Mac OS X this does not seem to work, neither in Safari nor in Chrome. In order to send a screenshot as message, I now need to take the screenshot, save it and navigate to the corresponding location in the file open dialog.\n\nIs there a workaround, third-party program or setting to manage this on a Mac?\n\nA: I know you can copy images in Firefox, as far as Chrome goes I haven't used it in years. With Safari however if you are talking about still images you should be able to Command-C an image. If that doesn't work you could always \"Copy Image Location\"/\"Copy Image Address\" in either Firefox or Safari, then open Preview and choose to open the URL you just copied. From there you can use the normal Select/Command-C/Command-V to paste whatever section of the image you'd like into any other system app that displays images (i.e. iMessage via the attach feature). That would at least eliminate the need for using Grab, however if you are okay with it you could also simply save the image itself temporarily, click the Attachment button, drag and drop the image from your downloads fan/folder and delete it when you're done.\n\nA: Safari 10.1 was released today and fixes this issue.

Just keep calling the older version or use a tool like pyenv to juggle which is preferred if you don’t like or care to control your path.\nYou may have multiple versions of Python 3.x installed on your Mac. To uninstall all of them, first check which are installed:\nbrew list | grep python\n\nLet's say you have 3.9 and 3.7 installed. To remove 3.9, run this command:\nbrew uninstall python@3.9\n\nTo remove 3.7, just replace 3.9 with 3.7 above.\n\nA: It depends on how you installed python3.\nIf you installed python3 via the official mac installer(.dmg), you need to remove it from Finder -> applications. Just drag the python3.x icon to the Trash icon on the bottom right corner. If you had installed several versions of python3, you may find more than one python3.x icons, each one corresponds to a single python3 version instance, you may choose which one to remove.\nIf you installed python3 via a package manager like brew, you need to use the remove command from the package manager, for example, brew uninstall python3.\n\nA: Try\npyenv:\nTo get all installed versions:\npyenv versions \n\nTo get uninstall specific version\npyenv uninstall 3.5.0\n\nSimilarly to install specific version\npyenv install 2.7.10\n\n\nA: If you used homebrew to install python3 the command to remove it is\nbrew rmtree python3\n\nYou should be able to have both versions installed. Call your scripts via\n python myScript.py\n\nThis will use your python2.7. If you want to use python3 the command would be\npython3 myScript.py\n\n\nA: If the python3 location is in /usr/bin/python3 then you won't be able to delete it directly, macOS may throw an error like “Operation not permitted” or “read only file system” etc, because macOS mounts the system files as a read-only partition and use a mechanism called system integrity protection (csrutil).\nTo remove the file you need to do the the following steps,\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the Mac OS into recovery mode\n\n*Open disk utility\n\n*Unmount “Macintosh HD” and mount again\n\n*Open terminal from utilities\n\n*Run command 'csrutil disable'\n\n*Remove the file from 'rm /volumes/macintosh\\ hd/usr/bin/python3'\n\n*Run command 'csrutil enable'\n\n*Reboot the OS again\n\n", "Q: App won't delete.

That said the best way to rid yourself of these things is to back up your phone to iTunes (password protect your backup so the backup saves your passwords stored on the phone). Then go into Settings -> General -> reset -> Erase all Contents and Settings.\nThe phone will do its thing and once it has come back up, plug it back into the computer and restore the phone from the backup you just made.\nIt's an annoying process to have to go through, but so far have found no other way to do it.\n", "Q: Where can I find all the documentation for mac's builtin shell commands?

Here's the scenario- My friend destroys his 12\" 2015 retina display macbook (model A1534) and I tell him I can replace the display for him if he buys a new display assembly. However, the display he purchased to replace the old one is a newer, 2016 rose gold edition (still model A1534, though). There are minor differences in the display cables but nothing that hinders the new display from hooking into the logicboard. However, when it is all set up the screen remains black after the start-up chime.  \nIs is possible that these two parts are incompatible, or must it be the case that I've done something wrong during reassembly (or the new display was Dead on arrival)? Specifically, I am looking at the MacBook 12\" Retina Timing Controller (TCON) Board Flex Cable, if anything is inhibiting the computer from working it is probably a connection difference with this cable, which is still being used from the original, as the new one did not come with one.\nElse, I am wholeheartedly open to suggestions/advice on how to proceed. \nhttp://imgur.com/a/AUvD2< Pictures of the setup and differences between the models.\n\nA: Just an update, I ordered a new Retina Timing Controller (TCON) Board Flex Cable and replaced the old one and the computer is back to perfect condition.  I thought this would be the case since I had a lot of trouble removing it from the original display assembly AND since after the original damage the screen was still getting power (light), but unable to display anything, however after going back and putting the original, damaged display on after the new one didn't get any power, the damaged one wasn't getting power either.\n", "Q: Deleting Local Backup Last Week I found that the local backup took about 20-30 GB free space on my MacBook Air and I deleted them using:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nI weekly backup my notebook using my external harddrive with Time Machine.

The glass was cracked and the other iPhone was water damage but screen was working fine. Moved of course the home button over. I know Apple is hardening down on non-original parts so I was surprised when the fixed phone had a warranty issue and Apple replaced the device. So they either did not check the screen carefully enough or it was ok. Not to say this would work again but they would nowadays be very quick to hit down on a non-original screen. A couple of years ago I could fix an iPhone 5 with a 3rd party screen and get the iPhone replaced on a warranty issue (bad headphone).

How can I let my Mac automate this task? Do I need additional software to do this?\n\nA: I've done this using the Coherent PDF Command Line Tools Community Release.\nYou can download either the pre-built tools or the source code to compile the later on your own, however the latter requires OCaml be installed when compiling. So the pre-built tools are the easiest way to go. The downloaded distribution file, e.g. cpdf-binaries-master.zip, contains binaries for Linux, OS X/macOS and Windows and is ~5 MB in size.\nOnce downloaded and extracted (double-clicking the .zip file) you'd copy the, e.g. ~/Downloads/cpdf-binaries-master/OSX-Intel/cpdf, file to a location that is defined in the PATH environment variable, e.g. /usr/local/bin/ to make it globally available on the command line in Terminal. If it's not in the PATH then you'll have to use the fully qualified pathname to the cpdf executable or ./cpdf if it's in the present working directory (pwd). In Terminal, type echo $PATHso show the PATH.\nThe syntax for removing the last page when the PDF file has 3 or more pages is:\ncpdf in.pdf 1-~2 -o out.pdf\n\nThe syntax for removing the last page when the PDF file has 2 pages is:\ncpdf in.pdf 1 -o out.pdf\n\nBecause cpdf reads the original file (in.pdf) and writes to a new file (out.pdf) the out.pdf filename needs to be different if saved to the same location as the in.pdf file, or save it to a different location with the same in.pdf filename as the out.pdf filename, or whatever out.pdf filename you want.\nBelow, I'll show two examples of automation using cpdf to remove the last page of a PDF file, assuming it has two or more pages.

But I am having trouble with hidden files. Is there a special way to do this?\nset home_path to (path to home folder as text)\nset hiddenFile to home_path & \".test\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if not (exists file hiddenFile) then\n        display dialog \".test does not exist.\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nA: Replace Finder with System Events:\nset home_path to (path to home folder as text)\nset hiddenFile to home_path & \".test\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if exists file hiddenFile then\n        display dialog \".test does exist.\"\n    else\n        display dialog \".test does not exist.\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\nand it works.\n\nA: You can also inline calling the shell command inside the AppleScript without the need to create separate bash scripts. Here's an example:\nset home_path to (path to home folder as text)\nset fileName to \".viminfo\"\nset hiddenFile to home_path & fileName\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if not (exists file hiddenFile) then\n        try\n            set output to do shell script \"[ -f \" & quoted form of POSIX path of hiddenFile & \" ];\"\n        on error\n            display dialog fileName & \" does not exist.\"\n        end try\n        display dialog fileName & \" does exist.\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThis AppleScript uses bash [ -f $PATH ]; to check if file exists. It also uses try, because you have to \"catch\" an error - if file do not exist you get an error and script is stopped. \n\nA: So I don't know how to do this with native AppleScript, but because Macs use Bash, you can use a shell script to do the searching. It's not ideal but it's better than nothing.\nSo your shell script is going to cd, change directory, into the folder you need to search. Then, it'll execute the ls command, which lists the contents of a directory. the -a flag on ls tells it to list hidden items. Bash tools use a concept called standard input/output to get input and display output. The standard output is displayed on screen by default, but it can be redirected by a tool called a pipe to go somewhere else. In this case, instead of displaying a list of all the files in a directory, we're going to pipe that list into a search tool called grep. That explanation was somewhat verbose but your shell script only needs 3 lines (the first of which is arguably unnecessary in this case):\n#!/bin/bash                                   # define the shell, not really needed because bash is the default shell but good practice\ncd /path/to/search/directory                  # cd to the proper place\nls -a | grep \"the text you're looking for\"    # list all files (including hidden ones) and pipe output into grep, a search tool\n\nSave this as something logical, like findFile.sh, then make it executable with this command in the terminal app\nchmod +x /path/to/findFile.sh\n\nSo now that's ready to go, on to the AppleScript.\nLike I said I'm not that experienced in AppleScript, but as I understand it you'd run the shell script like this\nset output to do shell script \"/path/to/findFile.sh\"\n\nthen the output variable would contain any text that grep found. Your test for whether or not the file exists is now whether or not output contains any text.\nFeel free to run man grep in the terminal for the grep manual to see more about how it works and what it matches and how to only match files with certain extensions and stuff like that. Perhaps you may want to play around piping things into grep to get a feel for how it works.\nHopefully someone can come along with an answer to your question in AppleScript.\nReferences:  \n\n\n*\n\n*using shell scripts in AppleScript: http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=4913 \n\n*chmod is required to make shell scripts executable: How to run a shell script from an AppleScript?\n\n*for any of the shell commands, run man nameofcommand to learn more about them\n\n", "Q: Can I use my 1st generation iPad ans a second screen for my Mac Laptop I work from home a lot and want to create a 2nd screen for my Laptop by using my iPad.  Is this possible and if so, what hardware/software do I need to purchase\n\nA: I think you will run into problems trying to do this with a 1st generation iPad, as most software I've come across to achieve this sort of thing requires iOS 7 and a 1st generation iPad can't officially run this version of iOS.\nIn general though, if you want to use an iPad or iPhone as an extra display for your computer you will need to use 3rd party software to do this, such as Duet Display. \nI have used this app to set an iPad up as an external monitor for an iMac and it works well for some workflows. How well it works for you will depend on what you're trying to do and the hardware you're using.\nDuet Display does work with both iPads and iPhones and works with both Mac and Windows. However, I can not share any personal experience in using it with a 1st generation iPad as I think all versions of Duet Display require at least iOS 7.\nThere are also other options you can investigate, but I have no personal experience with them and don't know if they will run on a 1st generation iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Air Display\n\n*iDisplay\n\n*Mirroring360\nHopefully this answers your question one way or another.\n", "Q: Need help finding out why a file (test_find.pyc) opens at startup Like the title said, IDLE opens and runs  /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/ctypes/test/test_find.pyc every time I start my computer, but I can't figure out why.

If you run Apple Remote Desktop Admin you will notice Apple has recently released version 3.9.\nIf, as happened to me, your AppStore does not display the update to the Apple Remote Desktop Client update as well as the Apple Remote Desktop Admin upgrade, and you upgrade your Apple Remote Desktop Admin first, these bad things will happen: \n\n\n*\n\n*You will not be able to open Apple Remote Desktop Admin on your machine, because your client is not the right version.\n\n\nIf you run the AppStore again and pick up the ARD Client updater, you can open ARD Admin again, but\n\n\n*You will lose the ability to send Unix commands, install packages, etc to all computers you manage that have not yet upgraded to ARD client 3.9\nIf you upgrade your remote clients to ARD Client 3.9 by whatever means, you will get back control of them through your ARD Admin but,\n\n\n*The ARD Client version 3.9 is not compatible with any OS below Yosemite!\nIf you run clients running an OS older than Yosemite, you will only have Screen Sharing access to those clients forever more (or until a legacy patch is written).\nAnyone with Apple Remote Desktop Admin 3.8.5 can still do all of the remote goodness to ARD Clients running version 3.9. \nTL;DR, if you upgrade your Apple Remote Desktop Admin to version 3.9, you will have a bad time.\nCan anyone suggest a workaround, other than \"don't upgrade to Apple Remote Desktop Admin 3.9\"?\n\nA: One thing that helps is that there is a compatibility mode in the Security Tab of the Preferences.\n\nA: I have successfully use ARD 3.9 to connect to OS versions as old as 10.5.8 when I upgraded this week my Apple Remote Desktop control software. \nWe did decide to script an update of all 10.10.0 and above machines to ensure they are updated to 10.10.5/10.11.6/10.12.3 and then applied the ARD client 3.9 update and scripted a restart of the client on each Mac that couldn't be immediately rebooted. \nThe problem with the client update was it often opened a dialog asking for a keychain password that often couldn't be entered. If you have problems controlling any client, restart that OS or ssh into it to reconfigure and restart (kickstart) the client agent. \n/System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -restart -agent\n\nHere is a fix to this problem:\nIf you login as admin on ARD and change the preferences to allow Unix commands and other settings this fixes the problem. Basically after updating to 3.9 the settings defaulted back to the factory settings. \n\nA: This problem annoyed me too and there is actually a very easy fix. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open up ARD\n\n*Go to Preferences\n\n*Go to Security\n\n*Check the box Allow communication with older clients (less secure)\nAfter that I could send unix commands, install packages, etc to 3.8.3 and higher. I don't have anything below 3.8.3 so I couldn't test that.  \n\nA: There IS a way to make ARD 3.9 work between 2 machines running 3.9:\nInstead of using the long username (ex. \"John Smith\") use the short name (ex. \"johnsmith\"). Fixed it for me.\n", "Q: CoreStorage changed to Apple_HFS after resizing and Recovery HD popped in the middle of my disk I have a weird thing that happened today on my Mac's disk.\nI had my main partition Macintosh HD and a 150 GB Linux partition. I tried to split up the Linux partition into two smaller ones using Disk Utility (on Sierra) but it failed. \nSince then, my Recovery HD popped between the Linux partition and Macintosh HD, making me unable to delete the Linux partition: Disk Utility would then try to resize Recovery HD to 150 GB if I delete the Linux partition. \n\nIt seems Recovery HD is not hidden anymore as it should be... When I try to use cmdR at boot time it loads the Internet Necovery like if it wasn't seeing the Recovery HD partition...\n\nI've tried repairing all my disks from the Internet Recovery, it repaired errors, but it didn't seem to have changed anything to my poor alone Recovery HD partition. \nHere is the output below of diskutil list, as you can see Recovery HD is listed as Apple_HFS instead of Apple_Boot and Macintosh HD is listed as Apple_HFS instead of Apple_CoreStorage. \n\nIf anybody know what's going on, I would really appreciate the help. MacOs is booting fine and it seems I can access my data, I've checked random files. It's really really weird that Macintosh HD's type is Apple_HFS instead of CoreStorage, when I run diskutil cs list I got \"No CoreStorage logical volume groups found\".\nIt seems the Disk Utility has reverted my Macintosh HD CoreStorage containing the Recovery HD to two Apple_HFS regular partitions without my consent. How do you think I could fix that ? \n\nA: I think I fixed it.\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, you need to revert Macintosh HD into a CoreStorage using\ndiskutil cs convert /dev/disk0s2\n\n*Then, reinstall MacOs on Macintosh HD using the Sierra installer for the Mac Apple Store without loosing data, creating a new Recovery HD partition. \n\n*Lastly, erase the old Recovery HD partition labeled Apple_HFS with Disk Utility.\n", "Q: Restricting SSH access to key-based authentication only So I've successfully authenticated myself with my private key, but now I want to disable passwords all together, so I can only access it with my private key.\nI edit /etc/ssh/ssh_config and I add the following:\nPasswordAuthentication no\nPermitRootLogin no\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\nUsePAM no\n\nat the bottom of the file.

But even when I delete the Tinder app and reinstall it again, it still shows the B account logged in to the app. This means that IOS is somewhere storing a history for this app. Now I'm looking for a way to delete this history.\nNote that this question is not necessarily about a certain app, but rather about where IOS stores historical data of apps and how to delete those histories alongside with the app.\nP.S: If there are solutions like changing UUID of my i-phone that wouldn't damage my phone (I'm new to iphone so I'm not sure what I'm saying. For instance this jailbreaking thing which I keep hearing about and I'm not sure what it exactly does to my phone, doesn't sound like an I idea that I like), I'm open to them.\n\nA: Try deleting the app from within Settings and see if that makes any difference?\nMore specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Tap on General\n\n*Tap on Storage & iCloud Usage \n\n*Under the Storage heading, tap on Manage Storage\n\n*Wait for your list of apps to populate\n\n*Select Tinder\n\n*Tap on the red Delete App option\n\n*At the next prompt, tap OK\n\n*Exit Settings\n\n*Reboot your iPhone (press the Power and Home buttons for about 10 secs)\n\n\nNow reinstall the Tinder app and see whether this process has made any difference.\n", "Q: I have a program running on the diagnostics of my iPhone called JS ON and I want to know what it's doing and how can I stop at \nI have been getting hacked on my iPhone and I believe this program is doing something! I have did a factory reset many times. The program always returns??\n\nA: JSON isn't the name of a program.\nIt's the name of a data format. It's the format you see there with all the {}s and :s and things in \"s. That log file is just named \"2017-02-18T01:22:39.json\", with \".json\" at the end, sort of like how names of HTML files might end with \".html\", or names of JPEG image files might end with \".jpg\". That \".json\" is simply part of the file name, it's not the name of a program.\nIt's a pretty widely used format on computers and such, because it's easy for both humans and computers to write and read.\nNothing in your post identifies any programs or anything else. Whatever that log is you are looking at, it's in JSON format. That's all.\nSince a huge number of things on your iPhone probably output JSON-formatted text, no amount of factory resets will stop it. \"JSON\" isn't a problem and factory resets would have no impact on that, just like there isn't a program named \"JPEG\" and a factory reset won't stop your camera from saving JPEG files.\n", "Q: macOS File Vault 2 full disk encryption does not seem to work I got a used MacBook Air 11 (2014) and the first thing I did was wiping the whole drive and re-adding partitions.\nI picked OS X extended journaled encrypted which should be the same as File Vault 2\nAfter reinstalling the OS (Mavericks) I've updated all the way to macOS Sierra 10.12.3 and added a second user non-admin user account.\nNow the confusing part:\n\n\n*\n\n*When cold starting my MacBook it would go straight to the login screen without asking for the disk password (how would that happen if it's supposed to be full disk encrypted ? I'm not talking about hibernation, I've properly shut down my MacBook)\n\n*The login screen would show the non-admin account and a Disk Password option, both work as expected, but it wouldn't show my admin account\n\n*a) After entering the Disk Password the admin account would show up\n\n*b) If I decide to NOT enter the Disk Password, I can still log into the non-admin account. More over, if I then log out, my admin account would mysteriously appear and I can log into it without ever using the my disk password.\nI used the diskutil cs list command and it shows that my Logical Volume is properly wrapped in a AES-XTS encrypted Logical Volume Family\nNow the question here is, is this really working ? According to some official (maybe outdated) Apple website it should ask for the disk password on boot up, before the login screen.\n\nOutput of sudo gpt -r show disk0:\n    start       size  index  contents\n        0          1         PMBR\n        1          1         Pri GPT header\n        2         32         Pri GPT table\n       34          6         \n       40     409600      1  GPT part - XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n   409640  235298960      2  GPT part - XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n235708600    1269536      3  GPT part - XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n236978136          7         \n236978143         32         Sec GPT table\n236978175          1         Sec GPT header\n\n\n\nA: It looks like this is a misunderstanding. In the later versions of macOS it is difficult to distinguish the pre-boot unlock screen (where one unlocks the partition and is automatically logged in after the boot process) from the login screen (where the system partition is already unlocked and the user has to log into the system).\nFurthermore, FileVault2 can grant multiple passwords the right to unlock the partition and grants this permission to individual accounts. You can manage what accounts can unlock the system disk in System Preferences>Security & Privacy>Enable Users.... That means your account password also becomes the password to unlock the partition. In any case you can use the recovery password, which is provided when encrypting the disk, to unlock the partition.\nThis answer provides a method to use a unlock key that differs from your account password.\n", "Q: SourceTree: how to show commit information panel if once hide?

When you click the icon in Chrome it opens a popup that lists all open tabs by window and puts focus into a search field so you can immediately being typing a search string. As you type, the results are narrowed.

The progress bar would take forever to reach 100%, and then it would just stop there once it reached it; all the while the fan running loudly.\nI am able to boot into Recovery Mode, and I can even run Disk Utility (it doesn't detect any problems.) However, when I attempt to reinstall the OS, it tells me:\n\nThis disk has S.M.A.R.T. errors.\nThis disk has a hardware problem that can't be repaired. Back up as much of the data as possible and replace the disk.\n\nI have an outdated Time Machine backup, made before I upgraded from Mountain Lion to El Capitan. Most of the data in the backup is the same, but there are a few GBs of new files I'd like to backup as well.\nSince Disk Utility tells me everything is okay, am I able to somehow mount an external, and backup files? Possibly through Terminal? And If I were to use the drive with the old Time Machine backup on it, would I have to delete the backup before writing new data to the drive?\nI'm not very computer savvy, but I can manage my way through Terminal with a lot of instruction. So please, try to answer in terms I will understand. Thanks.\n\nA: You can use terminal to selectively backup files from your iMac, especially the files and folders in your Home folder. The cp command would be just the right tool for the job. \ncp -r -v /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/user-name/ /Volumes/Backup\nThis is the command, where /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/user-name is the source and /Volumes/Backup is the destination. The parameter -r means to copy recursively including the files inside each subdirectory. -v is to enable verbose mode, so that you can see all the details while the command is running. You would need to change the hard disk and folders name according to those inside your iMac and external drive.\nBecause it is a simple copy and paste command, you don't have to delete the backup in your Time Machine disk. Just make sure that disk has sufficient storage space for the things you want to copy.\nI personally used and found the cp command to be the fastest and most straightforward when you just want to backup the important folders in my Mac.\n\nA: Whatever you do, leave the faulty disk alone until you know what you are going to do. The risk that the disk breaks entirely any moment now is very high. \nThis answer assumes you don't have FileVault enabled.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an external backup disk that has enough capacity and connect it.\n\n*Press cmd+alt+R before the boot screen appears to enter internet recovery mode. This loads the recovery mode from the internet, which will be very slow. The advantage is that there is no stress on the faulty disk.\n\n\nMethod A – If you want to save individual files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the menu bar and select Terminal.\n\n*Copy the files you want to rescue using cp. For instance, if you have a folder rescueme on your desktop, you can use the following command: \ncp -r /Volumes/mydisk/Users/myusername/Desktop/rescueme /Volumes/mybackupdisk/\nThis will copy all files and subfolders of rescueme onto your backup drive called mybackupdisk.\nMethod B – If you want to make a full backup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the Disk Utility tool\n\n*Select the Disk that you want to back up\n\n*In the menu bar select File > New Image > Image from “mydisk”\n\n*Select your options. E.g. you may want to compress the image to save some space on the backup disk.\n\n*Press Save and wait.\n\n\nIt is likely that some parts of your disk are not readable anymore. Therefore the method B may not work and you should first try to save the most important files manually (i.e. method A).\nMethod C - if you have another Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the two computers, e.g. with a Thunderbolt cable.\n\n*On your broken iMac, press T at the boot screen to enter target disk mode.\n\n*Now you can use the Finder to browse the broken disk and copy files.\n\n", "Q: Impossible to downgrade Mac Pro's operating system to original system My Mac Pro ( late 2009 custom assembled in Ireland by Apple)\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor Name:   3.32GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon\n\n*Memory:   32 GB\n\n*Processor Interconnect Speed: 6.4 GT/s\n\n*Boot ROM Version: MP41.0081.B07\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680\n\n*VRAM (Total): 4096 MB\n\n\ncame originally with Snow Leopard.

I tried every kind of keyboards combos I am aware of.\nPeople at the local Apple store told me that I will never be able to go back to Snow Leopard as after Yosemite the system patches the computer ROM making the downgrade impossible.\nBut I do need Snow Leopard as I have a number of  PowerPC apps and files I need to use.\nAny hints please?\n\nA: You do need Snow Leapord or Tiger and below to run PowerPC apps. That is how I also got into trouble, but in my case, my iMac is no longer usable.\nI bought a spring 2008 iMAC that came with the Tiger OS which I upgraded to Snow Leapord. I also like Snow Leapord because it still runs all the old software based on technology no longer used.\nAfter I upgraded to El Capitan, I too could not install an older release. Like you, not even with a new hard drive. \nI also found out, as you may have noticed, you can't install Sierra either. That is because of an upgrade to your current OS that tells it your hardware is obsolete.\nI found this in the macrumors forum: \"Apple Obsoletes Select Early 2008 to Late 2009 Macs\"\nHere is  \"Apple's Official List of Vintage and Obsolete Products.\"\nBoth of our computers are on the list.\nSince I tried to install Snow Leapord, my iMAC refuses to boot, even in safe mode.\nHowever, I found this post on the Apple website. It is from 2013, and it may be able to help you. The article also provides the update link from Apple Support.\nThe post is \"OS X 10.4/10.5 need to upgrade, 10.6.8 ok still\" and it is by a level 7 user DS_Store.\nI hope this helps, for all my attempts at dual boot disks, external boot disk, VM's and such may have doomed my iMac for good, which means 6-8 months before I can finish designing the apps I have been developing.\n", "Q: What are these private keys?

Everything worked great however now I can't use the recovery partition anymore on the new MacBook Pro. It comes up with the \"no smoking\" symbol in white. \nThe recovery partition exists....and has data in it. Just can't boot from it. Is there any easy way to restore the recovery partition?\n\nA: Make sure you have a working backup of your data. \nYour first option is to simply reinstall macOS from internet recovery (press cmd+option+R at startup) or an external (USB) drive. \nAlternatively, this article describes the process of recreating the recovery partition. \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Download a copy of the “Install OS X” or “Install Mac OS X” from the Mac App Store under the “Purchases” tab which matches the version of system software on your Mac (for example, the “Install OS X Mavericks” app, or “Install macOS Sierra” app)\n  \n*Go to the developers website here and download the latest version of Recovery Partition Creator, it’s an AppleScript that will handle the recreation of the recovery drive\n  \n*After the app has downloaded, right-click on “Recovery Partition Creator.app” and choose “Open” to bypass Gatekeeper\n  \n*Follow the onscreen instructions, and select the primary drive you want to restore a recovery partition onto (typically Macintosh HD unless you named the drive differently, or are using a separate disk)\n  Make Recovery Partition on Mac\n  \n*Point to the Mac OS X installer application you downloaded in the first step and let the AppleScript do it’s work\n  \n*When the Recovery Partition Creator app is finished running, reboot the Mac and hold down Command+R to boot into Recovery and confirm the recovery partition now exists and works as intended\n\n\nA: Please be noted that cloning with Disk Utility will not include recovery partition.

So to fix the hyperlinks, I have to get the VP to fix it on his computer, or download a copy, fix the links, and then convince everyone to stop using the old link. This is even harder because the link is the only way to access the shared doc. So it becomes the 'use this link, not this link, is this the most upto date attachment' problem. \n\nA: So it would seem the solution is for someone to pony up and buy a Mac, since Pages is included free, these days. The Pages development team might eventually add this feature, but they haven't yet (January 25, 2018). In fact, I ended up here in an effort to solve the same issue. I have a desktop version of Pages, so I could go that route, though I'll likely just paste the URL and let Pages auto-link it. \nUpdate: Pages for iCloud does support footnotes (click the paragraph icon and choose Footnote from the options). So I've added my URLs as footnotes. That actually has some advantages--especially for people who print out documents--over hyperlinking the words themselves. \n", "Q: Possible to record audio output streaming from other apps? Looking to record any audio that streams on my device. Are there any apps that are capable of doing this for ALL audio? (Im not interested in radio station apps that record radio stations only).\nI am willing to jailbreak the phone to make this work. \nRunning ios 10.2 on iphone6 \n\nA: I don't know of anything on the phone itself but getting audio out of an iphone and onto something that can record is possible.\nUsing AirPlay and Airfoil Satellite (or your Airplay receiver of choice) you can get the audio to your Mac. Then using Audio Hijack (as mentioned by Kalamalka Kid) on your Mac you can record it. \nNot the most ideal setup but it works.\n\nA: Yes you can, using Quicktime Player, with the possible exception of certain DRM'd apps like Netflix.

While I did take advantage of that, I mainly used it in a frivolous manor. \nHowever, regardless, I've realised that there are a couple of characters in the Hebrew type case that don't come on any of the built-in keyboards for the Mac, namely the meteg, a character used to mark syllabic emphases in certain situations. My need to access this character reminded me of the above anecdote and got me wondering whether there still exists a way to create such a shortcut.\nIs it possible to create a typing shortcut as described above? If it makes a  difference, I'd be using it mainly in Pages.\n\nA: Based on your question, you're probably familiar with much of this process but I'll lay it out from start to finish just in case.\nIn System Preferences > Keyboard > Text, add an item. On the left, pick a shortcut sequence. On the right, you need to enter the desired character. There are a variety of ways to do this here but one straightforward way to do so would be to Show Emoji and Symbols†, enter the character name (e.g. meteg) in the search field and then double-click on the result‡. This will place the character wherever the cursor would be, which in this case, should be in the 'With' field in the Text preferences.\nFrom within Pages (or TextEdit) enable Edit > Substitutions > Text Replacement. When done, there should be a checkmark beside the option. As far as I can tell, this setting will stick as long as it's a standard Cocoa app.\nTo use in Pages, open a doc and type the shortcut and hit space (or some punctuation character).\n† I have 'Show Input menu in menu bar' checked in the Keyboard > Input Sources preferences so I typically grab the 'symbols' from there. But if you don't have that enabled, and don't want to, you can select 'Emoji & Symbols' from the Edit menu of most standard apps.\n‡ Other methods might be to enable the appropriate script in the Symbols and Emojis window, or to paste the character from wherever you might find it.\n\nA: You could easily make a custom layout which includes the extra characters you need with the Ukelele app.\n", "Q: How can I control the audio chain within macOS? I have an audio signal coming into the Mac from an audio interface. I want to be able to control the signal flow within the Mac, routing the signal through different applications, in the order I want it to, before going out from the Mac back into the audio interface.\n\nA: Loopback from Rogue Amoeba (not free unfortunately) can do this by creating several virtual interfaces that take audio from what ever input or application you want. \nYou should be able to chain them together to achieve the desired effect\nLoopback is not free however. \nAnother option would be Soundflower.

I'm guessing no. \nApple changed the policy on ARD a while ago. It went from 'serial number' to App Store, & any existing ARD on the machine should have been 'upgraded' to that at the time. Mine was showing as purchased, but not available as an update.  \nThe App Store app was showing it as 'Open' which it wouldn't because the client had already updated to 3.9, which sent me back to the App Store -  so I was locked in an infinite loop\nMy fix was to trash the app [or zip it & trash] then go to it in the App Store https://itunes.apple.com/app/id409907375 which then showed it as 'Install' & I was up & running. \nAlternative approach I've heard to work was - remove ARD from Apps, launch App Store, check for the ARD app, which shows as to buy, quit App Store, put ARD back in Apps & check again.\nA third possibility - untested & definitely worth having a backup - see if com.apple.pkg.RemoteDesktopAdmin_AppStore either .bom or .plist exist in /private/var/db/receipts.

I recently bought a a pair of DDR3-1066 SODIMMs to upgrade a Mid-2010 MacBook Pro.\nOn the packaging for the memory, it says \"Compatible with MacBook Pro: Mid-2010, Early-2011, Late-2011\". However, according to Wikipedia, the 2011 models require DDR3-1333.\nWhat would happen if somebody bought this memory and installed it in a 2011 MacBook Pro?\nWould the memory run at 1333 speed (and if so, could this cause issues)? Or would the machine slow down to accommodate the slower RAM?\nEdit: The memory is Corsair CMSA8GX3M2A1066C7. A picture of the packaging is below.\nIs it really true that Corsair is recommending memory of the wrong speed?\n\n\nA: What will happen?  Either one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*It will work but the memory will run at a slower speed\n\n*Your MacBook Pro won't boot\n\n\nI personally don't use slower memory than what is recommended, but I have upgraded machines that had slower memory and those were working just fine when I did.  However, it's a pretty good bet that if Corsair says it's compatible, it will work.  \nIf the memory isn't compatible, you aren't going to harm anything.  Your computer won't boot and will more than likely give you a series of tones indicating your memory is bad.\n", "Q: Mono output from an external DAC Due to a health issue I have very reduced hearing in my left ear. Because of this I often listen to music in mono instead of stereo. The macOS audio controls (under the accessibility settings) allow me to select that the stereo output be converted into mono, however this doesn’t seem to work with the the DAC I am using the Schiit Fulla 2, which stubbornly continues to output in stereo. It works fine for the built in audio output. \nIs there a way to get a mono signal to my external DAC instead of stereo? I mostly need this for iTunes but would prefer it be system wide\nThanks in advance\nEDIT: I know This can be done with apps like Audio Hijack, but I was hoping to do this at the system level and not have to have an app running when I want to switch output to mono.\nAlso I tried my DAC in iOS and it work with the accessibility settings to switch the output to Mono so it looks like a limitation of macOS at this point.\n\nA: I'm going to end up sounding like a one-man advertising campaign for this app [I have no affiliation, it's just darned useful]\nRogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack can do this type of routing easily. It unfortunately cannot route 'everything' to any given output in a single move, but you can make it route multiple apps & System audio through the same signal path.\nYou build by dragging & dropping elements from the right side-bar into the main window.

Then you dial in your specifics by clicking at the bottom of each element & choosing its app, effect or device.\nEffects are - some built-in or any AU effect plugins on your Mac.\nIt is ostensibly an audio recorder, but if you don't put a recorder element in the path, then it will just pass-through instead.\nI built this in less than a minute to route system & 2 yet to be decided apps through a channel 'effect' set to mono, then out through my audio USB.\nCaveats:\nIt must be set running to function, so it's not a complete 'set & forget' at system level.\nIt's expensive for a one-trick pony.\nIt will auto-launch all apps used in a 'Session' so you might not want to put them all in one setup but make different combinations, as needed.\n\nSee Split Input Channels Using SoundFlower and AULab and Nice Audio Mixer/Repeater for some other routing examples I've built.\n", "Q: Without a backup, can I downgrade from Sierra to El Capitan?

I've since done a high security erase of the drive and all my issues seemed to go away. Disk Utility reported the drive was okay and I was able to reinstall OS X and restore from a TM backup, etc.\nHowever, a few 3rd party apps indicate my drive now has 21 reallocated bad sectors. I imagine this is better than the previously reported 20 bad sectors (now showing as 0), but these apps are indicating my drive is still failing solely due to that. \nI haven't been able to find much information on the web about lifetime of a drive after having reallocated bad sectors, so I'm unsure of what to do. Will these reallocated bad sectors become a problem, or are they indicative that the problems haven't stopped? Should I bite the bullet and just install a new SSD? \n\nA: This question could be considered 'opinion-based' however, in my opinion...\nNo hard drive is ever going to 'heal' over time; it can only degrade.\nIf it's developed bad blocks before, it will likely develop more as time goes on.\nUnless you have a Time Machine constantly connected & working, giving you an hourly safety-net, I'd bit the bullet & swap it out now. \nBetter safe than sorry.\nYou'll also love the speed the SSD gives you.

This Early 2015 12 inch MacBook was showing 75% battery remaining, and when I plug in my iPhone to try to record the iPhone, the Macbook began to sleep and refused to turn on when I press the power button.  It showed the \"Plug Me In\" icon.\nSo I unplugged the iPhone and started charging it, and then it would turn on right away, and showed a 69% battery level.\nSo why did it refuse to be on at such a high level of battery remaining and how can it be fixed or prevented?\nP.S. It is a Macbook 12 inch that was introduced in 2015... so the battery is just a little more than one year old.\n\nA: Assuming it is a 12\" MacBook (implying at most it's still a little shy of being a couple of years old) and not a 13\" model (which could be a lot older), then the first thing I'd do is reset the System Management Controller.\nFor a 12\" MacBook you reset the SMC as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer \n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in. \n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol \n(on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button \n\n*Let go \n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button. \n\n\nOnce you've done this report back on how it went.\nIf in fact it's not a 12\" MacBook, then please update your question with the exact model so we can make sure we're providing accurate advice for your model.\n\nA: If a battery driven device (a MacBook in this case) doesn't turn on without the AC adapter plugged in it means that the battery cannot supply enough current to power the device.\n\nThis first generation Macbook 12 inch was showing 75% battery remaining...\n\nThe \"75% battery remaining\" is a calculation based on how much charge the battery has verses it's full capacity and the electrical current it's capable of delivering at that moment. \nWhen the battery drops below a certain amount of voltage, the overcharge/undercharge protection circuit kicks in and kills power to the device.  What's happening with your battery is that it can no longer hold a charge.  Even though it has calculated 75% charge left, the voltage drops too low too quickly and the MacBook will turn off/go to sleep.\nBasically, your battery can no longer hold a charge and is going into hibernate/sleep mode.  This is expected behavior.\n\nThis being a 2015 MacBook, it's unusual for a battery to have such a short lifespan, though it's not unheard of.\nBatteries typically have a useful life of 3 to 5 years. So, less than 2 is concerning.  If your product is still under warranty, you should get the battery replaced by Apple; it's covered under AppleCare if that is still in effect.\nIf you don't have AppleCare, it can still be fixed relatively inexpensively.\nAccording to iFixit.com, the battery is glued into position and extremely difficult to remove.  It can be done, but like I said - it's extremely difficult.  Also, it's very difficult to source the part from reputable vendors.  \n\nHowever, the good news is that if you have the technical skill, you can replace the entire bottom case assembly (PN# 661-02245) for this unit as it includes the battery ($130USD at the time of this post).  Ifixit.com has a guide for you to follow or you can take it into an Apple Repair shop.\n", "Q: Apple Two Factor Authentication: why verification code popup don't display?

I am using another MacBook Pro under Yosemite while my Sierra machine is being repaired. However, I forgot to export Contacts before taking my Sierra machine in this morning and now my Contacts data is 3 years old, which is pretty well useless to me. It should be no problem, because all the necessary info is on my Time Machine linked to Sierra. However, things are not so simple (at least for me).\nHow can I now get my contacts info onto the Yosemite machine from the Sierra-based Time Machine backup? It seems that none of the published solutions works.\n\nA: Update: I have updated the script as per @user3439894’s feedback. The script should now work for most users, no matter what flavor their address book raw data is in.\n\nYou might want to look at a temporary command-line solution. It gives you a contact <search_term> command that you can run in Terminal.app to look up contacts.\nI assume your Yosemite MBP is only a temporary solution while your Sierra MBP is at the repair shop. While the Terminal command has limited functionality, it might work well enough for you to be useful while you wait for your Sierra MacBook Pro to return.\nSetting up the temporary command should require not more than 10–15 minutes.\nSetting up the contact command\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Time Machine backup that contains your (Sierra-based) address book data.\n\n*In your backup, look for the folder \"${HOME}/Library/Application Support/AddressBook\", which is the root folder for all your contact data.\n\n*Restore that entire AddressBook folder to a temporary location, e. g.: ${HOME}/SierraAddressBook.\n\n*Double check that the whole ${HOME}/SierraAddressBook tree has the correct permissions so you can read it without an administrator password.\n\n*For good measure, make a backup copy of your ${HOME}/.bash_profile file.\n\n*Open the file ${HOME}/.bash_profile in a text editor of your choice.\n\n*Temporarily append to .bash_profile the following lines: \n(Note that for some of these lines, indentation matters; try not to change indentation in any of those lines, even if it looks a bit off.)\ncontact() {\n  # We assume \"${HOME}/Library/Application Support/AddressBook\"\n  # has been restored to this directory from a TM backup.\n  local contacts_base_dir=\"${HOME}/SierraAddressBook\"\n\n  local search_term=\"$1\"\n  local sql_code=\"$(cat << EOF\n.mode column\n      SELECT\n        TRIM(       IFNULL(R.ZFIRSTNAME, '')\n          || ' ' || IFNULL(R.ZLASTNAME, '')\n          || ' ' || IFNULL(R.ZORGANIZATION, '')) NAME,\n        'created ' || date('2001-01-01', ZCREATIONDATE\n          || ' seconds', 'localtime') CREATED,\n        'modified ' || date('2001-01-01', ZMODIFICATIONDATE\n          || ' seconds', 'localtime') MODIFIED,\n        GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT TRIM(IFNULL(E.ZLABEL, ''),\n          '! _$<>') || ' ' || IFNULL(E.ZADDRESSNORMALIZED, ''))\n          EMAIL,\n        GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT TRIM(IFNULL(P.ZLABEL, ''),\n          '! _$<>') || ' ' || IFNULL(P.ZFULLNUMBER, ''))\n          PHONE\n      FROM\n        ZABCDRECORD R\n      LEFT JOIN\n        ZABCDEMAILADDRESS E ON E.ZOWNER = R.Z_PK,\n        ZABCDPHONENUMBER P ON P.ZOWNER = R.Z_PK\n      WHERE\n        NAME LIKE '%${search_term}%'\n      GROUP BY\n        R.Z_PK\n      ORDER BY\n        NAME;\nEOF\n    )\"\n\n  export sql_code\n  find \"${contacts_base_dir}\" -regex '.*/AddressBook-[^/]*\\.abcddb$' \\\n    -exec bash -c \"/usr/bin/sqlite3 '{}' <<< \\\"\\${sql_code}\\\"\" \\;\n}\n\nexport -f contact\n\n\n\n*Save your changes in .bash_profile.\n\n*Open Terminal.app.\n\n*Open a new terminal window.\nUsage\nRun the command contact followed by your search term in the Terminal.

I am not sure whether this is the right place to ask about hardware incident, but I am not sure where else to ask. If you know a better place, please kindly share with me.\n\nI failed to dismantle my macbook pro's battery. It's currently lying on the ground outside my house.\nHere's what happened:\nI bought a new battery for my Macbook Pro 15' Retina early 2013 and started to remove the old one today. I made several mistakes along the way:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had only experience with installing SSD, but was thoughtless to think it's the same.\n\n*I wasn't intellectually prepared. For example, it might be better to use up the battery before dismantling it. Mine was fully charged. \n\n*I used a metal chisel to pry up the battery from the base (it was glued tightly with the base) . I should've used plastic materials.\n\n\nThe battery looks like this:\n\nI successfully pried up the leftmost two batteries and the rightmost two batteries, leaving the two central pieces. When I began prying one of central ones(quite hard), an orange flame flashes! \nIn case it exploded, I dropped it outside of my house and put warning signs around it. I even called the fireman asking what to do, but he just told me to be cautious..??\nThe worst part is, the chisel is still stuck between the battery and the base! I tried to remove it, but instantly the flame showed up again.\nHere is what it looks like now:\n\n\nI am considering ask for some help from local computer repairment shops. But in case they are not able to help (since it's rather dangerous), should I give up fixing it or not?\nIf so, what is the safest way to dispose the battery, and the laptop?\n\nA: You punctured the Lithium Ion Battery. Basically, you created a small \"short\" somewhere between the electrodes inside the cell.\n\nA mild short will only cause elevated self-discharge and the heat\n  buildup is minimal because the discharging power is very low. If\n  enough microscopic metallic particles converge on one spot, a sizable\n  current begins to flow between the electrodes of the cell, and the\n  spot heats up and weakens. As a small water leak in a faulty hydro dam\n  can develop into a torrent and take a structure down, so too can heat\n  buildup damage the insulation layer in a cell and cause an electrical\n  short. The temperature can quickly reach 500C (932F), at which point\n  the cell catches fire or it explodes. This thermal runaway that occurs\n  is known as “venting with flame.” “Rapid disassembly” is the preferred\n  term by the battery industry. 1\n\nThere is an excellent video on YouTube that shows exactly what happens when you puncture one.\nSo, how do you dispose?\nAn electronics recycling center.  A simple Internet Search will bring up centers in your area.\nGiven your lack of experience and the high likelihood of a dangerous situation, your best bet is to let someone with skills in this sort of disassembly handle the procedure.\n\nam considering ask for some help from local computer repairment shops. But in case they are not able to help (since it's rather dangerous), should I give up fixing it or not?\n\nFix it?\nYou shorted out the contacts of the battery that connects it to the main board, used a chisel to pry off the adhesive from a paper thin aluminum housing and proceed to puncture the battery which caused a fire.  \nIf you can get the chisel out without setting it ablaze and your logic board is still functional, you still have the top case assembly to replace.

I have seen nothing online indicating that shouldn't work. iMac does not ask for any firmware/EFI updates so seem to be fully up to date in that regard. The WD drive is formatted with GUID and split into two volumes. But when the iMac starts with the new hard drive (cloned from the old with the newest version of Carbon Copy Cloner) internally mounted, there is just the blinking folder with question mark. If I then boot from a USB stick with the drive still inside, the iMac will say that it doesn't recognise the disk. If I open Disk Utility and select the WD disk, it will be listed as having a Master Boot Record partition scheme.\n\nIf I take it out, mount it in an external enclosure and connect to same iMac over USB, it works fine, and can even be booted from.\n\nAs can be seen, when used externally is is correctly listed with a GUID partition map.\nTo recap: Works fine externally, can be booted from over USB.

Start of first partition 4k aligned\n\nThe 4k GUID partition table looks like this in 4k blocks:\n               0     (0)      1  (4096)   PMBR\n               1  (4096)      1  (4096)   Pri GPT header\n               2  (8192)      4 (16384)   Pri GPT table\n               6 (24576)    ...           Start of first partition\n\nEither GPT table can hold up to 128 partition entries.\nThe GPT standard requires that the primary GPT header must be located at block 1.\nA 512B disk partitioned in a 4k-only enclosure won't have the primary GPT header starting at Byte 512 but at Byte 4096. The GPT of this disk attached internally won't be detected properly because the primary header is expected at Byte 512.\nOnly the PMBR seems to be valid and the \"Partition Map Scheme\" is therefore detected as \"Master Boot Record\". \nThe opposite is also true: the GPT of a 512B disk partitioned internally (with the primary header starting at Byte 512) won't be detected in the 4k-only enclosure because there the primary header is expected at Byte 4096.\n", "Q: How do I remove the iCloud symbol when trying to download an app?

When I depress the sustain pedal on my keyboard while recording or playing the piano sounds in GarageBand, the sound loses its \"brightness.\"  The attack seems to be diminished when the pedal is depressed.  Is there a way to remove that effect?\n\nA: Pianos in Garageband and Logic have separate samples for pedaled and non-pedaled keys, I do not think this is done by effect or anything like that. It simply reflects the sound of real piano when damper goes down.\nIn Logic you can edit the EXS24 instrument and replace the pedaled samples with non-pedaled ones if you want. That could work.\n", "Q: Editing/removing hostfile on jailed iPhone So guys I've done a very silly thing.

I am looking to use my existing WD harddrive but use thunderbolt 2 instead of the usb3 A connection. I have looked for cables but all I find is type c ones.\n\nA: Thunderbolt is a wholly different connection protocol from USB--it's more like external PCI-Express--so any such cable would need a USB controller built-in. It's almost certainly possible to miniaturize this into a single cable, but I doubt the demand ever existed for a commercial part to make sense; additionally, performance would still be limited by USB's capabilities. Your best bet is probably a Thunderbolt \"hub\", for instance this USB and eSATA model, or a larger dock such as this one.\n", "Q: How to get video from webcam in a \"Picture in Picture mode\" While recording a screencast with QuickTime, I want to get video from the webcam in small window overlay.

I am wondering if the biometric information collected by Apple's Health app stays local on my iPhone, or if it's being sent to Apple?\n\nA: Unless you choose to backup your data to iCloud, none of your data will be sent to Apple. Even if you do choose to backup your data to iCloud, that data is encrypted - meaning only you can access it.\nApple’s privacy policy is here and you can request Apple send you all the data they have and inspect the health data yourself to know how / when / what was collected based on how you set up your accounts and sync options combined with how iOS is programmed.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/ (Read about policies and related links)\n\n*http://privacy.apple.com/ (Sign in and get your data)\n\n\nHowever, you also decide what 3rd party apps, if any, you want to have access to your health data.

You decide which information is placed in Health and which apps can access your data through the Health app. When your phone is locked with a passcode or Touch ID, all of your health and fitness data in the Health app — other than what you’ve added to your Medical ID emergency card — is encrypted with your passcode. You can back up data stored in the Health app to iCloud, where it is encrypted while in transit and at rest. Apps that access HealthKit are required to have a privacy policy, so make sure you review these policies before providing apps with access to your health and fitness data.\n\nSource: Apple \nIn a nutshell, only you (or anyone who knows your passcode or has a fingerprint set on your iPhone) have control of your health data.\n\nA: Yes, if you ask it to, either by enabling backups of allowing it to share it with another app that does. Can Apple see the information? We don’t know. I came here to find out if we had an answer after reading that privacy policy in the health app. The text quoted from the policy doesn’t answer the question. The assertion by Apple that the information is encrypted while at rest at Apple doesn’t mean that Apple is saying it doesn’t have (or have access to) the keys to decrypt it.  In the case of messages content, as I recall, we do have Apple’s assurance that it is encrypted AND Apple doesn’t have a way to decrypt it other than on the user’s device.  \nSomeone should contact Apple’s privacy officer to get an answer. Here, perhaps. \nPS: The false claim that “data is encrypted” - means “only you can access it” is dangerous misinformation. \nSee, eg Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World\nBy Bruce Schneier , Chapter 13 on Key Escrow, AKA GAK, etc. \nSpecifically, it is well documented by Apple that it’s at least sometimes the case that even though on Apple devices, a user’s data is encrypted, Apple has access to it due to Key Escrow, that is, it is NOT the case that “only you can access it” see link in my comment on the other answer. \n", "Q: Seagate Hard Drive Not showing in Disk Utility I have a Mac OS X EI Capitan Version 10.11.6. Also got a 1.5Tb Seagate External hard drive. The hard drive is about a year old and my mac is only a few months old. The hard drive always work fine, but when I plug it in now, it doesn't mount at all and doesn't even show in Disk Utility? I thought of just re-formatting the hard drive. But I can't format it if it doesn't show in Disk Utility, it also doesn't show when I go to the Terminal. Type in diskutil list, it only shows my Mac hardrive. The hard drive is running, I even replaced the usb cord but still nothing. It doesn't even show up in my Time Michine. I added screenshots. Please can someone help me.\n\n\n\nA: Barring also testing it on another Mac, that sounds like a hard drive logic board failure. Your best bet might be to source a logic board from another identical hard drive, with an IDENTICAL board model identifier (including the revision if any), and swap for yours, then see if it works.\n", "Q: bash prinf goes to log but output= not The first line of this snipet goes to the logfile, but the second doesn't.\nI need the second be executed and loged. \n#!/bin/bash\nprintf '%s %s (%s) running...\\n' 2>&1 | tee -a $logfile\noutput=$(restic -r ${backupdir} snapshots ) 2>&1 | tee -a $logfile\n\nHow can i log the output= line as well?\n\nA: In the second line, there should be no output! You're assigning the result of restic -r ${backupdir} snapshots to output, and that won't produce any output, either to stdout or to stderr (it's equivalent to output=\"Value stored for later\" - when this command executes, there's no output).\nTry something like...\noutput=$(restic -r ${backupdir} snapshots )\necho $output | tee -a $logfile\n\nOr you could simplify it by just doing...\nrestic -r ${backupdir} snapshots 2>&1 | tee -a $logfile\n\n", "Q: App Store purchases and updates I've been having this problem for a few days. \nRecently I switched my App Store country region from India to Canada. All my past app purchases and downloads were erased. I then downloaded some apps that I had already downloaded through the Indian Store. These apps were not added to my purchases. I am unable to review them therefore. \nAlso, a popup for software update keeps showing up but when I check for updates I cannot see any updates.\nI'm using an iPhone SE.\n\nA: Usually users can switch their App Store region by logging out of their Apple ID for one region and then signing in with their Apple ID for the other region. All downloads will still remain on the iPhone and should not be erased. So why were your past purchases erased? Did you do this or did it just happen?\nWhen app updates appear, the only updates you can download are for apps you downloaded with the Apple ID you're currently signed into. So this means having to regularly sign in and out of your Apple IDs. \nThis is what I mean. If you downloaded app X from the Indian store and you are signed in to the Apple ID for the Canadian store, the App Store app will still tell you that an update is available for app X. But downloading that update won't work unless you sign out of the Canadian Apple ID and then sign back into the Indian Apple ID. That's why it is better to just delete app X and redownload it using the Canadian ID as that meas it will be listed as a purchase for that ID. But if app X cost money then you don't want to do this because you don't want to pay for it again.\nWhat you should do is delete any apps from the Indian store that are freebies and then download them again with your new Canadian Apple ID. This way you only have to change back to the old Indian Apple ID when you have to update an app that you paid for as you wouldn't want to have to pay for it again.\nDoes this answer your question?\n", "Q: Does wifi need to be on for AirDrop, even if using ethernet connection? My iMac is connected to my network with an ethernet cable - as such I have turned wifi off, to ensure that I am using the wired network, rather than the much slower wifi network.\nAirDrop never seems to work on that iMac, whereas I can AirDrop easily between my iOS devices and MacBook (which is on wifi).\nI have only just clicked that these two points may be related. For AirDrop to work do I need:\n\n\n*\n\n*All devices to be connected to the same wifi network?\n\n*Wifi to be switched on, but not connected, on the iMac?\n\n*Something else?\n\n\nIf I need wifi to be enabled on the iMac, can I \"forget\" my home wireless network without iCloud forgetting it on my other devices?\n\nA: Please turn on wifi on the iMac, but no need to connect to any network. Since you are connected via Ethernet your syncing iMac with iCloud will happen without any interruption. Now you will be able to use Airdrop and iCloud syncing simultaneously. Hopes this will help. \n", "Q: Making an installable ISO of Bootcamp drive I have the 2016 MBP and built up my Windows 10 installation just as I would like it. To speed up recovery and re-installation to it's current point I would like to backup the Bootcamp drive so that I can reinstall from that and not have to reinstall Windows and all the applications I have now configured.\nAs a first attempt at this I installed DataNumen Disk Image and MacDrive 10 Standard. I used this combination to create a .img backup of the Bootcamp drive, from within Windows, to an external HFS+ formatted drive, so that if Windows fails I can still access the .img file from macOS Sierra.\nAm I doing this correctly? Will I be able to reinstall from the .img file and short-circuit the painfully slow re-install process of Windows' apps? Is there a more appropriate method?\n\nA: I would never attempt to handle any aspect of Boot Camp partitioning or data structuring from inside Windows.\nWindows has no idea its partition is balanced precariously on a 'fake' MBR disk sitting inside a GUID partition. Too many people touch it & break it.\nInstead I would use something designed specifically for Boot Camp installations within the Mac environment. That way you're not tightrope-walking.\nAs far as I'm aware, Paragon Hard Disk Manager is the only app that can do the task in its entirety, handling Boot Camp & Mac partitions - move, backup/restore etc. \nTwoCanoe's WinClone can do the Boot Camp partition, but doesn't handle the Mac partitions.\nCarbon Copy Cloner is great for your Mac Partitions, but not Boot Camp. It requires you already have the specialised partitioning structure in place - see Bombich KB: Can CCC back up my BootCamp (Windows) partition?\nI own all three, but am not affiliated with any of the recommendations\n", "Q: MAMP nginx.conf - invalid number of arguments in \"user\" I am having issues starting up Nginx with the MAMP Pro application.\nWhen I press start Nginx I get the following error message\ninvalid number of arguments in \"user\" directive in /Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/conf/nginx.conf:7\n\nlooking at the configuration file \n\n/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/conf/nginx.conf\n\nI notice the following line has multiple users\nuser rob COMPANYWORKDOMAIN\\Domain Users;\n\nHowever changing it to just one user (rob) does not work because it gets overwritten and reverted back next time I start up Nginx via the MAMP application.\nI'm a  bit stuck as what to do here?\n\nA: Your host is part of the domain COMPANYWORKDOMAIN and user rob is a domain user (probably admin, network, managed) but no local admin user.\nnginx.conf line 7 is determined by the \"Run server as:\" settings in MAMP Pro and mustn't be edited manually:\n\nSince your user is no local admin account using rob will fail.\nSo either use the standard Unix users (www/www) or a local admin account (which requires to log out as rob and log in as another local admin user) to run MAMP Pro:\n\n\nA: I ran across this error, and the issue turned out to be that there were spaces in the group name. I fixed this by going to File -> Edit Template -> Nginx (nginx.conf) and putting double quotes around MAMP_Group_MAMP (should be around line 7, or you can just search for it).\n", "Q: Why am I getting a 31 character limit on file saves from Mail all of a sudden? \nIs this because I installed macOS Sierra from Yosemite a couple of months ago, it's on my B Mac so don't use it so much.\n\nA: From the screenshot I am assuming you're trying to save an attachment directly from Mail.\nIf so, there is a known issue that a corrupted Mail index causes this odd 31 character file size limit when saving from Apple Mail. The best way to correct this is to follow Apple's instructions for rebuilding your Spotlight index.\nIf my assumption is wrong (re the Mail app), let me know and I'll update my answer with broader solutions beyond just the Mail app issue.\n\nA: Per this Macworld article, you could try the following and see if they help.\n\n\n*\n\n*You’re trying to save out of Apple’s Mail app and it has a corrupted index. Many users across many forums and years report being told the character limit for a volume is 31 characters, then re-indexing Mail, and the problem disappears. Go figure! But if it works, it works. The simplest way to fix Mail is to re-do your whole Spotlight index per Apple’s instructions. (There are outdated instructions on Macworld and elsewhere for deleting Mail’s index by itself, but these seem unreliable in El Capitan.)\n\n*If you’re using a network or external volume that’s not formatted for Mac OS X (as HFS+), you may be hitting a limit for that other format.\n\n*Some software was never properly updated to move from a previous maximum 31-character limit many, many years ago—this dates back to Mac OS 9! But for compatibility’s sake, some software throttled filename length. Apparently, some apps still adhere to this.\n\n*Your full Unix path may be too long. There’s a soft limit of 1024 characters for the entire path from root to your file (like /Users/glenn/Documents/Hope Springs Eternal/Smashmouth/Ringbearer/Oodles.txt/). Some users report being able to create paths longer than that, but then experiencing problems.\nYou may need to repair your disk. The best way is to boot into OS X Recovery, run Disk Utility, and run Repair Disk on your startup volume. Restart your Mac, then hold down Command-R until you get the recovery screen. Launch Disk Utility, select the startup volume, and click Repair Disk; do the same for the partition in that volume. Then Restart.\n\n", "Q: Sharing music from CD's Me and my husband have just upgraded our phones. Since we have done this I now can no longer access all our music (on my phone). We have separate I-Tunes accounts and family share and for the last god knows how long I have always been able to listen to Albums he has burned from CD's on to our Mac on my phone but all of a sudden I don't have access to them all. Most I can access and download from the cloud but there are the odd tracks and all albums by Garth Brooks that I can not access. Does anyone have any idea what's going on. TIA\n\nA: Prior to various iCloud services, you used iTunes to sync music to your iphone. If you burned from CDs, the music will be in iTunes on your Mac. The simplest solution is to plug in your new iphone to the Mac and let iTunes sync. This will allow you to copy all music in iTunes Mac to the new iPhone. (this also allows you to backup your phone to the mac)\nSince iCloud you have the option of syncing your music library via iCloud. However, this is not a free service, you need to enable iCloud Music Library, and pay for the service.  You can get this via subscribing to Apple Music or paying for something called iTunes Match. Either of these services will allow you to stream all your music, or download to your phone from iCloud.\n", "Q: Soldered RAM in macbook air 2015 This question is just to fulfil my curiosity about how my mac works.\nI have a macbook air (2015) with 8GB of soldered RAM.\nAnd for what I know 2 RAM modules of 4GB are faster than 1 module of 8GB because they work in parallel and each has it's own bus, but as it is soldered there are no modules, so, are they more like 2x4GB, 1x8GB, 4x2GB, ...?\n\nA: From the images at iFixit.com, you can see that the RAM, soldered directly onto the MBA logic board (4GB of RAM in orange outline,) is not soldered onto a RAM carrier as you would find in a computer with removable RAM. I have no absolute proof, without diving into arcane documentation, but I'm sure Apple has designed the RAM to be interleaved if that is the technology they are using.\n\n", "Q: Split a column in Numbers by extracting text in parenthesis I need to extract everything from \"ORIGINAL COMBINED\" that is between parenthesis and place it in the SPLIT A and place the remainder in the SPLIT B column. For example:\n\n\nA: In order to accomplish this task, we need to use a combination of Text functions in our formulas. See Apple's documentaiton for more details on using these functions.\nTL;DR the formulas are beneath the explanation.\nSo we need to identify the (XX) in each text string.  In one column, display only the parens and numbers between them, and in the other column, omit them.  This will require combining several text functions into a single fomula.\n'Split A' Column\nIn the original 'string' each character has a position starting at 1.  So for example in the following string, the ( has a position of 3.\n1 (23) Large Broom\nSo what we need to determine is at what position is ( and ) in each string.  We can use Find() to do this.\nFIND(search-string, source-string, start-pos)\nSo using the example string above:\n=FIND(\"(\", \"1 (23) Large Broom\")\nreturns: 3\nThen we can use FIND() to get the positon of ) too.  In this case it returns the position of 6.\nWe can now use this with the MID() function to retreive the number with parens.\nMID(A2,FIND(\"(\",A2),FIND(\")\",A2,)\n// Where A2 contains our original text\nresult: (23)\nNow, if there are no () we will get an error so to handle this we wrap the whole formula in the IFERROR() function.  If there is an error return an empty string.  (or anything you wish)\nIFERROR(MID(A2,FIND(\"(\",A2),FIND(\")\",A2,),\"\")\nPaste this formula in your 'Split A' column.\n'Split B' Column\nWe can use the REPLACE() function to substitue an empty string for our number in parens.  So this: (23) becomes this: \"\". (The quotes won't show.)\nREPLACE(source-string, start-pos, replace-length, new-string)\nTo remove the (23), we need to add 1 to the position of ) then subtract the position of (.  So in this case 7 - 3 to get 4, the length of our number/parens string.\nREPLACE(A2,FIND(\"(\",A2,),(FIND(\")\",A2,)+1−FIND(\"(\",A2,)),\"\")Breakdown:\n\n\nREPLACE(\n  A2, ← the source string cell reference\n  FIND(\"(\",A2,),\n    (FIND(\")\",A2,)+1−FIND(\"(\",A2,)), ← resulting in 4\n\"\") ← replace with empty string\n\nWrap this also in a IFERROR() and now the result is 1  Large Broom  (Note the extra space.  This can be eliminated if we add 2 instead of 1)\nTL;DR - So here we are. Whew! the formulas with our nested functions to solve this:\nSplit A\nIFERROR(MID(A2,FIND(\"(\",A2),FIND(\")\",A2,),\"\")\nSplit B\nIFERROR(REPLACE(A2,FIND(\"(\",A2,),(FIND(\")\",A2,)+1−FIND(\"(\",A2,)),\"\"),\"\")\n\n\n", "Q: How to disable Better Touch Tool (BTT) inside a specific app? BTT should stop triggering actions whenever I am working in a specific app and BTT should automatically start triggering actions or listening to triggers whenever I move to a different app.\nGoogle search is not giving me any solution.\n\nA: Better than the accepted answer is to define \"Use Apple Default Or Do Nothing\" as the triggered action. This comes in handy if it is not possible to define the action, which will be the same as the input, for example with 3rd or 4th mouse button. And it is faster to define.\n\nA: Click on BTT's menu bar icon, and then select Disable BTT for Current App.\nTo disable specific global actions inside a specific app, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open BTT and make an action for what you want to prevent. For example, you have a global shortcut ⌘+F which perhaps opens Alfred, but you don't want it to happen in the Finder. In that case create a new BTT gesture in the Finder and set the trigger to ⌘+F.\n\n*Then set the action (which happens if you invoke this trigger) to simulate the shortcut ⌘+F. Essentially you are remapping the shortcut to itself, because per-app shortcuts take priority over global shortcuts.\n\nA: I cannot comment on the first reply because I need 50 reputation\nBe sure to click the little gear next to the trigger and check off \"Prevent recursive triggers\" otherwise remapping a key to itself will cause BTT to crash\n(remapping a key to itself for a selected application will swallow/prevent the global trigger)\n\nA: ensure you're using the latest version of BTT & follow the steps shown in the image.\n\n\n", "Q: How can I use less disk space on system storage? When I look at my storage chart about 100 GB is devoted to system storage. Is there any way to clear some space from the system folder and if so how?\n\nA: Are you on macOS Sierra?

Therefore I don't even know where this folder is or what i contains.\nI have OSX El Captain (10.11.6)\nHas anyone had the same issue or know what and where this folder is?\n\nA: It's likely your Local Time Machine Snapshots.\nIn Sierra, these are stored in /.MobileBackups/Computer, but it's not advisable to manipulate this folder directly. Either use the Time Machine application to delete individual snapshots, or disable local snapshots altogether by running the following Terminal command:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nI can't say why MacOS isn't cleaning them up after you've run an external Time Machine backup.

I have an slightly-aging iMac running the macOS Sierra (fully legal) and a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud that I keep around just for handling incoming files and punting them into my usual Linux based workflow. Often this means pulling something apart that came from a designer in Illustrator and exporting the pieces to for use in an open source publishing workflow.\nUnfortunately this computer has gone on the fritz and is giving me nothing but the Spinning Beach Ball of Death™. I've tried to no avail to figure out what ails it and am desperate to convert some AI stuff that came in to sane SVG's.\nIs it possible to run a full-legal version of macOS inside a virtual machine on Linux? Have lots of RAM and plenty of horsepower, I just don't know where to start. I remember playing with some pirated images in VirtualBox back in the day and they ran like a mule on drugs—and were more ornery. I need something to actually get a couple hours of work down without it taking all week.\nWhat's the best emulation system to use and what's the legal path to acquire a  machine image? Or is there another way to do this? Is there a cloud provider that I can VNC into and run my licensed software on? What tree should I be barking up?\n\nA: Well... if we assume that by 'legally' you mean according to Apple's EULA [there's a lot of bickering about that, so to avoid complication that's the definition I'll use.\nApple's EULA states, in short, that you can only run an Apple OS on Apple hardware; anything else is 'illegal'\nsee, I had to use that term, didn't I? ;-)\nSo, of course you could run it in a VM in Linux, but only if your Linux machine was actually a Mac [which would be rather pointless].\nThey only alternative I'm aware of would be to use a cloud instance & the only one of those I've really heard of [though never used] is MacinCloud\nIt was discussed on Stack Overflow a few years ago [2012] so that might be worth a look at.\n", "Q: MacBook shuts down with 60% battery My laptop shuts off with 50%-60% battery levels without saying anything - just dims the screen go off.

My mac mini is picking up both monitors however, with the option of mirroring displays etc. Whatever option I choose (mirror/second display) it still shows a blank screen.\nAny ideas why this is? Is it because of the VGA? Or the mix between VGA and DVI? If so what is a possible solution?\n\nA: Your Mac Mini has a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics card which uses either 128 or 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with your computer's main RAM.\nIf you're wanting to simultaneously use the Mini-DVI port and the Mini DisplayPort, then your Mac Mini needs to be set up as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Mini-DVI port to connect a DVI or VGA display at 1920x1200 pixels \n\n*Use the Mini DisplayPort (with an optional Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter) to connect a dual-link DVI display at 2560x1600 pixels \n\n\nIf you've got the right resolutions set and are using the correct cables, then you can try resetting the NVRAM to see if that resolves the issue.\nHere’s how to reset the NVRAM on your computer: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine.

Or is there another way I should do it?\n\nA: Apple has fixed Finder in macOS 10.13.4 to preserve hard links so my answer is to use Finder to migrate your TM backup. They did not, however, fix cp. It still does not preserve hard links and doesn't have an option to do so.\nI know the OP requested a way of doing it from the terminal but all my efforts to do so in macOS 10.13.3, where I had given up on Finder because it did not then preserve hard links, failed.\nThe rsync command suggested by @n1000 failed after more than 12 hours with out of memory, even though I have 16GB of memory.

I've found rsync very slow on other platforms too.\ncpio did not preserve ownership. \npax got strange errors.\nI came closest to success with tar:\ncd /Volumes/My\\ Passport\nsudo bash\ntar -cf - -T ~/TMFileList | (cd ../My\\ Canvio;tar -xpvSf -)\n\nwhere ~/TMFileList was created with\ncd /Volumes/My\\ Passport\nsudo bash\nfind -d Backups.backupdb -print > ~/TMFileList\n\n[I tried a tar -c | tar -x thing first but that was copying some hard links as separate files for reasons related, I guessed, to the order it was seeing the files. Which led to me making the depth-first list.]\nHowever tar was taking an impractically long time. I killed it after 3 days. Some of this was because it was extracting files multiple times. The majority of this was, like rsync, due to long periods of inactivity for reasons I could not determine. What it managed to complete had correct ownership and hard links were preserved.\nSo I strongly recommend using Finder. Just make sure you have macOS 10.13.4. Follow the Apple support instructions in the link at the end of @n1000's answer.\n\nA: As suggested to the answers and comments in this question, the -p option will not work on a Mac. I tested -rp and it will convert symbolic links to real files. That means when you use this your Time Machine backup will become significantly larger. Time Machine creates symbolic links for redundant files and therefore avoids copying duplicate files between the snapshots.\nHence, use\ncp -a\n\nto preserve the symbolic links. This will be necessary if you plan on continuing to use the data for Time Machine backups. Alternatively, you could also use rsync using the -K option to preserve symlinks, e.g.:\nrsync -ahvrK\n\nThis Apple support document describes the procedure for migrating a backup from one drive to another (using Finder).\n", "Q: Which keys are the symbols ⌃ and ⌥?

I recently had to wipe the MacBook Pro and reinstall macOS, apparently because of some SSD-related problems, and I loaded my data back onto it from the external hard drive's backup. \nAfter loading all of the data back onto the MacBook Pro, Time Machine backups were a bit messed up. My now-wiped/restored MacBook Pro was being recognized as a different machine than before it was wiped, so backups weren't merged with my history (it tried to back up my whole Mac from scratch instead of just the few gigabytes of new files). To remedy this, I merged the old backups with my new computer (had my new computer inherit the old backups), as described in this answer with:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/AdataHDD/Backups.backupdb/Owlswipe’s\\ MacBook\\ Pro\n\nThis remedied the issue on the hard drive and it proceeded to backup just the 11 GB of new data and associated the new backup with the old ones on the external hard drive, keeping all my history dating back to November.\nI did the same inheriting backups thing with the Time Capsule (after mounting its backups of my MacBook Pro onto my laptop) with:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/Time\\ Machine\\ Backups/Backups.backupdb/Owlswipe's\\ MacBook\\ Pro \n\nHowever, unlike on the hard drive, this did not solve the problem and did not merge the old backups with the new.\nProblem\nAfter inheriting the old backups onto my MacBook Pro, Time Machine begins to backup my Mac onto the Time Capsule and later, when I return to my Mac, shows this popup:\n\nUnfortunately, there's not enough room on the Time Capsule to do another complete backup of my computer without deleting my old backup history (which I need to retain) and so if I click \"Start New Backup\" the backup fails (runs out of space) or if I click \"Back Up Later\" my MacBook Pro doesn't backup at all.\nHow can I circumvent this odd protection to \"improve reliability\" and just backup my MacBook Pro to the Time Capsule, merging the backup with my new computer and only backing up the same 11 GB of new files that I had to back up to my external hard drive?\n\ntl;dr: How can I perform a Time Machine backup of my post-reinstall Mac to the Time Capsule without making a completely new backup, just like how I did with my wired external hard drive?\n\nA: Unfortunately, it's impossible to merge two sets of Time Capsule backups, as the Time Capsule itself runs checks to ensure that your backups are in \"good condition\".\nYou'll have to press Start New Backup, which deletes all of your old backups but will succeed in making a new one.\n", "Q: Quit terminal but store the session for next start When I restart Mac, I have the option of restart the applications which will quit.

More specifically, where should I point the probes in my multimeter on the motherboard ?\n\nA: Bring it to a repair shop. Poking a motherboard in general is extremely dangerous for the components. You may further break things in the process. \nIf you do accept this risk and wish to continue... It would seem to be pretty hard. Apple, being Apple, doesn't label anything on the board. Based on some motherboard pictures on eBay, you'd probably want to use the ground pin from one of the other peripheral connectors (which have good data sheets with pinouts) and hope that everything is on the same ground bus (which I think is true). If you know/suspect what caused the shortage, see if any of its pins beep the meter. There should be one (the ground pin). If any others do, that indicates a short (unless there are two+ ground connectors, like on Thunderbolt). \nTL;DR: You should probably have a repair shop check, and it's pretty hard to check it yourself.\n", "Q: Unable to resize last partition on external drive I have a 2 TB external USB drive partitioned into 3 \"drives.\" Two are ~500 MB, the third ~1 GB.

When I looked up epson it showed a microprocessing chip that's kinda pricey and only sold in japan I think and that is even weirder. Thank You\n\nA: It is an Epson device connected to your WiFi network, most likely a printer. However, it could also be a scanner, projector or even a pair of smart glasses.\nIf it's only new to your network, it could be that someone has plugged a USB stick (or similar) into a printer etc.\nI wouldn't be worried unless you don't actually own an Epson product. \n\nA: This is an Epson printer, copier or multi-functional device. The reason are may not have seen it before is because it isn't discovered automatically in all cases, as well as not always being discoverable like that in the first place.\nThe device has a memory card reader (often a SD card and CF card reader on the front, sometimes internally), or has the option to have one. In many cases, the software in the printer, copier or whatever device it happens to be has the ability to share the contents of the card, or, to store scans on the card and expose them over the network. Even when you don't explicitly enable or use this type of functionality, the systems in the device to make it work are quite often online anyway.\nThere is a second device in your sidebar, which is the same printer/copier/MFD but discovered using a different system. The one with the little computer display icon is a 'Bonjour' discovered device, while the one with the blue screen old-style icon is a NetBIOS, Workgroup or SLP discovered device. Bonjour is the 'newer' style and often used in Macs, the other one is older and used with Windows-based computers. Both of the icons point to the same device and most likely have the same features. Sometimes the Windows icon is used for files, card readers and scans, while the other one has no file functions but is used by macOS to automatically discover the printer when you first set it up. \nLong story short: no worries, all is well, even if you didn't plug it in, it's okay to have those icons there, and they don't really do anything.\n\nA: I assume this is happening at your home, according to the website you are visiting :-)\nThere is some Epson device connected to your network, and apparently made available to everyone on your network. If one of your family bought an Epson device and connected it to the network, that would explain it. Nobody is hacking into your computer. Someone made a device available to you, that is all. \nHowever, if it's not one of your family, then the question is how this device is getting on your network. Your network should be protected by a password, so your neighbours for example shouldn't be able to connect to it. It could be that you are not using a WiFi password, that your neighbours are using your WiFi network possibly without even knowing, and they bought a new device that is now showing up on your network. That is also not hacking; that is having an open network that anyone can access. \nPS. \"Seiko Epson Corporation, or simply Epson, is a Japanese electronics company and one of the world's largest manufacturers of computer printers, and information and imaging related equipment. \"\n", "Q: Delete the current line in Android Studio?

Entered in Spotlight as 7!/3! it will give you a proper result: 840.\nC(8,5)=8!/5!(8-5)!=8!/5!3!.

I have used Accessibility Inspector to get some properties of the Song Info window and the Open dialog and the only differences I have noticed is the name as well as the type. Song Info is a \"window\" while Open is a \"dialog\". Hence, I also tried these two variations on the previous code:\nrepeat until (exists dialog \"Open\")\nrepeat until (exists window dialog \"Open\")\nrepeat until (exists dialog window \"Open\")\n\nbut none of them compile.\nHow do I detect the Open dialog?\n\nA: The reason you're getting \"Syntax Error Expected end of line but found “\"”.\" when using repeat until window \"Print\" of process \"Evernote\" exists is because you're using it out of context of the calling application. You might say meaning, within the context of the calling application, it doesn't understand the command and the AppleScript Editor is not that well written to express what the error really means.\nAnyway, the example code below when run in ScriptEditor, by itself, will wait to display the \"Your wait is over!\" dialog box until iTunes is open and you press ⌘O or click File > Add to Library… on the iTunes menu.\ntell current application\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        repeat until (exists window \"Add To Library\" of application process \"iTunes\")\n            delay 1\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n    activate\n    display dialog \"Your wait is over!\"\nend tell\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the use of the delay command within the repeat loop. Obviously the value can be set to something else, even fractions of a second, however you should alway use a delay to avoid System Events from needlessly triggering the loop hundreds of time a second until the condition is meet.\n\n\nAs a general rule I've found that anytime I'm using code that has ... process ... or ... application process ... it's a call being made to or by System Events and as such in this use case, the repeat loop has to be within a tell statement or block of System Events in order to not get the error mentioned in your OP.\n", "Q: Multiple Macs freezing for several seconds I’ve posted here in the past when I had an issue that I couldn’t Google my way out of, hoping some kind soul can point me in the right direction once again. Please forgive the long read, but this is going to take some time to explain…I’ll try to condense as much as possible while still giving as much relevant information as I can.\nI do IT for a small Architectural firm - they have nine Macs (various mix of laptops and iMac’s, none older than 2012 and all fully updated to 10.12.3) and one Mac Mini used as a file server. Three users are running AutoCAD 2016 natively, four are running Revit 2016 in Windows via Parallels 12 (since AutoDesk does not make a Mac version of Revit). There is also one Windows 8 box running ArchiOffice server. All computers are on a wired connection, hooked into a 24 port Netgear switch via a wall patch panel and are connected to a Wi-Fi network as well. \nSeveral months ago (I can’t give an exact time because the users waited almost two months to report the issue to me, but let’s say in-or-around October) everyone began to experience random freezing. The freeze happens for a matter of seconds - sometimes as little as two seconds, sometimes as much as ten but generally no longer than that. If the user was in MacOS, they’d get the beach ball (the seconds would still tick by on the Finder clock for what that’s worth) but have full mouse control. If they were in Windows via Parallels, they’d have mouse control but otherwise frozen. This happens completely at random - some days it will only happen four or five times in an entire day, some days it will happen a dozen times in an hour. Now here’s the kicker - also completely at random, three or four of the computers will freeze at the exact same time. Never the same computers, never the same number, never the same time - but at random intervals, more than one Mac would freeze simultaneously. \nNow here’s the next wrinkle - I have one user that has never experienced a single freeze. She is the only one using the 2016 MacBook Pro. \nOk, so troubleshooting steps….when it became clear more than one Mac would freeze at a time, I just assumed the issue was coming from either the server or the network itself since everyone had those two things in common. I had one user work from an AutoCAD file on their desktop and disconnect from the server, but she still experienced the freezing. I felt like I could rule out the server at that point and turned my attention to the network. \nA list of things I’ve tried, in no particular order…I’ve turned off the Wi-Fi just so they’d all be using ethernet, I’ve turned off the ethernet switch and had them use Wi-Fi only. I’ve replaced the switch, replaced the ISP’s router, replaced the Wi-Fi router, replaced every Cat 5 cable in the building. Nothing helped and the freezing continues. The only hardware I haven’t replaced is the actual Cat 5 cable coming from the ISP outside the building since I can’t get to it.\nI spent a morning running Wireshark to see if that could tell me anything - it did seem to pick up on TCP retransmission errors when the freezing would occur, but it also picked up those same errors when there was no freezing so I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it or not. I could live with the explanation that something on the network is freaking out the Macs randomly and that I need to find a Network guru or work with the ISP to figure out the problem…if it weren’t for the 2016 MacBook Pro that has never had a single freeze.\nIn thinking about what’s different about this machine software-wise, all I can really point to is that it came with Sierra out of the box, whereas all the other Macs are older and have been moved from Mavericks or Yosemite to El Cap to Sierra. I’m assuming whatever iOS install that is running the Touch Bar isn’t somehow protecting it from outside network issues. The timing of this also does seem to indicate that it began around the same time that I started moving users to Sierra.\nSo that’s the very-long and short of it. I’ve Googled this ad nauseam, but can’t find anything quite like it.  My next step was to wipe out one of the affected Macs and do a clean install of Sierra, but before I go for the nuclear option that my gut tells me won’t change anything I thought I’d see if anyone kind enough to have gotten through this rambling diatribe might have any thoughts or suggestions. Thank you in advance!\n\nA: perhaps unrelated, but did your client's Macs happen to be upgraded to Sierra around the same time the random freezes began? \nmy iMac experienced random Finder freezes after upgrading to Sierra. the cause turned out to be Sierra's new iCloud storage feature; your Desktop and Documents folders automatically get moved to the cloud after the Sierra upgrade. that's when the freezing problems started for me. Finder would momentarily freeze every so often (spinning wheel) as it 'synced' the local Desktop & Documents folders with those stored in iCloud. it's a feature i don't need, so i disabled it in iCloud Preferences, and the random Finder freezes stopped. \n\nA: Was able to capture the system log via the Console app a few seconds after a freeze - as you can see from the numerous iCloud messages, it was immediately clear as to the culprit. All of the Macs in the office that were freezing were logged into the same iCloud account, and as soon as I saw this I looked at the 2016 MacBook Pro that never froze and sure enough - wasn't logged into iCloud at all. Logged out the affected users, and the freezing has stopped. No idea what caused the issue or what exactly its problem was, but for now I'm more than happy to have the workaround. Thanks to user2707001 for putting me on the right track!\n\n", "Q: Where is the tilde on French and US keyboard layouts? I have configured my keyboard for French and US layouts. I cannot find a tilde anywhere on there. \nNormally, the tilde (~) is on the upper case of the key to the left of the \"1\" character.\nIt is pretty essential if you use the terminal a lot, as it allows you to go to directly somebody else's home directory. cd ~suzanne takes you to suzanne's home. Since, as a Linux user, I make a lot of use of the terminal, I really need the tilde.\n\nA: Choose the keyboard viewer from the input menu on the menu bar.

This software has been around for a long time now and generally works very well.\nUsing this software you can browse the contents of your iPhone, including photos and videos stored within the iOS Photos app. Below is a screenshot of the options I get when I've selected an album or folder within the Photos app and clicked on the Export > button:\n\nNote: Just to be clear, the above screenshot is taken from a Mac with iExplorer installed. I am browsing the iPhone from within iExplorer on the Mac, selecting an album, and clicking on the Export > button.\niExplorer also allows you to mount albums/photos as a disk within Finder on the Mac so you can drag and drop files from the iPhone to your Mac. Once copied across you can then deal wth them like any other files on your Mac (e.g. you could import them into the Photos app on your Mac).\nBelow is a screenshot showing right-clicking on the Recorded Videos folder and selecting the Mount as Disk option.\n\nNote: Just to be clear, the above screenshot is taken from within iExplorer on the Mac. I have selected the Recorded Videos folder and mounted it as a disk on the Mac.\nI strongly suggest you check out the iExplorer page because it does a whole lot more than just transfer photos. You can also try it our for free and, if I recall correctly, can transfer a limited number of items.\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated in any way with Microplant or the iExplorer software.\nFinally, there are other software packages that claim to be able to do similar things to iExplorer. However I have never personally used them so cannot attest to how good they are, but you may want to try these out:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMazing\n\n*Phoneview\n", "Q: Write a function in zshrc that can take a parameter and can handle flags I usually need a chrome page opened to localhost:3000 when I am developing. So, I just run the following cmd:\n/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --app=http://localhost:3000\nSince I use this frequently and sometimes my port changes. I want to write a function in zsh where ch will open chrome in localhost:3000 while ch 2500 will open chrome in localhost:2500.\nSo far, this is what I have managed to do:\nch () {\n    command \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\"\n}\n\nThis opens a new chrome window but displays an error/warning in the console: /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/AppleGVA/AppleGVA-9.1.12/Sources/Slices/Driver/AVD_loader.cpp: failed to get a service for display 3\nBut when I add a flag:\nch () {\n    command \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome --app=http://localhost:3000\"\n}\n\nNothing happens and I end up getting an error:\nch:1: no such file or directory: /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome --app=http://localhost:3000\n\nA: The reason it does not work with the added flag is that you added the flag within the double quotes, essentially telling zsh that it is part of the command name. The only reason any quotes are needed is that the path to and name of Google Chrome contain whitespaces. Whitespaces are used by zsh (and any other Unix shell) as separator between words. Quoting a string tells zsh that it should be interpreted as a single word, no matter how many whitespaces (or other syntactic elements) are in it.\nOne way to do this correctly is:\nch () {\n    \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\" --app=http://localhost:${1:-3000}\n}\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Here only the path to Google Chrome is quoted, while the flag is separate. \n\n*The keyword command is not necessary. It would only tell zsh to use an external command instead of a function or alias of the same name, which is most likely not a risk here (The alias or function would have to be named \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\")\n\n*${1:-3000} is substituted with the first parameter ($1) passed to ch. If it is undefined or has a null-value (e.g. \"\") \"3000\" will be substituted instead. So running\nch 2500\n\nwill open Chrome on http://localhost:2500, but running\nch\n\nwill open Chrome on http://localhost:3000.\n", "Q: I want to disable iphone screen activation when plugging in a charger I want to use a low power, ultra light weight solar charger for a three week backpacking trip. But I have heard that any shadows will lower the output causing the phone repeatedly start/stop charging.

Can I stop the iPhone from waking up the screen when its battery begins to charge? iPhone 5, iOS 9.3.5.\n\nA: There is no native way to achieve this. Here are some alternatives:\n1. Low-light mode. Go to Settings - General - Accessibility - Zoom - Zoom Filter - Low Light. Enable zoom, double-tap the screen with three fingers, and you now have extra low light mode.\n2.

I would like to be able to download them as and when I want. I would also like my files to be backed up automatically like it does by default. \n\nA: iCloud Drive is not designed to do what you're looking for.  iCloud is a syncing solution and not a backup solution.  It's designed to provide you with access to all your files from all your devices, keeping them all in sync.  It doesn't allow selective file downloads (specifically for what you need).\nThe only option you have (apart from storing the largest files on a different cloud-enabled provider, like Dropbox), is turn on Optimize Mac Storage from System Preferences -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive -> Options.  You didn't mention the OS you have so I'm assuming it's Sierra.\nSee this Apple Support page for other ways of turning on optimized storage using iCloud Drive.  From that page:\n\nOptimized Storage in macOS Sierra can save space by storing your content in the cloud and making it available on demand. When storage space is needed, files, photos, movies, email attachments, and other files that you seldom use are stored in the cloud automatically. Each file stays right where you last saved it, and downloads when you open it. Files that you’ve used recently remain on your Mac, along with optimized versions of your photos.\n\n", "Q: Terminal command that is the same as copy paste in Finder? I'm curious. As far as cp and rsync I see all these different options. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you copy + paste in Finder, lets say from one hard drive to another, it should preserve:\n\n\n*\n\n*All file attributes (access time, modified time etc.)\n\n*All Symbolic Links\n\n*Recurse through the directory structure\n\n*(Can't think of anything else to preserve)?\nSo in the end, when you copy paste in Finder, everything will be an exact copy, just located in a different parent directory.\nWhat I'm looking for is a command that mimics exactly what Finder does when you copy + paste. That will answer this question...\nIf it turns out Finder doesn't do what I think it does please explain, and show the command line equivalents for what Finder actually does... it must be calling a command when you use the GUI - right?\n\nA: If you want to preserve file attributes, symbolic links, and recursive structure, rsync should suffice:\nrsync -a ~/somefolder /Volumes/SomeUSB/\n\nThe -a (archive) flag is a shortcut for the following rsync options:\n\n--recursive recurse into directories\n--links copy symlinks as symlinks\n--perms preserve permissions\n--times preserve times\n--group sets the group of the destination file to be the same as the source file\n--owner sets the owner of the destination file to be the same as the source file (if you're copying to a remote system, the remote SSH user will need to have superuser status for this)\n--devices rsync will transfer character and block device files to the remote system.\n\n", "Q: Dropdown menu navigation by the keyboard After getting to the menu bar (which in OS/X is already a hassle) we can use the first letter to access the submenu - ‘w’ for ‘Window’ in the screenshot below:\nSubsequently the ‘b’ was typed to access the ‘Background’ sub-submenu The question here is: how to expand it - without resorting to the arrow keys that are a big jump for the fingers and get them out of home row position?\n\nWhat I tried: tab space enter. None of those work. Only right arrow: but once again that is inefficient - almost as costly as using the mouse.  Is there any way to do this quickly i.e. with hands remaining on or near home row?\n\nA: Space or Enter both open a highlighted submenu where the current option does not have an action by itself. Right Arrow works when the current option does have an action, but you wish to open the submenu (I'm not aware of a single instance of such a case where it's not a bug).\nThis works regardless of whether you use ⌃F2 or clicking to open a menu. I am using macOS Sierra, but am not aware of this functionality missing from prior versions of macOS.\nJetBrains apps such as PyCharm have an unfortunate bug where their submenus aren't just submenus since you can select the top level menu item too (try clicking on the highlighted item in your screenshot). Space prefers to select where possible, which won't expand the submenu. This is a specific bug with such apps.\n", "Q: No low battery warning & random restarts Since I upgraded to macOS Sierra on my MacBook 15\" (Mid 2014), I noticed some weird behaviour:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I'm running low on power, it doesn't notify me that my battery is going to die.

Below are the steps for doing so, as well as the order you should do it.\n1. Reset the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset it on your particular Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys.

How does it recognize the device I'm using?\nIs there any way to watch this live stream without using flash?\n\nA: I assume you have Google Chrome installed? Open the link in Google Chrome and click \"enable flash.\" A \"pop up blocked\" message will appear at the right of the search box. Click on it and enable the website to use Shockwave Flash.\nYou do not need to have installed Adobe Flash using the Adobe Flash installer on your Mac for this to work.\n\nA: Open Safari Preferences, go to the 'Advanced' tab. At the bottom of that, enable the 'Develop' menu.\nThis will add another menu to the Safari menus, called, you guessed it, 'Develop'. In newer versions of Safari, this menu contains an entry 'Enter Responsive Design Mode' which opens up any web page as if you are browsing from an Apple mobile device; User Agent, Screen size and all. That should get you what you are after.\n\nA: \nHow does it recognize the device I'm using?\n\nThere are several ways for websites to determine which browser and kind of device you are using. Modifying your \"User Agent\" profile won't necessarily bypass them. See this related question from security.stackexchange. You can use the \"What Is My User Agent\" website to determine what you are sending out.\nWith Safari, try killing the process Safari Web Content (from Activity Monitor). Also, try clearing your cookie cache - including \"supercookies\".\nThe cbsnews live stream video plays on my iPhone 4S running iOS 9.3.5 so after clearing your cache and killing Safari Web Server, you could try a User Agent profile like:  \nMozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 9_3_5 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/601.1.46 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0 Mobile/13G36 Safari/601.1\n\n...this User Agent profile was obtained from my iPhone using the \"what's my user agent\" website.\nAlso from this How-To site you could try these or similar \"User Agent\" profiles:\n\nWhat is a User Agent Anyway?\n  When Safari visits a website, it will send a string of text such as this:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_2) AppleWebKit/600.3.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0.3 Safari/600.3.18\n\n\nThis tells the web server that this particular user is running Safari 8 on a Mac running OS X 10.10.2.\nIt will obviously be different per the operating system and web browser. > A computer running Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 10 would appear as such:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/6.0)\n\nbut I think it is best to test a known, working user agent profile on your system.\n", "Q: Identifying an accounts username upon login I am trying to run a launch agent upon a user logging in, but the script encapsulated by it requires knowing who is logging in.

The owner of /dev/console is root upon a user's login or more precisely when the launch agent runs as it changes to the user afterwards. Is there anywhere I can find out the username of a person logging in for the purposes of a launch agent?\n\nA: CurrentUser=\"$(env | grep LOGNAME | awk -F = '{print $2}')\" and $USER used in a script launched by a launch agent in /Library/LaunchAgents both contain the username of the user logging in. \nCurrentUser=\"$(users)\" contains all users.

I tried to gift her an iTunes song, paid for it. She got the email but could not access the song.\nHow can I send her iTunes music when she is residing in Vietnam? Any suggestions?\n\nA: There is a Vietnamese iTunes Store that your friend (or you) can use directly. The only way for you to gift her a song is under one of the following scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*You set up an Apple ID on the Vietnamese store and use that ID to gift her the song\n\n*Your friend sets up an Apple ID on the US store and you gift her the song to that ID\n\n\nBoth of the above are possible, but only you and she can decide whether it's worth the effort (while it's not hard to do, it's not exactly convenient). There is also the possibility that what you wanted to gift her is not available on the Vietnamese store.\nMy recommendation would be to contact Apple directly, probably best via this form, and explain what you wanted to do and ask them for advice about it. It may take them a couple of days to respond, but they will usually come up with a resolution (whether it is a credit on your account or some way of your friend being able to access it).\n", "Q: How to add a AppleScript file to the Finder toolbar to execute the AppleScript?

I'd like to mirror the music tracks/files and all the playlists from one iPod Nano 5th Gen 16GB\nto another another (Nano 5th Gen 16GB). Is there a way to easily automate this process?\nDetails\nMy iTunes music library is much larger than the 16GB iPod, and I have hundreds of playlists. The selection of playlists/artists/songs to reduce down to fit on the 16GB iPod is rather tedious, even when playing automation tricks (like creating a smart playlist containing all the songs that I've played in the last year, or whatever).\nI don't want to perform this tedious playlist-selection process every time I copy to another iPod.\nPotential solutions (?) I'm investigating include the following. 3rd-party MacOS applications that claim to facilitate this (TunesGo, iFunbox). Maybe I can use iTunes somehow to copy from iPod to a temporary iTunes (MacOS laptop) Music folder/directory, and sync said folder to a blank iPod? Something else? I've tried rsync-ing (on MacOS) the entire filesystems from a source and a target iPod, with no success (caveat: I may not have executed the initial rsync correctly; I'm retrying that now).\nRegardless, I'm here asking to see what processes have 1) worked well for other users (via empirical experience, not just speculative assertions), and 2) is easy -- ie, I want to minimize the number of steps in the procedure.\nAuthorization isn't an issue here - I own all the music and the iPods. I have several open \"authorization slots\" on my iTunes Store account (or whatever). And money isn't the issue here, so if I have to pay more to copy between the iPods, that's ok (within reason).\nfyi, I really love the iPod Nano 5th Gen's... except that they're small. I don't want to go to a larger/newer iPod because I like the Nano-5th-Gen's so much.\n\nA: Assuming I understand your question correctly, would a backup > restore process do what you want? \nMore specifically, have you tried doing a full backup to iTunes of the first iPod and then restoring that to the other iPod? Basically, when you connect the second iPod to iTunes you can do a Restore from the full backup you just created from the first iPod. \nOnce you've done the restore, the music may not be on your second iPod to start with, but then syncing it with iTunes should restore all the music/playlists you had previously downloaded to the first iPod.\nNOTE: I'm also assuming that all the music, playlists, etc are stored in your iTunes library on your Mac.\n", "Q: How to get a specific dictionary to be used to show a word entry in the inital dictionary view that arises from Spotlight? When I type a word into Spotlight (macOS Sierra 10.12.3) and I click on the dictionary (definition), it always comes up using the German dictionary. I have a German-bought Mac but work almost exclusively in English, so this is quite frustrating.\nI have tried moving the English dictionaries to the the top of the list in Dictionary preferences, and also tried deselecting the German dictionaries altogether, with no changes.\n\nA: Great question and it's one that comes up more often than not.\nHere is a link to a similar question submitted to AskDifferent a few years ago: How to switch language of OS X dictionary?\nYou could also try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Dictionary app and navigate to Dictionary/Preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n*In Preferences select or de-select the languages you prefer.\n\n\n\n\n\n*It may be that 'German' is still set as the preferred language, so de-selecting it may then allow you to remove it as you were initially attempting to do.\n\n\nAlso, after making these changes, try restarting your Mac. Sometimes this helps things reboot in proper order and get rid of processes and other 'crud' that may be clogging the Mac's Memory.\n'Hope this helps!\n~\n", "Q: Could files downloaded from Youtube and Tumblr harm Mac? I'm putting old files to fresh Mac and on one external drive, there is bunch of video files I downloaded from Youtube and Tumblr at one point few months ago.\nWould it be safe to put them to fresh Mac or could those files be harmful? There didn't seem to be anything bad with them before, but as this is fresh Mac I'm more careful now.\nShould I keep them away from fresh Mac just in case?\n\nA: Well there are two points to this. \nA.) there is a question of whether or not the files themselves contain any malicious code, which is hypothetically possible, but not likely. Owlswipe's comment is not correct in saying you cannot download files from YouTube, you can do so both through YouTube Red, as well as downloader extensions (which by the way are not illegal). \nAll a YouTube downloader extension does is use a program (often times wget, or something similar) to make a copy of the video file that is referenced in the html for that video's page. While it is possible for a downloader extension to infect that video file, it is quite unlikely for it to happen in practice. As far as files from Tumblr go you can probably safely assume the majority of posters on Tumblr do not have the knowledge how, or a reason to inject malware into a picture they are posting. Also seeing as both of these sites use HTTPS (Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol) it would not be possible for someone else to slip malware into either the file as you were downloading it or the page when you were connecting. Though there is always technically the possibility that their severs could be hijacked, it is very unlikely that it happened during the specific time you were downloading files. Which brings me to the second point.\nB.) Macs run macOS, which is built on Unix. Unix is very secure, and generally hard to infect with malware. While this does not mean you should stop caring about keeping your computer safe (because it is still possible for a Mac to get infected), as long as you don't enter your password into random prompts saying a program you didn't launch wants to modify your system you should be fine. Typically it is only Windows that is vulnerable to the type of attacks used by malware that is contained in an image or video file, and it is because of the way Windows handles both security access and multimedia with a connected system.\nAll in all your Mac should be fine if you move your older files to it. Unless you know for sure that someone had hijacked the YouTube or Tumblr servers on the day you downloaded the files, you don't realistically need to worry about it getting infected by them. With that said always be careful when running programs you download from the internet, even on a Mac, as it is easier for malware in a program to infect any system than it is for malware in a video or image file.\n", "Q: Notes data from external drive I recently replaced the HDD in my mid-2012 MacBook Pro with an SSD. After doing a clean install of OS X Sierra, I wanted to get my old notes from the backup copy of my old HDD.

I'm not fussed about preserving the original structure of the notes. \nPlease someone help me! those notes are really important to me!\n\nA: You should be able to recover your notes data from a Time Machine backup as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter Time Machine from the Time Machine menu\n\n*Use the timeline (it's on the edge of the screen) to locate a version of the Notes storage folder from before your clean installation of macOS Sierra. (The location should be ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/ where the '~' indicates your user account home folder)\n\n*Select the folder and click on Restore to restore it\n\n\nIf you haven't got a TM backup or want to try recovering the data from your HDD, see below.\nExtracting notes data from your HDD\nIf you haven't got a TM backup or can't get it to restore from one, you can manually extract the data using a web browser (e.g. Safari, Etc).\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the location on your HDD that is equivalent to the following path: ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/\n\n\n*Inside this folder you'll see files with names such as NotesV6.storedata\n\n*Copy these files to another location on your SSD\n\n*Add a .html extension to each of them. (Note: You will be prompted as to whether you're sure you want to use the .html extension - click on the Use .html button).\n\n*Use Safari or another web browser to open the NotesV6.storedata.html file first (it may not be 'V6' in your case, but it will be 'V' followed by a number)\n\n*You should now see your missing notes\n\n*Now go through the process of copying and pasting the data into new notes and saving them\nIf any of your notes are missing after going through the above steps, repeat Step 5 and open the other files you copied across at step 3 to see if your missing notes are there.\nLet me know if you run into problems.\n\nA: In case if anyone is not able to find notes in the files mentioned @  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/, Please check @ ~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite. Adding .html extension may not work, Instead you have to open this file in sqlite browser to get the data. ZICNOTEDATA table will contain all the data. You can write normal SQL query to get the data\n\nA: For anyone still looking for solution here is steps. These steps worked for me. I upgraded HDD to SSD\n\n*\n\n*Connect external drive to laptop\n\n\n*In finder go to external drive(from where you want to restore) in my case it was - /Volumes/{{Drive}}/Users/{{User}}/Library - If you do not see Library folder try to show hidden file and folders(cmd+shift+.)\n\n\n*In another finder open library path(/Volumes/{{Drive}}/Users/{{User}}/Library) but this time laptop disk not external.\n\n\n*Copy these files from external drive to laptop\nContainers/com.apple.Notes\nContainers/com.apple.Notes.datastore\nContainers/com.apple.Notes.HTMLConverter\nContainers/com.apple.Notes.Notesimporter\ninto laptop drive in same same path /Volumes/{{Drive}}/Users/{{User}}/Library\n\n\n*Now copy from Group Container\nGroup Containers/group.com.apple.notes\nGroup Containers/group.com.apple.notes.import\nOpen Notes app you will be able to see Notes exactly same as old disk.\n", "Q: Certification in iOS development I have an experience like of around 6 years as an iOS developer but I am feeling like stuck. Is there any certification for iOS developer which can help me in getting better job or which can put me in the priority list of recruiters?\n\nA: Getting certification for completing coursework and getting hired aren't necessarily at all related endeavors. If you have been developing for some time, then ideally you have something to show on your resume and CV which will reflect not only your relevance in the marketplace, but also your potential value to the company you are applying to and hopefully interviewing with. For example, your projects on github and other verifiable accomplishments clearly demonstrating your skill set.\nAs for certifications with recognized market value, I suppose a good start would be Apple's website portal: http://training.apple.com. Specifically for iOS development certification, there's Apple's \"Global Authorized Training Provider\" Learn Quest.  \nIt certainly couldn't hurt to learn the programming language Swift. I don't know that they have a certificate optionStanford offers a course through iTunes for iOS10. There's also the main Swift site and Apple's Swift Developer site.\n...and there's online course certificates from places like Udacity: https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003 \nNote that Udacity's \"nanodegree\" program and other certification programs (including bootcamps) claim varying degrees of \"money-back\" and other such guarantees if the certification doesn't lead to some kind of employment (which might simply be teaching the courses). The folks I know personally that have gotten hired to full-time jobs have paid for bootcamps and gotten jobs through the contacts they've made there.\nAs for getting noticed by recruiters, there is LinkedIn.com and job sites like Indeed.com. Networking, however, cannot be under-rated. Find local developer groups and meetings and get to know who the people in your area are. If you've gone to college, community schools, etc. use those resources as well.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Open many links at once in Safari Can several links be opened at once in Safari?\nImagine you are on a page with a lot of links:\n\nWould it be possible to select all the links and open them all in one single Command-click? As such:\n\nI am often finding myself Command-clicking links for dozens of minutes a day, and wishing I could open more links all at once. Surely I'm not the only person in this situation!\n\nA: There is a way to do something close - it involves adding a bookmarklet to Safari and selecting that once you're on the page. \nHowever, this will either open only the hyperlinks you've selected (i.e. highlighted) on the page or it will open all hyperlinks found on the page if you haven't highlighted any. In other words, it doesn't work in the Command + click manner you want.\nIf you're interested, here's the process to set this up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit any page using Safari\n\n*Press CommandD to add a bookmark to the page you just visited \n\n*In the highlighted field that appears in the window, change the text to something like Open all hyperlinks\n\n*Press OptionCommandB to edit bookmarks\n\n*Find the bookmark you just added and right-click on it\n\n*Select Edit Address... from the context menu\n\n*This should highlight the URL. Press Delete to remove it\n\n*Now paste the following code where the URL was previously:\n\n\njavascript:(function(){var n_to_open,dl,dll,i; function linkIsSafe(u) { if (u.substr(0,7)=='mailto:') return false; if (u.substr(0,11)=='javascript:') return false; return true; } n_to_open = 0; dl = document.links; dll = dl.length; if (window.getSelection && window.getSelection().containsNode) { /* mozilla */ for(i=0; i<dll; ++i) { if (window.getSelection().containsNode(dl[i], true) && linkIsSafe(dl[i].href)) ++n_to_open; } if (n_to_open && confirm('Open ' + n_to_open + ' selected links in new windows?')) { for(i=0; i<dll; ++i) if (window.getSelection().containsNode(dl[i], true) && linkIsSafe(dl[i].href)) window.open(dl[i].href); } } /* /mozilla */ if (!n_to_open) { /*ie, or mozilla with no links selected: this section matches open_all_links, except for the alert text */ for(i = 0; i < dll; ++i) { if (linkIsSafe(dl[i].href)) ++n_to_open; } if (!n_to_open) alert ('no links'); else { if (confirm('No links selected. Open ' + n_to_open + ' links in new windows?')) for (i = 0; i < dll; ++i) if (linkIsSafe(dl[i].href)) window.open(dl[i].href); } } })();\n\n\n*Press Return to accept the code\n\n\nTo make this work, open any page in Safari and then select the bookmarklet. One of the following things will happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you haven't highlighted any hyperlinks on the page, the code will proceed to open all hyperlinks in a separate tab\n\n*if you've highlighted x number of hyperlinks, then the code will proceed to open those selected hyperlinks in separate tabs\n\n\nIMPORTANT: If this doesn't work for you, ensure that you have Javascript enabled. You can do this via Safari > Preferences > Security.\nOne more thing - I have tried many times to get the above javascript to work as a Service in Safari (thinking that would be better than the bookmark approach), but have never been able to get it to work.

Both old machine and new are running El Capitan.\n\nA: The ‘Import to Notes’ function imports text files. Notes itself stores its files in a SQLite database, which is contained within the group.com.apple.notes group container.\n~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/\n\nTo use this as your Notes database, quit Notes and copy the contents to the group container on your current system.\n\nA: I had this issue when I bought a second Macbook. I thought it would be simple to use iCloud to sync the two. Unfortunately this is a very unreliable process as reported by many people. I decided to write a bash shell script to deal with it. It works perfectly. You can double click on the backup/restore files seen in Finder. I backed up to Dropbox but you can modify the scripts to write/read to someplace different. I can't figure out how to upload the scripts here so will just include them below as text. There are plenty of comments in the script so you should be able to work out the process. The main script will back up the whole of the Notes app directories. It will also create a suitable restore script to restore the backups to any other Mac.\n#!/bin/bash\n#set -x\n\nDT=`date \"+%y%b%d\"`\nSAV_DIR=~/Dropbox/Notes\nNOTE_DIR=~/Library/Group*/group.com.apple.notes*\nTARFILE=Notes.$DT\nRESTORE_FILE=notes_restore.$TARFILE.$HOSTNAME.sh\n\n#echo DT=$DT\n#echo SAV_DIR=$SAV_DIR\n#echo TARFILE=$TARFILE\n#echo RESTORE_FILE=$RESTORE_FILE\n#ls -ld $NOTE_DIR\n\n# Preserve ownership, permissions and full path to ensure files are\n# restored to original locations\n# ** You need to use tar xPpf to preserve full path and permissions on\n# ** the restore command as well else the leading / will be removed and\n# ** the files will be restored relative to where you run the command\n\ntar cfpP /tmp/$TARFILE.$HOSTNAME.tar $NOTE_DIR\nmv /tmp/$TARFILE.$HOSTNAME.tar $SAV_DIR\n\n# ------------ Create Restore Script ----------------\n\n# The restore script will have the same name, date and hostname\n# as the notes tar file saved in the Dropbox folder\n# The file can be seen in the Finder Dropbox window. A double click\n# on it will run the restore script.\n# This ensures that you can export the Notes app files to dropbox\n# from any host and restore to any host by selecting the appropriate\n# tar file restore script\n\necho \"#! /bin/bash \"                                >  /tmp/$RESTORE_FILE\necho \"cp $SAV_DIR/$TARFILE.$HOSTNAME.tar /tmp\"      >> /tmp/$RESTORE_FILE\necho \"tar xPpf /tmp/$TARFILE.$HOSTNAME.tar\"         >> /tmp/$RESTORE_FILE\necho \"/bin/rm /tmp/$TARFILE.$HOSTNAME.tar\"          >> /tmp/$RESTORE_FILE\n\nchmod 755 /tmp/$RESTORE_FILE\nmv /tmp/$RESTORE_FILE $SAV_DIR\n\n\nA: I would check the contents of the zip files he sent you. As @grg said you can only import text files. There is a 3rd part app called Note2Txt.app that will write all your notes as text files in a folder you choose. You could copy the folder to the new computer and import the folder into Notes. Now if you look in \"Imported Notes\" you'll see all your previous notes.\n\nA: Just wanted to share: What if we need to transfer just a couple of Notes from 1 mac to another, but the target Mac already has existing Notes?\nAnd you want to preserve style and text formatting, too?\nTextEdit to the rescue!\n\n*\n\n*Copy-paste Note content to TextEdit. (This preserves formatting)\n\n*Send TextEdit file via e-mail or Slack to yourself (or Air drop).\n\n*Open the TextEdit file in the 2nd Mac, and copy-paste to Notes.\n\n", "Q: Download folder from iCloud Drive web I want to download a folder from iCloud Drive using the web interface (iCloud.com). The only problem is, since it is not zipped, I cannot download the folder. Is there a way to download the folder without having to sync the entire content of my iCloud Drive with my computer?\n\nA: You can compress folders on iPhone Documents. Then you can download zip\n\nA: No proper solution\nUp today (2021-03-13), there is no immediate way to download a specified folder from iCloud.\nThe download button is grayed/disable for folders in iCloud.com.\nBelow there are only hacks.\nThe evident (and painfully) approach\nYou can select all the files inside the desired folder and click the download button, but since it does not include subfolders, you must patiently repeat the process for each folder in the tree.\nRequest Apple a copy of your data\nGo to https://privacy.apple.com/ and request to Apple a copy of your iCloud files.\nUnfortunately, you cannot select which folder you want to include; you will receive a link to download the whole drive.\nThey say it could take a few days to receive the link. However, in my experience, it only takes a day.\nYou can also use this trick to download other data that Apple makes it difficult to obtain in a standard format, such as the Health App data.\nThe iPhone solution (the best approach)\nSo, the original question request a solution \"without having to sync the entire content of my iCloud Drive with my computer\".\nI had the same problem. I was not using iCloud Drive in my Mac, but it was active (probably by default) on my iPhone.\nThen, I could use the File app (the built-in App) to copy the whole folder to the internal storage of my iPhone or to other cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.).\n\n*\n\n*Ensure your other cloud is active within the File App.\nSelect (...) > Edit in the upper right corner of the File application initial view to activate the available cloud accounts.\n\n\n*Browse to the folder you want to copy from iCloud.\n\n\n*Long press on the folder name to activate further option, then select Compress to create a zip file of the folder.\n(You can skip this step, but I recommend it if you are planning to copy to another cloud and not for the internal iPhone storage)\n\n\n*Long press on the zipped folder, then select Copy or Share.\n\n\n*Select a destination for your zipped folder.\n\n\n*Wait. It could take longer to copy from one cloud to the other.\n\n\n*Use the other cloud to download your files.\n\n\n*Complaint to Apple!\nComplaint to Apple\nMeanwhile, complain to Apple about this unbelievable omission\nhttps://www.apple.com/feedback/icloud.html\n\nA: The Mac iCloud document sync now only downloads stubs for files you do not need synced. In my experience, it does a light sync when you have 20 GB or more of files in the cloud (or have low space on your Mac already)\nIt watches as you use files - seamlessly downloading them only when you are using them and they stick around as long as you have local space - freeing up oldest first when you start to get close to space being needed on your local storage.\n\nWhen this is set up, you can zip the folder on the Mac, drag them to another place or click the icon next to the folder name that has a cloud and down arrow to request just those files download now.\n\n\nA: Yes, you can do this.  The following assumes that you're already logged-in to your iCloud account and you have the ability to download files to your local drive.\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to your iCloud Drive in any browser.\n\n*Change your browser's default download location to wherever you want the files to be located.  You must do this now because you can't select a new location once you click the 'download' button later.\n\n*Go into the folder that you want to download.  You can't just highlight the folder and try to download the folder and its contents from here.  You actually have to go into the folder first.\n\n*Select all the files you want to download.  Do this either by selecting each one or by doing a select-all keyboard command.\n\n*Once all the files are selected, go to the top of the iCloud screen and click the 'download' icon (cloud with arrow going down).  This will download all the selected files to your default download location (set in step 2).  The files should not be downloaded in a zip format, they should come down exactly as they're stored in iCloud.\n\nAll the files will download which, in essence, is what you wanted by selecting the folder and trying to download that first.\n", "Q: Can I Airplay from one mac to another? (or from iOS to Mac) I have a Mac connected to a large 27 inch monitor. I want to be able to remotely push audio and video to it. The source device can be an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac.\n(Imagine a dorm room situation, where I want to play Netflix, or other media on the big screen, from my phone, and use that phone as a remote)\nAs a developer, I've come across some bugs in the past that make it appear that an OSX could act as an Airplay Target. \nIs there any way I can make this happen?\n\nA: You can AirPlay from your iOS device to your Mac using Reflector 2. This works on macOS Sierra.\n\nA: Elmedia Player\nThe app Elmedia Player turns your Mac into an AirPlay receiver, for both audio and video.

How do I curtail this?  Most advice columns say to go to my plugins and check \"Play on click\", but Google updated the browser and this option is no longer available.  What can I do?\n\nA: Every \"Helper\" is either a tab, a subframe, a core Chrome process or an extension.\nYou could reduce RAM usage by uninstalling extensions, or just using less tabs.\n\nA: I figured it out. It was eating up over 300% of my mac's memory and making my computer heat up like an oven even though I've only had it for a few months. To solve this I opened Activity Manager (located in the utilities folder in the applications), and control-clicked on the google chrome helper until I got a window (had to double click). At the bottom of the window there was a quit button and I clicked it and it closed it out and my chrome still works fine.\n\nA: I have quite a good experience with this \"Google Chrome Helper\" and how to debug the notorious problems on Mac. \n1. CHROME EXTENSION\nIn this case go to the 3 dots you find on the right upper side of your browser and then More Tools > Extensions, here you can have an overview of all your extensions. \nDeactivate all of them and relaunch Chrome. \nIf the issue is resolved we can now point out that the issue was related to one of your Extension. But what extension? You can now reactivate one by one while you have your Activity Monitor open and see when the \"Google Chrome Helper\" is trigged. \n2. CHROME EXTENSION OR CHROME SYNC\nSometimes you can find the Chrome extension that is draining your CPU but you have to work and keep that Chrome Extension available. Or maybe that Extension is managed by your Company and you cannot disable it. \nIn this case you have to click on your Chrome account on your browser and sigh out from all of your Accounts. \nNow close your browser, reopen it and \"Google Chrome Helper\" shouldn't bother you at all. Well, this is normal, because you are not signed in. Now Sign in into Gmail but don't never ever click on the \"Turn on sync...\" button\n\nNow you can also install the Chrome Extension that was giving you pain and you shouldn't experience any problem. Just don't touch that \"Turn on sync...\" button.\n3. I STILL HAVE PROBLEMS\nWell, in this case you are facing something I haven't faced myself. The only suggest you I can give you is to debug the issue by yourself. When the CPU is spiking high open the Activity Monitor and target the \"Google Chrome Helper\", look at that line and take the PID number (in the picture that you can see in the question is 29048).\nNow open a terminal and run: \nkillall -9 29048\nThis way you have now killed the process itself. Try to spot what has changed in your Chrome: maybe an Extension has been deactivated, maybe a tab was closed, maybe a webpage has become unresponsive. Dig and you will find the solution.\n\nA: You NEED to disable Flash in Chrome preferences/advanced/content.\n", "Q: Is there a way to prevent recent applications from moving to the far left when switching with Command-Tab?

So I don't really remember how this happened, but during some sort of update I accidentally signed into icloud with my personal account instead of my work account. Somewhere in this process I actually activated icloud, so now ALL of my work stuff from my work machine is in iCloud, I'm not entirely sure how to get it back on my desktop without also putting a bunch of personal info and documents on the machine, and I'm hoping to fix this before anyone notices a massive change in my bandwidth usage. Any ideas for how to do this?\n\nA: Did you logged out from iCloud on your working machine?\nFirst of all try to do this: System Preferences > iCloud > Sign Out\n\nA: So, what I ended up doing was disconnecting the machine from iCloud. I couldn't really do anything about the data that had been transferred (I figure once it's been downloaded the damage is already done) but I was able to find evertyhing by going to \nUser > iCloud Drive (Archive) and then subfolders for the machine. Unfortunately it also downloaded a LOT of personal data but I just deleted everything except for those particular subfolders. I was able to get everything back, so I guess that's a good thing, but I still never ever want to deal with this ever again. I'm going back to only using Dropbox.\n", "Q: Problem installing cover version I tried installing the visualizer plugin Cover Version with my new mac with OS Sierra. I followed the instructions and put the file in the itunes plugin folder, but it doesn't show up in iTunes among the Visualizer options.

Now it works perfectly\n", "Q: OS-wide equivalent of \"read later\" list? Is it possible to set up a shortcut so that whatever is in my clipboard goes into a specific text-file ?\nThe idea is to have an OS-wide inbox where I can send anything (img, pdf, text, url) quickly. Much like a generalized \"read later\" feature.\n\nA: Notes would be useful for this. There's a share extension for Notes which can be used by any app and which takes the current content straight into a note for you.\n\nDepending on the app, the extension may be in a variety of places, but for example in Safari you can go to File → Share → Notes.\n", "Q: Force iBooks on iOS to sync with iCloud I have my iBooks setup on both my iPhone and Mac so that their contents are always in sync. If I delete a book on my Mac, then it gets deleted on my iPhone, too. However, it usually takes 24 hours before it takes effect on the iPhone, after I delete a book on the Mac. \nHow can I force a sync on the iPhone so that updates are reflected immediately?\n\nA: I've found that if I want to ADD a book, then it's best to add it on my Mac. Then wait until it uploads to iCloud, then after about a minute it will appear in iBooks on my iPhone. I then hit the iCloud icon next to the book title to download it.\nIf I want to delete a book, then I delete it from my iPhone rather than my Mac. It will then walk you through a few options, until you reach the point where you say that you want to delete the book from ALL iCloud devices. Then it will also delete it from your Mac, after about a minute.\n", "Q: How to enable iCloud Photo Library on new computer without losing existing photos in iCloud We got a new iMac and would like to enable iPhone Photo Library on it so it can download photos onto it from our existing iCloud Photo Library. However, since this is a new computer, our Photo library on it is empty, so before I enable iCloud Photo Library, I wanted to make sure my iCloud Photos are safe.\nIf we enable iCloud Photo Library on our new iMac with the empty photo library, will it download our existing photos or will it try to sync the empty library to iCloud and possibly wipe out our photos?\n\nA: You can safely enable iCloud Photo Library. When you do that, Photos will always treat the iCloud content as canonical. It will download everything from it to the device, and if that device has additional content, it will upload that content, merging it with iCloud, so that new content will also be available to other devices as well. \n", "Q: Paradox in understanding the \"order of booting\" of programs given by $PATH Background\nThis tutorial on how to \"properly install git\" on OSX 10.8.5, says:\n\nTo run the latest version you need to adjust your shell path so that\n/usr/bin/git runs after /usr/local/bin\n...\nSo add into the path [in my case: ~/.bash_profile] similar to the below and keep what you already\nhave in the path, each segment is separated by a colon:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin/git:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH\"\n\n                                   ^ Focus on this\n\n\nSo my understanding is this:\n\n*\n\n*when I log in, BASH will give priority to whatever is appended further on the right-hand side of the export PATH=... line\n\n*$PATH is at the righter-most : delimited entry in the export PATH=... line\n\n*$PATH contains /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin\nSo...

A better alternative would be to write\n\nTo run the latest version you need to adjust your shell path so that /usr/local/bin is searched before /usr/bin\n\nSo if you set PATH to /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin the manually installed version of git will be picked from /usr/local/bin.\nPS: Handling of PATH works the same for all Unix-based systems, the various directories are searched for the command from left to right.\n", "Q: Deleting IOS 9.3.5 on iPad 2? sorry if this has been asked before.\nI was told that IOS 10 won't download on iPad if IOS 9.3.5 is already installed.

I forced restart it. And now it can't get past loading screen I was working, when I noticed my phone screen suddenly goes black with the familiar white circle animation. I can't do anything to my phone (and I'm now afraid it was a forced iOS system upgrade). After waiting for a moment, I decided to force restart it (press power + home) because even an iOS system upgrade doesn't take that long in the waiting screen. The iPhone restarted, showing its usual black apple on white background logo. But I have waited for 5 minutes and there's no sign of it will ever finished. I restarted it again, but the result is the same. What should I do?\n\nA: I think a restore might be in order. \nFirst I would plug it on a Mac or PC with an USB cable and do a full encrypted backup. I suppose iTunes will still be able to back it up, but it might require you to authorize its access on the iPhone itself, in which case you'all have to rely on an iCloud Backup restore after the software restore.\n", "Q: iOS VPN On Demand with multiple VPNs I have 2 VPNs that I have created on demand profiles for. One is for an OpenVPN server that connects when my iPad is on cellular and disconnects otherwise. The other one automatically connects only on my school's wifi and is an AnyConnect server (only protocol usable at school).\nBoth of them connect and disconnect fine, but only when their respective VPNs are selected in the VPN settings. However, I have to manually switch them when switching networks--if the cellular VPN was in use, it will disconnect when I connect to school wifi but the school wifi VPN won't connect until I change the current VPN in the settings, which kind of beats the point.\nIs there any way to have them switch automatically? Right now I have the settings in two separate profiles, would combining them make a difference? Or am I out of luck?\n\nA: No, as of iOS 10.3, the VPN won't connect on demand, if it isn't selected in the VPN settings. Obviously, a non-selected VPN setting is meant to be completely inactive, including its on demand configuration. \nI experience the same problem, and am hoping for this feature to be in a coming iOS version, but I am not too positive about it.\nHowever, this answer applies to multiple VPNs of the same type. It seems that if they are of different types, multiple VPNs can be active and even connected at the same time, as described in this question.\n", "Q: Why does AirDrop only sometimes require me to open the AirDrop window on my desktop? When I'm sending things to my desktop from my iPhone, it randomly doesn't show my computer until I open up AirDrop in the Finder. Does anyone know why this is? (it just shows the blue circles instead of my Mac Pro)\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Pro Late 2013 (OS 10.12.3)\n\n*iPhone 6s (10.2.1)\n\n\n\n\nA: According to your devices, it should work reliably. But Apple documentation makes two relevant observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out if the Mac has “Block all incoming connections” turned on in Security & Privacy preferences. A Mac won't receive items using AirDrop if this setting is turned on. \n\n\n*If AirDrop on the receiving device is set up to receive items from contacts only, make sure that both devices are signed in to iCloud. Also make sure that the email address or phone number associated with your Apple ID is in the Contacts app of the receiving device.\n\n\n\nIf your Mac Pro is located on a safe environment, I would go to Finder > AirDrop and set it to accept files from anyone. It made my devices find each other much faster in my experience. It might do the trick for you.\n\nA: It depends of when your devices were built.\nAirDrop works differently on Macs from before 2012 -- AirDrop used Bonjour and personal area networking (PAN) to discover and transfer files between Macs. When AirDrop came to iOS 7 in 2013, it used Bluetooth LE and peer-to-peer Wi-Fi to transfer data. It was an incredibly secure implementation, but it wasn't compatible with the older version present on the Mac. MacOS now supports both versions of AirDrop — the Bluetooth LE/Wi-Fi protocol and the Bonjour/PAN combo — but it defaults to the former. \nCan you please post your Mac and iPhone specific models?\n", "Q: What is Department of Defense Root CA 2 doing on my Mac? I accidentally came across the keychain certificate part of my Mac and saw Department of Defense certificate. What is this certificate doing on my laptop. I am not a military member and never had any email account with them. I am not comfortable with this certificate on my laptop and for now I turned it off.\n\nA: It's one of the trusted certificate authorities for at least OS X Mavericks (10.9) through OS X El Capitan (10.11), so under those OS versions it'll be in the System Roots keychain. It was apparently removed in macOS Sierra (10.12); I don't know why.

(not file name) My question is in reference to the title shown in Acrobat Reader's tab and title bar that reads \"Modern business letter.\"\n\nI generated the PDF from a .docx document, and the document is generated based on a LibreOffice template (.odt) named \"Modern business letter\", which is where the title name comes from.\nI know how to change the template name in LibreOffice, but that can cause unwanted error if I forget to change it the next time I use the same template. Im looking for other macOS options so I don’t have to struggle in LibreOffice. \nHow do I change the individual PDF title, either in Acrobat Reader or in Finder?\n\nA: To answer the question you asked, \"How do I change the individual PDF title, either in Acrobat Reader or in Finder?\", you can't. Neither Acrobat Reader or Finder, by default and natively, have the capability to edit that information. It needs to be done before being exported/printed to PDF or use an app capable of editing PDF Documents.\nThe industry standard is Adobe Acrobat however it's an expensive app and overkill if looking to just edit that information.\n\nIf you have exiftool installed and want to do it from the command line in Terminal, use the following syntax:\nexiftool -Title=\"New Title\" /path/to/filename.pdf\n\n\n*\n\n*To clear the Title, just use: -Title=\"\"\n\n*Other meta-data can be changed in a similar fashion.\n\n\nA: You can do this through Automator.  Automator includes a number of functions to get and set PDF Metadata including things like \"Title.\"\nSuper Simple:  Create a Workflow Application...\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Workflow Application\n\n*Choose Set PDF Metadata (under the PDFs library)\n\n*Save; when you drop your PDF on the file, it will change the title for you.\n\n\nMore Steps, More Flexibility\nThe downside to that method is that while really simple, you can't programmatically change the Title (for whatever reason, you can't use variables in Set PDF Metadata).  It's great for batches if you wanted to change the Author or Keywords for a bunch of files.\nSo, to do this \"sorta\" programmatically, you have to do it within Automator\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Blank Workflow\n\n*Choose Get Specified Finder Items (Under Files & Folders Library)\n\n*Choose Set PDF Metadata (Under PDFs library)\n\n*Drag and drop your PDF into the top box\n\n*Run\n\n*Rinse and repeat as necessary\n\n\n\nA: You don't need elaborate steps nor additional software for macOS to change Title. Following applies both for existing pdf file and file you are creating from .docx or whatnot. Just print to PDF (for existing pdf file one needs to create new one) \n⌘ + P for printing and in opening printing window in the footer on the left side open drop-down menu and choose 'Save as PDF'. \n\nIt opens up Finder window for saving where you can set Title, Author, Subject, Keywords.\n\n\nA: I found on a iMac, you must open the Word document first and go into File > Properties > Summary and you can edit the name of the Title and Author of the document there. Re-save the Word document. Re-Save as a PDF as normal. \nWhen you open it in PDF, the tab will have the correct title.  \n\nA: Open the pdf file in text editor (e.g. Notepad++) and search for the current title, then type new title instead. Save.\nExample: I wanted to rename title of my pdf from \"MergedFile\" to \"123456\". I opened pdf in notepad++ and searched for \"MergedFile\". Found two instances and renamed both the \"123456\". Saved file. That's it.\n\nA: You may print the pdf into a pdf with typed a new title.\n", "Q: What determines whether a Bluetooth mouse can be paired with iOS? There are some Bluetooth mice that can be paired with an iOS device, for example the Citrix X1, or the Swiftpoint GT. These can be used in any app that supports them, like RDP clients, etc.\nA majority of Bluetooth mice do not even pair with iOS. I believe this is what prevents them from being used by apps. If they could pair, then I guess communication with them could be implemented in apps individually.\nWhy is that? What makes the Citrix X1 able to pair with iOS, which is missing in other mice?\nThe Apple Bluetooth accessory design guidelines document does not mention that the device must implement any additional Apple specific command, in order to be able to pair.\nI also don't believe that every dirt cheap Chinese Bluetooth accessory's manufacturer has had their device verified, and got some signed ID for it, or whatever.\nWhat makes the difference then?\n\nA: iOS does not support ordinary Bluetooth mice. \nOrdinary Bluetooth mice follow a standard by offering a HID (human-interface-device) detailing that it is a mouse (a specific type of pointer device). These would work with an ordinary Windows PC, Mac or other type of PC.\nOn iOS Apple have chosen not to support this. An argument could be that the iOS user interface is made for touch interaction, and not for use with a mouse.\nSpecific apps (primarily Remote Desktop apps) have added support for Bluetooth mice by implementing the whole thing themselves instead of relying on operating system for mice.\nThis means that the mice does not offer a standard HID mouse profile. To iOS these mice appear just as a \"generic\" Bluetooth accessory that the operating system does not support. Support is instead in each individual app.\nThe app (such as a remote desktop app) knows about this specific type of Bluetooth mice that are non-standard. They communicate with the mouse and receive data when the mouse is moved, buttons are pressed, etc. They have to on their own translate this data into actions on screen (i.e. determine which button was clicked, move the mouse pointer, etc.). None on this is done by iOS, but instead done by the app.\n", "Q: Time machine not deleting Mobile Backups after backing up on external harddrive This is a followup question to Can't find 68GB local backup folder (regular backups on an external hard drive)\nI found out that this folder, now 75GB, is my Mobile Backup folder from Time Machine.\nFrom my understanding the local Backups should be removed after making an external backup. However that's not happening anymore. I've used Time Machine since 2007 and never had that problem. \nI did a backup yesterday (27.Feb.) but I still have local backups from the 22.Feb. 24. Feb and 25. Feb. And the folder from the 22nd is 60 GB.\nI'm still using El Capitan and backup at least once a week. \nHas anyone encountered something similar? \nIs it save to just delete these folders after an external backup?\n\nA: Yes. It is safe to delete these backups after Time Machine has finished backing up the external hard drive. You can also disable local backups completely by executing the Terminal command sudo tmutil disablelocal.\nI have done this on my laptop because all the content I use is stored in the cloud (Google Drive & DropBox) and on remote private servers independently backed up.  \n", "Q: Is there any way to disable auto-shutdown from login screen when no user is logged in? A couple months ago when speaking to an Apple advisor about an unrelated issue, they told me the auto-shutdown was a \"security feature\". I think I may remember something about it only happening when Filevault is enabled. I know it is intended behavior as per Apple, but as I'm sure we all know, they do not always make the best decisions. If anyone has a solution to disable it, please let me know.\nThis seems to have been introduced in OS X Mavericks and has continued through at least OS X El Capitan—and most likely MacOS Sierra. If a Mac is started, and there is no login within a couple minutes, it will shut down after 5 minutes.\nThis is really bad from a remote perspective. Let's say I reboot the machine using ssh—if I don't reconnect and log in within this short timeframe, the computer will shut down, and then I have no way to connect to it. The only way to start the machine at that point is to have someone at the physical location. I've completely lost remote access to my machine for weeks because of this. This is not something that should happen without an option to disable it.\nMy only known workaround is to log in before it shuts down and then keep that user logged in. Unfortunately, this opportunity may be lost if restarting and connecting remotely with slow internet speeds. This functionality makes it so I cannot depend on an ssh connection to my machine.\nI have tested this again on all three of my Machines. 2 are personal and one is for work which has never had any account transfers or even so much as a remote connection to any of my other machines. It is consistently reproducible on these three entirely different machines and OS versions. They each have shut down from the log in screen exactly 5 minutes after boot. (Again, only after no activity or log-in). That is, completely shut down—not go into sleep mode.\nThis is consistently reproducible on all three of the Macs in my possession:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Pro (Late 2013) - 10.11.6 El Capitan\n\n*MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early\n2011) - 10.10.5 Yosemite\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) -\n10.9.5 Mavericks\n\n\nThere are no log messages for the time the auto shut down happens, but here are the times of restart, reboot and the corresponding logs from one of the machines:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot initiated at 9:02:30 AM\n\n*Mac had rebooted to login screen at 9:03\n\n*Auto shutdown at 9:08 (5 minutes after log in screen visible)\n\n*Mac was manually started again at 9:10:41AM\n\n\nLogs during that time:\n2/27/17 9:02:31.291 AM shutdown[1528]: reboot by [username]: \n2/27/17 9:02:31.000 AM kernel[0]: Kext loading now disabled.\n2/27/17 9:02:31.000 AM kernel[0]: Kext unloading now disabled.\n2/27/17 9:02:31.000 AM kernel[0]: Kext autounloading now disabled.\n2/27/17 9:02:31.000 AM kernel[0]: Kernel requests now disabled.\n2/27/17 9:02:31.291 AM shutdown[1528]: SHUTDOWN_TIME: 1488204151 290568\n2/27/17 9:02:31.291 AM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.xpc.launchd.domain.system) System shutdown initiated by: shutdown.1528<-sessionlogoutd.1527<-launchd.1\n2/27/17 9:02:31.000 AM kernel[0]: Process launchd [1] disabling system-wide I/O Throttling\n2/27/17 9:02:31.000 AM kernel[0]: Process launchd [1] disabling system-wide CPU Throttling\n2/27/17 9:10:41.000 AM bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1488204641 0\n\nIs there a way to prevent a Mac from automatically shutting down at the login screen after 5 minutes?\n\nA: I have not found a way to disable filevault auto-shutdown, but I have found a way to restart while bypassing the filevault pre-boot login screen (where the auto-shutdown happens). Entering this command in terminal will allow a remote restart without the risk of a shutdown:\nsudo fdesetup authrestart\nAfter entering the command and a password for sudo, you will need to enter either the filevault recovery key or a user password for a filevault-enabled user. This password will then be stored in memory and used automatically upon boot to satisfy the filevault authentication requirement. After the disk is decrypted, you will then be taken to the standard post-filevault login screen which doesn't trigger shutdown after 5 minutes.\nAdditionally, the authrestart command could be set to load a plist file automatically each time the computer is booted to authenticate filevault automatically, but this partially negates the purpose of filevault, and I don't think it's a great idea to store a password in a plist file.\nI found this information here.\nI'd still like to find a way to disable auto-shutdown permanently, but at least this is a workaround for the remote restart issues.\n\nA: Would this work?  It's a kludge.\nSet up a test user with minimal privilege. Set that user to not auto log out. Require password to disable screen saver.\nLogin as that user from the desktop.  That user being logged in keeps the machine from shutting down.\n", "Q: Jailbroken iPad 4 (ios 7.0.4), how to make a backup of only photos I want to make a backup on my pc of the photos because I want to finally reset it and update it. I already tried the sc way, but there was too much quality loss on my photos. The itunes way isn't viable, because for some reason my backup gets encrypted, I already searched online, the password is the first password of your itunes account. Too bad I changed it years ago. I tried SC on an Ubuntu 16.10 pc, but I also have access to a mac (10.12.3) and a Windows 10 machine.\n\nA: Use the Image Capture application on the Mac to export all of your photos. It will export the original qualities of all your photos. However, I'm not sure how it works out with \"Optimize Photo Storage\" on your device turned on. I'd suggest you to use this method only if you don't use iCloud's optimize storage option.\n\nA: This should work on any OS, but I am sure it works in *Nix/OS X.\nEssentially, we're going to manually copy the photos folder from the iPad to your computer. \nIf you plug the iPad into your computer with the USB cable, you should be able to mount it as a disk drive (there should be an Autoplay option in Windows, on Ubuntu it should automatically mount). Then, if you open the mounted folder, there should be a folder (which might be under some other folders) called DCIM. This folder should contain all of the pictures you have taken and/or saved on the iPad. Copy this folder your preferred way (Cmd/Ctrl-C, cp, rsync...) from the folder to your PC, and you'll have the folders backed up.\nI will update this with the exact paths by the end of the day.\n", "Q: What all file metadata is available in macOS? I have gone through Windows versioning information: Please Check out Windows file versioning information\nNow Windows provide quite an ample amount of information like productname, productversion, CompanyName, Comments, FileDescription and so on.\nI went through mdls command and that information is very less compare to what Windows provide. \nDoes anyone have idea how to get equivalent information for Mac OS's (preferably in Sierra & El-Capitan) files as well ?\n\nA: Applications on macOS store similar types of metadata in Info.plist files stored within the application bundles themselves.\nFor example to see the metadata available for Safari you can run the following command in a Terminal window.\nplutil -p /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info.plist\nOr to get the version of Safari specifically you can run...\nplutil -p /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep CFBundleShortVersionString\n\nA: While helpful, the accepted answer is incomplete.\n\n\n*\n\n*OP wanted a list of all file metadata in macOS.\n\n*The question is valid, but an exhaustive list don't exist afaik, as the set of metadata attributes is dynamic. \n\n*New keys are added e.g. whenever you install new software, and also appears to reflect which user is currently logged in. \n\n\n1.

First time Mac user. I am confused by the fact that the finder application is always open. For example, when switching apps with Cmd+Tab, it is always there, even when there are no windows opened for the app. Cmd-tabbing to Finder with no windows/tabs opened for it has no effect (it seems to me it would more intuitive to open a new tab when this action is chosen).\nFurthermore, there is no 'Close app' option when I right click the Finder icon in the dock. Am I misunderstanding something about the Finder app? Is it required for proper functioning of macOS? From what I see, Finder is just a file browser, which by no means should be forced to be open 100% of the time.\n\nA: The main reason it's always open is that it displays the icons on the desktop. You can check what the finder does by enabling the \"Quit\" menu feature. To do this, launch the Terminal application and enter the following commands:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool YES\n\nHit return. Then restart the Finder by running \nkillall Finder\n\nClose the Terminal. Click on the Desktop, choose \"Finder\" in the top bar, and \"Quit Finder\". Now you're running without Finder. First thing you'll notice is that all Desktop icons will be gone.\nTo get your desktop icons back, just click on Finder in the Dock.\nIf you want to remove the \"Quit Finder\" menu item, you can do that with:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool NO\n\n\nA: Think of the background process for Finder akin to that of the 'Windows Explorer' background process on Windows.  As mentioned above, it is essential for the MacOS UI & GUI elements on the desktop.  If you are new to Mac, take a look at the Activity Monitor App in your Utilities folder.  This is essentially the Mac equivalent to Task Manager on Windows and can help organize/debug processes in the background.\n\nA: It's not only a \"file browser\", but it's responsible for quite a bit of GUI functionality such as the Desktop, following paths and connecting to servers. Finder is always running, and a launch service will relaunch it if it is quit unnaturally. Much like File Explorer (explorer.exe) on Windows, you shouldn't quit it. Quit functionality can be added back to Finder, but you really shouldn't unless you have a very good reason for it.\n\nA: For myself, I found a good way to use the CommandQ shortcut in Finder.\nYou can configure CommandQ to close all Finder windows, as it does for other apps (except quitting Finder) as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n*Create a new shortcut as follows:\nApplication: \"Finder\"\nMenu title: \"Close All\"\nKeyboard Shortcut: \"Command Q\"\n\nNote that the original shortcut, CommandOptionW, will stop working.\n", "Q: Build in and build out of two images where one replaces the other in the same slide I'm creating a Keynote presentation. \nI have a slide with two overlapping images at the center of the slide.

But they are still being shown in Photos app, Why and how to delete them?\n\nA: If you're just right-clicking photos within Finder and selecting Move to Trash, this is only going to affect those particular files. For example, if you're doing that to JPEGs etc in your Pictures folder, you're only moving/trashing those files.\nThe Photos app (and iPhoto before it) store all imported pictures in a library. You can't delete these manually outside of the app (at least not without showing package contents and causing a whole heap of issues with metadata, etc). Instead you need to delete the photo(s) from within the Photos app.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within the Photos app select the photos you want to delete. (You can use Shift + click or Command + click to select multiple photos)\n\n*Right-click on any of the selected photos\n\n*You can choose to delete the photos (or even hide them if that's all you really want to do)\n\n\nNOTE: When you delete a photo it actually places it in the Recently Deleted trash can (appears above your albums). The photos will remain there until you choose to recover them, or until they are automatically deleted after 30 days. You can, however, choose to go in and manually delete them from there anytime prior to the 30 day period.\n\nA: First, make sure you've actually emptied trash. Next, as @Tetsujin said in the comments, make sure to delete them from Photos (inside the app), can be done on any device and on the next Cloud sync you should see them disappear from iOS and MacOS/OS X devices as well. \n", "Q: Error -36 \"some data can't be read or written\" when copying files from SD card I want to copy files from my SD card to my Desktop but for some of the files I get:\n\nThe Finder can’t complete the operation because some data in “GOPR0054.MP4” can’t be read or written.

This happens most often after installing an OS update.\nTo reregister all Notification Center widgets and Share Extensions, start a Terminal session, and enter the following:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -seed\n\n(Triple-click the above line and press ⌘ cmdc to copy, then ⌘ cmdv inside Terminal.)\n", "Q: Are there downsides to quitting the Finder after enabling the menu item to quit it? In Why is the Finder app always open?, it was noted that you could add a Quit menu item to the Finder via a Terminal command, but the comments and one of the answers seemed to indicate that this was a bad idea and should be avoided unless you had a could reason. Why is this this? Does this prevent the system from working correctly?\nI myself have enabled the Quit menu item in the Finder (via TinkerTool, rather than the command line) and find it useful for presentations where I don't want to show everybody my messy desktop or any open windows. I've also quit when I thought that I could use the extra RAM (like heavy Photoshop editing), although to be honest I don't know if that's effective. Are there any negative consequences that could result if I kept doing this?\n\nA: Finder is the application Mac uses to well... find files.\nIt should be perfectly fine so long as you do not run anything that specifically calls finder, i.e. AppleScript. You'll also (obviously) lose all your open Finder windows. \nI completely understand quitting for presentations, but there should not be much of a performance improvement if you quit Finder.\nSo, no, it should not be a problem, just note that apps that call on Finder should open Finder for you, so you'll need to quit it again. \nThanks to @user3439894 for catching me on something I said wrong. \n\nA: Finder is not just a file explorer application. It is responsible for certain GUI functionalities including showing desktop icons. While it is possible and relatively harmless to quit Finder, potential side effects may be more than the the benefit of the memory it frees.\n", "Q: How do I add spellcheck / dictionaries in macos Sierra?

Are there any other ways? I thought about including them into my dotfiles, but can not find the shortcuts using the defaults command.\n\nA: Since you're using dot files, if you know what shortcuts you want to create ahead of time, you can add them to all machines by adding the following defaults write commands to your setup script:\n\nPer App Shortcuts: defaults write com.developer.app NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Menu Item\" -string\n  \"keyboardShortcut\"\nGlobal Shortcuts: defaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Menu Item\" -string \"keyboardShortcut\"\n\n...where com.developer.app is the application's bundle ID, and keyboardShortcut is the letters of the keys you want to include, plus the symbols @, $, ~, and ^ representing the Command, Shift, Alt, and Control keys, respectively. For example, -string \"@~K\" would represent the keyboard shortcut ⌘⌥K.\n\nIf you need to sync existing shortcuts, you're going to have to make a more complicated script. I imagine this would involve reading or comparing shortcuts on a source machine via:\n\nPer App Shortcuts: defaults read com.developer.app NSUserKeyEquivalents\nGlobal Shortcuts: defaults read -g NSUserKeyEquivalents\n\n...and writing them to a target machine via:\n\nPer App Shortcuts: defaults write com.developer.app NSUserKeyEquivalents 'outputOfSourceMachine'\nGlobal Shortcuts: defaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents 'outputOfSourceMachine'\n\n", "Q: Is my macbook pro dying?

Know the SIM card hole where you insert a key and open? Ants randomly come from that. They are the smaller variety. I must have killed 20 of them by now. \nWill this be fatal for my iPhone? Is there any way to shoo them away?\n\nA: OK, so this is sooo far off topic that I can see it coming back round from the other side of the page...\nHowever, Pharaoh ants are about the only ones small enough to be doing what you describe. They love to live in small, warm places. They have an interesting method to combat being eradicated either by poisons or crushing. As soon as they feel they're under stress, the colony will bud, sending off new colonies to breed elsewhere.\nSo, this isn't a problem for your phone - put the phone in a plastic bag with a tiny squirt of ant poison spray.

The \"Find\" function can be manually accessed by pressing ⌘ command  + F .\nIs it possible for the cursor to be automatically placed in this location when the file is opened, perhaps with AppleScript?\n\nA: TextEdit does not have an option to preform some actions when a file is opened, e.g. to run an on open() handler that does things upon opening a file. That said, if you have a particular file you want to open in TextEdit and have Find show at the top of the document, you'll need to do it programatically.\nThe example AppleScript code below is saved as an application and placed in the Dock instead of the target document itself.

As a technician, I'd like to learn when an iOS update appears so I can prepare iTunes with all the recent restore images.  Any way to know that? or receive notifications when an new iOS update is released? (better if Apple official).\n\nA: ipsw.me provides an RSS feed of iOS releases at ipsw.me/timeline.rss. You can subscribe to this RSS feed (or a filtered version) using IFTTT. Templates are provided at ipsw.me/notifications. This is accurate to a couple of minutes.\nYou can also subscribe to the TSS status of iOS releases using the API available at api.ineal.me. This can be near instantaneous, providing a real-time view of TSS signing (and subsequently the releases).\n\nA: By default you will already automatically get a notification when an iOS update is available.\nTypically, after an iOS update is released, users should get a badge notification with a '1' sometime in the first 48-72hrs. However, an actual push notification may not come until quite some time after and only if your device hasn't been updated yet. \nUsing myself as an example, I have an iPhone 6s which I've had since September 2015 (it's now March 2017). In that whole time I've never had a push notification about an iOS update because I always update my iPhone fairly quickly. However, my wife who also got an iPhone 6s at the same time as I did, did get a push notification for iOS 10 at some point (weeks after iOS 10 launched) because she was still on iOS 9.3.5 and was in no hurry to update (I'm usually her guinea pig with these things). However, she did eventually update from iOS 9.3.5 to iOS 10 because the notification was relentlessly annoying her (and because iOS 10 was working well for me).\nIn summary\nWhat I am saying is that a badge icon should appear within 72hrs of the official release, and this badge icon appears on the Settings app icon. Once this happens you can do an iTunes backup prior to actually installing the update. While updates may download automatically, they won't install without your input. In other words, you should never get caught out.\n", "Q: Alternatives App Stores (iOS) : Security risks Alternatives App Stores (iOS) : Security risks\nHi, I recently downloaded an iOS app from an unofficial store (GBA4iOS, from Builds.io website).\nBefore installing any application, you have to install the developper profile on your device.\nIs there any security risks by using those apps? \nI mean, can they bypass Apple restrictions?

I just daren’t risk losing everything on the mac either in my user page or his ... has anyone come across this problem and how did you solve it ? \n\nA: You shouldn't be using the same Apple ID for two different people, so ideally yes you should sign out of the Apple ID entirely and create a separate one.\nIf you still wish to use the same Apple ID, you can just disable Safari sync by opening System Preferences → iCloud and disabling Safari.\n                   \n", "Q: Icons disappearing from cmd+tab application switcher When using my MacBook for a while (Sierra, 10.12.3) then using cmd+tab to switch applications, I sometimes lose application icons.

Okay so, I have a Macbook Pro mid-2012 macOS Sierra 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD. I need Matlab for my work. And whenever I put Matlab on installation it does install up to 60% but in it sixties somewhere the Mac crashes. Showing me a gray background saying \"You are seeing this screen because of a problem with your mac...\". I cannot understand where is the problem. \nThere is another problem. That is, my mac wont will work properly if I used it as long as I want then turn it off and wait for an hour or so to start it again. If I start it up right-away it would show a prohibition symbol on bootup and in verbose mode would say \"Read Error--Kernel Cache Read error\"\n\nA: You never mentioned which version of MATLAB you were running.  However, the 9.0 (R2016a) doesn't mention Sierra at all and the R2016b which does list Sierra support has it as \"limited.\"  \nFirst thing I would do is verify that your version of MATLAB is compatible with Sierra.\nSecondly, a read error is indicative of a drive error.  It could be a corruption of the file or it could be a physical error.  You need to at least run First Aid on your drive to see if there are any problems.\n", "Q: How does one find the plug-in setting on Chrome for Mac to aid in stopping Chrome Helpers processes from running? I recently noticed that I had about 4 or 5 Google Chrome Helper processes running in my Mac. I have no windows opened on chrome and it seems that the Helper processes still stay there regardless. I looked at the other question Why does Google Chrome launch multiple instances of Google Chrome Helper? and this good article explaining what the issue is and how to solve it. They suggest to follow the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*shut down all your Chrome windows without quitting the program.\n\n*go to “Preferences,” scroll all the way down in the menu\n\n*click on “Show advanced settings…”\n\n*The first item in the expanded advanced settings list will be “Privacy,” and click on the “Content Settings” button right under that.\n\n*(step that fails for me) About halfway down the content settings list is a “Plug-ins” entry, which will likely be set to “Run automatically.” Instead, select “Click to play.”\n\n\nThe instructions are clear and easy to follow but it seems that the plug-ins button doesn't exist or it was moved. Does someone know where the plugins section went to? \nI don't know even if we find the new section for the plugins if it would solve the problem, but if it doesn't, can we truly get these chrome helper processes to go away?\nAs a side remark, I did go to the extensions section of chrome and I disabled all of my extensions, however, I still have at least 3 chrome helper windows running. Why is that? Can we get rid of them in anyway?\n\nIt seems that the main issue is that the new extension section has no clear (analogous to the article) way of preventing auto-helping to enable. This seems to be my main goal. To have the auto-helping turned off. In particular I want it to work as this sentence of the article suggests:\n\nDisabling Helper’s auto-helping is easy, and it won’t prevent you from using plug-ins.\n\nRight now the extension section has no analogous section to the \"Click to play\" which seems to play the following important role:\n\nThis is essentially the same thing as configuring email to load images\n  only when you click a “load images” link. Any embedded Flash, Java,\n  Quicktime, DivX, or Silverlight content on a webpage will appear as a\n  grayed-out space until you click on it to load the player and the\n  content.\n\nRight now the only way that (very) unreliable works is disabling the extensions. Which is of course not the solution I want or the solution the article alludes to.\nIs there a \"Click to play\" in the new chrome for mac?\n\nA: The Wired article is a bit old and perhaps is no longer current. 'Extensions' are what you're looking for, and they can be found in the menu item Window > Extensions.\nYou can also use Window > Task Manager to look at all the tab processes and extensions:\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, the modern day versions of Mac Chrome doe not seem to have \"Unsandboxed plugin access\" in Settings anywhere. I'm using Chrome 89.0.4389.90 (Official Build) (x86_64) for Mac. I am using macOS Big Sur v11.2.3 for reference. If anyone knows where to find it, please let me know. My Macbook Pro's relatively new batter, with only 60 cycles on it, that should last 8-12 hours, lasts a mere 3.5 hours with chrome running. I've deleted all but 1 extension (to my dismay as I love my extensions!) and it still isn't helping. Activity Monitor is showing 13 instances of \"Google Chrome Helper (Renderer) running, among other tasks. Oy vey -- any help much appreciated, as I've used MacBook Pro's with Chrome for the last 15 years without this type of battery challenge. Thank you!\n\nA: Since Chrome no longer allows you to disable \"Google Helper\" here is something else you can do to figure out what extension within Chrome is eating up your resources.\nFor Mac:\nGo to the Google Chrome Task Manager.\nOn a Mac go to Window >> Task Manager. \nHere is a video showing this process:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQLh-M4LrHU\nHope this helps!\n\nA: If you are feeling daring you could go through the chrome:\\\\flags (just put that in the address bar) to see if any help control background processes. The Throttle expensive background timers and Stop in Background look promising and there is one that disables autoplay. There is a search field on the page for locating the flags you want. Be warned, changing these could radically effect Chrome's behavior! \nTo answer your question: Chrome Helpers are core to Chrome functionality, they are not plug-ins per se. However there is a \"Unsandboxed plugin access\" setting in the advanced preferences which may be what you were looking for. \n", "Q: Bad configuration: cannot ssh As described in many other posts, after upgrading to MacOS Sierra I modified the ssh config file like so:\nHost me\nHostName login.hpc.ugent.be\nUser vscxxxxx\nPort 22\n\nHost *\n  AddKeysToAgent yes\n  UseKeychain yes\n\nStill I get the following error:\n$ssh -Y vscxxxxx@login.hpc.ugent.be\n/Users/manfredo/.ssh/config: line 8: Bad configuration option: usekeychain\n/Users/manfredo/.ssh/config: terminating, 1 bad configuration options\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: Apple's documentation on OpenSSH updates in macOS 10.12.2 states that:\n\nIf you are sharing your ssh configuration with systems running older versions of OpenSSH that don't understand the UseKeychain option, you can specify the IgnoreUnknown option to keep your configuration compatible with both new and old versions.\n\nSo the trick is that in your ssh config file, add IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain like below:\nHost *\n  AddKeysToAgent yes\n  IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain\n  UseKeychain yes\n\n\nA: Just remove the UseKeychain yes line from your configuration. The update broke existing setup by removing this option.\n\nA: If you specify /usr/bin/ssh for the commands, it works. The default path in 10.12 puts /usr/local/bin at the top so any other version of ssh will not work with that option, since it's specific to the mac system.\n", "Q: Does iOS have a built in file manager? Does iOS 10.2.1 have a built in file manager?  If so, where is it?\n\nA: No, it does not.  A goal of iOS is to remove the idea of files and folders and allow the user to focus simply on their data and accessing it whenever they want and wherever they are.\nIf you need a file manager, you'll need to jailbreak first and then use a myriad of 3rd-party file managers available.\n\nA: Because in iOS, the app is the starting point for all concepts, the file is not, the concept of \"file\" is not even allowed to exist, so there is no File Manager.\nAfter using iOS, compared to other systems, everything is so simple. Go to the AppStore, find the software, click on the download, it's so simple, you can use it, some simple and clear. As for the modification of the software and the cracking of the game itself is not allowed, Apple can not tolerate the system caused by non-technical reasons.\nSo if you want a file manager in iOS, you have to jailbreak your iphone.\n", "Q: Iphone 6 black screen of death? I foolishly let my iPhone 6 rest on my counter in my bathroom while I took a shower. A little while later I went to use my phone and all I got was an illuminated black screen. I plug it in. 10 minutes later I notice it's illuminating, but black screen present.\nSo I try to hard-reset it. Now all I have is a really black screen that does nothing. BUT I know it's on! It's working (somewhat) because my car's bluetooth picked it up today. So what can I do? I have it sitting in rice. Whether this is helpful or not at this point I am terrified of losing it. \nAnother dumb thing is I never backed my phone up, like ever.\nSo if I do take it in and they say they can't fix it, I've just lost everything. \nIs there any hope this can be fixed? 2 stores have told me there's little they can do but run diagnostics and see what works and what doesn't.\n\nA: If it's just your screen that is not working properly, as it appears from your description, you can use a screen replicator like Reflector 2.  \nYou can connect your iPhone to your computer and use the screen representation to perform an iCloud backup.  \n\nReflector is a wireless mirroring and streaming receiver that works great with Google Cast™, AirPlay™ and AirParrot 2®. Mirror your content to the big screen without wires or complicated setups. Play games, watch movies, demo applications or present from the palm of your hand. Even send your screens directly to YouTube for others to watch live. \n\nIf your device needs to be replaced, you can then restore your data from the iCloud backup.\n", "Q: Uninstalling Nokia Flasher Harmattan My MacBook Pro runs El Capitan. By mistake, I installed Nokia's flasher 3.12.1 (which they say is for Harmattan - to be honest, I do not really know what this means, but I content myself to know this is the wrong one). It is a command line utility. Now I would like to uninstall it, but I do not know how to locate all related files (they are spread in various locations - this is all I know). I tried to run again the installer and look at its log, but I cannot understand it. Any idea?\n\nA: The package available for download at MacFlasher_3.12.1.dmg contains the following files which you can remove manually. You can also remove the package receipt from /var/db/receipts/.\n                                                  \nTo find this list of files from the package, I extracted the package to a custom location using the following, then inspected the contents of the temporary directory.\npkgutil --expand /path/to/nokia_flasher.pkg /path/to/temporary\n\nFor an automated solution, try using UninstallPKG. This will parse the package receipt and allow you to remove the files.\n", "Q: In MacOS, how can I group the processes based on apps? I want to know the resources used on the basis of applications. I found a duplicate, but the answer there has issues and since its over a year old, I decided to post a new one, instead of posting there.\nThe solution in the previous post was, Activity Monitor>View>\"All Processes, Hierarchically\". But that has an issue:\nDid I do something wrong or is this a bug? Is there any other way of knowing it?\n\nA: These Google Chrome Helper processes are sub-processes of the Google Chrome app. You'll notice that the highlighted sub-process is indeed at the top of all the other sub-processes in the list - the proper hierarchy. You did nothing wrong, nor is there a bug.\n", "Q: How to change scrollbar position in AppleScript? I have an AppleScript .scpt file that is assigned to a keyboard shortcut via the third-party application, FastScripts.\nThe script opens a specific, fixed, pre-determined URL in a new Google Chrome tab. This new tab is inserted immediately after the currently open Google Chrome tab (if Google Chrome is currently open).\nHere is this code:\nactivate application \"Google Chrome\"\n\nset myURL to \"https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/12345\"\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    activate\n    tell front window to make new tab at after (get active tab) with properties {URL:myURL}\nend tell\n\nAn additional operation that I would like to implement in this script is to have the scrollbar of the opened webpage in Chrome automatically move downwards a bit. Just like the URL variable, the scroll amount is specific, fixed, and pre-determined.\n\nI don't know the proper way to articulate a scroll amount to you in writing (and it of course varies based on one's screen resolution, monitor size, window size, and the zoom setting set in Chrome for that given page), but I can say that, for my unique environment, it is around 15% down the page. To clarify the meaning of this description, \"100% down the page\" would be at the lowest scrollbar position (the scrollbar can be set to this position by pressing ⌘ command  + ↓).\nThe exact scroll amount that I desire is probably not particularly relevant in the context of my question (considering the many aforementioned variables that may affect the scroll amount). It is simply important to note that the scroll amount is a custom figure, as opposed to being at the very top or very bottom of the page (since one can use the respective keyboard shortcut via key code in AppleScript to easily accomplish scrolling to these two locations).\nI am hoping that whatever solution is suggested offers me the ability to fine-tune and adjust the desired scrollbar location, so that I can get it as close as possible to where I would scroll manually.\n\nA: Based on the additional information you provided in the comments, let me offer the following example code of how I'd do it. (At least until I learned a better way.)\nset myURL to \"https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/12345\"\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    set bounds of front window to {0, 23, 1440, 850}\n    tell front window to make new tab at after (get active tab) with properties {URL:myURL}\n    repeat while (loading of active tab of front window is true)\n        delay 1\n    end repeat\n    activate\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        repeat 9 times\n            key code 125 -- # Down Arrow\n            delay 0.1\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The value of the delay command in the repeat while ... loop can be adjusted to something more or less as you see fit based on how fast that page actually loads, you'd want to minimize the number of times the event triggers just so you don't unnecessarily over trigger the event. It's necessary for the page to finish loading, otherwise the next repeat loop will not scroll the appropriate amount. (I'm obviously using the term scroll figuratively.) \n\n*In the tell application \"System Events\" statement/block, you might need to adjust the number of time the repeat loop triggers. The delay command in this repeat loop is necessary otherwise the key code event, in this use case, does not register on the page properly. \n\nA: You can use the JavaScript to set the scroll amount.\nTo adjust the scroll with a defined percentage:\nset myURL to \"https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/12345\"\nset scrollAmount to \"16\" --- % down the page\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    activate\n    tell front window to set curTab to make new tab at after (get active tab) with properties {URL:myURL}\n    tell curTab\n        repeat while (loading)\n            delay 1\n        end repeat\n        -- set the vertical scroll \n        execute javascript \"h=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-document.documentElement.clientHeight; window.scrollTo(0,h*\" & scrollAmount & \"/100)\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nTo adjust the vertical scroll at the top of an element in the page, the script can get the element with document.getElementById('twc-scrollabe') twc-scrollabe is the identifier of the table.\nAfter that, the JavaScript use a loop to get the top of the table in the page\nset myURL to \"https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/12345\"\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    activate\n    tell front window to set curTab to make new tab at after (get active tab) with properties {URL:myURL}\n    tell curTab\n        repeat while (loading)\n            delay 1\n        end repeat\n        -- scroll to the top of the table\n        execute javascript \"e=document.getElementById('twc-scrollabe');tTop=0; do {tTop +=e.offsetTop || 0; e=e.offsetParent} while(e); window.scrollTo(0,tTop);\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe problem with this JavaScript (on another URL), you must find the identifier in the source of the page and change it in the script, if the element does not have an identifier, you must use other methods to get the element, the JavasScript code will be different depending on the page of the site.\n", "Q: Require a Password When Woken From Sleep Only When Specifically Requested? I want to create one hotkey that puts my monitor to sleep without requiring a password to wake it, and another hotkey that puts my monitor to sleep which does require a password to wake it.\nI'll be using BetterTouchTool to create the hotkeys - but how do I create one that requires a password and another that doesn't?  Bonus points if I can do this using Applescript since I already have a BTT/Applescript hotkey for when I'm leaving the house which turns off my Hue lights, mutes my Mac and puts my monitor to sleep.\nI realize I can go into system prefs > security & privacy and select \"require password immediately after sleep or screen saver\" but that would mean I'd have to enter my password every time I put my monitor to sleep, which is what I don't want.\n\nA: The following assumes you have/use a Login password:\ndo shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\"\n\nThis can be used in AppleScript to invoke the Login window, which will not close whatever you currently have open and as such when you log back in, your Desktop is as you left it.\nThis way you can have the \"Require password ... after sleep or screen saver begins\" check box in Security & Privacy's General tab unchecked but still not let someone have immediate access after you walk away, having invoked the Login window. \n", "Q: Do \"Click to Tweet\" and \"Click to Post\" still exist?

I just got an email from Dropbox saying that they are disabling the Public folder feature as of March 15, 2017 and I'm looking for a (free) alternative.\nI use the public folder quite extensively, especially to \"attach\" screen caps/recordings in web forms or emails when submitting an attached file is not an option.  I have probably even linked a few files from my blog.\nApparently, you can still generate public links to specific files with Dropbox, but there is no longer a way to share a group of files publicly to browse, without generating a link to each one. So you can't just drop files in a public folder and instantly allow anyone to browse them. Sharing a folder is now only possible to specific users via entering their email address.  Any files in your public folder which did not have links generated are no longer public.\nSo I would like to find an alternative cloud drive service that not only has a public folder, but also allows generation of public links via a Finder contextual menu.\nI discovered that Google Drive can generate public links, but there's no way (that I know of) to get the public link via the Finder.  I've used MEGA and Copy in the past, both of which could generate links from the Finder.  MEGA folded and I don't remember what happened with Copy, but I assume they put up a pay wall.  I was just reading through the OneDrive site and could not determine whether they even had a public folder, let alone a way to get a public link to a file from the Finder.\nI also have searched a tiny bit for some google drive API documentation to see if there's a method I can use to create an automator service to create/copy a public link.  Couldn't find anything.\n\nA: I don't know if we are taking about the same, but I used to use also quite much the public folder but since I can get a link to any file in my Dropbox, right clicking on it, I am not using it so much anymore and have my file in proper folders. \nHave you tried right clicking and getting a link to file in your Dropbox but not in your public folder?\n", "Q: Why are my app settings not appearing in the Settings app? I cannot seem to find my app settings in the setting app after updating my iphone to iOS 10.3 beta 4 (14E5260b).\n\nThe issue is still present even after waiting a night, so it's not an issue about apps taking a long time to load.\nWere they moved or removed? If they were moved, can you tell me where I could now find them?\n\nA: I experienced this issue for the first time this morning, on iOS 10.3. To fix, I simply opened multitasking view (double-click Home), and ejected the Settings app. Upon reopening it, app settings returned beneath TV Provider.\nI’m quite surprised at the number of bugs with the Settings app since iOS 10 (another would be the disappearing navigation arrow in the upper-left).\n\nA: I am a iOS developer, and I just ran into this in an app I'm building.\nFrom what I can tell, the application is only added to the setting app if\n\n*\n\n*The app developer adds an additional set of files to the app called the settings.bundle which ops into listing the app in the settings app. If the developer has done this the app will be added to your settings app, when the app is installed on your device.\n\n*Or if the user grants the application permissions that are listed under app settings (this includes things like location permissions, or notification permissions). In this case the app will not be listed in the settings app until one of these permissions is granted by the user.\n\nBy default the app will not be listed in the settings app by default. If you want to have it added to your settings app, try granting it permissions to send you push notification, or access your location.\nThere is an issue where, if you've denied the app permission to use these features, the app may not be able to ask you to give it permission again, and you will not be able to access it's permissions via the settings app to grant the app permission to use these features. In this case you will need to delete the app from your device and re install it in order for the app to be able to ask you to grant it permission.\n\nA: This appears to be a bug in iOS and quite an old one at that. It may be caused by an app providing bad settings metadata, but I haven't yet found the true cause. I've seen two solutions work.\nYour best bet is to try just killing and reopening the Settings app. I've seen this work on at least a few occasions so it should be your first attempt. However, if that fails you, another solution that I've seen work is to go into Settings->General->Reset and choose Reset All Settings.\nHowever, be warned, you'll lose literally all your settings, including passcodes, fingerprints, wi-fi connections, device name, etc. etc.\n\nA: My solution was to uninstall/reinstall one app. It was then that all installed apps reappeared in Settings. \n\nA: Kill all te apps. Click the home button twice and swipe all the apps stored on your screen until they are all gone. Only your home screen should be showing. \n\nA: Some of my apps but not all of them were showing in settings. In Settings ->Notifications, I was missing my Class Dojo app entirely.  I was not receiving instant messages from my son's teacher but couldn't change the settings. Some online answers recommended uninstalling/reinstalling the entire SETTINGS app, but I didn't want to reset ALL my passwords etc.  (I just did that a few weeks ago when I had to get a new phone after speaker wasn't working. In fact, that's when I started having problems). I just un/reinstalled the one affected app and that seemed to work. I may find others affected later, but so far it seems to have just been that one.\n\nA: I recently had this issue. It affected all OS on our side including iOS 15 and since I implemented Chromecast on our app, having the app settings for local network permission was super important.\nWe found something that works. In your info.plist, add the key Localizations and add an item. I added French because our app is a French app. This will add the app settings at installation.\n\n\nA: I encountered this (July 2022) while trying to debug an issue with one of our apps on older devices and older iOS versions. On an iPhone 6 running iOS 10.3.3 the rows of non-Apple apps (\"Twitter\", \"Facebook\", etc.) stops after the app \"TV Provider\".\nI deleted all of our own apps from the device, restarted the device, and looked again. ALL the third-party apps now appeared as expected, but within a few seconds they DISAPPEARED again, back to the list stopping at \"TV Provider\".\nMy suspicion is \"TV Provider\" (an Apple app) is the culprit, somehow breaking the process of listing these third-party, non-Apple apps. And when the issue is 'fixed' by other means, \"TV Provider\" recreates the problem.\nI have no advice beyond this observation.\n\nA: Try using the app.  It will ask for permission to use something.  That ask will push it onto the Settings app.\n", "Q: What SSD interface/form factor is compatible with my 13\" MBP (Mid 2012)?

I don't have a computer to use to reset it and when I hold the power and home buttons down it restarts and still asks for the passcode. \nWill hard resetting my phone solve this? If not, what can I do?\n\nA: If you have forgotten your passcode, the only option available to you is to erase your iPhone and start again. Unfortunately, if you haven't got a backup of your data, this will mean you will lose any data you haven't already got saved somewhere. However, on the positive side, any purchases (free and paid) using your Apple ID will still be intact as you can sign in again and redownload them.\nWhile the only option is to erase your iPhone, you do have multiple methods of doing so.

My question is: is the remote disc in this case (OS install) hosted by Apple or is it hosted by some other users' laptops?\n\nA: Remote Disk is a method for sharing another user's CD/DVD drive over your local network, if your own Mac doesn't have an optical drive. It's not a method for installing an OS onto a blank Mac. \nFor that you would use Internet Recovery to reinstall your OS from scratch;\nhold  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   R   at the boot chimes.\nThis will load the image directly from Apple.  \nSee Apple KB: How to reinstall macOS\n", "Q: cannot create a user account on mac using command line I followed the instructions here to create the user jira:\nsudo dscl . create /Users/jira \nsudo dscl . passwd /Users/jira\nsudo dscl . create /Users/jira RealName \"jira user\"\nsudo dscl . create /Users/jira UserShell /bin/bash\nsudo dscl . append /Groups/admin GroupMembership jira\n\nbut I got two problems:\nfirst the user appears as not an admin member although I have added them as an admin (and I have rebooted, see here)\nsecond I cannot make this user own their directory, ie when I run\nsudo chown jira /var/jira\n\nI get\nchown: jira: illegal user name\n\nI cannot login as that user either:\nsu jira\nPassword:\nsu: unknown login: jira\n\nalthough the jira user appears on the list of users:\ndscl . list /Users | grep jira\njira\n\nand \n\n\n\nA: The instructions you're following are rather confused and incomplete; see this ServerFault question for better info. I think the main problem is that you haven't set all of the necessary attributes for the new user (although you've set more than your code fragment suggests!). You're missing:\nsudo dscl . create /Users/jira UniqueID 499   # Use some unique user ID number here; numbers below 500 for hidden accounts\nsudo dscl . create /Users/jira PrimaryGroupID 20   # This is the \"staff\" group; add to admins separately\nsudo dscl . create /Users/jira NFSHomeDirectory /var/jira   # /var is a good place to hide things; regular users go under /Users\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -t user -a jira admin   # This is the RIGHT way to add a secondary group membership\n\nThe problems with your current setup are: the primary group membership of -2 (the \"nobody\" group), the confusion about whether the home directory is /Users/jira or /var/jira (make sure the NFSHomeDirectory points to the actual location! of the directory!), and that you aren't fully setting the membership in the admin group (appending the user's account name to GroupMembership is only part of it; you should also append their GeneratedUID to GroupMembers, or use dseditgroup and let it handle the details).\nEDIT: Kent made a good point that /Users/jira is always the path to the users account in dscl, and might also be the path to the user's home folder in the file system (the NFSHomeDirectory attribute). They're confusingly similar, but don't necessarily have anything to do with each other. In the commands above, I show setting the home folder location to /var/jira instead to hide it. So, to make my example complete, here's how you'd create the home folder:\ncp -R /System/Library/User\\ Template/English.lproj /var/jira\nchown -R jira:staff /var/jira\n\nThese commands create the home folder; the NFSHomeDirectory attribute tells the user where to find it when they log in. It's important that they match.\nOh, and if English isn't the user's primary language, there are a bunch of other user templates to choose from.\n", "Q: How does iOS change file system format during upgrade to iOS 10.3? During upgrade to iOS 10.3, the file system format will change from HFS+ to Apple File System (APFS).\nHow can the process retain the user data when changing file system format (how reliable it is? sounds risky)? Is the process reversible (when I try to downgrade back to iOS 10.2)?\n\nA: It's long been possible to convert one filesystem to another on the fly - Paragon NTFS-HFS Converter is one of many utilities that can handle the task.  \nEquivalent technology could readily be applied to a new disk format - though best guess would be it is a one-way process right now & to revert you would need to wipe & start over.\nI wouldn't dream of doing either without a solid, tested backup in place.\n", "Q: Building boot caches on boot helper partition failed Due to a Hard Drive failure I have had to restore my mac from a backup.

It gets stuck at around 50% of the boot process with the apple logo.\nI have tried the Reinstall macOS procedure under recovery mode, but at the end it prompts the message:\n\nOS X could not be installed on your computer\nBuilding boot caches on boot helper partition failed. Quit the installer to restart your computer\n\nThis happens for both Mavericks as for Sierra.\nWhat can I do to fix this problem? After several, very long attempts, I am desperate to get my data and mac back.\n\n\nA: I have fixed my problem. Before the crash of my hard drive, I was using Yosemite as OS. Apparently you cannot restore a backup made in Yosemite with a bootable USB of either Mavericks or Sierra or with the network restore of Lion.\nI eventually made a bootable USB drive of Yosemite and reinstalled a new copy of Yosemite on my new HDD. After installation I used the Migration Assistant to retrieve my data. This took several hours, but afterwards I could normally reboot my computer. I had tried this same procedure with Lion, Mavericks and Sierra, but that didn't work and the computer wouldn't boot.\nSo if you find yourself having to restore a time machine backup, use a bootable macOS of the same macOS version you were running. \n", "Q: Command + F1 did not shows the more... in IntelliJ IDEA When I view my pom.xml in IntelliJ IDEA, an error is shown:\n\nDependency \"org.springframework:spring-web:4.2.2.RELEASE\" not found   more...

Maybe there's some other setting that I am missing?\n\nA: Try going into Settings > General > Reset > Reset network settings.\nThat will also clear out any remembered WiFi networks so you will have to re-authenticate.

In this case you need to know a bit about how awk works to understand the code. I will focus on describing the awk part, this should get you started in figuring out the rest.\nBasically awk is a pattern-driven scripting language, where commands consist of both a (search) pattern/condition and a corresponding code block. During execution, any input files are read line by line and if the pattern/condition is true for a line, the code block is executed. There are special patterns BEGIN and END which are used to trigger code to get executed before the first line or after the last line is read.\nIn your example you have three pattern/code lines:\nNR==FNR {a[i++]=$0};\n\nNR and FNR are two special variables set by awk. You can look up their meaning with man awk to see that\nNR     ordinal number of the current record\nFNR    ordinal number of the current record in the current file\n\nso basically this condition is true while lines from the first line are read (which means that a[i++]=$0 is executed once for each line from the first file) and false for all additional files. $0 is the current line of input.\n        {b[x++]=$0;};{k=x-i};\n\nThis code block has no condition/pattern so it gets executed for every line read (from all files including the first one).\nEND     {for(j=0;j<i;) print a[j++],b[k++]}' \n\nThis part runs after the last line of the last file has been read and processed.\nWith these basics you should be able to figure out the meaning of the different code blocks and variables yourself.\n", "Q: Connect to printer on Windows PC via smb - authentication required I have laptop with macOS Sierra 10.12 and shared printer Kyocera_FS_1120MFP_GX which is connected to PC with Windows 7. \nIf I connect it directly to my laptop via USB it works, but if I try to connect it via local network it show me Print queue window with Hold for Authentication.\nFor other windows PCs it works ok.\nI tried some commands in terminal:\nlpstat -p shows printer Kyocera_FS_1120MFP_GX is idle.

Then I want these updated contacts to show up in my Android device as well.\n\nA: To sync contacts with your Android phone, you need to make sure that you're adding the contacts to your Gmail account on your iPhone rather than to your iCloud account.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Contacts syncing with your Gmail account by going to Settings -> Mail, Contacts and Calendars -> your Gmail account -> turn on Contacts.\n\n*Turn off Contacts syncing with any other account there.\n\n*Turn off iCloud contacts syncing by going to Settings -> iCloud -> turn off Contacts.\n\n\n\nNow, when you add contacts on your iPhone, they should automatically sync with your Nexus 5X over Google's servers.\nNote: If you lose any contacts you added previously on your iPhone, have no fear, they're still accessible at icloud.com and you can export them as a vCard and open up that file on your iPhone to sync them with your phones as well.\n", "Q: Automator Combine PDF Application I have created almost an exact automator application as those who have posted before me and it goes as follows;\n1) Get Selected Finder Items\n2) Combine PDF pages\n3) Move Finder Items (+show this action when the workflow runs)\nyet when I drop in pdf files into the application icon I get double the pages I initially input. Is there anyone else running into this problem and is there a way around this?\nAnd a related question concerning the naming of output file; what function do I need to add in order to custom name each pdf binder output? As I have read sequential naming doesn't work without a shell script, are there any other solutions which do not involve external scripts other than provided by the automator?\nThank you. \n\nA: If you want to custom name the combined PDF files, then add a Rename Finder Items action between the Combine PDF Pages action and the Move Finder Items action, with the Options set to checking the Show this action when the workflow runs check box. Set the Rename Finder Items action to Name Single Item and Name: Basename only to: [], where [] is and empty text box.\n\nNote: When first added, the Rename Finder Items action shows as Rename Finder Items however, once you select Name Single Item in the first pop-up list box it changes the name of the action to Name Single Item.\nThe reason I suggest setting Name: Basename only to: [] is the .pdf extension is added automatically when the document is saved, so there is no need to type it.\n\nThat said, I was able to reproduce the issue of double pages when using the above workflow as an application See mu Update: note below for the explanation. Another way to do it, without running as a workflow from within Automator, is to create it as an Automator Service workflow as show below:\nThis is then available in Finder from the Finder > Services menu or the Services context menu when selecting PDF files and right-click or control-click the selected files.\n\nUpdate: The cause of the double pages when used as an application with your original actions is because of Application receives files and folders as input, which already receives the selected files and by adding a\nGet Selected Finder Items action it is passing the selected files again and hence double the number of pages. If you want to use it as an application just remove the Get Selected Finder Items action from your original workflow.\n", "Q: Can you prevent iMessage texts from being deleted? Is there any way to prevent the deletion of iMessage history?

Make sure it's set to Forever instead of 30 Days or 1 Year.\n\nA: No, there's no built-in way to archive iMessage history.  \nThe only way to keep messages is to copy/paste them somewhere and then sync that to all your iCloud devices (or to back them up via your preferred archival method).\n\nA: Although not a strict answer to your question, you can archive all messages off-line, including attached images, by using the iExplorer app from Macroplant.

This is why you can use native mini DisplayPort adapters in the Thunderbolt port.\nSo, as far as your two Cinema Displays, you just plug the each of the mini DP plug into each of the Thunderbolt ports and you're done.\n", "Q: Accessing Nokia N900 ssh via USB My MacBook Pro runs El Capitan. I have a Nokia N900 connected via USB. I am trying to access remotely its shell by the ssh protocol. How may I?\n\nA: After some time, I have been able to solve my issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed OpenSSH (server) from Application Manager\n\n*Connected the N900 to the Mac via USB and selected PC-Suite Mode\n\n*On the N900, as root, issued ifup usb0 (activates USB)\n\n*On the N900, as root, issued /etc/init.d/ssh start (starts OpenSSH)\n\n*On the Mac, in Network Preferences (under System Preferences), selected the N900 and configured it manually to have the IP Address 192.168.2.14 and the Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0 (at this point the N900 appears as correctly connected)\n\n*On the Mac, in Terminal, issued ssh root@192.168.2.15\nAt this point a confirmation is requested and I am prompted for the root password. Connection is then established.\nI post all this in the hope of being useful to somebody, maybe with a different device. To be honest I do not understand fully all the passages, especially where I set the IP Address for the N900 as ...14 on the Mac, while by issuing ifconfig on the N900 the reported Address is ...15, and this has to be used in the final ssh command.\nIf anybody has comments which may me help to understand better what I have been doing, I would appreciate that.\n", "Q: How to import Live Photos from Finder to Photos.app? I only use Photos.app as a browser of all my images. \nI unselected the copy items to the Photos library so my files can live in my hard drive and I don't duplicate them inside the Photos Library.photoslibrary archive. \nI use Image Capture to import the iPhone pictures to a folder and after I used to imported to Photos.app and everything was great. \nBut now with Live photos I get two files for each picture, the picture and the little movie that makes the Live part possible. The problem is that if I try to import them to Photos.app, it doesn't recognise them. \nIs there any way to import the picture with the Live functionality to the app without duplicating the content?\n\nA: You have to import the two files of the same picture (the photo and the video) with the same name. \nPhotos will recognise them as a live picture then. \n\nA: Which version of macOS are you using? This is supposed to work on Sierra.\nI cannot test this because my iPhone cannot take Live Photos. Try to download the photos from your iPhone by connecting it to a USB port of your Mac and importing directly to Photos.\nThe safest way to transfer Live Photos is to use iCloud Photo Library and let the Mac sync with iCloud.\n", "Q: How did a user manage to get my multi-window app to run in \"Tabbed Windows Mode\"? Today one of my users sent me some screenshots showing my application running in \"Tabbed Windows\" mode, i.e. with all the usually-separate windows showing up as tabs inside a single window, like this:\n\nThis is very cool, especially since I never actually programmed in any support for a \"tabbed windows mode\" in an application.  :)\nUnfortunately the user doesn't know how he got the application into this mode, and I can't figure out how to do it either.\nWhen I Google the subject, I find articles like this one describing how this mode was added to some of Apple's own apps, and how MacOS/X will automatically added to any third-party apps that are \"document-based\"; for those apps, some additional menu items (like \"Merge All Windows\" and \"Show Previous/Next Tab\" and \"Move Tab To New Window\") will get automatically inserted into the Window menu.\nHowever, my app isn't \"document-based\" AFAIK (it's a cross-platform app based on Qt5.4.1), and it doesn't have any menu named \"Window\".  (It does have a menu named \"Windows\", but those menu items do not show up in that menu)\nDoes anyone know how my user pulled off this trick?\n\nA: Just wondering what version of macOS you're running? The other user must be using macOS Sierra, what about you?\nIn macOS Sierra tabs are supported in any application where it’s possible to have multiple windows open. Based on your description, your app supports multiple simultaneous windows. \nAssuming you have macOS Sierra installed, you can activate this in the way you found through your Google search. But if you haven't, then you won't be able to get tabbed windows to work.\nIf you do have the latest version of macOS Sierra installed, update your question and let me know.

Here's the entires I see:\nCPU: \n\nEnergy:\n\nMemory: \n\nDoes anybody know if an anti-virus is usually a power hog? Is there anything I can do about it?\n\nA: Yes, AV is a battery hog.\nYou are looking at three different processes, actually. The first is SophosServiceManager, which looks like the process that is actually doing the scan.  It looks like it's taking tons of CPU (and thus battery).\nSophosUIServer probably just displays the little icon in the menu bar, and takes almost no memory.\nSophosScanD is yet a third process.\n", "Q: Can you undo close all Finder windows (alt + click the red close button)?

If you enter it on the iOS side, it will then be correctly displayed on the macOS side. That is, on iOS I can enter a calendar item for (say) a flight across time zones, using local airport times.

I'm using FluidApp Version 1.8.6 (2331) on MacOS Sierra 10.12.3. Sometimes I need to copy current URL of Web page in FluidApp. I want to do it with keyboard shortcut and I know I need to use a service for it.\nSo how do I create a service for this job?\n\nA: If you're having issues using ⌘L, ⌘C and Esc and you want an AppleScript script that runs as an Automator Service, in order to copy the URL of a Fluid App, created with Fluid, then here is an example scenario you could implement.\nUnder macOS 10.12.3 using Fluid (Version 1.8.6 (206)) and the URL of this question, I created a Fluid App named Ask Different Question.\n\nI them made an Automator Service workflow using a Run AppleScript action and the AppleScript code below.\nset appName to \"Ask Different Question\"\n\ntell application appName\n    activate\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set toolbarState to (name of every menu item of menu 1 of menu bar item 5 of menu bar 1 of application process appName)\n        if toolbarState contains \"Show Toolbar\" then\n            keystroke \"t\" using {option down, command down}\n            set the clipboard to (get value of text field 1 of group 1 of toolbar 1 of window 1 of application process appName)\n            keystroke \"t\" using {option down, command down}\n        else\n            set the clipboard to (get value of text field 1 of group 1 of toolbar 1 of window 1 of application process appName)\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that all you should have to change in the code above is the first line, set appName to ... where ... is the name of your Fluid App. The rest of the code should then work as is.\n\n\nIn Automator, create a new Service workflow, adding a Run AppleScript action to it. Then replace the default code with the code above. Also change the value for Service receives to no input while selecting the target Fluid App for in, as shown in the image below. Then save the Automator Service workflow.\n\nThe next step is to assign a keyboard shortcut for the Automator Service workflow you've just created.\nIn System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, find your service and set its shortcut.\nI used ⌘U as that was easy to remember using U for URL.\n\nThe last thing you'll need to do, is add the Fluid App you created that will use the Automator Service workflow you've just created to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility as shown in the image below for the Ask Different Question app I created in Fluid.\n\nNow when you're in the Fluid App you created and press ⌘U, the URL will be copied to the Clipboard and from there you can paste it wherever you'd like.\n\nA: Developer of Fluid here. I don't know much about Services, but in Fluid you can copy the current URL using keyboard shortcuts, but it requires two:\n⌘L - to temporarily show and select the text of the URL location text field at the top.\n⌘C - to copy the selected text.\nEsc - to dismiss the toolbar at the top.\n", "Q: App Store Update cannot change account I am on MacOS Sierra 10.12.3. I have several updates pending in the App Store app. When I try to load them, I get asked to log in. However, the e-mail address that is pre-populated and not editable is an old one that I do not use anymore as my Apple ID. I have a new Apple ID and I am even logged in with that one on the store. \nWhat happened is that I setup this machine using a backup which still had the old Apple ID. For several reasons, I could not log in to the old Apple ID account anymore and created a new one. It seems my machine cannot forget about the old one. I deleted it in the accounts system preferences already.\nEven when I log out of the App Store app, it still asks for the password for my old ID. Is there any cache file which I can delete to completely remove the old one?\n\nA: There is no way round this.\nThe apps (& even the OS itself) belong to the Apple ID, not the 'computer' or even the 'human' operating it. \nYou would do better to try get the old account back into shape - start at https://iforgot.apple.com -  then set up Family Sharing  which would then allow both accounts access to the full purchase history.\n", "Q: Which cable to use from iMac 5k to 30 inch Dell monitor?

However, there is a quicker way to be able to resume playing, You can swipe up from the bottom of the lock screen, and get access to the play / pause controller. You do not need to authenticate to do this.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Will the Lightning to USB 3 adapter let me connect via Xcode for debugging via the power passthrough? I see that the Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter has two 'inputs', the usb port and an additional Lightning port. From anecdotal evidence (I have found no official manual) it is for power supply. Nice, but. Can I use this port to connect to computer, for Xcode debugging purposes, while using the Camera Adapter for connecting a MIDI device at the same time? \nThanks.\n\nA: No, it is not possible.

Actually I have sold my MacBook Pro and before doing that, I did rm -rf * in home directory and then in Disk Utility I erased both the disk options then I was not able to boot again , when restarted it came up with a flashing question mark sign. \nMy question is that can I be sure that all my pictures files and in Photos app have been deleted or not?\n\nA: The Photos app normally uses photos that are stored in the Pictures folder inside of your home directory, although you can change the location that the app looks for and stores photos in.\nrm -rf *  means delete all files and folders in the current directory without warning me that I might be deleting something important or asking if I'm sure.\nSo this would have deleted the photos in the current folder.  It would also delete things like your user Library and all the settings for your user account, which can make the account unusable.\nUsing disk utility to reformat the hard drive erases the entire computer, operating system and all.  \nTo answer your question, unless someone used some kind of forensic tools to take apart your hard drive, your photos are gone.\n", "Q: Turn off WiFi if there is no user initiated network access I'd like to limit my exposure to the WiFi signal of my laptop while it is sitting on my belly or lower while being in bed.\nIs there a way to auto-turn off the WiFi directly after a website has finished loading? And to only turn it back on when I click another link?\n\nA: This is neither practical nor feasible.\nNot practical.\nSo, in your scenario, the WiFi connection drops as soon as you load your webpage and theoretically, the computer is now waiting for you to click on something to reconnect.  Here are just two (off the top of my head) problems with that scenario:\nAuto Refresh\nA small piece of code embedded within the meta tags of the HTML code will auto refresh that page:\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"5\" >\n\nThis is equivalent to hitting refresh.  How is the OS supposed to distinguish between a user generated refresh and one generated in meta?  That's a lot of keyboard trapping.\nHTTP Sessions.  Depending on the website you visit, they may be employing the use of cookies that track user sessions - especially so if you log in.  Once you disconnect from the network, your session will expire requiring a new login.  There is no \"trapping\" on the client side for this because it's a server generated session/cookie.\n\nNot feasible.\nFor all intents and purposes your network settings and your browser session are \"sandboxed\" from each other.  Could you imagine the chaos you could cause by having an app or (worse) a browser's extension with the ability to affect the state of hardware based on what you click?  This would be an attacker's dream scenario.\nAdditionally, WiFi (and Bluetooth) antennas are in the LCD enclosure, not the bottom of the laptop.  So, unless you are wearing shorts made of lead or lined with a highly reflective material (reflecting out, of course), you are fully exposed to WiFi signals since they are omni directional.\n\nA: Use e.g. Icefloor to configure your computer to allow ports 80 and 443 only to block all non-http traffic. Disable javascript and flash etc. in the browser. This will result a behaviour very close to the one you desire. The amount of energy that is transmitted if your wlan is idle is minimal, and you shouldn't worry about that. Actually, establishing a connecion each time you click would put more energy into your abdomen. You may additionally want to use a browser that allows you to disable auto-refresh like e.g. firefox.\n", "Q: imagemagick's convert jpeg to pdf rotates even pages 180° When I use imagemagick's convert jpeg to pdf tool:\nconvert *.jpeg output.pdf\n\nan output PDF is created, but what I've noticed is that the even pages get rotated by 180°.\nWhat's even stranger is that if I open the even pages with Preview, rotate them 90° right and then rotate them 90° left, and then save it and run the convert command again, the page doesn't get rotated 180°.\nIs there anything I'm doing wrong over here?\n\nA: It seems like the scanner I used to scan the documents I was trying to make PDFs of was saving the images with an orientation property. These were the two properties:\nOrientation: 1 (Normal)\nOrientation: 3 (Rotated 180°)\nSo, although it looked as though the images were upright, every second image would technically be flipped 180°, which is the property that imagemagick would use. \nRemoving this property from multiple images should be possible on macOS using a tool like ExifTool.\n", "Q: iPhone makes shutter sound when taking photos despite being on mute I recently purchased a refurbished iPhone 6. It's been set up from my old device's iCloud backup and updated to iOS 10.2.1. \nUnfortunately, despite being set to silent via the physical mute switch, my iPhone will make a shutter sound whenever I take a photo using the built in camera. I'm using my device in the United States, so country laws shouldn't be an issue.\nWhy would an iPhone camera be making a shutter sound while set to silent?\nEdit: Worth noting that using the mute switch worked for my last iPhone\n\nA: It is possible the refurbished unit originated from Japan or Korea, where the setting of the mute switch is deliberately ignored by the Camera app. See this article at engadget. \n\nA: According to this article about turning off the shutter sound:\n\nFor those in the United States, turning off the camera sound is illegal, as the law states that cell phones containing digital cameras must make a sound when taking a picture.\n\nYou should be able to turn the sound off by pressing the volume down button all the way until it goes into vibrate mode.  It looks like you could have done that already.  \nAt this point, your options are\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a 3rd-party camera app that allows you to control the shutter sound.\n\n*Use Assistive Touch to disable the sound prior to taking a picture.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> Accessibility\n\n*Scroll to the bottom and select Accessibility Shortcut -> AssistiveTouch.  \n\n*Back-out of that menu item so you're in Accessibility again.  Scroll up and select AssistiveTouch and turn it on.  \n\n*Enter Customize Top Level Menu and remove icons until there's only one left. Tap that icon and select Mute (if you leave two or more icons here it will not work).\n\n\n\nAccording to that site:\n\nWhen you triple-click the home button, a small floating AssistiveTouch button will appear on the screen. When you press it, the system sound will be muted completely, including the camera shutter sound and alarm. Pressing the AssistiveTouch button again will re-enable the system sound, and triple-clicking the home button will hide the AssistiveTouch button.\n\n\nA: You can use camera app B612 to take photo without sound. Because in B612 have option to mute sound camera.\n", "Q: Xcode cannot download iOS 10 simulator due to network connection issue I am having trouble downloading an iOS 10.x Simulator on Xcode.

Just wondering if I could charge my 12inch macbook with the type-c adopter that came with the Nintendo switch \nhttps://store.nintendo.co.uk/nintendo-switch-accessory/nintendo-switch-power-adapter/11396099.html \n\nA: I have tested on the 2015 MacBook 12\". Works perfectly. Charges at 15.3V @ 1,9A = 28,7W. The MacBook 12\" charger also works on the Switch.\nUSB-C and recent USB Power Delivery standards make this a fairly safe bet in terms of cross platform interoperability. As long as the charger or cable aren't knockoff, you should expect reasonable results mixing vendors. \nReasonable is a 15 inch MacBook Pro clearly won't run and charge from a 30 watt adapter (whether Apple or Nintendo), but if powered off, it will slowly and safely charge itself at the rate the connected adapter provides. \n\nA: Just an important pointer for anyone considering to charge their switch with non nintendo chargers!! Watch out, using the non-nintendo certified chargers have a real chance of completely bricking your device. \nThe switch charging standard is not completely the same and using a different charger could render your switch useless. \nMore information:\nhttps://bgr.com/2018/04/06/nintendo-switch-charging-cables-warning-bricked/\n", "Q: How to change Safari HTTP header Accept-Language?

Make sure you know how to switch back to your normal language!\n\nThat is very inconvenient. \nIs there a way to do the same with Safari, to simulate a different language/location, for example for web development purposes?\n\nA: One way to set the language for Safari without changing the language for the entire system, is to go into System Preferences > Language & Region > Apps. Here you can add a new entry to customise the language for Safari only.\n\nA: You can change the language of any website in any browser(Safari, Chrome, Firefox..) by creating a Modify Headers rule in Requestly\n\nThis will add the header Accept-Language in Safari for the URLs present in the rule. This is instantly reflected in your browser without changing any System Preferences\nDisclaimer: I work at Requestly\n", "Q: AppleScript: Is it possible to have an unselected \"default answer\" in an input dialog? When one uses the default answer parameter in display dialog in AppleScript, whatever text is set to default answer is automatically highlighted upon display of the dialog.\nIs it possible to specify a default answer without the answer highlighted?\nI would ideally like the cursor to be placed after the last character of the default answer, so that the user can append text to this answer without first pressing the → key (or, worse, accidentally overwriting the default answer).\n\nA: I figured it out.\nIf one presses the right arrow key just milliseconds before the dialog is displayed, then the default answer will not be selected and the blinking cursor will be placed after the default text.\nYou can perform this action in AppleScript like so:\n-- Unselect the “default answer” in an input dialog:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 124 -- right arrow key\nend tell\n\ndisplay dialog \"Enter a keyword:\" default answer \"I do not want this text to be highlighted. \"\n\nIn theory, the above solution should not work. In theory, the key press should commence and complete before the display dialog command initiates. But, this method does work, for whatever reason.\n\nNote: This method will not work if you insert key code 124 before the very first dialog of your AppleScript file. In this case, my above code will fail to behave as desired and the default answer text will remain selected. (It may misleadingly appear to work correctly if you are simply running the AppleScript code from within Script Editor.app or Automator.app, but it will not work correctly if you run the .scpt file via Fast Scripts, osascript in Terminal.app, or any other method.)\nHowever, if the display dialog in question is the second, third, or fiftieth dialog in an AppleScript file, my solution works correctly. Don't ask me why it won't work on the first dialog (because I don't know).\nSo, you have no choice but to rearrange the dialogs of the AppleScript file so that the first dialog does not need to have a default answer.\nOne workaround, if your initial dialog must have a default answer that is unselected, is to insert a dialog that automatically proceeds after a brief amount of time has elapsed. This dialog should be inserted immediately before the above tell block. It's not an elegant solution, but here is some code that will work:\ndisplay alert \"Please wait...\" message \"...\" buttons (\"\") giving up after 1\n-- I think that \"1\" is the minimum for \"giving up after.\" I tried \"0.5\" and the dialog completely stalled.\n\n\nAs long as it does not precede the initial dialog of a script, I have personally found my method to be reliable; it works 100% of the time on my computer.\n", "Q: Single Key Macro for OS X I want to make a simple macro for a game I play but can't figure out how through mac programs. I'm looking to run a macro where when I press x, it outputs as pressing the x key twice in a row very fast (.5milliseconds).\nBasically turning x into xx, but having the output very fast\n\nA: I suggest you try Karabiner Elements where you can do what you want (but I don't know HOW fast).\nYou'd have to import a VERY simple \"Complex Modification\" to press two key presses in a row.\nSomething like this:\n{\"title\": \"Make single letter click twice FAST …\",\n \"rules\": [\n        { \"description\": \"Press 'x' twice.\",\n         \"manipulators\": [\n           \"conditions\":[{\"bundle_identifiers\": [ \"^com.game.name\" ],\n                                        \"type\": \"frontmost_application_if\" }\n                         ],\n                 \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"x\",\n                          \"modifiers\": { \"optional\": [\"any\"] }\n                         },\n                   \"to\": [\n                          { \"key_code\": \"x\" }, { \"key_code\": \"x\" } ],\n                 \"type\": \"basic\"\n} ] } ] }\n\nKarabiner comes with \"EventViewer\" which will tell you in its tab \"frontmost application\" what name it expects (keep \"^\" !).\n(HERE is an example which explains the importing into K-Elements.)\n", "Q: Where has iTunes \"Summary\" gone On iTunes 12.5.3 on my Mac there is an option to \"Encrypt local backup\".\nMy wife has just bought a new iPad, but when she tried to backup the old iPad there seemed to be no similar option (on iTunes 12.5.5). There doesn't even to seem to be a \"Summary\" item under the iPod.\nHow do you set \"Encrypt local backup\" and/or change passwords.\n\nA: Yes, both the Summary and encrypt local backup options are available.\nTo view the Summary\nBefore you can view the summary of any device, you first need to connect it via cable to your Mac and have iTunes running. Once you've done this, if your Sidebar is visible, your device will appear in the list (which is probably where you've been looking). However, this is not where you can access the Summary from. \nInstead, near the top left where the drop-down menu is to select from Music, Movies, etc you will now see on the right of it a device icon. Click on that to view the Summary for the connected device.\nEncrypt backup\nOnce you've got the Summary up (as per above) you will see a Backups section in the centre of the screen. It is from there you can enable the encrypt backup option.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have 2 different backup systems for different external hard drives? 1) I want to plug in an external hard drive and then download all of the photographs that I take in RAW format on my Canon 7D camera onto this external hard drive, and then backup these photos onto a second external hard drive. These photos would NOT be held on my MacBook Pro. \n2) I then want to backup everything on my MacBook Pro to an external hard drive (but NOT the same external hard drive as the one the RAW photos will be held on).\nSo is it possible please to set up these two different systems? At the moment I use Time Machine to backup everything on my MacBook Pro - but I need to have two  different systems as I outlined above- can Time machine be setup for this or is there a different way to do it? Any help would be gratefully received. Thanks\n\nA: Yes, Time Machine can do this. All you need to do is connect at least two hard drives to your Mac. One hard drive will be for you to download your raw photos on to manually as you wish. The other hard drive will be your TM hard drive. Because your first HD for your photos is connected to your Mac, it wil also be backed up whenever TM does a backup. Those TM backups will backup what's on your Mac and what's on your photos HD, but you also have the option to select anything you want to exclude from the backup by going into the Options on TM.\n", "Q: system-wide password manager in iOS and OS X I'm booting up my AWS app in iOS and I'd like iOS to give me a stored password. Ideally I'd like it to be generated.

This is not cheap, but does regularly go on sale for much discounted prices.\n1Password will do everything you want and more. It works across iOS, macOS, Android and Windows. You can watch a video highlighting its features. And, you can also try it out for free.\nAnd of course, it offers extensions for Safari, FireFox, etc. You can also download it directly via the Mac and iOS App Stores.\nDisclaimer: I have no affiliation with 1Password whatsoever.\n", "Q: Can I change Calendar Event details with AppleScript? I am a seasoned developer, but very new to AppleScript.\nI would like to change some of the details of an event in a calendar.\nI have found the Library in the Script Editor, and made my way to the Calendar section. I’m not at all sure where to go from here.\nIn particular, I would like to change a detail which is not listed in the Library, so I’m not altogether optimistic.

If I have several OS X Services set up for \"Text,\" is it possible to organize them within custom-titled menus, within my systemwide selected-text context menu?\n\nA: There is no API to perform this currently.\n\n*\n\n*Items in the Services Menu\n\nThe items in the Services menu are commands categorized by what type of data they operate on. The application icon of the application providing a service appears to the left of the service’s name in the menu. If two or more applications provide a service with an identical name, the name of the application providing each one is appended in parentheses after the name of the service in the menu.\nThe Services menu is populated when the menu is opened.\n\nI suppose you could hack the OS (assuming SIP is not enabled) to add that functionality, but it's not something that's publicly available or documented widely that a private API exists to do what you ask.\n", "Q: I modified the 'com.apple.screencapture.plist' file and now my screenshots don't save In Terminal, I executed the following lines:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nBut try as I might, my screenshots never save to the Desktop. In fact, I have no idea where they go!\nHere's a GIF demonstrating the problem:\n\nHere's a screenshot of my keyboard settings (to show that there are no conflicts or that I'm not accidentally copying to clipboard):\n\nDoes anyone have an idea?\n\nA: Assuming that you are running the latest version of macOS, with iCloud Drive activated and the \"Desktop & Documents Folders\" option selected, the ~/Desktop is no longer your regular desktop folder, as it's synchronized with iCloud. \nMy suggestion: drag any file from your desktop to a terminal window, and it will show the full path for the file in the desktop folder. \nHope it helps.\n\nA: You can revert the screenshot save location to default (desktop) by removing the location key in the plist file. Just use the following Terminal command:\ndefaults delete com.apple.screencapture location; killall SystemUIServer\nIf that doesn't solve the issue, then there might be another aspect of your plist file that is corrupt, or another issue is present. As an alternative, you can just trash your current plist file completely and then reapply any adjustments to the defaults that you desire.\n\nA: The problem you are having is that the OS doesn't understand the ~ shortcut. That's only a shell shortcut.\nSet the location to the absolute path:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/<username>/Desktop/\n(replacing <username> with your username)\nThis should fix your problem.\n\nA: Just pointing out that \"Terminal and bash... are a part of the overall OS\" has zero to do with it.  Shell expansions happen before command execution, so the defaults binary never sees the tilde, that's all.\nI'm not where I can check, but I wonder if it's more that you have the trailing slash on it for some reason?\nLastly... don't they default to the desktop anyway?\n", "Q: Is there any metadata stored in Contacts.app contacts that would store when a contact was created or last edited? I'd like to view my contacts in order of last added in order to remember a few people who's names I now forget but meet this year when busy. The standard Select All… Copy… Paste into numbers as provided here doesn't have fields for record creation date and record edit date. \nWondering if an Applescript or other tool on macOS would make it possible to get this data along with contact data?\n\nA: You can use AppleScript to get the creation date and modification date of any contact in the Contacts app. Here is an example script that works on the entire Contacts file. At the end, you have a tab-delimited result called \"the_text\" which you can copy and paste into Numbers or Excel or whatever.\nset the_text to \"\"\n--\ntell application \"Contacts\"\n    set the_contacts to every person\n    repeat with a_contact in the_contacts\n        tell a_contact\n            set the_name to name\n            set long_creation_date to creation date\n            set creation_date to short date string of long_creation_date\n            set long_modification_date to modification date\n            set modification_date to short date string of long_modification_date\n            set the_text to the_text & return & the_name & tab & creation_date & tab & modification_date\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nreturn the_text\n\nThe creation date of a contact is the full date, with time. So is the modification date. They look like this:\n\"Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 2:11:34 PM\"\nBy asking for the \"short date string\" of those dates we get dates that look like this:\n\"7/6/17\"\nThat format may be more useful for you for sorting purposes than the full long date with time.\n", "Q: Stiff trackpad on Macbook air I just got a used Early 2015 Macbook Air. I got it a bit cheap, due to the trackpad being stiff.\nBasically when I first open it, it registers all clicks, although I need to press somewhat hard. But if I click on it about 50 times, it starts to loosen up a bit, and act more like a normal trackpad would. However, if I then leave it for an hour, it is back to being stiff again.\nWhat could the problem be, and is it fixable?\nThe rest of the computer works perfectly fine.\nThank you.\n\nA: Your trackpad is most likely bad.  It's not unheard of, after all, it is a mechanical device to some extent.\nIt could be either it's just worn out or there may have been some sort of liquid spill like juice that is causing it to become \"sticky\" (I personally repaired this condition). \nThere is the possibility that the battery may be swollen (you may have to examine it when the back cover is off; even remove the battery).  If that's the case, you will also want to replace the battery.  I recommend getting one with at least an 18 month warranty.   \nYou can get a replacement trackpad fairly inexpensively, but it will take some effort - you will have to remove the battery.  Ifixit.com has an excellent step-by-step guide to walk you through.\nAs you can see in the pictures, once you have the back cover off, you can gain access to the battery.  After you remove the battery, you then have access to the trackpad.\n\n\nThis is not a difficult repair, but detail oriented.  If you take your time, you should be able to accomplish this.  If not, any reputable repair shop can tackle this for you.\n\nA: My advice if you can still move the cursor is to enable tap to click under settings.\n\n", "Q: How does photos app in mac imports pictures from hard disk? I copied some pictures in my mac from my phone using a usb. But in photos app some of them are being shown and some not shown. Some of them I have deleted are being shown and some are not being shown after deletion from finder as jpeg files. My question is how does photos app work?\n\nA: The Photos app works by creating a library of your photos files.   A regular library has two important parts, the books on the shelves and some kind of cataloging system to help you to find the book that you are looking for.  If you brought a cookbook that you bought into a real library, other library patrons wouldn't be looking at your cookbook because it is not a part of the library's collection.\nIn the same way, if you copy pictures onto the hard drive of your computer, but do not tell the Photos app about them, then they are not considered a part of the Photos library.\nThere are several ways to import photos into the Photos App.  Photo's usually opens when you connect a phone, for example and will attempt to import photos that way.  If you have a folder with pictures though,  you can either drag that into the window of the Photos app or from the Menu Bar with Photos open click File>Import.

The headphones can then be connected in the midst of the conversation and work fine.\nI'm guessing I need to reset my phone. But since I would immediately have to recreate my settings from an iTunes backup – would it actually solve any problems? \n\nA: You absolutely will want to do some tests or work with AppleCare / support on this.

Depending on whether your MacBook is an early or late 2011, it may not be equipped to do internet recovery  by starting it with CMD-OPT-R.   If CMD-OPT-R does not begin internet recovery, then you need either a USB installer, a Snow Leopard DVD disk, or to take it to an Apple Store for them to install an operating system on your MacBook, which they'll usually do for free.\n", "Q: 2016 MacBook Pro shutdowns when the lid is close with cause 0 My 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro is now experiencing shutdowns when the lid is closed. Though it is not a crash because I don't get a crash report when I turn the computer back on (unlike the problem I had earlier). I used the following Terminal command to obtain the Previous Shutdown Cause (as the console app can't do it anymore in Sierra):\nlog show --style syslog --last 48h | egrep shutdown\\ cause | awk -F')' '{print substr($0,1,19), $NF}'\n\nThe code for the shutdown is 0. From this question I found that 0 triggers when you unplugged the battery, or the power cable on desktop Macs. But the battery on the 2016 MacBook Pro is non-removable (obviously). Even more strangely, when this happens, my laptop is plugged into the power adapter and for sure it is charging. This doesn't happen when I am using the computer both on battery and power adapter, it only happens when the lid is closed for a while.\nI have tried to reset SMC and NVRAM with no luck. Anyone know how to solve this problem?\n\nA: Possible hardware issues aside, check what is your setting on what the computer wants to do when you close the lid and the behaviour afterwards. You can see the settings with the:\npmset -g\n\nLook for the hibernatemode, autopoweroffdelay and standbydelay settings.\nSee a blog post describing the pmset settings here\nOn the hardware problems side I've read reports that a faulty charger might cause the MacBook to shutdown. As you report that the problem does not occur when on battery life, this may be the culprit and I'd suggest you try a different charger.\nIs the time you mention \"for a while\" three hours or more? Then the problem occurs when your MacBook tries to enter the standby (see standbydelay setting above).\n\nA: It had been close to year after posting this original question. The MacBook is completely fine now. It has to be some bugs that Apple had in the 2016 revision of the MBP. I’ve been running for a close to half a year without any problem now (it hadn’t even crashed once after 10.13). If you still had the same question you might want to get the machine serviced as I’m pretty sure if it’s that then it’s a logic board problem. \n", "Q: mac OS microphone only works when using Siri, works fine on bootcamp As the title says the mic only works in Mac OS when using Siri in any other application it is just muted, the input level in system setting is always 0 as shown in the picture unless I'm using Siri.

She somehow managed to ignore my advice to apply a passcode. We put the phone into \"erase mode\" right after we noticed it was gone. \nTheoretically speaking, what info does the thief have access to? I know the phone will enter erase mode as soon as it connects to a network, but assuming it doesn't, and assuming the thief does not elect to wipe it himself, what kind of information can he access? \n\nA: First, be sure to go to this Apple Support page and follow the instruction for what to do if your iOS device is lost or stolen.  Your options will be limited, as will your ability to control the 'damage' the person with the iPhone can do, because it wasn't protected.\n\nWhat if your device is off or offline?\nIf your missing device is off or offline, you can still put it in Lost Mode, lock it, or remotely erase it. The next time your device is online, these actions will take effect. If you remove the device from your account while it's offline, any pending actions for the device will be cancelled.\n\nThe thief can simply not allow the iPhone to access the internet and then do whatever they want with the data on it.  They will have access to any app that's not password/passcode/fingerprint protected.\nI would recommend you change the password, ASAP, for any app/site that is accessible on the iPhone.\n", "Q: Safari doesn't load Kickstarter properly?

You can test for that by taking your Mac to another network (coffee shop, public library, another country (not China or North Korea for instance).\n\n*JavaScript blockers could cause this. Disabling JavaScript does change the rendering of Kickstarter for me, but the breakage is far less than what you report. Yours looks like the CSS isn't even loading.\n\n*Check for CSS changes/overrides you have made to your browser or system.\n\n*Web Privacy plug in (or network level controls) could cause this.\n\n*Bad settings on your user account could cause this. To test that, make a brand new user account.\n\n\nFrom your testing on Chrome vs Safari - it's highly likely you have a hostile network and/or software on your Mac that's rewriting the web content being served to you and breaking it.\n\nA: The error \"NET::ERR_CERT_REVOKED\" indicates that one of the certificates in the certificate chain was revoked. The kickstarter site works for other users here though.\nEither the kickstarter (*c.ssl.fastly.net) or the root/intermediate certificate (Global Sign Root/Global Sign CloudSSL CA) was revoked erroneously or temporarily. The revocation is still stored in your ocsp/crl cache.\nAfter deleting the caches the chain of certificates (and https://kickstarter.com) should work again:\nin 10.11 or older open Terminal and execute:\nsudo rm /var/db/crls/*cache.db\n\nin 10.12 (Sierra) use this command instead:\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Keychains/*/ocspcache.sqlite3 'DELETE FROM ocsp;'\n\nAfter deleting the cache reboot your Mac.\n\nProbably related: NET::ERR_CERT_REVOKED in Chrome, when the certificate is not actually revoked\n", "Q: Thunderbolt to USB 3 adapter I have a thunderbolt to usb 3 adapter & it is plugged into the thunderbolt port.

It works fine, but my question is, in Network in system preferences shows the ac wifi adapter as connected but the thunderbolt port shows inactive. Confused about this.\nMacBook Pro 17\" early 2011 - Sierra.\nThanks\n\nA: That makes sense. The USB adapter has a driver and is active.\nThunderbolt isn't getting a network address since you don't have a direct network on that port. You would have an active connection if you went thunderbolt to thunderbolt on another Mac or PC or a direct thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet adapter.\nDon't over think the network pane - as long as the end device is listed, you are good to go without worrying about what's between it and the CPU.\n\nA: The Network Preferences Pane shows network location settings.  If your Thunderbolt port isn't being used as a network location (connecting to other computers or the internet) then it's inactive.  I have a Thunderbolt to ethernet adapter connected, so it says Thunderbolt Ethernet connected.  If I had Thunderbolt to another computer connected the Thunderbolt Bridge location would show as connected.\nThe only time you really need to pay attention to this is if your Thunderbolt connection is not working.  It's possible that the network location for that service is missing or misconfigured and needs to be recreated.\n\nA: Thanks so much bmike & Aaron Paul for your answers & explanations.

Where did it go? I have limited MB's on my internet connection , so I don't want to download it again!\n\nA: You'll have to download it again because it's gone! The OS X Installer application bundle is automatically deleted when the install is finished, when it's executed from a running occurrence of the OS.  In other words, when doing an in-place upgrade, one needs to first make a copy of the installer if needed to be used again.\nAs an example, when the Install OS X El Capitan.app was downloaded, it's saved in the Applications folder and a copy of it needs to be made, preferably to another location, first before proceeding with the upgrade.\nNote that if you've been using Time Machine, there may be a copy of the Installer application bundle in the backup, however, timing is everything. That is to say, because of the size of the installer and the time of the last backup in conjunction with when the installer was downloaded and used to preform the upgrade, there is the possibility that the copy of the Installer application bundle is not a complete copy.\n", "Q: Mirroring Issues with Apple TV My Apple TV is connected with Wifi and all my devices can connect using airplay but as soon as i plug in my network cable i cant mirror my MacBook Pro or the iPhone. On the apple tv it shows that cable is connected and internet works fine using the cable but airplay doesn't work. \nCan someone please advise on how to set this up?\n\nA: Your question doesn't explain why you're wanting to connect the Apple TV via Ethernet, but your Apple TV and the devices you want to be able to airplay to it need to be on the same network. It seems to me that the act of plugging in the Ethernet cable is changing the network it's connected to.\nIf the Wi-Fi network and Ethernet cable are all connected via the same router you should be okay, but that could depend on the actual router (but most modern routers should be fine).\nYou need to determine if in fact they are on the same network. So, the questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*where does the Ethernet cable go to?\n\n*is it plugged into the same Wi-Fi router or into something else? \n\n\nAnother potential issue is if you're using a VPN. For example, I've seen users with a Wi-Fi network that all devices are connected to except for an iMac and the Apple TV. Instead, the iMac is connected via Ethernet to an Ethernet Wireless adaptor (so they're connecting their Mac to the Wi-Fi network via an Ethernet cable) and then they use that connection to connect to a VPN. Once connected they share their Ethernet connection via the Mac's Wi-Fi and then connect their Apple TV to the iMac's Wi-Fi network.\nWhile all devices in the above scenario actually connect to the internet via the same original Wi-Fi network, as far as the setup is concerned they're different connections. So for a device to airplay to an Apple TV in the above scenario they also need to connect to the Mac's Wi-Fi network, because that's the one the Apple TV is connected to.\nHopefully this info will shed some light on what's going on with your setup.\nLet me know how you go. More than happy to help you troubleshoot this.\n", "Q: Using regex in Mac OS X: why I have to add \\ in {3, 5} ==> \\{3, 5\\} ...? I am trying to find all files with no-extension in a particular folder, and after many attempts I finally came up with this regex statement:\n\nls | grep \"\\.[A-Za-z]\\{3,5\\}$\"\n\nWhy I have to start the occurrences around the {} with \\, like escaping the sequence? Is there a way to use standard regex like this?\n\nls | grep \"\\.[A-Za-z]{3,5}$\"\n\nI want, ultimately to get the opposite list of files with no-extension, but this non standard regex is making it hard for me to negate the result from the grep.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you do not need to escape the curly-braces with a backslash if you form the command properly.\nIn other words, when using a RegRx with grep, let it know the search pattern is a RegEx by using the -E option.\nIf you want an inverse match then use the -v option as well.\nExample:\nls | grep -E -v '\\.[A-Za-z]{0,5}$'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note I used {0,5}$ instead of {3,5}$ to account for any extension up to 5 characters. If you want to include files that might have a 1 or 2 character extensions, then use {3,5}$ instead.\n\n\nYou can also use the following example:\nls | grep -E -v '\\.[[:alpha:]]{0,5}$'\n\nSometimes a file extension can have numbers in them, so to account for that, use as an example:\nls | grep -E -v '\\.[A-Za-z0-9]{0,5}$'\n\nOr:\nls | grep -E -v '\\.[[:alnum:]]{0,5}$'\n\nNote: Some commands require the options to be passed individually, while others can be combined. In this case, grep does allow options to be concatenated. So in the example commands, -E -v can be expressed as -Ev or -vE, if you wish.\n\nA: If your shell is ksh then you could list files in the current directory without an extension like this:\nprintf '%s\\n' !(*.*)\n\nBash supports ksh extended globs when you enable them:\nshopt -s extglob\nprintf '%s\\n' !(*.*)\n\n", "Q: External HD shows \"Invalid Extent Entry\" in Disk Utility First Aid for the Time Machine \"Backup\" volume. Erase that Backup volume? External is a Seagate 2TB Backup Plus Desktop Drive for Mac. I'm running 10.11.6 on a Mac Mini. It's connected by FW800. Disk Utility First Aid for just that volume stalls after the \"Invalid Extent Entry\" note. \nI ran Disk Utility on the entire external drive (all volumes). Result: [All checks seem good, then...] \"Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting. Operation successful.\"\nOther 3 volumes on that Seagate seem to work fine. One of those volumes has secondary Time Machine backups. \nAfter restart, Mac without prompting says: \"OS X can’t repair the disk “Backup.” You can still open or copy files on the disk, but you can’t save changes to files on the disk. Back up the disk and reformat it as soon as you can.\"\nI assume I should erase that Backup volume but my concern is I'm afraid erasing that Backup volume might screw with the other volumes, and my only other TM backup, which is on another volume of the same external HD.\n\nA: The invalid extent entry error basically means the directory on your drive is corrupted. In other words the index of what files are stored and where they're stored is all mucked up. \nThis can be repaired but not without risk. You basically have two options if you still want to keep using this drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a third party disk utility that can repair the corrupted directory (e.g. DiskWarrior, Techtool Pro, etc)\n\n*Reformat the partition \n\n\nNote: I have no affiliation whatsoever with either DiskWarrior or Techtool Pro.\nRegardless of the option you choose I would still recommend manually backing up any files you can still access to another drive. Obviously this is a must do if you opt for the second option.\nAs to your concern about accidentally reformatting the other partitions, this shouldn't be a problem as long as you're only selecting the particular partition (or volume) with the error.\nMore specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*launch Disk Utility \n\n*select the partition in the sidebar \n\n*click the erase tab\n\n*make sure the format in the drop-down menu is the one you want \n\n*give it a name \n\n*click on Erase\n\n", "Q: Stop automatically opening Photos.app when inserting formatted SD card Whenever I put in my SD card, the Photos app opens automatically.

The Background:\nI am a web developer & graphic designer, both professionally and as a student. This means that in a typical day, I have at least 2 Adobe Creative Suite apps open (Illustrator and Photoshop, usually also with XD and/or InDesign), Brackets, Terminal with my SASS Compiler and LocalHost running, and Chrome in a couple windows, one window running whatever website I'm working on and the corresponding Stack Overflow questions, and one window with my school work (and more Stack Overflow). This is, undeniably, a heavy load.\nI have a Late 2013 MacBook Pro. Here are my specs:\n\nI also have CleanMyMac3, aka my Best Friend™️. \nThe Problem:\nThis thing is constantly freezing. I mean, it's bad. The other night, I was trying to clean/organize my files, and every. time. I'd try to change the Finder window to a new folder, I'd be waiting with the spinning circle of death for a minute or two. This particular time, I also wasn't on a heavy workload. I had Chrome, Brackets, and the usual Outlook and Messages open. Checked CleanMyMac: once it loaded (a few minutes later), I had a little under 300MB of RAM. Looked on Activity Monitor, my CPU was running at 90% capacity (idle between 10% and 15%). Remember, I had a moderate to light workload on it. \nTo fix it, usually I can just restart. This has been happening for months now: randomly, my computer would freeze and go into this mega-slow state, but restarting and cleaning up my startup disk fixed it for a month or two. Within the past month, however, it's been getting so much worse: freezing more and more often, and living for shorter and shorter amounts of time after the restart and clean. Today, I've restarted twice because of it freezing. I'm ready to throw this laptop out of the window. \nWhat I've tried so far:\nI've looked everywhere, and here's what I've found:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the laptop: this fixes it for a little while, not permanent\n\n*Clean the hard drive: also a temporary fix \n\n*Check Activity Monitor:\nnothing threw a red flag at me -- Brackets Helper and Chrome were\nboth up there on the list, but other than that Finder and Kernal\nwere the only two others (and expected ones) -- I was only set off\nby the low amounts of CPU and RAM I have \n\n*Reset NVRAM (command + option + p + r on boot): did nothing  \n\n*Reset SMC (command + option + shift on boot): did nothing \n\n*Check hard drive with SMART Utility:\npassed, but everything was listed as either \"old-age\" or \"pre-fail\"\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that I have to put this heavy of a workload on my laptop. It's what I do. I cannot just stop running these \"heavy applications\" (as many other websites have suggested). I'm of course having some other troubles, that come with age (I bought this back in mid-2014): Bluetooth barely works (a problem many MacBook users have, as I've found), the hard drive is too small, it's running a little hot, there aren't any USB-C ports, and it's overall taken quite the beating and is falling behind. Is there anything I can do to try and save my poor MacBook, or is it time to retire and find something new? I'm looking to upgrade, anyways, as I know my workload is growing too much for my poor baby. I just want to try and milk this guy out as long as he'll last.\n--UPDATE--\nI've also downloaded some system monitoring software, and it's telling me that my CPU Proximity sensor is running around 140 degrees.\n\nA: That's definitely a big load but it doesn't sound seem like it's too much for those specs.  It's tough to troubleshoot something like this with a single answer but my guess is that there's an issue with your SSD.\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily fixed up on Restart.\n\n*Temporarily fixed when startup disk is cleaned.\n\n*You're running with only 10.7% free space.\n\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify that TRIM is running for your SDD. It should be if it's a stock drive but if it was updated, it probably isn't running.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal:\nsystem_profiler SPSerialATADataType | grep 'TRIM'\n\n\n*Looking for \"TRIM Support: Yes\" but if it's no, the free version of Trim Enabler can do this:  https://cindori.org/trimenabler/\n\n\n*Try running the built-in maintenance scripts.  These should be running on a schedule already but you can manually run them in a terminal.\nsudo periodic daily weekly monthly\n\n\n\n*\n\n*These do various tasks with a frequency indicated by their name.  You can learn more about what they do here.\n http://thexlab.com/faqs/maintscripts.html#Anchor-The-11481\n\n\n*You might consider upgrading the SSD before investing in a new system.  macsales.com is great for matching up specific hardware id's to appropriate components.  I'm not endorsing that site.  It's just a starting point.\nHope that helps. Good luck.\n\nA: As you have no doubt found, troubleshooting is often a process of elimination and requires patience.\nMy initial thoughts are that your issue involves the SSD (you don't have a lot of free space for starters). However, the other thing I noticed is what you haven't yet tried as part of your troubleshooting. \nIt would be good to start your MBP in Safe Mode to see if your Mac runs any better during Safe Mode or afterwards when booted normally.\nTo start in Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac \n\n*Restart your Mac \n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you \nhave FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice). \n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. was the issue still there, did it work ok longer than usual, anything else different, etc) \n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal \n\n*Take a note of whether it works any better now that you've booted normally\n\n\nOnce you've tried these steps let me know how you went and we'll go from there.\nReset SMC and NVRAM\nIt's not clear from your question exactly how you reset the SMC, so just to be thorough it'd be good for you to follow the steps below on how to reset it for your particular MBP.\nBefore doing this though I'd like you to reset your NVRAM again as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nAfter booting up, follow these steps to reset the SMC on your particular MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nLet me know what change in behaviour you notice (if any) upon rebooting.\n\nA: Others have given good advise about diagnostics and maintenance but i will reiterate the important points --  You have a combination of to little free space left on your ssd and to little memory for the processes you are running.\n\nPut the maximum amount of memory in your machine that it will hold and clear some space on you ssd or get bigger one. \n\n", "Q: How to transfer data from MacBook Pro 2014(SSD) to MacBook Pro 2016 Hello I have a liquid damage on my MacBook Pro 15inch ( 2014 ) I brought it to service center and they told probably some motherboard issue, but they checked SSD Card and it's completely fine.\nI bought the new 2016 MB Pro 15 Retina and now I Need to Transfer data, I have only SSD chip from old computer. Can I somehow Migrate all data from old SSD to new SSD? I know that  I`m not able to physically replace them.\nBut is there any tools which will help to transfer data from external SSD? \nI need to get all data, profile etc. on my new MacBook.\n\nA: If your old SSD has been removed from the old MBP, then you're best bet is to purchase an external enclosure for you to place it in. \nOnce you've done that you can connect it to your new MacBook Pro and access it like any external drive. At this point you can choose how you want to transfer the data. Probably the easiest will be to use the Migration Assistant app. For more information read Move your content to a new Mac.\nIn terms of the external enclosure you will need to purchase one that can connect to your new MBP, although you may already have various adapters or dongles etc that you can use to connect to USB drives, etc. However, since your old SSD is fine, I'd suggest you get an enclosure you can use all the time (one with the right connection for your scenario) as you'd then have a fast external SSD you can keep using.\nYou can purchase a suitable enclosure online or from most dedicated computer retailers.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro disconnects from the WiFi when not in use I usually download large files overnight but recently I had my mac formatted so all the settings were lost.

However, Safari never turned on the dedicated r460 card, no matter what sites I was seeing.\nCan any body please confirm that the site below is not playable using Safari, and how I can solve this problem?\nThanks,\n\nA: I can confirm that this site does not work in Safari, Safari Technical Preview, or the latest WebKit nightly, as of the 5th of March 2017.\nThe issue is not with your specific hardware (r460), this runs in Chrome on far older hardware. I tested it on a 2009 iMac w/ Nvidia GeForce 9400, it worked in Chrome but ran very slowly, it did not work in Safari. I saw the same behaviour on the 13\" 2016 MacBook Pro with 2 thunderbolt ports.\nThe root cause of the issue seems to be Safari being more picky than Chrome or Firefox. I don't know if this is an issue with the page author's code, or with Safari, but if you open up the Web Inspector's Console tab you'll see that there are a couple of logged errors; an IndexSizeError, and a TypeError. Either way I expect this issue is limited to this site unless you can find additional examples of this.\nYour options for solving this are probably quite limited. You could raise an issue on GitHub on the linked repo, or submit a pull request if you can work out how to fix the issue manually.\nIf you try out other WebGL (v1) examples you shouldn't see this issue, check out a few at this link: http://webglsamples.org\nEdit: I have raised this as an issue on the GitHub repo, I'll update this answer accordingly.\nEdit 2: It's been fixed, although the performance in Safari is quite poor compared to Chrome.\nEdit 3: Safari doesn't support hardware acceleration with WebGL according to the OP's comment from a phone call with Apple Support.

I have DropBox enabled on my Mac running Sierra and I have changed my Safari download location to the Downloads folder I created in my DropBox folder.\nWhenever I download a file under the same name, Safari downloads it as 'name.extension', 'name-1.extension', 'name-2.extension' etc. Is there a way how I can prevent safari from doing this? When I download a file with the same filename, it is normally because it is an updated version from stuff that I make. Since DropBox allows you to revert to the previous version, it does not matter if I accidently  write to the same name since I will be able to restore it.\n\nA: There is no way to override that \"feature\" permanently.  However, there are a couple of workarounds:\nHold the Option Key\nHold down the Option key when you click on the link and it will tell Safari to overwrite the file if it already exists.\nI just tested it on Safari 10.10.3 and it works as expected.\n\nUse Download Linked File As...\nYou can also specify interactively if you want to overwrite the file using the Download Linked File As... option.\nClick on the link while holding the Control key (or right click) and you will be presented with a context\n menu.\nAfter the \"Save File Location\" dialog box, if the file exists, you will be prompted to Replace or Cancel.\n\n\nSet Safari to alway ask where to save downloads\nThis is done in Safari Preferences (⌘, while in Safari).  With this set as Ask for each download. if the file you are attempting to save already exists, you will be presented with a confirmation dialog as above.\n\n\nA: The following trick once worked for me, but it's stopped working.  The problem persists.  Maybe you'll be more fortunate.\nI would click on a .csv file, and try to save it onto an existing file.  Safari pops up a dialog: “such-and-such.csv” already exists. Do you want to replace it?\nI say yes, but it creates a NEW file: \"such-and-such-1.csv\".\nSOLUTION:\n\n*\n\n*Under Safari Preferences, choose the Websites tab.\n\n*On the left, choose Downloads.\n\n*Find the source website, and change its setting from Ask to Allow.\n\nIt's not intuitive, but it works!

Apple solders essentially everything down onto the motherboard (CPU, RAM, chips...). Unless you have insanely good microsoldering skills, you can't swap the CPU or RAM. \nThe only think you could upgrade would be the SSD drive, which should be a M.2 PCIe drive, like this.

Is there a way with macOS 10.12, Sierra, to safely turn off compressed memory? And is there a way to turn off safely swap?\nThis was possible on macOS 10.9 and macOS 10.10. Although it sometimes crashed on macOS 10.10.\nOn macOS 10.11, disabling compressed memory and swap caused a reproducable issue,  click shutdown and OS X freezes.\nSince then I didn't dare to experiment with it in macOS 10.12. But I'm still annoyed that the system wants to use compressed memory for no valid reason (at these fast SSDs I may not mind the swap that much though).\nRegarding, vm_compressor_mode (vm.compressor_mode) values for enabled compressed memory in OS X. Value 1 for vm.compressor_mode will this work on macOS 10.12 or crash like on macOS 10.11?\n\nA: Regardless of whether you use some version of \"official\" settings to turn off swap, it is never really safe to do so. \nQuick refresher about \"swap\". Swap space is memory contents stored on disk. In order to run more programs than physical memory allows, the operating system can \"swap out\" some memory, meaning write the contents of memory to disk, freeing up physical memory for use by other programs. When a program needs to access memory that has been swapped out, the OS \"swaps in\" the memory, meaning it reads the data from the disk back into physical memory. If memory is still full, that means the OS has to swap out some other memory before swapping in the requested memory. This whole scheme only works if there are big chunks of memory not being used for big chunks of time, but that can be the case on Mac, where your word processor can take a break while you are reading your web browser.  \nWith swap, the system can use as much \"virtual memory\" as you have available disk space, and performance will degrade gradually as a higher percentage of memory is on disk. Without swap, the system can abruptly run out of memory, and because swap has been available for decades, the systems really do not handle running out of memory well. Your system and applications can get into all kinds of weird and unhealthy states because running out of memory is just not something people plan for anymore, or more importantly, test for. So even if the OS and apps are supposed to handle out-of-memory conditions, you will very likely run into bugs. If you are going to turn off compressed memory, then it is even more likely you will need swap. You can read first-hand accounts of system freezes due to running out of memory and not having swap in Yosemite. \nSwap is known (by the OS) to be slow, so the software in the OS and affected app software like media players know how to keep critical data in memory and out of swap. If you find the system is using swap and you don't like it, then quit some applications (or close some browser tabs) until you get your \"memory used\" well below your \"physical memory\" and then the swap will gradually be emptied back into real memory, because it has to be read into real memory for a program to use it, and the OS will not swap out that memory back out if there is plenty of free physical memory available. (It used to be that swap space, once allocated, was never released from disk, but that is no longer the case, and even when it was the case, it was still true that the allocated swap space would be \"free\" or unused memory once all the in-use memory would fit in real physical memory.) This is what you would have to do without swap, anyway. \nSo the answer is (a) no, there's no way turn off swap and (b) if there were a way, doing it would lead your system to freeze and/or crash, and so is not worth it.\nAs for turning off memory compression, or as you put it \"Value 1 for vm.compressor_mode will this work on macOS 10.12 or crash like on macOS 10.11\", the answer is much simpler: you cannot turn off memory compression. Starting with macOS 10.12 Sierra, if you try to turn off compression by setting vm.compressor_mode to 1, the kernel treats it as though you set vm.compressor_mode to 4 and turns memory compression on anyway. (See vm_pageout.c). So it won't crash, like with macOS 10.11, but it won't \"work\" to turn off compression, either. (AFAIK, the \"freezer\" modes are for iOS, to support fast resume when app switching. They require the kernel to be compiled with CONFIG_EMBEDDED which the desktop OS is not.)\n", "Q: Why does iTunes play the whole album on shuffle? As the title states, my library is a bit screwed up. For example, when I shuffle my entire library it tends to play some of the albums in its entirety. But this only happens to a few of them. In this case, it's Land of Pleasure & Caress Your Soul by Sticky Fingers and Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager by Kid Cudi. And no matter how many times I keep reshuffling the library, it tends to repeat the whole album everytime it gets to one of the songs. It doesn't even start from the middle, it always begins from the start till the end of the album.\n\nA: It does this because of some broken code in the most recent releases of iTunes. They added a new feature to help those of us who want to properly group, and play in order, classical music. If the Work tag is populated then once itunes sees something in that tag it plays all of the items on the album with the same Work tag. Many have used the groupings field in the past and the latest version grabs the groupings info and stuffs it into the new Work field. So if perhaps you had something like SONY (an album label) in the groupings filed now iTunes thinks every track on the album is part of a classical Work called Sony and that you will want to hear the album in order as you would if it were movements of a classical work. Very frustrating and foolish error on their part. One hopes the can fix this in the next release as it makes shuffle play pretty much un-usable if one uses the grouping field as it was originally intended - to group songs in some way like as Jazz.Standards or World.Music, etc. \n", "Q: Show streaming video to a LG Smart TV I'd like to broadcast videos seen on common web sites (like CNN and such) to my LG Smart TV. \nI know I could use dlna or protocols like that to stream a local video file on the TV, but haven't yet found any way to play streaming videos. \nAny idea? \n\nA: There are multiple ways you can do this.\nSome TVs have a built in casting functionally. Since your TV is a Smart TV, there is a chance that you TV could support this.\nYou could buy a Chromecast. It costs $35 for non-4k, and $69 for 4k. You can use Google Chrome to cast webpages, but some webpages or apps support it natively. This works on both mobile and computer.\nYou could also buy an Apple TV. The latest one costs $150 for 32 GB and $200 for 64 GB. You can cast from both iOS and macOS. You can use AirParrot($20) to airplay from Windows and older macs.\nLastly, you can use the Amazon Fire TV Stick($40) or the Amazon Fire TV($90). This would be my last choice, because it doesn't support casting. Instead, you would use apps. The bonus is that you can use the Alexa remote, sort of like the Siri remote.\nI would choose the Chromecast, because it isn't very pricey, but it enables you to cast anything to your TV.\n\nA: I'm assuming you're using a Mac (by virtue of the fact you've posted your question here).\nMy recommendation would be to purchase an Apple TV 3 (not the current model) as these can be purchased at very reasonable prices and will do exactly what you want, and much more.\nWhat you will need\nYour Mac needs to be running at least OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 or later, and your Mac model needs to fall within the following generations of hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (Mid 2011 or later)\n\n*Mac mini (Mid 2011 or later)\n\n*MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n\n*MacBook Air (Mid 2011 or later)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Early 2011 or later)\n\n*Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n\n\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can actually use older Macs to airplay via the use of AirParrot.\n\n*If you're actually using Windows, you can also use AirParrot.\n\n*You can also use an Apple TV 2, but I would opt at least for an Apple TV 3 as it has a number of benefits over its predecessor.\n\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro (late 2013) whines when sound is triggered I've researched this and found nothing, but it's also just a hard problem to google.\nFor the past year or so, my MacBook has been driving me mad by making this whining sound. It's like a holding 'beep' noise; it continues for 1+ minutes until it stops. To be clear, it doesn't sound like anything mechanical. It doesn't 'rev up' or anything - it is whining, or it is not.\nIt is (usually) triggered by sound. Not by sound actually coming out of the device, because the device can be on mute, but (say) if I play a song, the beeping starts and continues for about a minute after the song finishes.\nI've run a diagnostic and it's clean/normal.\nExceptions: \n* Right now it's just beeping/whining endlessly.\n* I have had it before where is acting completely normal, but when I closed my laptop and reopened it, this behavior started again.\n* Sometimes the device simply doesn't play sound unless I plug in speakers, and it seems to be related. However, I have yet to experience this on the new OS.\nWhat doesn't help:\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting the PRAM\n\n*resetting the SMC\n\n*plugging in speakers/headphones\n\n\n*\n\n*However, plugging in speakers does make the sound emit from the speakers instead of the device.

I now try to find areas of destructive interference so that it's quieter when I move my head there. I can't use headphones anymore because the aforementioned trick doesn't work when it whines directly into the ear.\nAny suggestions would be great! I'm happy to try pretty much anything. Thanks!\n\nA: What you are hearing is either capacitor squeal, or  coil noise.\nBasically, it's just an audible sound of the electrons as they flow through components and they cause the nearby components to resonate enough to be audible.\nMost of the time it's benign, but (obviously) can be really annoying.  In the case of capacitors, however, it may also be a sign of an imminent (or recent) failure.\nThere's a good article describing this: \nCapacitor squeal & coil whine explained \nEither way, if you are under warranty (for any device, not just Apple), you can get it resolved.  Even if you are not under AppleCare, I would definately take it in and see what they can do for you.\nIf you cannot get Apple to service it, have a look at Rossman Computers out of NYC.  He has been able to repair what Apple said couldn't be repaired.  I am not affiliated with him in anyway, I am just a satisfied client.\n", "Q: Export Documents and Data from iPad When I plug in my iPad to iTunes 12 on Windows, it shows Documents and Data occupies about 8 GB.

I broke my iPhone 5, so I got a iPhone SE but I still have the iCloud backups for my old iPhone. I cannot backup my iPhone SE before I delete my old iPhone backup because my iCloud storage is full.\nWould deleting my old iCloud backups ruin anything on my new phone?\n\nA: No it shouldn't, because the backups don't affect anything anyway.\n\nThe short answer is no—deleting your old iPhone backup from iCloud is completely safe and won’t affect any of the data on your actual iPhone. In fact, even deleting the backup of your current iPhone won’t have any impact on what’s actually on your device.

I'm converting from Evernote to Dropbox/Markdown for my notes. And I really love the quick note capture menu bar applet for Evernote (image below).\n\nAnyone know of something similar for plain text notes? Ideally it quickly stores the note as a .md file in ~/Dropbox/Notes. But .txt files can also work. This is on macOS Sierra.\n\nA: I recommend NValt, a fork of Notational Velocity:\nhttp://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\nIt doesn't work in the menubar, but you can configure a shortcut to show/hide the NV window if you want. It's also got a built in search, kind of like spotlight, which you can use to open notes quickly. Here's a screenshot:\n\nBy default it saves the files in a database, but you can also save the notes in a specified directory as plaintext, RTF or HTML files. Or you can synchronize it with Simplenote (but Dropbox will work just as well if you use files/db). Markdown support is not first class, but it works when you save as RTF or HTML.\n\nA: I am searching for something like that too. I tried Curiota but missed the ability to take quick screenshots and audio notes from the Evernote Helper.  \nSo my current solution is about just using the Evernote Helper (without Evernote running) to jot down text, images or taking screenshots/audio notes and then selecting the contents using [command ⌘] A and sending it the app of choice (granted it has a Services menu item). I don't need to have Evernote running to use the menu bar item so it is ok for me.\nI never actually save to Evernote. When I have some time I will write an importer to do the importing for me. The beautiful thing is that if you write in markdown and send it to a Markdown app the formatting will be clean!\n\nBut searching for a better solution better as well. \n", "Q: How do I add a directory to PATH when using `zsh` in Sierra In macOS Sierra 10.12.x, what is the modern way to add a directory to the PATH environment variable that can work across shells or specifically work with zsh shell (I switched from the default bash to zsh). \nI have seen some Questions and Answers such as this one that are bash-specific. And I have seen some such as this one about launchd but it seems I've read launchd is not the right right in later versions of macOS (not sure). I could find no specific references for Sierra, so I am posting now.\nI am trying to install Maven with instructions saying:\n\nAdd the bin directory of the created directory apache-maven-3.3.9 to the PATH environment variable\n\n\nA: In zsh, including on macOS, you should add entries to your path in your .zshrc. By default this file is read from the directory located in $ZDOTDIR which defaults to $HOME if not set.\nTo add an entry there, you may follow instructions for bash and add a line such as:\nexport PATH=/opt/apache-maven-3.8.2/bin:$PATH\n\nor because zsh also offers an interface to the path in the $path environment variable, which is an array, you may also use:\nexport path=(/opt/apache-maven-3.8.2/bin $path)\n\nEither of these will add /opt/apache-maven-3.8.2/bin to your path before the previous contents of the path.\nThe order is important particularly for programs such as zsh which may be present at /bin/zsh and at /usr/local/bin/zsh, as would be the case if it is installed using homebrew (/bin/zsh being the default installation). If you install it separately, you probably want to use it and so should make sure that /usr/local/bin precedes /bin on your path, so to add it you should use:\npath=(/usr/local/bin $path)\n\nin that order. And don't forget to export it after updating it with export path or precede path= with export.\nIf you are heavily customizing your zsh installation, you may be tempted to set the path in $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. This should be avoided. Prior to loading that file, /etc/zprofile is read, which in a default macOS installation executes:\nif [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n    eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\nfi\n\nWhich will screw the ordering of any customizations to your path. See the zsh man page with man zsh for the details of the load order or man path_helper for an explanation of that utility.\n\nA: export\nTo change the path within your shell session, not system-wide, you can use the bash-style export command with zsh, as documented here. \nThe name of the PATH variable is case-sensitive and must be all-uppercase.\nexport PATH=$PATH:/folder/you/want\n\nTo verify your change, run:\necho $PATH\n\nYou will see results like this.\n\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/folder/you/want\n\n\nA: This answer (to a different question) suggests modifying /private/etc/paths or adding a file to the directory /private/etc/paths/d. I just tried sudo nano /private/etc/paths, added /foo at the end of the file, and opened a new tab in Terminal, and echo $PATH showed /foo as expected, in both bash and zsh shells.\nAssuming you've installed Maven to /opt/apache-maven-3.3.3 you could add /opt/apache-maven-3.3.3/bin to /private/etc/paths. However, and I've not tried this (it's been several years since I last did any Java development), I'd be inclined to instead add a file Maven (containing /opt/apache-maven-3.3.3/bin) to /private/etc/paths.d - that'll encapsulate the Maven-specific path change, making it easier to clean up if you ever delete (or upgrade) Maven.\n\nA: If your using zsh\n\n*\n\n*edit zshrc\n\n*source ~/.zshrc\n\n*exit that terminal by command + w\n\nit will save your changes permanently.\n", "Q: Text in place of Finder icons (MacOS Sierra) My finder looks like this:\n\nIf I click on the text 'view', 'action' etc, it shows all the options and I'm able to use it quite normally.

Creating new tabs, launching programs, all lead into the \"beachball of death\" for a while.\nIs this 6~7 year old laptop done for, or is it a fixable problem? If you need more technical information about the laptop, or if I run into any additional issues, I'll keep the post updated.\n\nA: As you probably know, troubleshooting is a process of elimination and can require quite a bit of patience.\nThe first things I'd do in your situation are reset your NVRAM, reset your SMC, and perhaps try booting in Safe Mode.\nReset NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this. Here’s how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nOnce you've reset your NVRAM, proceed to reset your SMC as well.\nReset SMC\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nOnce you're booted back in, take a note of how your MBP is running. If the symptoms persist, proceed to boot into Safe Mode.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps boot your MBP into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice. Also, it will take longer than usual to boot.)\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. Are you still experiencing the same issues, etc)\n\n*Once you've used your Mac long enough to know if it's working any better, exit Safe Mode by restart your Mac as normal.\n\n*After booting your Mac normally, take a note again of what happens (i.e. Are you still experiencing the same issues, etc)\n\n\nLet me know how you went and we'll go from there.\nAs an aside\nIn your question you ask Is this 6~7 year old laptop done for, or is it a fixable problem?\nTime will only tell whether your issue is fixable, but I see you only have 4GB RAM installed, so from the point of view of whether your laptop is done it certainly has the capacity to be upgraded. In fact, it can support up to 16GB RAM (although only 8GB officially). \nAlso, your 13\" model was not affected by the the MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010) GPU issues that resulted in a recall by Apple. So, at this stage, I wouldn't give up on your MBP just yet.\n", "Q: Change screenshot destination on Touch Bar Mac (macOS Sierra) I have a late 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and when taking a screenshot, I get the option to choose the location on the Touch Bar. \nHowever since I'm using my computer in clamshell mode, I can't see the Touch Bar, and always want to save my screenshots in a specific folder.\nThe Touch Bar behaviour seems to override the screenshot location that I have set in com.apple.screencapture:\n~$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture\n{\n    location = \"/Users/[my_username]/Pictures/screenshots/\";\n}\n\nEven if the above is set, it always saves to Documents, which I chose on the Touchbar once.\nAlso if I choose Desktop as the location on the Touch Bar, it's ignored, and it saves in Documents. So it seems to malfunction even when using the Touch Bar.\nSo is there a \"defaults key\" (?) that stores the location since the above is ignored, or is there a conflict between the Touch Bar and the default setting that can be fixed?\n\nA: As of Mojave 10.14.2 version, you can change \"Save to\" destination by entering screenshot mode (press screenshot key on touchbar or Command+Shift+5), then you'd see quick tools (region selection, etc). Go to Options -> Save to... -> Other location... and choose desired location for your screenshots.\nNow all screenshot (even those you process with quick editor after making a screenshot) will be stored at chosen folder.\nAnd you don't need any specific software or scripts.\n\nA: If you are using a Mac with a touch bar, there are two things that you can do to make taking screenshots more simple. \nGo into System Preferences\nThen into Keyboard\nClick shortcuts\nOn the left hand side click screen shots. \nIf you are wanting your screen shots to default to a folder, make sure that only the Save picture of...as a file are the only boxes selected. \nThe second thing you can do to make a life of screen shots easier is to: \nGo into System Preferences\nClick Keyboard \nat the bottom of the window find customize control strip...\nFrom there you will see a screen that looks something like this.\nYou can then click and drag the camera or screenshot icon into your touch bar. \nThere you have it, if you have followed both of these steps, your fingers will no longer get tired if you are taking a ton of screenshots all at once, and you never have to worry again about where or in what folder your screenshots are going to end up. \n\nA: I can’t figure out how to edit the save locations either, so this is not a full answer to your question.\nBut you did ask in your comment how to reset it so that you can choose location on the Touch Bar again. Run the command defaults delete com.apple.screencapture. It appears that setting is no longer needed with Touch Bar, but overrides Touch Bar save location if it it is set.\n\nA: From what I've seen, you can override the location set on the Touch Bar ONLY if your Touch Bar has been set to \"Desktop\". If the Touch Bar is set to save in one of it's other pre-set locations (Desktop, Documents, Clipboard, Preview, Mail, Messages), screenshots will always be saved there instead of your custom location set in com.apple.screencapture. Your milage may vary but that seems to be what's happening on my machine.\nSee my other thread on SuperUser:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1316315/cannot-change-macos-10-13-4-screenshot-location/\n", "Q: How to make 'grep' work like in Ubuntu? I tried to use grep to match one pattern on the terminal, but n\no any result comes out.\n$ grep -R 'networks'\ngrep: warning: recursive search of stdin\n\nI knew grep on macOS is based on BSD while grep on Ubuntu is based on GNU.\nHow to make 'grep' work on macOS like in Ubuntu?\n\nA: When the -R option is used, MacOS grep requires you to explicitly give it a directory to search; for example, specify . to recursively search the current directory:\ngrep -R 'networks' .\n\n\nA: Long term, it's probably best to install the tools based on GNU or run Ubuntu virtually. Both are available for free. \nbrew install coreutils (to run the brew command you need to install homebrew from https://brew.sh) will put the GNU versions of the tools in your path. Look for the ggrep command and possibly a standalone grep package to install as the coreutils does tend to change over time what it includes.\n(EDIT: Note that as of 2018, grep specifically needs to be installed separately from coreutils as follows:\n$ brew install grep\n$ ggrep sometext file.txt     # Note the executable is called ggrep with two G's\n\nand has a unique executable name ggrep with two G's.)\nAlso searching here for GNU or coreutils will be helpful for context and tips/tricks. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to get the full suite of unix options for the command line tools on OS X?\n\n*Removing the builtin command-line utilities from PATH, zsh\n\n*How to have GNU's date in OS X?\n\n*Make ls command sort by file type (e.g. directories and file extension)\n", "Q: Upgrade Cost From Previous MacOS Version to Sierra This is going to be a very simple and straight forward question. I do not have experience of using any MacBook. I'm a software engineer by profession and I'm considering to purchase a MacBook to get started with iOS development. I got some quotations from a local Apple Authorized Reseller and they are saying that they have 2 MacBooks that fall in my budget. Budget can be increased though. One is Apple MacBook Pro Retina 13.3\" (MF839ZA/A). It has \"Mac OS X Yosemite\" on it. If I purchase this MacBook then can I upgrade the OS X to \"Sierra\"?\nWhat will be the software upgrade costs from the following OS X versions to Sierra:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mavericks to Sierra \n\n*Yosemite to Sierra \n\n*El Capitan to Sierra\n\n\nWhat are the minimum hardware requirements or MacBook version requirements for me to install Sierra on it?\nI need Sierra for XCode 8.0+.\n\nA: Apple last charged for upgrades at 10.8 Mountain Lion. Major upgrades have been free of charge since then. The system requirements are publicly listed. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/\n\nMac computers introduced in late 2009 or later can be upgraded to macOS Sierra.\n\nYou can also rely on Apple providing you a clean copy of the OS that shipped with the hardware via support download if it's Lion or later. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204319\n", "Q: Get serial numbers of connected USB devices I'm searching for a terminal command to find out the serial numbers of connected USB devices on macOS computers. Is there any equivalent to the linux command \"usb-devices\"? I tried \"ioreg -p IOUSB\" but the output does not contain the serial numbers.\n\nA: Information about USB Devices is stored differently under Linux then macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Linux, usb-devices is a bash script that essentially reads a bunch of text files, symlinked to /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb*, that contain information about the USB Devices and formats it in the output you see under Linux.\n\n*In macOS, it does not have such a script as it doesn't store the information in the same manner. However, if you want to output information about USB Devices that are enumerated by the OS, in Terminal, then use the following command:\nsystem_profiler SPUSBDataType\n\nIf a USB Device has a serial number it will be shown in the output.\n\nAs mentioned by Allan in his comment, you can use the following command to minimize the output to include relevant portions of the device information that contain the device name and serial number with a bit of additional info.\nsystem_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep \"Serial Number\" -B5\n\nNote that doing this does obscure some of the device information as compared to the info outputted by usb-devices, although it may be unnecessary info depending on your needs.\n\nAs an example, here is the usb-devices output, in Linux, for an 8 GB USB Flash Drive:\nT:  Bus=03 Lev=02 Prnt=03 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#=  6 Spd=480 MxCh= 0\nD:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=00(>ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1\nP:  Vendor=0781 ProdID=5530 Rev=01.26\nS:  Manufacturer=SanDisk\nS:  Product=Cruzer\nS:  SerialNumber=20042214412B1A33690E\nC:  #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=80 MxPwr=200mA\nI:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=08(stor.)

I'm trying to make this app \"forget\" me and not be able to identify me when I install it again. I'm on my iPad Air 2 with iOS 10.1.1.\nI read on another question that they cannot see your unique device identifier anymore. Are they able to persist data in any way (I have iCloud turned off), or can they view my Apple ID? Do I need to perform a full reset?\n\nA: Since you haven't identified the app in question we can only provide fairly generic advice. One thing apps can do is view identifiers such as the media access control (MAC) address. This is not to be confused with Mac as in Apple Mac.\nThe MAC address of a device is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for the purpose of communications. Most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi, use MAC addresses. Devices that have MAC addresses are not just computers, smartphones and tablets. They can include anything that connects to a network (e.g. printers, smart TVs, weather stations, etc).\nIf you're concerned about a particular app, you should take the time to read its privacy policy.\nIf your question is really about something else, such as wanting to change accounts used for the app, you may be best to contact the developer directly or use their support pages.\n[EDIT]\nAs suggested by bmike in comments, I'm updating this answer to include info on changes that Apple are enforcing as of the soon-to-be-released iOS 10.3 update.\nUp until now, keychain data in iOS remained on the device even after the app was deleted from the device. After upgrading to iOS 10.3 deleting an app will also delete all associated keychain contents for that app unless its keychain item is shared with other apps. In that event, the keychain data won't be deleted until those other apps are also deleted.\nApple's intention with this is to further protect user privacy by ensuring that any information that can identify a user is not left on the device after the app that saved it is removed from the device.\nIn a nutshell - anyone concerned about their personal data should upgrade to iOS 10.3 if their device supports it.\n\nA: iOS App store apps (on stock, non-jailbroken, iOS 10 devices) can no longer directly get the device's MAC address.  The current iOS 10 APIs return a generic fake MAC address.  There is no API for an app to get your Apple ID (unless you get the user to voluntarily manually type it into the app) or Unique ID in iOS 10 (only very early iOS versions, e.g. iOS 3, etc., may have allowed this).\nHowever, some apps can store persistent data in your device's Keychain (used by iOS to store passwords, etc.)  If you delete an app, it may be possible for a re-installed app to see if previous keychain contents exist.  The only way to completely delete all Keychain data might be to Erase all Contents and Settings, and set up the device as new.\n", "Q: SIP won't stay disabled - I think I wiped my SSD clean, reinstalled OS X El Capitan, removed corestoreage, and went on to remove SIP using csrutil disable in the command+R recovery environment. (I also tried it from the installation medium) It says it was successful and that I should reboot. I do that and once logged in, I type csrutil status and get back;\nSystem Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration)\n\nConfiguration:\n  Apple Internal: disabled\n  Kext Signing: disabled\n  Filesystem Protections: disabled\n  Debugging Restrictions: disabled\n  Dtrace Restrictions: disabled\n  NVRAM Protections: disabled\n\nThis is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.\n\nSo, I reset the PRAM & SMC several times, rebooted afterwards several times, and did it again (several times) and I still get the same message. So..... is it disabled or not? :)\nThe one, possibly, weird thing, was that I installed an update to the recovery system via the App Store. It also wanted me to install Sierra but I'm not sure I want that yet. Did this \"newer\" version of the recovery make it not possible to disable it? I remember a less confusing message the last time I did it - like 2 years ago or more.\nAlso, I ran ls -lO /usr and it said restricted.\nMy mac is a :\nMBP retina 15\" Mid 2014\nThanks much!\nedit\nBy the way, I did look at this:  Issue in disabling SIP (rootless) in El Capitan but running ls -lO /usr is what causes me to be concerned still....\n\nA: The message you're getting confirms that you have SIP disabled as you can see that all the individual items are disabled.\nThe reason you're getting this sort of confusing message is that you've just re-installed El Capitan. It's the message format that was used in El Capitan 10.11.0 and 10.11.1. Apple changed this with the release of El Capitan 10.11.2 so that the message was clearer.\n", "Q: How to create bootable Mavericks external USB hard drive from Sierra? I'm trying to create an external hard drive that can boot off Mavericks to run old software that doesn't work on later versions of OS X / macOS. The only Apple computer I have available is a MacBook Pro 13 inch Retina, mid 2014 which is running Sierra. According to Apple's documentation, the original version of OS X that came with this computer should be 10.9.4, so I don't understand why it wouldn't be supported.\nI've tried creating a bootable USB installer by cloning the base system .dmg that comes with the App Store installer, as well as using the USB image creator that comes with it. In both cases I can choose it as a bootable device, but immediately get a \"prohibited\" symbol and the installation does not continue.\nI've also tried using a USB 2.0 device instead of 3.0 to boot, and using Carbon Copy Cloner instead of Disk Utility to create the bootable device. No luck in either case.\n\nA: You are correct that your model MBP did originally ship with Mac OS X 10.9.4.\nHowever, in October 2015 Apple released a firmware update for the EFI Boot ROM of this model. My guess is you updated the firmware (it was an extremely important update to address a security risk). If so, your MBP is unable to boot into any version of OS X prior to 10.9.5.\nYou can read more a brief description of the MBP111.0138.B16 (2015-002) firmware update or more detailed info here.\n", "Q: Why does Python's readline.read_history_file not work from a script, but work interactively?

I'm a huge clutz, and I constantly accidentally destroy electronics. A few days ago, I just barely caught my Macbook Pro as it almost fell off a balcony, and decided I really need insurance for this thing, specifically insurance that covers accidental damage.\nThe computer was bought over a year ago, so I can't get AppleCare, and from what I understand AppleCare doesn't cover accidental damage anyway. The laptop is a 2015 model 15-inch Retina Macbook Pro that costs over $2,000, and I'm terrified I won't be able to pay to repair or replace is should I break it.\nHow can I add insurance or a warranty of some sort so I won't have to pay for repairs, or at least have repair costs reduced to something manageable, should this happen?\n\nA: AppleCare isn't insurance. You should start with Amazon in your country if available and then check your local / national insurance providers to pick a policy that meets your needs. \nIf you already have renters or homeowners insurance, a rider might be all you need to cover computer equipment for little hassle of shopping for a policy. \n", "Q: MBP 2012 +, light projector, Home Theater system, HDMI spitter, no audio, puzzle? This issue relates to Mac Book Pro's and hdmi audio functionality. \nI am trying to resolve an issue for a community hall. The hall has a light projector (BenQ) with small internal speaks, and a Home Theater box with surround sound system (Sony BDV-E290). \nAll hdmi ports and cables are hdmi 1.4.\nNormally, a single HDMI cable connects the light projector to the hdmi (incl ARC - Audio Return Channel) port on the back of the Home Theater unit. \nThe Home Theater unit has the surround sound speakers connected to it.  \nOne can play a video file put on a usb thumb drive and plugging it into the Home Theater unit. Both video on light projector and sound via surround sound speakers plays. \nConnect MacBookPro mid 2012 Retina laptop, so as to play video using internet on this system using the hdmi port. Connect MBP via hdmi cable to a powered hdmi splitter. This is to enable one hdmi cable out of the splitter to go to the light projector, while a second hdmi cable plugged into the hdmi port of the home theater unit so it can play the hdmi delivered digital sound data. \nWith this set up there is no sound from the home theater unit speakers, only video on the light projector. \nDespite checking all home theater, and MBP settings, reading manuals, and lots of net research re Mac hdmi, hdmi sound, hdmi standards, etc. I am very puzzled. \nThe below diagram illustrates this set up. \nThe question is, should I expect this to work? \nAlternatively, am I missing some technical understanding of the hdmi and sound capability of the macbook pro, hdmi port, or hdmi splitter, or concept of hdmi delivered ARC return?\nAfter several hours of research I do not understand what the problem is conceptually, or in practice. \nI have confirmed that the audio data output via the MBP hdmi port is active, and all hdmi cables are working. I have confirmed the surround sound speakers are working. I have read (several times) the home theater instruction manuals and tried all settings to my understanding, and played with any other setting I could think of value. \nOne experienced mac person's solution is that I need to use an hdmi switcher, rather than an hdmi splitter, and use an hdmi audio extractor to stream off the audio data from the laptops hdmi cable. Then rather than the audio data being supplied to the home theater box via its hdmi port, input the audio data via a fibre Tosink audio cable into the audio fibre port available on the theatre box for 5.1 surround sound. \nThis I think should work. However, I am puzzled and questioning that I should need to do this.  Surely such a simple first solution should work. Yet, it does not.\nSome relevant links:\nHDMI ARC functionality Confirms my understanding and use of ARC via hdmi. \nApple MBP hdmi port audio functionality Confirms MBP hdmi port includes hdmi 1.4 and 5.1 surround sound consistent with home theatre box. \n\n\nA: The below solution has now been implemented. It did work. \nCan now plug in a laptop, access internet, play video, and have sound play via home theatre system. \n\nThis technical information is key to why this set up does not work.  \n\nHDMI-ARC uses two pins on the hdmi cable an unused one and the hot detect pin, it is not part of the normal data stream and does not use the normal pins.\n  It's basically a coax spdif connection in reverse.\n\nThe confusion has arisen it would appear, when the home theatre box manual mentions ARC return feature associated with the HDMI port in a way suggestive of it being essentially a two way hdmi port. \nIt would seem ARC does not deliver audio data by the standard way of hdmi video/audio data streaming protocols, or even by the same internal physical pins. \nA TV set will return ARC signal, as it is designed to use this different standard for the return audio.  \nApparently, ARC is part of the hdmi standard though, as was commented on another site. \n\nARC is part of the hdmi standard .... it was an addition to HDMI to allow a TV to return audio back to an AVR., to replace a spdif coax or optical cable.\n\nThis missing technical understanding re ARC explains why a suggested solution was to add to the hdmi cable from the laptop at the theater box end, an hdmi audio extractor box, with a audio fibre Toslink (for 5.1 surround sound) or RCA for stereo sound, input to those available audio input connections on the back of the home theater unit. \nThe situation has been confusing. It would seem reasonable to assume the connection functionality of the home theater box would be inclusive of plugging in a laptop device, one accessing the internet for various audio visual media. Hence, when not working, the natural assumption is that there was something wrong with the numerous setting options, which is where I began, or the functional capacity of the hdmi laptop port or laptop settings. \nHowever, it seems not so. The danger of unconscious assumptions!\nA second part of the problem is that it the hdmi splitter should be an hdmi switcher, so that the hdmi video data can be selected as coming from the theater box or the laptop. \nDiagram of expected solution set up below. \nCredit and thanks to the guys on the Whirlpool site, as well as those commenting here. \n\n", "Q: How do I silence my phone for ten minutes?

My MacOS non-admin account is not a member of group 'wheel.'  But any file I create in /tmp from Terminal commands is always group wheel.\nThere is no sticky bit nor ACL nor extended attribute to explain this on the symlink /tmp or on /private/tmp which it points to.\nI like to use /tmp as a scratchpad because the system cleans it up for me on every boot.\n\nA: By default, new files inherit the group assigned to the directory they're created in. /tmp (actually /private/tmp) is assigned to the wheel group, therefore your new files created there get assigned to the wheel group.\nBTW, if you're worried that this assignment is going to cause problems, don't. The default permissions on new files in macOS gives the group and everyone else read-only access, meaning that the wheel group gets ... exactly the same access that everyone else does. Also, the wheel group itself is sort of a nothing. In traditional unixes, it's sort of the group for computer administrators; in macOS, that function is taken over by the \"admin\" group. The only remaining member of the wheel group on macOS is the root user, which has full access to everything anyway, so its group membership doesn't really matter. Actually, the way wheel gets used in macOS is more-or-less as a placeholder; there has to be some group assigned, but it's not actually going to do anything... I know, just use \"wheel\".\n\nA: The group classification is inherited from the directory in which the file is created in.\n", "Q: Unable to load https websites on safari I have an old iMac running OSX 10.7.5/Safari 6.1.6.\nDue to some programs on that system & generally slow systems on similar iMacs with more recent OSX version I do not want to update to a newer OSX\nI have several websites forcing https which I can no longer access as safari says \"Safari can not open the page …, as safari can not establish a secure connection to …\" (translated from german).\nChrome and Firefox on the same machine are able to open these pages, as are more recent Safaris on more recent machines. \nI tried downloading/installing the root certificate in the keychain, but this did not help.\nAre there some security updates I'm not getting via normal system updates which could fix this?\nFor example: www.biblio.lu\n\nA: Safari 6/OS X doesn't support TLSv1.2.

To hook it up to my Air, I convert a mini-DP signal to HDMI. With two different cables, I started noticing occasional latency on the signal where the screen freezes for about a second and then it becomes responsive again.\nSome more interesting tidbits:\n\n\n*\n\n*This happens on my laptop screen as well as the external monitor while I'm connected to the display.\n\n*I can use the on-screen menu of my monitor while my screen is frozen.\n\n*I never had this issue with my previous screen, a 16:9 Full HD monitor with a DVI port.\n\n*I tried an AmazonBasics Mini-DP to HDMI cable (maximum resolution of 1920x1080) as well as a Mini-DP to HDMI adapter from an obscure brand together with an HDMI-to-HDMI cable. Both gave the same results.\n\n*I'm using macOS Sierra on a 2015 MacBook Air.\n\n*My new monitor's native resolution is 2560x1080.\n\n*The issue only seems to manifest while I'm moving my mouse, so there seems to be some interplay with mouse input and display output. I haven't seen it happen while I type yet.\n\n*I tried reproducing the issue while a video was playing. Most of the time both the pointer and the video froze, but sometimes only the pointer froze. This makes me believe it's not related to the monitor itself or the cable.\n\n\nHow can I find out what's causing the random freezes and fix the issue?\n\nA: More than likely, the issue is, in fact,  your Mini DP to HDMI adapter.\nThe AmazonBasics Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter  adapter that you listed is a passive adapter (notice nowhere do they say \"active\").    Additionally, is much less expensive than an active converter like the Cable Matters Active Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter\nPassive vs. Active\nSo, what's the big difference?  A lot, actually.  A passive adapter, to make a long story short, basically takes the pin outs of the Mini Display Port and configures them as HDMI.  Most of the time, this works, however there are a lot of limitations.  For example, the signaling of HDMI is 5V while mDP/DP is 3V.  Some monitors don't like this.  Additionally, HDMI has a clock signal where DP doesn't.\nAn active adapter addresses these issues; there's actually a chip that does the conversion of the DP signal to a \"proper\" HDMI signal with the correct voltage and clock signaling.\nA Microsoft engineer has an excellent blog post on this very subject\n\nJust to address some of the points in your question to reduce confusion...\n\n*\n\n*Your OSD has absolutely nothing to do with the display coming out of your Mac.  It's an \"overlay\" that comes from the monitor and if you computer hangs, it will continue to work.  It will even work if no video source is connected to your monitor at all.\n\n\n*If it happens on both screens, your computer is hanging because it is probably getting bad signals coming back from the monitor.\n\n\n*You never had issues before because you were going native DP to DP.\n\n\n*There's really no \"interplay\" between your mouse (or keyboard) and your GPU - one doesn't affect the other.  A video may crash for a number of reasons, none of which will be your mouse.  What you are seeing is your CPU/GPU having to \"deal\" with the video conversion of two very different signals.\n\nA: I had similar issue when connecting my MacBook Pro to projector using HDMI. The issue happened from both direct HDMI and from MiniDP to HDMI. The MacBook froze with blank screen and nothing on the projector either. I just tested with MiniDP to VGA and Connected VGA to the projector. This ran without any freezing problem. Unfortunately I had to revert to yesterday's technology. \n", "Q: Downsides of encrypting disk with FileVault Is there any downside of encrypting my OS X 10.10.5 laptop via FileVault, in terms of usability? \nObviously, if I lose the password I can no longer use the laptop. (out of interest is that correct, will the laptop be completely un usable, or will the hard drive be unusable eg. if I were to swap out the HD for a new HD could i use the laptop again)\nBut apart from that would any other features stop working when the laptop was unlocked because it is encrypted (e.g. file sharing, printer sharing, Apple Remote Desktop, performance degradation, security issues).\nI'm setting up the MacBook as new and debating turning on FileVault or not.\n\nA: You might get some performance degradation, but for what it's worth I've never noticed any.\nYou won't lose any functionality whatsoever. The only inconvenience I've run into is I can no longer reboot my Mac remotely (as I'd need my password to unlock it again). Other than that, it's been fine.\n\nA: Just wanted to add something because I was hindered by a change no mentioned above. It's not a deal breaker but knowing would have saved me a lot of time and worry.\n\n\n*\n\n*This may just be an issue with my computer; but when booting in recovery mode (holding 'option' at boot) I will not be given the built in recovery partition as an option. Instead I have to (hold 'command-r' on boot) to access it.\n\n*When using disk Utility in Recovery Mode you are required to fist Mount the FileVault protected drive. Without doing so will return worrying errors that state unsuitability; instead of telling you to mount first, which would help immensely. It makes sense why since you are not required to enter the FileVault decryption password to startup from recovery OS, so disk utility has not been given access yet. To do so click the greyed out disk icon and click Mount.\n\nA: The implementation of Corestorage / Filevault2 is pretty great. That means you will hardly notice that your system is encrypted. I see the following points you may want to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*As you say: If you loose the passcode it is next to impossible to access your data. \n\n*There is a very slight performance hit because the CPU needs to constantly encrypt and decrypt your data. But moderns CPUs are optimised to do so and therefore the impact is negligible. \n\n*If your disk is corrupted or faulty in some way it may be more difficult to fix a corestorage volume than a standard HFS volume. Personally, this has never been a problem for me. \n\n*Passwordless boot or waking from standby is not possible anymore.\n\n*The most obvious difference is pre-boot authentication. That means you need to enter your password before  the Mac boots up. Without encryption the system would boot and only require your password to log into an account. \n\n*Depending on your level of paranoia Filevault2 alone may not be enough. You should consider to also encrypt your backups (even higher risk for total data loss) and activate the option to destroy the password from RAM while the Mac sleeps. \n\n", "Q: osascript bug: AppleScript's initial \"choose from list\" dialog is unselected I run the following code in Terminal:\nosascript \"/Users/Me/Desktop/Run this script on wake.scpt\"\n\nIf the first dialog of my .scpt file is a choose from list dialog, then this dialog will be unselected. That is, I cannot simply hit the enter key to press \"OK\"; I must first click anywhere on the dialog to make the top bar of the dialog change from white to grey, and only then can I hit enter to proceed.\nTo be clear, the dialog comes to the front just fine - it is simply not selected.\nHowever, if the first dialog is a display dialog or display alert dialog, then the dialog is automatically selected. It just so happens that the initial dialog of my .scpt file is a choose from list dialog.\nI tried writing activate me on the line above the choose from list dialog, but this did not do anything.\nWhen I run the \"Run this script on wake.scpt\" from within Script Editor, the choose from list dialog is in fact selected. Hence, we know that the issue is related to osascript.\nDoes anyone have a workaround to force the choose from list dialog to be automatically selected?\nI've tried implementing a default selection by inserting the default items parameter in the choose from list command (even though I don't actually want a default item to exist in this case). I thought that doing this might force the dialog to be selected. But, still, the list dialog is unselected.\nAs a last resort, I suppose that I could use AppleScript to mouse-click the center of the screen (where the dialog is located). But, I'd prefer a more elegant solution, as AppleScript can be unreliable when it comes to mouse clicks.\n\nIf you are wondering why I am employing osascript in the first place, it is because I am using SleepWatcher to automatically run an AppleScript when my computer wakes from sleep. (Here is a very helpful guide that I used to set up SleepWatcher.)\nThis is the full text of my .wakeup file:\n#!/bin/bash\nosascript \"/Users/Me/Desktop/Run this script on wake.scpt\"\n\n\nA: This is weird..  For now, I'd recommend that you save your script as an executable. This can be done by opening your Applescript in the Script Editor, then clicking the File menu, then Export, then choosing \"Application\" in the File Format dropdown box.  You could then create an Applescript that executes this application.\n\nA: As I already found out in context of a different question, your problem is the \"me\" in your script and therefore is not only \"related\" to osascript:\nosascript IS YOUR problem…\n… as osascript is NOT a mere command in Terminal but actually a process of its own.\nIf you want to open a file from Terminal you have to \"activate Terminal\" and NOT \"activate me\" [= osascript].\n(Since you already accepted one answer as your \"chosen\" one, I will confine my answer to this hint.)\n", "Q: How to get Pages in Mac Yosemite 10.10.05 to recognise different languages for spelling?

If there is only the Macbook 12 inch USB-C charger nearby, can it be used to charge other USB-C devices, such as any Android phones that also use USB-C? (will it be \"too powerful\" and damage other devices?)\nVice versa, if there is a Quick Charge 2.0 or 3.0 USB-C charger from other devices nearby, can it be used to charge the Macbook 12 inch?\nThe main concern is about whether it could damage the device or battery.\n\nA: Short answer\nTo address your main concern about whether it could damage the device or battery when charging devices with a charger not specifically designed for that device, the answer is yes, it could. However, in some cases it will be fine. The only way anyone here may be able to answer that question is to know the exact models of the device(s) and charger(s) you're talking about.\nLong answer\nWhile I understand your question, it's impossible to give a generic answer. \nThe reason for this is different chargers will have different voltage/wattage ratings.\nUsing MacBooks as an example, they typically require in the range of 55 watts to 90 watts of power in order to charge (depending on the model, e.g. the late-2016 13\" MacBook Pros require 60 watts, while the 15\" models require 85 watts).\nSo, it is possible that you have a USB-C charger from another device laying around that provides enough juice to charge one model of MacBook and not enough to charge another. Or, it may be enough to charge one model in a few hours but not enough to charge the other model unless it is switched off and connected for a day.\nAnother important factor is that different devices will regulate how they draw power for charging differently. One way people often get caught out is that they will use a charger to charge a device that draws power more quickly than the charger was really designed to do. This seems to work fine, but after a while what happens is the charger itself dies because it's been used too often to charge that particular device.\nAnother way people get caught out is they connect a charger which has the wrong voltage, because it is close to the correct voltage. However, if the device is using that charger as it's main power source the risk of damaging the device is pretty high. It's just not worth the risk!\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*This question may be of interest\n\n*Some chargers will be switchable (e.g. they can automatically switch voltages etc) and, in rare situations you can manually switch the voltage/wattage of a charger. However, I have not seem one on the market in recent times so do not know how readily available these are.\n\n\nA: This answer is indented to be canonical answer for similar questions and applies to all devices that utilize USB (Type A or C) chargers and conform to the USB Power Delivery specification (version 2.x through 3.x). \n\nIf there is only the MacBook 12 inch USB-C charger nearby, can it be used to charge other USB-C devices, such as any Android phones that also use USB-C? (will it be \"too powerful\" and damage other devices?)\n\nYes, it can be used and you will not cause any damage.\nUSB-C conforms to the USB 3.1 specification.  Part of that specification is the Power Delivery spec.  This means that the device and charger will negotiate the power that is delivered.\nAs to whether a charger is too powerful or not, you can always use a charger greater than or equal to the maximum power draw of the device.  This applies to all chargers (USB, barrel connector, etc.), not just those that conform to the USB 3.x specification.\nIn other words, if your Apple USB-C charger is capable of delivering 87W of power, but you only need 10W for your phone, you can charge your phone with no problem.\nHowever, your 10W phone charger should not be used to charge your 87W MacBook. Why?\n\n*\n\n*If it's USB 3.x (USB Type C), it will negotiate power.  Since it technically doesn't have enough, it will either charge slowly or not at all.\n\n*If it's USB 2.x (USB Type A) or a regular type charger, it will either not charge or have the possibility of damaging the charger because the draw of the device will exceed the charger's ability.\n\n(MagSafe power adapters have a chip built into it to prevent using an underpowered charger).\n\nVice versa, if there is a Quick Charge 2.0 or 3.0 USB-C charger from other devices nearby, can it be used to charge the Macbook 12 inch?\n\nPossibly.  The power delivery spec allows for power negotiation.  If there is sufficient power, it will charge, albeit slowly.  It may charge, but not power your device.  It may do nothing (it couldn't agree on a negotiated power delivery so it stopped delivering power).  If it's a poor quality charger (and does not conform to USB 3.0+ spec) it may overheat.\nThis is why you always use chargers greater than or equal to your device load.\n\nA: The macbook does not support quick charge 2.0/3.0. It supports USB PD (Power Delivery). With USB PD, both the charger and the charged device negotiate a voltage and amperage. If the charger can't supply a power profile amiable to the charged device, then charging won't occur. If you charge a USB PD device with a USB PD charger, then you aren't going to hurt the device or the charger. The macbook power supply supports USB PD and can be used to charge other USB PD compatible devices. I have charged my google pixel with my 2016 macbook pro power supply (87w).\nI have a 15\" 2016 mbp with usb-c. I've charged it with my Pixel charger (15w) just fine. Under light use, I can use my laptop and charge the laptop at the same time. \n\nA: Short answer, I tried it with my Google Pixel C and it works fine. Also, check out: http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-usb-c-macbook-and-laptop-chargers/. Resist the FUD.\n\nA: In general you should be fine. In cases if it is not going to work, you will immediately know when you check the battery status in settings of your Android phone. It will usually say not charging. As other answers pointed out, if the device depends on QC 2 or 3 (marketed in different terms such as Motorola torboppwer) I found it not charging from MacBook Pro charger.\nI tried following phones with my macbook pro USB c charger\nSamsung Galaxy note 8 - works\nGoogle pixel 3 - works \nMoto g6 - doesn't work \n\nA: Ok so, my macbook charger is bent so I have to use an android charger.\nBasically its fine, but it doesn't charge quickly, and the battery can go down and up when using the charger. It works best when the macbook is off, so I'd say if you are using one for your macbook, charge it for a few hours at a time while its off.

But still usb.h can't be seen, although I know where it is (under /usr/local/Cellar/usblib-compat/version/include).\nI read a lot over the Internet and tried to set many environment variables, but no success. Any idea?\nUPDATE\nAfter many trials, I have progressed somehow. Namely, the file config.mk is clearly read during the make'ing process, although I have to admit that it is not clear to me how this is done; anyway, I noticed two lines commented:\nCPPFLAGS += -I/usr/local/include\nLDFLAGS += -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-R/usr/local/lib\n\nI uncommented them and now something happens: the usb.h is found. I think the first of these variable definitions tells the compiler where to look tor header files, and the second tells the linker where to look for libraries - but again it is not completely clear to me.\nIn any case, I have still problems. Namely, the make'ing process outputs two warnings and an error, and then stops:\nusb-device.c:90:57: warning: unused parameter 'udev' [-Wunused-parameter]\nstatic void usb_reattach_kernel_driver(usb_dev_handle * udev, int interface) {\n                                                        ^\nusb-device.c:90:67: warning: unused parameter 'interface' [-Wunused-parameter]\nstatic void usb_reattach_kernel_driver(usb_dev_handle * udev, int interface) {\n\nusb-device.c:324:13: error: use of undeclared identifier 'RTLD_DEFAULT' if ( dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, \"libusb_init\") )\n\nSeems this program is difficult to port from Linux to Mac, although I think it should be portable. If anyone has any idea about what to do (apart from running a Linux distribution...), it would be much appreciated.\n\nA: You haven't told which program you want to compile, so it is impossible to give specific advice. \nThe general advice is to look at the program's README's, documentation and/or Makefile for ways to specify the include path.\nFor example you might edit the Makefile directly to identify where the include path is specified. In many projects the program is compiled by gcc/llvm and the include paths are specified using \"-I\" arguments to the compiler.\nYou could find that spot in the Makefile and add:\n  -I/usr/local/Cellar/usblib-compat/version/include\n\n", "Q: Downloading iOS music from iTunes onto iPad without being erased My dad bought me ed Sheeran new album on his iTunes so now we want to get it on my iPad. I have my own Apple ID account but I haven't bought any music. \nHow can I download the album my Dad bought to my iPad without deleting anything on it?\n\nA: I think you can download it on your computer, then sync with iTunes your music by activating Manually manage music and videos on your device's options.\nThat will allow you to just drag and drop music to your device without deleting anything on it.\nSource: Apple Support\n", "Q: Apps folder: View settings are always being reset I have a small problem with my apps folder (/Applications/).\nWhenever I change the view settings, for example, the size of the text, and click \"Use as standard\", it works fine.\nBut after some time, definitely after reboot or logout, those settings are not applied anymore and the old, ugly style is being used.\nI heard that the file .DS_Store contains these settings. There is none in my apps folder, so I created one, but it didn't even save, no warning or error was given.\nIn all other folders, this works fine.\nDoes anybody have an idea to make my apps folder to stick to the chosen view settings permanently?\n\nA: Finder view settings are stored in invisble .DS_Store files, in the parent of the folder being set. So the settings for /Applications are stored in /.DS_Store, and /Applications/.DS_Store holds the settings for subfolders of /Applications, such as /Applications/Utilities.\nNormally you have write permission to these files in one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*For system folders such as /Applications, the .DS_Store files have\nwrite access for members of the admin group, i.e. administrators.\n\n*For folders that you create, you are the owner of the .DS_Store file.\n\n\nThe problem is that the permissions can get screwed up. One way is via the macOS Migration Assistant: the migration changes the permissions on some .DS_Store files to be owned by root, but with no write access granted to the admin group.  This results in the symptoms you describe.\nA fix is to first run this command:\n sudo find -x / -name .DS_Store -user root -exec chmod -v g+w {} \\;\n\nwhich will give the group write access to any .DS_Store files owned by root.\nThat still won't fix all of the files; there may be a few stragglers (such as, /.DS_Store) where the migration has changed the file to the wrong group, such as wheel instead of admin. You can fix that with the chgrp command, e.g.:\n sudo chgrp admin /.DS_Store\n\n\nA: First of all, Finder uses a binary file format for this and you can't create the .DS_Store file yourself. Only Finder can do that (and usually will create it after you have first accessed the folder).\nIn case of the /Applications folder, it might be that you don't have administrator privileges which might prevent saving the .DS_Store file.\nSo you should check the permissions on this folder and set it to writeable by your user. This is not possible however if you're not the owner of your system.\nI've searched the net and found other people having similar problems like you. \nFirst thing suggested was to delete the Finder permissions file:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\ncan you try to do that, then logout/reboot and tell me in a comment if the view settings persist?\nEdit: even if you're currently the only user, it's possible that your computer had previous (now deleted users) with the admin rights set for some folders on your system including the /Applications folder. You then need to set the rights to your user. Usually changing the permission modes should not be necessary.\n", "Q: When using Numbers app, is there a setting to create a new column when user presses tab? When you are navigating in Numbers, pressing the tab key will take you to the next cell to the right and allows you to start typing. Very quick and helpful for data entry. When the user reaches the last column, pressing tab has no effect. In MS Excel, pressing tab in the final column will create a new column and allow the user to continue.\nIs it possible to do the same in numbers or is there always a break in workflow to stop and create new columns manually? Same question applies for enter but for rows. In excel, pressing enter in the final row will add a new row and let the user continue.\n\nA: To add a row above the selected cells use the Option+Up Arrow command. \nTo add a row below the selected cells use the Option+Down Arrow command.\nTo add a column to the right of the selected cells use the Option+Right Arrow command.\nTo add a column to the left of the selected cells use the Option+Left Arrow command.\nOn an iPad you can use the next buttons found on the screen\n\n", "Q: Save Excel file as pipe-delimited values file I know that you can save an Excel spreadsheet as a CSV file and that this will put quotes around any fields that have commas in them.

I need an Excel solution due to limitations on my machine.\nRunning version 15.27.\n\nA: While I don't know how to use the pipe character | can I suggest you use \"Tab-Delimited Text\" which is one of the \"Specialty Formats\" listed under \"Save As...\".\nThen if you wish you can use tr to change the tabs to pipes. tr '\\t' '\\|' < file.txt > file_converted.txt at the command line.\nNote that most software that exports CSV files (including Excel) wraps a field with a comma in it in quotes (as you mention above). Also note that most software that imports CSV files can usually also perform the unwrap. Finally, you may well find that whatever you are doing with the exported file is perfectly happy with tab-delimited text.\n", "Q: Can I stop predictive typing from suggesting emojis?

I recently bought an iPod Touch 6 and synced my entire music library, but some of my albums are not showing up under the artist. For instance, I would click on Demi Lovato, and a couple of her albums will be there, but other ones won't be. If I search for those albums, they're on the iPod, it's just really frustrating that they're not sorted with the artist. \nI've noticed that the albums I'm having an issue are albums that I originally ripped from CD's, but I don't think that's the reason because if it was, I'd be having trouble with a LOT more albums than I am. (Right now I'm only having trouble with three albums that I've noticed, but there might be more I haven't discovered yet. My music library is pretty substantial)\nAny help would be much appreciated!\n\nA: This may or may not help you, but I actually had the same problem.  Which lead me to this page because I did a Google search.\nI had an artist with 11 albums in iTunes.  But on my iPod it only showed 10 albums.  However, when I searched for specific tracks on the \"missing\" album they would show up and play fine.\nI messed around with iTunes a little and followed the other answer's suggestion.  I selected the album in artists view, right clicked on the album art (this will open up the properties for the entire album, not for a specific song.  You can also make changes and apply them to the entire album rather than having to go song by song).\nAt the bottom of the window there is a box \"Album is a compilation of songs by various artists.\"  Somehow, that was checked.  Which is odd because way back when I started ripping my CDs to iTunes I would let iTunes download the information for the CDs from their database.  Anyway, I unchecked that, synced the iPod again, and the 11th album showed up under the artist.\n\nA: A potential issue is that the artist name isn't exactly the same (maybe just an extra space etc), could be something else though.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes on your computer\n\n*Highlight the affected songs (one artist at a time)\n\n*Right click on one of them, and select \"Get Info\". \n\n*Ensure that the spelling of the artist name is exactly the same as it is for the songs that show up properly.

My requirement is to be able to drag a folder from my desktop to my Terminal app. To do this, I must minimize all other panels except the Terminal.\nThe beginning status:\n\nThe result:\n\nSo, if I minimize the panels one by one, it can be very time consuming. Is there a quicker way to achieve this?\n\nA: With the active application, at the bottom of the application menu itself, you should have a number of options you can use, namely: Hide Application Name; Hide Others; and, Show All.\nOn an English keyboard you can use the following shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*commandH to Hide Application Name\n\n*optioncommandH to Hide Others\n\n\nI'm not sure if it will be the same for you.\nRegardless, using the example in your question, the simplest workflow to achieve what you want would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (to make Terminal the active app)\n\n*In the menu bar go to Terminal > Hide Others (to hide everything else, including the Finder's open windows)\n\n*Drag folder over to Terminal\n\n\nBy doing the first two steps you're basically making the Desktop visible, which is where your folder is, while also keeping the Terminal app open.\nOf course, you should also be able to do the first two via keyboard shortcuts of some kind.\nNOTE: - Once you're done, you can make all the Finder windows visible again simply by returning to the Finder. This works because you didn't actually minimise the windows to begin with.\n\nA: Monomeeth's answer is absolutely correct, but in the interest of providing alternatives, I have a functionally similar requirement fairly regularly and my approach is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press F11/whatever shortcut you have defined for 'Show desktop'\n\n*Grab the required file from the desktop with the mouse (click and hold)\n\n*Press F11/shortcut for 'show desktop' again.\n\n*Drop grabbed file into the destination window.\n\n\nFor me, this has the advantage of leaving any other windows/apps visible after I've finished grabbing the file I need. \n", "Q: Is it possible to take multiple, continuous photos with a delay in iPhone?

In order to see it, go to the Finder and while you press and hold the option key, click on the Go menu and select Library from the drop-down menu.\n\n*In your case it may not be in the 'V2' folder - it could be in a 'V3' etc, but in Mavericks the default was 'V2' and in macOS Sierra it should be 'V4'.\n\n\nMethod 1 - copy the SyncedRules.plist file\nThis is what I'm guessing you've already tried. Namely, find the correct copy of your rules .plist file and copy/restore this across to the correct location within your new macOS Sierra location. By correct location I mean that in macOS Sierra there will probably be a new 'V4' folder - so copy the file into that folder!\nMethod 2 - create a new user account\nThis method involves creating a new user account but not enabling iCloud in it so you can access all your old rules.\nMore specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Select Users & Groups\n\n*Create a new User Account (you may need to unlock the padlock in order to do this)\n\n*In Login Options ensure you have Automatic Login set to off, and that you have Show fast user switching menu enabled\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n*Log into your new user account but do not log in to iCloud (i.e. totally skip this step)\n\n*Copy across your V2 or V3 etc folder into the Mail folder located within the user's library folder (see notes at beginning of answer on how to make the library folder visible)\n\n*Now open Mail\n\n*This should start a process to copy across all your Mail data from the V2 or V3 or V4 etc folder you copied across\n\n\nOnce finished, you should be able to see your rules etc. If you can, you can try to copy across this new folder to your other user's account (however, be aware this may not be preferable as you will replace existing data that may be more recent - although you could try just copying across the SyncedRules.plist file. Remember to copy it across to the correct location (see Method 1 above).

The prerequisite is that you do have a backup of your system before the upgrade wiped your rules.\nThe key point here is that if you have iCloud turned on (which most users probably do) your Mail rules are synced with iCloud by default. The solution with creating new user is too long and much of a hassle. Do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail.\n\n*Open iCloud Preferences (System Preferences → iCloud)\n\n*Open options for iCloud Drive as shown below:\n\n\n*Make sure you uncheck Mail from the list of apps that store data in iCloud:\n\n\n*Find your Mail rules file in your backup, the file you're looking for is ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/SyncedRules.plist (folder name could be different depending on your backuped system, \"V2\" is for Mavericks, \"V3\" is for El Cap, \"V4\" is for Sierra)\n\n*Copy that file over to your current system, into: ~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData/ (again, V4 beacuse it's assumed you're on Sierra)\n\n*Now, open Mail, go to Preferences → Rules, and you will see all rules back in place, however all disabled.

I wanted to create a new user/group with ID 82 but it's already exists – _clamav:_clamav. As I understand it's some kind of antivirus engine. Is it safe to add myself to this group?\n\nA: For your purposes, it's best not to add yourself to an existing group.\nTo discover what groups are on your computer you will find most listed in /etc/group - less /etc/group will give it to you. You can create a new group by adding it to this list. man group will explain the format of this file. I usually create a group with an id from 600 to 699. Apple seems to use ids above 700 for special groups not listed in /etc/group.\nTo discover what groups you are already a member of you can use the groups command. To list the ids of the groups you are a member of you can use the command id -G.\n", "Q: What do \"Mac Ads Cleaner\" and \"Mac App Cleaner\" do while installed?

People are so used to updating Flash every other day, so a web site offering an upgrade doesn't set off any alarms.\nThe programs that got installed are search hijackers. They bring up pages offering other fake programs, or even send you to a page that insists you have a virus, which includes a handy 800 number to call to remove it.

It will scan for and remove the remnants of those junk apps.\nNext time you get a prompt to update Flash, use the applet in System Preferences or get the update direct from adobe.com.

The INS key is not found in the built-in keyboard, so I think there must be some other way to toggle this function!\nTo avoid any misunderstanding, you can see the keys found in the Italian built-in keyboard in the picture here:\n\nI tried so many combinations, but none of these works:\n\n\n*\n\n*FnEnter⏎ (it just produces a new line)\n\n*FnM (it just types an \"m\")\n\n*FnI\n\n*ControlT\nAnd many more (for instance some combinations mentioned here: How do I simulate the Insert key in Windows on a MacBook Pro?)\nDo you have any suggestions? This is driving me crazy, any help would be much appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: If your purpose is simply to have the overwrite feature in Word for Mac or its free clones, then you can activate it inside the app and go to Tools > Customize Keyboard >  Commands and select \"Overtype\" and set whatever keyboard shortcut you want for it.\n\nA: I found this answer on the Apple Discussion Forums.  Basically, you need to remap another key to be the insert key.  To do this, you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Karabiner.  You may be able to use Karabiner Elements (Free) to do this, but the software is limited.\n\n*XML configuration files to remap the key(s)\n\nFollowing  are a couple sample XML configurations.\nRemap the § key (UK keyboard) to ShiftCommandU:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?> \n<root>\n   <item>\n   <name>Make § Key Insert Key</name>\n   <identifier>private.section_to_insert</identifier>\n   <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::UK_SECTION, KeyCode::U, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</autogen>\n   </item>\n</root>\n\nRemap the § key (UK keyboard) to PC Insert:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>    \n<root>\n<item>\n    <name>Make § Key Insert Key</name>\n    <identifier>private.section_to_insert</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::UK_SECTION, KeyCode::PC_INSERT</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nYou will have to select a key that you don't use (or use very seldom) to remap to.

I want to keep syncing WiFi passwords through keychain, but I want to keep my iPhone off specific WiFi network, which I must use on my work Mac. How do I do this?\n\nA: If you have admin control of the wifi network (or can contact who does), you could have your iPhone's MAC address blocked from the network with MAC Address filtering...\nHowever this may (or may not, totally theoretical) impact your iPhone's battery life if the phone starts repeatedly trying to join the network when in range. Like I said, it might not, I'm not sure what it's behaviour would be if the network told it to sod off when joining :)\nDepending on the network setup, when you tap the little (i) next to the network name, you can  turn off a option called \"Auto-Join\". So the keychain retains the network details, but does not join the network unless you tap on it. I think this is a setting enabled by RADIUS enabled networks or networks added to the device by a Profile though, I've never figured out why some networks show it and some do not.\n\nA: On your iPhone, go to Settings > WiFi. Then tap the (i) button beside the network you don't want it to access anymore. At the top of your screen will be a blue \"Forget This Network\". Tap that and tap \"Forget\" to confirm your choice.\nYour Mac should still remember the network and join it freely, but your iPhone should no longer join it.\nIf your iPhone keeps joining the network after doing the above, be sure to enable the option for \"Ask to Join Networks\" (at the bottom of the screen in Settings > WiFi).\n", "Q: Adobe CS5 compatibilty with new OS on iMac I have an iMac running OS X 10.6.8. I need to update the operating system as I can't update search engines etc. but am worried if I do CS5 Adobe suite won't run (I also have Microsoft 2008). I need both for my job.\nHappy to update to not the latest OS, but just enough to make sure I can access the web (already can't do Linkedin). \nWhat should I do? Thanks!\n\nA: If you are running 10.6.8, you have at least an Early 2006 iMac (but not earlier because that would make it a G5 which renders this whole thing moot).  It also can't be any later than a Late-2009 since that was the last model that could support 10.6.x\nIf it's a 2006, you are pretty much dead in the water so to speak and it's time to buy a new iMac because the most you are going to upgrade to is 10.7.5\nSo, I am going on the assumption that you have a 2007 or later iMac....\n\nYou are right on the cusp of being able to upgrade to macOS Sierra if you have a 2009 (macOS Sierra How to Upgrade).  However, I don't recommend you going that far.  In my personal experience, the problems associated with Sierra have far outweighed any potential benefits I never needed in the first place so I advise skipping or waiting out this version.\nRegardless, you must upgrade to El Capitan first; just stay here for now.\nAs for CS5, there's not too many known issues, but generally it appears that it works.  Though CS5 is 7 years old, so, it's highly unlikely you will find very much way in the development of \"fixes\" for any outstanding issues.\n\nHappy to update to not the latest OS, but just enough to make sure I can access the web (already can't do Linkedin). What should I do? Thanks!\n\nSince your particular iMac (assumed) is capable of running El Capitan, I would suggest only a couple of hardware upgrades:\n\n\n*\n\n*Max out memory (depending on your model, this can go from 6GB to 32GB)\n\n*Add an SSD (I personally use and recommend the Samsung 850 EVO; I use it in my iMac)\n\n*Do a full Time Machine backup and do a fresh clean install (preferably on the new SSD) to ensure you are starting from \"factory.\"\n\n\nifixit.com has an excellent guide for opening your machine (the 2007 - 2011 iMac's used magnets to hold the display in so removal is actually fairly easy)\nBottom Line:  As long as your iMac is at least from 2007 onward, you have a bit more life that can be extracted from your machine as it supports at least El Capitan.  A few dollars spent on upgrading your hardware will speed things up and breathe new life into it.\n", "Q: Send file using wifi to my MacBook while connected to wi-fi just a quick question. \nI've got a MacBook Air and I'm a journalist, I need the SD Card slot.\nI've to switch to the new MacBook Pro and I will lose the SD Card, so I'm trying to solve the issue.\nI'm planning to use a wireless SD Card (Transcend) and a ruby script on my MacBook that looks for new files on the card and download them on a folder on my Mac. \nHere is the issue: everything is ok if I connect to the wi-fi hotspot created by the transcend, but of course I must connect to the wifi of the event / venue so I cannot lose the wifi connection.\nAt this moment I'm using the iPhone as camera and AirDrop: I can send photos to my Mac without any issue to the wi-fi connection: my Macbook receive images while connected to the wi-fi.\nIs there a way to create a virtual wi-fi interface that looks for the Transcend SSID, connect to the card and download images?\nI can also use a EyeFi card that act as a server, and the server is another script that runs on my Mac. This doesn't solve the problem: is my MacBook is connected to the network I cannot use the access point mode so the EyeFi can't connect.\nAny idea? AirDrop work in that wy, but I cannot understand how can I create a sort of \"airdrop\" tunnel to connect to my card\n\nA: In my suggestion, instead of finding one virtual interface why not you add option in your script itself to associate with Transcend before transfer and when its done it comes back to your original network.\nTo do this, you just add below given commands to your script. \n\n\n*\n\n*Whenever script finds a new file, it force to associate the Transcend's    SSID (I assume your Mac is already associated to Venue's Wi-Fi)\nnetworksetup -setairportnetwork en0 Transcend_SSID PASSWORD\n\n*This command will force to associate with Transcend's SSID.\n\n*Check the association\nnetworksetup -getairportnetwork en0\n\n*Once Transfer is done remove the Transcend SSID from the network and toggle the Wi-Fi power.\nnetworksetup -removepreferredwirelessnetwork en0 Transcend_SSID\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\n*According to Wi-Fi property it will associate back to your venue's Wi-Fi.\nI think it might be helpful to you. It will break your connectivity with Venue's Wi-Fi for very less time as script is always running in background.

I recommend you contact NS&I and tell them about it.\nMeanwhile, tap the Share button on the top-right and select `Request Desktop Site'.

However, you will need to restore the in-app purchase on all devices you didn't originally use to make the purchase.\nTo do this, you will need to navigate around the app and look for an option labelled something like restore in-app purchases (or similar). Many apps will put this option within their own settings page, but I can't advise you exactly where it will be for this app (as I don't personally use it).\nIf you can't find an option anywhere to restore the in-app purchase, I would go to their dedicated iOS forum page and ask for help.\n", "Q: How to find what ctrl+alt+up/down is mapped to?

I'd like to know if there's a permanent fix for this, otherwise I'll be dealing with my encrypted volumes on a Win 10 VM (when VM Fusion works, anyway...yeesh). \n\nA: The following script from this link fixes the problem:\nhttps://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/315\nI called this kextclean:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction status() {\n    kextstat | grep org.virtualbox.kext > /dev/null 2>&1 ;\n    vbox=$((1-$?))\n    kextstat | grep com.github.osxfuse > /dev/null 2>&1 ;\n    fuse=$((1-$?))\n}\n\nstatus\n\nif [ \"$1\" == \"vbox\" ] ; then\n    if [ $vbox == 1 ] ; then\n    echo \"Already vbox\"\n    else\n        sudo kextunload -b com.github.osxfuse.filesystems.osxfuse\n        sudo kextutil \"/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/VBoxDrv.kext\" -r \"/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox\"\n        sudo kextutil \"/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/VBoxNetAdp.kext\" -r \"/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox\"\n        sudo kextutil \"/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/VBoxNetFlt.kext\" -r \"/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox\"\n        sudo kextutil \"/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/VBoxUSB.kext\" -r \"/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox\"\n    fi\nelif [ \"$1\" == \"fuse\" ] ; then\n    if [ $fuse == 1 ] ; then\n    echo \"Already fuse\"\n    else\n        sudo kextunload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetFlt -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetAdp\n        sudo kextunload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv\n        sudo kextutil /Library/Filesystems/osxfuse.fs/Contents/Extensions/10.12/osxfuse.kext\n    fi\nelif [ \"$1\" == \"status\" ] ; then\n    echo \"vbox = $vbox\"\n    echo \"fuse = $fuse\"\nelse\n    echo \"Run $0 <vbox|fuse|status>\"\nfi\n\n\n\nA: The command\nsudo kextutil /Library/Filesystems/osxfuse.fs/Contents/Extensions/10.12/osxfuse.kext\n\ndid fix the problem. TrueCrypt is working again.\n\nA: TLDR: restarting my Mac got rid of the \"mount_osxfuse: the file system is not available (255)\" error for me.\nI have TrueCrypt 7.1.x but I also installed VeraCrypt 1.21 for continuity. VC requires OSXFUSE 2.5, but I had OSXFUSE <2.5 and so I hit 'upgrade' within System Preferences, to what turned out to be 3.7.1. When I did this, I saw a flavor of the \"mount_osxfuse: the file system is not available (255)\" error when trying to mount with either VeraCrypt or with TrueCrypt.\nThe upgrade may be a coincidence, but I had also hit 'Eject' using Finder on my Volume, which I think may have caused the problem. \nThe intended use is to \"Dismount\" within TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt instead. Oops. But after restarting, all was well. That's about all the investigating I did.\n", "Q: My Apple devices always seem to slow down over the years It seems like every time I buy an Apple product the speed of it always slows down. I bought an iPod a year or two ago and the speed at which it launches apps and runs the apps have slowed down. Is there any way to fix this? Like buy an iPhone and it will never slow down?\n\nA: You have several options to fight against the slackening of your devices (or the perception of it):\n\n\n*\n\n*don't install apps (especially apps bloating over time because of feature updates)\n\n*don't use faster and newer devices of the same kind (or better: the older your own devices get, ask friends or colleagues to lend to you their much older and slower devices more frequently and use them and you will happily return to your own \"faster\" device)\n\n*get old faster than your devices (or reduce the perception of speediness or responsiveness artificially)\n\n*take Zen lessons\n\n\nA: In addition to what klanomath suggests, another option is to do a full backup, erase, and restore.\nBy this I mean do a full backup to iTunes on your computer. Once you've done this, go to your iPod and do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on Settings\n\n*Tap on General\n\n*Swipe up\n\n*Tap on Reset\n\n*Tap on Erase All Content and Settings\n\n*Enter your passcode to go through the process\n\n*Reconnect your iPod to iTunes on your computer\n\n*Opt to restore the backup you made earlier\n\n\nThis process should improve your iPod's responsiveness etc\n", "Q: Why are my passwords copied to the \"Local Objects\" keychain after using AutoFill? What is \"Local Objects\" after all? I am thinking about using Keychain to store all my passwords, but am hesitant as I do not seem to fully understand how Keychain works.\nI created a new keychain holding login credentials for some websites. Using Safari, I made use of the AutoFill feature, granting access to the keychain.\nNow the credentials that have been used for AutoFill have been copied to a keychain called \"Local Objects\".\n\n\n*\n\n*What is this Local Objects keychain and why are my passwords copied into it?\n\n*Why are they already entries in the keychain belonging to Apple (like com.apple.account.SMTP.asynchost) – is this related to Keychain being deeply integrated into macOS?\n\n*Does this have any negative security implications, or: Should I care about this behavior?\n\n\nA: To my knowledge, this is to put anything that can be synced with iCloud Keychain in a separate keychain. It is still technically part of the login.keychain, but kind of \"partitioned\" away in case you turn on iCloud Keychain and start syncing these items.\nA lot of computer specific things are kept separate in the main login.keychain because having those show up on another Mac/iOS Device would cause it to misbehave since it is a physically different machine.\nThis is just based on my observation of macOS keychain. It only only started doing this when iCloud Keychain was introduced, and all the items in this second keychain will appear on other Macs and iOS Devices if iCloud Keychain is turned on. This second keychain changes it's name to \"iCloud\" when iCloud Keychain is enabled.\n", "Q: Store iTunes library on network drive, keep local cache of some media for offline use, and let iTunes organize media on network drive I have a relatively large iTunes library, a Macbook Pro laptop with a relatively small SSD, and a Linux box with plentiful storage space that is always connected to the internet. I have a dream that one day I will be able to store my iTunes library on the Linux box as a network drive, keep a hand-curated list of songs and podcasts cached on my laptop, and still allow iTunes to organize my media library on the network drive. (Specifically, I want to use the 'Keep iTunes Media folder organized' and 'Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library' options in iTunes so that I can drag-and-drop files into iTunes, have iTunes organize copies via ID3 info, and delete the original files.)\nThe last time I tried to tackle this problem was ~2 years ago. From what I can recall, my best attempt was a continuously running script that checked if the network drive was accessible and if so, it mounted the network drive where iTunes was set to look for media, and otherwise it moved or mounted (I forget which) a local directory with hand-copied media there instead. I forget exactly why this solution was causing me headaches but obviously it does sound terribly kludgy and I did give up on it. At the time I was trying this, iTunes would not follow symlinks to find media so mounting was necessary.\nLately I've \"sucked it up\" and stored all my iTunes media on my laptop but right now I'm feeling renewed vigor for solving this problem. Needed clarifications? Thoughts?\n\nI'll try to work on this myself over the next week and update if I think I have new ideas on a good solution. \nFor this question, I don't want to insist on exactly how iTunes should behave if I attempt to add media while my laptop is offline. Ideally, iTunes would prevent that and display an error message but if that's not feasible and I just need to remember to not do that, it's not a dealbreaker.\nRelated questions:\nSplitting an iTunes Library [duplicate]\niTunes videos on a different harddrive?\nA REAL iTunes server on NAS\nI don't want to split my iTunes library so this question is a bit different from the ones above. I want the Linux box to have a master copy of all my iTunes media.\nSolutions need not be limited to configuration within iTunes. Solutions that \"trick\" iTunes -- such as how I suggested above by selectively mounting drives to the iTunes media directory -- are fair game. Thanks for reading!\n\nEdit: I promised to update after a week. Currently, I do not have interesting progress to report.\n\nA: I'm using Supersync on multiple macs that's based on my qnap nas that keeps track of everything -- from \"cloud/not on this machine\" \"on thismsachine:notonserver\" etc.\nIt also handles dupes, missing tracks, various library issues -- and even better fixes them easily.\nI'm not shilling for them -- I have some problems with its quirks -- but with 4 machines, 15 years of iTunes and now a ton of other media that would dwarf my drive it does the trick.\nHope this helps...\n", "Q: Notifications showing no content Whenever I get notifications, there is no content, or the content that should be there.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In the News notifications and Google notifications, it only shows bold text, not any details like it should.\n\n*In WhatsApp notifications, it shows the name of the person and the group, but for the content it just shows \"(null)\".\n\n*For emails, it just shows the name of the sender, and shows \"Mail message\" underneath it.\n\n*For texts from the stock messages app, it just shows the sender's name and \"iMessage\" underneath it instead of showing the messages content.\n\n\nHow do I fix this and make notifications show the content properly?

What is this and should I transfer it? I am restoring from a Time Machine backup. Along with Applications, my user directory, and a few other expected things, I see an item called \"MacPorts\", which has a size of Zero KB.\n\nI have no idea what this is or if I did anything over the 8 years I've had my old Mac that would have created it. What is it and should I transfer it?\n\nA: MacPorts (a package manager similar to homebrew or Fink) creates an additional user with the name MacPorts/macports and a group with the name macports. Usually the UID(MacPorts) is the last regular user's UID+1 and the GID=UID(MacPorts).\nAfter a normal OS X install this is 502/502 (if only one user is configured = admin) or 503/503 (if two users are present = admin and standard user).\nThough the user has a non-system-user UID (>500), the account isn't visible in the Users & Groups System Preferences because it is marked as disabled. Time Machine/Migration Assistant still recognizes it.\nIf you don't use MacPorts anymore, you can safely ignore the account and uncheck the checkmark.\n", "Q: Why is my Mac listening on port 625? My Mac is listening on port 625. This listing by Apple of common ports used by macOS and Apple software claims that it has something to do with Open Directory.

Wish the iPhone would automatically cycle the wireless antennae when this kind of thing happens…but at least I don't have to wait hours for all my iCloud content to re-sync.\n\nA: SOLUTION\nok after months of this on occasionally then off mostly and sat with the waiting. I found the solution\nVPN, do you have any VPN like expressvpn or similar on your mac, if so turn it off and voila .\n\nA: I solved this by switching one device to a different wifi \"router\". I have 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz channels on my router, so I just connected my Mac to the 5Ghz and iPhone to 2.4Ghz, and then suddenly I got like 10 copies of the files I was trying to transfer.\nNothing else worked. Rebooting didn't work. Toggling Wifi on and off didn't work. Just this.\n\nA: Another possibility is that the firewall blocks the transfer.\nMake sure that sharingd is allowed to receive incoming connections.\n\nA: Airdrop can be very frustrating when it does not work as expected or seem to work randomly.\nI think i messed up with the firewall a few times ago and somes rules obviously messed up with Airdrop.\nIn my case the Graal finally came when i installed Murus ( https://www.murusfirewall.com/murus/ same devs from IceFloor ) it allows you to interact with PF ( Packet Filter ) which is the native OS X firewall.\nIn Murus, i did \"Load Selected Profile\" with \"Less restrictive\" in the \"Assistant\" tab, then click the play icon on the top left and voilà ! Miracle happened !\nPS : the Murus Lite (free) edition is enough for this manipulation\n\nA: Together with the VPN that is stopping Airdrop, also the Mac Firewall turned ON can be the reason for this problem.\nBy turning it OFF for a moment it is possible to make Airdrop work. This can be configured in System Preference > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Turn Off Firewall.\nAlternatively, instead of turning Firewall OFF you can just allow incoming connection for the sharingd service.\n\nA: For me, powering off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios, and resetting bluetoothd usually fixes things without requiring a reboot.

However, yet I can charge the Mac after its battery shows 15%.\nSo, is being always in sleep mode a weakening it's battery life? and does it hurt the logic board, honestly?              \n\nA: I've had my MacBook Pro for 6 years now and I barely turned it off over that period.

Saw dust built up at the bottom vent of the Time Capsule (vertical model). Blew air in it to extract the dust from the other side of the vent. However I then noticed that some went back inside the unit (had the TC upside down for this).\nAfter some research to see how it's made inside, I saw that there is 2 areas, one for the wifi components and one with the fan unit attached to the power supply.\nI can't open it to clean it (no tools, no expertise).\nMy question: If some dust patches went inside near the wifi board or near the fan/power supply area, is this a risk for fire or any other risk ? Or is general dust build up in a computing unit not a concern in general ?\n\nA: In terms of being a fire risk, no, dust building up inside a Time Capsule is not a concern.\nDepending on the hardware, dust can be a concern for other reasons. In the early days of computing when floppy disks were the main storage medium, we used to have a saying that getting dust onto the disk was like running into a brick wall - not good at all.\nHowever, I have worked on countless computers over the past three decades and they're usually full of dust inside (well, in tower models at least). None of these machines have ever caught fire. \nWith regard to a Time Capsule, they do not generate a lot of heat - much less than a computer with multi-core processors doing some heavy processing tasks. So you can rest easy.\n", "Q: Capacitor discharge for replacing broken iMac power supply A friend has offered to give me an iMac (either 2009 0r 2012 model but I haven't seen it close up yet). It works, other than a broken power supply.\nThis ifixit page details the power supply replacement process:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iMac+Intel+21.5-Inch+EMC+2308+Power+Supply+Replacement/1771#s9148\nHowever, this guide warns you not to touch the exposed face of the power supply as the capacitors can shock you if they have retained a charge.\nNow I'm no stranger to the inside of a computer, but I haven't replaced a power supply with exposed capacitors before. So to avoid the risk altogether, how long would it take for the capacitors to discharge if it's simply left unplugged. How can I safely test for discharge with a multimeter?\n\nA: Usually, if the iMac lost power suddenly (e.g. pulling the AC plug from power while it's still switched on) you would need to allow some time for the capacitors to discharge before working on it. However, if the iMac was shut down properly (e.g. Apple > Shut Down) then it should discharge the power supply capacitor fairly quickly (not immediately, but close).\nTypically, the input capacitors on a computer power supply have between a 180 to 360 volt charge on them. How long they hold this charge depends on the circuit, but a bleeder resistor sits across them to dissipate this charge. \nRegardless, in your case it sounds as if the iMac hasn't been powered up for a while and the power supply isn't working. Of course, since it's broken (or faulty) there's always the potential for a problem. And, since you can't be 100% sure what the problem is, make sure there is no AC cable plugged in while working on it.\nTIP: DO NOT wear a watch, bracelet, necklace, etc (or any metallic objects) which could accidentally make contact with the power supply circuitry.\nRegarding the use of a multimeter, you could test across the capacitors with one. If you actually get a voltage reading then you could even use the multimeter in this way to discharge the capacitors slowly until the voltage reads zero. If you're wanting to use a multimeter to discharge, I'd recommend an analogue one as a high impedance digital meter would take a while to discharge.\nHowever, as I mentioned above, it sounds as if the iMac hasn't been powered up for a while, so you should be right to go.\n", "Q: Problems with temperature and Mac fan My Mac is showing lots of errors and running weirdly.

I can barely guess that \"sometimes\", the first number is the \"major\" version, eg. for Xcode, but that's not always true, eg. for iOS.\nAnd what's the middle letter about?\nThe last number surely is a sequential build number, with minor revisions having a lowercase letter appended (take iOS 10.3 beta).\nDo they all start at 1A1 internally, then move on build after build?\nWhat is the greater scheme at play here?\n\nA: Paul Suh (formerly a consulting engineer and training developer at Apple, wrote the following (published on Joe Moreno's blog):\n\nFor instance, Mac OS X 10.4.10 Intel is build 8R2232. Mac OS X Server\n  10.4.11 Universal is 8S2169. These numbers have the following rough meanings:\n8 - This is the major version number of the software package. 10.5 =\n  9, 10.4 = 8, ... 10.0 = 4. Prior to that was NextStep 3.3, from which\n  we get the 3 series.\nR - This is the minor version number. It is always incremented for\n  system updates (i.e. 10.4.10 to 10.4.11 is always a letter jump), but\n  may be incremented as well for hardware-specific builds. R is the 18th\n  letter, but only the 10th update to Tiger. The other 8 letter bumps\n  were for hardware support for new releases. Security updates generally\n  don't merit a letter bump.\n2232 - This is the sequential build number within the minor version.\n  If it is a four-digit number, the first digit indicates a specific\n  platform. In this case, 2 indicates that it is for Intel. A\n  three-digit or shorter number indicates a unified build for all\n  architectures. The remaining digits are the sequential build number.\n  In this case, the R train had 232 builds before release, the first one\n  being build 8R2001. Although the builds are roughly daily, you can't\n  really go by that number. In the early stages builds may only happen\n  once every two or three days; towards the end they may occur two or\n  three times a day. The build trains of successive releases may overlap\n  to a certain extent, based on what Apple Engineering sees as the\n  priority vs. risk of various changes to the code. The earliest builds\n  of 10.4.11 almost certainly overlapped with the last builds of\n  10.4.10. The builds of Leopard definitely overlapped with builds of Tiger updates, going back to almost all the way to the day after Tiger\n  was released.\nNote that different software packages have totally different build\n  numbers, so you can't compare the build numbers to each other in a\n  meaningful way. The exception is that Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server\n  share the same build numbers.\n\n\nA: In an article MacRumors refers to Apple's build number scheme. Although not an offical resource it does indicate there is a certain logic behind the numbering.\n\nAccording to Apple's build number scheme, \"13\" refers to OS X 10.9,\n  \"A\" refers to the 10.9.0 version, and \"451\" is part of a sequential\n  numbering of compiled builds.\n\n", "Q: Display Dock on the main screen on left when second screen is arranged to left I've this arrangment of screens, and I've set the dock to stay on the left side.\nThe problem is that the dock goes on the second screen, while i want to keep it on the main one (the one with the white bar basically). \nAny idea?\n\n\nA: With the screen arrangement below you can accomplish what you want. However, with this arrangement it is not that intuitive to move with the mouse from one screen to the other.

Any advice welcome to solve this...\n\nA: Your Arch Linux distribution probably contains an NFSv4 server. The NFSv4 server requires a base directory (e.g. /srv/nfs4).\nAny additional share has to be a subdirectory (e.g. /srv/nfs4/home_tmp). So move the server-side /home_tmp to the base directory.\nThe file /etc/exports looks like this then:\n/srv/nfsv4 192.168.0.0/26(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)\n/srv/nfsv4/home_tmp 192.168.0.0/26(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)\n\n(only tested with async but should also work with sync)\nReload the file with exportfs -arv on the server.\nYour client-side file /etc/auto_nfs has to be changed also:\n/home_tmp -fstype=nfs,vers=3,rw,resvport,tcp,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3 192.168.0.2:/srv/nfsv4/home_tmp\n\nFinally enter sudo automount -vc in the client's shell to \"refresh\" the mounted share.\n\nTo set up networked home directories for OS X users some directory integration is required or at least recommended (e.g. LDAP or AD). For Linux servers I've found a pretty old how-to: \nAutomount OS X Home Directories Using OpenLDAP and Linux. I don't know if the approach still works well with newer macOS versions. An updated how-to would require a new question here or at Server Fault. \n\nA: Turns out that this is a simple firewall issue. Fravadona's answer pointed me into the right direction. The IT department didn't know which port to open (111 was already open) and didn't have time to dig into it at the moment, so they extensively opened ports. They told me they will change firewalls in the near future and will have a detailed look when they are finished.

If I turn WiFi off and on again everything works again for a while then it stops and I have to turn wifi off/on again. So the loop takes place.\nI can't figure out what the problem is and isolate it, everything seems ok. I guess this is likely a network (router) problem, since it only happens at work, but my colleagues apparently don't have this problem. Plus, if it were a routing problem, why does everything works again after a simple wifi interface reconnection laptop side i.e. without doing anything router-side? \nEDIT:\nI've done some test and it turns out after apparently loosing connectivity to internet it's still possible to ping public hosts. So, I guess, network is up,  DNS work correctly, and the problem should be limited to http data forwarding on port 80 (so, likely a routing problem)\n\nA: Go to Network in System Preferences. Go to Advanced, and check the DNS Servers. You should have 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, add those if they are not on there. Now check if your ipv4 is set to DHCP, and turn off ipv6 if it is on.\n", "Q: Unable to download WhatsApp I have been trying without success to re-download WhatsApp and every time it says \"unable to download\". I am not sure if it's a space issue, I would think it would tell me I do not have enough available storage. I am using an iPhone 5c with iOS 10.2.1.\n\nA: 1) If the download has started and then the alert pops up: I have experienced this due to lack of network connections. Sometimes you're connected to WiFi, but there is actually no connection (for example you're connecting to a public WiFi and confirmation is needed). \nGo to Safari, type in Google.com and see if Google loads in the browser.

It replaces my 15\" 2015 rMBP. That system (the 2015 model) was the tail end of a chain of systems (some iMacs, some rMBPs) on which I had always done Migration Assistant to set up the new system. That system was also beginning to experience a lot of strange slow downs, beach balls, loud fan noise, etc. I suspect it's not the system hardware itself, but just years of junk piling up.\nSo, I'm starting fresh with my new system. I have everything set up pretty well and the new system is screaming fast. No beach balls or loud fan here yet!\nEverything in iCloud Drive, Google Drive, and Dropbox has downloaded without a hitch, and I'm getting all of my programs re-installed. So far so good.\nThe only deficiency I have come across is with respect to the Messages app on macOS. I sign in just fine, and sending/receiving new messages works perfectly, but it has none of my message history. I can kind of understand why this would be true for SMS (non-Apple messages), but I would expect iMessage entries to be backed up through iCloud and auto-restored. But nothing is showing up.\nI have seen several products online that tout the ability to export messages from an iPhone, which would work fine, since my iPhone 7 Plus has essentially all of the message history I care about. What is not clear, however, is exactly how this export process works. From what I can tell, most of these products do get the data off of the iPhone, but I want to then load/import the data into Messages for macOS, and it appears that most of these solutions just save the text message data into some kind of file (*.txt, *.pdf, etc.). I don't want to pay money for that kind of a solution.\nDoes anybody have experience with what I'm trying to do? I still have my old rMBP, so if there's any way to selectively back up just its Messages, and restore them to the new rMBP, that would work, too. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Per @Tetsujin's comment, I started down the path of what was linked. It didn't work, though. After transferring in the folders/files, Messages looked the same as before.\nIt got me looking for a similar answer, however, and I was able to come across this article on iMore.\nThe basic gist of the article is to copy the contents of ~/Library/Messages from the Old Mac into the same directory on the New Mac.\n[Insert standard \"back up your stuff before doing this!\" comment.]\nThen, I did a reboot (which I hadn't done with the prior attempt; maybe that was the difference).\nNote:\nThe iMore article seems to indicate that the \"Archive\" folder is only for conversations that have been closed, and only if you have the \"Save history when conversations are closed\" option checked. I did not have this option checked, and I rarely close conversations, and all of my conversations were there.\nNote 2:\nThe folders from the original answer in Tetsujin's comment were aliases, and I don't know if they are pointing to the folders in ~/Library/Messages, but – for whatever reason – iMore's solution worked! (Perhaps it was the recommended reboot found in iMore's article.)\n", "Q: I installed the Stamps.com Connect to my computer and I can't uninstall I installed the Stamps.com Connect to my OS X Macbook.

I have not been able to use the command key to drag the icon because that just opens it in the menu bar. In the applications file, it will not let me delete it because \"it is in use.\" I am at my wits end. Please help. Thanks!\n\nA: Your application is probably running in background, so you have to \"kill it\" before you can uninstall it.\nUsing Activity Monitor, find the Stamps.com Connect process and double click on it (using Acrobat as an example because I don't have Stamps.com; the process is the same, however).\n\nYou will then be presented with another dialog which will allow you to quit the running process:\n\nSelect \"Quit.\"\nYou should then be able to uninstall the software.

So, something happened while you were working that caused your hard drive to either stop spinning, or just to not be recognized by your system anymore.  \nOne option:\nUnless you have experience taking apart Macbooks, and have the appropriate drive sled to offload data from your (possibly) failing drive, I'd highly recommend taking it into a Mac service place so that they can copy the data off your drive before it completely fails (if it hasn't already). That's your best bet for data recovery.  While they've got it apart, they can put in a new drive (I'd recommend an SSD upgrade if you have a spinning disk currently, since it'll speed your machine WAY up).  \nThe other option is if you have another Mac and a thunderbolt (or firewire if this is an old mac) cable, you can try repeatedly rebooting while holding down the T-key. This boots into Firewire/Thunderbolt Target Disk Mode, which basically turns your laptop into an expensive external hard drive. When hard drives start to fail, occasionally you'll be able to reboot several times and they'll work again. Do that, and if/when it works, then plug into the other Mac and immediately copy off all of your most important files, followed by your less important files, since the drive could fail again at any time.  \nHope this helps and you can recover your data!  \n", "Q: Resizing preview pane in Finder column view When dragging the border of a Finder window in column view with preview visible to resize it, it seems arbitrary whether Apple will take or make space by adjusting the preview pane size or by showing more or less of the ancestor columns.\nIs there a way to resize just the preview pane? \nIs there a way to show more or less of the columns while keeping the size of the preview pane?\n\nA: Finder's column view can be a painful experience, which is why I seldom use it. I find if I resize the window by the bottom right corner (like all us old-timers grew up doing), the preview is on a one-way trip to thumbnail land. If you increase the window size, you get extra columns while the preview stays the same size. But if you then decrease the window size, it's the poor old preview that bears the brunt and shrinks in size. What a crazy state of affairs.\nA far easier way of previewing files is to just use Quick Look… Select one of the files and press spacebar. You can reposition and resize the preview to your heart's content, and the preview window updates as you navigate through your files.\nIf you really want to use column view to preview files in the same window, here's how you can resize the preview:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize the window down until you can only see the desired number of columns (minus the width of the preview column).\n\n*Scroll to the far right so you can see the preview again.\n\n*Hover the cursor over the right edge of the window until you see the column resizing icon. It has a vertical line in the middle and two arrows either side…\n\nYou need to approach the edge of the window from the left. If you approach from the right, you'll get the window resizing icon instead (two arrows with no dividing line).\n\n*Once you see the correct cursor, click and drag to the right to resize the preview column, thus enlarging the preview image.\n\n\nIt's not pretty but it works. (Hint: Use Quick Look instead!)\nOh and by the way, we'll be getting another option to preview files in macOS Mojave called Gallery View. It looks like it replaces Cover Flow. While it takes away the list of file names, it does add a metadata panel for the selected file which could be quite a useful little feature.\n", "Q: How to stop Google Photos from launching at system startup?

I'm looking for a method that will allow me to turn custom, nonstandard key combinations into a currently-unused intermediary key (like F16 or something). The intermediary key would then be able to be recognized in other applications (such as FastScripts), so that I can finally assign this intermediary keyboard shortcut to whatever action within that application that I desire.\nBy \"nonstandard key combinations,\" I mean combinations that do not incorporate any modifier key (that is, ⌘ command,  ⌥ option, ⌃ control, fn, or ⇧ shift).\nExamples of nonstandard key combinations, pressed simultaneously:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 + 0\n\n*A + D\n\n*space bar + V\n\n*W + 5\n\n*tab + Q\nI have installed Karabiner, but I don't see a way to accomplish this in Karabiner.\nAre there any programs that can do what I am looking for?\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\nA: This can be done in Karabiner, but is counter-intuitive and turns common keyboard usage upside down (check the first sentences of Monomeeth's answer).\nAn example for [M+N] to F13 is already provided in the presets of Karabiner:\n\nMapping 1+0 to F16 would require to add the following snippet to private.xml:\n<item>\n  <name>Simultaneous Key Presses [0+1] to F16</name>\n  <identifier>remap.simultaneouskeypresses_012f16</identifier>\n  <autogen>__SimultaneousKeyPresses__ KeyCode::KEY_0, KeyCode::KEY_1, KeyCode::F16</autogen>\n</item>\n\nBy defining an additional vk_lazy key (i.e. 0) it should also be possible to first press 0 and then 1 and depending on the first key up either send an F16 or write 01, which is a more comfortable behavior typing \"shortcuts\" on a keyboard.\n\nA: I don't believe what you want to do is going to be possible if Karabiner can't do it.\nThe reason we have modifier keys (i.e. control, option, shift, and command) is that they need to modify the standard alphanumeric keys so that they're being recognised as something else besides their alphanumeric value. Let me explain this further:\n\n\n*\n\n*When an alphanumeric key is pressed, its input is sent to the frontmost active application. So, if you have MS Word open and,  using your first example keyboard shortcut: 1+0, pressing these keys will be recognised by MS Word as a '1' and '0' respectively unless their value is modified (e.g. by a modifier key).\n\n*But, what you want to effectively do, using your first example keyboard shortcut: 1+0 again as the example, is use the 1 key as the modifier key and/or the fact that both the 1 and 0 keys, if pressed simultaneously, represent something different to a '1' and '0'.\n\n*Now you can see why this may cause problems: If the 1 key is acting as a modifier key, then how do you get the active app to recognise a '1' when you need it to? Or, if you're wanting this to work only when the 1+0 keys are pressed simultaneously, what happens if either key is pressed ever so slightly before the other key? That's not simultaneous and therefore your input will be screwed up (so to speak).\n\n*So, to get this to work Karabiner (or some other utility) is going to have to be smart enough to manage this conundrum. As Thomas Tempelmann mentions in their comment below, one way to do this would be to add a delay after key presses so that the frontmost app doesn't recognise the key yet. But of course, any such delay is going to have to be very short (trust me - even a split second delay in something can cause users to feel a system is not being responsive).\n\n\nYou may want to refer to the: macOS Human Interface Guidelines - Keyboard Shortcuts page for a better understanding of Apple's guidelines to developers on this.\nAs an aside, when developers create games and a key is used for a specific purpose (e.g. the Z key moves the character left) the game is still recognising the Z key as a 'Z' but has just been programmed to accept the 'Z' value as meaning the character moves left.\nAny software that appears to change the action of a key press (e.g. games that allow you to customise your controls, or utilities such as USB Overdrive, ControllerMate, etc) still accept the default key value rather than needing to modify them, and that's how they achieve their function. \nFor example, a user can use USB Overdrive to map a key (let's say the T key) to a particular function with or without the use of modifier keys, but when they're used without a modifier key they're still being recognised as having their original input. So I do not think they're going to be useful to you either, and of course, they're not designed to create keyboard shortcuts per se. However, you could check them out anyway (they're free to try) just in case you can trick either of them to do what you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB Overdrive\n\n*ControllerMate\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have used both USB Overdrive and ControllerMate, but do not have any association with them whatsoever.\n\n*For what it's worth, ControllerMate offers more advanced functionality (but it is more difficult to master).\n\n*You may want to contact Karabiner support or send the developer an email as I still think it's your best bet and may be able to do what you want.\n\n\nA: iKey should do what you want to do. \n", "Q: Remap CapsLock to Delete on Sierra Hi I've just got my MacBook Pro 2016 running 10.12.3 and I'm in a bit of a pickle...\nI can't seem to find a way to remap my CapsLock to Delete.\nI've tried using Seil, Ukelele and some other software, but non seem to do the job.

This is a somewhat common interface, and is generally used to move a user through a series of sequential operations. It can be found in Apple's Network Setup Assistant (System Preferences > Network > Assist Me > Assistance), in many third party .pkg installers, and in applications like VirtualBox. \nIt has a Low Opacity (light) image as a background, with a translucent Text Field on it, with a visually distinct bottom row with the next and previous buttons.\nHere is an example:\n\n\nA: These kind of windows are commonly called wizards, or specifically in the context of macOS, a term you already mentioned: setup assistants. That term actually describes the entire sequence, so you might want to call a single screen a wizard screen, wizard step or wizard dialog instead.\nThe transparent background image is something specific to macOS; most Windows installer screens show images as well but there, they're confined to either a column on the left or a row on top of the screen.\n", "Q: Are there any directories of the official icons used in macOS? Things like the share sheet, the forwards and backwards glyphs, the magnifying glass, etc. are standard across macOS.\nIs there any official repository of these glyphs?

What happened? I was using my macbook, which is running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (build 16B2555), normally until this airdrop notification appeared:\n\nOut of curiosity, I accepted the AirDrop and an archive started downloading.\n\nThe item finally downloaded, and I discovered it was an archive! To be exact, it was a .tar.gz file that I unzipped with archive-utility.\n\nThere are only 2 Apple TVs that could've sent me this file. Both are signed into the same iCloud account, but haven't been touched when the AirDrop request appeared. In fact, neither had been connected to the new Internet router we had installed earlier. I looked in the crash file and it mentioned TestFlight and other tvOS apps, meaning it's the 4th generation Apple TV.\nA few hours later, I continued working until I got the notification again.

Sometimes, when Time Machine starts a new backup, I see that it'll be several GB of data. I then wonder: What did I save that was so large? Is it perhaps backing up unnecessary data, that I should exclude in the future?\nAs a Mac developer, I understand that there must be some kind of database that Time Machine maintains in order to know what files need to be backed up. I like to have access to that so that I can stop a large backup process and then check the database for the pending files, and decide whether I want to take further actions.\nI am so far unable to find out where the information is stored.\nI checked the tmutil tool, but that doesn't seem to offer an option for listing the pending files, either.\nI understand that I can use tmutil compare after a backup to see what was backed up, but I like to instead see the pending files in the queue.\n\nA: The way the backup works is that it does a large base image of EVERYTHING and then each new backup just backs up changes. \nHowever - If you perform a touch command, or you move files or interact with them in anyway, this can cause it to flag as being a change, and it will back it up again. \n", "Q: Is Intel Iris 1536 MB ‘better’ than Intel HD Graphics 4000? I'm looking at a game which gives 'Intel HD Graphics 4000' as one of its requirements.

The HD 4000 is included in the Mid-2012 MacBook Pro so yours is newer than it, so definitely will work.\n\nA: Yeah, your GPU's light years ahead of the HD 4000.\n\nA: No, it won’t work. \nIris by itself gives only video memory of 128MB. \nIris is basically more for graphic not gaming. \nYou need iris and Nvidia video card together to get the best  performance. \n", "Q: Smart Mailbox filter \"Message is not in mailbox\" for iCloud mailboxes When I create or edit a Smart Mailbox and I want to add filter Message is not in mailbox it works fine for all my e-mail accounts except iCloud.\nSo, if I add such filter in some Smart Mailbox settings and would try to add some mailbox from my iCloud account, it will do that, but it will reset it after I press OK - when I open settings for this Smart Mailbox again, I see the following:\n\nAs you can see, instead of my chosen mailbox that I wanted to exclude there is No mailbox selected. And of course this filter doesn't work.\nBut again, if I add any mailbox from any other account beside iCloud to this filter, it works fine, so the issue is only with iCloud mailboxes.\nDo you know, why is that and how to fix this?\n\nA: I had the same problem and I found a solution here luckily after searching like crazy. The problem was, that I used my Gmail account as my Apple ID, so mail got confused. After I deactivated mail in my iCloud account settings, it was working fine. This is obviously only a solution if you don't use both accounts. Anyway, maybe it helps someone:\n\nAnd here's the solution, or rather the explanation for the problem: If\n  you're using your gmail Adress as your apple-id (and therefore as your\n  login credentials for your iCloud account) Apple Mail seems to get\n  confused. Simply change your iCloud Username to something else and\n  your good to go.\n\n\nA: I don't know how to fix it, but I have a workaround.  Create a smart mailbox (we'll call it Workaround), set it to \"message is in mailbox\" and then select the iCloud mailbox you want.  Then create a second smart mailbox and set it to \"message is not in mailbox\" - \"Workaround\".  This seems to work for me on High Sierra.  Now you have an extra smart mailbox, but it gets the job done.\n", "Q: How do I identify what PowerPC apps I use?

I'm trying to uninstall the Setapp. I was going to think about renewing my subscription later but it forced my hand because iStat constantly pops up a windows that says:\n\nYour Setapp subscription is no longer active, and iStat Menus Status cannot be opened.\n\nIf I cancel, quit, drag to the trash or kill iStat it always comes back. So now I'm trying to uninstall Setapp but I'm running into the same problem. The uninstall dialog wants me to quit iStat but no amount of hitting the 'Quit' button will make iStat go away and thus I can't uninstall Setapp.\n\nA: iStat Menus is a little different to other apps, in that it is intended to always be running and in your menubar. The main app is used to configure its settings. Throwing the main app in the trash won’t remove it from your system (we wish it could, but that’s not technically possible).\nThe normal way to uninstall iStat Menus is to choose iStat Menus → Uninstall from the menubar inside the iStat Menus app, then click Uninstall. \nWe have some additional help: Installing and uninstalling iStat Menus\nFor those using Setapp, here’s some specific instructions.\nUninstalling iStat Menus with an active Setapp account\nIf you have an active Setapp account, please choose iStat Menus → Uninstall from the menubar, then click Uninstall.\nUninstalling iStat Menus without an active Setapp account\nIf you don’t have an active Setapp account, please run /Library/Application Support/iStat Menus 5/iStat Menus Uninstaller.app\nYou can get to the uninstaller by choosing Go → Go to Folder while in the Finder, then pasting /Library/Application Support/iStat Menus 5/iStat Menus Uninstaller.app into the text field and clicking Go.\nIf you have any other questions about iStat Menus, or need more help with uninstalling, please don’t hesitate to get in touch via our website, via Twitter, or via any other means.\nClarification: I work on iStat Menus.

I say \"sort of\" because they can all start working perfectly again for an extended period of time and then suddenly for no reason they all stop working.  \nAnd then in gets weirder.  If the keys are all dead I can repeatably press just one of the keys and (after varying length of time) it comes good.  At which point the remaining bad keys also start working again.\nMy initial thought was that it is time to replace the keyboard, but the action of the keys all coming good at the same time confuses me.\nSo is there an explanation to what is going on?  Or is it time to replace the keyboard?\n\nA: Try removing the keys and cleaning under with cotton buds, there are some tutorials on how to do this safely - check your keyboard layout and settings in system preferences too.\n\nA: Your keyboard is failing.\nThe reason you are seeing keys in a row fail in that manner is because the keyboard circuit pattern is laid out in a grid. Below is a photo of an external keyboard trace (same concept in the Mac keyboards).  Somewhere along the middle trace, something is failing.\n\nhjkl are all on the same \"horizontal\" circuit trace, but different vertical ones.  Somewhere on this circuit, something has failed.  It could be an external contaminate or the contacts could just be worn (it is a mechanical device, after all).\nUpdate:  I wrote a canonical Q/A on this topic that shows much better breakdown of the keyboard assembly and goes in depth as to what the issues could be.\nThere are a couple of things you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attempt to clean out any contaminate with compressed air (lightly) or with 99% isopropyl alcohol (don't use the regular \"medicine cabinet\" rubbing alcohol as it contains additives). Use a small amount on the affected key, allow to sit, then follow up with compressed air to completely dry it out.\n\n*Replace the keyboard.  It's not an expensive part to replace, but it is time consuming.  I have used this exact replacement keyboard on several MacBook Pros with great success.  ifixit.com has a tutorial on how to do this\nMy preference is to replace the keyboard as problems of this nature seldom get better; they usually get worse.  Just a note of caution, the keyboard is part of the top case assembly which means to replace it, you will have to disassemble everything to get access to it.  If you are not comfortable doing this, have a professional tackle this job for.\n", "Q: Securely remove files from an NTFS drive? I have an external NTFS drive, and I want to securely remove some files from it. SRM is no longer available in Sierra. I tried to install SRM with Homebrew, and did install it successfully, but when I apply the command to an external drive I get an error: \"Segmentation fault: 11\" What can I do?\nI do not use software like Paragon NTFS to enable write on the drive.

Install homebrew if not installed from www.brew.sh. Then do \nbrew install coreutils\n\nto remove files, do\ngshred -u <file1> <file2>\n\n\nA: You can use rm with the -P option which will overwrite the file prior to deleting it.\nFrom the man page:\n\nOverwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are overwritten\n  three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then\n  0xff again, before they are deleted\n\nIt's not a DoD 7 pass wipe, but fairly secure nonetheless.  So, your command would be:\nrm -P /path/to/foo.bar\nAnd it will do a triple overwrite before removal.\n", "Q: How to download iTunes song (via iTunes Match) using AppleScript I'm trying to figure how to download the file for iTunes songs which are are not yet downloaded to my local machine (and reside in the iTunes Match Cloud) using AppleScript or any other library.\nMy goal is to have a script running locally on a cron that downloads any 5 star rated song.

I typically run four or five desktops in Mission Control (and have since Lion) to group tasks on their own screen space.  This is on a late 2012 mini, which I installed a pair of SSDs into and then did a network-install and then upgrade to Sierra before loading any apps.\nIf I have a window in focus and pull up Mission Control, and select Dashboard, it switches to the dashboard, but then almost instantly switches back to the active window I was just in.  I have to minimize the active window to get the switch to stick.  This is not limited to just trying to use Dashboard, which I admit I almost never do, usually I'm trying to switch to a different desktop space to go looking for a file in Finder for a reference.  This leads me to another annoyance that is related.\nPrior to Sierra, if I had minimized an application, and later used CMD-TAB to switch back to it, it would pull it back up to the desktop space it was minimized from, show the application and switch to it.  Now, it accepts the selection, but does not restore the window.  It does bring it up on the ribbon, but I usually end up going to the dock to restore the application to where I can see it.\nQuestion is this, where are the settings for these behaviors?  Hopefully its a trick setting somewhere I can toy with, but so far I've not found anything that seems to tame these issues.  I'm about ready to nuke the drive from orbit and roll back to El Cap or Yosemite, as these two issues are fouling up several years of work flow habits.\nI've seen several posts like this one on Finder loosing focus or this one about strange Mission Control behavior with the Dock that seem in the same neighborhood as my issues.  For that matter this one about auto-swoosh is close too.\nI've had my issue strike with Firefox, PHPStorm, Atom (GitHub's text editor) and the GitHub app too, TextWrangler, iTunes (12.5.5.5), Facetime, Messaging, and Launchpad.  I wonder if its not a fouled system hook for the little magic bar thingie on the new MacBookPro.\n\nA: This sounds like it is a MacOS issue. My 1st recommendation would normally be to update MacOS but I would recommend that you backup your Mac and then reinstall MacOS.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro RAM upgrade causes endless reboot I recently acquired a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2010) that has 4GB RAM (2x2GB) and according to Apple, the unit should be able to handle 8GB RAM. I bought 2 DDR3 PC3-8500 4GB from memorystock.com and when I installed the pair of them, the laptop would go into a continuous reboot cycle. I have checked the EFI and SMC. The EFI required an update, which I performed. The SMC is up to date.\nHere's the weird thing: I have gone through every permutation that includes both of the new RAM sticks in combination with one of the old 2 GB sticks. The system boots without a problem if it's only 6GB total. If I use both 4GB sticks, endless loop.\nI'm at a loss.\n\nA: Well, it turns out that after I RMA'd the RAM that I got from Memorystock.com, the replacement RAM works fine.\nProblem solved. I just thought that I'd pass that along...\n", "Q: Can I buy American AppleCare+ and use it in Europe? I recently bought an Apple Watch Series 2 in Germany. I now want to buy AppleCare+. When I go to this site and get to the \"Purchase\" page, United States is chosen by default and the price is $50. If I switch to Deutschland, the price becomes 65€, which is considerably more expensive for some reason.\nWill there be any issue if I go with the US AppleCare+?\n\nA: Where can I purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan?\n\nDepending on the Apple product, the AppleCare Protection Plan is available at the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and many Apple Authorized Resellers including many wireless service providers. Apple recommends that you purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan in your country of residence, because each AppleCare Protection Plan has terms and conditions specific to consumers in the country or region in which the plan is offered. Please see the AppleCare Protection Plan Terms and Conditions for complete details.\n\nsource: https://www.apple.com/asia/support/products/faqs.html\nSo Apple provides different protections based on your region of the world and the applicable ToS. \nI was asked to clarify\nApple's ToS for AppleCare is country-specific based upon where its purchased. So if you purchase a US plan, the language includes only language about certain laws in US states where they diverge from the general contract. Same goes for the EU - if you buy an EU plan certain countries have variations on the laws.\nThat said, from briefly perusing AppleCare ToS, all of them seem to offer the ability to take your device to \"an Apple Retail Store\" to have it repaired under warranty and no further qualification is given. If you've purchased a warranty outside of your own country I'd presume that that means you can get it repaired anywhere Apple has a store.\nI am not an Apple rep nor does this answer have any weight on what Apple actually might do. I'm guessing your intention with this question is to save a few bucks on your AppleCare. In that case, I'd ask if it's worth about the ~15 euros difference in price to protect what is likely a >1000 Euro device?\n", "Q: Plug two headphones on a MBP 2011 15\" Is there a way to use Mic/Line in as an output to plug a second set of earphones? \nI gave a shot with JackPilot which is not compatible with macOS 10.12.3.\n\nA: No, however you could purchase a USB device that gives you a headphone output and use Audio MIDI Setup in macOS to aggregate outputs so it would output on both. Steps for that are here:\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5933282/how-to-aggregate-and-use-multiple-audio-inputs-and-outputs-in-os-x\nAlternatively, just buy a headphone splitter to split your one 3.5 mm jack into two.

I've configured my touch bar to always show function keys in one program where I use those frequently (IntelliJ IDEA, code editor). Many hotkeys in IDEA are triggered using a function key together with shift, alt or control, e.g. for renaming a variable, I use Shift+F6.\nWith the emulated function keys, this does not work, the program acts as if I had just hit F6 without holding down the alt key.\nIt was no problem with the hardware function keys on my old MacBook.\nIs this a known bug, or a limitation one has to live with? Or is there some way to work around it? Perhaps I'm just to stupid and missing something obvious?\nThis is a major pain for me as a software developer…\n\nA: Ah, after some digging, I found out it's the fault of Karabiner Elements, a utility program I'm using to reassign some keys.\nhttps://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/435\n\nA: As @Patrick mentions in his answer, one cause of this problem is Karabiner-Elements not enabling the Touch Bar \"keyboard\" by default. The solution is to enable that keyboard in Karabiner-Elements Preferences (Vendor ID 1452, Product ID 34304) as shown in following screenshot:\n\nI filed Touch Bar keyboard should be enabled by default · Issue #1700 · tekezo/Karabiner-Elements to request it be enabled by default in Karabiner-Elements.\nMore information in the following comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/535#issuecomment-350522019\n\n*https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/535#issuecomment-350597725\n\nA: To make function keys work as normal i Android Studio - apart from enabling keyboard: \"No product name\"  I had to go into Preferences -> Function keys and DISABLE the option: \"Use all F1, F2.... as standard function keys\"....\n\n", "Q: Added SSD to mid 2011 27\" iMac. How do I keep user accounts on HDD and only use SSD for OS and Apps I've added a 240GB SSD to my mid 2011 27\" iMac. \nI installed macOS Sierra to SSD and then migrated apps and settings to SSD but left users data on HDD. \nAfter booting into the SSD, I opened:\nsystem prefs > user accounts > advanced options \nThen I pointed the SSD user account to my home directory on the HDD and restarted. \nNow when I log into my user account (SSD) none of my files or preferences are working or updating and I keep getting an error about keychain missing.\nDid I miss a crucial step? How do I fix this? \nBTW, I can't migrate my users over to the SSD as there isn't nearly enough space. \nAlso, I have been using iCloud drive for my documents and desktop in macOS sierra, perhaps that's part of the problem?\n\nA: Turns out it was just a permissions problem.

I want to disable further iCloud backups from one of my devices, but I don't want to delete the existing backup files already in iCloud. I couldn't find any way to archive iCloud backups the way you can do with iTunes backups, so the only way to prevent an existing backup from being deleted seems to be to not make a new one. \nSome context [Taken from comments]\nI recently updated to iOS 10, but don't much care for it. I do have a full iTunes backup of the device, but it's rather old. I also have an iCloud backup from immediately before the upgrade (I wasn't thinking straight). I plan to make an iOS 10 iTunes backup, then restore the iOS 9 iTunes backup, restore the iCloud backup to get my up-to-date data, then make a new iOS 9 backup. Then I'm in a better position to play around with iOS 10 if I decide to. I don't have time to do that right now, though, and I don't want my iOS 9 iCloud data to be overwritten in the meantime, since you can't restore iCloud backup data onto an older OS version.\nMy device is currently running iOS 10.2.1. Is what I want to do actually possible?\n\nA: If you turn off iCloud Backup on your iPhone, the iCloud Backup isn't deleted from your account immediately. \nThe Backup does get \"abandoned\" some time after it stops receiving updates, I think it's like 6 months... but you should call up a AppleCare rep to confirm what time frame it is, I never found out how long, just that it is months afterward the backups stop from that device\n\nA: Short answer\nSince you've clarified that what you're really trying to achieve is a downgrade from iOS 10 to iOS 9, I'm sorry to say there's no way to re-install iOS 9 on your device. Basically, when a user installs a different version of iOS on their device, the process involves Apple signing the installation. Unfortunately, Apple stopped signing iOS 9 installations in October 2016. \nFor more info see this answer.\nLong answer\nIf you do a full iTunes backup, it's not creating a disk image. Instead, it's a backup of your data, such as text messages/imessages, notes app data, map locations, call history, favourite contacts, various settings, third party app data, and so on. \nIf you've enabled the encrypt backup option in iTunes, then additional info can also be backed up (such as Wi-Fi settings, saved passwords, health data, etc). However, in no scenario is it backing up the OS itself. \nIf your backup was made while you had an earlier version of iOS installed, all your data can still be restored onto a device running a newer version of iOS, but the OS itself will not be downgraded to the version you were running when you made the backup. \n", "Q: Is there an easy way on a Mac to split an audio file at defined intervals? I have a 45 minute long audio (.m4a) file.\nI would like to split this audio file into a separate audio file every 2 minutes.\nSo, that:\n\nAudioFile1.m4a is created from [00:00] to [02:00] of\n  originalAudioFile.m4a.\nAudioFile2.m4a is created from [02:00] to [04:00] of\n  originalAudioFile.m4a.\nAudioFile3.m4a is created from [04:00] to [06:00] of\n  originalAudioFile.m4a.\n...\n\nand this is continued until \n\nAudioFile23.m4a is created from [44:00] to [45:00] of\n  originalAudioFile.m4a.\n\nHere are additional details:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am not particular about the filenames of the resulting files.\n\n*I am not particular about the file types of the resulting files (e.g., whether they become .mp3 files or stay .m4a files).\n\n*This is not a situation where the resulting audio files will be mastered to a CD or something. I'm just looking for a quick and handy way to split an audio file based on a specific interval. A minor loss in audio quality is not a big deal (but this would obviously not be preferred).\n\n*I do not want the originalAudioFile.m4a to be altered in the process.\nThe most important condition is that the method requires minimal time and effort from the user.\nThere are various methods to accomplish what I want in Microsoft Windows, but can this be done on a Mac?\n\nA: Use ffmpeg.  It's available via Homebrew and MacPorts, but I just prefer to use the prebuilt binaries\nJust off the top of my head, you could do something simple like:\n$ ffmpeg -i source_audio_file.mp3 -ss 0 -t 120 segment_1.mp3\n$ ffmpeg -i source_audio_file.mp3 -ss 120 -t 240 segment_2.mp3\n$ ffmpeg -i source_audio_file.mp3 -ss 240 -t 360 segment_3.mp3\n.\n.\n.\n\nTo put this into a script wouldn't be too hard\n\nA: I've written an AppleScript that will accomplish exactly what I described in my original post. It makes use of ffmpeg, as suggested in a previous answer by user Allan.\n\nNote: If you do not have ffmpeg currently installed on your computer, my script is worthless.\nI installed ffmpeg via Homebrew. Homebrew is very easy to install; directions can be found at the top of this page (the official Homebrew website).\nAfter installing Homebrew, run these lines individually in Terminal to install ffmpeg on your system:\nbrew install ffmpeg\nbrew link ffmpeg\n\nNow, you will be able to make use of my script.\n\nNotes about my code:\n\n*\n\n*Even though this was not totally necessary for my purposes, ffmpeg also provides the user with total control over filenames, file types, bit rate, the output directory, etc., which is gravy.\n\n\n*Certain aspects of my script are tailored to my personal preferences (e.g., including the current date in the name of the output directory), so obviously modify the code as you see fit.\n\n\n*I've done my best to include some error handling to catch certain potential errors, but this is obviously far from all-inclusive.\n\n\n*I don't envision myself needing to do this audio splitting task that often, so a simple .scpt file created in Script Editor is fine by me.\n\n*\n\n*If you prefer to convert this script to a launchable, standalone application, you can easily do so in Automator (by inserting a \"Run AppleScript\" action into your workflow and pasting the full code).\n\n*\n\n*In that case, you might want to adjust the app so that the user can simply drag the source audio file onto the app icon to initiate the app (instead of having to provide the file path of this file in a dialog).\n\n\n\n\n\n*It is entirely possible, if laborious, to program a VBR (variable bit rate) encoding option for the resulting files into the script. I chose not to do so because, for my purposes, this ability is not particularly needed. It would be somewhat complicated to write, since not all audio formats can be encoded in VBR (only Opus, Vorbis, MP3, WMA, and AAC audio files can).\n\n\n*Finally, I am 100% certain that the code contains at least some shortcomings, blind spots, and/or bugs, so I apologize in advance.\n\nI am not able to paste the entire script directly in this answer. The length of the code exceeds the maximum character limit for Stack Exchange answers.\nYou can view and download the full code on this Pastebin page.\nUsing the linked script, the user can intuitively split up any audio file into numerous files based on a defined interval, while requiring minimal time and effort from the user.\nNote that when the user does not choose the source bit rate as the bit rate for the resulting files, the script can take a while. This is because ffmpeg is slow at re-encoding. But, fortunately, the user can simply set it, and direct their attention to something else as it completes.\n\nNote that the format of two lines that Allan provided in their answer is incorrect.\nAfter several hours of troubleshooting my AppleScript file, I realized that my AppleScript file was not the issue.\n-t reflects the duration of the resulting audio file, not the ending time stamp.\nAllan's sample code should read:\n$ ffmpeg -i source_audio_file.mp3 -ss 0 -t 120 segment_1.mp3\n$ ffmpeg -i source_audio_file.mp3 -ss 120 -t 120 segment_2.mp3\n$ ffmpeg -i source_audio_file.mp3 -ss 240 -t 120 segment_3.mp3\n\nHere is the relevant passage from the ffmpeg documentation:\n\n-t duration (input/output)\nWhen used as an output option (before an output url), stop writing the output after its duration reaches duration.\n\n\nA: find ./ -type f -exec ffmpeg -i {} -f segment -segment_time 300 -c copy {}%03d.mp3 \\; -exec rm {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Debugging \"The Installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail.\"?

Like most people I take loads of pictures. Some I delete and some I put into albums for events, food pics, etc. Since you can put a picture into multiple albums I tend to use albums a bit like tags by having one picture in multiple relevant albums like a picture of me eating a huge cake in a \"food\" and a \"Me\" album which makes it quickly and easily to find a picture I am after by what I remember it had in it.\nI can’t usually do this as soon I take the pics, so I will only sort though my recent pictures when I have a minute. However it’s next to impossible to remember which ones have already been sorted and which ones haven't.\nIs it possible to create some kind of Smart Album or list showing all media that hasn’t been assigned to an album? I would prefer if it was on the iPhone directly, but something for the Mac or a web based solution would do as well.\n\nA: As of iOS 10.2.1, you can only do this in Photos for macOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open File → New Smart Album.\n\n*Name your Smart Album whatever you like, eg. Uncategorized.\n\n*Simply specify the condition: Album is not Any.\n\n\nStarting with Photos 2.0, Smart Albums do not refresh instantly with every change. This means that you can drag an uncategorized photo from the Smart Album into multiple folders.\n\nA: Not a quite solution but I done it by hiding photos in albums. If you hide photos in an album, they become non-visible in 'All photos' as well. Once hiding all photos in all albums, go to 'All Photos' and whether delete them or repeat same procedure by adding them to relevant album.\n", "Q: How to search file name that contains asterisk (*)?

Even so, my Photos app still displays my photos. \nWhat could be the reason for this?

I'm about to factory reset an iPad with a broken home button. I've been using AssistiveTouch in place of the button.  In iOS 10, unlocking requires the home button, so I have to use AssistiveTouch every time I turn the iPad on. My question is—if I factory reset it, is there a part of the iOS 10 setup screen that requires the home button to proceed? If I reset, AssistiveTouch will not be enabled and I won't be able to enable it until the iPad is finished being set up. This could make the device unusable.\n\nA: The first thing you have to do is unlock the device, which requires you to press the home button.\nA thread on Apple Support Communities has a possible workaround, but I can't verify it:\n\nOnce you download iOS10 and get to \"Hello\" screen, connect your iPhone to iTunes. Under iPhone>Summary page, there is an icon that says \"configure accesibility\".  Click on it and a window pops up, and enable \"Speak auto-text\" under \"seeing\" and \"mono-audit\" under hearing.  I THINK it should work with just choosing one or the other or any other options for those with seeing/hearing problems.

If I erase my iPhone, will my iCloud be erased too?\n\nA: No, factory resetting your iPhone will not alter your iCloud. Upon setting up your iPhone again you will be given the option to reconnect to your iCloud account if you desire. iCloud also stores iPhone backups that you can restore your phone from. Apple's apps are really good about storing items in iCloud, however many others are not. If you are worried about losing your content, be safe and make a local backup to a machine through iTunes, just to be safe. Alternatively, I believe you could schedule an appointment at the Genius Bar and have them reset your phone for you.\nEDIT: If you have \"Find My iPhone\" enabled, no one will be able to use that device without your iCloud login credentials.\n\nA: No, it won't. Erasing your iPhone has only effect on the device itself. It's even possible to erase your iPhone without an internet connection; how would iCloud then know to erase the data as well?\n\nA: When you do a restore, only the stuff on your device storage gets removed. As long as you have access to the iCloud account and the stuff you need is on it, it is ok to restore.\nBut it is still a good idea to do backups too! :)\n", "Q: How to merge pictures using adobe acrobat?

I want to create an AppleScript that opens five predefined folders in five different tabs in one new Finder window with predefined bounds and then shifts the active tab of this window to tab one. I would also like the full filenames (of the files in all five folders) to be displayed without any truncation. I exclusively use List View in Finder.\nCan this last condition be accomplished in AppleScript or automated in any way?\nThe default \"Name\" column width is too narrow; the full filenames of my files are always cut off. To fix this, every time that I open any folder, I have to either manually drag the \"Name\" separator dramatically to the right or double-click on the separator itself (which automatically adjusts the width to show the longest entry in full).\n\nMy understanding is that it is impossible to change the default width of the List View \"Name\" column on a Mac.

The answer to your question about using AppleScript to set the width of the name column to be big enough to display the names without truncating is also yes. I am not sure how to handle the tabs in the Finder window but it sounds as if you have a script that addresses the tabs already.\nOne big surprise (to me) was that I had to close and re-open the Finder window in order to see the change. \nHere is a script that operates on the frontmost Finder window. The width of the \"Name\" column is set to be 7.5 * (number of characters in the longest name in the window). It is not the perfect width but it works for me as long as I'm using 12-point text in the Finder. We are setting the width of the column to a certain number of pixels, and each character takes a different number of pixels since the Finder is not using a fixed-width font, so we can't be exactly right when setting the width. But 7.5 * the number of characters in the longest name seems to work pretty well.

(Note: when saving the file, if Excel has placed the .xltx extension at the end of the file name, then manually remove the .xltx extension before saving)\n\n*Quit Excel\n\n*Launch Excel\n\n\nYou should now find the default workbook has all the customisations you made at Steps 6 & 7.\n\nA: Excel 16.15 (Office 365), August 2018:\nCreate a new workbook with the desired properties, and save it as a template in the desired template directory, per instructions by @Monomeeth;\nbut the new workbook template must be named \"Book\", not \"Workbook\" (with default template extension, .xltx)\nThis is after \nhttps://support.office.com/en-us/article/customize-how-excel-starts-6509b9af-2cc8-4fb6-9ef5-cf5f1d292c19#bkmk_xlstart\nWay down at the bottom of the page:\nIn the File name box, do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*To create the default workbook template, type Book.    \n\n*To create the default worksheet template, type Sheet. \n\n*To create a custom workbook or worksheet template, type the name that you want to use.\n\n\nA: You can create a new template with your custom zoom level and then use this template when creating a new document.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new blank document.\n\n*Set the zoom to your desired level.\n\n*Choose File → Save as Template….\n\n*Enter a name for the template such as \"Blank\".\n\n*When creating a new document, choose your new template.\n\n\nA: I was struggling with this for Microsoft Excel for Mac (Office 365, Version 16.38, around May 2020).\nI finally found the solution in this support article from Microsoft under the \"Use a custom template for all new workbooks\" section: https://support.office.com/et-ee/article/exceli-rakenduse-excel-for-mac-k%C3%A4ivitamise-kohandamine-8f3c2396-3883-4e3e-a668-8254aeff6a0f\nI have abbreviated the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Excel document or existing template.\n\n*Make the adjustments you need to make to the template. In my case I simply changed the zoom to 150%.\n\n*Rename the default Sheet1 to Sheet. I'm not sure if this is necessary or not, but I did it based on some other documentation I found.\n\n*Click File > Save As. Navigate to your Excel startup directory. For me this was a Users > username > Library > Group Containers > UBF8T346G9.Office > User Content > Startup > Excel. If you have trouble finding this you can exit out of the Save As and go to File > Save as Template and it will navigate you to the correct Library area where you can then find the Startup > Excel folder. Note the path and go back to File > Save As.\n\n*Set the File Format field to Excel Macro-Enabled Template (.xltm). Set the Filename to Book.xltm. Save the template.\n\n*Close Excel and re-open it.\n", "Q: How to keep alarm silent during a phone call on my iPhone6?

I have to give a 5-minute Keynote presentation from my MacBook Pro in a few days, and while I'd love to not carry my phone around as a remote, I'm also not a fan of the idea of tapping my wrist every time I need to change slides. Is there a way to use my Apple Watch as an always-awake Keynote remote that I can hold in my hand rather than needing to keep on my wrist?\n\nA: You'll need to set up the iOS version of Keynote on your iPhone to be a remote control for Keynote on either another iOS device (such as your iPad) or your Mac. To do this, perform the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the device that you'll be using to present from, open the remote control configuration:\nOn iOS, this feature is located in Remote | Devices | Add a Device\nOn OS X, this feature is located in Keynote | Preferences | Remotes (Ensure that the Enable checkbox is checked)\n\n*On the iPhone paired with the Apple Watch, open Keynote and select Remote | Devices | Add a Device\n\n*On the Mac or iOS device you'll be presenting from, select the Link button beside the remote device that you wish to use to control presentations\n\n*Verify the code shown on the screen, then complete the setup\nOnce this initial setup has been completed, open the Keynote app on your presenting device and begin a presentation. \nOn the Apple Watch, launch the Keynote app. Once the app launches, it will search and connect to the paired Mac or iOS device used for presentations. You'll get a Ready message (Figure A) when you're ready to control a presentation. When you see this message, it means that you can open the presentation on your Mac or iOS device that you'll be presenting.\nhttp://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-how-to-use-the-apple-watch-to-control-keynote-presentations/\n", "Q: On lid open Macbook Pro 2016 boots automatically - after turning off I need to juggle 10 seconds with the touch id power button to boot I have the late 2015 (15 inch) MacBook Pro. By default it turns on when laptop lid is open. This is not good for me, sometimes I open the lid on weak battery to make sure it's not turned on, so I wanted to make sure it's off. And then it just wants to boot up, imagine. \n(Side note - I don't use sleep function, because it eats up an unoptimally lot of swap and compressed memory (which also cannot be changed since 10.9, see Can I turn off swap and/or memory compression on macOS 10.12, Sierra? ), I use nosleep extension to just lock the screen on lid close when on AC, or on battery for short)\nThankfully there is a leaked (not documented) bash command to change this in terminal:\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2017/01/19/disable-boot-on-open-lid-macbook-pro/\nsudo nvram AutoBoot=%00\n\nBut then if the machine is turned off, the power button behaves strangely:\n\n\n*\n\n*On first press (no matter long or short) the battery status will show with a percentage.\n\n*Until this screen and this mode goes off (few seconds), everything you do with the Touch ID power button is ignored.\n\n*Then you can press the Touch ID button long to power on, when you release it, Apple logo shows up so the system is booting finally.\n\n\nSo I'm happy the startup tune is off now, but instead you need to morse a startup tune through the power button to power on your MacBook Pro ;)\nIs there a tweak to make this work as expected for an old physical power button to turn on properly in the old easy way?\n\nA: This is a side-effect of the implementation. Setting the AutoBoot NVRAM variable doesn't actually prevent the machine from booting.\n\n\n*\n\n*The machine will still boot automatically when the lid is opened, or on the first power button press, but will only boot to a page with a battery icon.\n\n*Until the machine shuts down again (by itself after a little while, or by the power button again), the power button won't work to turn the machine on.\n\n*Once the machine is off, you can use the power button again, at which point the machine boots normally.\n\n\nA: Why not try:\nsudo nvram AutoBoot=0\n\n", "Q: What is the minimum \"delay\" in AppleScript? I ask this question because I've noticed that sometimes when I use delay with a sub-one figure, the delay never occurs. It is as if there was no delay line at all.\nI can't identify what causes the issue and I can't tell when it will occur. The issue may not even be based on the size of the delay amount. But, I have only ever noticed a nonfunctional delay when the delay value is small.\nIs there a minimum delay amount that one should not go below when writing AppleScript code? \nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\nA: In the AppleScript documentation for the delay command it says \"the number may be fractional, such as 0.5 to delay half a second\" yet doesn't specify a stated minimum time interval, however there is an interesting discussion statement at the end of the documentation for the delay command which accounts for the timing not being accurate.\nFrom the AppleScript documentation for the delay command:\n\ndelay does not make any guarantees about the actual length of the delay, and it cannot be more precise than 1/60th of a second. delay is not suitable for real-time tasks such as audio-video synchronization.\n\n", "Q: How do the cliclick and MouseTools command line tools differ? I would like to perform double-clicks via AppleScript.\nTwo tools that I understand are suitable for the job (since AppleScript contains no built-in mechanism to do this) are cliclick and MouseTools.\nThese two tools are very similar, sharing many features. Do they differ? Is one more reliable than the other?\n\nA: cliclicl is the easiest one to automate your work.\nHowever too simple.\nfor example, In your terminal cliclicl dc:. will do double click.\nI recommend using cliclicl If your purpose is just double click.\nMouse tools is relatively complex.\nTry cliclicl.\nIf you need more powerful tool for automate, then use Mousetools.\n", "Q: Can't open .html file with UTF-8 how could I change the file encoding using OS X?

I want to buy a MacBook Pro 2016, probably the 15\" model.\nSince I travel around on my bicycle a lot, I'd find it really nice if I could charge it with a solar panel.\nDoes anyone know how much Output a solar panel would have to have to power a MacBook Pro via USB?\n\nA: What I would recommend is going iPad Pro and keep a Mac mini somewhere else for things you simply cannot do locally. Since you are looking at the new models that accept USB C charging, you have lots more flexibility to use solar / iOS type chargers than before. The early 2017 lineup has 4W to 35W processors instead of the much higher wattage ones from 2016 and older. \nEven so, running LTE network and remote access to where you have AC power for your Mac keeps your bicycle build light and reduces your cost for solar 10x or more. \nI personally wouldn't bike with anything bigger than the MacBook with USB-C charging or iPad, but you could be thinking of a trailer where 35 pounds of gear and Arizona type sunlight would make a MacSafe MacBook possible. Also, the MacBook come with 29W, 61W, or 87W USB-C Power Adapters so you can pick a solar panel that would mimic those recharge rates. It's possible you could get away with a 29W charge on the biggest MacBook if you didn't run down the battery but 1/5 of the way each day and had good times to charge it (i.e. all day on the back of the bike in clear conditions).\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204360\nI have heard of people using the 13\" and 15\" MBP for light work and running all day on a 10W range iPad charger. They lost battery charge all day and watched CPU intensive tasks, but for email, light web, no video or no encoding work - they made it most of the day with less than 10% battery loss and regained 25% battery charge with the Mac sleeping all night on the iPad charger.

I've also done a good amount of bike commuting and have the dream of charging my laptop via solar. Currently I am using a 28w foldable solar panel with usb ports off of amazon. They discontinued it but it has a 15w usb c port that usually lets me get through a day's work with a mostly-empty battery at the end of the day. There are also plenty of usb-c power banks that charge at 30w-60w. I think 2 batteries like that soaking up 12w each and one of those 28w usb solar chargers would be enough to keep you going most days that there is sun. \n", "Q: How to pin output volume control to screen? I am looking for a program with a small window that allows me to adjust my computer's audio volume. I would like this window to be pinned over all applications/windows at all times. It would occupy a small area on the right side of my screen (for example).\nI understand that I can adjust the output volume with the speaker icon in the menu bar by click, click, drag. I would prefer to have the ability to change the volume on the fly, with simply one click.\nI understand that there is a dedicated volume decrease button and a dedicated volume increase button in the top row of keys on the keyboard. But using these buttons to set the desired volume actually takes me more time than setting the volume with the click, click adjustment via the menu bar speaker icon.\nIt may be that I'll need two separate applications to accomplish what I want: one application to adjust the volume, and another application to keep the window of the other application pinned on top of all other windows. The first application is what I need help finding.\nFor example, I tried an application called Volume Mixer. It offers a handy audio \"mixer\" that even allows you to simultaneously set and independently control differing volume values for different applications. But, it offers no method to keep the mixer dialog open; if you click outside of this dialog, the mixer dialog automatically minimizes back into the menu bar icon. And, because the dialog is not a true \"window,\" I can't use another application to pin the dialog on top of everything on screen. I don't know of a program that is able to keep a menu bar icon pressed permanently.\nThe easiest option would be to just use the Sound dialog in System Preferences.

Many after market MacBook batteries do usually offer a little more capacity in that regard.\nAs for the battery itself, I've never used that particular brand, so cannot vouch for its quality. However, since it seems to have a 5 star rating, it looks promising. As long as it offers a decent warranty (I can't read French, so can't tell), I'd buy it.\n", "Q: What is the difference between millions and billions in printer/scanner colour settings? \nThe \"Printers & Scanners\" Setting preference pane has two color options: \"millions\" or \"billions\" of colors. I can't tell the difference. Is there a reason to choose one over the other? Perhaps specific circumstances?\nI'm scanning old photos and determining the tradeoff for time/energy/file size. \"Billions\" appears to make photos three times the file size of \"millions\" and I can't discern whether there are archival benefits.\n\nA: This is color depth.\nThe Billions setting takes more disk space, so unless you need really high resolution of colors or see banding or just don't care about larger file size or slow scan times, choose Millions.\nYour reasoning is perfectly sound. Larger files for no discernible benefit - choose the lower fidelity.\n\nA: Old photos are unlikely to have colour depth in the millions nevertheless billions. In such a case, there is no point scanning images at anything higher than 24-bit. (See comments below.)\n\nIn a nutshell, in certain circumstances some users may opt for billions of colours if they're doing high end photography, graphic design, large format printing, etc and if their hardware supports it.\nSo, using scanners as an example, colour (or bit depth) is the amount of information a scanner gets from what you’re scanning. Basically, the higher the bit depth, the more colours that can be recognised and the higher your quality of scan will be.\nAt the risk of oversimplifying things, in summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Grayscale scans are 8-bit images recognising 256 levels of gray\n\n*a 16-bit colour scan can recognise up to 65,536 colours\n\n*a 24-bit colour scan can recognise up to 16,777,215 colours\n\n*a 32-bit colour scan can recognise up to 4,294,967,296 colours\n\n*and so on\n\n\nNote: The above is only a basic explanation and doesn't get into alpha channels etc.\nHardware support\nAs I mentioned above, opting for billions of colours will also depend on whether your hardware supports it. Obviously, displaying more colors requires more memory. Most computers today will have a GPU with enough memory to support 32-bit colour. Older computers, on the other hand, may only support up to 16-bit colour. Regardless of this, your display also needs to support this too.\nLikewise with scanners. Not all scanners can scan at the same bit depth. Using my summary above, a scanner only capable of 24 bit can recognise up to 16,777,215 colours, well short of the billions that some can scan.\nI can't tell the difference\nYou stated in your question, \"I can't tell the difference\". \nThis isn't surprising as I doubt many users could tell the difference between 16-bit and 32-bit colour scans, prints or displays. However, users with particular software capable of showing/differentiating between gradients, shadows, transparency, etc that require a wide range of colour combinations may notice a difference, and this is where it gets back to the specific circumstances you alluded to in your question. \n[EDIT]\nIconDaemon's comment prompted me to add an example of when a user may want to scan at a higher resolution and colour depth than what their own computer/display supports. \nLast December I had to produce some large-format posters for my sister-in-law and, to do this, I had to use her much older Mac to design it. While her older Mac wasn't capable of displaying billions of colours, her scanner was capable of doing up to 48-bit scans. So I scanned in the required images using 36-bit for colour depth and 600dpi for the resolution. \nThen, on her outdated Mac I used Photoshop CS5 to put it altogether and export the files as high-quality press-ready PDFs. These files were then taken to a service bureau which printed the large format posters. However, if the original images were not scanned at a high enough quality, then the large format prints would have been pixelated and the lack of colour information would have resulted in a print where some of the effects (e.g. transparency, etc) would not come across very well (if at all).\n\nA: Concerning a photograph with poor exposure and thus poor contrast — i.e. mostly almost white or mostly almost black…\nIf you have a quality scanner (i.e. from AUD300 or so), you can scan this photo in 30-bit colour (at a high resolution, of course), and then use software [which would have come with the expensive scanner] to expand the white-to-offWhite or black-to-offBlack range into white-to-black, and magically show detail that appeared to be just not there.  (I know, because I have done this.)  It is not actually magic, and will not recover the {blackened dark greys} or {whitened light greys}, but it can do enough to genuinely surprise you (provided, again, that the colour detail has not been entirely destroyed).  Note that, in this process of expanding a section of the colour range, the 30 bits of narrow-range detail become 24 bits of full-range detail.  (The technical term here is “gamma”.)\nFrom memory:  the human eye can differentiate 10 [or perhaps it is 4] million colours, under ideal conditions.  (Repeat:  ideal conditions; this includes using a large area of perfectly uniform colour.)  As noted, 24-bit is nearly 17 million.  Going from 16-bit colour (2/3 x 100,000) to 24-bit does make a difference.  Anything more is wasted — in the final output, that is.  (“Monomeeth” includes an example involving a large image printed professionally.  I would not entirely rule out… there being some conditions under which extra colour depth in the final print actually made some material difference\n— and indeed professionals can use (and then discard) extra colour information as I described above — but it sounds to me as though the issue in that example was the resolution — 600dpi before scaling — rather than the colour depth.)\nNote that the above means that a monitor that can display billions of colours (30-bit) is a complete waste (over 24-bit) — regardless of whether it is a cheap marketing ploy or a professional-quality unit (although conversely they seem to make them with either 6-bit colour or 10-bit).  Ditto for a printer.\nThe principle above (in which one saves an old photo believed lost) applies also to fixing things like colour bias or contrast loss in any photograph; if the final output is 24-bit, then an initial scan at 30 bits is (somewhat) worth doing.  In Apple's photo application, there is a magic-fix button, that does this well, automatically.\nIn summary:  it is worth scanning in 30-bit, for a perfect final output in 24-bit, but saving a 30-bit scan is just a waste.\n", "Q: Is there something in a Mac Pro that could make it sensitive and reboot when bumped? Bear with me here for a second...\nI have an early 2008 MacPro3,1 that has been my work horse for many years and for the last several years has been running continuously as the home server. I've noticed in the last week that if I bang the desk that it is on, the machine will cold reboot immediately. (how did I discover it? hitting a stapler for big stack of papers)\nMachine hasn't moved in quite some time and wasn't sensitive like this until perhaps the last week. Everything should be buttoned down well in the machine except perhaps the Bluetooth adapter on the internal mini PCI port, but the WiFi/Bluetooth is working just fine. Also, power cord is snug.\nSo I suppose the question is whether or not there is something in the PSU  that might be sensitive to movement or perhaps something else in the machine? Other than this, everything else seems fine with the machine.\nUPDATE 2017-03-14: One other thing to note is that when it reboots, I get the startup chime followed by ~10 seconds of no activity and then another startup chime and then it goes into the full boot routine. Almost feels like a CMOS reset or something like that, i.e. is there a reset button on the motherboard that perhaps is a bit twitchy? (no, I haven't re-seated things yet since I haven't had the time, but I did open the case to check that the two cards, the WiFi/BT module and memory risers are snug).\n\nA: This something is quite possibly a loose PCI card, maybe your video card, it can have some stress on it from the weight and pull of the VGA or DVI cable. Could be a usb daughter card as well. Unplug the machine from the power mains. Reseat the cards, blow the dust off them. Maybe it won't reboot on bump any more. \ntl;dr: A loose PCI card can cause a reboot, they aren't hot-swappable.\n\n\nA: Possibly faulty connectors in the back. Connected devices that are faulty come to mind too. I don’t want to say it’s the board, but in my experience, it could be if it’s nothing else.\n\nA: Greetings and thanks for this thread. Apologies for jumping in but I have also had this problem recently with my MP 3,1. Just small knocks on the desk cause a reboot after which it fails repeatedly to start and i have to force it off with the power button. Is there something loose inside? Power supply? I can't find out.\nProbably as a result of these episodes, I've lost all my RAM on one riser (but the other riser's RAM is left untouched). This has happened twice now and the first time it corrupted a HD as well. The second time (today) I left it for a few hours and managed to get it to start up ok, when I checked and found I'd lost 4x2GB of RAM. But I'm not so sure the problem is related to heat because it occurred this morning from a cold boot. \nNaturally I am worried to get replacements in case it happens again. It seems the reboots and the RAM failures are connected - but how?  \nI have explored for answers, including replacing the power supply unit and replacing the GPU (Stock ATI Radeon HD2600) and I've speeded up the fans. If anyone else could give a few pointers at least as to how to check things like the GPU, PSU, etc, and what might be causing the RAM to fail  -I'd be eternally grateful.\n", "Q: Is there a Mac FTP client that will open SSH at current location? I often find myself looking at files in an FTP client and I need to do something from the shell. My workflow is to open terminal/iTerm, SSH in to the same server, and navigate to where I need in the file system. \nOn windows using WinSCP there is a \"PuTTY at this location\" that I love. Anything similar on Mac? I see Forklift has a launch terminal button but it seems to only work for the local file system. \n\nA: Try Cyberduck, it should be good.\n", "Q: Touch Bar no longer working in Chrome Data\n\n\n*\n\n*Brand new Macbook Pro 13.3\" running macOS Sierra\n\n*New install of Chrome\n\n*No Touch Bar settings ever modified\n\n\nProblem\nInitially, Chrome would show custom touch bar icons. Like full-colour previews of each tab to switch between them. WhatsApp Web would have text auto prediction.\nSuddenly, this isn't showing at all. In fact, in Chrome, there are no icons in the Touch Bar whatsoever, just the Escape key.\nQuestion\nSince then, I've tried playing with the Touch Bar settings and reinstalling Chrome, but nothing's made a difference. Any ideas how to get it back again?\n\nA: The first things I would do are reset your NVRAM followed by resetting your SMC. See below for further info.\nResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). To reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote 1: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nNote 2: These steps will also work to reset the NVRAM (or PRAM) for all Macs. However, the late-2016 MBP models actually required the commandoptionpr keys to be held down for 20 seconds, while earlier Macs did not require this, but doing so does not cause any problems either.\nReset the SMC\nYour MacBook Pro has a system management controller that can easily be reset. To do this on your particular model, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nLet me know how you go after doing both resets.\n\nA: Answer: I'm an idiot\nReal answer: This was never a Chome feature, it's a Safari feature.\nI was simply confused as I had to use Safari when trying it out in the Apple Store. Obviously, native Apple apps have more Touch Bar integration but I'm still surprised there's nothing on Chrome and even Canary doesn't have much.\nI'm still seeing strange behaviour where in some folders in Finder the delete icon doesn't appear and in some it does, but this question was actually user error.\n", "Q: Wifi still going dead on upgrade from iOS 6? Having read about instances of wifi chips going dead on iOS upgrade, and knowing someone who had this happen 2-3 years ago, I have delayed upgrading the iOS on my iphone4.  I am at iOS 6.\nHas this problem been fixed or averted in iOS versions currently available?\n\ntl;dr: Could my Wifi chip go dead when I upgrade my iPhone 4 from iOS 6 to iOS 7?\n\nA: No-one here can give you a 100% definitive answer to a question starting with Could... (if you get what I mean).\nHowever, what I can tell you is that in most cases where an iPhone's Wi-Fi has seemingly stopped working after an iOS update/upgrade, they can be readily resolved by the user. In those rare cases where the issue has been hardware related, the iOS update/upgrade has only acted to aggravate a pre-existing problem.\nIf you have a compelling reason to upgrade your iPhone 4 to iOS 7, then do it. However, as always, be sure you do a full backup first. Also, in case you aren't already aware, the latest version of iOS officially supported on the iPhone 4 is iOS 7.1.2.\nFinally, if you do decide to upgrade and find you do have issues with your Wi-Fi, then feel free to post another question here for help.\n", "Q: What does mkdir -p do? specifically the \"-p\" part?

Can someone lend a hand?\nHere's my rough idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine how many parentheses are in the string.\n\n*Split the input string into segments. The number of segments is based on the total number of parentheses in the string, minus one. The number of segments should be an odd number.\n\n*Check to see if any of the segments contain embedded parentheses.\n\n*Repeat steps 1 through 4 until no parentheses exist in any segment.\n\n*Now that you have your segments, act as if each segment is its own string. That is, calculate the result of each segment independently, instead of simply using the previous number in the list to interact with the following number in the list.\n\n*Add all of the segment results together. \nI'm not sure if I have the right idea.\nI am aware that I have wholly ignored the concept of order of operations. I don't know how to implement this exactly, either. My defense is that this is basically a part of the parentheses code. E.g., 1+4*2 would first have to be converted to 1+(4*2) before the result could be calculated.\n\nNote:\nI stated that I want the input for the AppleScript to be the currently selected text. But, you will clearly see that I have not written the code in this way.\nFor the purposes of writing, debugging, and troubleshooting this script, I am ignoring that element of the script, because this is very easy part to write and makes testing the code more complicated.\nOnce the script has been perfected, I will simply set the Service to receive selected text in any application. For the output, I will tell the script to key code → and then paste the final result. \n\nBy the way, if these elaborate AppleScript questions are getting to be a bit overboard for Ask Different, then please let me know and I shall take them to a more AppleScript-centric site (e.g., MacScripter.net).

I left the sound notification and the banner enabled.\nYesterday, I saw someone else's iPhone: He still received notifications from Messages but the notification read: \"You have a new message!\"\nThat's perfect! I want that too. But no matter how much I searched, I didn't find any setting that enables me to do this. Web search was a complete waste of time.\nDoes anyone know how to conceive such a thing?\n\nA: There is a setting in Settings, Notifications, Messages at the very bottom: \"Show Previews\".\nToggling it would disable previews for Messages.

I am not sure what all hosts I have accumulated over time under my ~/.ssh/known_hosts file are.\nIs there any risks in keeping all hosts' addresses or doesn't it make any difference?\n\nA: \nIs there were any risks in keeping hosts addresses or if it doesn't make any difference?\n\nYes, it is. This file creates your database of trusted host keys. If you do not maintain it in any way, there might be a lot of them that are expired or possibly leaked from the original host. In that case, you are exposing yourself to MitM attack, where potential attacker can spoof your DNS, redirect your SSH connection to his server (presenting previously valid host keys) and ask you for your password.\nThis is a big disadvantage of not using any public key infrastructure (PKI) with central certificate authority, which would take care of the expired certificates by distributing certificate revocation lists (CRL) to all its users.\n", "Q: No Calendars Sync - iCloud or Google I have two Macs, and iPhone and iPad.

Its works everywhere, syncs and loads up great, except for 1 Mac.\nOne of them just won't sync any calendars, be it iCloud or Google. I enable the Google Account and then I just get no calendars download and appear.\nAny help much appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: On your Mac that isn't syncing, go to System Preferences > Internet Accounts. From the list of accounts in the left column of the screen, select the account that isn't syncing in. Make sure that \"Calendars\" is checked.\n\nNext, open your Calendars app. Click \"Calendar\" (next to the Apple icon in the menu bar) > Preferences (NOTE: Clicking \"Accounts\" instead of \"Preferences\" will just send you back to System Preferences > Internet Accounts). In the Preferences pane, click \"Accounts\". Select the account that wasn't syncing. Then make sure that \"Enable this account\" is checked.\n\nIf the calendar still isn't appearing, make sure that you're not hiding the calendar. There is a toggle button in the Calendar app that hides or shows the list of calendars available to display. If you cannot see a list of calendars on the left column of your Calendar app, then click the \"Calendars\" button in the top left corner of your Calendar app. This will display a list of calendars on the left side of the app. Make sure that your missing calendars are checked.

This will make macOS forget the network, after which you can attempt to connect again. macOS will build up the connection 'from scratch' and won't rely on any cached settings. I have to use the same trick once in a while for our corporate WiFi network.\n\nA: As a workaround you can set IP address manually\n\n\nA: If toggle Wi-Fi Power and removing preferred Network doesn't work then try \"Renew DHCP lease\".\nAfter the connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto System Preference -> Network -> Select Wi-Fi -> Advanced -> TCP/IP\n\n*Click on \"Renew DHCP lease\" and apply.\n\n\nIt works sometime. \nIf this also not works you can try with valid Static IP (add DNS also, manually)\n\nA: There are 4 main steps for WiFi to work and you’ve passed the first hurdle.\n\n\n*\n\n*The radios establish a two way link on the SSID - agreeing on channel, encryption, and what if any password your client needs to be let on.\n\n*The computer optionally asks for an address to be assigned (DHCP request) over the working radio connection.\n\n*The receiving access point will either answer that request or broadcast / assign it to another device to handle.\n\n*The response is delivered to your Mac which needs to configure itself for the DNS/DHCP address and subnet assigned.\n\n\nThe last three steps could be combined into one if you know all the settings and set up your network automatically. Since you have the message “does not have an address” one of the three things that happen externally has failed so you’ll need to manually configure the network settings or ask for help.\nSince the radio is up, you could run a packet capture tool like sudo tcpdump -i en0 with en0 possibly being another number on your system and look for those DHCP broadcast or ARP requests and figure out what network address might be available - but that borders on setting up the network so it’s really best to not potentially break the network for everyone if you assign yourself an address that was reserved or is in use already.\n", "Q: Is it possible to add a third app to split view? I want to open 3 apps in split view. Where one is on the left side while 2 are stacked over on the right side. Do I need another tool for it or can I do it in macOS itself?\n\nA: Magnet for macOS has builtin keyboard shortcuts for resizing a window to left third, centre, or right third of the screen, left and right halves, and any of the four quarters in the corners of the screen. Makes realigning windows pretty simple. Can of course use the second desktop functionality in macOS along with this too. BetterSnapTool is similar but I don't think it can do thirds.\n\nA: You can't do this with the full screen apps functionality. Full screen apps only supports a maximum of two windows.\nFor more than two apps/windows, you'll need to arrange the windows themselves as you desire. There are a number of apps that can help with this, as discussed at What Window Management Options exist for OS X?.\n", "Q: How do I sync contacts between 2 iCloud accounts? I need to sync my contact list with my husband's phone. We both have our own iCloud accounts.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this as a one time thing, is to open Contacts.app on a Mac that is set up on your iCloud account. Select all contacts and drag them to the desktop. That will export them all as a .vcard file.\nThen move the file to another account on a Mac set up with your husband's iCloud account. Open Contacts.app, and drag the .vcard file into the app.\nThat will get all of your contacts into his account. But this will be a one time thing, and you may get some duplicates. \n\nA: To my knowledge, iCloud will not do this between two separate iCloud accounts. You can pursue one of the following two options:\nOption 1\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an additional AppleID for contact/calendar sync only. Add\nthat account to your devices but don't sign in yet.\n\n*You will not be able to use your own AppleID and the additional\nAppleID you just created concurrently.\n\n*On each persons computer, drag your contacts to your desktop to\ncreate vcard files. Log out of the personal account.\n\n*Login to the 3rd AppleID (shared).\n\n*Drag the vcard files into the Contacts.app which will add them to\nthe app. Repeat this process on any additioanal computer that wants\nto share the list. This is the contact (and calendar) you will use\ngoing forward. You can still keep a private contact list under your\noriginal AppleID but you will need to logout and back into that ID\nwhen you want to access the private contacts.\n\n*Once you are done remove the duplicates or merge the contacts and\nany private contacts you don't want in the list. There are several\nadditional apps that will do this for you. Just do a search on the\ninternet for one that suits you.\n\n\nOption 2\nSetup a Google account that you both use for contacts and sync with that. This method is not optimal because in either scenario you will end up with all contacts included in the set and because there's always a chance that some future update to googles apps this method may cause problems in the future.\n\nA: A manual syncing procedure is described in the support forum:\n\nHowever, you can easily put existing Contacts on a new Apple ID. On an iOS device where you have the original Apple ID signed in, you can sign that ID out of iCloud. When it asks if you want to keep your Contacts on the device, say Yes. Then sign in the other Apple ID. When it asks if you want to merge the Contacts on the device to the iCloud account being signed in, say Merge.\n\nAnd once you've done this:\n\nGoing forward, it is quite simple to select new cards and email them to other Apple IDs. You would select the new Contact, click on the Share button, and email it to whomever you wish. When they receive it on an Apple device or computer, they can double-click the card, and it asks if they want to add it to their Contacts.\n\n", "Q: iOS MDM Monitoring Internet Search History My school have asked the students to bring their iPads and use them for school purposes.\nThe IT technicians have installed an MDM on our iPads and I receive this message...\n\n\nDoes this mean that the school can monitor my search history?\nWhat else does it monitor?\nAlso, I have included some screenshots of the profiles that are installed...\n\n\n\nA: Your school doesn't need MDM to log all your network activity. Nothing about iOS or macOS or any other OS can prevent them from logging:\n\n\n*\n\n*Every DNS lookup you make\n\n*Setting up a web proxy to save all the search terms\n\n*Inspecting the contents of packets to look at what sort of traffic you are generating.\n\n\nBeing able to control the configuration profiles means the IT can make it easier to push your device to a specific web proxy or ensure your network traffic goes to a different device than others, so it might make it a bit easier to manage traffic, but anyone that knows how to run the MDM will know how to do the above activities.\nThe one big dividing line is \"supervised\" - I would be sure you talk with your parents and school leadership to carry a supervised device with you. That's a GPS beacon that could report your location at any times you have a working network connection to the MDM. Hopefully there are strong protections on access to that information and some audibility to ensure it is only being used properly.\nWhen a device is not supervised, you can opt out of that management and remove the MDM but you will also have to face whatever sanctions or policies the organization has established for use of their network. When a device is not supervised, you may be able to opt out of network configurations that make it easy for the school to track things.\nWhen a device is supervised, you no longer have that control and can only choose to power on that device or power off that device.\n\nThe rest of the profiles are routine and don't change with supervision on/off status.\nThe MDM profiles are quite clear about what they allow and you can take each one pretty narrowly. As you can see Apple explicitly forces the MDM provider to tell you if it can \"list all profiles\" or has elevated \"add/remove profiles\" so there's not much nefarious snooping that can be done on the iOS side that you won't be able to inspect.\nI would sit with a teacher and ask them to walk through that part with you and discuss the social and privacy concerns. Being engaged is a good thing and you will probably need to look at each item and really think about the benefit and harm of going along with the setup and then make your choice what to do.\nGood luck and be glad you're on an OS that respects your right to know what's happening with control and your information.\n\nA: The manual enrolment payload does not by itself provide the ability to see network traffic on the device. However, that payload does provide the ability to \"add/remove configuration profiles\", which could add this ability. You would need to examine the contents of such profiles to find out exactly what can be viewed/controlled on the device.\n\nA: You said this was your private iPad? Then if you look at first screen shot and read: \"This iPad is supervised\", this means corporate/school owned device. My opinion is BYOD devices must not be supervised. Period.\nSupervision gives MDM admin great amount of control what they can do with your device. For example, if device is supervised, MDM admin can wipe everything, even your personal data, and this is not legal.\nNo one can monitor your browsing history using MDM. That's because all apps on iOS are sandboxed. Unless your device is jailbroken, there's no way to see that data. But use Safari, don't use any browsers they pushed, because, then they might be able to see.\n\nA: See https://www.apple.com/business/docs/resources/Managing_Devices_and_Corporate_Data_on_iOS.pdf:\nMDM cannot see personal data such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari browser history\n\n*Personal or work mail, calendars, contacts\n\n*SMS or iMessages\n\n*Device location\n...\n", "Q: Remote desktop into macOS from Windows I am doing some development on my MacBook and I would like to use my desktop to access it remotely as I have a dual monitor setup.

Is it possible to go back to the 'Slide to unlock'? I would also hate to put the Assistive Touch button on the screen.\n\nA: You can't use Slide to Unlock without jailbreaking.

I am curious to know if it's possible to use my MacBook Pro as virtual host to test application in different OS environments.

With the above driver installed, do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your MBP, go to Apple > System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select your user account in the left-hand pane\n\n*Ensure the padlock at bottom-left is not locked\n\n*Click on the Login Items tab on the right-hand side\n\n*Now go to System Preference > Hide Others\n\n*Now select the Finder from your Dock (usually left-most icon)\n\n*Press and hold down the option key\n\n*While keeping the option key down, click on the Go menu and select Library\n\n*This will open a new Finder window displaying the Library folder\n\n*Within this folder, find and open the Application Support folder\n\n*Now you will need to see if you can find the driver that you've previously installed. Look for a Tablet folder or Wacom folder and open that. If you see something like WacomTabletDriver, then drag it to the Login Items window you previously opened at Step 4\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n*Reboot your MBP to see if it now loads the driver\n\n\nNote: I have not used the above process for your particular tablet, but I have helped others with other Wacom tablets and this has worked in some cases. \n\nA: If you have a mac computer, you can try Connect my tablet from the App Store\nhttps://wptrnpt.co.uk/wp/connect-my-tablet/\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352696344\nThat worked for me\n", "Q: Create WPA2 Enterprise Wifi + Certificate Apple Device Configuration Profile Without a Mac? I am fully aware that in the recent times, Apple has moved from the IPhone Configuration Utility to the Apple Configurator that is available on Mac only.\nI, unfortunately, don't have a Mac, but I have a few WPA2-Enterprise networks that I need to create a configuration profile for.  I have Windows and Linux systems at my disposal, is there a way to create a configuration profile that works with recent iOS versions without the Apple Configurator, and if so, how would I go about doing that?\nNOTE: Any solution needs to support adding certificates and WPA2-Enterprise networks.  This is not available everywhere!\n\nA: Mobile Device Management.\nMobile device management allows you to remotely deploy profiles, and many let you create basic profiles in the web interface. You'll need to chat with several companies to find one that suits your needs. \nBasically, all you have to do is install a premade profile on all the devices you need, then you're free to create a profile online. \nThe only downside to this approach is that many of the better solutions require payment. I know SimpleMDM, Miradore, Jamf NOW and many others give free trials. \n\nA: Codeproof MDM supports WPA2-Enterprise WiFi configurations and they offer 14 days free trial of the software. \n\nA: Maybe not the answer everybody is looking for, but configuration profiles are basically just XML files. Therefore, they can be created and edited with a simple text editor. That's definitely not the most comfortable way to do it, but it still works if you are limited on tools.\nThere is an official documentation that contains all available settings. For WPA2-Enterprise, go to page 110 and look for the \"EAPClientConfiguration Dictionary\" section.\n\nA: You could also run a piece of software that allows you to emulate macOS. YouTube is full of tutorials on how to do this. This way you won't have to pay for some MDM software, or buy any new hardware. Hope this helps!\n\nA: I completely forgot about this post, oops.\nI took the plunge and followed this tutorial to run Mac OS X on a VMware VM.  From there, I was able to upgrade it to macOS, and now have access to the App Store for Mac.\nWhile this causes some headaches from a licensing perspective, I personally have now been able to use Apple Configurator via my Apple ID and that VM to create the configuration profile I was after.\n\nOther MDM solutions posed in the other answers do not work for me - I already have MDM installed and configured because of my workplace using Mobile Iron and BYOD; that results in me being unable to use most MDM SaaS solutions to set up my device settings.\n", "Q: How to prevent Script Editor from scrolling (and losing cursor location) on compile? I have some lengthy .scpt files. By \"lengthy,\" I'm talking character counts (excluding spaces) of 200,000.\nI use Script Editor.app to create and edit AppleScripts (simply because Script Editor was already installed). \nIf I save a long file in Script Editor (e.g., by pressing ⌘ command + S) the file will almost always scroll much further down in the file. The result is that I am far removed from the location in the script where I was just editing, and my text cursor is lost. If I type some text immediately after saving, the text is placed on the very last line of the document.\nSo, I have to spend a decent bit of time trying to find the line or area of code that I was just editing. I save often, so this time significantly adds up.\nTo make matters worse, after saving, the scrollbar in Script Editor is buggy and erratic for around 30 seconds. This makes scrolling manually largely counterproductive. Sometimes this erratic period is up to one minute.\nCombined, these two errors result in a frustrating and time-consuming saving experience.\nThe only scenario where I have seen these two issues completely disappear is when the script is short. As in, short enough to not possess a scroll bar whatsoever.\nI generally don't have many programs running on my computer when I am using Script Editor and they are never applications that are demanding. I usually have a couple Chrome windows, a couple TextEdit windows, one Script Editor window, and that's it. My machine is an Early 2013 Retina MacBook Pro with 16 GB of RAM.\nIs this Script Editor behavior normal? Is there anything that I can do to mitigate it?\n\nA: I just tried what you explained with script editor in Sierra and did not experience the same problem you are experiencing.  This may not be the best solution to your questions but it will definitely save you some time.  Why not just throw in a little comment at the place in the script where you want your cursor located after a file save.  Just adding something like --cursorand copy that commented --cursor to your clipboard then after you do ⌘ command + S , then go ahead and click ⌘ command + F (which will open the find field right there in your script editor window) then you could click ⌘ command + V (which would automatically paste that short commented line into the find field) this of course will highlight that text in your script and bring you right to its location.\n\nUPDATE - NEW DIFFERENT APPROACH\nJust add this handler to the bottom of any one of your script files.(I like to put my handlers at the bottom of the script to keep them from cluttering up the rest of the body of the script) \nCalling the handler at any point in your script will ultimately get the coordinates of your scrollbar, then it will automatically save the current script with the keycode command , then will return your scrollbar back to its original coordinates.  Just comment or un comment the calling of the handler depending on whether you want to save or not save your document.  Leaving the calling of the handler as un commented\n As I have it set now, Will automatically save your script every time you click the “RUN” button within script editor.\non setScrollPosition()\n    tell application (path to frontmost application as text) to (path to me as text)\n    set theFile to result\n    set theFile2 to alias theFile\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set theName to name of theFile2\n    end tell\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        get value of value indicator 1 of scroll bar 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 1 of splitter group 1 of window theName of application process \"Script Editor\"\n        set thePosition to the result\n        key code 1 using command down\n        delay 10\n        set value of value indicator 1 of scroll bar 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 1 of splitter group 1 of window theName of application process \"Script Editor\" to thePosition\n    end tell\nend setScrollPosition\n\nsetScrollPosition()\n\nSIDE NOTE:  I have the delay set 5  which gives me time to play around with the scroll position after clicking “Run”  to see if it actually works or not (which it does in the latest version of Sierra)  you can adjust the delay value or comment it out if you don't need it.\n", "Q: What would happen if I changed my startup disk to a flash drive, then tried to turn on the computer without said flash drive plugged in? I'm experimenting with live USBs, and I'm curious what would happen. I mean setting this through System Preferences, not the Boot Manager.\n\nA: The main reason for selecting a startup disk in System Preferences > Startup Disk is to let macOS know where it should boot from by default. This does not prevent macOS from booting off another drive in the event there is a problem with the default drive.\nSo, in the event that the default drive is not present or functioning correctly, and there is another bootable disk connected to the Mac (either internally or externally), it should eventually find it and boot off that. \nWhen I say eventually I don't mean hours, it's usually no more than a couple of minutes.\nIf there is no other bootable drive, your Mac will display an error, usually in the form of a folder image with a question mark on it.\nFirmware password\nNote, if you have set a firmware password on your Mac, the behaviour will be different to what I've described above.\nIf you have a firmware password enabled and you try to start up from another drive (incl. from Recovery), your Mac will pause the startup sequence and present the user with a password field instead. In this case, before the Mac boots up from the other bootable drive it has located, the user will need to enter the firmware password.\n", "Q: Deb packages on MacOS I've been trying to run steam, and more specifically Saints Row 3 on my MacBook air, to no avail. I was wondering if there was a way to install Deb packages on Mac so I could run a Linux version of steam?

Usually people who want to run Linux code\n\n\n*\n\n*set up a VM and install Linux within in. VirtualBox is a (good) cost-free solution here, there are also Parallels and VMware which offer more features but aren't free\n\n*install Linux in a second partition and dual-boot either Linux or macOS. Install instructions depend on Mac hardware, macOS version and Linux distribution. \n\n\nNeither way will compensate for underpowered hardware though (the graphics to run the game in your case). \n", "Q: How to choose printer from command line or from a Python application? I am currently developing an application in Python that will run on Macs and will need to print PDF files. In the past I have managed to send PDF files to printer automatically by using some commands in a Bash script.

Will it cause any possible issues? License issue?\n\nA: Yes, this can work but not exactly in the way you've planned. Let me explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, you can use TM to backup your computer, but you're not actually backing up a bootable copy of the OS.\n\n*Yes, you can update the OS on your internal drive to macOS Sierra.\n\n*Yes, you can restore the backup from TM to another external HD and use it as a second boot drive. But, before you can do this you will need to install El Capitan on that external hard drive and then boot your Mac from it and migrate your data etc from the TM backup to that drive.\n\n*No, there are no issues concerning software licenses in doing this.\n\n\nNow, whether this is the best way for you to go about things is up to you. Another option, if you're internal drive has the capacity, is to have two partitions and have El Capitan on one and Sierra on the other.\nYet another option is to use something such as Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper to make a bootable copy of your current system onto an external drive. Once you've tested it and are satisfied all is good, you can then upgrade the internal drive to macOS Sierra. This way you still get the two bootable drives.\nIf it was me I'd make sure I had a new external drive (in addition to the TM backup drive) and then install a fresh copy of El Capitan on that first. Once that's done, I'd boot up from that and migrate everything across from your TM backup. Then I'd do the upgrade to Sierra on your internal drive.\nOnce you've got everything working ok on both drives, you'll then want to think about how you manage some of your data. For example, you won't want to maintain two Photo Libraries, two iTunes libraries, etc. So you'll need to think about how you reorganise your files for use regardless of what system you've booted into, which ones will be duplicated or not, and also ensure you have a TM backup of all your data!\n", "Q: Get Keychain statistics Is it possible to get Apple Keychain statistics as they are there for Chrome's smart lock?\nI'm looking for something similar to what is available at this page (if you use Chrome): https://www.google.com/settings/chrome/sync\n\nA: In Keychain Access (available from /Applications/Utilities/), select a keychain, choose a category and observe the number of items shown in the status bar.\n                    \nYou can't obtain any statistics about your keychain on iOS.\n", "Q: How to enable VT-x for Docker on MacPro 2008 So I've read that it is possible to enable Virtualisation on MacPro 2008 however I do not find how.\nI know that I have VMX since the output of sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu.features is : \nmachdep.cpu.features: FPU VME DE PSE TSC MSR PAE MCE CX8 APIC SEP MTRR PGE MCA CMOV PAT PSE36 CLFSH DS ACPI MMX FXSR SSE SSE2 SS HTT TM PBE SSE3 DTES64 MON DSCPL VMX EST TM2 SSSE3 CX16 TPR PDCM SSE4.1\n\nBut I think what I need to enable is the virtualisaiton support which I can check with : sysctl kern.hv_support and output me \nkern.hv_support: 0\n\nSo how can I enable it ? I've tried to install the EFI update from this official link but it tell me than the update is \"not necessary\".\n\nA: The CPU in the Mac Pro 2008 does have VT-x support, so the CPU has the capability in itself.\nHowever, you need to update the EFI firmware to actually enable the support so it can be used from macOS / OS X. You'll need to update to version 1.3.\nYou can find the download link here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL95?locale=en_US\nYou can find the official explanation from Apple here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203296\nIf you already have the EFI update installed, then VT-x should be enabled by default.\nIf it still isn't you can find the source code for a program on the link below that will both tell you the current state (enabled/disabled) for each CPU-code, and then turn on VT-x.\nhttps://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Enable_VT-X_on_Mac_Pro_(Early_2008)\nThe program requires you to be running Linux on the Mac Pro. You could also run a virtual machine (although slowly without VT-x) in order to run the Linux program from there.\nThe last thing to try if you cannot get the official EFI updater to install the EFI update, is to flash the firmware manually by following the instructions on this link:\nhttps://pubmem.wordpress.com/2011/04/09/flash-efi-firmware-update-manually-on-a-macbook-51/\nHowever, this is very risky if you don't know what you're doing.

I have called Apple and an independent company and told there might be a tiny bit of hope in something on my phone called TRIM.  I am obviously not technical and have no idea what this is.  Any help is appreciated.  Is there any possibility in retrieving my pictures or not?\n\nA: Regrettably TRIM is unlikely to be relevant to recovering your lost photos.\n\nA trim command (known as TRIM in the ATA command set, and UNMAP in the SCSI command set) allows an operating system to inform a solid-state drive (SSD) which blocks of data are no longer considered in use and can be wiped internally.\n\nHowever, a data recovery organisation may still be able to extract photos from your iPhone's storage. Much depends on if the location on the storage has been erased or if the original files are encrypted.\nThe technical details of how your photos could be recovered is better left unknown; it is unlikely to directly help you.

I've noticed a sort-of lazy/post encryption strategy in MacOS/OS X with FileVault enabled and in encrypted Time Machine backups, and I'm curious when actual encryption happens. \n\n\n*\n\n*When I copy videos from unencrypted external USB 3 volumes to my FileVault encrypted volume, my write speeds are 100+MB/s. However, I don't think my macbook (Intel Core i7-4980) is capable of encrypting that fast on-the-fly. \n\n*When I complete a time machine backup, a lengthy \"encrypting...\" step happens, but continues seamlessly after un-mounting/re-mounting. This is more obvious when encryption is happening, but is the data exposed until encryption is complete?\n\n\nWhen does the actual encryption happen? Is there a period of time where my files are vulnerable unencrypted?\n\nA: When you encrypt or decrypt macOS will convert all data on the corestorage volume. As long as this process is not completed some of the data on the partition may still be unencrypted,\ni. e. unprotected. The process can be paused, e. g. when you shut down the system. It will automatically continue when you boot up. To check the current status of the encryption you can use: \ndiskutil cs list\n\nor\nfdesetup status\n\nData encryption on-the-fly is very well possible and normally you shouldn't notice a performance hit. \n\nA: Actually your mac is capable of encrypting that fast (perhaps you're confusing it with encryption+compression). \nYour processor has a special Intel AES-NI instruction set, specifically designed to optimize encryption speed. Looking at some performance benchmarks for that processor, the AES test performs at a whopping 8.87 GB/s multi-core and 2.94 GB/s single-core. No bottleneck there, but I can imagine some latency from processing thousands of small files instead of one big one like in the benchmark.\nTo address the confusion in your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*While logged in, encryption happens on-the-fly whenever you read/write from anywhere on a FileVault2 encrypted disk.\n\n*Time machine transfers data unencrypted to the external disk, then encrypts after. My guess is they designed it this way to be more fault-tolerant with slower finicky external media.\n\n", "Q: Unable to access iCloud IMAP I'm having no luck adding my icloud email account to either the Evolution, Geary or Thunderbird clients. They all seem to complain about \"IMAP username or password incorrect\", or similar, although I have confirmed I use the right password by logging into the web interface at icloud.com with my apple-id credentials.\nI'm following the directions in apple's support article, where they themselves sound unsure on what to do (!), e.g.:\n\nUsername: This is usually the name part of your iCloud email address (for example, emilyparker, not emilyparker@icloud.com).

I've done some research about this and it seems like this can't really be done even with Automator or Smart Folders, even though it seems pretty simple.\n\nA: Option 1: Using Hazel\nYou can auto-tag folders/files dropped into a folder using the commercial software Hazel, which according to its developer Noodlesoft, \"watches whatever folders you tell it to, automatically organizing your files according to the rules you create.\"\nOption 2: Using Folder Actions\nYou can auto-tag folders/files dropped into a folder using the Folder Actions feature of macOS. I wrote the following AppleScript based partly on one of Apple's default Folder Action Scripts and partly on a script provided in a discussion in the Apple Support Communities. I tested this script in Mac OS X 10.6.8, 10.9.5, and 10.11.6 and it worked in all three versions of macOS (but see the Important Caveat section below).\nproperty label_color : {none:0, orange:1, red:2, yellow:3, blue:4, purple:5, green:6, gray:7}\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        try\n            repeat with i from 1 to number of items in these_items\n                set this_item to item i of these_items\n                set label index of this_item to red of label_color\n            end repeat\n        end try\n    end tell\nend adding folder items to\n\nThe first line of the script, property label_color : {none:0, orange:1, red:2, yellow:3, blue:4, purple:5, green:6, gray:7}, is not really necessary; I just included it to show which label index number corresponds to each color. You could remove the first line and change red of label_color to 2 and the script would have the same effect.\nThere are a few ways to attach this AppleScript to a folder as a Folder Action Script. One way is to open Automator, create a new Folder Action, add a Run AppleScript action, and replace the content of the Run AppleScript action with this script—but this didn't work in my test. Another way, which worked in my test, is to save the script in either /Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/ (for use by any user) or in ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/ (for use by the current user only), and then do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, Control+click (or right click) on any folder to show the contextual menu. \n\n*From the contextual menu, choose Folder Actions Setup (or Services and then Folder Actions Setup).\n\n*From the prompt window, choose the name of the script that you just saved.\n\n*Check the Enable Folder Actions option in the upper-left side of the Folder Actions Setup window, if it is not already checked.\n\n\nImportant Caveat\nTechnically, the previous script only sets the file label, which is not exactly the same as a tag, as John Siracusa explained in his Ars Technica review of tags implementation in OS X 10.9; however, in Finder in OS X 10.9 and later, the result of the previous script will be indistinguishable from a tag. The previous script works in versions of Mac OS X 10.6 or later.\nA more robust Folder Action Script that sets a red tag and label instead of only a red label (although, as I said, the results are indistinguishable in the Finder) can be found in the AppleScript given below.\nThe script given below requires that you first install James Berry's tag tool (which requires OS X 10.9 or later). It can be installed easily with the package manager Homebrew (brew install tag) or MacPorts (sudo port install tag). If you install it with Homebrew, replace /opt/local/bin/tag (which is the MacPorts path) with /usr/local/bin/tag (which is the Homebrew path) in the script below.\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        try\n            repeat with i from 1 to number of items in these_items\n                set this_item to item i of these_items\n                do shell script \"/opt/local/bin/tag --add Red \" & quoted form of POSIX path of this_item\n            end repeat\n        end try\n    end tell\nend adding folder items to\n\nA third way to write the AppleScript (in OS X 10.9 and later) would be to install an AppleScript/Objective-C Library written by Shane Stanley called FileTagsLib and then replace the do shell script line in the script above with the appropriate command as described in the FileTagsLib documentation, but I have not tested this third option.\n", "Q: Potential virus as Excel macro, opened on iOS I have just received and email which contained an Excel file with a potential virus in form of macro. I opened the attachment on my iPhone (because it looked like an invoice I was actually expecting) but nothing happened and it looked empty. Then I downloaded it to my Mac and opened the file but I chose the options to run without macros enabled. The Excel was empty, so I closed it and deleted the file. then I was thinking that it was some kind of virus/malware.\nI guess with my Mac, I am safe with just opening with macros disabled but what about my iPhone? Do macros work on iPhone? Does this pose a risk?\n\nA: Macros do not run on iOS. iOS opens such files using Preview, which renders entirely differently to an actual copy of Excel. Furthermore, even if you open the file in the Excel app on iOS, macros are still unavailable.\n", "Q: Installing Elf on Mac through homebrew I am trying to compile an Android kernel on my Mac (El Capitan).

I have the following AppleScript code that opens a specific file in TextEdit in a window with predetermined bounds:\nset targetFilepath to \"/Users/Me/Desktop/My Fruit Log.txt\"\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    activate\n    open targetFilepath\n    set bounds of front window to {279, 111, 1180, 719}\nend tell\n\nThe problem with this code is that, if I have any other TextEdit files open, the code will also bring the other documents to the front as well. I would like, however, that only this one, specific text file is brought to the front.\nThe code will not bring a minimized TextEdit window to the front, but it will bring all hidden, non-minimized, TextEdit windows to the front.\nWhen I remove the activate line from the code:\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    open targetFilepath\n    set bounds of front window to {279, 111, 1180, 719}\nend tell\n\nthe file is opened, but its window is not brought to the foreground.\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\nHere is a visual representation of what I've described above. I had zero windows minimized on my computer when these screenshots were taken.\nThis is what my screen looks like before the AppleScript is triggered:\n\nThis is what I want my screen to look like after the AppleScript is triggered:\n\nThis is what my screen currently looks like after the AppleScript is triggered:\n\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, my code also moves the TextEdit cursor location after opening the file. I don't know that this would affect a potential solution, but here is the additional code that follows the above passage (x is an integer that is assigned beforehand):\ntell application \"TextEdit\" to activate\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"TextEdit\"\n        repeat x times\n            key code 125\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: I think the problem you're having is that you've misunderstood what is actually going on. Let me try to explain...\nThe first question to answer is why were the windows missing from your first screenshot not visible? Obviously, the My Fruit Log.txt file was not visible because it wasn't open yet (i.e. your script hadn't run yet). But what about the other windows? There's only three possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*TextEdit wasn't actually running (therefore no windows exist). This would be obvious - so no more discussion needed.\n\n*TextEdit was running, but it was hidden (therefore all windows are hidden). This just means you hid TextEdit from view. Running your script simply makes it visible again (along with all its windows except for any that may be minimised). \n\n*TextEdit was running but all windows were minimised. This just means TextEdit is running but no windows are visible because they've been miminimed. Running your script makes the app itself visible and in the foreground again, but all minimised windows remain minimised.\n\n\nIn your scenario, it's almost certain that Option 2 applies.  So, while it's not what you want to hear, your script is actually working the way it's supposed to in macOS. The only way I can think of at present to achieve what you want in a practical way is to ensure that your script minimises all other windows except for the one it's just opened. For example, you could achieve this with the following code:\nset targetFilepath to \"/Users/Me/Desktop/My Fruit Log.txt\"\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    activate\n    open targetFilepath\n    tell (windows whose id is not (get id of front window) and visible is true)\n        set miniaturized to true\n    end tell\n    set bounds of front window to {279, 111, 1180, 719}\nend tell\n\nAs you can see, I've just added two lines of code. I think they're fairly self-explanatory - They just tell TextEdit to minimise any window that meets these two conditions (1. it's not the front window and 2. it is visible).\nHopefully this works for you - but if not maybe someone else comes up with a better solution.\n\nA: How about this?\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n\n    set fWin to front window -- Since you're already using 'front window'\n    repeat with w in every window\n        set visible of w to false\n    end repeat\n\n    -- set visible of window id 189 to true (frontmost on my mac now)\n    set visible of fWin to true\n    activate\nend tell\n\nI'm sure that there are other methods to identify the windows. You could also do something like this… where a list of windows from the second to the last is used.\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    -- Assuming that front window should be visible…\n    set winList to (windows 2 thru -1)\n    repeat with w in winList\n        set visible of w to false\n    end repeat\n\n    activate\nend tell\n\nThe key term here is 'visible'.\n", "Q: Where is the postfix log on Sierra? I am running OS X 10.12.3. I do not have the OS X Server package installed, but I know postfix comes as part of the standard (non-server) installation.\nI have the occasional need to send emails from the command line and although I can send emails just fine using the 'mail' command, I cannot for the life of me find any kind of log that shows the progress and/or status of a sent mail item.\nDespite what this answer says (mail and mailx fail to send emails to gmail), /var/log/mail.log does not exist, at least not on Sierra. I have scoured the config files in /etc/postfix trying to find a reference to a log directory but didn't find one. I've even tried using the -mtime option of the find command to locate any changed files immediately after sending an email, but to no avail. All that comes up are the temporary storage locations within /var/spool/postfix, but none of those files are actually just a plain old log file.\nI read this post (Is there any documentation on the macOS Sierra new logging system?) about the new logging approach on Sierra, but it didn't solve my problem. I've checked system.log and although there are a few messages containing postfix, they are only about the service exiting, not about mail items being sent.\nDoes postfix even write a log entry on Sierra when you send an email?\nAny info on this topic would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This works for me:\nlog stream --predicate  '(process == \"smtpd\") || (process == \"smtp\")' --info\n\n\nExplanation:\n--predicate is used to filter the log. In this case it looks for the process \"smtpd\" or \"smtp\"\n--info shows all messages down to info level, which is good for most purposes.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to force xip files to use Archive Utility?

This will show a lock in your Menu Bar with an option Lock Screen\nAdd a custom shortcut to lock the screen\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n*In the App Shortcuts section, add a new item for All Applications with the Menu Title of Lock Screen and a Keyboard shortcut that you like.\n\n\n\nA: I use the keyboard shortcut Control Shift Eject.\nThis will immediately invoke the screensaver.  You will have to enable the Require Password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins in the System Preferences -> Security preferences.\n\nA: You can set up a hot corner for screen saver, and have the security settings to require your password immediately after the screen saver starts. This means when you go to leave the computer, you just move the mouse to a specified corner of the screen and BAM it's locked.\nFirst, you would open System Preferences, and then go to \"Desktop & Screen saver\". Then click the \"Screen saver\" tab in the top middle.\nClick on the \"Hot Corners\" button in the bottom right. Here, you can select a corner of the screen to attach an action to.\nI'd suggest one of the bottom corners for this. Since there are menu buttons in both top corners on a Mac, you don't want to accidentally trigger the screen saver every time you want to open the Apple menu or Notification Centre. I have the bottom left corner on my set to display sleep, but you can choose \"Start screen saver\" for a corner as well.\nSecond, you will need to go back to the main System Preferences page, and click \"Security & Privacy\". In the General Tab, you can tick the box for \"Require password X minutes after sleep or screen saver starts\"\nThe \"X minutes\" bit is a drop down box and you can choose from Immediately or 5 seconds, up to 8 hours.\nNow whenever you want to lock the screen, just move the mouse right into the corner you selected before leaving the computer and when someone else tries to use the computer, it will ask for your password.\nEdit Jan 5th:\nAs of High Sierra (10.13), there is an option in the Apple Menu to lock the screen, which does not cause the system to sleep. Works a charm. You can also press the Control, Command and Q keys as a shortcut\n\nA: Open terminal, type open -a ScreenSaverEngine\n\nA: What I ended up doing is to put a Screen Saver item to my TouchBar and configured the system in Security & Privacy to require a password after a short period of time.\n\n", "Q: Can two iOS developer accounts use the same paid bank account I have two questions regarding using multiple developer accounts. \nI have two iOS individual developer accounts.

And it was only 25 bucks. \nWill a 50w charger destroy my phone? \n\nA: As long as the charger is standards compliant, your phone will not be damaged because of the wattage. The phone and charger makes sure that the phone does not receive more power than it can handle.\nThe 50W charger you saw on Amazon is most probably misleading you. There's a bunch of these advertised as outputting \"up to 50W\". The reality is that the chargers have multiple outputs and each output only supports up to 2.4A per port - which at 5V is 12W.\n", "Q: AppleScript: How to double-click & right-click at cursor location? I want to be able to double-left-click, then immediately right-click using AppleScript. \nThe location of the click is wherever my cursor is located at the time that the AppleScript is triggered.\nThe AppleScript will be triggered by FastScripts via keyboard shortcut. I would like the script to work across all applications.\nI installed cliclick. When I type cliclick -h into Terminal, I see that it can double-click, but there is no mention of the right-click.\n\nA: Since you already know how to double-click with cliclick, my answer focuses on the right-click and traditionally on a Mac one used to preform a right-click via control-click, and as such you need to do the same thing when using cliclick.\nAs an example, using cliclick in Terminal, it will attempt to open the manual page for cliclick. I said attempt to open because cliclick doesn't have a manual page but will use the command line to preform some actions that will  control-click (right-click) to bring up the context menu, move the mouse to click Open man page as I've selected cliclick in the command line before pressing enter to execute the command line.\nThe image below shows the command line twice just so you can plainly see the full command line in the first line as part is obfuscated in the second line that's preforming the actual clicking on the Open man page from the context menu.\n\nThe image below is what appeared and was clicked when the cliclick command line was executed.\n\nThe image below is cropped but is presented to show it tried to open the manual page for cliclick.\n\nI do not use FastScripts, however the example command should help you to understand what to pass cliclick to do whatever it is you're trying to do.\nThe cliclick command line explained:\n\n\n*\n\n*cliclick kd:ctrl c:+0,+0 ku:ctrl m:+5,+5 c:+0,+0 - Full command line.\n\n*cliclick - The binary executable.\n\n*kd:ctrl - Press the control key down.\n\n*c:+0,+0 - Click relative to where the mouse is presently.\n\n*ku:ctrl - Let the control key up.\n\n*m:+5,+5 - Move the mouse five pixels on the x,y axis relative to where the mouse is presently.\n\n*c:+0,+0 - Click relative to where the mouse is presently.\n\n*Note: The full command line above can also be expressed as, cliclick kd:ctrl c:. ku:ctrl m:+5,+5 c:. since a . can be used in place of x,y axis coordinates e.g., +0,+0 for the relative position of the mouse. I personally prefer to use the former over the latter, however both forms work.\nAs you can see in the first image that cliclick was selected and the mouse, show as a text cursor, is right over the selection, then when the cliclick commands were executed, it opened the man page Terminal window for it, although these isn't one. However, it shows that a right-click was made and the mouse moved to the entry on the context-menu and clicked.\nIn AppleScript the above command line would be wrapped in a do shell script command as shown below:\ndo shell script \"/usr/local/bin/cliclick kd:ctrl c:+0,+0 ku:ctrl m:+5,+5 c:+0,+0\"\n\nNote: Use the fully qualified pathname to the cliclick binary executable if it's in a location that is not in the PATH passed to AppleScript.\n\nA: There's now a simple solution: an rclick command was added to cliclick in version 4.0, released on 2018-03-24. Details at cliclick version history.\n\nA: you can also just use like a click thing with control down, as that does right click\n", "Q: Slow Wi-Fi internet connection with Mac Mini We have two Apple computers next to each other on one desk: a Mac Mini and a 27” iMac (both late 2012) and both running macOS Sierra 10.12.3.\nWe have a Wi-Fi router in the next room (about 9 metres away from furthest machine). It's a Virgin Super Hub 2ac.\nThe iMac connects on 5G and works well – it rarely drops out and is quite fast (DL 49.37 Mb/S).\nThe Mac Mini connects on 2G (will not connect on 5G – it almost immediately defaults to 2G).  It is often (but not always) painfully slow in connecting to websites (particularly in the evening). It makes it almost impossible to use. DL speed this morning was 18.96Mb/s.\nThis is very frustrating. I have spoken several times to both Apple and Virgin. Both have seemed helpful at the time. Virgin have adjusted some settings remotely which seemed to work initially but problem returned. Virgin claims the Mac Mini is not able to pick up the 5g signal because of its specification.\nIs this true? Do we have to buy a new computer to replace the Mini?\n\nA: \nVirgin claim the Mini is not able to pick up 5g signal because of its specification. Is this true?\n\nNo, this is not true. Both the Late-2012 iMac and Late 2012 Mac Mini have the same specifications in terms of Wi-Fi.\n\nDo we have to buy a new computer to replace the Mini?\n\nNo. If it was me, I would share the internet connection from the iMac to the Mac Mini via an ethernet cable. This should be easy enough since they're on the same desk.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the iMac and Mac Mini via an ethernet cable\n\n*On the iMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences > Sharing\n\n*in the service pane on the left, highlight Internet Sharing\n\n*in the Share Your Connection From drop-down select Wi-Fi\n\n*in the To computers from list tick the Ethernet port\n\n*in the service pane on the left, tick the Internet Sharing checkbox\n\n\n*To ensure the Mac Mini is using this connection instead of the 2g one, you can either switch Wi-Fi off or choose to change the preference order of your connections in the Network preferences pane so that Ethernet is listed ahead of Wi-Fi.\nOnce you've set this up, you should have a fairly good connection on the Mac Mini. \nIn terms of why the iMac is getting the 5g signal and the Mac Mini isn't, it could be as simple as the iMac causing some sort of obstruction (especially if the iMac is the one closer to the Wi-Fi router). \nHowever, I have found more often than not many devices will connect to a 2g network in preference to a 5g network. While 5g provides a faster connection, it isn't as robust as a 2g connection. So, if distance is an issue (not likely in your case) or if there are physical obstructions impacting the signal, a 2g network is often better.\n\nA: If you still have doubt that Mac Mini supports 5 Ghz or not, you can check system configuration by yourself (It will help you to get back to Virgin with proof).\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Apple icon.\n\n\n*Select \"About this mac\"\n\n\n*Select \"System Report\"\n\n\n*Select \"Wi-Fi\" under \"Network\" field.\n\n\n*In the Wi-Fi, under Interface (en0) it will show you \"Supported PHY Modes\" ans \"Supported Channel\".

And if so, how do I know that the app is active in the background?\n\nA: There are some limits to what an app can do in the background, but once you give an app access to your photos, it has that access even while running in the background, and it could upload them to a server.\nTo kill an app running in the background, just use the normal procedure: double-tap the Home button and swipe the application window up.\n", "Q: How to turn on the hotspot remotely (e.g. bluetooth)?

Thanks.\n\nA: You can't just run an iOS app on macOS; they're different operating systems. You can use the iOS Simulator bundled with Xcode, but even then you can't use the same .app file, because the CPU architecture of the iPad and your Mac are different. If it's your own app, it's easiest just to build & run from Xcode; you can 'install' .app files from another source by copying them to the right folder in Finder.

You can do this by holding Command+R on startup, clicking on \"Reinstall macOS\" or \"Reinstall OS X\", and following the prompts.\nNote that this will not destroy any of your files or programs. It simply reinstalls the system applications, but any settings, files, or applications that you have on your computer should not be changed.\n(You may consider making a backup first.)\n\nA: If someone will looking for the resources that I looked for, so there is a link to youtube channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdOYqsUTqTRetMWwuUBxxg\n", "Q: Distribute iOS app to customers without enterprise account At our company we are developing apps (Android and iOS) for use by other companies. The app (or the right to use the app) is sold together with the server solution (app works with a custom server at that companies' headquarters, that would only work on their network - or VPN) and also a desktop solution that uses the same server. Basically a complete software and hardware solution for use by that company. Payment is made for the whole package, together with maintenance, so selling the app in the store is not a solution.\nIs there any way to distribute the app to the customer without them having an enterprise account? (we think it would be difficult to convince clients to pay 300$/year extra just for an app). The simplest solution would be to publish the app on the App Store for free, as it would be useless without the custom server and credentials, could it pass the approval process? Or is there any other solution?\n\nA: This would definitely work as a (free or paid) app on the App Store. Just make sure you have a demo account which Apple can use during the review process (there's a section in iTunes Connect where you can specify credentials for them). You might let the app connect to a different (test) server if somebody logs in with username info@apple.com.\n", "Q: (SOLVED) - Error: \"The device does not have the necessary services\" when using bluetooth to browse files on Galaxy S7 Edge How do I get the \"necessary services\" on my Galaxy S7 Edge phone using Android Marshmallow so I can use bluetooth to browse and transfer files between my Macbook Pro and my phone?\nThe error message \"The device does not have the necessary services\" shows up after I click the \"Browse\" button on the \"Browse Device\" window after selecting my phone as the Bluetooth device.\n\nA: Even if it should be part of the Android OS, looks like the OBEX FTP service is not included.\nI searched the Play Store and there is at least one program that allows for browsing from a paired device (in this case my Mac) and it's: Bluetooth File Transfer (that also works as a client).\nRemember to go into the app settings to select which folder will be used as a root for the server, otherwise it's set to /store/emulated/0\n\nA: I found a way to do this on rawinfopages.com.\nThank you guys!\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Sharing\n\n*Select Bluetooth Sharing to see the settings\n\n*You can do what you want here.

My original OS is 10.10.5. I had trouble with really bad beach balling. I ran an Malware bytes scan, everything is good. I ran disk permissions in Disk Utility with a total of two repairs and verified after each repair. Verified a total of three times. Prior to verifiying it a third time I received a cksum error on both repairs. I erased the hard drive anyways because it was still beach balling and it went from 10.10.5 to 10.8. I ran an upgrade that took at least 12 hours to complete. It rebooted and it stilled continued to beach ball after the upgrade install. SMART status is verified so I'm assuming the hard drive is good.\n\nA: Sounds like you have the 13\" MacBook Pro 2012, Disk Utility is not indicating a failing hard drive via its SMART status, and that the OS and/or any software you are running is not the cause there is one other thing I've not seen you mention you need to check into.\nThis model MBP13 2012 can develop an issue with the flex cable that connects the hard drive to the rest of the computer if the unit is getting carried around in a back pack or heavy book bag. The cable can be damaged by compression of the bottom case in the area where the cable runs from the hard drive to the logic board causing errors in the integrity of the data flowing to and from the hard drive.\nCheck out Apple's website but for this model they may still be offering to replace that cable at no cost for the 2012 only. If you've never had the hard drive flex cable replaced then all things being equal that may actually be the cause. Failure of this cable/bracket assembly starts as a general slowdown of even the simplest things on the computer like just opening a folder full of files. Best of luck with it.\n", "Q: Flickering/Blinking MacBook Pro 2015 (While Static) Got this problem, can someone help? If external display plugged in - all ok, no blinking.

In other words, it is impossible to run this code more than once on the same variable.\nFor example, the following code:\nset varText to \"\nThis is sentence 1.\nThis is sentence 2.\nThis is sentence 3.\nThis is sentence 4.\"\nset varText to do shell script \"sed -e '1d;3d' <<< \" & quoted form of varText\n-- Employing the same method on the same variable:\nset varText to do shell script \"sed -e '1d;3d' <<< \" & quoted form of varText\nreturn varText\n\nreturns\n\"\"\nSince this method only works correctly if the lines of the text variable are the product of a linefeed (as it should), the problem is not that this method fails to perceive a return as a new line (as I had originally claimed in this question).

Even the compiled do shell script \"sed ...\" command in Script Editor still has \\n (x0A) not \\r (x0D) however why it's being returned with \\r (x0D) intend of the expected \\n (x0A) is a mystery to me at the moment and I'm going to consider this an AppleScript bug since it not mirroring the expected behavior of the same when run in Terminal.\nSo, to account for the bug in the results of the do shell script \"sed ...\" command, this is how I'd handle it. After the do shell script \"sed ...\" command use the following lines of code:\nset newLine to \"\\n\"\nset varText to paragraphs of varText\nset oldTID to AppleScript's text item delimiters\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to newLine\nset varText to varText as string\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldTID\n\nNow what's returned contains new line (x0A) characters as it should have to begin with if there wasn't this bug, not carriage return (x0D) characters.\n\nNote: When compiled, the set newLine to \"\\n\" line of code will show as below:\nset newLine to \"\n\"\n\n\nA: Okay, I've deleted the original and first edit because you've edited your originally question to the point it's easier to write a new answer altogether.\nSince your originally question showed the following line of code, as an example of how the variable may be set, I'm going to include it to say the following.\nWhether the varText has been set by e.g.:\nset varText to (return & \"This is sentence 1.\" & return & \"This is sentence 2.\" & return & \"This is sentence 3.\" & return & \"This is sentence 4.\")\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In which return is x0D vs. the more proper use of linefeed (x0A) instead, in a case where the variable is data and not a disposable message.\n\n\nOr: \nset varText to \"\nThis is sentence 1.\nThis is sentence 2.\nThis is sentence 3.\nThis is sentence 4.\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In which each of these lines actually end with a linefeed (x0A) as it should be on a Mac.\n\n\nThe do shell script command has a bug as it converts x0A to x0D after what's returned from the command line having the expected x0A endings passed back. I confirmed this because if I use the following:\nset varText to \"\nThis is sentence 1.\nThis is sentence 2.\nThis is sentence 3.\nThis is sentence 4.\"\n\nset varText to do shell script \"sed  -e '1d;3d' <<< \" & quoted form of varText & \" | tee $HOME/Desktop/outfile\"\n\nThen outfile contains linefeed (x0A) endings so the same is returned to do shell script but it then erroneously converts the x0A line endings to x0D endings which can then handled by the following:\nSo, to accommodate the bug, always insure the content of the variable passed and returned contains x0A line endings by using the following handler and example code.\nThe following assumes that varText has already been set by either of the methods described above.\non ensureLinesEndWith0A(varText)\n    set varText to paragraphs of varText\n    set oldTID to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to linefeed\n    set varText to varText as string\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldTID\n    return varText\nend ensureLinesEndWith0A\n\nset varText to ensureLinesEndWith0A(varText)\nset varText to do shell script \"sed  -e '1d;3d' <<< \" & quoted form of varText\nset varText to ensureLinesEndWith0A(varText)\n\nYou could then use the following again to delete more lines from varText:\nset varText to ensureLinesEndWith0A(varText)\nset varText to do shell script \"sed  -e '1d;3d' <<< \" & quoted form of varText\nset varText to ensureLinesEndWith0A(varText)\n\nThe image below shows and example of calling the do shell script \" sed ...\" command twice. \n\n\nA: Let's break down this script into smaller pieces and then put it all together in one AppleScript.\nThis approach is written entirely in AppleScript and requires no external tools. Using external tools, like perl or sed, will likely result in much shorter solutions but you have mentioned in other questions wanting to learn AppleScript.\n1. Split with Delimiters\nYou can use AppleScript's delimiters behaviour to split a string. You can change the delimiter as desired to return, linefeed, or even characters like = :\n -- http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=24473\n to split(someText, delimiter)\n     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to delimiter\n     set someText to someText's text items\n     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"\"} --> restore delimiters to default value\n     return someText\n end split\n\n set myText to (return & \"This is sentence 1.\" & return & \"This is sentence 2.\" & return & \"This is sentence 3.\" & return & \"This is sentence 4.\")\n set myLines to split(myText, return)\n\n2. Filter List\nWith the returned list, you can filter out the undesirable items using a loop:\n -- http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=24525\n set indexesToDelete to {1, 4}\n set cleanList to {}\n\n repeat with i from 1 to count myLines\n     if i is not in indexesToDelete then set cleanList's end to myLines's item i\n end repeat\n\n3. Combine the Items\nThe filtered list of sentences can be re-combined using another loop:\n-- Combine the filtered list into a string\nset myResult to \"\"\nrepeat with i from 1 to count cleanList\n    if myResult is \"\" then\n        set myResult to cleanList's item i\n    else\n        set myResult to myResult & return & cleanList's item i\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nEntirely AppleScript\nCombining these snippets results in the following code:\n-- Get the text to work with\nset myText to (return & \"This is sentence 1.\" & return & \"This is sentence 2.\" & return & \"This is sentence 3.\" & return & \"This is sentence 4.\")\n\n-- Split the text into lines based on 'return' delimiter\nset myLines to split(myText, return)\n\n-- Filter out indexes 1 and 4 using a loop\nset indexesToDelete to {1, 4}\nset cleanList to {}\nrepeat with i from 1 to count myLines\n    if i is not in indexesToDelete then set cleanList's end to myLines's item i\nend repeat\n\n-- Combine the filtered list into a string\nset myResult to \"\"\nrepeat with i from 1 to count cleanList\n    if myResult is \"\" then\n        set myResult to cleanList's item i\n    else\n        set myResult to myResult & return & cleanList's item i\n    end if\nend repeat\n\n-- Final string\nmyResult\n\nto split(someText, delimiter)\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to delimiter\n    set someText to someText's text items\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"\"} --> restore delimiters to default value\n    return someText\nend split\n\nThe script above could be reduced by combining the filter and re-combination loops. I have left these as separate tasks to better demonstrate their roles.\n", "Q: Why is my MacBook Air is making ticking sounds? Recently, my MacBook Air began making ticking sounds at regular intervals once powered on, akin to the sound of a woodpecker. The sounds occur at regular intervals, beginning every 5.2(ish) seconds and lasting about .8 seconds. I cannot identify where the sound is coming from. What could this be caused by? Is it something to take to my local genius bar urgently or is it simply an annoyance?\n\nA: You don't specify the exact model of MacBook Air, but if it's one of the first models, or one of the Late 2008 or mid 2009 models, then it's possible you have a HDD for storage instead of a SSD. \nA hard drive starting to have problems could certainly explain the ticking sound (although you seem to provide very precise and regular intervals). Otherwise it could be a fan.\nRegardless, I would strongly recommend you testing your hardware. How you do this will depend on your model, so choose the appropriate option below.\nRun Apple Hardware Test for all MacBook Airs up to and including the Mid-2012 models\nYour model uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\nRun Apple Diagnostics for all MacBook Airs from Mid-2013 onwards\nYour model uses Apple Diagnostics. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n\nA: I had the exact same symptom just now on booting an MacBook Air (2014 I think). Regular 5 rapid ticks repeating every ~3 seconds were there. It seemed to be coming from the MagSafe port.\nAfter reading on this thread that it could be a fan issue, I gave the machine a couple of firm taps underneath the port. The fan immediately spooled up to full speed for ~1 second, then turned off. The clicks were  gone. Appears to be an issue with the fan failing to spool - hopefully just dust or debris that's now cleared.\n\nA: It's indeed difficult to know, but if you don't have the 1st gen. with a spinning hard drive, I had a similar ticking on my 2011 MacBook Air 13\". Very regular with approx. the interval you indicate. I have heard of one other instance with the same too, which indicates there are probably many of them.\nMine started after a fall, which didn't leave any visible marks. Could have been incidental. \nI identified the source as close to the MagSafe connector. My hypothesis was and continues to be that it was power related, i.e. 'sparks' or electricity jumps somewhere on the MagSafe board, probably capacitor related. It never bothered me enough to truly investigate, and it came and went, sometimes gone for weeks before it would start again.\nIf you want to test, I would get a new MagSafe board off eBay, stick it in and see if the sound disappear. Then report back.\n", "Q: iTunes University: Items Not Available from U.C. Berkeley I have been listening to Professor John R. Searle's course lectures from U.C. Berkeley through iTunes University.

Turns out this is neither an issue on my end nor on Apple's.\nI will post the pertinents, even if they are off-topic, because it is pretty \"WTaF?\"\nFrom: http://www.weeklystandard.com/berkeley-goes-offline/article/2007201\n\nA few years ago, an adjunct professor and disability-rights activist named Stacy Nowak went to take a look at a college course offered online by the University of California, Berkeley. ...\nSince 2012, UC Berkeley (among many other schools) has offered video and audio recordings of many of its courses to the general public, via YouTube and iTunes U. The Seussian acronym is MOOCs, for massive open online courses. Over the years Berkeley's catalogue of MOOCs has grown to more than 40,000 hours of high-end pedagogy. There are introductory courses in economics, European history, statistics, physics, geography, and pretty much everything else. More advanced courses range from \"Scientific Approaches to Consciousness\" and \"Game Theory\" to \"The Planets\" and \"Philosophy of Language,\" this last taught by John Searle, the country's, and maybe the world's, greatest living philosopher. ...\nAfter Nowak notified the National Association of the Deaf of her frustration with Berkeley's MOOCs, NAD went straight to the white-hot center of the American grievance industry, the federal government's Department of Justice. The organization filed a complaint with DoJ on behalf of Nowak and a Gallaudet colleague as \"aggrieved individuals.\" The government lawyers got to work. ...\nThe easiest course, administrators concluded, was simply to pull all the MOOCs from the Internet, so that disabled members of the general public will no longer have to be subjected to such discriminatory offenses—and, also, so that the federal government won't sue UC Berkeley. ...\n\nFortunately per: https://lbry.io/news/20000-illegal-college-lectures-rescued\n\nToday, the University of California at Berkeley has deleted 20,000 college lectures from its YouTube channel. Berkeley removed the videos because of a lawsuit brought by two students from another university under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nWe copied all 20,000 and are making them permanently available for free via LBRY.\n\nMaybe iTunes U will pick them up, but I doubt it.\n", "Q: iphone linked to an appleID I purchased an iPhone 6s second hand and the person whom I purchased is now in London. (I am in India)\nWhen I restart the phone, it says this iPhone is currently linked to an appleID.\nWhen I asked the person what's the appleID of the phone, he says that it doesn't have any but the phone shows something like this :\n\nWhat do I do ?\nHow do I get my phone to work ?\nAnyone please help I also tried putting the phone in DFU mode (press home button + lock button) and then installed the ipsw through itunes, still the above screen appeared.\nWhat can I do ?\n\nA: Sadly, there is no other way to make your phone work. It has to be unlocked first by the Apple ID mentioned on the screen. You should have checked iCloud activation lock status of the phone before purchasing.\nIf you have the original receipt of the phone from the seller, then you can approach Apple to reset your phone. Otherwise, there is no way to unlock it.\n", "Q: Changes to Touch ID warning after restarting iPhone due to unresponsive app This morning I restarted my iPhone 7 due to an unresponsive app - Facebook, which does not use Touch ID. On restart I had to enter my passcode, which was to be expected after a reboot. \nI then tried to view some banking apps, which require Touch ID, the first required my passcode, rather than Touch ID, I thought this was strange, but carried on. The second banking app showed a Touch ID error. Going back to the first app showed the error below. \nI have not made any changes to Touch ID since setting up the phone months ago (at which point I filled all 5 slots for fingerprints), so am slightly concerned about this warning. \nWhat could have caused this message? And what is the safest course of action?\n\n\nA: This looks to be an issue with your bank's app. If I remember correctly, apps are notified anytime a touchID change is made, so things like 1Password will request your Master Password to sign in. This popup seems to be of your bank's design, and a software glitch made your phone think there was a change in TouchID.\nFor future reference, you can confirm that all fingers enrolled in touchID are yours by going to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode. Then scroll to the part of the pane where it shows your touchID fingerprints:\n\nNow, put each registered finger on the sensor and wait until the fingerprint is highlighted, like so:\n\nEnsure that each fingerprint is yours by making sure that your fingers highlight all of the fingerprint options.\nOr, you could just set touchID up again for all your fingers.\n", "Q: Apple MacBook Air stuck in continuous boot loop All of a sudden my MacBook Air has started continuously rebooting.

The machine is bound to Windows AD (with his profile as a mobile profile) and is managed by JSS.\nWe manage configuration policies through JSS, and they are closely monitored. I don't see anything different about his configurations than anyone else's.\nI've gone through what I would think would normally flush this out. First I had him remove the com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist from the Library. That didn't do it.\nThen the following removals,\nrm -r ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore \nrm -r ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.storeagent\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.appstore.plist\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.storeagent.plist\nrm ~/Library/Cookies/com.apple.appstore.plist\n\nAlso had him re-index Spotlight, https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201716\nNone of these items have remedied the issue.\nWith a pending Sierra update we'll be pushing out to users, we reckon that might fix it, too. But I'm wondering if there is something here that we've missed.\n\nA: Here is what we found. And it's not a completely satisfactory answer, I'm afraid. We had installed some software called PowerBroker, to give individual users the ability to do tasks they would normally need admin permissions to do. (This would allow limited tasks, such as updating Acrobat or their printers, etc.)\nThis user, being a developer, was testing this out. We had actually uninstalled PowerBroker, but something was left behind that continued to cause problems.\nWe actually \"fixed\" this by installing PowerBroker 1.3.1. Even after we had removed it earlier, and even though it was not doing privilege elevation, this installation fixed the issue. We did a deep into the OS, and none of the logs were specific about this. Very frustrating. We do have cases open with PowerBroker about this as well.\n", "Q: Headphones with inline mic mute button hangs up the call Any way to mute instead? I just have a cheap pair of wired headphones with an inline mic with a mute button. I'm using an old iPhone 5 since I just broke my Nexus 6 screen. In Android, this button was a very quick way to mute and un-mute calls, crucial during conference calls. I just tried this for the first time on the iPhone and it hung up the call instead. Is there anyway to change this behavior to mute instead?\n\nA: No, there's no way to change this.  I really don't like that Apple has decided the single-click on the headphone switch will disconnect the call instead of muting the microphone.\nYou can do what I have and go here to provide iPhone feedback to Apple to make this change.\n", "Q: Is possible to reset the timer on a disabled iPhone without Wi-Fi or Cellular?

I believe is actually grounded according to these pictures https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZndk.jpg https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ByBt.jpg\n\nA: All Power Supplies must meet 4 critieria\n\n\n*\n\n*1) Safety; for Hipot, leakage to earth and other things.\n\n*2) EMI compatibility\n\n*3) meet product requirements for  AC-DC or AC-RF mobile charger\n\n*4) Low Cost\n\n*Will they fail from a 6kV lightning transient? \n\n\n*\n\n*possibly (especially in Florida) but not 2~3kV according to regional product power standards in an area protected with line lightning arrestors\n\n\n*Are you safe from secondary breakdown and getting zapped\n\n*yes if they are compliant and there are no manufacturing defects.\n\n*all manufacturers are only required to do 100% Hipot and leakage tests but not EMI tests\n\n\nWhat about EMI?\n\n\n*\n\n*It is well defined in most countries but with the flooded online aftermarket of 3rd party power adapters, it's a gray zone.\n\n\nThe 3rd party or aftermarket chargers like OEM's are self-regulated and are not tested with every target device as OEM's are required to do. So compatibility with load noise and switcher noise may vary if the step load rates happen to interfere under some load condition. So hypothetically it may become a source of EMI if not an OEM supply or may not have the smart communication signals over DC power to identify the match to the target device.\nRadio and power line conducted interference requirements are well specified for consumer and commercial equipment.\nSusceptibility has long been a corporate standard and then included in CE standards.  The RF standard levels  are shown in a graph below. But there are more tests for Hipot, leakage current to ground wire , ESD damage and sometimes a few more. ( coke spill test, drop test, temp rise test, short circuit test)\nBeside converting AC to DC which usually generates a lot fast rise time current pulses, the purpose is to  minimize this \"egress\" going out and \"ingress from power line transients (PLT) and lightning noise.\nThere are many methods to this AC-DC conversion.  Long ago bricks just pumped high pulse currents just after a bridge rectifier peak voltage that had to be sustained until the next half cycle. These were notorious for causing external mic buzz issues on some 3rd party desk mics for laptops and even towers with ATX 50kHz SMPS converters.  The converters didn't radiate that far but far enough to be picked up by an unbalanced desktop mic plugged into an ungrounded mobile laptop or even a grounded desktop. Usually ok, but some were caused a buzz.\nThis is due the common mode stray EMI coupling into an unbalanced high impedance mic( or radio or other elctronic device nearby) and the receiving cable converts the CM noise into a differential voltage due to unbalanced impedance on signal vs ground.\nThe most common solution is a 2 way Pi Filter , sometimes in two stages. The winding balance is critical and the Y caps to earth ground are plastic high quality and rated for lightning transients for breakdown safety.\nNow you have notied that many mobiles with low power mobiles e.g. iPhones, iPads do not use 3 pronged plugs.  Instead they higher frequency Ac-DC converters where the CM noise can be absorbed in the lossy ferrite CM choke instead of being shunt from CM choke to earth ground.\nEmission levels\n\nAn example of some 2 pronged AC-DC noise filters ( PLT protection not shown)\n\nThis does not mean ALL 2 pronged mobile chargers are compliant to conducted/radiated ingress/egress but many are such as Apple's.\nSo don't be worried. Just be aware of the requirements and possible EMI and susceptibility to damage or interference from lightning or power line transients and changes to local standards in your country.\nJust beware of of the requirements and 3rd party chargers that have not been certified with your equipment.  It may be OK, so trust  but verify or don't trust. \nYour choice.\nedit\nContent References: all from my experience as an EE since 1975 doing R&D, Test Eng , CMS and EMI testing.\nImage references: https://interferencetechnology.com/practical-reasons-for-shifting-to-the-application-of-dielectric-independent-emi-filters-with-integral-surge-protection-in-product-designs/\n", "Q: Can the CIA hack my iphone if I have the latest firmware installed? I've been watching the news lately about these WikiLeaks about the CIA. Can the CIA hack my iPhone with the latest iOS version installed? How do they do this if my iOS is a closed system and Apple has to verify all software that is installed?\n\nA: The iOS hacks are specifically tied to jailbroken phones and phones running old software.

Once downloaded, while MS says it's 4.6GB - it's clearly 4.8GB so I can't make a DVD (I don't have any DVD+R DL media).  So I try the ISO to USB. Old Bootcamp Assistant (like from Yosemite) can make a bootable USB from the ISO, but it doesn't work right as BCA is running on different hardware.  New Bootcamp on El Cap or Sierra won't make a bootable USB from an image period. Tried Disk Utility, hdutil and dd of which it just immediately fails when trying to write the USB. I then tried the Windows 7 ISO to USB utility from Microsoft (running inside VMWare) - and it at least got the ISO restored to the USB, however it's not bootable.  The Windows Install USB drive I did make is mountable under Windows in VMWare and macOS 10.9 - 10.12. It's just not showing up as an option to boot to when holding the option key at boot.\nProblem 2: Bootcamp can't seem to create a 3rd partition on my drive from the free space to install Windows\nLaunch BCA, it does its thing by building a driver disk for 20 minutes and then goes to prep a partition. It sees 2 partitions and no free space. Even if I go back and create the partition BCA doesn't see the partition and no other partition is marked usable. \nSo I'm at the nexus of not quite sure how to proceed.\nHas anyone added Windows as a 3rd partition on a Mac? How did you do that? \nHow are folks creating Mac bootable Windows install media?\nAny advice much appreciated. \n\nA: Here are the two issues you are facing:\nIssue #1:\nDisk utility shows you only two partitions, but in reality you have four; an EFI partition, and the OS X recovery partition are both hidden. Since Windows XP and Vista didn't support EFI in those days, Apple had to emulate a legacy BIOS to support Windows on that model. A legacy PC BIOS only supports MBR partitions, and MBR disks only have four entries in the partition table. Bootcamp can't create another partition that Windows would be able to see.\nIssue #2:\nMicrosoft didn't officially support installing Windows from USB until Windows 8 came out in 2012. It was totally possible (and even easy) before that, but since Microsoft didn't support it, Apple didn't support it either. After Apple ditched the optical drives in their computers, USB was the only other way to get Windows on there, so finally Apple started supporting it. But they didn't backport the fix to earlier models so you're stuck with installing from DVD.\nSo here are your options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can sacrifice that 2nd partition you have and then Boot Camp will work normally.\n\n*You can delete the recovery partition. There are guides online on how to do this. It involves the command line. Also you have to flatten your CoreStorage volumes. Apple definitely doesn't support this but OS X works fine without it as long as you do it correctly.\n\n*You can find an older version of the Win10 ISO. The version you likely have is the Anniversary Update (build 1607). If you can find a 1507 or 1511 build, those will fit on a standard DVD. Once installed, you'll be upgraded to 1607 via Windows Update.\n\n\nOne more thing...\nThere are also guides out there on installing Windows in UEFI mode on a Mac. Don't do this. Your model doesn't support that and it's more trouble that it's worth. You'll run into video and audio issues (if you have dual GPUs).\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Mac laptop master password problems I've created a Master password  in my Mac laptop it says this password can override any account and be used instead of their original password but it doesn't work The admin account I don't have the password\n\nA: The master password cannot be used in place of any user's password, it can be used to reset any user's password from the login screen. Just try to log in with the wrong password, and it should show an option to reset it with the master password.\nIf you're not seeing that, and you have FileVault turned on, you may be looking at the pre-boot authentication screen instead of the login screen (they look very similar). The master password cannot be used a the FileVault pre-boot authentication screen, but a FileVault recovery key can (if you selected that option when enabling FileVault), or linked iCloud account can (if you selected the \"Allow my iCloud account to unlock the disk\" option instead). Alternately, if you have another (non-admin) account, you could log in with that at the pre-boot authentication screen, then log out to the regular login screen.\n", "Q: Can't connect to App Store on iPhone 6s when on Wi-Fi I don't understand why this is happening now. This was never a problem.\nI have tried the following without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset network settings.\n\n*Make sure the date/time are correct — they are.\n\n*Reset my internet modem.\n\n*Sign out of Apple ID for iTunes, then sign back in.\nWhat worked was turning off my Wi-Fi.\nHere's my problem with that though: why would Apple make you turn off your Wi-Fi for you to update your apps and software, or even to sign in using an Apple ID? Why do I need to use my Mobile data to update my phone?\nApparently it's because of my DNS. When adding DNS 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, everything started to work. I replaced some IP address with the 8.8.4.4.\nWhy was this happening? Why was there a different IP address in there? Why now? never had this happen to me in a decade.\n\nA: This is nothing to do with Apple and Apple do not have any problem with you using Wi-Fi for connecting to the App Store. Your DNS was likely provided by your ISP, which seems to have been having trouble routing the Apple domains. By changing the DNS to Google's DNS which can perform the routing correctly, the problem is resolved. I suggest you contact whoever provided your previous DNS.\n", "Q: iPhone SE: USB sound input -> bluetooth speaker? I would like to hear the output from my old turntable in my bluetooth speaker through an iPhone or iPad.  I need help on how to get it working.\nI have an iPhone SE, a bluetooth speaker which is paired with the iPhone (music works), a UFO202 USB RIAA amplifier connected with a newly purchased Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter (to have enough power for the USB device and also keep the phone charged)\nI can hear the audio when the UFO202 is attached to my MacBook Pro (and transmit it if the Mac is paired with the speaker).\nI installed Garageband on the iPhone and the UFO202 appears to be recognized as Garageband send modified sound back into the UFO202 (which I can hear in the headphone jack there).  This did not appear to send anything over bluetooth but I am not familiar with Garageband.\nSo the only piece missing is how I can make the iPhone take the USB input sound and send to the bluetooth speaker?  Can Garageband do it?  Memos?  Do I need a third part app?\n\nA: Audiobus v3 has been launched and this may be all you need.\nThe app already supports Garageband (along with hundreds of others) and they provide an SDK (software development kit) for other app developers. This too has been updated to support new functionality included in version 3.\nWhat I do know\n\n\n*\n\n*I know of someone who owns the Behringer UCA202 (not the Behringer UFO202) and has used that to route incoming audio from a guitar via a genuine Apple Lightning to USB Camera Adapter to an iPad 4 and then outputting that audio via GarageBand using the Audiobus app.\n\n*While it's not the same Behringer unit as you have, my understanding is that the only real difference is that the Behringer UFO202 you have foregoes the digital stereo out to provide a switchable PHONO input for old turntables such as yours.\n\n*Also, I remember them having issues at first until they used a genuine Apple Lightning to USB Camera Adapter. They couldn't get it to work with a cheaper 3rd party adapter.\nWhat I don't know\n\n\n*\n\n*Whether this person has ever used this process to route the audio from the iPad to an external Bluetooth speaker. This is something I will try to determine. \n\n*The only other thing I'm not 100% certain of is whether they used anything else to get this to work, but from memory it was just a combination of the Behringer UCA202, a genuine Apple Lightning to USB Camera Adapter, the Audiobus app and GarageBand.\nIf that's the case, then you should find that what you want to do is possible with Audiobus and GarageBand. \n[Update]\nOkay, this is what I've since learnt after originally posting this answer.\nAs I mentioned previously, I know of someone who owns a Behringer UCA202. Now, it seems they did try for a little while to route music to a Bluetooth speaker, but with mixed (mainly not good) results. They tried doing this via Audiobus directly and in conjunction with other apps.\nThis prompted direct contact with Audiobus support and below is a quote from the support email they got back:\n\nSorry, Audiobus does not play well with Bluetooth speakers. I cannot\n  recommend using Audiobus for this use case. Bluetooth audio is always\n  terrible for live audio, because it adds latency. That’s why we’re not\n  supporting it. Any wired speaker will do - they don’t have any issues.\n\nAs routing music wasn't their main use case (they were mainly interested in recording guitars), they didn't pursue it. However, if I was in your shoes, it may be worth trying Audiobus in conjunction with a 3.5mm to Bluetooth transmitter. I'd wait for Audiobus 3 to be released first, and then I'd look at transmitters such as this. (Note: This is just one I picked at random - I have no affiliation with the seller or product).\nMy thinking is that Audiobus will see something like this as a wired speaker and that this could result in you achieving what you want.\nObviously, only you can decide whether the costs of buying the app and transmitter are worth the expense, especially since it's purely to experiment with and with no guarantee of success. \nHopefully someone else will come up with a confirmed solution, but if not this may be it. All the best with it.\n", "Q: Finding Peak Memory Bandwidth on MacBook Pro I am required to find the peak memory bandwidth for a 2016 MacBook Pro. Where can I find this information?\n\nA: Your 2016 MacBook, depending on the model, uses either 1866 or 2133 DDR3 memory (1866 is used by the non-touchbar model, the others use 2133.)\nThis number refers to the data rate of the memory, in MT/s (millions of transfers per second) per channel. DDR3 specifies a 64 bit wide bus, and MacBooks utilize dual channel memory: thus, the total memory bandwidths are 238.848 Gb/s (29.856 GB/s) and 273.024 Gb/s (34.128 GB/s.) Note however that all of these computers use LPDDR3, which may result in lower than advertised bandwidth. In practice, you probably won't seem these speeds, but it provides an upper limit.\nIf you'd like to test the bandwidth, Novabench offers features to test the actual bandwidth of your machine, though there seem to be mixed results based on reviews (Novabench reported 15.6% of my theoretical speed, which seems suspiciously low.) You may have better luck with Bandwidth, though you'll have to install dependencies and compile it yourself.\nPrimary source.\n", "Q: Can I swap an Apple SSD from one laptop to another? I have a liquid spill on my previous MacBook Pro 2014 Retina 15ʺ MGXC2LL/A.\nThe logic board is dead and fixing it does not make any sense. But the SSD has all data saved and a technician told that it's fine and safe.\nIf I purchase another MacBook Pro 2014 MGXC2LL/A with same SSD, CPU etc, can I just switch the SSD card? I want to get my profile, apps and all data. \nOr is it too dangerous and it can wipe all the data? I heard that every piece of hardware have their own serial number and I can't just switch them between laptops.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure it will work by just swapping the SSD. But remember a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will void the warranty by opening up the laptop\n\n*You might break the laptop if you are not experienced in opening it up.\nI would just recommend a USB SSD drive enclosure like this one (definitely not the best one but it works). Then transfer all the datas from the old SSD to the new one. Plus you can use the old SSD as an external storage.\n\nA: This would probably work OK, but it would probably be easier to just mount the drive externally and copy your files over to the new machine. That way, you wouldn't need to open up the new machine and install the old SSD.\nYou could mount the SSD on the new machine with something like this: Seagate Backup Plus Desktop Thunderbolt Adapter https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009HQCAPQ/\n", "Q: List all keys added to keychain using `security add-generic-password` Is there a command in security that lists the names of all keys that have been added to the keychain through add-generic-password?\nI've tried, but it find-generic-password only ever returns one result as far as I know.\n\nA: As of 2021-11-25, there is no flag in security to output only the keys so you have to get the whole list and then look for the relevant value:\nsecurity dump-keychain | awk -F'=' '/0x00000007/ { print $2 }'\n\nLearn more about awk pattern matching.\n", "Q: Is there a service that allows distributing iOS builds per git branches? All the beta services I've looked into (TestFlight, HockeyApp, Fabric beta, Test, DeloyGate, ...) seem to only allow one \"active\" build per app, or one per version (the actual x.x.x version and nothing else).\nFor QA purposes, I would like to be able to publish builds per branch of my github repo. Ideally, testers would have an interface where they could install the last build of branch feature/money or feature/coins, with everything else that is already offered by regular services (push notifications, UDID handling if not using enterprise certificates, ...)\nDoes this exist?\n\nA: This might not work for your use case, but because we try to merge to master frequently and not leave branches around for very long, we have had really good luck with this methodology.\nWe are using Azure DevOps as our build tool, and pushing builds into AppCenter.ms as our distribution tool for non-release builds. For release builds we push to the App Store directly.\nAppCenter.ms allows you to create \"Distribution Groups\", which are basically a list of the email addresses you want to receive notifications when a new build is uploaded that \"targets\" that group. Each group has a unique GUID and if you use Azure DevOps and their .azure-pipelines.yml (or manually configure a build through the UI, though that is a very laborious process), you can  use the AppCenter task with a condition that checks the branch name and deploys to specific group IDs based on the branch being built.\nOne of the things that makes this easier for us is we are using \"enterprise distribution certificates\", since these don't require individual device enrollment like ad hoc or developer certificates do. The other piece that could be important, if a user may install versions of the app from different groups you MUST have a different Bundle ID (and therefore another provisioning profile) for each version, otherwise they will clobber each other on the user's device. This is an Apple requirement (but Android has a similar unique bundle naming requirement).\nIn our case because these live in our Enterprise (not public AppStore) account, we have com.company.appname.test and com.company.appname.prodtest which for our purposes execute the same code, but they target different backend environments(URLs) for our APIs.\n", "Q: Is there a way to have an interactive / editable desktop background (E.g.: A spreadsheet) on a Macbook? The title basically gives the gist of what I am curious about, but to explain more: I wanted to set up a system where I track various things, such as my habits, mood, and tasks every day. I was planning to keep all of this in an Excel spreadsheet. I thought that it would be great if I could make the document where I keep track of this easily visible, so I will remember to edit it every day, and also because it would be easier to access and edit.\nThrough Googling, I found that at one point in time it was possible to embed an interactive spreadsheet as your desktop wallpaper in Windows. It involved saving the Excel spreadsheet as a webpage (.htm or .html), checking an option called \"Add Interactivity\", and the document could be set as the desktop background, and it would be editable from there (allegedly). The feature(s) that allowed this in Excel back then don't seem to be available in the 2016 version of Excel for Mac. So, is there a different way to do this now? Or is there some type of desktop Widget I could use as a Spreadsheet? I'm flexible about solutions, so any ideas would be appreciated!\n\nA: Check out desktopr and add a link to a Google sheet. \nThe service allows you to set any website as your wallpaper. Heard about it on Product Hunt.\n\nA: I made an app for this. It's free and open-source: https://github.com/sindresorhus/Plash It lets you set any website as your desktop wallpaper.\n\nA: I don't think there's anything that directly involves Excel, but you could look in the Apple Dashboard Widgets store. Then again, Apple could be phasing out the Dashboard, considering how tricky it is to enable it in Sierra. Other than that, keeping a small window or a separate desktop open is the only option I'm aware of.\n", "Q: Why can't I restrict all from executing a folder?

Then it turned out the files are needed. I erased my drive with the fastest option and didn't installed anything on it yet except the os so I think most of the data should be recoverable. What's the best possible way to recover the erased data?\n\nA: The first is to stop using the computer right away.\nThen make a complete bit-for-bit backup copy of the disk. Either boot the Mac in Recovery and create the backup from there, or take out the disk and use a seperate computer to create the backup.\nAfter you have cloned the drive, you should perform recovery attempts on the cloned copy only!\nUsually this is doing using specialized data recovery software. Both free and paid programs exists for multiple platforms - you can use for example a free Linux system to recovery files from an OS X system - it doesn't have to be a Mac program.\nThe best software to use depends on how much you want to spend, what kind of files you're looking to recover and how your disk was formatted before you erased it. Specially which type of partition table did you have, which type of file system did you have - and was the disk encrypted.\nIf you disk was encrypted with File Vault you'll probably have a very hard time ever getting anything recovered.\n", "Q: How to boot and install Linux or BSD on a 2007 MacBook White via USB? I have an old MacBook white (Model 2,1 mid-late 2007) which won't upgrade beyond Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6). I have previously installed Debian with a dual boot by using rEFIt and booting from a DVD disk, but the DVD drive doesn't seem to reliably read disks anymore\nI would like to install Debian or BSD on this MacBook, either as a dual boot, or as the single OS -- alternatively, any current linux distro or even Windows 10 would do.\nI have tried a few things, all without success. For the record:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn .iso (or .cdr) image to DVD (Mac won't read disk)\n\n*Create a live Debian USB (with MBR partition) with rEFIt\n\n*Create live Debian USB with Mac Linux USB Loader (will boot on newer Macs, but not on MacBook2,1)\n\n\nI've seen something about manually putting a GPT table on the USB drive, or creating a separate EFI partition, but since it's more technical and time consuming I didn't get around to it.\nMain question: is there a reliable way to boot and install Linux, BSD, Windows (anything not OS X)?\nBonus points for running the OS live from the USB -- since after 10 years HD may fail some time soon.\nThanks for helping with recycling an old friend and protecting the environment.\nEDIT: both replies, as well as all HOWTOs I could find operate under the assumption that I should be able to hold 'opt' on boot and choose the USB stick. That's not what happens when I have BSD or Linux there, but I am able to choose a USB stick with Mac OS X and install from it.\nSo the question becomes, what is the difference that prevents that from being done with Linux/BSD?\n\nA: I personally installed FreeBSD on a G4 machine via USB, so I don't see why you can't do that with a 2007 MacBook.\nBut going back to the original question\n\nis there a reliable way to boot and install Linux, BSD, Windows (anything not OS X)?\n\nYes.  There is a site called Linux on Laptops (I linked the Apple section) that outlines what laptops are compatible with Linux.    Specifically for Debian, they have a Wiki that describes exactly how to install it on a Mac.\nAs mentioned before, I am partial to BSD.  FreeBSD has USB images specific to UEFI machines available for download.  \nThere is also excellent HOWTOs available to assist you in this process.\nAs for your \"Bonus Question\"...\n\nBonus points for running the OS live from the USB -- since after 10\n  years HD may fail some time soon.\n\nWhy would you do this and not replace the hard drive? \nA SATA1 interface is 1.5Gb/s\nA USB2.0 port is 480Mb/s\nRough math tells us USB is 1/3 the speed of a drive.  A brand new SanDisk SSD is less than $50 online.  It doesn't make sense to sacrifice that much performance for that small price.\n\nA: A bit late but I hope this can help someone. I have a 2,1 (mid-2007) macbook that refuses to boot from anything that isn't an Mac OS X installer. The DVD drive is dead which is a problem that I suspect its common on old laptops. It also refused to boot a 32 bit linux installer from external DVD drive. With and without refind.\nAnyway I've managed to install Ubuntu 16 LTS using a weird method that can vary from distro to distro. It might also work on *BSD as long as refind has a driver to read its partition. In any case you will need some advanced knowledge about whatever you are trying to install.\n\n\n*\n\n*Have Mac OS X Lion on a bare minimum partition. I think 20GB is enough. You'll have to live with that on your drive and stuff like firmware updates can make a difference so I recommend installing all the Lion upates.\n\n*Install refind. Be sure to include the correct driver (or all the drivers with the --alldrivers option).\n\n*Create a partition using the remaining space. I don't think you can create empty partitions with diskutil. Other tools like fdisk and gpart might work but in the end you just need a partition. In my case that partition was /dev/disk0s4.\n\n*Make sure to unmount that partition. You can dd some zeroes into it to prevent Mac OS X from mounting it again.\n\n*Install virtualbox. The latest version that can work on Lion is 4.3.40.\n\n*Chown the partition to current user. This is required for the next step.\n\n*Create a VMDK from our partition's block device. In my case the command was \"VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /Users/ulzeraj/VirtualBox\\ VMs/rootfs.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk0s4\"\n\n*Create a virtual machine using the raw vmdk as its virtual disk and install your desired 32 bit Linux distribution as if you were installing a simple VM. The only catch is to install it on /dev/sda (no partitions - remember that you are already inside a partition). I can guess that some installers might not be happy with this. The installer may also complain about not using swap but you can fix this later.\nI've used Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I had to use the livecd mode to format /dev/sda as EXT4. When prompted about where to install a boot loader I've selected to continue without a bootloader.\nIf everything went fine refind will detect your new OS and boot it by running the kernel. Legacy mode doesn't work because we don't have a boot loader.\n\nA: Your Macbook seems to be 64-bit EFI and 64-bit CPU. So the best reliable way is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot USB stick in EFI mode. You must use the amd64 iso. It supports EFI and BIOS (legacy CSM) mode. 32-bit supports only BIOS mode. You don't need Mac Linux USB Loader or anything special. UNetbootin seems to be OK.\n\n*Install Linux or BSD\n\n*Optional: install rEFInd (not rEFIt - now old) from OS X after the successful OS install. Don't worry, rEFInd knows that you already have rEFIt and it will take care of everything. \n\n\nI have seen this: a Mac that has 4 USB ports. It boots from only one. Maybe you need find the friendly port too?\n", "Q: Safari lost half my extensions and passwords after a system crash The crash was logged into console\nand it caused logout from my system.\nAfter I've logged in again Safari lost most of my passwords and extensions.\nI've already looked at this and it didn't help.\nI'm using iCloud Keychain and I've checked on my phone - the passwords are still there. I also looked into ~/Library/Safari/Extensions/ and all my extensions are still there, just not visible in safari preferences.\nI've tried using Time Machine on ~/Library/Safari/ but it also didn't work.\nI have to say that this is very annoying since it happened to me at least 3 times in past 2 years.\n1) What can I do to restore all my iCloud passwords? \n2) What can I do to restore all my Safari extensions without installing them again one-by-one?\n3) What can I do to stop this from occurring again?\nI guess 3) is too much to ask for, but I need at least a reliable procedure that can restore everything to the state it was before.\nI'm also not the only person affected by this problem - my cousin turned to 1-Password exactly because of this behaviour.\n\nA: As you may have noticed from my question, I was very determined to find a solution and finally I found one. If you have a Time Machine setup then you're lucky. All you need to do is to restore those 4 folders (remember to select all the contents from the backup) to the time before the crash.\n~/Library/Safari/Extensions/\n~/Library/Keychains\n/Library/Keychains\n/System/Library/Keychains\n(Probably not all are needed, but this worked for me)\nRestart and open safari to check that everything is on place.

The new MacBook Pro 15 supports two 5K displays or four 4K displays. My question is if it will support a triple display configuration with one 5K and two 4K displays(all displays being the LG Ultrafines), the PPI is almost the same so it will be great if this works out ?\n\nA: Short answer\nYes, this should be fine.\nLong answer\nIt's not just about whether they're 4K or 5K displays, it's also about the resolution you run them at and possibly if you connect multiple displays on the same physical side since this KB mentions for two 5K displays, they must be connected on opposite sides of the hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207448 - LG UltraFine 5K Display\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207447 - LG UltraFine 4K Display\n\n\nOfficially, your model MBP supports up to two displays at 5120x2880 pixels at 60 Hz or up to four displays at 4096x2304 pixels at 60 Hz, one on the left Thunderbolt 3 bus, one on the right Thunderbolt 3 bus.\nYour model MBP comes with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 530 GPU and either an AMD Radeon Pro 450, 455, or 460. The integrated Intel HD Graphics 530 GPU will use up to 1.5 GB of your main RAM, while both the Radeon Pro 450 and 455 have 2 GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory and the Radeon Pro 460 has 4 GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory.\nAt the risk of oversimplifying things, assuming you intend to run the 5K display at 5120x2880 pixels and both 4K displays at 4096x2304 pixels, this equates to a total of 33,619,968 pixels. This is actually less than the 37,748,736 pixels you'd need to power if you were using four 4K displays at 4096x2304. This assumes you intend to use your MBP in clamshell mode, as opposed to also powering the internal display and the external display simultaneously. \nObviously, if you have the Radeon Pro 460 your MBP will manage this configuration better than it would with one of the other GPUs. However, all GPUs should be fine - it's just that if you have the Radeon Pro 460 there will be less heat produced and therefore your fans won't need to spin as fast. Finally, if you have the Radeon Pro 460 then you'll be able to simultaneously manage more graphics intensive tasks on all displays more smoothly than you would with one of the others.\n\nA: The official support states up to four 4K displays or two 5K displays.\nSo theoretically one 5K and two 4Ks should be fine. \n", "Q: Apple Pages: Use a different header for odd an even pages In Apple Pages, is it possible to use a different header for odd and even pages?\nI have searched around and found this guide, but I think it's for the old version of Pages (as it is from 2006 and have the interfaces buttons mentioned don't exist).\nThere are also guides on how to use different headers for different sections, but that is different from odd and even pages. \n\nA: This is currently not possible with Pages, as it was with Pages '09.\nIf you need this functionality, you can still use Pages '09 if you have it, but opening a document from Pages '09 with different headers for odd and even pages will cause such headers to be removed (and a warning thrown in Document Warnings).\nYou can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/pages.html\n\nA: 2021 here, and yes, it is possible (again) with Pages (v. 11.1).\nYou can set the document to have a double page layout:\n\n*\n\n*select document pane in the top right\n\n*under document, find the options for the margins of the document\n\n*activate double page checkbox\n\nNow you can set different headers for even / odd pages (most useful for pagination at the left / right respectively):\n\n*\n\n*again, make sure you selected the document pane (top right)\n\n*under section, find the options for the header and footer\n\n*activate the checkbox for different left/right layout.\n\nPS: if any of my translations from my german version of Pages are a bit off, I am very sorry.\n", "Q: 2011 MacBook wakes immediately on sleeping, even after change of HD and OS I have a 2011 MacBook Pro. About six months ago it developed a sleep problem - it wakes immediately on sleeping. Occasionally when recently rebooted it will sleep as it ought, but usually not. On each waking, the log says this:\nlocalhost kernel[0]: (AppleACPIPlatform) Wake reason: ?\nNot helpful!\nI've done all the obvious things (network, bluetooth, USB) and tried to reset PRAM and SMC, though the latter doesn't seem actually to reset.\nMore info which might be relevant - occasionally when the Mac is powered off and I plug in the charger, it boots.\nLast week the original HD failed and I had a SSD installed. I also upgraded the OS from Snow Leopard to Sierra. The fault has persisted through both these changes. This leads me to wonder if this is a hardware issue.\nOnly other info about the machine is that it suffered the degrading-solder problem common to 2011 MacBooks. Since it happened before the Apple Repair scheme kicked in, I had it resoldered by a third-party.\nThanks for any help!\nEdit: Further to this: a few things I've found: a process called 'hidd' is listed as Preventing Sleep in the Activity Monitor. Its parent is called 'launchd (1)'. And \npmset -g assertions\n\ngives the following:\nIdle sleep preventers: IODisplayWrangler\n\nAnd finally - when I put the computer to sleep, it very briefly sleeps (1s or so), but then HD starts up again. The sleep light goes off, and does not wink or re-light, but the display stays off. To 'wake' it again takes 10-15 seconds.\n\nA: Since you're not actually sure if the SMC reset did anything, I'd reset both the NVRAM and SMC again (and in that order) using the steps below. \nBefore doing so, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset the NVRAM on your particular MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the SMC on your particular MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if the issue still persists. IF it does, then test the hardware as per the instructions below.\nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\n", "Q: Sign flat package with non-Apple certificate I have a program that I ported from the Windows environment to macOS. I would like to sign the flat installer .pkg with the same certificate I used on Windows, which is valid and granted by DigiCert.\nI created a keychain in Keychain Access, imported the certificate and saved it locally as company.keychain.

Some drops of pure water were sprayed on the keyboard of my 2010 MacBook Air. I immediately tried to dry all of it with a cloth, then turned it upside dow, but open, an put it near the heating, so the rest could dry as well. After a few hours, I tried if it still worked and it did, except that the Alt key was electronically stuck, i.e. always treated as hold down. I tried a reboot, with the power cable connected, which also worked fine, but I could not log in, likely because the key was still stuck and thus my password was invalid. I let it dry some more with the lid closed. When I next opened it, however, the computer would not turn on at all. This has not changed after three more days.\nI fear that something important short-circuited, but I still hope that only the keyboard is not working, including the power key. Is there any way to find out  for sure before opening up the case?\n\nA: You could first try to reset the SMC, which you can find out about here.  If you the LED indicator on your MagSafe charger does not change, then you can assume that at least the keyboard is broken.  It really would be best to open the case and either reconnect the battery or inspect the keyboard's connection to the logic board.\n", "Q: can't install iCloud Drive on iPhone 7 I just got an iPhone 7 from my job. Being more of an Android/Linux guy, I am actually very impressed by this device. One thing is very strange though: I can't find/acces the iCloud Drive app! When I ask Siri, it says that it isn't installed, and suggests that I install it. When I click the linked provided, there is the little icon with an cloud, but it is \"toned out\" in the colors, and nothing happens when I click it. I don't understand what I'm suppose to do about this. \nThe reason I need iCloud in the first place is to backup my phone (also \"toned out\" in the Settings → iCloud menu) and to use the \"Just Press Record\" app, which requires iCloud, and when I start the app it tells me I need to enable iCloud Drive first. Which I can't do. \nUpdate: Under settings, there is an iCloud settings, which informs me that I have 5 GB storage and that Photos is using a little bit of it.\nUnder \"Restrictions\", it doesn't have anything registrered (which is the only possible cause provided by Just Press Records support FAQ. \nI am logged into my apple account.

If you are going to answer that there are no such shortcuts, please point me to some reliable evidence like an official article on Apple’s website, or a full list of all existing shortcuts in latest version of macOS etc.\nAlso, my question is about default shortcuts in a freshly-installed system, not for custom settings, tweaking DefaultKeyBinding.dict file, using third-party keyboard managers etc.\n\nA: The characters you mention are not available on the US layout.  Apple does not publish a list of all the shortcuts, but you can use the Keyboard Viewer to see what each key does.  This list is old but probably still accurate.\nThe standard way to access them would be via the Character Viewer (Edit > Emoji & Symbols).

And newer Mac laptops none of the above.\nAt one time I had heard of Mac laptops with video cards that were on a daughter card of sorts. So theoretically replaceable but no one ever made a replacement to my knowledge.\nThis is becoming more and more common to find laptops from other manufacturers where there is little, if anything to upgrade. It is (probably?) a side-effect of the push for smaller/lighter making modular parts less and less of a reasonable (from an engineering/design standpoint) option.\nSo essentially what Tetsujin is correct: you have no upgrade path for system boards, CPUs and the like.\n\nA: I replaced my MacBook Pro 2009 13” Logicboard with a MacBook Pro 2010 Logicboard with success.

I subscribed to iTunes Match a few days ago and it is obvious to me that it will not upload my entire library i.e. it only seems to be matching my library with songs only available in the iTunes store. For example, I have quite a few CD's of my own that are not available in iTunes Music Australia and I can see that iTunes Match is not allowing these tunes to be played on other devices, even Apple Devices! They are appearing 'greyed out' and won't play.\nMy understanding from subscribing to this service was that it didn't matter what songs you had in your library, it would upload ALL of your music (that's right, it said EVEN your own CD's when signing up). \nThis, to me, is a hoax. They don't actually Match everything if it is not available in the iTunes Store.\nDoes anyone out there have any answers? I have read quite a few threads out there, I have tried updating iCloud Music Library, unchecking and checking iCloud in preferences and to be honest there does not appear to be any other way to allow my own personal CD music to show in Apple Play unless it is available in the iTunes Store.\nIf this is indeed the case then there is absolutely no point in me subscribing to iTunes Match for $35.99 a year. I may as well just stick with the regular music streaming service at $11.99 per month.\n\nA: Apple scans your library, if it identifies your file as part of the iTunes Store collection, it will 'match' it. If not, it uploads the file to your cloud. In your iTunes library you should see an iCloud icon next to your filenames - use the Show View options to add the column 'iCloud Status' - that will tell you if the song has been matched, uploaded, or waiting. Check if your CD uploads are in the correct format to sync. \nIf you right click on the song there's an option to 'Remove download' - this will delete your file off your local device. If you make a backup of your  current library, you could 'remove download' for your entire iTunes Match library - all the music should be stored in iCloud, and if it's matched, it will play the iTunes Store quality version. Sometimes there's issues with multiple devices on the same iTunes account conflicting sync.\n\nA: The answer to your question is no. Apple DOES upload songs that are not in iTunes Store/Apple Music, and DOES make them available if you have iCloud Music Library available on both iTunes and the iDevice. There are limitations (maximum 100,000 songs, and the audio files must be of a minimum bitrate, and a minimum and maximum size), and there are bugs, but it does work.\nThis is available to both Apple Music subscribers, and iTunes Match subscribers. (Apple Music includes the functionality of iTunes Match).\n", "Q: Can you connect two pairs of airpods to one computer at once I would like to watch a movie with a friend, but silently.

This type of current is very feeble and does not result in any shock to the body or cause any harm to the hardware components. But it is annoying. I zero-ed in on the faulty grounding of the electrical outlet. I had to run an extra grounding wire to discharge extra / spiked voltage from my power outlet into the fan loop made of iron in my ceiling. After that the problem is solved.\n\nA: I had a similar problem several years ago. It was suggested that I use the Power Adapter Extension Cable with the power cable as it has a 3 prongs and goes to ground.

Here is a line from my AppleScript that speaks the selected text:\nset this_say_Pid to do shell script \"LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbpaste -Prefer txt | say > /dev/null 2>&1 & echo $!\"\n\nI would like the speaking volume to be much lower. I would prefer not to accomplish this by decreasing my overall system volume.\nI can successfully decrease the volume of say in Terminal with the following code:\nsay \"[[volm 0.35]] This is a sentence\"\n\nBut, when I insert [[volm 0.35]] in my do shell script string, the volume does not change.\n\nA: Since you are piping the output of the pbpaste command directly to say command, then e.g. [[volm 0.35]] would need to be a part of what's on the clipboard as e.g. [[volm 0.35]] must precede the content of what was actually going to be said.\nI'd try using the following in place of what you are using:\nset howLoudAndWhatToSay to \"[[volm 0.35]] \\\"\" & (get the clipboard as string) & \"\\\"\"\n\nset this_say_Pid to do shell script \"say \" & howLoudAndWhatToSay & \" > /dev/null 2>&1 & echo $!\"\n\n\nUpdate: If you want to stick with using pbpaste, then this example command should work:\nset this_say_Pid to (do shell script \"echo \\\"[[volm 0.35]] $(LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbpaste -Prefer txt)\\\" | say > /dev/null 2>&1 & echo $!\")\n\nNote the primary differences between the command within the do shell script \"...\" command in your question and my answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*echo \\\"[[volm 0.35]] is added in front of LANG=... and note the space after ]].\n\n*The LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbpaste -Prefer txt is now enclosed in $(...) which is using Command Substitution to, in essence, concatenate what gets echoed to the pipe ahead of the say command.\n\n*As well as a matching closing literal double-quote \\\", before the pipe to say,  to go with the one in echo \\\"[[volm 0.35]].  It did work in limited testing without the use of the opening and closing double-quotes however it's probably better to encase it in the double-quotes to account for something the shell might try to unnecessarily expand.\nThat said, on my system using 0.35 for the value in [[volm 0.35]] didn't work well in that is was difficult to perceive the difference in volume from my normal setting. However using 0.3 in [[volm 0.3]] the difference was notable.

I keep deleting it to save update bandwidth, but it is there repeatedly.  \nI know the workaround is to skip its update, but due to circumstances, I have to go some time between updates, and it is quite convenient to \"update all\" instead of tapping one or two dozen choices.\nSo how do I completely get rid of this thing?\n\nA: If the update was pending when it was deleted or something similar, then the various lists of what is installed or needs to be undated may have gotten out of wack. \nPerhaps reinstalling it, updating it, and when there are no updates pending, then deleting it, might be effective. \n", "Q: Are IOS apps able to update in pieces? I remember (perhaps wrongly) an AirBNB update being several megabytes, implying the entire app.  Today's update is only 129 KB.

Is it possible to hide an application from Spotlight? \nI have an annoyance of sorts. This will probably seem trivial to others, but it happens to me enough that I find it rather frustrating. I have Quicken and of course, Quicktime is bundled with macOS. If I bring up spotlight and start typing quic it is showing quicken. But if I proceed to put in the \"k\" before hitting enter, spotlight switches from Quicken to Quicktime and that's what ends up getting opened. Often there is just enough of a delay that I see Quicken while pressing enter. \nSince I do not use Quicktime at all (vlc person), I would just force uninstall it, but it seems like there should be a way to hide applications from spotlight or give some applications priority over others.\n\nA: Spotlight learns from your actions. The more you choose QuickTime for a certain input, the more that result will appear as the Top Hit for that search phrase. Try typing your phrase which shows QuickTime first, then choose Quicken. Keep doing this and it will learn that you want Quicken instead. This might take a few tries depending on how many times you incorrectly taught it first.\nAlternatively, you can prevent something from appearing in Spotlight by adding it to the Privacy list. Open System Preferences → Spotlight, choose the Privacy tab, then drag QuickTime Player.app from Applications into this list.\n", "Q: What is a safer way to write this applescript I sometimes use a third party application with a built in terminal when writing and/or testing a script.

I currently run Sierra on a late 2013 MBP (Retina). I want to set up an environment where I can learn and experiment with programming in a Mac environment without the risk of doing damage or making a mess, so using a VM sounds like the way forward. I don't know much about VMs beyond setting them up; what I'm wondering is - applications and tasks aside - would running a VM of Sierra on top of the host installation effectively double the amount of system resources being used or do VMs not work that way?\n\nA: Not at all a downside. The VM does add a slight performance penalty, but at idle, you don't do double work. Also, you can always quit apps on the host or the guest os to free up resources. For isolating changes and tests, VM are great.

All you are doing is booting from a slightly modified El Cap install.  There is no need to upgrade your EFI to the 2,1 roms unless you will be upgrading your CPUs.  There is no need to flash your video card's ROM to a mac version.  You will need a more recent video card--I use a 5770.  \nThe process is simple.  Install El Cap on an SSD/HD using another mac that does support El Cap, disable csr, and then change the boot.efi file to an alternate ( https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader ) optionally using a script to make things easier ( https://github.com/ryanmaclean/Mac-Pro-1-1-El-Capitan-Upgrades ).  \nIf your video card isn't a mac version, your screen will be blank (no boot logo) until your desktop comes up, but that's never been an issue.  You may need to fix the boot.efi file after an update, but I don't imagine that happens much any more.  \nOther than that, enjoy!  \nEDIT: \nBoth my ati 5770 and my nvidia 660ti work on my pro 1,1 with ElCap.  While it is true that older cards wont let you boot and only suffer a few seconds of blank screen, it is not due to a lack of EFI bios on the cards. There isn't an EFI bios available for any 5770 afaik, and Zotac was not kind enough to provide an EFI update for my particular 660ti.  I am sure of this due to working through these issues getting PCI passthrough to work with KVM/qemu with these cards on another box and having to substitute an EFI rom via a file.   But, yes, if you have a pc/win card older than 2012 or so, you might need to flash for mac or find a more recent card.  \n\nA: \"You can NOT brick your machine doing this.

I had already upgraded my video card to an ATI-5770 so all I really had to do was download a copy (torrent) of El Camino, partition a second drive and build the bootup drive. I had it running like a clock in less than an hour! Thanks so much for this trick!  \n\nA: What you want to do is not an easy task. I'm not saying it's impossible, but you do risk bricking your machine. I assume you have some software that requires Yosemite or El Capitan, so only you can decide whether the risk is worth it. \nThe trick is not as much about the hardware as it is about convincing your old Mac Pro to run in 64-bit mode. That's because your Mac can't natively boot OS X Yosemite or El Capitan without a different boot loader.\nI have seen a number of approaches used to get these machines to work with newer OS versions, so it's too hard to try and summarise these here. Below are some links for you to check out:\n\n\n*\n\n*2006/2007 Mac Pro (1,1/2,1) and OS X Yosemite\n\n*How To Resurrect A 2006 Mac Pro 1,1 So It Can Run OSX Yosemite\n\n*How to: Easiest Install of Yosemite on Unsupported Mac 2006/2007\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*The above solutions are not without risk - including the potential to brick your machine!\n\n*If you proceed, ensure you have a full backup of your data.\n\n*Personally, I would not bother - your machine originally launched with Mac OS X 10.4.7 and only officially supports up to Mac OS X 10.7.5 - so you can imagine how well the hardware will run Mac OS X 10.10.x or Mac OS X 10.11.x.\n\n", "Q: What does \"Reinstall macOS\" do, exactly? I was recently having some problems with iTunes, and decided to reinstall macOS Sierra. I held Command+R on startup and clicked on \"Reinstall macOS\" without erasing the hard drive in Disk Utility. Once the reinstall was complete, I started back up and all of my files and programs were still there, along with my settings, desktop wallpaper, and everything else. (The iTunes problems were fixed.)\nWhat exactly does this \"Reinstall\" feature do, if it doesn't remove programs and change settings to default?\n\nA: It does exactly what it says it does–reinstalls macOS itself. It only touches operating system files that are there in a default configuration, so any preference files, documents and applications that are either changed or not there in the default installer are simply left alone. No doubt it is a bit more complicated than that but all a re-install does is replace the old files with \"fresh\" versions. \nNo doubt there are preference files and other things that are deleted/modified but Apple seems to have gone to great lengths to ensure that reinstalling the operating system won't delete anything that you have subsequently installed/modified.\n\nA: This installs the system that came with your Mac when it was new. It isn't associated with your Apple ID, so the new owner can use the App Store to upgrade to a later version using their Apple ID.\nfor more info visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\n", "Q: How to install Java using terminal? I want to install Java entirely from the terminal without using any GUI. Can anybody give some instructions?

Recently, after opening safari on my macbook air, it began asking for the password to my local items keychain. Immediately this raises a red flag, as this never happened before and seems not entirely unlikely to be some form of malware.

I had been backing up to a 2 TB Time Capsule. When connecting to it the first time I selected \"inherit\" and thought things were working. Checked my backup tonight and it says it can't back up, not enough room. I thought Time Capsule tosses the oldest to make room for the new. Digging deeper it says my oldest backup is March 4 (says that's also my last backup). I open Time Capsule and lo and behold, years of backups are gone, March 4 is it. But it shows last update March 12 (but tonight I get alerts every few minutes saying the automatic backups aren't happening. My wife has had this problem for a couple of months. What are we doing wrong?\n\nA: Time Machine backups are per-machine. You can't merge the data from your old MacBook Air with the backup for the new MacBook Pro. (Whilst there are technically methods for doing this they are almost universally a bad idea and carry a significant risk of corrupting the old backup and creating a ton of bloat for any future restore. See: Is there a way to merge Time Machine backups?. \nIf you still have the .sparsebundle file for the old MacBook Air and the encryption password (if set). You should archive this (somewhere that isn't the time capsule) so that you can access this data if required. You should then have enough space to instruct your new MacBook Pro to backup to the Time Capsule.\nTo check the actual backup files you should open the Time Capsule directly in Finder. Based on what you've said thus far I'd expect to see the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air Sparsebundle\n\n*MacBook Pro Sparsebundle\n\n*Wife's Mac Sparsebundle\n\n\nYou'll want to copy the MacBook Air Sparsebundle somewhere safe - this is essentially your long-term backup containing all the backup history from your old MacBook Air.\n", "Q: Windows 10 stuck on boot mode on mac I try to install Windows 10 on my Mac.

It's a Hong-Kong phone, per the authorized agent in Manilla.\nHow can I get it serviced by Apple, as the authorized agent doesn't want to cover the work, given it's import status.\n\nA: It sounds to me like the store you bought it from, imported it as a grey import from Hong Kong. However, all iPhones come with a global warranty, so you will be covered. \nYou need to contact Apple directly - someone there will be able to organise something for you. You may need to provide proof of purchase, so have that ready (scan it in if you haven't got a digital copy).\nFor your info, below is a similar experience I'm aware of firsthand.\nI recently helped a lady who purchased a new iPhone from a local online store. About 10 months later the iPhone developed a fault, and while it was definitely under warranty, it took a while to establish this fact because the serial number came up as having been purchased in Thailand, and because it was dated about 7 weeks earlier than when she had purchased it. \nIn this case, she needed to show her purchase receipt to correct the commencement date for her warranty, as it was originally showing as only 8 days remaining compared to the two months she thought she had left. It did get all sorted, but the issue had to get escalated before it was resolved.\n\nA: I bought a grey-market iPhone 4S in Thailand that had come from Hong Kong originally. The following year I went to Indianapolis in the US, and on the four flights from Bangkok to Indianapolis, the screen had started to come apart in the top-left corner. Since there is an Apple Store in Indianapolis, I went there and asked if it was possible to get it repaired, and the woman at the store looked up the serial number and told me that it was 11 days inside its warranty. She said come back in the afternoon and she would have a new replacement for me. I told her I needed it to be factory unlocked since the one I bought was factory unlocked, and she said it was not a problem.\nI went back in the afternoon, and was given a brand new (seven weeks old! I looked up its serial number online) iPhone with the same spec as the one I had has for nearly a year. With a new battery and everything!\nI was extremely impressed with this level of service. We do not have anything like this in Thailand, as the nearest official Apple store is a two-hour flight away in either Hong Kong or more recently Singapore.\nIf you have a chance to take it to HK or SG (if you know someone going there, for example), I would strongly recommend going to an official Apple store, if you don't have one in the Philippines. The service is astonishingly good - and they don't care which market the phone was designed for, or where it was originally bought.\n", "Q: exiftool doesn't remove meta data of MP4 (stuff like \"Promotion URL\" and \"Author URL\") I have a MP4 file with ad URI in meta data.

I have a MacBook Pro and according to Apple, its cycle count limit is 1000. What happens when it surpasses 1000 cycles? Will the battery continue working or not? Will the MacBook still be able to receive power from the battery or not? Should it be replaced?\nThanks.\n\nA: As it says on the page you've linked to (emphasis mine):\n\nBatteries have a limited amount of charge cycles before they're considered to be consumed. Once consumed, a replacement battery is recommended. You can use your battery after it reaches its maximum cycle count, but you might notice a reduction in your battery life.\nKnowing how many charge cycles your battery has and how many are left can help you determine when a battery replacement is required. For best performance, replace your battery when you reach its maximum cycle count.\n\n\nA: I disagree. You should only replace the battery once it stops holding a charge or its capacity becomes noticeably bad, unless you're under warranty and can get it for free. \n", "Q: Unable to install Signal from App Store on iOS Each time I try to install Signal Application from App Store on iOS, I get the message:\n\nThis item is currently being modified.

You can keep trying for a few hours and see if this clears itself.\nIf after 24 hours you still see the same error, you can contact the developer's support (usually from their website) and let them know.  It's not uncommon for this happen when the developer hasn't made any changes at all; there's dozens of comments about this throughout the years in the Apple developer forum.\nThe developer is the one losing revenue so it would be in their best interest to contact Apple about the problem and work with them to resolve it.\n", "Q: Getting Yosemite instead of El Capitan I purchased a Macbook Air 10.11.2 El Capitan back in February 2016.

Then it's available to create a new text document at whatever location Finder is set to, that one has write permissions to. In other words, if one tries to create a new text document at a location that is only write accessible to e.g. root or any location one does not have specific write permissions to, then one is notified upon trying to create the new text document.\nThe code checks to see if a file of the same name already exists and if so notifies and brings back the Save As: dialog box.\nOpen (Apple)Script Editor and copy and paste the code below into the empty window and save it as Create New Text File Here.app. Make sure you select Application for File Format: in the Save As: dialog box.\nBefore adding it to the Toolbar of Finder, you'll want to change it's icon to that of which is used by TextEdit. You can open the Get Info sheet for each app and then copy and paste the one from TextEdit.app to the one in Create New Text File Here.app. Note that this is the icon displayed in the top left corner of the Get Info sheet.\nNow that it has a nicer icon, drag and drop the new app to the location on the Toolbar of Finder you'd like for it to be.

I'm trying to download a custom android recovery image on my Mac but the extension is changed from .img to .ndif automatically. Is this normal? Will it have any impact on the installation on actual image?\n\nA: From this site explaining what the ndif extension is:\n\nNDIF is an acronym for New Disk Image Format. The .ndif file extension is commonly used for files that contain disk images for computers that are running on the Mac operating system.\nAn NDIF file contains an image of a disk or a drive that was copied to the file from the user's hard drive. This information can then be used to restore data that has been lost or corrupted.\n\nI can't tell you if that specific file is 'normal' or is safe to open (you can use various unzipping/unraring applications to open it), that's up to you depending on where you got the file.\n", "Q: How to use picture-in-picture for amazon instant video?

I don't get it.\n\n*For that matter, how might some files even end-up with missing resource forks in the first place?\n\n\nthanks.\n\nA: Resource Forks are a part of Mac OS files that were mostly used on Mac OS \"Classic\" (Pre Mac OS X, E.G. Mac OS 6 - Mac OS 9) In earlier Mac OS, and on the HFS File System (and HFS+) files had two \"forks\", the \"data\" fork and the \"resource\" fork. The data fork is what all files today have; the resource fork was a proprietary data structure from Apple designed for storing images, icons, dialog boxes, code and more in a structured file format.\nThey're not \"metadata\", they contained actual program code. Here's a screenshot from the old ResEdit program which was how resource forks were edited\n \nUnix, Linux, and Windows lack a clear analogous data structure like the Mac Resource Fork. In part due to this compatibility issue, Resource Forks are not really used anymore (they're largely replaced with \"Bundles\")\nBecause of this, BSD/*nix tools like tar do not (by default) handle the resource fork. Therefore, when you run tar cf, you only archive the data fork \nNote that in some versions of OS X, the built-in /usr/bin/tar utility will preserve resource forks, bu I can't confirm this for all versions of Mac OS X. If you want to preserve resource forks, look into ditto or make an HFS+ disk image (dmg) file\nHelpful, but out-of-date information: http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/macosx.html\n", "Q: How do proceed if I get \"Verification failed\" errors from iCloud?

But all full resolution versions are stored in iCloud.\n", "Q: Sierra - 'There is a problem...' when connecting to Windows Vista PC I'm familiar with how this should work, but for some reason it's steadfastly refusing to cooperate on my system.\nI have an old Windows Vista system, which I just use for hosting an old Parallel Port thermal label printer, and I'm trying to connect to it from my macOS Sierra installation. It used to work - but recently broke.\nThe issue appears to be related to attempting to connect to a file share on the same machine via the Finder: I can see the machine in the Network browser, but when I attempt to connect to it, I get the message that:\n\n'There was a problem connecting to the server \"\". The server may not exist or it is unavailable at this time. Check the server name or IP address, check your network connection, and then try again.'\n\nWhat does work is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connecting to the file share using Command-K, and entering smb://.local;\n\n*Connecting to another SMB file share (a Synology NAS) on the network using the Network browser;\n\n*Other Macs on the same network.\n\n\nWhilst I can happily use Command-K to connect to the file share, when it comes to connecting to the Windows printer share, I have no choice but to use the Network browser. For the record, I'm attempting to connect to the printer share by:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Printers & Scanners;\n\n*Press the + button;\n\n*Select Windows;\n\n*Navigate into 'workgroup', then into  - this brings up the same error as before.\n\n\nI've already tried creating a new user account - same behaviour - and connecting using a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adaptor instead of Wifi - same behaviour.\nAny ideas?! Thanks.\n\nA: I am guessing here but it just MIGHT be something to do with the shared printer on your Vista machine. I would be sorely tempted to remove the printer, uninstall the driver, use the printer utility to REALLY remove the driver, reboot and re-add the printer and the printer share.\nWindows printer sharing can be flakey, ESPECIALLY if you are sharing it to a Mac. Not sure whether to blame it on the Mac or the PC, but I am leaning towards blaming the PC...\n\nA: Ahhh - isn't it the way.

I realized yesterday that I had no disk space left on my iPhone 5 after I got spammed with iOS notifications that my apps could not be updated (due to lack of disk space). This morning I woke up to about 350 MB of free space - and I didn't do anything.\nI don't know what the exact numbers were for usage (Settings --> General --> Storage & iCloud Usage --> Manage Storage), so I don't know what happened. As well as gaining free space, about 10 apps were updated.\nMy best guess is that there is some internal routine to compress images, since at full resolution they take up a fair amount of space, but even minimal lossy compression can save megabytes per photo without a noticeable loss in quality.\nIs there such a documented process, or did something else happen? In any case, I wish I would have screenshotted the storage usage before this happened...\n\nA: You can try to do the most obvious and smart things that free up space on your iPhone. Which are\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to iOS 10.3: Apple’s new file system, Apple File System (APFS) included in iOS 10.3 is optimized for flash and solid-state drive storage. According to [Apple Insider][1], there has been a gain of space of almost 8GB in a 256GB model. But don’t expect a gain of 6-8GB in your 16GB or 32GB. As Apple Insider explains, the more memory you have, the more free space iOS 10.3 will reclaim.\n\n*Backup Photos using Google Photos: Google Photos is basically a cloud storage for your photos. It works great with iOS too. Google Photos offers unlimited photos and videos for free, up to 16 megapixels and 1080p HD. Photos that are safely backed up can be removed from your device’s storage in just a tap.\n\n*Remove “Other” Data on your phone: When you connect your iPhone to a computer and open iTunes, you would encounter the “Other” section in little iTunes usage bar graph. Check out this tip by OSXdaily on how to manage this issue. http://osxdaily.com/2013/07/24/remove-other-data-storage-iphone-ipad/\n\n*Use Progressive Web Apps (PWA): Although PWA offers to free up app space, iOS doesn’t fully support it at this point. Some features\nsuch as Add to Home Screen and Push Notifications, are available in\nsome form in Safari but are not implemented in standard ways. To\ngive you a comparison of the Space utilization for an App VS PWA,\nthe Twitter app has a size of 196 MB in the app store. But the PWA\napp for twitter is just 1-2MB!\n\n*Stream your music instead of downloading them\n\n*Remove offline reading list data in Safari: This can be done by navigating to Settings and then General > Usage > Manage Storage > Safari. Then, go to Offline Reading List and tap Delete.\n\n*Clear the Safari browser cache: To clean up the cache, simply go to Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data.\n\n*Remove items from iBooks\n\n*Disable using My Photo Stream: Go to Settings > iCloud > Photos, then turn off My Photo Stream\n\n*Delete Burst Mode photos\n\n*Don’t keep both photos when you enable HDR mode. Go to Settings > Photos & Camera, then deselect Keep Normal Photo\nIf you have tried most of the above-mentioned tips and still find yourself with less storage space then follow this trick to gain more space.  This trick forces iOS to clear it OS cache. There has been an ongoing argument that since this is a system level cache it would have been freed anyway when you actually needed the space. But this does not seem to work if you are in the middle of taking a video and run our of space.\nhttp://techathlon.com/free-gbs-space-iphone-deleting-photos-apps-files/.\n\nA: What I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your iPhone into your computer and use iTunes to back it up locally.\n\n*Unplug your iPhone and go into Settings > General > reset > erase all content and settings, wipe the phone. it will take 5-10 minutes.\n\n*Once you have wiped your phone, plug it back in to your computer and use iTunes to restore from the backup you just made.\n\n\n(yes backing up and then restoring your iPhone frees up space)\nIt is likely that you will have regained at least a bit of free space, allowing you to do what you need to do to to delete apps, emails, photos, music, etc. and free up some space.\n\nA: You most likely have your iPhone set up to optimize photo and/or music storage.\nSettings > Photos & Camera see if Optimize iPhone Storage is selected. \n\nIf your iPhone is low on space, full-resolution photos and videos are automatically replaced with optimized versions. Full-resolution versions are stored in iCloud.\n\nSettings > Music > Downloads and see if Optimize Storage is on.\n\nIf your iPhone is low on space, automatically remove music from this iPhone that you haven't played in a while.\n\n\nA: Possibly one of your apps is refreshing in the background and loading content. For example I believe Snapchat is able to do this, imagine that your friends posted a bunch of content and then it expired over night. Some video services that allow offline downloads can also expire.\nThe content requires storage but storage will be reduced once it's gone.\nDiagnosis: Take screen shots of your storage usage by app with 24 hour gaps to see if some of them fluctuate and by how much.\n\nA: I will go with what chris said and i won't do what steve said if the phone is not giving you any problems i would suggest to go to apple store and download any app which will help to clean your cache and temporary files. I know you don't have free space to download it probebly but it us better to have it and use it time to time to get some free space. You shouldn't worry about getting free space automatically cause the phone won't delete anything that is important by it-self it only deletes or upload files to iCloud if you have enabled the photo stream or sharing cause after uploading to icloud it deletes the pics from your phone that maybe gave you some space. \n", "Q: When looking in \"All My Files\", I see multiple instances of the same file In finder (OS X 10.12), when browsing the \"All My Files\" section I see usually 3 instances of each file. Even after deleting the real file the duplicates exist, and Finder tells me they are all the same size.\nWhen I try to move these duplicates to my trash can, it turns into a eject symbol and I cannot delete them.\n\nA: Do you have an external (or network) Time Machine drive set up? If so it is possible that you are seeing the backed up copies of your files.\nOpen System Preferences and click on the Spotlight icon and then the Privacy tab. Click the \"+\" button at the bottom of that window and add the Time Machine drive(s). You can then quit out of System preferences.\nSomething similar was happening to me where I was getting seemingly duplicate items in searches. Excluding my Time Machine drive eliminated that issue.\nJust realize that now if you need a file from a Time Machine backup you cant just search for it, you'll have to enter Time Machine to find the file.\n\nA: This also happened to me. I found another discussion on an apple forum with helpful advice.\nHit cmd option and escape at the same time and it brings up a list of programmes to force quit. Select \"Finder\" and press \"Relaunch\" and that should work. It did for me.\n\nA: Relaunch Finder worked for me.\n", "Q: What audio quality is available on newer iPhones? I am wondering what maximum sample rate and bit depth is available through the USB connection to both the iPhone 6 and 7 (And any other models would be interesting).\nI am a registered iOS developer so links to Apple confidential stuff (Or however is works) is OK but still not preferred.\nKind of related is this other question I just asked.\n\nA: TL;DR: It appears the iPhone 6 supports 24-bit audio and 48 kHz playback. \nSo I found a way to empirically test playback.\nThis first screenshot shows a recording of playback over iPhone USB into Quicktime. You can see from the spectrogram that there is data in the 22-24k range, which means that playback is at least 48 kHz.\n\nThis next screenshot shows playback over USB straight into audacity. Basically, I played -95 dB and -97 dB tones at both 16- and 24-bit audio. -97dB is below the minimum volume of 16-bit audio. While all the other tones made a sound, the 16-bit, -97 dB chunk of the recording shows no sound, while 24-bit -97dB does play a sound.\n\n\nA: There appears to be no theoretical limit to the bit depth and sample rate an iPhone 7 can produce. The stock Apple apps and the built-in DAC used for the speakers and their headphones only support 16-bit at 48 kHz. That being said, devices plugged into USB/lightning port use their own DACs and iOS provides an interface in which an app (or your own code) can access the source file directly before conversion.\nI can't link you directly to Apple developer resources for specific methods/classes, as I no longer have a developer account but this article seems to have a lot of the basic info, even though it's presented as more of a rant than anything else: \nhttp://www.recode.net/2016/9/14/12904906/apple-iphone-7-audio-sound-quality-opportunity-airpods\n\nA: There appear to be vendors who sell USB audio ADCs and DACs that claim to be iOS compatible (via the Lightning Camera connection kit) and also claim sample rates of 96k and 192k.\n", "Q: Copy photos from places album to PC In the iPhone photos app, there are now special folders (Places, People, etc.). Unfortunately, photos in these albums will not import automatically into Windows when the iPhone is connected via USB. \nPhotos in the Places album do not show up in the \"All Photos\" album or the \"Camera Roll\". \nDoes anyone know of a procedure for getting photos from these albums (specifically, the Places album) onto a Windows PC? \n\nA: An alternate method for download is:\n\n*\n\n*Visit https://icloud.com\n\n*Log in using your Apple ID\n\n*Select the Photos app\n\n*Select the photos you wish to download\n\n*Click the Download icon at the top right of the window\n\n\nA: Your camera roll have all the photos no matter which album is it you maybe have to look up closely but all the pictures that you have in your phone no matter what album is it should be in your camera roll besides the one you deleted from any of the album or your camera roll, that should be in the deleted folder. \n", "Q: Is Late 2016 MacBook Pro 13\" Capable of 3440 x 1440 @ 100 Hz?

So that doesn't seem right either.\n\nA: ‘export’ doesn't write anything to file. It's for making variables available to subprocesses.\nIf you've never written anything to .bash_profile, it's unsurprising that it doesn't exist, since it's not created for you. You'll need to create it yourself and write that line within.\nFor example, touch ~/.bash_profile (to create the file) then edit it in an editor of your choice such as TextEdit (open using Finder or open -e ~/.bash_profile). Alternatively, nano ~/.bash_profile. Paste in export PROJDIR=/Users/$USER/Projects and save the file, then reopen your shell or source the profile.\n\nA: Redirection is one of the simplest ways to create a file with text or append a file with text. Standard output is redirected with the > symbol or appended to a file with >>.\nIn your case, you want the string export PROJDIR=/Users/$USER/Projects added to .bash_profile.

I am looking for a quick and handy solution, not the export function. That takes up ages to export the emails.\n\nA: Why not let the export take three days or whatever is needed? That's the safe bet if you can't afford to lose mails. Also, the longer it takes to export, the more likely you have database issues or a volume of mail that demands a redundant backup in an industry standard format. \nJust like exercise, there may not be a quick and handy remedy to months of inaction. If you have years of mail, it might also be necessary to test restoring your normal backup before trusting the export. No one actually wants a backup, they ultimately hope to know they have a good restore chance.  \n\nA: In mail.app, you can select a folder and from the main menu choose ‘Mailbox > Export Mailbox’, select a location for the export file and click ‘choose’.

I have a keyboard defined as a .klc file by Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator for the underrepresented language Fulfulde (fub) in Arabic-style script. I would like to use it on Mac. How can I convert it?\nI know about SIL's Ukelele keyboard layout for macOS, but I can't figure out how to import the .klc file. I don't even know how to interpret the contents of the .klc file so that I can manually enter them into Ukelele.\nHere's the .klc keyboard definition.\n\nA: I have never heard of any way to convert windows layouts like this to OS X. You probably have to create it from scratch or just modify an existing Arabic layout.  If you could find one already made for Hausa Ajami, it might be similar.\nYou could also ask on the Ukelele list:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ukelele-users\nConverters do exist to go the other way, from .keylayout to .klc\nOne (perhaps tedious) possibility would be to edit/redo the list contained in the .klc and try to use it in KeyLayoutMaker.  But I suspect drag/drop from Character Viewer into Ukelele's graphic interface, using Apple's Arabic Qwerty layout as a basis,  would be easier.\nIf you do create such a keyboard, I would be grateful for a copy.\n\nA: I haven't been able to find neither a macOS importer for .klc files nor a pre-made Fulfulde/Arabic keyboard layout file.\nYou have to do it manually either with a text editor or with an editor and Ukulele. \n\nThe content of the klc file means the following:\nTogether with the SHIFTSTATE def near the beginning of the klc file and the example key A the various key combinations are:\nVKEY  A (no mod)  shift-A  ctrl-A  altctrl-A  shift+altctrl-A\nA     0627        064e     -1      -1          -1\n                           ↑       ↑           ↑\n                           Press A with Ctrl, AltCtrl or Shift & AltCtrl do nothing (none)\n                  ↑\n                  Unicode U+064e (ARABIC FATHA)\n      ↑\n      Unicode U+0627 (ARABIC LETTER ALEF)\n\nPressing A will result in ا, shiftA prints something similar to ´ and ctrlA,altctrlA,shiftaltctrlA print nothing.\nUsing Ukelele's Arabic.keylayout file as base file - which has to be copied and modified - this translates to:\nThe <keyMapSelect mapIndex=\"6\"> is the one without modifier (see: <modifierMap... at the beginning of the file) and you would have to scroll down to it and change key code 0 (=a) from\n    ...\n    <keyMap index=\"6\">\n        <key code=\"0\" output=\"ش\"/>\n        ...\n\nto\n    <keyMap index=\"6\">\n        <key code=\"0\" output=\"ا\"/>\n        ...\n\nor for Shift-a (=<keyMapSelect mapIndex=\"7\">)\n    <keyMap index=\"7\">\n        <key code=\"0\" output=\"«\"/>\n        ...\n\nto\n    <keyMap index=\"7\">\n        <key code=\"0\" output=\"َ\"\n        ...\n\n(the \"ARABIC LETTER FATHA\" is hard to see in this last line because it's usually placed above a consonant - here it modifies the left double quote \"َ⟷\")\nModifier map def/meanings: Technical Note TN2056/modifierMap Element\nmacOS Keycode table: Where can I find a list of Mac virtual key codes?\nMac's don't normally use the control key as a modifier key for special characters.

But when they tried to apply for the Enterprise program, they get an error \"Cannot enroll in Apple Developer program\".\nI read from Apple's documentation that a D.U.N.S. number is required. But the problem is, I don't see any field where I should put my D.U.N.S. number. Apple just put a big sentence \"Cannot enroll in Apple Developer program\" without even providing any solution. I read this article that Apple is supposed to \"magically\" can pull the D.U.N.S. number from D&B for my client company. Is this the case? The main problem for me is that I don't see any field at all to put the D.U.N.S. number, so in this case I'm worried that I overlooked the important thing or settings to input this, so that the verification process can begin to enable the client's company to create Enterprise account.\nCan somebody help me? Thanks.\n\nA: Yes, you can't specify the DUNS number during enrollment. This is part of the 'due diligence' that Apple has to do themselves, in order to verify that you are really representing a company, instead of 'impersonating' one. They might also get in touch with the person you mentioned to have 'legal authority' for this company. \nBasically, with the Enterprise Development Program, you're setting up a legal contract between your company and Apple, and the rules for that are more strict than if you just sign up as an individual.\n\nA: My advice is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Print out and read carefully - https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/\n\n*Verify the duns number you wish to use with Dunn & Bradstreet. Print out everything - preferably to a PDF so you can copy and paste all details like address, country, exact punctuation for the company name. Joe Schmoe LLC isn't the same as Joe Schmoe, LLC. and will cause delay or a human to intervene. \n\n*Wait 14 days after any change to D.U.N.S. - they do not synchronize or push changes to Apple. Apple apparently doesn't run a lookup, but instead looks at their cached copy of the data. \n\n*Keep detailed notes on the AppleID used for institutional use like developer. \"Birthday\" and security questions are awkward for role based accounts, so be prepared to record them for the business in case you are asked to verify as part of enrollment. \n\n*On the 15th day, copy and paste the same company details as is in the duns database for your account there when you apply with Apple. Fix mistakes with DUNS before you apply with Apple if at all possible. \n\n\nLastly, until you are accepted into the developer program, your escalation to a human is through the store support team. Contact them or your enterprise contact. Most enterprises have a team they can call for advice, use those contacts when you get hung up. Realize that if you aren't an enterprise, trying to look like one may be a difficult or lengthy process. \n", "Q: El Capitan unable to boot I am using a Mac Book Pro with El Capitan installed.

Thanks\n\nA: Boot to recovery HD and just reinstall the OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\nThis is done by Holding the Command and r keys down while turning on the Mac. You will then be given the option for reinstalling Mac OS. This will not delete any of your files, merely replace just the damaged Mac OS files.\nAll permissions will be fixed on the system side - no apps get deleted, no user accounts or date is deleted.\nWorst case, you'll need to set up a new admin user on the machine once it's reinstalled (boot to single user move and delete /var/db/.AppleSetupDone) to finish changing permissions on your user folder.\nYou could also boot to internet recovery if normal recovery fails. \n", "Q: Does AirDrop resize pictures - AirDrop photo resolution Does AirDrop alter images in any way to reduce size for faster transfer or the \"Preparing\" is preparing the package for tranfer, involving no image resize/compression?\n\nA: When it was originally launched for iOS (iOS 7), AirDrop occasionally down-sampled photos and videos for no apparent reason. However, since a later release (possibly iOS 8), I have never seen AirDropped media in a size/quality other than the original.\nWhen sharing photos and videos, “Preparing” indicates that the Photos app is downloading the full-resolution version from iCloud Photo Library. You will see this step regardless of the channel through which you’re sharing (including email and iMessage).\nYou should be able to verify after the fact that your device now holds a larger-file version of your photo or video (eg. by opening Image Capture or checking your storage used). See this answer for further details.\nThere are notable exceptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Slo-mo videos are finalized and reencoded, which removes their ability to have their “slow” portion adjusted.\n\n*Edited photos and videos need to be reencoded (to include those edits), so the quality may be slightly different vs. what was originally shot. However the resolution will remain unchanged.\n\n*It is unclear what quality setting Photos for macOS uses when sharing via AirDrop. You can enforce a certain quality level by first exporting the photo to your desktop, and AirDropping that file, rather than AirDropping straight from Photos. You'll probably want to use High quality and Full Size for edited photos, and Unmodified Original for unedited photos. See this answer for more details.\n\n", "Q: What is the model number for product MP2F2LL/A I'd like to purchase a case at the same time as purchasing this iPad from Apple's website, but I can't seem to figure out what the actual model number is.

It is no longer available without being an employee of Apple or being a member of Apple's Authorised Service Provider Program.\nAs for why, Apple hasn't publicly given a reason, but I speculate that it is due to the ability to find serial numbers of devices which have not been registered with Find My iPhone.\n", "Q: Automatically update multiple file names? I work at a printing company and we are constantly copying/repeating previous job folders containing multiple files that begin with a job number. We go through the filenames manually and update the numbers by just copy/pasting. Just wondering if there is a solution of some kind available to automate this process?\nEXAMPLE\nWe use a simple file system e.g. a folder named \"41777 Co. Name – (Business Cards)\" which contains usually about 5 files with the same name, having just some simple variations, e.g. \"41777 Co. Name – (Business Cards) PROOF\" or \"41777 Co. Name – (Business Cards) PLATE\", etc. For a lot of jobs, we simply copy the folder and then manually update the number for the folder and files. \nSince we do this every day, many times, I was just wondering if there is any way to somehow only once enter the new number and have the files automatically update with that number.\n\nA: There are a number of ways you could do this. Below I explain two possibilities.\nDo this natively within the Finder\nYou don't specify what version of macOS you're running. But a feature that was first introduced in Mac OS X Yosemite will do exactly what you need. To use this feature you would use the following basic steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the folder named \"41777 Co. Name – (Business Cards)\" and rename it to \"52888 Co. Name – (Business Cards)\"\n\n*Open the \"52888 Co. Name – (Business Cards)\" folder\n\n*Select all five files within the folder\n\n*Right-click on the files\n\n*Select the Rename 5 items... option from the context menu that appears (obviously, the '5' will be whatever number of files you selected at Step 3)\n\n*Select the Replace Text option from the drop-down menu in the window that appears\n\n*In the Find field, enter 41777\n\n*In the Replace field enter 52888\n\n*Click on Rename\nNote: You may want to also check out the Add Text and Format options to explore the other possibilities.\nA Better Finder Rename\nIf you're looking for much more advanced options, or are still using an older version of macOS, then A Better Finder Rename is an option worthy of consideration.\nThis software provides a huge range of renaming options - too many to cover here - but it's been a well supported package for at least ten years now. You can also download a free trial (assuming you have Mac OS X Lion or above).\nOther native options\nMac OS also provides AppleScript, Automator and Terminal, all of which could be used to batch rename files in the manner you want. Since it's most likely that you'll be able to use the Finder option, and because using AppleScript, Automator and/or Terminal is a bit more involved, I won't go into any detail here.\nHowever, should you wish to have more info on these options instead, let me know and I'll update my answer.\n", "Q: How to create a universal (script) file for a Mac, based on several Terminal commands I have several Terminal commands I use for troubleshooting purposes, by typing them in one by one into the terminal window.\nThese commands require the user's password to be entered.\nI'm looking for a way to create a universal (script) file with these commands. I want to be able to run the file on a Mac just by double-clicking on it or dragging the file over the Terminal icon.\nI have never done anything like this before. Is there any way to create such a script? Please advise.\n\nA: Short answer\nA .command script should do the trick\n\nStep-by-step\n\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit and create a new file\n\n*Convert it to plain text by clicking Format > Make Plain Text\n\n*Add your commands, one per line.\nFor example, you could do:\n#! /bin/bash\ncd ~/Desktop\nmkdir myCoolFolder\ncd myCoolFolder\n\n*Run chmod u+x ~/Desktop/myCommandScript.command in your terminal, where ~/Desktop/myCommandScript.command is the path to your script. This will give the terminal permission to run the file.\n\n*You're done!  Double-click the file to run. Dragging over the terminal icon will also work. \n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you need to do something that requires root (admin) access, you can prefix your command with sudo. When the script runs, you'll have to enter your password (and be an administrator)\n\n*If the end user isn't an administrator, but you need to do something that required root access, you can use su someAdminName, which will perform the command as someAdminName (you'll need his password).\n\n\nYou can also see here on Stack Overflow for a bit more information.\n\nA: A script is just a series of commands, so you could put it into a bash script.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncommand 1\ncommand 2\ncommand 3\n\nNow, this all depends on the they types of command and whether or not they require user intervention.  \nHowever, if you are getting diagnostic info, for example, you can have a script that does \n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Get SMART status of main drive\ndiskutil info disk0 | grep -i smart\n\n# Get the model of the machine in question\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep -i Identifier\n\nThose are just to examples.  Keep in mind that any output generated, will get sent to the console (screen).  However, you can redirect the output to a file by appending >> /path/to/outputfile.txt at the end of each command so you have a file which you can parse once the file has finished running.\nYou can name the file diagnostics.sh and place it anywhere you like.  Just make sure you make it executable by issuing the command chmod +x diagnostics.sh and use ./diagnostics.sh to execute it or double click on it to run it if it's saved to your desktop.\n", "Q: Why is Apple telling me to change my password after receiving a password reset email? I received an email telling me that someone requested a password reset for my Apple ID.\n\nDear ___,\nYou recently made a request to reset your password or unlock your Apple ID. Please click the link below to continue.\nReset Password or Unlock Apple ID >\nIf you did not make this change or you believe an unauthorised person has accessed your account, go to iforgot.apple.com to reset your password without delay. Following this, sign into your Apple ID account page at https://appleid.apple.com/gb to review and update your security settings.\nSincerely,\nApple Support\n\nThe part highlighted in bold seems to be saying that I should reset my password. Why?\nHere is my general understanding of password reset procedures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Someone requests a password reset (any person can do this for any account)\n\n*An email containing next steps is sent to the account holder's email\n\n*The email from step 2 is required to actually perform the password reset\nTherefore, unless my email is compromised (which I have no reason to believe), there is no reason to think my Apple ID is at risk, based on the information provided so far. Right?\nI also asked @AppleSupport about it on Twitter:\n\nAnd so they said:\n\nIf you did not request this change, for security reasons, update your password.\n\nGiven that anyone on the internet can request a password reset for any account, and given that to do so is futile without access to the account holder's email, what security reasons could Apple possibly talking about?\nAn example of why I think this could be a silly suggestion, let us suppose somebody wanted to annoy somebody else: all he would need to do is send repeated password reset requests. Should the recipient then feel obligated to change his password each time, \"for security reasons\"?\nSo, why is Apple saying that I should change my password? And if the answer is \"security reasons\", what are some examples?\n\nA: I'm not sure this question is actually on-topic here because you're effectively asking why Apple does something? That said, I offer this answer in the event it is kept open, and because I have worked in the IT Security field.\nAt the outset, I'm assuming that the email you received was a genuine email from Apple and not a phishing attempt.\nThe reality is that if someone other than you has requested a password reset, then you should assume they are up to no good. And, if that is the case, how many of your other online services are they also trying to access/reset? \nUnfortunately, many online users use the same password for many accounts. And this vulnerability is the number one way that hackers (etc) breach accounts. For example, you would have heard of the iCloud leaks of celebrity photos (known as The Fappening) that occurred in August 2014. While at first it appeared that the fault was somehow related to Apple's iCloud services, after an investigation Apple stated:\n\nThe leaked images were the result of compromised accounts, using \"a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet\". None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud® or Find my iPhone.\n\nSource: Apple Media Advisory\nThis highlights why Apple would want you to change your password. Say you were being targeted by someone, by obtaining your password from one site they know there's a good chance you've used the same password on another. And if someone has deliberately tried to reset your Apple ID password, then from a risk management perspective you have to assume they've also tried accessing some of your other online services.\nSo, by Apple telling you reset your password on their service, they are trying to help you manage that risk.\nUnfortunately, it's often not just the same password people use on their accounts, but the same security questions, the same recovery emails, etc. So, resetting your password is an excellent precautionary measure to take.\nFinally, by Apple stating in their email to reset your password without delay, they are exercising their duty of care and this would be very important in the event of a breach and/or subsequent legal action.\n\nA: The thinking is that most likely this isn't a prank and that it means somebody is trying to gain access to your account. While I agree it's unlikely somebody will get into your account I can see why Apple recommends this for the masses. \nI would assume this happens mostly because of typos (especially if you have a common name) such as using @gmail instead of @hotmail etc. but you can't be too careful these days.\nThis could also be hackers trying to confirm active accounts.\nAssuming you have a strong password and 2 step verification on, you should be ok. It's advised to change your password periodically anyway, so if you haven't done that in the past few months I would.\nIt's a personal decision but for the masses (who mostly have weak passwords) I would recommend they change their password (just like Apple has).\n", "Q: iPhone is overriding my Account Email with a different address I'm looking into an issue on an iPhone which has me stumped.

I've also added a different Outlook account (myname2@hotmail.com) and this does not have the same problem either.\nIt appears to be something to do with adding an account called myname@hotmail.com but I'm absolutely stumped.\nHas anyone encountered this issue, or can someone suggest some more troubleshooting steps please?\n\nA: It appears this issue was being caused by having the Gmail account linked to the Outlook one on Outlook.com.\nIn the settings on Outlook.com, under Mail > Accounts > Connected Accounts, the Gmail account was set up as a Connected Account.\nRemoving this Connected Account from Outlook.com resolved the issue and prevented the display name/email address of the account from changing.\n", "Q: iPhone 7plus Pages application - table formulas Is it possible to add a column of numbers together to get a total in the footer on the iOS Pages app on your iPhone?\nI've tried to directly enter the formula: =sum(c).  However this doesn't seem to work.\n\nA: Although presently formulas are not available in iOS Pages (version 3.1), if you have a copy of Pages for Mac, the document can be formatted there, share with iOS (either with iCloud, email, AirDrop, etc.) then edit on iOS as illustrated below. The formulas entered using Pages on the Mac will be retained provided one does not overwrite them with other text.\nIn the example below, the number 317 is changed to 17 thus updating the sum in the footer.  \n\n\n\nA: The Pages app for iOS doesn't support formulas (yet) – that's why it doesn't work.\nI couldn't find a reference by Apple stating this explicitly, but it probably suffices to compare the 'SEE ALSO' sections of the cell formatting options for Pages for Mac and iOS. They are identical, except for the Mac link to the Calculate values using data in table cells page, which is exactly what you want. This page simply doesn't exist for the iOS version of Pages.\n", "Q: Safe to delete \"Recovered Messages\" Mailbox in Apple Mail on Mac?

Is there anyway to export these positions so I do not have to do it manually? Thank you.\n\nA: I struggled a lot with building my DMG just the way I want it, then I've found dmgbuild. It basically lets you configure every possible setting with ease.\n\ndmgbuild is a command line tool to create Mac OS X disk images (aka .dmg files). While it is possible to create disk images easily enough from the command line using the hdiutil program that ships with Mac OS X, there is no easy way to configure the appearance of the resulting disk image when the user opens it. Some people have used AppleScript to automate Finder to adjust the appearance, but since Finder saves its .DS_Store files asynchronously, it is hard to guarantee that the changes will actually be saved when you want them to be. It also means that you need a GUI session, with Finder running, in order to build your disk image.\ndmgbuild does not rely on Finder; nor does it rely on deprecated APIs (like the Alias Manager functions). Instead, it uses the ds_store and mac_alias Python modules, which know how to construct the relevant data in Python code.\n\n", "Q: How do I preserve file paths after cloning a failing external drive?

If so, this probably won't work for you...  However, if you're just using standard MIDI ports, you might be able to use this, although no guarantees, as I haven't tested it.

I am trying to export with filenames being the Date + extra info so they will sort by time not original filename from phone or scanner etc, which is why it's taking so long to double check!\n\nA: Here's more information on vintage and obsolete products that may be of interest to you.\nYour questions actually covers two main concerns. I'll try and address these below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Web browsing: Many users of older Mac hardware and/or versions of the OS do tend to install additional browsers in order to be able browse more modern websites. Firefox in particular is useful for this, but others use Google Chrome. Either way, this addresses the websites acting funny issue in most cases.\n\n*Photos: In terms of iPhoto, this was superseded by the Photos app which was released with the OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 update in April 2015. In most cases users have just converted their iPhoto Library to become the Photos Library. In some cases, users still maintain both (although there is no need to do this - not only is it doubling up on valuable storage space, it's also a pain to do). Regardless, my point is that your iPhoto Library will not be lost because (1) it can be converted to the Photos Library in future and (2) you have Time Machine backups of your data. So, unless you have manually set your Time Machine backups to not backup your iPhoto Library, there's really no need to manually export all your photos from iPhoto.\n\n\nYour MacBook Pro\nAs an aside, I wanted to add that all 2007-2008 era MacBook Pros are capable of running Mac OS X versions up to El Capitan 10.11.6. If your MacBook Pro is indeed one of these you may want to consider whether you'd like to upgrade your OS so you can have the benefit of a more modern browser and software such as Photos. In this way, when you do eventually upgrade your hardware, the risk of any software incompatibilities will be reduced.\nOf course, before upgrading your OS you would need to confirm your model of MacBook Pro and its hardware configuration. You can do this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*going to Apple > About This Mac to view your processor and memory details, and\n\n*to get the exact model, click on the  More Info...  button and look for the Model Identifier (it'll be something like MacBookPro5,1).\n\n", "Q: Not booting after replacing the SuperDrive with SSD I am having trouble after replacing my iMac's SuperDrive with a Solid State Drive (SSD).\nI kept the original Hard Disk Drive (HDD) in place. I configured the SDD as the main startup disk and I transferred all the libraries in HDD.\nThe malfunction is that in the process of rebooting the iMac turns off.\nBooting into safe mode the Disk Utility shows the new SSD drive is full, although before rebooting it has used only 90GB out of 480GB. I do the same procedure again, clean install of macOS 10.12, and again the same problem. Any ideas please for solution of this malfunction?\nI have to say that if I do not reboot the iMac, it runs excellently, and the SSD drive has the same empty capacity 90GB used out of 480GB.\niMac 21\" 2009/late. SSD Kingston 480Gb / macOS 10.12, Sierra.\n\nA: \nI configured the SDD as the main startup disk and I transferred all\n  the libraries in HDD.\n\nHow exactly did you transfer the libraries?!\nNote, that Disk Utility.app (if used) does not create a bootable HDD backup!\nThere are different ways to clone/transfer the entire content of your previous installed main HDD. The following applications will allow exact and bootable drives/disk images.\n\nOption 01: Carbon Cloner creates a bootable drive/volume\n\n\nOption 02: CloneX4 allows you to make a bootable copy of your startup disk, as well as if you want to change your hard disk. Clone X will create a perfect bootable copy of your startup disk, or of any of your other disks. Clone X automatically handles all settings needed to make a correct bootable copy.\n\n\nA: The problem here is that you can't just \"transfer libraries;\"  you have to do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone your drive (not recommended in this scenario as it's not a disaster recovery situation)\n\n*Install macOS and migrate your apps and data.\n\n\nI much prefer the latter.\nTo do this, you are going to need a USB installer  or you could\n   do macOS Recovery by pressing CommandR (or\n   CommandOptionR for Internet\n   Recovery)\nUsing Disk Utility, make sure you wipe the drive and ensure there's\n   only one partition so you can use the whole 480GB, then proceed to\n   install on the SSD.\nOnce compete, use Migration Assistant to move your data from your old HDD to your new SSD.    Just select the option that allows you to restore from another disk\n\nFinally, since you are moving from an iMac that had a HDD to one that now has an SSD, make sure you enable TRIM support with the command sudo trimforce enable\n", "Q: RDP / Share screen bigger than actual size? I am able to share my screen on my macbook pro from my iMac, however, I can only access the screen at the same size as it is on the laptop.\nIs there a way (like RDP on Windows) to be able to remotely connect to the machine, but not be limited by the laptop resolution ? \n\nA: In short, you can't. \nThere is a fundamental difference between VNC and RDP.  VNC is a remote frame buffer whereas RDP is more semantic in nature and fully aware of the underlying desktop.1\nRDP actaully creates a desktop on the client machine and interprets handles fonts, pixels and resolution.  VNC just gets the pixel data.  This is also why VNC is horrible over anything but LAN connections whereas RDP is very efficient over even 56K dial up.  Repainting a bunch of pixels to move a window is vastly more inefficient that sending a command that says \"draw window of size (HxW) at coordinates (X,Y)\"\n\nThe VNC protocol is pixel based. Although this leads to great\n  flexibility (i.e. any type of desktop can be displayed), it is often\n  less efficient than solutions that have a better understanding of the\n  underlying graphic layout like X11 or desktop such as RDP. Those\n  protocols send graphic primitives or high level commands in a simpler\n  form (e.g. open window), whereas RFB just sends the raw pixel data,\n  albeit compressed.\n\nSo, while your iMac is capable of much higher resolutions, the RFB protocol will only send pixels that are being displayed and your MBP or VNC can't create pixels where none exist.\n\n1 RFB protocol. - RFB (“remote framebuffer”) is an open simple protocol for remote access to graphical user interfaces. Because it works at the framebuffer level it is applicable to all windowing systems and applications, including Microsoft Windows, macOS and the X Window System. RFB is the protocol used in Virtual Network Computing (VNC) and its derivatives.\n", "Q: How can I use Activity Monitor or \"netstat -n\" of terminal to check if my Mac OS X is being remotely viewed About 3 months ago, my windows often suddenly closed and the cursor would move. So I deleted all the team viewer apps and closed all the Share options in System Preference. I checked within Activity Monitor and also used netstat -n in terminal, but I don't know how to use/understand it.\nHow can I know if my Mac was being remotely viewed?\n\nA: I would actually use the \"last\" command.\n\n$ last > ~/Desktop/last_users.txt\n\nwill output the results to a document on the desktop you can open up and have a look at. Really, you should see your own user, reboot (a pseudo-user that gets activated when rebooting the computer), and just about nothing else.  I. personally have a \"_mbsetupuser\" that has to do with updating my OS, so you may have that as well.\nIf you see any usernames you don't recognize, that's a red flag.  If you see your own user on a tty other than \"console\" that might be an issue.  I'm not really great with netstat nor lsof, but here's an lsof primer.  The reason to learn lsof (whether in conjunction with netstat or not) is that linux treats most things as files.  lsof (short for \"list open files\") is a utility that helps you find out which files are open.  If someone's watching your system, they're opening \"files\" to do it, and that utility will show you that, unless there's a rootkit in place and/or the lsof utility itself has been hacked/modified to not show their presence, which is unlikely.\nSee a primer I quite like here: https://danielmiessler.com/study/lsof/\n", "Q: What is the normal fan speed on Mac computers I have noticed that fan speed on my Mac is 499 rpm. Now this is a computer with installed OSX El Capitan, Xcode 8.2.1... I have noticed this when Xcode got crashed few weeks ago (the information was provided in Xcode crash log). Now, today, when it crashed again, I have noticed the same fan speed, which is 499...That is a bit odd I must say, because rpm are very low, and I got same number twice.\nI wonder is this accurate info actually and what is the normal fan speed for MacPro3,1?\n\nA: There is no \"normal\" speed for a fan in a computer.  The fan spins at a speed necessary to keep the CPU temp in the \"normal operating range.\"1\nFor your particular Mac, the  maximum operating temperature is about 82°C (180°F).  However, keep in mind that this does not factor in other components like heat from drives, adapters, etc. which may also go into calculating when a fan is engaged.\n\n1 See section 5 in Intel® Xeon® Processor E5-2400 Product Family Thermal/Mechanical Design Guide May 2012\n", "Q: Using on screen keyboard and barcode scanner with iPad. So I am working on setting up an iPad for use as a POS system. I have a bluetooth bar-code scanner that I will be using, but I also want to use the on screen keyboard for entering information. \nBecause the scanner acts as a keyboard, it automatically hides the on screen keyboard. I can hold the up arrow on the input bar to bring the keyboard up, but I was hoping that there was a way to keep its original functionality (coming up when I tap on an input section) and use the barcode scanner at the same time. \n\nA: It depends on the bar code manufacturer and which Bluetooth profile they use.\nMost will use the HID (Human Interface Device) which will make it emulate a keyboard.  Some will have a button that triggers the on-screen keyboard to come up while others will use a different bluetooth profile (like SPP - serial port profile) that will allow data to come in via a different avenue.\nThe Socket Mobile Bluetooth scanner supports the extended Bluetooth profiles like SPP and MFi-SPP (Application Mode).  From their datasheet:\n\nApplication Mode - Improves business productivity with faster,\n  efficient and reliable data transfer over Bluetooth; leverages\n  Application Mode functionality by integrating Socket Mobile’s SDK in\n  app\n\nBasically, that a fancy way of saying the BT scanner communicates directly with the App and not as an HID device meaning the on screen keyboard (or another BT keyboard) is free to be used.\n\n\nA: Your barcode scanner doesn't support the functionality to switch the on-screen keyboard and barcode scanner on iOS. You can try Arkscan's bluetooth barcode scanners. They support the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toggle between the on-screen keyboard and barcode scanning by pressing a functional key button on the scanner or double pressing the scan button for some of their model.\n\n*For newer version of iOS, it allows you to toggle between on-screen keyboard, and on-screen keyboard plus barcode scanning at the same time, which I really like this feature.\n", "Q: iCloud is not accepting my Apple ID I use my work email address as my Apple ID, and have it set up more than a year ago.  I have had this same email address for almost 15 years and it is still functioning.  Today when I went to sign into iCloud it says incorrect ID or password.  I first tried to reset my password, but it tells me the email address is not a valid Apple ID.  I thought that was odd, and tried to set up the email address again as an Apple ID, but now it tells me that is not available.\n\nA: There are several reasons why you can't setup a new AppleID with a previously used email such as it's used as an emergency contact / backup account for another AppleID and verified or it's already the primary account.\nNo matter what the case, your best bet is to follow precisely the steps at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://iforgot.apple.com/password/verify/appleid\nThere is a link below if you can't unlock the AppleID you think you had titled \"Forgot AppleID\" at the end of that online tool, there will be a link to contact Apple Support - they are truly the ones best suited to help you with your specific details.

I want to be a able to download the amino app to my macbook but it has not been made to be able to do that but I would like to know if I could in some way\n\nA: I think this has been answered before in this thread.\nThe general reason is that the code is compiled for an ARM CPU (iPhone, Samsung, Pixel, etc).  Your MacBook has an Intel CPU and the code instructions are different.  As a developer, there is a simulator in Xcode to develop a mobile application with, but the simulator is not really for use to obtain an application from the App store and run it.   \n\nA: You can download the app easily using iTunes.

can be since both the configuration and the debug logs look good to me.\n\nA: Is it possible this answer resolves your issue? Replicated here in the interest of completeness:\nTry sudo chmod 666 /dev/tty to give proper permissions to /dev/tty - which may have inadvertently been changed. If you want to beforehand you can ls -la /dev/tty to check the current permissions and see if they're already rw-rw-rw.\n\nA: Since Sierra has removed permissions repair I could only try disk repair which while successful, did not fix the problem. Though less satisfying than finding the cause would have been, rebooting into recovery mode and reinstalling Sierra did remove the problem. \n", "Q: iTunes 12: Is there a way to increase album art size in the Album View I remember in earlier versions of iTunes it was possible to increase the size of album artwork in the Album View via a slider - so, for example, I could have fewer albums with large cover art per row or more albums per row, but with tiny cover art.\nHowever, I can't find this function anymore in iTunes 12. Does anyone know how to do this? :)\n\nA: I have the same question but no solution.\nSomeone somewhere advised an app: Swinian. It has the slider for changing the artwork. Very nice app. one month free trial.\nOther (obvious)workaround is changing the screen resolution. I use an app Switchres.Easy and fast but ofcourse it changes the resolution everywhere and not just iTunes album view.\nIt works but not ideal or perfect.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) Freezes/Lags when connected to TV via HDMI I've been trying to connect my TV to my Macbook via HDMI cable so I can use it as a second monitor. Every time I connected it, when I check 'Activity Monitor' a task called 'kernel_task' shoots up to like 500% CPU, the fan starts spinning really fast and the whole laptop lags/freezes. The bottom of the laptop feels like it could melt glass.\nI've tried a few things like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Different HDMI Cable\n\n*Unchecking 'Automatic Graphics Switching'\n\n*Resetting the NVRAM\n\n\nNone of these things have made a difference.\nDetails of my laptop are as follows:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012)\nProcessor: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7\nMemory: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB\nIntel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB\nOS: Sierra 10.12.3\nI have a much less powerful Windows laptop and it can be connected to the TV without any problems. I have also tried connecting when running Linux Distros and never experienced any issues. It appears to only be on this Macbook. \nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: One thing you haven't tried is resetting the System Management Controller (SMC). This is something I would definitely do, especially because of the fan speeds and high heat. However, even though you've already reset the NVRAM, I would do that first again and then reset the SMC. Below are the steps I recommend for doing both resets on your model of MBP.\nReset the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs (such as yours)  use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). I would reset this again before resetting the SMC. Here’s how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Ensure you have nothing connected to your MBP (TV, external Keyboard, etc) - however you can keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC test to see if your MBP functions normally/better and let me know how you go.\nOther factors to consider\nOfficially, your MBP is capable of an external resolution up to 2560 x 1600 pixels. So you will need to ensure that you're using the right settings to accommodate that. \n\nA: I discovered the problem... turns out that the Macbook couldn't handle the TV running such a high resolution (1080p). I dropped the TV resolution down to 1080i when plugged in to the Macbook and it's all working now. Thanks all for your help, and suggestions.\n\nA: I am having a similar issue while connecting my rMBP15 mid-2012 (same machine...) to an ACER beamer via HDMI. \nThe fix I found is to deactivate Automatic Graphics Switching in the Energy Saver preference panel, before connecting the HDMI cable. [I actually use gfxCardStatus to monitor which GPU is in use, with more options than the preference panel.]\n", "Q: Python 3 ImportError: cannot import name 'Config' when importing boto3 after installing with pip3 Currently trying to configure Python3 correctly with boto3 to utilize the AWS Dynamo Python SDK.

For each device Apple determines which resources will be actually used. They prepare package for the given device (for example only images with correct scale for given device will be included in package). Also, if bitcode option is enabled, they are able to re-compile your app in order to provide optimized binary for each device. All of the above might change the size of your application.\n\nA universal .ipa is a compressed app bundle that contains all of the resources to run the app on any device. Bitcode has been recompiled, and additional resources needed by the App Store, such as .dSYM files and On Demand Resources, are removed. For App Store apps, this .ipa is downloaded to devices running iOS 8 or earlier.\nA thinned .ipa is a compressed app bundle that contains only the resources needed to run the app on a specific device.

It's the window that has focus that accepts input.  Think about it...you can move your mouse anywhere across any open windows, but you have to take focus of the window (click or hover depending on your settings) before you can interact with it.\nEven moving the mouse in two separate windows is impossible.  Your mouse works on a coordinate system (X,Y).  You can see what it's (X,Y) value is by pressing CmdShift4 (screen capture).  There is no way to have a secondary coordinate value to \"mirror\" it on another window.\nAdding another display won't help, either because unless you are mirroring the display (and since your example used different chrome browser profiles) you would be extending the display and the available (X,Y) coordinate system.\n\nA: This may not be answering your exact question, but it might solve what you are trying to do.  You could use Automator to record what you do and then run it again, when you are logged in as another user on Google.  Just don't record the login part.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have an external developer in Xcode just using exported cert+prov Is it possible to have an external developer in Xcode without being logged in with an account, but using a exported certificate and provisioning profile?\nIs it possible to select an imported certificate and provisioning profile without signing in with the account in Xcode?\nWe do not want him to have access to our Apple developer account, but need him to use a specific provisioning profile, to be able to send out test versions.\nHow do you solve this?\n\nA: If you don't want him to have limited, handing your cert is not the way to go.\nAdd him as a team member on iTunes Connect, adjust his permissions and remove him when the QA ends. \nTo add a second user to your account:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/users_roles\nAdd the Apple ID for the person you want to be able to sign and don't let them upload.  This works for individual accounts as well as enterprise / corporate accounts. \n\nA: Thanks for the input but we do just not want him as a part of the team account because the app, though it is published on the team account, the app is moving out of the company.\nAnd it is not possible to move the app to an other account because it once used iCloud.\nWe ended creating a new developer account just to send test versions out.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro detects syncmaster (monitor) but doesn't display My new MacBook Pro 13\" touch bar is connected to my Samsung Syncmaster monitor through USB-c hub -> HDMI -> DVI. It detects the screen (shows up on OSX) but nothing is displayed on my screen. I have connected the MacBook on my LG TV through USB-c hub -> HDMI and everything works.\n\nA: It's most likely because you are doing two conversions of the video signal and at some point it's either being  degraded and/or becoming out of sync.\nThe two conversions I am referring to is going from DisplayPort to HDMI then going from HDMI to DVI.  In your original question, you never mention specifically what adapters you are using nor if they are active or passive.\nWhy an \"active\" adapter? Active adapters \"recreates\" the signal and passive just reorders the signals.\nTo solve this issue, you need to limit your adapter to just one conversion (no conversions at all is ideal - mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort) and do so with an active DisplayPort to DVI adapter.  \n", "Q: booting up my Macbook using option key and power on results in white screen with mouse I have a Macbook Pro.\nI installed Ubuntu and wiped all the partitions in the process (fit of rage and getting angry at OS X)\nsomeone told me to \"clear PVRAM by holding Option+command+R+P\"\nI did, this, now not even my ubuntu loads up.\nwhen I turn on the computer i get a white screen with a flashing folder with a question mark in the middle.\nwhen I boot by holding the option key, all I get is a white screen with a mouse pointer which i can move around.\nI have created a bootable USB drive using instructions from the below, although unable to boot from USB.\nhttp://pureinfotech.com/make-bootable-usb-mac-os-x-windows/\nHow do I go back to OS X (or even Ubuntu, so I can at least have a usable machine)\nThis question is close to my situation, but I exhausted the things that fix that issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*My MacBook Pro has a flashing question mark in a folder against a grey background\nSpecifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*My bootable USB doesn't work (so I need Mac OS to make a new one\n\n*I cannot get to the recovery tool or the Disk Utility.

Can I do a Time Machine backup without any damage in the future? Thank you for any help.\n\nA: No, you should never experience problems with this. There will never be any damage from this kind of transfer or by doing a time machine backup after the transfer.\nThat said, depending on which apps you use, some apps and app licenses may have been tied to hardware information such as the old computer's serial number. I'd recommend using migration assistant from a time machine backup of the 2012 computer to make sure you don't have a problem with these licenses.\n", "Q: How do I scale down a video without cropping?

A known way to turn off in iPhone if the screen isn't detecting touch is to let go of the home and power buttons as soon as the screen goes black.\nBut this sometimes doesn't work, and instead the iPhone restarts.  I wonder why.\n\nA: Well, the iPhone restarts because pressing the Home and Power buttons simultaneously for a longer period is actually the way to force a restart (on the iPhone 6S and earlier). I think you're simply holding them too long.\n\nA: I found two ways to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force restart and press home to put the iPhone in recovery mode (it will show a cable icon of sorts).\nOnce in recovery mode, unplug the iPhone.

Spoofing a MAC or IP is easy:\n\nFor Apple OSX the OS Fingerprint will be the MD5 hash of the\n  filesystem UUID for the root file system (i.e. ‘/’). For example a Mac\n  with a root UUID of “de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2- eb6b9e546013” would have\n  an OS fingerprint of “c001163fbbaaadabeb733e1e9ceb95e6”.\n\n(found in: (S//OC/NF) Network Operations Division\nCNE Operational Data Exchange Format\n(Codex) Specification, page 9)\nIf there are no logs or disable, how would you detect if the fingerprint file has been corrupted? altered?\nWould spoofing the fingerprint.codex.xml force the malware to be non-functional at boot?\nIs it possible to generate a secure hash with sha512k instead of md5 for the fingerprint?\n\nA: The linked document specifies a data exchange format based on XML. It describes how to package all data (including the fingerprint.codex.xml) in 3. (U) Directory Structure.\nThe whole CODEX data including single xml files (e.g fingerprint.codex) or metadata of the retrieved data (like emails or screenshots) mustn't be generated on the target host:\n\nGeneration of these metadata files and\n  formats MUST NOT take place on the target. Instead, tools MUST ship back to the user the necessary\n  details such that a Codex file or structure can be produced from the tool-specific custom format on usercontrolled,\n  potentially not internet connected, hardware. To repeat, tools MUST not store data on\n  target in Codex format or generate any custom Codex format on target.\n\nTarget here means: a monitored/attacked host. User here probably means: a data evaluator/processor of the agency or one of its contractors.\nAs a consequence the fingerprint.codex.xml doesn't even exist on the target's host but is generated somewhere else based on the conveyed data.\nAccording to the document (4.4 (U//FOUO) Fingerprint XML Format) a macOS fingerprint simply consists of the md5'd lowercase UUID of the root system. All other keys except usertag are related to Windows or Linux operating systems.\nThe UUID can be retrieved by entering:\ndiskutil info / | grep \"Volume UUID\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | awk '{print $3}'\n\nand its md5 hash with:\nmd5 -s $(diskutil info / | grep \"Volume UUID\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | awk '{print $3}')\n\nThe whole fingerprint file would look like this for a Mac (here an example macOS VM):\n<codex version=”1”>\n    <fingerprint target=”machine” type=”os” version=”1”>\n       <uid>“db78ec1b99a4e71fabbc0e23888baf64</uid>\n       <rootfsid>d15d6f4e-d213-373d-893e-f975126cb767</rootfsid>\n       <usertag>NONE</usertag>\n    </fingerprint>\n    <fingerprint target=”machine” type=”hardware” version=”1”>\n    </fingerprint>\n    <timestamp>2017-03-24 07:11:00.000000Z</timestamp>\n</codex>\n\nUnder the given circumstances the fingerprint file can't get \"corrupted\" or \"spoofed\" on your host - it's simply generated and stored somewhere else.\nYou can of course invalidate the current fingerprint related to your Mac by erasing your boot volume and installing a new system - this will generate a new Volume UUID (or rootfsid).\nI don't know whether the agency has a tool or a method to link a new fingerprint (and related CODEX data) created after a \"friendly second visit\"/surveillance/attack to the old fingerprint (and related CODEX data) of your now overwritten root volume. It probably has!\n\nAnd to answer your questions somehow:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can't detect if the fingerprint file is corrupted because you probably have no access to CIA data storage facilities\n\n*You can't spoof  the fingerprint file because you probably have no access to CIA data storage facilities and how should malware get non-functional at boot by a remote fingerprint file?\n\n*You can use any more or less \"secure\" hash algorithm to compute the uid in the fingerprint file.

If I purchased that monitor, could I be guaranteed that the screen would look the same across the monitor?\nHere's a picture of my problem:\n\n\nA: Both the LG 4K and 5K look great next to 2015 / 2016 MacBook and MacBook Pro at the angle you have photographed. You could try to set a custom color calibration curve for both displays to bring them closer, but the color shift you have photographed is very large. \nAlso, be sure to set the contrast and brightness levels on the external display before you attempt software calibration. Lastly, let the display run for 30 minutes before attempting color calibration. \n", "Q: How can I open application's windows on dock separately like Windows 7? I'm new to OS X.\nIf I open multiple Excel workbooks, how can I see each workbook opened separately on the dock?\nAny help?\n\nA: Pretty sure this isn't possible as I don't see a way in settings, here are some workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Minimized windows will show up in dock if \"minimize windows into application icon\" isn't checked in dock preferences (right click on dock to pull them up).\n\n*If all windows are not minimized you can swipe up with three fingers to show all windows. You can also cycle through windows by pressing command + `\n\n*Right click the excel icon in dock to display all open workbooks.\n\n\nA: Native methods closest to what you want are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right clicking Dock icon, as mentioned by @JBallin\n\n\n*\n\n*That will show a context list, which will include the titles of the open windows for that application\n\n\n*There's also the mission control feature that will show all open windows for the currently active application. You can find the shortcut in: System Preferences > Mission Control and there Application windows. I'm fairly sure you can set touch gestures for this as well. You should find that in System Preferences > Trackpad\n\n\nIf the native methods don't work for you, there's always the option to use third party applications.\nThere's a 3rd party Dock replacement called uBar ($20). There's a trial available.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can stop some applications from showing up in the dock, which is not very doable off the box with the native Dock.\n\n*Has window previews and option to group application windows (kinda like in Windows).\n\n*Ordering options: Manual, Alphabetical, Launch I love the manual order. I can make sure that when I open adobe applications, for example, they always open next to each other at the top of my uBar.\n\n*You'll likely want to hide native Dock. You can find terminal commands for that in here. It just hides it so that you are never likely to accidentally show it. You need the second to last terminal command. You can still easily toggle the native Dock open via the shortcut Cmd+Alt+D. The reason why I occasionally have the need to show the native dock is to assign which space I want an application to go to, which you do by right-clicking an icon in the dock and choosing: Options > Assing To:(at the bottom of the list). This is not a feature in uBar, so...\n\n\n\nNote that uBar has quite a few customization options, but I'd say it has two distinct styles. First style is very Windows Taskbar like, as shown in that picture above. The second style is closer to the modern Dock look:  \n\n\n\nAnother alternative or addition could be HyperSwitch (free beta). I use both of these 3rd party applications.\n\n\n*\n\n*It has option to show previews of windows when using cmd+tab\n\n\n*\n\n*It works by either cmd+tab:ing or hovering over the icon with a mouse. You can choose which window to open by navigating with arrow keys or of course clicking with mouse.\n\n*\n\n\n*It also has it's own alternative application switcher which can show each application window, instead the application icon, which is more like the windows application switcher. It can also be made to show only application windows in the current space, which is super useful for people who use spaces a lot.\n\n", "Q: No notification of receiving call whilst on a call While on a call, any other calls do not come in.

I use multiple displays, and often find the mouse pointer moving to the other display when going to the scroll bar or pressing the close button on an application, for example.\nIs it possible to make the mouse \"stick\" to one display? To see what I mean, you could try to slowly drag a window to a side of your display. It will stop when the edge of the window touches the edge of the display for a little while, unless you push it further. I essentially want this behavior for my mouse pointer.\nI found something similar to this for Windows, but unfortunately that's for Windows, not macOS where I need it!\n\nA: Try EdgeCase for US$14.99 from the MAS.  It has 4.5/5.0 stars with 53 reviews.  It should 'lock' your mouse to 1 display.  It might not be an exact duplicate of the one you found for Windows, though.\nThe application description states:\n\nThe app prevents you from ever accidentally losing your cursor into a rarely-used secondary display, or from overshooting as you flick to an OS X hotcorner or the menu bar.  EdgeCase prevents your mouse from moving between multiple monitors by putting a temporary barrier between the edges of your screens.\nWhen you do want to switch to another screen, EdgeCase provides several shortcuts that allow you to cross screen edges manually. Simply perform a 'bounce' gesture, wait for ½ second, or hold a hotkey. Your cursor will then move into the next screen freely.\n\n", "Q: Can I use HP:s HTML config on macOs Sierra somehow?

I can make calls using it whenever I want, but, if somebody calls me on the VoIP-number, when my phone's screen is dark, they just get a message stating: \"The subscriber is not available\".\nAccording to my VoIP-provider, this is a known problem -- I wonder, if there is a SIP-client, that solved it...

I have a mid-2011 MAcBook Air which I just upgraded the SSD in.  The old SSD had a windows install which I have been unable to clone onto the new SSD (perhaps that is the solution I am looking for ...).  \nIdeally, I would like to boot Win 10 from the external SSD - is this possible and if so can you point me to the right methods to get the current partition acting as a bootable drive?\n\nA: If you have the old drive in an external drive case then connect it to your Mac and the hold down the option key at boot. The Mac will then give you the option to select the boot drive.\n", "Q: Plugging MacBook Pro's display assembly onto MacBook Air Logic Board As a temporary replacement, can I plug a MacBook Pro 13\" mid 2009's display assembly onto my 13\" mid 2011 MacBook Air's logic board?\nIt is ok if it cannot close, or is not transportable. All I need is to be able to troubleshoot my MacBook Air. \nI am wondering : \n\n\n*\n\n*whether it will work\n\n*whether it can damage either the display or the laptop\n\n\nA: Technically speaking, it should work. \nEven though (according to Everymac.com), the 2009 MBP display has a resolution of 1280x800 and the 2011 MacBook Air has a display of 1400x900 it is capable of a resolution of 1280x800.\nMacBook Air:\n \nHow you are implementing it, however, will be th how you make the connection.  With a little research on iFixit.com, you can see that the LVDS connecorts for the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air are on opposite sides of the logic board\n\n\n(Left Image is MacBook Pro and right image is MacBook Air)\nSo, even though closing and mobility is not a big concern, you would have to at least turn the display the \"wrong way round\" to just make the connection.\nIf you do attempt this, I highly advise you to isolate the logic board from any potential shorts by putting a silicone or plastic barrier (think place mat) over the logic board.\n\nA: According to people on iFixit, NO.\nIt seems that the pinouts of the connectors on Macbook Pros and Macbook Airs are different, and thus while it is physically possible to plug a Macbook Pro screen on a Macbook Air, doing so would cause very serious damage, to the motherboard and/or the screen itself.\n", "Q: Recommendation for minimal Mac to run iOS Simulator I am rather new to Mac and iOS. I have been a Linux, Windows and iPad user to this point. \nI am considering getting a Mac, mainly for the purpose of running an iOS simulator. (I am sure I will discover other joys of being a Mac user, but simulating an iPhone is my top priority.)\nIs there any known minimal CPU/RAM/storage capacity needed to be able to run up to 2 parallel iPhone simulators?  Is Xcode required for this purpose?\nAny pointers would be appreciated.\n\nA: All current Mac models are capable of running the iOS simulator (and yes, you need Xcode for that, but you'll need Xcode anyway for development). \nApple has a website for developers at https://developer.apple.com, where you should be able to find more or less anything required to get started.\n\nA: The iOS Simulator is only distributed as part of Xcode.  The minimal Mac (any recent model) that supports Xcode will also support the Simulator.  Multiple instances of the Simulator can be run from the macOS/OSX command line (not from Xcode).\nWhen I ran a small app on the iOS Simulator instance, it showed less than 3 GB of virtual memory and maybe 100 to 200 MB of real memory in use.\n", "Q: iCloud account locked for security reasons I've been having troubles with my iCloud account on my iPhone lately and it recently became really annoying in the sense that i can't do basic things such as updating apps.\nBasically i have been told that due to security reasons i had to verify my account. Following that procedure i was given a security phone number entry to get some sort of key to reinitialize my account's password. Here's the twist though : I no longer have that phone number and I don't have any sort of key recovery either. Ultimately i just thought of logging out of the iCloud account - side question here, can anybody tell me what kind of data I exactly lose when I log off the iCloud session on the iphone ? - but then i realised that to logg OFF the account i had to logg IN that same account I do not have the logs of. Am I doing something wrong or is this kind of an irrelevant way to deal with people who lost their logs ?\nThank you for reading/helping out.\n\nA: It looks like you have to work with Apple to recover your account. Start here and when you get to the two-factor authentication steps, there will be a button with text along the line of \"I don't have access to my authentication device\" and by clicking this you can start a process which will allow Apple to manually verify your identity and restore control of the account to you.\n\nA: \nI can't see any button as such anywhere around the website\n", "Q: Which ios devices support​ offline speech recognition Which ios devices allow a user to do speech recognition (the microphone in the keyboard to type) when there is no internet connection (or a slow connection).\nMy brand new iPad mini cannot do it but some other devices can.\nIs there a list or some other way to know?\n\nA: It may be only those devices with the A9 processor.  If so, that would be iPhone 6s, 6s+, and iPad 7th Generation. \nIt seems logical that the A10 (iPhone 7, 7+) would also do it, but I don't know.\n", "Q: Is there a limit as to how many apple TVs i can connect to 1 iTunes account? Im speccing a house that has 8 individual TVs. The plan is to have an apple TV local to each TV. Will i have an issue with limits as to how many apple TVs i can connect to 1 iTunes account ? \nIm based in the UK, not sure if that makes a difference in relation to the terms & conditions that govern this.\n\nA: Use Home Sharing in iTunes, and sign into each ATV's \"iTunes and App Store\" account setting with the same account, and you'll be all set.  You can also set the ATV's to require the acct password to purchase content (or even to download free content), so you don't have to worry about guests/kids/etc purchasing content.\n\nA: You are possibly in violation of the iTunes license in the us if you exceed 10 iTunes account authorizations total, 5 of which can be a computer. See under the redownload section\n\nAssociated Devices Rules: You can have 10 devices (but only a maximum of 5 computers) signed in with your Apple ID at one time.\n\nApple Music also has a 10 device limit. Lastly, the terms are for personal, non-commercial use. I doubt Apple would go after some using 20 tv personally, but you never know if your account looks like it's being used not for personal, non-commercial use. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/\nI would set up family sharing and run one account on the 8 tv and keep your master account on your computers and devices. \nYou could also explore MDM like jamfnow or Apple Configurator if you want to automate updates and setup for more than a handful of devices. \nOddly, apple exempts iOS devices but not tvOS devices from this authorization / sign in language. ( See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201251 )\nAs long as you don't need redownloads, don't need simultaneous use of tv-like/Netflix streaming or Apple Music on any/all devices or have any Macs under the same Apple ID, you should be fine with dozens of Apple TV under one AppleID/iTunes account per the license in the U.S. or U.K. \n", "Q: Chrome on macOS suddenly rejects self signed certificates I have been happily using self signed certificates for locally hosted sites running on apache2 for a couple of years.  Today one of those certificates expired - no biggie, I recreated it and replaced the cert in my keychain.  However, Chrome is now giving me an error when I try to visit the site:\n\nCertificate Error\n  There are issues with the site's certificate chain (net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID).\n\nSo I thought maybe the cert I had generated was dodgy.  But no - all of my other (unexpired) self signed certs have stopped working too!  Is it a coincidence?  I don't know.\nI thought maybe it didn't like my 'common name' (which was com06, e.g. https://com06/) so I tried with com06.dev.

This will allow you to reissue your certificates when time allows it.\nOn OSX this can be achieved using the following command:\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome EnableCommonNameFallbackForLocalAnchors -bool true\n\n\nA: The issue was the missing Subject Alternative Name (SAN), which was not being filled in when I generated my self signed certs using openssl.  However, this excellent answer explains how to generate compatible certs using open ssl.\nTo check if your cert contains an SAN, use openssl x509 -in my.crt -text\n", "Q: Macbook lists all WLAN-networks of another machine. How and why was they shared? Maintaining my wife's MacbookPro, that never left the house over many years, i've found in the list of preferred WiFi-networks ALL networks, that i was ever connected to worldwide with another Macbook, even a complete new one. Also all networks, we was ever connected to with our iPhones are listed on this Mac.\nWe don't use a shared iCloud-account. The only thing in common is, that all those devices are connected with the same WiFi at home quiet often.\nAlthough it's not an issue here for me ;), maybe it will be for others getting leaked their locations where they've stored a WLAN-connection that shouldn't be visible to colleagues, partners, children and so on.\nMy question is: how and why are the networks shared across machines and across accounts/different persons? Isn't it a privacy issue? I don't know if passwords to the networks are also present on her machine, because i don't know how to test it without travelling. If so, she could connect into the networks of several companies i have worked for recently\n\nA: All stored wifi are stored in the user and system keychains. You can open up Keychain Access and search for all known / saved networks in the system and your user account. \nRepeat for other user accounts and you'll know how or when they arrived. \niCloud Keychain syncing seems the most logical source along with not changing the default \"remember networks I have joined\" but rather than speculate, you can go to the source keychains. \n", "Q: iPhone 4 Internet Problems I think my phone is broken but I am not sure.

Like I said, I can use apps that require little data usage but nothing large. It is definitely connected. Even if I switch to my mobile data I still have this problem. Please help.\n\nA: Try enabling your airplane mode for 10 seconds. Then disable and try accessing your App Store/apps. If this does not fix it. Do a hard reset. \nHold close iPhone button/sleep and the home button, till the screen blacks. Wait a few seconds and then hold the close iPhone/sleep button to turn it back on. (iPhone 4's top button)\nIf you don't trust the hard reset idea, google it. \nHope this helps. :)\n", "Q: Is there any Keychain extension for Chrome? I am using 1Password, but it's not free and I'm thinking about migrating to free OS app - Keychain. Is there anything similar to 1Password extension but for Kechain? I want to use the Keychain only for logins in Chrome and often using many logins to the single page.\nI like the way 1Password works. I simply click on the icon and select the username. The extension automatically fills in login details and logs me in. Can I do the same on Chrome with Apple Keychain?\nThanks for help.\n\nA: Actually there's no official way to do what you want and I recommend you to avoid third parts extensions available somewhere on the internet that could endanger your passwords and personal datas. You can use your Google Account Keychain but you will be able to use the passwords stored on it only on chrome browsers signed and synchronized with your Google Account.\n", "Q: Is iTunes uploading my music to the \"cloud\"?

mac's native ssh have no problem. It is only the hackintosh. Any ideas where I can troubleshoot next?\nThanks in advance.\nNote: I can ssh TO the hackintosh no problem, just not from it.\n\nA: The issue is ssh is waiting for a connection to your ssh-agent. You can test this by running SSH_AUTH_SOCK= ssh git@github.com.\nIf this is indeed the issue (as it was for me), then you probably have multiple LaunchAgents that are listening on the socket at SSH_AUTH_SOCK and one of them is doing the wrong thing. For example, I had one from MacPorts that was trying to run /opt/local/bin/ssh-agent -l but that ssh-agent did not exist any longer.\nYou should have one LaunchAgent for ssh-agent in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openssh.ssh-agent.plist but you may have others in /Library/LaunchAgents or ~/Library/LaunchAgents. If so, unload the ssh-agent LaunchAgents using launchctl unload or simply delete them and logout and back in (or maybe restart, I'm not sure if a logout is sufficient). Hopefully, that should fix your problem.\n\nA: After setting up a new M2 machine, I had this problem after migrating configs from another Intel machine.\nTH's advice was the most useful for me.\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK= ssh git@github.com\n\nwould throw at least Access Denied, anything other than hanging.\nIn my case, inside this LaunchAgent, there is a command \"ssh-agent -l\". If I run it manually, even from root, it would throw\n\"launch_activate_socket(): No such process\". \n\nI could mitigate/understand the issue if I just run \"ssh-agent\" in the foreground. I could not trace the issue with -l flag. I know it's important long-term for Keychain's access. I reinstalled Mac again, this time without applying migration from another machine. I tend to blame Apple here for the faulty migration experience.\n", "Q: Does disabling \"System Integrity Protection\" in El Cap cause shutdown/restart/logout issues? I have an older M-Audio Firewire audio interface that I use with my Mid 2011 Mac Mini. It's running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6. M-Audio never made drivers for this version of OS X, so I have to disable \"System Integrity Protection\" for the audio interface to work. I do this by booting to recovery > Terminal: csrutil disable then rebooting normally. \nHowever, I have an issue where I cannot logout, restart or shutdown \"cleanly.\" What I typically do is run the sudo restart now command to reboot, or sudo pkill loginwindow to log out. EDIT: What I mean here is OS X (El Cap) is getting \"stuck\" (just hanging indefinitely) when I try to either a.)logout b.)restart or c.)shutdown. It just does not work, so I use terminal commands to force it, but I want to stop having to do this. \nCould this issue be related to disabling SIP? EDIT: I have disabled SIP, no change. They are not related. \n\nA: This was a software issue, after all.

Every time I open iTunes, whether with a brand new local library or an external drive library I've had for several years, the app crashes. It doesn't throw an error or anything, it just closes. I've tried, of course, opening it without a library to create a new one, and also booting in safe mode. Neither of these have helped. I've also tried reinstalling iTunes itself.\nI do have iTunes Match on my account, but am not an Apple Music user.\nI read somewhere that I could try clearing out the iBooks library, and so I tried this. At first I thought it might be helping, as it took a little while for it to crash, but it still crashed. There does seem to be some inconsistency in how long it takes to crash when it opens, but this doesn't appear to be related to anything I do differently.\nWhat might be happening, and what additional things could I try?\n\nA: I realize this is quite an old question but I encountered this issue myself and managed to solve it, so I'm answering in case it helps someone (maybe even the OP). I am on Windows machine but perhaps it's the same solution on Mac as well(in some cases).\nFirst I narrowed down the problem to be related to the internet connection. I disconnected from the internet and the crash no longer occurred when having internet connection.\nI updated the network and chipset drivers (as this article explained) but the crash still occurred. \nUltimately, I connected to a wireless hotspot only to see the crash no longer happens, so I understood that the problem was the way I connected to the internet.\nSince I was behind a corporate proxy, changing the proxy server fixed the issue\n", "Q: I cannot see Time Machine in Finder to eject it On my MacBook Pro, running macOS Sierra, Time Machine is not visible in Finder as an option, so I can't eject it.\n\nA: If you want to be safe, power down your Mac and then disconnect the drive. If something is stuck, the os will alert you to the specific program so you can decide to wait. Most drives can be repaired in disk utility over night, but time machine drives can take days to \"repair\" so I would recommend not pulling the drive if you are uncertain that it ejected cleanly. \nThe restart also fixes 95% of the cases where thing should like this happen and your Finder sidebar should be accurate again. \n", "Q: If I buy iCloud storage can I update my phone and other apps as well? like what is it exactly do I get more space for my phone and everything? Also if I decide to cancel will apps or photos delete?\n\nA: Yes, you do get more space for your iPhone in some sense. Your iPhone uses iCloud for backups (probably; you can choose not to do so), and storing photos and other documents which don't need to be on your iPhone, leaving more 'disk' space there. Note that App Store apps themselves don't take up space on iCloud - they're backed up 'for free', but their settings and document might take up space.\nIf you downgrade / cancel your subscription, the official Apple support page only mentions you cannot 'upload' anymore to iCloud. While that doesn't mean the photos will stay there forever, it does imply you get the chance to remove certain content in order to get below your new limit, so it is at least kept for a while.\n", "Q: Encrypted external drive won't mount anymore I have a 1 TB external drive I use for Time Machine, and as manual backup external drive.

I have Sierra installed on my Laptop. I wish to know if: \n\n\n*\n\n*Installing MacTex will overwrite my old MacTex or retain it (I\nactually want it overwritten!)?\n\n*If it does not overwrite, then what measures should be taken to completely remove the older version and switch to the 2016\nversion?\n\n\nI am asking these questions since the explanation provided on www.tug.org/mactex is not sufficiently clear, and it add more to the confusion. \n\nA: Installing MacTeX 2016 will create a new 2016 directory in /usr/local/texlive/ with all of TeX and friends in it. It will also update all symlinks etc. to point to the new versions. So you can run sudo rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/2015 afterwards to remove the old version. This will lead to some broken links in /Library/TeX but I never bothered with cleaning them up and they won't be used anyway.\n", "Q: Unable to enter directories in Finder after moving directories to NAS I have a NAS, which I use for storing my old photos. When moving the remainder of my 2016 photos, the following problem occurred, but without any error message during the move operation. The move operation was done by holding the cmd-button while dragging and dropping in Finder.\nIn Finder on OS X version 10.11.6, the directory looks like this:\n\nUsing Finder, I can enter directories like 2016-10-15, but not the ones with different icons. 2016-11-27 is a directory, and 2016-12-01 should not be shown twice, but is a result of the erroneous move operation.\nI have researched online to figure this out, but have not yet found a solution. One of the possible explanations was extended attributes. I ran a xattr -c * to clear all of the attributes. This did remove the attributes, but didn't solve the problem.\nI can enter the directories using Terminal.\nmachinename:2016 user$ ls -al 2016-11-27\ntotal 34600\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff       264 24 Jan 21:18 .\ndrwxrwxr-x  1 user  staff      7606 16 Mar 20:14 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   1339112 24 Jan 21:05 2016-11-27 08.47.29.jpg\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 user  staff  12069896 27 Nov 16:58 DSC_0151.JPG\n\nAny other ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: From the symptoms you describe I suspect a damaged .DS_Store file in the parent folder. \nTry deleting it while the folder is closed in the Finder. Close all open windows in the Finder, then in Terminal rm .DS_Store while in the directory. This should be the same directory you were in when you ran the command in your question. Now open . will open the directory in the Finder and all should be OK. If that doesn't work you could also try deleting the .DS_Store in the directory above.\nIf neither of those work then I would try copying the entire folder tree in Terminal using the cp command.\n\nA: Finally managed to find a solution using the following steps:\n1) Took a complete backup of the main photo folder using tar.\n2) Figured out which file types I had (while keeping in mind that jpg and JPG are not identical)\nfind . -type f | awk -F . '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $2,\":\",$1}'\n3) Then copied the files using rsync, specifying each file type from the above result (it was the 2016-folder that had issues, so I copied the files I positively knew I wanted to 2016-test):\nrsync -zarv --include=\"*/\" --include=\"*.AVI\" --include=\"*.JPG\"  --include=\"*.MOV\" --include=\"*.jpg\"  --include=\"*.mov\"  --include=\"*.mp4\"  --include=\"*.png\" --include=\"*.ini\" --exclude=\"*\" 2016/ 2016-test/\n", "Q: Is there a limit to how old a device/iOS version iTunes can backup? I have an old iPod touch which cannot be upgraded past iOS 3.1.3 and the (currently) newest version of iTunes (12.6.0.100). iTunes does not allow me to create a backup of that iPod to my Mac (the buttons and settings in the Backup section are just grayed out). That's not terribly bad, but it got me interested: Is there a minimum iOS version or other restriction that prevents recent versions of iTunes from creating a backup of a device? Is this documented somewhere?\nI think it's important to know because I may want to migrate my data to a newer device, regardless of how old the old device is.\n\nA: Yes, the latest versions of iTunes (at least going back through Spring of 2016 & possibly winter 2015; I don't quite remember) no longer support the iOS 3 and lower backup protocol. I haven't found it documented anywhere, I just know when people started emailing me about the issue.\nUnfortunately, any version of iTunes that speaks BackupAgent (the old protocol) won't support an iPhone running iOS 10. I actually don't know if BackupAgent2 will handle an iOS 3 backup. If it doesn't, you would need to make a backup of the iOS 3 device using an old iTunes, restore to an iOS 9 device using that same version of iTunes, make a new backup of the iOS 9 device, then update iTunes and restore to the iOS 10 device.\nDepending on what you need to migrate, there may be easier ways :)\n", "Q: OSX, different keyboards with different input methods possible? I was wondering if it were possible to tie in a different input method for each keyboard on a computer with multiple keyboards?\nThe reason I ask is I use a wireless keyboard with my macbook pro and thus have two keyboards available, and I use both English and Chinese for input.\nOne hassle I have switching between the input methods, even with an assigned hotkey.  \nSince I have two keyboards, wouldn't it be nice to have one keyboards input for one of the input methods and the second keyboard for the second input.\nIs there a way to do this so I can change input methods by typing on a different keyboard?\nThanks.\n\nA: Based on Tom Gewecke's input, I've done the following:\nInstalled Karabiner from: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en\n(note that Karabiner 10.22.0 does not work with macOS 10.12.x at the time of this reply)\nInstalled this mapping into private.xml from: https://gist.github.com/ylorn/43b589daf6d621a7fc47 \n(I've changed it to left shift key and control space to match my preferred international input keybindings)\nThis approach does not allow me to set default language inputs per keyboard, but does allow me to more quickly switch between them.  An acceptable compromise until I can find something better.\nAfter asking Karabiner to reload the xml files, I can now tap the left shift key to switch inputs quickly.\n--\nIn macOS 10.12, you can achieve the same functionality with the caps log key, without Karabiner, by enabling the \"Use the Caps Lock key to switch to and from US\"\n\nA: This app should work to solve this problem.\n", "Q: Make terminal command use both CPU cores This may be a bit of a easy question, but I couldn't find anything about it after googling a bit, sorry!\nIs there any way to make a command use both of my CPU cores? I am currently processing some PDF files using GhostScript, but whenever I run the command in the terminal, it uses only around 100% of my CPU. I have to run two instances of it to get it to use 200% of my CPU and thus be twice as fast. Even then, for some reason, 40% of my CPU is \"idle,\" according to Activity Monitor, which may imply that I can run more instances.\nIs there a way to make this GhostScript command use all of my CPU to be as fast as possible, without having to manually run multiple instances of the command?\n\nA: Depending on the number of PDFs you have to process and the nature of the tasks, you may consider installing GNU parallel in brew.\nGNU parallel allows you to execute several jobs concurrently. Example:\nparallel ::: yes > /dev/null yes > /dev/null\n\nAn example script (containing small errors e.g. line 13 should start with find instead of ind!) how to use parallel and ghostscript can be found here: Quick shell script for parallel OCR on PDFs using ghostscript and tesseract\nPlease also check the extensive man pages of parallel.\n", "Q: External keyboard modifiers with Sierra stopped working (when typing non-modifier key on MacBook Pro Retina) When I upgraded to Sierra, my shift key on the external keyboard stopped working when I press a key on my MacBook Pro Retina's keyboard.\nI have a setup where my left hand is using the external keyboard (to avoid pain due to chest compression), while my right hand is on the MacBook's keyboard.\nNow when I press the left shift and a letter on the MacBook keyboard, the \nletter does not come capitalized. In El Capitan (and all other versions) this worked...\nAny hints?\nEDIT:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's not just shift. It's command, alt, shift, control.\n\n*the modifier keys do work physically (when used with other keys on the same keyboard).\n\nA: [SOLUTION!] Ha!!! Now it started working. Replying to my own question (related to Skeleton Bow's answer/suggestion - thanks) : Looks like Karabiner Elements kicked it the right way somehow. Even though I did not exactly change anything relevant, just installed it and opened it. Maybe the fact of installing /using karabiner forces sierra to use the old ways of handling modifier keys? Big thanks to @Skeleton Bow for the help in troubleshooting and for suggesting Karabiner Elements!\n\nA: It might be that the shift on that keyboard does not work anymore. In that case, you should use another button as the shift button. You could try, for example, remapping the caps lock button (or some other button if you want to keep its functionality) to the left shift button using Karabiner Elements (courtesy of Tim for showing me this!). This will enable you to press the caps lock button on the external keyboard to emulate the shift button's functionality.\n", "Q: How to stop Finder from jumping to folder when dragging and dropping?

Also sending the images via email.\nWhat can we do to save the images from the old phone?\n\nA: Try the following: \nConnect your iPhone with your Mac and start \"Image Capture\" for importing photos.\nIn general, the circled explanation mark indicates that those photos have not been loaded from iCloud. It may download with network connection (mostly Wi-Fi only). If there are no photos on iCloud this might be because of file corruption on iCloud. \nAlso, iOS support for iPhone 4 stopped with iOS 7.1.2 - iCloud Photo library needs iOS 8.3 or newer. Your device therefore only supports iCloud My Photo Stream which only contains your newest pictures. There is no chance for your full library to be synced with iCloud.\n(This does not count for iPhone 4s which supports iOS 9.3.5)\nOne last thing: Make sure photos are not indicated as \"Transferred from Mac\" (transferred photos can not be saved on any other Mac as the original source and won´t be shown on your current Mac).\nHopefully you´ll be able to access your photos. I hope these information may help you to understand your situation.

If it doesn't work on different computers you have narrowed it down the the WD unit itself.  If the problem was with your Mac, it wouldn't be present on a different computer.\n\n*The correct response  provided by diskutil for disk1.  It's highly unlikely (though not impossible), that if the enclosure wasn't functioning you would at least get erroneous information back or no information at all.  The WD enclosure is reporting back that there is a drive but it has no operating system.  Chances are, it's the drive.\nHowever, you can take it a step further and do some additional diagnostics.  The key here is to isolate the major individual components of the WD enclosure - the logic board and the drive itself.  \nSo, to diagnose this you will need either of the following\n\n\n*\n\n*a known working hard drive \n\n*a 3.5\" HDD to USB adapter (I recommend this option for reasons that will become clear momentarily).\n\n\nYou will need to disassemble the MyBook.  From my research, the case appears to be held in place with \"snaps\" which you just pry off so it shouldn't be too difficult to get into.  There's a straightforward set of instructions on Instructables.com\nDepending on the option you took above - you either need to change the drive in the MyBook  or plug the old drive into the USB to SATA adapter.\nIf one component works (i.e the drive), then you know for a fact that the other (i.e. the enclosure) has failed; or vice versa.\nIf it is your drive, the USB to SATA adapter will allow you to attempt to recover your files.  I have personally used Disk Drill with excellent results (it's free to use the diagnostic portion and to see if you can recover data).  You will be able to make an image of the drive and attempt recovery on the image lessening the chance of total failure of the drive.\nIf it happens to be the enclosure, the USB to SATA adapter will allow you to continue to use the disk drive while you come up with a more permanent solution (the MyBook is essentially the same thing but with a more elegant enclosure).\nIf you choose the \"drive method\" you will still be able to get the same diagnostic results, except you won't be able to transfer or rescue any data if it happens to be the MyBook enclosure that's bad.\nNow, as preventing it from happening again - well, this is a spinning hard drive which means it mechanical.  It's going to fail.  The only thing you can do is mitigate data loss by having a backup\n\nA: Crazy thing for me - my Macbook Pro Retina suddenly stopped recognizing all my external drives - tried all of the recommended restarts - safe mode, PRAM, SMC, checked power cord.  All drives lit & spun, but not seen in system report, Finder or Disk Utility.  However, iPhone in either USB port did show up. Tried one last thing - had external drive plugged in, opened Photoshop, and in preferences went to scratch disk - and voila - there it was.  Ejected, then tried with next - and it then showed up.  With third disk I did not open Photoshop but it mounted correctly - maybe a little time lag but it's a 4T drive, so might have needed time to mount.\nSo, maybe if you have a software program that needs to find the disk (not Time Machine - did not work) - you might try finding it that way.  If nothing else - do a free trial of Photoshop CC (or one month for about $10) - might save some grief/money.\nWhoops - just saw where drive did not work on other computers.  Maybe someone looking for answers to my issue will see this (newbie contributer here)\n\nA: You can go into Disk Utility and try to re mount the disk (but I found that it won't always work).\n\nA: I dont belong this this software company, but I just mount my external drive successfully with it. I tried Disk Utility on 2 different MacBook Pro which didn't work. \nhttps://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/\nI installed this for testing purposes on different format usb. and tried mount on this works.\n", "Q: Difference between iTunes Connect App Version and Build Version When preparing an App for iOS App Store release in iTunes Connect, there is a field under the App Store tab where you can type in a version number.\nBut when uploading the builds, under the Activity tab we have a version number that is taken from the info.plist in Xcode.\nWhy are there two places for the version number?  What is the difference between them?  How are they supposed to be used?  Is there a best practice for this?\n\n\n\nA: It may be necessary to submit multiple builds when submitting or updating an app (due to finding bugs before the app completes review, etc.).  iTC requires that the build numbers be different (and ascending) for each subsequent build submission for same version update to an app.  Thus two different fields, one version number for the App store visible (e.g. marketing) version of the app or app update, and one build number for one or more uploads before app review starts or completes (and without changing the App store visible or marketing version number).\nIt's also handy when testing many dozens of incremental builds of an app on your devices and iOS Simulators to have some way of telling them apart other than mucking with the marketing version number (which you might want to be a nice clean looking 2.0 or something).\n", "Q: Falsy estimates of RAM usage with command line tools I am trying to measure the RAM usage of MyProcess args\nGNU time\nFollowing this post\ngtime -v ./MyProcess args\n\n[..]\nMaximum resident set size (kbytes): 303316992 # (303 GB)\n[..]\n\nI clearly don't have 303 GB of RAM on my computer!\nzsh - time\nFollowing this post \nzsh\nTIMEFMT='%J   %U  user %S system %P cpu %*E total'$'\\n'\\\n'avg shared (code):         %X KB'$'\\n'\\\n'avg unshared (data/stack): %D KB'$'\\n'\\\n'total (sum):               %K KB'$'\\n'\\\n'max memory:                %M MB'$'\\n'\\\n'page faults from disk:     %F'$'\\n'\\\n'other page faults:         %R'\n\ntime ./MyProcess args\n\navg shared (code):         0 KB\navg unshared (data/stack): 0 KB\ntotal (sum):               0 KB\nmax memory:                73204 MB # (73 GB)\npage faults from disk:     0\nother page faults:         18528\n\nI don't have 73 GB of RAM on my machine either!\ntstime\nFollowing this post...

When setting up FileVault 2 on a computer, you're presented with 2 recovery options - storing the recovery key with your iCloud account / Apple ID, and displaying the recovery key (for you to write down / save somewhere yourself). However, after doing some research, I found some posts that claim to be able to extract FileVault recovery keys from users' iCloud accounts, which makes me wonder if storing the recovery key with iCloud is the best solution. For a point of reference, I also looked at Apple's whitepaper on FileVault, which explains that the recovery key is protected by a \"wrapping\" key generated by hashing the responses to 3 security questions. Still, if this exploit's legit, as far as I can tell this would only matter if someone had physical access to your computer.\nGiven these two recovery options, which would be more secure?\n\n\n*\n\n*Store recovery key with iCloud\n\n*Store recovery key in a password manager, where it's synced to multiple devices via a service like Dropbox\n\n\nI'm currently thinking option 2 would be, because there's the extra layer of the password manager vault even if the file syncing service were compromised, but that might be equivalent to the wrapping key hashing Apple adds.\n\nA: Saving it somewhere yourself is more secure as long as that somewhere else is memorized in your own brain. Otherwise the answer to this isn't static.\niCloud can have vulnerabilities and so can Dropbox. Knowing about some vulnerabilities only informs you about those that have become public. Right now we might possibly know about a vulnerability in iCloud, but tomorrow that could be patched and 12 vulnerabilities in Dropbox could be revealed. \nI would consider them to be basically equal if you aren't going to memorize the recovery key.\nAs an aside, I don't memorize my own keys, I keep them in Dropbox using 1Password\n\nA: \nWhich would be more secure?\n\nThe answer to this can only be determined by you\nWhat you have to do is find the balance between usability and security and that balance can only be determined by what you are comfortable with.\nIt's not so much where you store your passwords/recovery keys/etc. but how you store them.  There are many levels of encryption that you could employ from a basic AES-256 to using Steganography to embed triple encrypted salted and hashed keys.\nThe more complex you make it, the more secure; the cost being the more inconvenient it becomes to access your data.  Likewise, the corollary is also true, the less complex the security, the less secure but the payback is easier access to your data.\nSo, what you have to do is a simple risk assesment:\n\n\n*\n\n*The value of the data to you (i.e. what's it worth to you?)\n\n*The importance of the data (can you live without it?)\n\n*The cost of the data (how much did/would it cost you to (re)create?)\n\n*How accessible do you need it (every day, every year, once in a lifetime?)\n\n\nGranted, this is a very abridged version, but should suffice for this scenario.\nUse the answers to the question to see what makes the most sense keeping in mind that the moment you place the data on someone else's servers (meaning the cloud) you inherently introduce risk into the equation.\nAhh...but with that last statement, you might be thinking \"I should store it offline.\"  That's a possibility, but then you introduce the issue of losing your data should you misplace the device (i.e. USB flash) that you placed it on.\nWhat do I do?\nMy critical stuff is on a USB that is disguised as an innocent looking object.  It's backed up to another USB that is placed in a safe in an undisclosed location.\nMy \"not so critical stuff\" is encrypted, then put on a cloud provider for ease of access.\nBut, that's what works for me.  YMMV\n\nA: Here is an example of how a disk recovery key can be extracted from iCloud to allow for decryption of your disk. In general, no real method is safer than the other. The convenience of iCloud makes it an acceptable place to store your recovery key. Remember if storing it in iCloud, there is no good way to browse and extract your key unless you follow the steps outlined here.\nOther acceptably safe options include storing it in 1Password, Dropbox. Paper print outs of the recovery key are prone to being misplaced, at least with me.\n", "Q: Convert between FileVault 2 and Disk Utility encryption? I know of two ways to enable full-disk encryption in macOS Sierra:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on FileVault 2, or\n\n*Boot to recovery, reformat the disk as encrypted, and reinstall macOS.\n\n\nI've read in several places around the web that the underlying encryption technology is the same either way, and the difference is just how the decryption key is obtained at boot time.  With FileVault, a user's login password also serves to unlock the disk, but when you encrypt with Disk Utility, you choose a separate password just for the encryption.\nI've found that if the disk was encrypted via Disk Utility at install time, you can also enable a user to unlock it via the FileVault preferences window.  Then, at startup, you can unlock the disk using either the disk password or the user's login password.\nHaving gotten into this hybrid state, though, I don't see a way to get out of it.  What I'd like to know is:\n\n\n*\n\n*After I've enabled a user to unlock the disk, is there a way to remove the old disk password (that was created with Disk Utility at install time) and replace it with a recovery key, so it's like a normal FileVault setup that just uses user passwords?\n\n*Alternatively, is there a way to remove the user from FileVault so that only the disk password will work?\n\n\nAnd, on a related note:\n\n\n*\n\n*If FileVault was enabled in the usual way (starting from an unencrypted Mac), is there a way to add a disk password that's separate from the user login passwords, like what I'd have if I'd encrypted via Disk Utility at install time?\n\n\nA: As it turns out, I found the answers to most of this not long after I asked the question.  The command-line fdesetup program offers some additional options.\nRemoving Disk Password\nRun sudo fdesetup list -extended and look for the UUID labeled \"Disk Passphrase\".  Then run sudo fdesetup remove -uuid <UUID> to remove it.\nThis can be used to remove the disk password that was created via Disk Utility, leaving only user login passwords for unlocking the disk.\nRemoving User from FileVault\nRun sudo fdesetup list (-extended isn't needed) to see what users are authorized to unlock the disk, then use sudo fdesetup remove -user <USER> or sudo fdesetup remove -uuid <UUID>.\nThis can be used to de-authorize users so that only the disk password can be used.\nAdding Recovery Key\nRun sudo fdesetup changerecovery -personal.  This will prompt for a password (anything that's currently enabled to unlock the disk), then display the new recovery key.  (Write it down!)\nRemoving Recovery Key\nRun sudo fdesetup removerecovery -personal.  As above, this will prompt for a password.\nAdding Disk Password\nI couldn't find a way to do this in-place — sudo diskutil cs passwd seems like it ought to work, but it requires there to be an \"old\" disk password already.\nHowever, you can turn off FileVault using the preferences window (which decrypts the disk), then use sudo diskutil cs encryptLV <UUID> to re-encrypt it with a disk password.  This is slow, since it has to decrypt and re-encrypt all the data, but it works.\n", "Q: iCloud Photo Library If I press the 'disable and delete ' button will my photos come back onto my phone or go somewhere else ?

When I install packages manually, the typical layout looks like the following: \n├── conf\n├── lib\n├── bin\n│   ├── mvn\n│   ├── mvn.cmd\n\nBut when I install it with homebrew, almost all the files are placed in the libexec folder:\n├── bin\n│   └── mvn\n└── libexec\n    ├── bin\n    ├── boot\n    ├── conf\n    └── lib\n\nWhy is this strange layout used? It's a bit confusing when you read tool's official documentation and your paths mismatch.\n\nA: The layout was a deliberate design decision on Homebrew’s side to keep the balance between usability, maintainer sanity, and not breaking things.\nA comment in Homebrew’s source code says:\n\nInstalling JARs to \"lib\" can cause conflicts between packages.\n  For Java software, it is typically better for the formula to\n  install to \"libexec\" and then symlink or wrap binaries into \"bin\".\n\nWhy conflicts?\nTo explain what the specific conflict is and what causes it, let’s have a look at (a gross simplification of) what Homebrew does when you run brew install foo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Homebrew downloads and unpacks everything foo needs according to the formula.\n\n*Homebrew follows the installation instruction according to the formula. For example, it copies files around, applies patches, and so on. In the end, you get a keg, the folder containing the fresh installation.\n\n*For your convenience, Homebrew looks at the bin and lib directories of your keg, then symlinks everything it finds into /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib so you don’t have to.\nNote how in #3, the formula does not have a say. This helps keep complexity out of the formula definitions. A formula maintainer can never forget to create a symlink because she or he doesn’t have to; Homebrew does it automatically for everything that is in bin or lib.\nThe layout policy was (AFAIK) first codified in issue #678 of Homebrew’s legacy GitHub repository, which says:\n\nThis is expected behavior; libexec is assumed to be private-use stuff for that formula.\n\nBasically, Homebrew considers the contents of bin and lib public artifacts, i. e. things that are supposed to be called from outside the formula.\nEverything else, including the whole content of libexec, is considered an implementation detail, i. e. things for private use by the formula itself.\nBut what is the big deal with that? Could you, as an author of a formula like maven, not simply ignore those principles and instead live with a few unnecessary symlinks in /usr/local/lib, and give the user the same layout as the upstream project has?\nTurns out that yes, you could, but it’s a horrible idea, and Homebrew maintainers would rightfully refuse such a formula until fixed.\nPublishing private stuff to /usr/local/lib is a typical cause of JAR hell. (Imagine a Java-based Homebrew formula foo which uses mylib.jar v1, and another Homebrew formula bar which uses mylib.jar v2, with the version number not being part of the filename mylib.jar. Now go ahead and try to figure out why your business-critical application – which happens to use /usr/local/lib/mylib.jar because it’s in the path – only works on that 50% of your machines where foo has been installed after bar but not vice versa. This is an example of the conflict mentioned at the beginning.)\ntl;dr Whatever you put into lib, Homebrew will symlink to /usr/local/lib for you. Putting a JAR you depend on into /usr/local/lib is a bad thing to do and leads to JAR hell.\n", "Q: iMac 27-inch late 2015 upgrade RAM with higher frequency My current RAM memory has 1867Mhz and I want to upgrade with 2133Mhz. \nCan this cause any problems?\nThe RAM is compatible with my iMac, at least the manufacturer says so.\n\nA: If you mix 2133 with 1866 it will all run at 1866.\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace all memory sticks with DDR3 2133MHz\n\n*Use quality components (Crucial, Kingston) or you may encounter freezing issues\n", "Q: Have I been hacked or compromised from an answered face time call from South Africa? at 603 EDT I received a face time video call but somehow hung it up without answering (I was sleeping) at 605 they called back and since I was sleeping didn't really pay attention to it and answered it.

What I have:\n - 27\" 2012 Mac with 3TB Fusion Drive\n - 3.4 GHz Core i7 (3770) (\"Ivy Bridge\") processor\n - 24 GB RAM\nI was trying to set it up with a Boot Camp partition for Windows 10. The story so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Machine came with virgin install of Sierra. I restored from my Time Machine backup of my iMac 9,1 (also with Sierra installed), and everything worked normally.\n\n*The new machine inherited the Time Machine backup from the old one and was fully backed up.\n\n*I ran Boot Camp Assistant to download the Boot Camp files, put the Windows 10 iso on a flash drive, and partition the disk.\n\n*During this process, I was only able to choose a maximum partition size for Windows of 640 GB, with the Mac partition being about 2454 GB if I recall correctly.\n\n*The partitioning failed with an error message, and it told me to repair the disk in Disk Utility\n\n*I went to Disk Utility and performed repair (on the 'whole disk' and the disk volume named Macintosh HD). No problems were found and the repair exited normally.\n\n*I continued with Boot Camp Assistant, which had stayed open, and tried to partition the disk again. As before, 640 GB was the maximum allowable for Windows.\n\n*The process appeared to hang, I left it for over half an hour before force quitting. I guess this was a bad mistake, perhaps it just takes a long time anyway.\n\n*After force quitting, the Mac slowed to a crawl. I entered Disk Utility which showed the capacity as about 3 TB and the used space about 0.04 TB less than that. Before this, the used space was about 1.6 TB.\n\n*I ran First Aid in Disk Utility and after this process the Disk Capacity was reduced to 1.67 TB with 0.04 TB free. The computer continued to run at a crawl, presumably because of the lack of free space on the disk.\n\n*I booted off my Time Machine backup, which booted into the recovery environment.\n\n*I erased the Fusion Drive, which restored the capacity to 3TB.\n\n*Next, possibly another big mistake, I chose Restore and then chose my Time Machine disk. But I did this from inside Disk Utility rather than from the main menu of the recovery environment.\n\n*The restore completed and verified. The Fusion Drive was now named 2TBTimeMachine instead of Macintosh HD.\n\n*When I tried to reboot, the Apple logo appeared with a progress bar, and then a grey screen with a circle with a diagonal line through it.\n\n*I booted from the Time Machine disk again (to the recovery environment). I ran First Aid, first on the whole disk, which appeared to fix one thing. I can't remember what this was but I remember it said '1 newer' of whatever it changed.\n\n*I then ran First Aid on the disk named 2TBTimeMachine (i.e. the Fusion Drive), which found several problems and reported that it successfully fixed them. I'm sorry, I don't remember what issues it found and fixed.\n\n*I tried rebooting again, which led to the same circle with diagonal line. Before that, I tried to select the startup disk from the recovery environment, which showed no startup disks available at all.\n\n*Currently I am redoing the Time Machine backup from my old Mac and intend to try and restore that to the new Mac. I am writing this from the Internet Recovery Environment on my new Mac.\n\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What mistakes did I make in the process above?\n\n*Will I be able to restore to the new disk without erasing it first (i.e. will it replace all content on the disk)? The reason I ask is because the Internet Recovery Environment seems to have an older version of Disk Utility, and I don't want to risk erasing the disk from this version of Disk Utility in case it doesn't know about Fusion Drives.\n\n*Is there any benefit to installing Mac OS X Mountain Lion from the Internet Recovery Environment? I don't know why Mountain Lion is the only option here. Is it likely to cause further problems if I install Mountain Lion and from that install upgrade to Sierra?\n\n*Do I need to 'rebuild' the Fusion Drive and can you provide or direct me to a clear set of instructions for doing this?\n\n\nA: I recommend to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable macOS Sierra installer thumb drive or if you are restricted to your iMac9,1 a bootable El Capitan installer thumb drive (same link).\n\n*Boot the iMac13,2 with the thumb drive\n\n*Open Terminal in the menubar > Utilities > Terminal\n\n*Enter diskutil list and diskutil cs list to get an overview\n\n*Destroy the LVG:\ndiskutil cs delete lvgUUID #lvgUUID: UUID of the Logical Volume Group\n\n\n*Enter exit to quit Terminal.app and open Disk Utility\n\n*Completely erase both disks (each to one volume with the names e.g. \"fusion1\" and \"fusion2\" but not \"Macintosh HD\").\n\n*Open Terminal again and get the device identifiers again: diskutil list\n\n*Create a new LVG and LV (here I assume the 120 GB SSD has the disk identifier disk0 and the 3 TB HDD disk1 - they might be different though!):\ndiskutil cs create Fusion disk0 disk1\ndiskutil cs createVolume lvgUUID jhfs+ \"Macintosh HD\" 100% #replace lvgUUID with the UUID shown in the output of the previous command\n\n\n*Enter exit to quit Terminal.app\n\n*After finishing the iMac9,1 backup to your TM backup drive, attach the drive to your iMac13,2 and in the Utilities windows choose Restore from Time Machine Backup > Select backup source > ...choose the drive and restore it to your Macintosh HD volume.\n\n*After the restore task has finished successfully, boot your iMac13,2 normally. Check if a RecoveryHD is present by opening Terminal and entering diskutil list.\n\n*If the RecoveryHD is missing, simply reinstall Sierra with the latest Sierra installer downloaded from the App Store  - which shouldn't affect your data but creates an additional RecoveryHD - or use the Recovery Partition Creator 4.\n\n", "Q: If I exclude a folder from Time Machine, will it be deleted from old backups? I want to save space on my backup drive by excluding some folders I don't care about. I also want them to be deleted from my old backups so I can keep them for longer.\nIf I add folder exclusions, will the folders also be deleted from my backup drive?\n\nA: No - once a file is saved to a backup drive, you retain the history of how that file looked. \nSimilarly - an exclusion only changes what is considered to be backed up going forward, the exclusion does not apply retroactively.\nYou would need to enter Time Machine and explicitly delete all backups of the excluded folder to have that cleanup of backed up files be surgically removed leaving the rest of the back up intact. The gear control allows you to select delete all backups of the selected file(s) and folder(s)\nThere’s also hope we can use a command line tool to script the gear UI removal of a specific file / folder from the command line. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to use `tmutil delete` or another command to prune one file from multiple backups?\n\n*Delete all backups of specific file/folder with tmutil\n\nThe only exception is if Time Machine runs out of space to make a new backup. Then and only then, when the Time Machine drive becomes full, backup copies of a file will potentially be erased. The oldest backups get purged first, so most people can get back the file from backups weeks or months ago even if the one from two years ago gets deleted.\n", "Q: Preview does not find words correctly I recently updated my OS to Sierra.

The wifi that I use at a particular library has some weird issue. I have only faced the issue at this place. The IT helpdesk is not of much help and I am unable to understand the issue. This happened, every 2-3 weeks. I go there weekly 2-3 days for a couple of hours. This is also the only wifi where I have to put a new username and password every 2 hrs. The issue usually happens the first time I try to connect in a day.\nHere is what happens, I see the wifi in full strength, but I am unable to connect to it. The IT guy tries connecting to the wifi via his android phone and it connects fine. Then I do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wifi icon>Network Preference>Advanced>Wifi>Preferred Networks>remove the wifi from that list\n\n*Restart the system\n\n*Try connecting 3-4 times, then it connects successfully.\n\n\nI don't understand why it does not connect immediately once I restart the system. What happens when you restart the system? Does it reset the dynamic IP I get in the network? All I can think of is that the wifi router here has some issue and I cannot do anything about it. But I would like to have a better way of solving the issue.\nWhat I mainly want to know, is there a way I can achieve the benefit of restarting the system instead of actually restarting it. Like a command that restarts the whole wifi part without just restarting the whole system.\n\nA: From the Wi-Fi icon the second option is Turn Wi-fi Off. Select this, wait a few seconds, then open the Wi-Fi icon again and Turn Wi-Fi On. This is how you would restart your Wi-Fi on macOS without restarting your whole computer.\nAlso to elaborate on your other question(s) - there are a multitude of networking policies and configurations that could be complicating this connection. The hardware itself could be out of date or possibly just full on users and you're connecting when someone drops off - there could be network policies in place that take extra time to validate your machine. The list is quite endless. If you are eventually able to connect it's likely that you'll need to work with your IT folks to figure out the specific issues - or just deal with this buggy connection - but you shouldn't need to reboot your entire machine to make this connection work. There's really not much difference in doing that vs. turning the Wi-Fi off and on again from the menu.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Restart Wifi Using Terminal\nOpen Terminal.app and get the Wi-Fi interface name unit by entering:\nnetworksetup -listallhardwareports | grep \"Wi-Fi\" -A 1\n\nTo turn it off with the interface name found with the previous command (e.g. en0)\nsudo ifconfig en0 down\n\nand to turn on \nsudo ifconfig en0 up\n\nwhen you try to connect with WiFi network is there any other types of networks connected (for example Ethernet or Thunderbolt Ethernet).\nIf yes, please remove that cable from your Mac machine and try reboot the machine it will connect to WiFi automatically (as per my observation).\n\nA: You can use below given command:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\nnetworksetup -removeallpreferredwirelessnetworks en0\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on\nnetworksetup -setdhcp Wi-Fi\nnetworksetup -setairportnetwork en0 <WIFI-SSID> <PASSWORD>\n\n", "Q: Why is download speed not increased using an SSD? I upgraded my hard drive from HDD to SSD.\nThere is no change in download speed. Reviewer says SSD has very good write speed, but why does that not increase download speed?\n\nA: \nReviewer says SSD has very good write speed, but why does that not increase download speed?\n\nOne has absolutely nothing to do with the other.\nTo use a car analogy, you are asking why, given that you upgraded from a Toyota to a Porsche can you not load groceries into your trunk any faster.\nYour download speed is governed by three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The speed(s) offered by your carrier \n\n*The speed your router/modem is capable of  \n\n*The bandwidth the devices on your network is capable of (i.e. your gigabit NIC card)\n\n\nIf you didn't address any/all of these points, your download speed would have no change whatsoever.\nAs for the bottlenecks addressed in the other answers, let me assure you that the data transfer rate of a SATA III interface is 6Gb/sec while your NIC (network interface card) at most will be 1Gb/sec.  Your internet, unless you live anywhere in Korea or lucky enough to live where there is Google or Comcast Fibre, it's probably around 100Mb/sec.  This mean your drive is about 600x faster than your network - the bottleneck argument is a moot point.\n\nA: I was not really pleased by either answer here, so here we are.\nWhen speaking in terms of a download speed, changing your disk drive will never have an effect on that.  There are 4^2 possible bottlenecks when downloading a file(s) from a server across the internet.\n1) NIC (Network Interface Card)\n2) Physical Ethernet cable or WiFi connection to the router\n3) LAN connection speed\n4) WAN connection speed\nAnd then the same in reverse on the server side.\nAs some comments have mentioned, it does not matter if you have a HDD connected via IDE at speeds of 5 MB/s, or a SSD that could write at crazy speeds of 10GB/s.  The network will always be the bottleneck.\nOn the higher end of ISP packages, you can get 100Mb/s.  That is Megabits, not Megabytes.  Meaning the fastest your download speed ever will be, in perfect circumstances, is 10MB/s (Megabytes).  Note: there are some fiber ISPs now offering Gigabit connections, but those are extremely pricey and usually used by very bandwidth needy businesses.\nTake this scenario below, which would be an average user setup:\n-Laptop(newer with 802.11c) connected via WiFi to a router. = 300 Mb/s\n-Cable internet connection = 25 Mb/s\n-SSD = 300 MB/s\n-Download a file from Google Drive = 2.5 Mb/s\nAs you can see, the bottle neck there is your ISP connection.  Here is another with an older laptop with a WiFi bottleneck:\n-Laptop(older with 802.11g) -> WiFi to router = 54Mb/s\n-High Internet connection tier = 100Mb/s\n-Download from Dropbox = 5.4 Mb/s\nTL;DR\nAlmost always, your bottleneck will be because of one or more of these 3 things: WiFi, ISP connection, or a slow server/ISP on the other end. Never your disk drive.\n\nA: Probably the bottleneck is not your disk but your network.\nA SATA2 hdd disk usually supports write speeds of up to 250/300MB/s. It is unlikely that you can reach those download speeds.\n\nA: Upgrading your HD will not help with download speed. A better internet connection will help you have more download speed.\n\nA: Your internet speed is a lot slower than the hard drive speed, so upgrading to a faster hard drive won't significantly increase download speed.  It is your internet connection that's limiting your download speeds, not your harddrive.\n\n", "Q: Power up after UPS initiated shutdown I have a Mac Pro with an APC UPS supply connected.

Basically I want to add music from \"Apple Music\" to playlists, so I can easily find it again. I often listen to their selected playlists and want to save the best songs from there, on my own lists.\nHowever - the checkbox option mentioned in the above, is greyed out for me. I cannot deselect it. So if I try and add music; I get a message that I must enable iCloud Storage before I can add the music to my library.\n\nAny ideas as to why this option is disabled?\n\nA: The reason your Add songs to Library when adding to playlists checkbox is greyed out is because you haven't enabled the iCloud Music Library (see the checkbox above the one that is greyed out).\nIf you enable iCloud Music Library, then you can store your Apple Music songs and playlists in iCloud and access them across all your devices.\nIn summary, by ticking the iCloud Music Library checkbox, the Add songs to Library when adding to playlists checkbox will no longer be greyed out.

How to programmatically find the latest version number of Homebrew?\nI can find this on my local computer with brew --version and string process the result to get a version number. What's a good way to get it for the released Homebrew? I'd like to programmatically verify the homebrew is up-to-date for many computers.\n\nA: I personally do not use Homebrew, so if there is a way using brew itself to get the latest version number available online, I don't know it.\nNote that since Jun 27, 2012 and version 0.9.1 of Homebrew, the version numbering has maintained a set typical pattern of major.minor.maintenance, using only numbers separated by a period. So this is relatively easy to test that values returned from the command substitutions used to assign them to both the installed version and the latest release version variables follow this pattern.\nOnce tested, the version strings are converted to numbers so that a binary comparison can determine if the installed version is less than the latest release version, at which point one can take appropriate action.\nThe following bash script is an example of how one might code it:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n    # Get installed version number and latest release version number.\n\nlocalHomebrewVersion=\"$(brew --version | awk '/Homebrew [0-9]/{print $2}')\"\nlatestHomebrewRelease=\"$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/releases/latest | ruby -rjson -e 'puts JSON.parse($<.read)[\"name\"]')\"\n\n    # Test that both variables hold the expected pattern.\n\nif [[ $localHomebrewVersion =~ [0-9]\\.[0-9]{1,2}\\.[0-9]{1,2} ]] && [[ $latestHomebrewRelease =~ [0-9]\\.[0-9]{1,2}\\.[0-9]{1,2} ]]; then\n\n        # Function used to convert string version numbers to numeric values for testing.\n\n    function version { echo \"$@\" | awk -F. '{ printf(\"%d%03d%03d%03d\", $1,$2,$3,$4); }'; }\n\n        # Test to see if the installed version number is less than the latest release version.\n\n    if [[ $(version $localHomebrewVersion) -lt $(version $latestHomebrewRelease) ]]; then\n        brew update\n    else\n        echo \"Homebrew is already up-to-date.\"\n    fi\n\nelse\n        # One or both of the command substitutions '$(...)' returned unexpected output for the version variables.\n\n    echo \"At least one of the version variables contains an unexpected value.\"\nfi\n\n\nNote: I've incorporated the command suggested in Synoli's comment to assign to the latestHomebrewRelease variable, as it certainly appears to be a more stable method to get the latest release version information.\nUpdate: Added a test to see the version variables contain the expected pattern before testing if the installed version is less than the latest release version.\n", "Q: Command Line Firewall I have decided to add a firewall to my computer and have heard of applications such as 'Little Snitch' which help to give me control of inbound and outbound connections on my mac running macOS Sierra.

The default firewall is also an option, however, I would like to determine the ports myself and preferably the server address that is sending or receiving data from my computer like little snitch allows.To review what I want, Is there an application which would allow me to block ingoing and outbound connections on my mac through the command-line while allowing me to say what ports and addresses are allowed to communicate on my computer? It would also be good if the application is free.\n\nA: There is, and it comes with macOS by default.\nLittle Snitch is an application firewall, that's a whole different story.

My iPhone and iPad show an update and I'd like to know how long this update takes.\nIs this a quick update?\n\nA: The update from iOS 10.2 to iOS 10.3 is a very large update under the hood, so it's not the typical update that is a quick download and quick restart. You'll likely need 10 minutes to check backup and 20-40 for the actual update (excluding download time of the update which depends on server load and network conditions).\nYou won't notice a ton of new features and changes like from iOS 6 to iOS 7, but the entire storage system that holds all your apps, photos, movies and files is changed to a newer filesystem format without losing any of your data. I believe the older devices skip this filesystem reformat (iPhone 5 for example) and they might be faster udpates.\nThe new APFS filesystem for 64 bit iOS hardware runs storage on iOS 10.3 instead of HFS+ which has been Apple's main format on both iOS and macOS for decades.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1893 iOS 10.3 changes\n\nFor most people, I would recommend the following:\n\n*\n\n*If you don't normally update your apps, postpone this upgrade for two or three days. Instead, go to the App Store and apply all updates. If you haven't checked if your backups are good, please go to iCloud settings or connect to iTunes and make sure your backup is complete and recent.\n\n\n*If you do have recent backups and have been updating your apps in the last week, you should plan for 30 minutes to apply this upgrade since it runs a conversion step when the device restarts.\nFor many people, it might be best to schedule the update for the evening when the device is plugged in to power and connected to WiFi. These timing allow 5 minutes to download the installer - that’s the shortest portion of this update.\n\n*\n\n*My iPhone 7 (256 GB) took 28 minutes to update\n\n*My iPad Air 2 (64 GB) took 32 minutes to update\n\n\nA: The reason it will not tell you average time because that varies on connection and wifi or cellular and can take awhile once the download tell you time that can be 30 minutes or less.\nimaging and updating the iOS Device depending how many apps you have and issues with device can be an average of 15-20 minutes and if the phone is from a fresh wipe can be 15 and under minutes.\nJust place you device down and let it do its thing and don't play around with the phone I also change the time out from 2 minutes to never so that there is no interruption to update.\n\nA: i am updating py iphone 5s to ios 10.3.1. i have waited s long time because my favorite app did not work with this update. good part is this only take a max of 15 minutes to update and it frees up more storage!\n", "Q: Replacing a macbook air 2016 I/O Board and Flex Cable I am trying to find a replacement part for my macbook air 2016 (model-A1466) I/O board and flex cable.\nThe cable has a part number printed on it:\n821-1722-A\nC-{4 digits which I can't remember}\nI found a replacement part with the same product number, but the 4 digits on the second line are different. \nDoes that matter or do I need an EXACT match?\n\nA: According to this iFixit product page the part number for this part doesn't seem to include the C-XXXX portion as they only have 821-1722-A listed in the part number. I also find it useful to use their Identify your Mac feature when I'm looking for parts. Good luck!\n\nA: It is always better to know the EMC number of your Mac.\nThe A*** model is only about the kind of MacBook (type of enclosure).\nFor instance, A1278 (13'') and A1286 (15'') MacBook Pro are spread over several years, but there are different EMC numbers depending on the year those Mac were produced.\nApple is specialist is making small changes for the same model, from one year to another. For instance, they may change the length of a cable, or how a connector is oriented (i.e. rotated).\nAs a rule, matching the model number (A1466 in your case) does not ensure finding the right part (especially for flex cables), whilst matching the EMC number does.\nIf you have some doubt about compatibility, you can ask the seller to measure the lenght of the cable, and/or to take additional pictures of the connector. Often, cables with different numbers have similar inner wire structure, but different lenghts.

However, I have those apps as well, but the Mac AppStore does not let me use my account for this machine. Is there an easy way to change this, so that I can update the apps with my account?\n\nA: There isn't an automated way to do that.\nYou would need to request a new redemption code from Apple for all of the apps. I've seen them grant that for businesses that can prove they purchased the Macs. \nFor used Macs, I've generally bought a gift card for the buyer or discounted the selling price to account for the lack of license for the built in apps.\nI suppose you could ask for a \"do-over\" for that Mac to Apple Support if you can't put both accounts in a Family Sharing situation and use the AppleID you want to access \"puchases\" from another account.\n", "Q: Can I block entire area codes from my iPhone? I get 4-5 telemarketer calls each day.  Each time they call, it is from a completely different phone number.  Including different area codes.\nI've performed all of the usual procedures to combat this.\n•  Contacted my carrier (AT&T).  They will block 30 or so numbers for free but then it costs after that.  This is useless because I get 30 different numbers in a week.  AT&T suggested changing my number (for a FEE).\n•  I've changed my number.  It went from bad to worse.  I actually get more on this new number.  I swear I don't put my number out there, I don't sign up for garbage, etc.  \n•  I've tried telling these \"companies\" to remove me from their list.  They immediately hang up on me when I do that.  I've tried calling the numbers, it never goes through.  They are unreachable.  Even AT&T admitted they can't track them.\n•  I've registered for the national \"do not call\" registry.  This hasn't helped at all.\nI'm running out of ideas.  I'd love to just turn my phone off but I can't because of work.\nFor each number I get, I immediately add it to the block numbers.  But this only stops repeat numbers.\nSo, my question is, is there a way in iOS to literally block entire area codes?  I seriously don't care if I block a few legit numbers for the sake of sanity.  I sometimes get telemarketers from my area code but those are more rare.\nI have an iPhone 6 with the latest version if that helps.\n\nA: Yes, there IS a free and easy way to block incoming nuisance calls on an iPhone!\n(1) Get and install a silent ringtone (I use one called \"10 seconds of silence\" which I found on the internet for free).\n(2) You know who your regular callers are. Give each contact a ringtone other than the default. (Yes, it takes a few minutes, but it's a one-time thing.)\n(3) Set your phone's default ringtone to \"10 seconds of silence\".\nFrom then on known callers get cause your phone to ring with whatever ringtone you've assigned that particular caller.\nCalls from unknown callers will not cause your phone to ring. These callers can leave a message if they wish. Most spammers don't bother.\nRepeat nuisance callers can have their numbers added to a special \"Spammers\" contact which you can block so that such callers cannot even leave messages. Just remember that if you do this, you have to unblock and re-block this contact each time you add a number. Don't worry about whether you indicate the number is fax or mobile or whatever--doesn't matter. I used to do this last step, but found it was unnecessary. Plus I kind of like to look once or twice a day and see where the spammers are ostensibly calling from--of course, their really using spoofed numbers using VoIP over the internet.\n\nA: I do not believe iPhone has the ability to block phone numbers based on area code or other such rules.\nHowever, you might consider two options for spam blocking tools. I use both of these, and have no affiliation with either. The first is a free option for iPhone, called Hiya. Hiya uses iOS CallKit framework, that integrates with the phone app to provide additional features, so rest assured that it is not 'hacking' your phone. Hiya has a constantly updating list of spam caller numbers, so you don't have to constantly block all the different numbers. You install and activate Hiya, and when the phone rings, it will show you if it is from a suspected Spam or telemarketer. Then you may just silent the call. You can also configure Hiya to send known spam, and fraud calls, to voicemail, and similar options to those it 'suspects' as spam. You can also enter a number into the Hiya app, which will give you more information, and offer to block the number in the future.\nThe second option is one that costs $1.99 per month for your iPhone, but is free (and highly recommended) for your landline, if you have one. Nomorobo is a similar tool, that on the iPhone uses CallKit as well. It has a very extensive database of spam and fraud numbers, which, like Hiya, it looks up when your phone rings. Nomorobo is free for landlines, and it makes money by selling the service on mobile devices. All very reasonable. It works similarly to Hiya, in that it shows suspected spam or \"robocaller\".  I think Nomorobo works better, but YMMV.\n\nA: In addition to the answer above that you can't block patterns without a third party extension (which you could compile and run yourself with Xcode assuming sufficient skill in programming) there is going to be some sort of change needed by the carriers.\nKeep in mind the spammers are calling every phone number in the book these days. You really need to write a formal letter to your carrier and ask them how to trace / charge back to the people making the calls. The carriers need to fix this and stop making money from the callers that are abusing caller ID features. If the carrier insisted the callers use one traceable number, people could block things.\nAdditionally, it might require legislation to increase penalties of people that don't consult the do not call list. If you could get actionable information about the caller upon formal complaint and then take that company to small claims court in your local community and win $500 or so, that would end this practice quite quickly.\n\nA: Okay guys, here is a trick I just read about in the internetz. Although it's not approved yet, I decided to give it a try because it sounds reasonable.\nI get frequent calls from Guinea (Country Code: +224), so I just added a contact with the respective number +224 and blocked the contact with the default Apple iOS 10.3.3 option (Settings / Phone / Block and identify calls). I also get frequent calls from UK (Country Code: +44). Because I can't block a contact with the number +44, I created a contact with 10 numbers in total (+44 0, +44 1, +44 2, ... +44 9). Same with Austria (Country Code +43).\nThe best part of the solution is that you don't have to rely on third party Apps which are occasionally collecting our data.\nCheers from Germany,\nkeep your head up!\n\nA: Maybe it will help to think of these calls like junk mail? Without junk mail, the price of a stamp would be considerably higher... but yeah, that sucks.\nHere's a review of iOS10 call-blocking apps which recommends the free app, Hiya\n\nHiya does require that users provide access to their contacts, which may deter some people from using the app over concerns about where their information might wind up. The company’s privacy policy is incomplete and a bit unclear about what it does with specific data, including contacts, but a company spokesperson provided extensive and official clarification on request.\nHiya says it uploads a user’s phone number and contact phone numbers to add to its global whitelist, because contacts tend, as it notes, not to be spammers. The app also uses your contact information to help with calls placed within the app, one of its features. The company says it keeps contact data otherwise private, and doesn't sell it to third parties, nor does it use the information to market to your contacts. Hiya also says it doesn’t give your phone number to third parties.\n\nHere's another article with call blocking options. You might be interested in \"Call Bliss\" (not free) to only let known callers through.\n\nIf you're still receiving unwanted solicitations after registering your number with the do not call registry, then you should report the numbers to the FTC.\n\nIf you received an unwanted call after your number was on the National Registry for 31 days, report it to the FTC.\n\nIf you are being called by an actual person, instead of a \"robo-call\" recording, just immediately talk over them and tell them to cease and desist, that the call time and number are being reported to the FTC, and that you will personally sue them and their company if the continue to harass you. They usually hang up before I can get all that out and it seems to do a good job of preventing them from calling back.\nGood luck!\nFrom the Do Not Call Registry FAQ:\n\nWhat are the penalties for breaking the law?\nThose who violate the National Do Not Call Registry or place an illegal robocall can be fined up to $40,654 per call.\n\nAlso:\n\nIf you get unwanted calls from many different numbers, look into a call blocking solution. There are online call blocking services, call blocking boxes, and smartphone apps that block unwanted calls. Research whether the service costs money and whether it’s effective. Do an online search to look for reviews from experts and other users.\n\n", "Q: How can I make a photo album that stays on my iPhone, even when removing all other photos using windows \"import\"?

I have just purchased AirPods. When I'm in my kitchen watching videos from my MacBook Pro paired with AirPods, the audio in the AirPods frequently tend to switch over to low-quality audio for a second. This is discernable because there is a volume spike/panning-style effect. This is probably due to connectivity issues.\nI'm assuming the problem is due to one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Wi-Fi LAN router connection to the MacBook\n\n*The Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connection from the MacBook to the AirPods\n\n\nI don't think that the first point is the main issue because I don't usually experience audio loss when playing video from the MacBook speakers in this room – but it could be. \nMy question is: do AirPods directly benefit from better LAN Wi-Fi? I.e. does the LAN Wi-Fi improve device connectivity for the AirPods, for instance by 'empowering' the user to traverse further to other rooms, than would be possible if there was no LAN Wi-Fi present (like outdoors)?\nIf yes, that may suggest to me that I should upgrade my Wi-Fi router to improve the AirPod experience.\n\nA: In a nutshell - no WiFi doesn't help the AirPods at all.\nProblematic interference on the 2.4 GHz frequency range could hurt bluetooth quality, so I suppose you could power off the WiFi gear and test if that's in any way related to the signal issues you are seeing with AirPods.\n", "Q: How can I append to a file using dd?

I'm assuming its using the group feature, but I can't figure out how to add someone to a group.\nHow can I do that on my iPhone? Is that even possible? \n\nA: In the macOS Contacts app, you can create a new Group by either going into File → New Group or pressing ⇧ shift ⌘ cmd N.\nTo add a contact to that group, simply drag them from the main list to the group in the left side-pane. If that pane is hidden, you may make it visible by going into View → Show Groups or pressing ⌘ cmd 1.\nAs of iOS 10.3, it is not possible to manipulate groups in the iOS Contacts app, only filter by groups.\nYou can perform these operations using the web apps at iCloud.com, although doing so using Safari for iOS is very difficult.\n\nA: iOS\nThis is not presently possible on iOS, but you can do this via the use of third party apps such as Groups.\nmacOS\nThis is possible on macOS.

They've said this on two separate occasions, at different locations, months apart, so I don't think it's just inexperience or operator error from the Verizon representative.\nWhy isn't my iPhone able to be connected to Verizon, and is there a way around it?\nI have read a few other Q&As here that mention that Verizon was a CDMA network, however these were older questions, and some more recent ones suggested that is no longer the case.\n\nA: Unless you have a 6 or later, Verizon voice is CDMA-only for the 5s.\nIf your iPhone 5S is not CDMA capable, data might work on LTE portions of Verizon's network. It would still need to support all of Verizon's LTE bands (see iPhone LTE support). But, as mentioned above, voice would not work.  VoLTE is only supported on the 6 and later. \nVerizon has a database of iPhone IMEIs that are legitimately sold as Verizon \"branded\" or as world-unlocked phones, and that are CDMA capable. If they can't add it, there's a 99% chance it wouldn't work to your satisfaction.\nYou can test whether it would work at all by loading a Verizon SIM from a friend's iPhone 5S or later.  (A SIM from any non-Apple device won't generally work because there is a difference in back end programming, especially for voice + LTE.)\nIn the off chance that it does work on your friend's SIM, the trick is to get customer service or a store rep to load up a dummy IMEI, or the IMEI of a known compatible phone, just to activate the SIM. I've asked them to do this on occasion where I'm setting up an employee's account and don't have the phone present, but need it activated so it will work as soon as the employee reports to my office.\n(For what it's worth, I find that AT&T's lower frequencies in the 800-900MHz range tend to penetrate buildings better than Verizon or T-Mobile's 1900/2100MHz bands, at least in our neck of the woods in Utah. Your 5S isn't going to support the enhanced coverage offered by the 700MHz bands.)\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts for switching desktops between multiple displays not working I have two monitors plugged into my Mackbook pro. I have the\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Display have separate spaces\" setting enabled in Mission Control.\n\n*Keyboard shortcuts \"Switch to Desktop1\" and \"Switch to Desktop2\"\nsetting enabled in Keyboard shortcut settings.\n\n\nBut pressing ^2 does nothing pretty much. I would expect ^2 to focus on my second display windows. Surprisingly, if I add another desktop from Mission Control, that new 'third' desktop becomes Desktop2 and the second display desktop, which was originally Desktop2, becomes Desktop3. After this, ^2 works fine to switch between Desktop1 and Desktop2, both of which are on the same display.\nIs there a keyboard shortcut to focus on the active window of second display?\nIf the above is expected behavior, is there a better way or app of managing multiple displays. Ideally, I would think both displays work as separate desktops, you can focus on a display and then toggle between the windows/apps of that display only.\n(I am on macOS Sierra 10.12.4)\n\nA: 'Displays have separate Spaces' would appear to be the method you do require, but in order for it to work, you must have more Spaces than screens.\nThen your key commands will switch the screen the cursor is currently in to your requested Space.\nDon't rely on the numbers being accurate until you have set up your full set of Spaces & then, in order to then keep the numbering as you intended, make sure 'Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use' is off.\nYou can drag Spaces into the desired order by invoking Mission Control; take the cursor to the top of a screen & the desktop numbers will expand to show a thumbnail of contents. You can then drag them to your required order & they will re-number automatically.\nOne more thing, which often catches people out - Spaces only work as intended if any given app only occupies any one Space. If you try to spread an app to 2 or more Spaces simultaneously, it breaks behaviour.\nThe alternative working method [the one I actually prefer] is to disable 'Displays have separate Spaces', then each 'desktop' becomes a pair of screens, which move together. So you have 2 screens simultaneously showing Desktop 1, then both switch to Desktop 2, etc in tandem - in effect making each Space double-sized. Apps then stay on the screen & the Space they are assigned, so long as you don't disconnect one screen.\n", "Q: How can I run unzip silently in terminal?

Contrary to popular attempts, this problem is NOT SOLVED by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updating DisplayDriver\n\n*Resetting NVRAM or PRAM\n\n*Trying uselessly to killall Dock (in fact, that will tell you that no matching process found in your name)\n\n*Booting in Safe mode\n\n*And there’s no problem in your monitor!\n\n\nHere's the solution (latest, 2020):\nIn System Preferences → Displays → Arrangement tab, you have to drag and drop the exact white bar which represents the dock (not the blue screen) anywhere on the monitor and leave. Problem solved. Then optionally drag it back to wherever you want. This also works for a multi-monitor setup, as is my case below.\n\n\nA: On rare occasions, I have had to go nuclear and clean out specific preference files:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\nOne might argue that you should back it up first.

Until OS X El Capitan, I used Karabiner to swap the colon with the semicolon.\nHowever, at least until now, the Karabiner Element doesn't support a key swap where both of keys are based on the same root key (so for example, swap between delete and backslash works but swap between single-quote and double-quote doesn't).\nIs there any other hacks in Karabiner-Element that enables this swapping, or any other apps or workarounds in macOS that enables you to swap a key that built on the same base key?\n\nA: I just did a test and TextExpander will do exactly what you want.

Per the official site, the 9.7 inch iPad Pro supports 23 LTE bands for a max theoretical bandwidth of 300Mbps.\n..While the 12.7 inch version supports only 20, with a theoretical max of 150Mbps.\n\nWhy is the larger unit restricted in this way?\n\nA: The larger iPad Pro was released before the smaller one, and presumably before the availability of a newer version of the radio used in the smaller iPad. Only an Apple employee could tell you the details of why the choice was made but I'm guessing this is indicative of a wholesale shift by Apple to use the more advanced radios in future products.\nSo to answer your question: the larger model wasn't \"restricted\" - it was released the year before the smaller model and it's likely the part wasn't available when it was being conceptualized and produced.\n", "Q: Mounting a disk image without the \"nodev\" option I need to mount a disk image.

Didn't work.\nSearched and read threads for over an hour so asking here.\nThanks for any help!\nUpdate per request:\n\n\n*\n\n*Old/replaced monitor (Viewsonic) works in either port by itself\n\n*New replacement monitor works in only 1 port either by itself or with the original.\n\n*Original monitor works in only 1 port either by itself or\nwith the replacement.\n\n\nIn other words, both ports work, all monitors work, all cables work, but the replacement monitor is just not recognized in one of the ports (but it is recognized in the other.)\nSPECS\nOriginal Two Monitors that worked\nACER R240HY - using HDMI to Thunderbolt Cable\nViewsonic VA2455 - using HDMI to DVI/Thunderbolt adapter\nReplacement monitor\nACER R240HY - using HDMI to Thunderbolt Cable\n\nA: So you're not connecting them exactly the same. You're using two adapters on the Viewsonic (an HDMI-DVI cable and an HDMI-Mini DisplayPort cable daisy-chained together) and one on the old Acer. Now you're trying to connect two via HDMI-Mini DisplayPort cables.\nI would suggest trying to connect one of your Acer monitors using a normal HDMI cable to the HDMI port on the right side of the MacBook and the other to the left Thunderbolt port using the HDMI-Mini DisplayPort adapter.\n\nA: There were two solutions. One utilized the HDMI port on the opposite side of the laptop with an DVI to HDMI cable. But I wanted to use the same two Thunderbolt ports so I used a DVI to DVI cable and a DVI to Thunderbolt adapter.\n", "Q: Mirroring content/photos between devices — Tripple the iCloud backup? I own an iPhone 7+, an iPad, and most recently a new MacBook Pro…  so I'm starting to look at the more intelligent syncing of content between devices. \nIf I mirror my photos (for example) or other documents between devices through iOS, does that effectively tripple the storage used in iCloud to back up that content, or is there a bit of intelligence to avoid backing up synch'd content multiple times?\n\nA: No, it doesn't.  iCloud is a syncing solution.  That means it will sync everything to all devices signed-in with the same Apple ID.  \nYou can read more about setting up iCloud from this Apple support page.\nThe amount of storage will be same on all your iOS devices.  It might different on macOS because of optimized storage.  It will never be more space (or tripled).\n", "Q: Unable to connect to the internet on my iMac despite being connected to the network For the last several months, I have used wifi to connect to the internet through an unsecured wifi network that my organization controls - had been working fine since last night. Today my iMac shows that I am connected to the proper network same as always but I am unable to connect to the internet in any way (web browsers, ssh, ping, etc.). The Network settings show me as connected and assigned proper IP and DNS numbers. Renewing DHCP Lease doesn't seem to make a difference. Also because this is a large wifi network managed by an organization and not me personally I contacted the administrator to make sure I hadn't been blacklisted (I had not) and also tried spoofing a new MAC address, which also didn't work. I also know that it is not an issue with the router itself as I am typing this from another device right next to my iMac connected to the same access point (several other devices are also connected with no problem).\nI'm unsure if it has any significance but I had been running a bitcoin node for several weeks on the computer and began running a tor relay a few days ago but my internet had been working since configuring the relay. I also tried stopping both services and checking that all processes were gone with ps, which didn't do anything. The output of ifconfig also looks normal to me and my computer seems to be acting normal other than this issue but I'm at a loss for how to continue debugging this problem. Has anyone encountered anything similar or have any suggestions? \nEdit: \nIt is a 2015 5K 27 in iMac running the most updated version of 10.11\n\nA: Below are a number of things you can try (apologies for anything obvious, but I take nothing for granted).\nRestart the iMac\nDoes restarting the iMac do anything? Rebooting can often resolve these types of issues.\nDisable/Enable Wi-Fi\nSimilar to restarting, but without needing to. You can use the Wi-Fi menu to turn Wi-Fi off. Try this for about a minute and then turn it back on. This also often works.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your iMac\n\n*Restart your iMac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. can you now connect to the Wi-Fi network)\n\n*To exit Safe Mode just restart your Mac as normal\n\n\nThe act of booting into Safe Mode will actually perform a number of background tasks, and this often resolves issues when you've rebooted normally.\nOnce you've tried the above let me know how you go.\n[EDIT]\nOkay, let's continue troubleshooting...\nRun Wireless Diagnostics\nYou can use Wireless Diagnostics to analyse your Wi-Fi network. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close any apps you have running\n\n*Connect to the Wi-Fi network\n\n*Hold down the option key and go to the Wi-Fi status menu and select Open Wireless Diagnostics\n\n*Enter your administrator name and password\n\n\nNow follow the steps to see whether any problems are found.\nTry another 'Wi-Fi' network\nIt'd be interesting to see whether your iMac can get internet connectivity from another Wi-Fi network. Can you share an internet connection from an iPhone's cellular connection (or similar) and connect to that via your iMac's Wi-Fi port? Does this allow your iMac to browse the web, send/receive emails, etc?\nIf you can't get an internet connection, then I'd be testing your hardware, although it may be worth first resetting the NVRAM and SMC (in that order). See below for steps.\nReset NVRAM\nYour iMac uses Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) to store many of its settings. You can reset this with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your iMac. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your iMac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your iMac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nNow proceed to resetting the SMC.\nReset the SMC\nYour iMac has a System Management Controller. It may be worth you resetting this too:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your iMac\n\n*Unplug it from power\n\n*Wait 15 seconds\n\n*Plug the power cord back in\n\n*Wait for an additional 5 seconds\n\n*Press the power button to turn it back on\n\n\nHow does your iMac go with connecting now?\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nIf all else has failed, follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your iMac\n\n*Restart your iMac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n", "Q: How can I send same email multiple times in iOS? I wanted to send a single email to different users. I save an email to drafts and send the email to a user and it goes to the sent box instead of staying in the drafts box. Is there a way I can send an email repeatedly from the drafts box?\n\nA: A good way to achieve this using just the builtin apps on iOS is to save your email as a Note in the Notes app. You can then Share it by Mail, and it will be formatted for you automatically, with the first line becoming the subject of your email.\nYou could even setup a Notes folder with a whole set of email templates that way.\nYour question pertains to iOS and iPad, but in macOS you may also select a previously sent email, then go into the menu bar and click Message → Send Again or Redirect. These commands are also available through right-click.\nOf course the Notes solution still applies in macOS.\n\nA: I have used the \"Mail Aide\" app from the apple store,which was easy for saving the draft and sending the same mail multiple times.But theres was some downside with how the attachments are made available for the mail(the old traditional way of long pressing the attachment).\n\nA: Sending a message will automatically move it out of your drafts. However, you can use the 'Send again' or 'Forward' options on messages in the 'sent' folder, to send the same message again.\n", "Q: Replace Hard Drive in iMac with Fusion We have a Late 2012 iMac in the shop that needs the 3TB hard drive replaced. Turns out this model has a Fusion drive with an SSD that is on the backside of the logic board.\nThe drive has been swapped (new WD Blue 3TB), but we are having issues getting the Fusion setup, and getting OS Sierra loaded. I have tried researching the Fusion drive and what needs to be done, but all I can find is people trying to replace the HDD with an SSD, and other \"projects\".\nWhen we go to Disk Utility from a Sierra flash drive, it does not give me any options to rebuild the Fusion drive or anything like that. If I plug up the original HDD to another Mac, it does tell me it needs to rebuild it, so that confirms it is a Fusion drive.\nHow do we properly replace the HDD, and either get the system booting as-is (is the OS on the SSD?), or reload OS Sierra on it? We are currently working on doing a TimeMachine backup on the system, but it is about 2.2TB of data...\n\nA: A Fusion Drive is a composite of two physical drives: a fast but small SSD and a slower but larger HDD. Each of the physical drives contains three partitions: an EFI partition, a so-called physical volume and a special volume. The special volume on the HDD usually is the Recovery HD.\nThe two physical volumes are part of a Logical Volume Group. Creating a default Fusion Drive means building one Logical Volume in the LVG spanning both physical volumes. The Logical Volume is the one mounted to root (and if enabled - the volume visible on the desktop).\nA file stored on the Logical Volume may reside on the SSD as well as on the HDD. System files may also reside on both drives. Usually an algorithm ensures that system files are stored on the faster SSD but there is no guarantee.\nRemoving one of the physical drives means removing one of the physical volumes and therefore tearing the LVG as well as the LV apart. After destroying the LVG/LV the file system as well as system files or other files are corrupted and the remnants won't be bootable.\n\nTo replace either of the drives, backup your exisiting volume(s) first with Time Machine. Then check whether you can boot to Internet Recovery Mode or create a bootable thumb drive and also try to boot to it.\nShutdown your Mac and replace one (or both) of the old drives. Then boot to Internet Recovery Mode or the bootable thumb drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility and completely erase both disks (each to one volume/GPT/Journaled HFS and assign names e.g. \"fusion1\" and \"fusion2\" but not \"Macintosh HD\"). Don't erase your thumb drive or a drive visible called Boot OS X\n\n*Open Terminal in the menubar Utilities > Terminal and get the device identifiers of the two hard drives by entering diskutil list. Booted to Internet Recovery Mode you will get a list of 14-16 drives - only two of them are your hard drives. Simply check the sizes. The drives related to Internet Recovery Mode have a size of 1.2 GB or smaller!\n\n*Create a new LVG and LV (here I assume the 120 GB SSD has the disk identifier disk0 and the 3 TB HDD disk1 - they might be different though!):\ndiskutil cs create Fusion disk0 disk1\ndiskutil cs createVolume lvgUUID jhfs+ \"Macintosh HD\" 100% #replace lvgUUID with the UUID shown in the output of the previous command\n\n\n*verify the Fusion Drive with:\ndiskutil verifyDisk disk0 # use one of the disk identifiers found previously \n\n\n*Enter exit to quit Terminal.app\n\n*attach the Time Machine backup drive and in the Utilities windows choose Restore from Time Machine Backup > Select backup source > ...choose the drive and restore it to your Macintosh HD volume.\n\n*After the restore task has finished successfully, boot your Mac normally. Check if a RecoveryHD is present by opening Terminal and entering diskutil list.\n\n*When the RecoveryHD is missing, simply reinstall Sierra with the latest Sierra installer downloaded from the App Store  - which shouldn't affect your data but creates an additional RecoveryHD - or use the Recovery Partition Creator 4.\n\n", "Q: SSH no longer works after update to 10.12.4 I've been successfully using the following script to initiate port forwarding for the last year or so:\nssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nssh -f admin@ssh.mydomain.com -L 50003:inst3:3389 -N -p 33233\nssh -f admin@ssh.mydomain.com -L 50005:inst5:3389 -N -p 33233\nssh -f admin@ssh.mydomain.com -L 50006:inst6:3389 -N -p 33233\n\nImmediately after running today's OS update to 10.12.4, running this same script generates the following error:\nUnable to negotiate with [my routable IP] port 33233: no matching host key type found.

Forgive for the question if I can't.\n\nA: In System Preferences/Keyboard, you just set the \"Touch Bar Shows\" drop-down in the Keyboard tab to \"Expanded Control Strip\", and use the Customize Control Strip button to set up that expanded control strip however you want.\n\nA: I believe you're referring to a customized view you made on one app applying to all your apps. If not, skip this section.\nThe touch bar is configured separately for every view you are in within each app (so there are multiple configurations within the same app such as composing and reading mail or example) but there are also system settings for the 4 icons that always show up on the right of the touch bar and the icons that show up when you click the arrow next to those.

Every previous attachment still looks like <PastedGraphic-14.png>. Is there anyway to forward an email including all the actual images?\n\nA: Mail does not have the ability to search through an email thread and automatically reinsert stripped photos in-place. Doing so would likely result in emails too large to either send or receive (not to mention the amount of development effort involved in implementing such logic).\nYour options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go and find every “missing” photo yourself, save them to your desktop (macOS) or camera roll (iOS) then manually attach them all to your forwarded email.\n\n*Select each individual email that contains photos, then click Message → Forward as Attachment from the menu bar (also available from the right-click menu).

If you are lucky, you can do that on the homepage of your provider. It will probably cost a fee, and there will be far higher charges for calls and texts. Internet may be very limited.\nMy advice: Get a phone with 2 sim cards. One for local calls, the other one so you can be reached under your old phone number. That way, you get the best of both worlds.\nI also suggest not to take calls of people who call you, but to call them back with your new sim, as this will save you the roaming fees - check how high they are, maybe it's not necessary to do that.\n", "Q: Is there a way to send Apple proposals for usability improvements?

I recently updated to iOS 10.3 (14E5260b) and noticed one of the new features was a way for developers to request reviews from inside an app.\n\nSome App Store changes are coming in iOS 10.3, allowing developers to respond to customer reviews for the first time. iOS users are also able to label reviews in the App Store as \"Helpful\" or \"Not Helpful\" for surfacing more relevant review content, and Apple plans to limit the number of times developers can ask for a review.

Working nicely on my MacBook now, I now have a  button on my Touch Bar, which types the  symbol. \nInstructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the app Automator, create a new Quick Action. Save the new Quick Action using a name consisting of the symbol it will represent e.g. I named mine \"\". (Optional: At the top of the Quick Action window you can also choose an image which will appear in front of it on the Touch Bar, I chose the plus symbol. If you don't want one you could create a blank image and use that).\n\n*In Automator, find the 'Run Applescript' action (search for it or look under Utilities) and drag it into the script area on the right.\n\n*Paste the following script into it, replacing the \"thumbs up\" symbol with your desired character. \n    set the clipboard to \"\"\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down\n\n\n\n*Save the new Quick Action you have created.\n\n*Go to System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Keyboard and either: a) set \"Touch Bar shows: Quick Actions\" (this will make the new icon appear on the touch bar immediately), or b) use Customise Touch Bar to add the Quick Actions icon to the touch bar (this will make the new icon appear on the touch bar when you press the Quick Actions icon).\n\n*Icon should appear on Touch Bar.

Depending on what view you’re on (i.e. composing vs reading email) on which app (mail vs safari) there is typically an option to \"customize touch bar\" in the menu on the top left of your screen that will be specific to that view.\nCustomize allows you to pick certain things you can add to your touch bar. Emojis are available in Mail and Safari (in addition to messages).\n\"Customize control strip\" (in System Preferences) lets you edit the 4 slots that are always present on the right of the touch bar in addition to the view of the whole touch bar when you click the expansion arrow. These interact with the computer directly, not the app that you are using.\nUpdate: Chrome now supports touch bar! Still no emoji button on the Mac or chrome strip...hopefully it will arrive soon.\n\nMac Emoji Keyboard Shortcut: ctrl + cmd + space\n\nA: Chrome Canary (in Beta) adds support to the Touchbar, but I don't believe it's possible to set the bar to emojis.\n\nA: Bettertouchtool is a great (but not free) tool which allow a hyper-granulated config of all aspects of touch bar, including different setups for different apps.

This is not a good idea, but you asked for it and that's what you get. If you wanted just a finite number of times, you could add # times after repeat. Ex: repeat 3 times. There are many other methodologies to repeat beyond this answer.\nThen you are going to create a tell block and activate the application you are sending these commands to. If you do not do this, you will be sending keystrokes willy nilly to whatever happens to be the active application at the time.\nYou will then do a series of having the \"System Events\" application emulate a keystroke and delaying for a count. delay accepts decimals as well as integers for number of seconds. Note that for the Right Arrow and Escape I used key code 124 and key code 53 respectively. The list of key codes can be found in various locations online with a Google search for 'applescript key codes'. Here is a current one at the time this answer was written: http://eastmanreference.com/complete-list-of-applescript-key-codes/\nFinally, you will end the tell block, no longer sending AppleScript to \"TextEdit\" and then you will end your repeat block.\n\nA: Without the whole script (and the context behind this) it's a bit hard to be sure about an answer - especially an efficient one.\nNevertheless, below is something that may help (although I'm not in front of a computer right now that I can test it with):\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke (key code 124) -- right\ndelay 2\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"1\"\ndelay 2\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\"\ndelay 2\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"cool!\"\ndelay 2\n-- simulate pressing the Return/Enter key\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke (key code 36)\ndelay 2\n-- simulate pressing the ESC key\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke (key code 53)\ndelay 2\n\nNow, depending on you overall script you may not need all the tell application \"System Events\" to lines.\nAlso, every key has a character, an ASCII code, a hexadecimal code and a decimal code. I've tried to comment the above script to explain what the key codes equate to (e.g. key code 53 refers to the decimal code for the ESC key).\nLet me know how you go.\n", "Q: AirPods choppy/unreliable when connected to Mac, but not iPhone Problem\nIn my apartment, when using the AirPods with my Mac, the audio is significantly choppy, fluttery and unreliable. There are frequently small \"pops\" when listening to music. The issue is not present when using the AirPods with my iPhone.\nThe Apple Stack Exchange question you are reading now, is actually an update to my question on the same topic that was posted and resolved here previously. I had this very same issue while on macOS Sierra 10.12.4. We found out that the culprit was a bug introduced in that particular macOS version, and the problem went away with 10.12.5.\nI am now on 10.12.6 and having a quite identical problem. But I'm not confident that the OS is at fault this time.\nThe reason is that I recently swapped my AirPods for a new pair, via an unrelated Apple support ticket. The new ones arrived via mail and I was instructed to pair them with my original case.\nThe new pair of AirPods seem significantly more prone to skipping, stuttering and losing connection. I did not have this problem with my original AirPods, which I also used with 10.12.6 without problems (at least that I am cognizant of).\nPossible explanation\nI think I have found what's causing the skipping (albeit not the root cause), and it seems to be my iPhone Bluetooth signalling with its environment. Whenever that happens, there is a glitch/pop on the Mac ←→ AirPod connection. When I disable Bluetooth on the iPhone, the problems go away.\nI haven't changed anything in my environment except swapping the AirPods. No microwave in the background etc.\nI am quite confident that the reason is Bluetooth interaction from the iPhone. I am just not sure how to proceed, because the weird thing is that the problems started just when I replaced the AirPods for a new pair.\nSome plausible root causes are:\n\n*\n\n*The new AirPods are in fact defect or come from a batch that are not as 'good' with Bluetooth.\n\n*macOS 10.12.6 introduced a bug similar to the one in macOS 10.12.4, but I didn't realize it until much later (not that likely IMO, knowing how sensitive I am to audio quality).\n\n*The pairing process whereby new AirPod buds were paired with an original case didn't go exactly right, and there is a firmware or software problem somewhere.\n\nWhat I have tried\n\n*\n\n*'Hard Reset' of the AirPods according to these instructions;\n\n*Resetting the iPhone Network Settings after \"Forgetting this device\" (the AirPods) as part of the AirPod 'Hard Reset'.\n\n*Resetting the Mac Bluetooth Module according to these instructions.\n\n\nA: If all else fails you can reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller.

However, if I just change the audio input to the internal microphone, the Bluetooth connection only delivers sound output, so I think it can handle higher quality audio. On the other hand, if I use both microphone & speaker on a Bluetooth 4.0 device, I think the connection degrades and sacrifices audio output bandwidth in order to make room for delivering audio input.\nIndeed, according to some sources, Bluetooth 4.2 is 250% faster and has 10x more capacity\nReference:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-differences-between-Bluetooth-4-0-4-1-and-4-2-in-the-Layers-Baseband-LMP-L2CAP-app-Layer\n\n*https://www.semiconductorstore.com/blog/2015/BLE-4-2-vs-BLE-4-1/1548/\n\nA: This appears to be a new audio driver bug introduced in macOS Sierra 10.12.4.

The Dropbox widget notifies me when files have been changed, and it is syncing those changes.\nFrequently throughout the day (3-4 times, as far as I can tell), the Dropbox widget indicates that it is syncing a bunch of files that, I think, are part of the Photos library, like this:\n\nI think they have something to do with the database that the Photos app keeps to organize the library. This occurs despite not having the Photos app open, and not intentionally doing anything related to the Photos library!\nIs there some kind of background process that is accessing or modifying my Photos library? I tried shutting off iCloud on my laptop, but it had no effect on the problem.\nThis is irritating, because neither my computer nor my internet connection is very fast, so it slows my work down.\nThanks for your help!\n*Note: I am aware of the hazards of using Dropbox to sync a Photos library. I only access it on one computer.\n\nA: This is the design of iCloud based photo library storage. There are several daemons that run in the background so you'll want to store your these files in a directory where dropbox doesn't perform any syncronizioaion. \nIf you need backup, you can script that and store just the periodic backups in dropbox. \nYou likely won't be able to change this behavior as Apple is all in with cloud syncing of data and even if you neutered the processes on this version of 10.12, the next security update or patch will likely re-enable this behavior.\nIf you really need to track down what's happening, you can open the command line (terminal.app) and use fs_usage to see in real time which processes access the files in question. With sudden app termination and power nap, you may find that the system will start processes to run periodically even when the app itself isn't launched. Similarly, when an app is launched, the process can and will be terminated when the system knows they have no work to do.\nThe analogy isn't perfect, but several years back, most apps were a manual transmission. Now most Apple apps are automatic transmission - you don't control their launch or exit in many cases - just whether the icon shows in the app switcher and dock.\n", "Q: Pages cost money now?

This includes when the MacBook boots up or wakes.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook outputs intermittent signal to external monitors via Thunderbolt interface leading to race condition like situation where the external monitor wakes from power-save mode upon receiving a signal from the MacBook, but goes back into power-save mode due to not detecting a signal (or at least a consistent one) by the time it has finished waking. This process repeats cyclicly for some time until both external monitors happen to get in sync with the MacBook (or they don't, see below).\n\n*The MacBook enters an unresponsive state after being in the above cycle for some time without the external monitors getting in sync with the MacBook. This requires a forced shut down which can lead to loss of data and unsaved work.\n\n\nPlease see my answer below for further details.\n\nA: The following paragraph is meant as a high level summary of the issue that is occurring, and I attempt to explain the relevant parts in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\nImmediately after upgrading from macOS 10.12.3 to 10.12.4 I noticed that when my MacBook Pro (Late 2013) boots up or wakes while plugged into my two external displays via Mini DisplayPort, my MacBook has extreme difficulty getting them both working at the same time. The MacBook's screen will turn on and off as it tries to get in sync with the external displays (to start displaying on them as normal). Meanwhile, the displays seem to cycle between receiving a signal and receiving no signal as suggested by the fact that the displays will wake, but then display \"No Signal\" and go back into power-save mode. Eventually, after many cycles of this, one or both displays may \"get in sync\" with the MacBook and function normally from there on out. But sometimes it goes through many such cycles without getting in sync. When the displays and the MacBook fail to get in sync after many cycles and continue to cycle as described, I may unplug one or both external monitors and try to get them to sync up individually, which is usually easier than trying both at once. This makes sense because, as I explain below, this problem is effectively a race condition and appears to be compounded with every additional external display in use. Finally, the more serious case is when the cycle I've described ends in the MacBook entering an unresponsive state and requiring a forced shutdown which can lead to loss of data or unsaved work. Furthermore, this whole issue presents itself every time I boot up or wake the MacBook.\nTo be clear, the displays wake from power-save mode upon receiving a signal from my MacBook (e.g. when it boots or wakes from sleep). But after receiving that initial signal waking the display from power-save mode, the display shows \"No Signal\" and goes back into power-save mode. Meanwhile, the display on my MacBook goes from normal to a blank screen for a couple seconds and back to normal as it seemingly switches between outputting to the external display and not outputting. This is the cycle that continuously repeats until either each respective monitor gets in sync with the MacBook and works as normal, or the MacBook enters an unresponsive state as described below. In the case where the monitors do eventually get in sync, it appears to occur the moment the monitor waking happens to coincide with the MacBook outputting a consistent signal to that respective monitor. So, it's effectively a race condition. The reason I say the MacBook cycles between outputting to the monitor and not outputting to it is because, while it's in this cycle, I'll observe windows I had open on the external monitor prior to the MacBook sleeping toggle between being displayed on the MacBook's display and not being displayed at all (presumably they're being output to the external display).\nAs I mentioned above, there is an even more troublesome situation I've now encountered multiple times where, upon waking from sleep, the MacBook will enter the cycle of trying to get in sync with the monitors for a while and then enter an unresponsive state, showing a blank screen. Plugging in and unplugging the monitors from the MacBook or power cycling the monitors seems to have no effect in this situation. Even if the MacBook is recognizing one of the monitors while in this unresponsive state, that monitor is also just rendering a blank screen (but is not going into sleep mode therefore is receiving a signal). My only option has been to force shut down my MacBook after this has happened by pressing the power button and leaving it pressed.\nI have two Acer S241HL displays each connected via Mini DisplayPort. I had never had this issue before and it started immediately after I upgraded from 10.12.3 to 10.12.4. In the past, my MacBook's screen might turn on/off once or twice when booting up (and maybe waking?) before all displays were on and rendering properly. But that was always quick and never an issue. This is a much greater extreme and a major inconvenience as I have to wait and sometimes mess with the monitors every time my MacBook wakes or boots up. Even more serious is that it is now dangerous for me to wake my MacBook if I have monitors plugged in due to the risk of it entering an unresponsive state, thus requiring a forced shut down. This can easily cause problems including loss of data and unsaved work.\nI've contacted Apple Support to escalate this issue to engineering. They should be aware of this thread, so if you experience this same issue, please comment with details of your setup such as which video out port(s) you're using and what kinds of cables/adapters, as well as any other pertinent information.\n\nA: Let Apple Know\nIf you have a reproducible test case (preferably after isolating for extraneous variables like sleep / wake / third party extensions and on a cleanly installed OS), the best way to alert engineering at Apple is via their Bug Reporter.

If you're convinced it's the update, install a clean OS (same version) on external drive and test that for a few hours. That sort of detail usually gets Apple Engineering involved if you can reproduce the issue with a clean install.\nDon't overlook cables as well - we're replacing a whole lot more cables than we did in past years. It's too soon to tell if we just bought lesser quality cables or if the new hardware and drivers are just more picky. The good news is cables are relatively cheap and you can mark the suspect ones for reuse later if it turns out to be software and not the cables.\n\nA: I am seeing something like this with an Acer monitor (H233H) on a direct HDMI connection from a late 2013 MacBook Pro on 10.14.6.\nI'm not getting the crashes, but I do see a race condition here, to me it looks like:\n\n\n*\n\n*The monitor starts up, and pokes the HDMI connection\n\n*The MacBook sees this and starts up dual screen mode\n\n*...\n\n*The MacBook still hasn't returned anything on the HDMI interface, so the monitor gives up and shows \"no signal\"\n\n*The MacBook finishes switching modes, and starts sending a signal\n\n*But the monitor isn't listening any more\n\n*Power cycling the monitor will break the HDMI connection and return the MacBook to single-screen mode (ie. goto step 1)\n\n\nI've found that sometimes the monitor can restart fast enough to avoid triggering this last step, but apart from that I haven't figured out any way around this.\n", "Q: How can i turn mobile data on without going into the settings?

Now, I’ve no particular reason to distrust them, but until a minute ago I had no idea that my computer trusted them. More concerningly, I wouldn’t really know if that certificate came built into [the OS] or just got added last week by a nasty bit of malware…  \n\n\nIs this normal? How should I deal with such a thing?\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the certificate? (Is this even possible with S.I.P.?)  \n\n*\"Untrust\" the certificate?  \n\n*Is there a way to neutralize all the certificates which weren't there\nwhen the OS was first installed? (is this even a good idea?)  \n\n\n\nOf note, there are a handful of other oddly named (therefore suspicious looking to me) certificates in my Keychain Access. Per the comments to this similar question I am reticent to just start deleting/disabling certificates without a better understanding of what I am doing, how to undo any damage I might cause by deleting certificates which look suspicious or a better understanding of the security issues.  \nApologies if this is too broad a question, but what is the Turkish government doing on my computer and should I get rid of the embassy they've installed in my computer?  \nI am particularly leery, as apparently there is a \"Turkish Crime Family\" making threats about Apple accounts which they are claiming will happen this April 7, 2017.  \nFWIW: macOS Sierra 10.12.4, mid-2012 MacBook Air  \n\nA: Per this list of \"trusted root certificates in iOS 9\" from Apple it seems this is just one of many of the trusted root authorities around the globe. While this is for iOS and not macOS, which you're asking about, I'd assume Apple would keep parity on these OS's.\nIf you were to untrust them I'd imagine some part of the internet (however small) may stop validating SSL certs on your machine.\nEdit: Here's another list specific to macOS, straight from Apple.\n", "Q: Is there any time limit in the List view of the iPhone Calendar app? Is there any time limit in the List view of the iPhone Calendar app, beyond which we cannot make any entries? Can this limit be changed to something else than the 2 years set by by Apple?\n\nA: There is no limit in the Calendar itself – you can 'zoom out' by repeatedly tapping the Back button until you're in a screen where each year takes up about a single page. Scroll down to e.g. 2027, and you can create an event in the distant future without problems:\n \nThe List view does seem to have a built-in limit of two years, which can't be extended by settings.\n\nA: To add to the same \"List view not displaying beyond 2 years\". Calendar allowed me to enter an event beyond 2 years, but it will not find it if I search. The search takes me to the last week of 2 years.\nI've switched to ToDo Pro for \"far out\" tasks.\nTony\n", "Q: How to migrate email database from Outlook for Mac 2015 to Windows Outlook? Recently I found out that there is no option available in order to move your Outlook for mac email database to windows outlook. It a permanent flaw that windows have never worked on. And users like me are deeply suffering from such ignorance. I am here to present my problem of migration and find a suitable and quick solution for this migration issue.\nLooking forward for some valuable solutions. Thanks\n\nA: You are absolutely right that there is no way back to switch from Outlook mac to Windows Manually as outlook mac exports its database as .olm files which cannot be imported into Windows Outlook. \nIf your email id is Imap enabled then you can directly login to windows outlook and within few minutes your emails will start downloading.\nThere are many applications available that help in transferring the outlook mac data to windows outlook. You can go for these only if your email database is large. Here is one I found that had some decent features: http://www.olmtopstconverterultimate.com/\nPlease note that these applications are paid. Give the trial version a thorough run g=before purchasing the complete license.\nThanks.

For example, Apple Pay is just beginning to work in Taiwan. \n\n\n*\n\n*But can it work if I set up Apply Pay using a USA credit card?\n\n*Will there be any foreign transaction fee (of 3% by the credit card)\n\n*Same as (2) but what if it is a credit card like Capital One that doesn't have any foreign transaction fee when you use the physical card?\n\n\nA: Yes. Assuming the card you linked to Apple Pay allows foreign transactions. \nOnce setup you can use an Apple Pay-linked credit card in any country with a contactless payment terminal when they accept your credit card. Your linked card will be charged in the currency of the vendor where you use Apple Pay and you may incur foreign transaction fees on the transactions.\nConsult your card holder agreement to determine if your card functions outside of the country of issuance and whether foreign transaction fees will be charged.\nApple Pay is a means of presenting a credit card to complete a transaction. It doesn't replace the credit card and your credit agreement with the card issuing bank. All of that still applies when you use Apple Pay.\n", "Q: Is the memory reported in Activity Monitor accurate? I've been relying on activity monitor to check my performance problems and what it relates to. I recently installed CleanMyMac and noticed that the memory reported by it is way different than the activity monitor:\n\nAm I calculating the memory wrong? Or there is something I'm not accounting for? I expect to have 4.00 - 2.91 = 1.09 GB of free memory, instead CleanMyMac reports only 27.5 free memory. Is there anything I am not considering in Activity Monitor?\n\nA: You are doing the calculations wrong. In the column you see: physical memory, memory used, cached files, and swap used.\nPhysical memory is total RAM. Memory used is amount of RAM used for running processes. Cached files is the amount of RAM used for storing cache files, and swap used is the amount of disk (HDD/SSD) space that is being used as though it is RAM. So the calculation should be: Physical memory - (memory used + cached files). In your case: 4 GB - (2.91 + 1.07) (give or take).\nHowever, what's really important is memory pressure. The system is good about using the RAM wisely. Your performance shouldn't be impeded as long as the memory pressure stays in the green.\n", "Q: External HDs spontaneously unmount themselves, now one won't remount I have a short stack of WD bus-powered external drives connected to my mid-2010 17\" MBP through a 10-port powered hub. (According to specs, the hub supplies more than enough amperage to power all of them at once, but I've never actually tested the amperage.) \nOver the last six months or so, I have seen irregularly recurring episodes of one or more of these drives spontaneously ejecting (not clean unmounts, but simply disconnecting). Usually, I've been able to trace the problem to the hub's power brick getting stepped on by a cat. (For some unfathomable reason, companies keep making wall warts that are not fully supported against the wall or the power strip, so that pressure on the end of the brick opposite the plug end pulls the plug out partially. Bad, bad design.)\nSometimes, though, there's no apparent cause for the disconnect. In these cases, most of the time the vanished drive will remount itself without intervention. Every so often, I'll have to unplug and replug the affected drive to get it to remount.\nToday, one of these drives did the unmount trick and wouldn't remount. I've tried rebooting. I've tried plugging it directly into the MBP. I've read several questions and answers here that seem related, and tried the solutions that seemed applicable. Still no mount.\nDisk Utility.app sees the drive, but cannot do anything with it. The volume name does not show up in the list. If I try Repair, it churns for a moment and then reports either \"Couldn't mount disk\" or \"A disk with a mount point is required\".\nTerminal can see the disk also. Prior to reboot, ls -@aehlFGO (my aliased custom ls options) of /Volumes showed the volume name, but with way wrong permissions:\nd--x--x--x+  2 root    admin  -       102B Mar 29 00:20 Raptor/\n 0: group:everyone inherited deny add_file,add_subdirectory,directory_inherit\n\nMy other external drives show correct permissions of drwxrwxr-x@ with owner/group of either me/staff or root/wheel, with no ACL. Since reboot, of course, the affected drive is not listed in /Volumes at all.\ndiskutil list shows the affected drive as disk6. Everything there appears normal, except that there's no volume name:\n/dev/disk6\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk6\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk6s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS                         999.8 GB   disk6s2\n\nPer advice given in another question, I ran sudo gpt -r show disk6 and got the following output (which I don't quite know how to interpret):\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34           6         \n          40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n      409640  1952786352      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  1953195992      262151         \n  1953458143          32         Sec GPT table\n  1953458175           1         Sec GPT header\n\nRunning the same command on one of the other external drives of the same capacity produced identical output, so I'm guessing that this means the partition table is normal.\nTrying the suggestions from another answer got me nowhere:\nWed 2017-03-29 04:37:54 PM qpanda in ~ -bash 4.4.5\n$ diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk6\nOne or more volume(s) failed to mount\nWed 2017-03-29 04:46:35 PM qpanda in ~ -bash 4.4.5\n$ diskutil mountDisk readOnly /dev/disk6\nOne or more volume(s) failed to mount\nWed 2017-03-29 04:47:21 PM qpanda in ~ -bash 4.4.5\n$ diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk6s1\nOne or more volume(s) failed to mount\nWed 2017-03-29 04:48:41 PM qpanda in ~ -bash 4.4.5\n$ diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk6s2\nOne or more volume(s) failed to mount\nWed 2017-03-29 04:49:16 PM qpanda in ~ -bash 4.4.5\n$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6\nUnmount of disk6 failed: at least one volume could not be unmounted\nWed 2017-03-29 04:55:22 PM qpanda in ~ -bash 4.4.5\n$ diskutil unmountDisk force /dev/disk6\nForced unmount of disk6 failed: at least one volume could not be unmounted\nWed 2017-03-29 04:57:01 PM qpanda in ~ -bash 4.4.5\n$ diskutil eject /dev/disk6\nVolume timed out while waiting to eject\nWed 2017-03-29 04:57:48 PM qpanda in ~ -bash 4.4.5\n$ diskutil eject force /dev/disk6\nUnable to find disk for force\n\nSo now I'm not sure what to do. The drive spins when I plug it in, and the activity light shines normally, but nothing I have seems able to do anything at all with the drive except get a small amount of basic info from it.\nI keep this drive backed up on Time Machine, and there's a current backup from shortly before the unmount, so I'm not overly concerned about data loss. My question is whether there's any point in continuing to try to access this drive so I can reformat it and restore the data, or should I just go ahead and replace it? \nI'm not sure if this drive is still under warranty, but I'm going to check that with WD later tonight (all my WD drives are actively registered, thankfully). Whether it is or not, though, replacing the drive means either spending too much money (either for a local in-store purchase or for overnight shipping on an online purchase) or being without it for a few days. Since this drive's contents are all personal use, not business, it's not an expense I can write off. So if it's reasonably possible to get this drive working, even just in the short term, that would be my preference.\nSo, do I have any hope of salvaging this drive? Or should I just give it the Viking funeral?\n\nA: My drive is functioning again!\nI had to reboot into Safe Mode with the drive unplugged, and then plug it in after login, to get diskutil to allow me to do anything to the disk. The volume appeared to mount correctly, but I wanted to run a check on the disk itself (not just the volume) to be sure. This was the returned error:\nThu 2017-03-30 07:03:48 PM qpanda in ~ -bash 4.4.5\n$ diskutil repairDisk disk7\nRepairing the partition map might erase disk7s1, proceed?

Time Machine is now repopulating the drive from the backup, which I expect to take a while (800 GB doesn't copy in an instant).\nI checked my records, and of course, of the three of these drives I'm currently using, this is the only one that's out of warranty. Figures. So I'll be looking for a good deal on a replacement. It was starting to get crowded anyway. \nSo, my problem is solved for now. I think the Safe Boot was the key thing that allowed me to get it working again. Time to check my third-party kexts and daemons again to see if one of them was interfering.\n", "Q: Siri thinks the city on my Facebook is one of my home addresses When I want to use Siri involving my home address, such as navigate home or remind me something when I get home, it always asks me to clarify \"which home address?\" It gives one option that is the home address I put in my contact card in Contacts (it lists the street name and number), and it has another home address (it doesn't list anything, but I believe it's referring to an address that it imported from being connected to Facebook, and that address just has the city (not the street).\nI don't want Siri to think that the Facebook entry is something to ask me about every time. What can I do to fix this? I'd rather not erase the city I have in Facebook. And I'd rather not erase the home address I have on the phone and put my full home address in Facebook. Seems like a basic thing.\n\nA: I figured this out, more or less. On iOS 10 on my contacts card, I was able to edit the identification my phone gives the Facebook address by scrolling down to the connected accounts section of my contact card and editing the Facebook content there. However there is a bug and even after I'm done editing the only options are \"edit\" and \"cancel\" but not something to save it.\nSo instead I went to macOS, opened my contacts card there, edit my information there more easily, and it sync'ed to my iPhone, so Siri works properly now.\n", "Q: How do i send a message from my MacBook Air to a Non-iPhone user? How do I send a message from my MacBook Air to a Non-iPhone user?\nI want to text my friends from my laptop (Apple) and I can't.

The screenshot below shows a rather normal listening volume. If I double it, it's very loud, but it's still at only 20% or less.\nAnything over that, it sounds like the speakers are broken.\nIs anyone else having this issue? The problem it causes is that I don't have fine control over the volume, for example when using the volume keys up or down, it moves in too big steps.\nIs there a way to \"rescale\" the volume slider, or cap it at a maximum value somehow, so I can use the entire slider without becoming deaf?\n\n\nA: You can make fine adjustments to your volume level by holding OptionShift while you press F11 F12 (Volume Up/Down).  this way, it won't make those big jumps.\nAs for the cause of the volume issue - it appears you aren't alone as evidenced by this Apple discussion thread and this thread.  Everything that I have read says they are waiting on a software update \n\nA: Desr Sir,\nI recently purchased the newest model of the Apple MacBook Air and the LG Ultrafine 4K. I had the same issue that the speakers went into overdrive as soon as I turned up the volume to more that 20%. I installed the latest version of the LG screen manager. After a few restarts it resolved this issue.\n\nA: This is fixed in the latest firmware from LG. Unfortunately you have to install it via their Screen Manager software, available here, but it seems to resolve the issue for the most part.\n\nA: I prefer to have the following settings on my LG 5K (and 4K) display.\nSystem preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*alert sound 25%\n\n*system volume 75%\n\n\nThen I use iTunes to control the volume based on the music (sometimes I use SoundCheck automatic volume adjustment - sometimes I don't).\n\nThe speakers are louder than I need them to be, but I can get very soft background music without much fuss using the controls above. I ordered both for testing as soon as they were released and didn't need any software updates for either. I do run macOS 10.12.4 today but didn't have issues on older OS when the displays initially arrived a few months back.\n", "Q: How to get rid of the notification bar glitch on the iPhone 4s if your lock button is broken? My iPhone 4s has the notification bar glitch, and I've been researching on how to fix it. Most of the people said to restart the phone by pressing the home button and lock button at the same time. But my lock button is broken!\n\nA: You can use Assistive Touch to mimic the broken button.\nOnce you enable it (in Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> Assistive Touch), to turn the phone off, you would activate the assistive touch menu, press \"Device\", and then press and hold \"Lock Screen\". \nTo turn the phone back on, plug it in to a power source (battery, wall socket, or computer).\n\nA: Let your phone die and then plug it in to restart it.\n", "Q: iOS Wi-Fi is turned off for some application and cannot turn on? This actually looks like an iOS bug. There are quite some related issues that I cannot put all of them in the problem subject, so I am going to describe the background now.\nUpdate by the end of 2020: Based on the follow-ups and answers, it seems that this problem still exists in iOS 14 and also occurs on Apple Watch.\n\niOS 10 has a region-specific function, that allows Chinese iPhone users to turn off Internet access completely, not just cellular data access. This function is associated with the iPhone model, not with cellular network operators, actual location of users, or language settings. This means it applies to iPhone bought in a Chinese Apple Store, a Chinese authorized store, or from an authorized Chinese website. Not sure if it has to be China, though. Anyway, a US model will not support this function, which means you can only turn off cellular access if your iPhone is a US model. Here is a third-party description of this function but it is in Chinese: 具透 | 你可能不知道，iOS 10 有一个中国「特供」的联网权限功能\nScreenshots for this function:\n\n\n\nThe disturbing problem that I actually wanted to ask, happens this way:\nI have two iPhones, an iPhone 5 (Chinese model, for China Mobile) and an iPhone 5s (US model, for T-mobile, and also works with AT&T), both running iOS 10.2.1 (latest version when I was encountered with the issue). None of them has a SIM card inside, which means I cannot use cellular data on either of them.\nI backed up the iPhone 5 and recovered the backup on the iPhone 5s. The motivation is simply to migrate from one to the other.\nFor most of the applications and settings it worked well.\nHowever, there are two applications, which when I open them, say \"Wi-Fi is turned off for name of the application\". (I cannot provide a screenshot for this because this dialogue only appeared once for impacted apps, even if I re-install the apps.) The dialogue pointed me to Settings, but the US iPhone 5s does not have Wi-Fi on/off switches in the Settings, and cellular data was set to \"on\". Now, these application cannot use the Internet -- they just say \"No Internet connection\".\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off cellular access of impacted apps. Problem persisted.\n\n\n*Turn on cellular access of impacted apps, again. Problem persisted.\n\n\n*Delete the app from the home screen, and reinstall from the App Store. Problem persisted.\n\n\n*Go to Settings/General/Reset, and reset the network settings. Wi-Fi passwords were removed, however, when I reconnect to Wi-Fi, those apps still cannot use Internet.\n\nChecking if anyone has had similar issue, and if possible, how to fix this without resetting everything on the iPhone 5s.\nI am not sure why some apps are impacted while some others are not. Impacted apps are:\n\n*\n\n*CamScanner. It uses Internet to sync scanned files.\n\n\n*不背单词. It is an English learning app that uses Internet to download vocabulary.\nThis might be relevant and might not be. It could be some settings on the iPhone 5 making such difference but I no longer have access to those settings on the iPhone 5 now.\n\nA: 2ND UPDATE:\nIt got worse after iOS 14.2 update. \\WLAN and Data for Camera and some critical apps are turned off so I had to do extensive search, or the phone would become somewhat unusable.\nCause: The cause seems to be the Watch app. There are some connections between apps on the Apple Watch and iOS, and there seem to be a bug regarding how the network setting are shared and sync'ed between Watch and iOS apps. So most likely the problematic apps had been installed both on iOS and Watch.\nSolution: Reset all settings. Resetting network settings wouldn't work. You have to reset all settings (no data or media would be deleted).\nGo to: General > Reset > Reset All Settings. After a reset you are done.\nAll settings will be deleted, so you will need to do some configurations. Wallpapers, dark mode, keyboard, region, date and time, Siri, etc. However you get to keep all your apps and data, which is okay to me.\nDon't forget to turn on Siri as you lose CarPlay capability if Siri is off.\n======\nUPDATE:\nAgain this problem is gone with iOS 14.1 update that was applied two days ago! Apple please look after your regression test.\n======\nSadly, this problem is still there even in latest iOS 14!\nWLAN and Cellular Data will turn off for random apps and could never be turned on. Last time I saw this was on my iPhone SE 1st generation with iOS 12.\nThere was no way to fix the problem. I tried everything. Only after upgrading to iOS 13 did the problem go away and never came back. I thought that was the end of it. I guess there was a structural change made to the configuration table for app network access so the problem was gone.\nNow I encounter the same problem with iOS 14! Nowhere to fix the problem, but can only wait for the next system update.\n\nA: I tried the reset all settings on iOS 14.2 and it did not fix my problem.\nHowever, after resetting all settings, I went to Apple Watch app -> Cellular, and manually turned on Wifi for the apps that were messed up.\nThis seemed to fix my problem, so I’m not sure if “reset all settings” is necessary. That being said, I’ve been battling this problem for many years and I’m happy that I found this helpful post that pointed out the Apple Watch connection!\nMy understanding is that this is due to my Apple Watch being a China eSim model 4, and so there are some China settings that are being sent from watch and affecting the phone apps. Probably a bug of some sort.\n\nA: This bug exists all the way from iOS 10 to 14.4, and Apple did nothing for it.\nSome apps don't have Apple Watch support still have this bug. I've tried hundreds of ways to solve this. The ONLY way you can get the app working is to ERASE YOUR IPHONE and reinstall your app one by one. And what is even more worse is that this bug will come back AGAIN after some days. This is just crazy and driving me mad.\n\nA: Confirm this problem on iPhone 11, iOS 13.7, Chinese model.

I'm not associated to it in any way, I literally installed it to try and achieve the same purpose as the OP.\nFor anything you want to automate, you write little Lua scripts; in this case, I created a network.lua file which I saved next to the main configuration  file, $HOME/.hammerspoon/init.lua. Here's the contents of both:\n# init.lua\n-- Imports\nlocal homeNetwork = require \"network\"\n\n-- Toggle WiFi based on Ethernet being connected or not\nhomeNetwork.setEthernetInterface(\"USB 10/100/1000 LAN\")\nsystemWatcher = hs.caffeinate.watcher.new(homeNetwork.handleWifi)\nsystemWatcher:start()\n\n# network.lua\nlocal M = {}\nlocal ethernetInterface\n\nlocal function isEthernetConnected()\n    ipv4 = hs.network.primaryInterfaces()\n    activeInterfaceName = hs.network.interfaceName(ipv4)\n\n    return activeInterfaceName == ethernetInterface\nend\n\nlocal function toggleWifi()\n    desiredState = not isEthernetConnected() and true or false\n\n    if hs.wifi.interfaceDetails()['power'] ~= desiredState then\n        hs.wifi.setPower(desiredState)\n\n        newState = desiredState and \"on\" or \"off\"\n        hs.alert.show(\"Turning wifi \" .. newState)\n    else\n        hs.alert.show(\"Wifi already in the desired state\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction M.setEthernetInterface(ethernetInterfaceName)\n    ethernetInterface = ethernetInterfaceName\nend\n\nfunction M.handleWifi(event)\n    if event == hs.caffeinate.watcher.systemDidWake then\n        toggleWifi()\n    elseif event == hs.caffeinate.watcher.screensDidUnlock then\n        toggleWifi()\n    end\nend\n\nreturn M\n\nThe only thing you'll have to customise is the name of your Ethernet interface in init.lua; in my case it's \"USB 10/100/1000 LAN\" because I'm using a dock.

My problem is that I'm having issues with terminating a service (pkill and kill are not doing the job, I don't know why), and if I shutdown or restart the computer, the processes are still running in the background.\nThe processes I'm talking about are catalina and tomcat - manually started Apache services. \n\nA: Two items are likely wrong:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*...the processes are still running in the background.  \n  \n*manually started apache processes\n  \n\nBoth are probably not so. They have been restarted automatically. To prevent this,\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to kill the process by sending it the TERM signal\nsudo kill -15 {PID}\n\n\n*Check if your services are restarted automatically by launchd\nlaunchctl list | grep tomcat\n\nIf yes, unload e.g. \nsudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist\n\n\nA: The processes which you mentioned (catalina & tomcat) are not system services. These must have been set to start their daemon when these packages/services are installed and executed for the first time. Please refer this https://www.mulesoft.com/tcat/tomcat-start to get more information on how you can set it to run manually.\n\nA: The way to do this is given in my answer here. However this is not a duplicate as the other question asks about GUI apps.\nThe command you need is shutdown\ne.g. to reboot the machine immediately\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\ne.g. to shutdown the machine in 60 minutes\nsudo shutdown -h +60\n\nIf tomcat and catalina are setup correctly then they will controlled by a launchd setup (or if less well done a Unix script) that will restart the process(es) when the machine starts up or the process is killed. So running kill on then does kill them but another process will start.\n", "Q: Open terminal via Safari Is it possible to open a terminal window from a Safari webpage?\nI have found a way to open a ssh terminal window, but is it possible to only open the terminal window without pre filled commands?\nI have tried to search on google but i only find solutions for opening Safari from terminal.\nTo open terminal with ssh from Safari i put the following link on a webpage: \n<a href=\"ssh://adminuser@10.225.xxx.xxx\">ssh</a>\n\nA: There are three URL types which can open Terminal from Safari:\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh\n\n*telnet\n\n*x-man-page\nThose informations can be found under CFBundleURLTypes key in: /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Info.plist\nSo in order to open Terminal app, you can place link like:\n<a href=\"telnet://\">telnet</a>\n<a href=\"ssh://\">ssh</a>\n<a href=\"x-man-page://\">man page</a>\nIt does not prefill informations in Terminal for me.\n\nBonus:\nThis rule can be applied to any application that can open URLs.\nCheck URL types of the app with:\ndefaults read /absolute/path/to/Info.plist CFBundleURLTypes\nfor example:\ndefaults read /Applications/Utilities/Script\\ Editor.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleURLTypes\nThis gives me applescript as URL type, so making link like:\n<a href=\"applescript://\">Script Editor</a>\nOpens the Script Editor app.\n", "Q: Is Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 (type C) possible? Apple released Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter. Is it possible to connect an external device using type C (ie ASUS MB169B+) by connecting the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter with an Thunderbolt cable into the Mac (this is an older Mac before 2015)?\nCan the MacBook (which only supports Thunderbolt 2) fully access the device which supports type C? The transmission traffic still won't compare with the real Thunderbolt 3 speeds but at least the Thunderbolt 2 ports are not useless!\n\nA: All Mac with thunderbolt 2 are limited since thunderbolt 2 doesn't embed USB C. Even with the thunderbolt 2 to thunderbolt 3 adapter, you could physically connect a USB C display like the ASUS MB169B or the LG 4K Display and they won't work. \nNew Mac with USB C connectors will work and don't need the adapter.  whether you have the MacBook \"one\" or the MacBook Pro that combine thunderbolt 3 and USB C in one physical port, they should connect to USB C displays. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207448 LG 5k (thunderbolt)\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207447 LG 4k (USB)\n\n\nThe only case where a thunderbolt 2 Mac can drive a new connector display with the adapter is if the display supports thunderbolt explicitly as opposed to USB. The LG 5k display is one such new monitor that would work with many thunderbolt 2 Mac. This results in lower resolution, though - 3840 x 2160 @ 60Hz\n\nA: Let's break your question into two questions.\n\n*\n\n*Can I use the ASUS MB169B+ with a Thunderbolt 1/2 Mac?\n\n*Is there a generic way to connect any arbitrary Thunderbolt 3 or USB Type C peripheral to a Thunderbolt 1/2 Mac?\n\nFirst let me address your specific example. The ASUS MB169B+ is actually just a regular USB 3.0 device. It uses a technology called DisplayLink which basically is a video card connected over USB (instead of the typical PCIe connection.)\nBecause MB169B+ is a regular USB device, you can simply connect it to one of your MacBook's regular USB ports and it will work just as well as it would connected to a USB Type C port.\nNow for the second question, can you use a Thunderbolt 3 (or USB Type C) peripheral with a Thunderbolt 2 computer? Theoretically, yes it is possible to create a dongle that accomplishes this. You would have to put a Falcon Ridge controller and an Alpine Ridge controller in to the same dongle and connect them together like so:\n            +--------Thunderbolt 2 to 3 Adapter Box--------+\n            |                +--> PCIe --+                 |\nMacBook --> | Falcon Ridge --|           |--> Alpine Ridge | --> Thunderbolt 3/Type C\n            |                +--> DP ----+                 |\n            +----------------------------------------------+\n\nWhile a dongle exactly as above does not exist, there is an interesting workaround. The Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter you mention has some limited ability here. While the Apple adapter does work as a generic 3 to 2 adapter, it can only go from 2 to 3 if the peripheral on the other side is a native Thunderbolt 3 device. For example, this adapter works for connecting a LG UltraFine 5K Display to a Thunderbolt 2 Mac. However, it won't work with the 2016 21.5\" LG UltraFine 4K Display since that monitor is USB-C only and not a Thunderbolt 3 device. It will work with the 2019 23.5\" LG UltraFine 4K Display since that monitor has Thunderbolt 3.\nNow, here is where things start to get weird. If you buy a Thunderbolt 3 dock, for example the CalDigit TS3 Plus Dock you can use the Apple adapter to connect a Thunderbolt 2 Mac to it. Most Thunderbolt docks have two Thunderbolt ports on them, one upstream port to connect the computer to the dock and one downstream port for daisy chaining more Thunderbolt devices. That downstream port is actually a full featured USB-C port as well, with support for Thunderbolt 3, Display Port Alternate mode, and USB 3.1. So you can actually plug the 2016 21.5\" LG UltraFine 4K Display in to that downstream port and it will work!\nIt's pretty crazy but the following connection sequence actually works:\nThunderbolt 2 Mac --> Thunderbolt 3 to 2 Adapter --> Thunderbolt 3 Dock --> 2016 21.5\" LG 4K\nBut this sequence (un-intuitively) does NOT work:\nThunderbolt 2 Mac --> Thunderbolt 3 to 2 Adapter --> 2016 21.5\" LG 4K\nSo in summary, the combination of the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter with a Thunderbolt 3 dock creates a fully featured (and expensive) Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter.\n\nA: I have the following setup and it does work:\n\n*\n\n*Late 2013 MacBook Pro 15\" (MacBookPro11,3)\n\n*LG UltraFine 4K 23.7\" (this is the 2019 model)\n\n*Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 adapter\n\n*Apple Thunderbolt 2 cable, 0.5m\nPower is not passed though. USB 2.0 is passed through (tested Epson V550 scanner with a USB 2.0 to USB-C adapter). I have not tested USB 3.0 passthrough.\nEdit October 2020: I can confirm that two of these 4K UltraFine displays does work. I duplicated the setup above, except with a 2m Thunderbolt 2 cable instead of 0.5m, and it works well. It does not work if you have the displays daisychained using Thunderbolt 3.

I have a MacPro3,1 and a PowerColor R9 270 GPU that I would like to use together. Unfortunately, this card does not work out of the box unlike my previous Radeon 6870; I never flashed it, but I never had a problem waiting for the login screen for the display to come to life.\nAccording to hackintosh documentation, this GPU should be usable on the Mac by spoofing the device ID using Clover. However, from what I've seen so far it looks like Clover is a replacement for the Mac's EFI, or at least a modification to it which I'm uneasy about.\nIs it advisable to follow this path and use Clover on a real MacPro3,1? If this was a Hackintosh, I wouldn't think much about it, but I do want to keep this machine somewhat pure to avoid any compatibility issues. If I have to sell this GPU and pick up something else, so be it.. but I'd like to think that it isn't that far off to get the R9 270 to work on this machine since it is so close to other devices that are supported officially by Apple.\n(BTW: the card does work in the machine as it functions under Windows 7 / BootCamp)\n\nA: I think you are going about this the wrong way. I think turning your Mac Pro into a hackintosh will create far more problems than it will solve. Updates will be difficult, and clover is a pain to work with. There is a reason hackintoshes are specifically NOT recommended for people who rely on their computers to do important things (such as work).\nThere is a way to get the GPU to work without going through this complicated mess.\nFirst, do you need to see your boot screen on every boot? If so, this becomes more complicated. You'll probably want to jump on the Nvidia train and get a flashed card (the only ones I know of are sold by MacVidCards). The only other option would be to use the new card in tandem with the old one, and have a monitor for the boot screen plugged into the old card. If you don't care about the boot screen most of the time, keep your original card handy, because you will want to be able to access it every now and then (for recovery mode, etc).\nNow assuming you don't need to see the boot screen, you do need the GPU to work. Because you have an AMD GPU, not Nvidia, the drivers are built-in to MacOS. This means that if right now you removed the old GPU you have and put the new GPU in, once you get through the boot sequence, you should see the screen fine.\nPlease let me know if any of this was confusing or did not work.\n", "Q: My mac mini freezes - only mouse cursor is alive.

Are you sure you want to proceed?\n[Lower Security Settings] [Cancel]\n\n\nThis appears even when the selected item in the Finder cannot be quick-looked (e.g. AVI files).\nDoes anyone have any idea what it means and what causes it? This hasn't appeared before the latest software update and no search results match the alert text, so I'm suspecting this is something new in the OS update.\nOS: macOS Sierra 10.12.4\nHardware: Mid-2012 MacBook Pro\n\nA: Just came across this issue for the first time and have an answer for how to fix it (without blindly lowering your security settings.)\nThe good thing about TimeMachine is that you can transparently transfer files when you move computers. This is also a bad thing. The software causing this issue for me was a codec pack I installed in 2006(!) and had long forgotten about. Take a look through the following folders, looking for anything that you don't think you need (if you installed it 15 years ago, you probably don't need it!)\n~/Library/QuickTime/\n~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/\n~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/\n~/Library/Components/\n\nAfter deleting items (e.g. rm -rf ~/Library/Quicktime/Perian.component in my case) restart Finder (sudo pkill Finder in the terminal) and try using Quick Look again.\n\nA: I have come across one (!) reply on the Apple boards.\nI want anyone who reads this to take it with a grain of caution. This 'answer' does not seem to ring as '110%' accurate.\n\nYou are using a Codec component that is not compatible with macOS Sierra. That Codec component was a part of a library that conflicts with macOS Sierra and in order for Quicktime to load would require to change the \"Quick Look UI Helper\" security settings. If you really need that Codec component you can proceed by clicking \"Quick Look UI Helper\" Lower Security Settings.\n\n(Here's the link; https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7948198?start=0&tstart=0)\n", "Q: Wrong dictionary in spotlight for macOS I have a 2016 MacBook Pro with macOS 10.12 Sierra.

When I look up a English word, it shows me the translation from English to Dutch, which is really annoying.\nDoes anybody have a solution to that?\nThe dictionary works fine, if I just right click a word, and look it up.\n\nI have the following dictionaries enables under the dictionary preferences:\n\nAnd the following Language and Region settings under system preferences:\n\nAnd lastly, my keyboard input language is Danish.\n\nUpdate\nI don't know what happen but suddenly the spotlight dictionary works again.

Try dragging \"Oxford Dictionary of English\" into the spot above \"English-Dansk\" and see if that provides the answer you are looking for.\n", "Q: Why the difference in audio volume via bluetooth? I hope I'm in the right spot for this.\nI have my volume on the phone set to 100%. I connect via bluetooth to my car. My car's radio volume goes from 0 to 45. Now, when I listen to music, my car's volume is set to 10-15. However, when I listen to a book from Audible, or make a phone call, the radio volume needs to get at 37+ to be able to hear it. Is there anything I can do to equalize the volume between apps?\n\nA: Every output device has a maximum volume level in its settings. This is different than the current listening volume of the main volume. \nFor instance,  I have internal speakers, external speakers, alerts, midi Dj'ing equipment and bluetooth PA system speakers.\nIf I go to the sound preferences, there are different default volumes for each device. No matter the main volume those will override current main volume on plug in , activation or connection of a different device.\nIndividually they all have their own settings and ultimately they can be found in the sound preferences.\nThen as some mentioned, the device you are connecting to, can also have its own defaults that override your connecting device.\n", "Q: Is the a CLI way to download all photos from a Photos.app iCloud shared album? Is there a way from the CLI on MacOS or Linux to download all the photos from a shared photo album (an album shared with me from another iCloud user, that shows up the shared tab on iOS or under the shared heading on MacOS) in Photos.app? I would like to setup a cron job to sync the photos locally so I can add them to the rest of our backuped data. \n\nA: Take a look at iCloud Photos Downloader it is a command line interface for iCloud Photos based on Python. \nTo install, you can type pip install icloudpd should the requirement of Python 2.7.x or 3.6.x be met. If you use Python 2.6.x will fail. \nIf you require Python, I reccomend using Homebrew Package Manager, which is known for being easy to install command line tools. If you’re going to install Python with this method, type brew install python\nYou can also install Python using the package found on their website. \nIf you’re looking for more info about the package and command usages / 2 Factor Authentication scenarios, take a look at the Repository’s Readme. \n", "Q: Is there a USB trackpad I would like to use a track pad on a Windows machine. \nThe catch is : I would like to use it through a KVM switch.

It uses the \"Unifying Nano Receiver\" that plugs into a USB port.\n\nI've used many wireless Logitech mice on KVMs (mostly Avocent) and all worked flawlessly.

I need to create an alias on my Desktop to an app in my Applications folder, using a bash script file.\nAs far as I know, it's only possible with AppleScript.\nUnfortunately, my AppleScript skills are non-existent. \nI couldn't find a good working example on how to create an alias on my Desktop.\n1) How do I create an alias on my Desktop using AppleScript?\n2) How do I insert this AppleScript into my bash script file so that it could work in Terminal?\n\nA: osascript will run AppleScript code in your shell. This example uses a HEREDOC to present the code to osascript.\n/usr/bin/osascript <<'EOF'\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set myapp to POSIX file \"/Applications/Chess.app\" as alias\n    make new alias to myapp at Desktop\n    set name of result to \"Chess.app\"\nend tell\nEOF\n\nSource- Link\n\nA: Why not skip the Applescript and just create a symbolic link in bash?  It behaves exactly like an alias on the desktop except now you can work with it in bash.    See this answer for a breakdown of aliases, hard links and sym links.\nSo, your command would be:\nln -s /path/to/application/MyApp.app /Users/username/Desktop/MyApp\nWhere MyApp.app and username is the name of the application and the user respectively.\n\nA: osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to set name of (make alias file to (POSIX file \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app\" as alias) at POSIX file \"/Users/<YOUR USERNAME>/Desktop\") to \"desired alias file name\"'\n\n", "Q: Apple File Vault & HD erasing I am at the point where I am about to erase the HD on my old iMac 2009 running El Cap before selling it.\nI recently turned on FileVault to encrypt the volume mainly to see how it worked and also as an aide to what I thought was going to be a quick and secure erasure of that HD.\nI have reached this point following these instructions on MacWorld:\nWith a FileVault-encrypted startup disk, you can restart into OS X Recovery and launch Disk Utility to erase the volume. However, before erasing, you need to select the disk and then choose File > Unlock “volume name”. Enter the password for any FileVault-enabled user account, and the disk is unlocked and can be erased.\nWhen I choose Erase, the next window gives me the warning:  Are you sure you want to erase the partition “Macintosh HD” and create an encrypted partition?  Warning:  Files on this partition will be encrypted using this password.  If you forget the password, your data will be lost.\nIt's either cancel, and then I can't erase my HD or continue.\nNot sure what I am doing at this point and could use some help.  \nAm I setting up FileVault for the next owner of this iMac?\nWhat does the message in this window really mean?\nMany thanks.\n\nA: Once FileVault is done with the encryption, you can \"cryptographically\" and fairly instantaneously erase the drive by destroying the keys to decrypt.\nI wouldn't bother setting up the next encryption. To do that, boot to recovery and do not unlock the disk.\nJust repartition the drive.\nThat wipes the keys that the passphrase would have used to decrypt the drive. It's now cryptographically erased.\nAt that point, you might install a clean OS and shut down the Mac when the \"welcome to Mac\" screen prompts you to create an account and set up the Mac.\nShutting down then lets the next person know the Mac works, and you know it's securely erased. \n", "Q: To what extent is system integrity protection affected if the attacker knows your Mac account password? In the cast that malware and/or a trojan has infected macOS, can an attacker disable system integrity protection and inject code and do other harmful stuff? Can an attacker even discover your admin password before disabling sip as keylogging software would be needed? If he can't discover the password that way then lets say he guesses it because the passcode is really simple.\n\nA: SIP itself is not an issue, since that requires physical presence to disable (to wit: rebooting the machine into recovery mode and running a terminal command). At no point during the process of changing SIP settings is your account password required.\nHowever, there's an old adage in computer security: If someone has physical access to your computer, it isn't your computer anymore. \nIf a remote hacker has your account password, they could access various network services if they can reach the ports, get an SSH shell, impersonate you, and so forth.\nIf a hacker sitting in front of your keyboard has your account password, the hacker having your account password is the least of your worries.\n", "Q: can i find usb path and save to variable for quick backups? i would like to add the path to inserted flash drive named backup1 to a variable so i can copy /Documents/dir to this flash drive path in one script without user interaction\n\nA: Try B=/Volumes/backup1 and then cp -p /Documents/dir/* $B.\n", "Q: My finder's sidebar is empty My finder's sidebar is empty (see attachement), this happens about once every two weeks, I would be working on my mac and suddenly the sidebar becomes empty.\nIt works again after a restart, but it is a great inconvenience to have to do that each time.\n\n\nA: The first thing I would do is run a cleaning utility (like Onyx), reboot and see if cleaning up caches, running disk repair, maintenance scripts, etc. does the trick.\nFailing that go to Apple support and download the latest Combo Updater that matches your current OS version and run that. Combo updaters often fix odd macOS behavior.\n", "Q: How do I make my windows partition show up at boot time without holding option? How do I make my windows partition show up at boot time without holding option?\nI had this setup on a Macbook pro way back when that was setup this way. I recently bought an iMac and would like to decide which partition I want to use at runtime without holding option. Is this still an available feature? Right now it automatically loads the windows partition.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no default boot loader option built-in to Macs. Your best bet is going with a custom bootloader like rEFInd (see http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/ for download and instructions). Normally I don't just include a link and call it a day but obviously I'm not going to have an alternative download available for someone else's program... and if the program is still available to download, the instructions will be right there with it at the program's site.\nIf after downloading, reading the documentation, and attempting the setup for this you still have issues, I recommend putting up a fresh question specific to that.\nAside from that, there are no options without getting very low level into nvram settings that you do NOT want to mess with... or at the very least I will not help someone mess with.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: I can't force quit an app (Wine)! I installed Wine to open an .exe file on my Mac. I think I did something wrong and when I opened the file it installed to the Applications folder. Now, It doesn't let me force quit. I tried clicking \"Force Quit\" from the Apple menu and it didn't work. Now I can't turn my Mac off.\nHow can I force quit the Windows application running under Wine on my Mac?\n\nA: Use Terminal to kill the Wine process.\nFrom the Wine FAQ\n\n10.2 Crashes and Freezes\n10.2.1 My program froze up, how do I close it?\nIf you ran the program from a terminal window by typing wine\nprogram.exe, you can usually just go back to that terminal window and\npress Ctrl+C. If you ran the application some other way, such as from\na launcher shortcut, then you can open up a terminal and forcibly kill\nthe process:\nkillall -9 Application.exe\n\nIf you want to kill all Wine programs at once, you can run:\nwineserver -k \n\nYou can also open up a Wine version of the Windows task manager by\nrunning wine taskmgr in a terminal. This will allow you to kill\nindividual Wine processes.\n\n\nA: You can also open your activity monitor and kill it from there.\n\nA: If the traditional methods do not work, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force quit from the app icon menu in the Dock\n\n*Force quit from the apple menu\n\n*Force quit from Alt + Command + Esc menu\n\n*Finding the app and quitting it from the Activity monitor\n\n*And you do not want to use the hard cold reboot by pressing and holding the Power button\n\n\nYou could try rebooting from the Terminal window and enter:\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: iPhone, is Reset Network settings necessary after a Carrier profile install? My phone carrier requested an update of the Carrier Profile (Delete + Install).\nThey suggested also to perform a Reset Network settings after the profile installation.\nIs it really necessary?\nI don't mind doing a reset-network, but among the things the reset does, all Wi-Fi passwords are deleted as well, which is annoying.\n\nA: No, you don't have to reset the network settings. Your phone carrier is just being thorough, as updating the profile can result in some unexpected behaviour for some users and resetting network settings usually resolves this.\nI've personally only ever had to reset network settings once on an iPhone after a profile update, so you can just install the new profile and reset network settings afterwards if you start noticing some weird behaviour.\n", "Q: Do Terminal processes stop if Mac sleeps? I'm running some Python machine learning programs through Terminal that take hours at a time to finish. If I leave my computer unattended it hibernates - the screen goes off and I have to type in my password again.\nWhen this happens, does my script get cancelled, paused, or continue the same? I would hate to think that my script could be 99% finished, and then gets aborted because my computer went to sleep.\n\nA: All processes get paused when the system goes to sleep, independent of whether the process is part of macOS, an application or some code you wrote on your own. After the system wakes up again, all processes will continue to run. \nPS: Processes which were waiting for network or disk data when going to sleep may run into timeouts though. But that can happen anyway so most processes should be able to handle that anyway.\n\nA: Yes, terminal processes like a python script will stop execution when the machine goes into idle sleep. \nTo prevent your machine from sleeping without changing the settings you can just use the terminal tool caffeinate. Once called it will prevent the machine from sleeping until you cancel the program using ctrl+c.\nYou can pass arguments like the process id to caffeinate using the -w flag. You can find out a process id using the top command in the terminal, e.g. caffeinate -w 36388 would prevent the machine from going into sleep until that process is finished.\nSee the attached link for more information.\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/245683/how-to-prevent-your-mac-from-sleeping-with-no-additional-software/#:~:text=To%20open%20the%20Terminal%2C%20you,you%20leave%20the%20Terminal%20running.\n\nA: Note that there is a difference between computer sleep and display sleep (both controlled in the Energy Saver pane of System Preferences). When the display is sleeping but the computer is not, programs on your computer continue to run normally.

If I call the shell script as root user (login via sudo su in terminal), it works just perfectly. So, the script is ok. It must have something to do with the cron job itself.\nFor doing so, I edited the root's crontab using crontab -e like so:\n10 12 * * 1-5 sh /var/root/cronjobs/mysql_backup.workdaily.sh\n\nThis tells the crontab daemon to execute it every work day (monday to friday) at 12.10 PM.\nWith the same call from terminal it works (as described above).\nThis is the shell script that I am using for doing it:\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\nLOCALMOUNTPOINT=\"/Volumes/MyDrive\"\n\n# check if network drive is mounted\nif mount | grep \"on $LOCALMOUNTPOINT\" > /dev/null; then\n    echo \"mounted\"\nelse\n    # not needed the below check, but much more safer in cron job execution:\n    if ls -lha /Volumes | grep \"$LOCALMOUNTPOINT\" > /dev/null; then\n        mount -t afp \"afp://username:password@NETWORKDRIVE%28AFP%29._afpovertcp._tcp.local/Subfolder\" /Volumes/MyDrive\n    else\n        mkdir /Volumes/MyDrive && mount -t afp \"afp://username:password@NETWORKDRIVE%28AFP%29._afpovertcp._tcp.local/Subfolder\" /Volumes/MyDrive\n    fi\nfi\n\nmysqldump -u root -ppassword --all-databases | gzip -c > $(date \"+/Volumes/MyDrive/Dumps/mysql/username/full__%FT%H_%M_%S.sql.gz\")\n\nThe cron job creates a file on network drive with a file size of 20 Bytes.

Even better, Microsoft documents them so people don't waste time troubleshooting things. Will one or more affect you? That's harder to tell, but we have thousands of daily users in our company using these apps heavily.

WatchOS 3 included a breathe app that gives occasional reminders to \"take a minute to breathe\".\nWhat prompts these reminders? Does it monitor your heart rate to know when you're stressed, or does it remind you at preset times?\n\n\nA: By default, breathe reminders are set to display every 5 hours.

When people start speaking to me in the office I need to find the phone, push the home button and click pause.\nIs it possible to connect the phone with my Macbook Pro via Bluetooth and then pause the podcast via a click/keyboard shortcut on my laptop? This would save me approximately 2 seconds per pause - these seconds add up over time(!)\n\nA: Someone else may be able to provide a better solution, but nothing I can think of avoids having to play the podcast directly from the MacBook Pro. That is, you play the file on your MBP and stream it to your iPhone for listening to (with or without your headphones). But, unless you need to listen to your podcast as you walk around the office, there's really no advantage of this over just plugging the headphones in directly to the MBP.\nNevertheless, if this is something you're interested in, you can check out the following software:\n\n\n*\n\n*Airfoil \n\n*AirPhones\nUndoubtedly there will be other options out there too. My understanding is you can try Airfoil for free (not sure about AirPhones). But as I mentioned above, these options require you to play your podcasts from the MacBook Pro, so unless you want the freedom to get up / walk around, you would be better off just plugging your headphones into your Mac.\nNote: I have no affiliation with either Airfoil or AirPhones.\n", "Q: Can I use the Bedtime alarm on iOS without using it as a morning alarm? I use Sleep Cycle as an alarm clock/sleep tracker, but it doesn't offer a bedtime reminder functionality. Is there any way to use the native Bedtime alarm on iOS 10 without using it as a wakeup alarm as well?\n\nA: It doesn't seem like there's a way to do this natively. This is probably because the Bedtime feature is a supercharged alarm -- one which tracks your sleep (although it's not as advanced as Sleep Cycle) and shows you the bedtime notifications. Being able to remove the alarm notification completely would void this core functionality.\nHowever, you could use some other app other than the Clock app for the reminder functionality. \nYou could simply use the Reminders app, which allows you to set daily recurring reminders. You could even set it to give you a \"bedtime reminder\" every weekday with a custom repeat option. The advantage of this is that it's completely native. From the notification, you can snooze the reminder by an hour (unfortunately the 15 minute snooze option was removed in iOS 10). A big advantage is that it will stay on the screen even if you unlock your phone, until you mark it as complete. This does not seem to be the case with the clock app's reminder. However, this can be a disadvantage as well, if you want it to dismiss automatically.\nAnother option would be to use an app such as Due, $4.99. It allows you to set a recurring reminder, but also allows you to snooze it from the lock screen. I haven't personally tried it, but it might allow you to customize the snooze duration. However, I wouldn't use the repeating reminder option, as it seems to have become broken due to iOS 10's new notification API.\n", "Q: Prevent window autoselect on application launch When I am typing in an application (say Terminal), and I want to google something, I open Safari. While safari opens and loads tabs and whatnot, I want to keep typing in terminal to get work done. However, after about a second the Safari window gets automatically selected, and whatever I am in the middle of typing suddenly gets input into safari instead.\nSo I deal with it and click back on Terminal to keep typing. After another second, Safari reselects itself, and I have the same problem. I click back to Terminal, and it happens a third time.\nIt's extremely annoying, and can be hazardous, for instance when an alert pops up in the newly launched application and I just happen to hit Enter on my keyboard (expecting it to be input into Terminal), causing the alert to instantly disappear after it pops up, potentially doing unwanted actions on my computer.\nI don't know if it happens three times with Safari (it was just an example), but I know it has happened at least three times before with a single application launch.\nIs there any way to turn off this feature?\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, there is no ideal solution, unless you're willing to disable SIP (maybe).\nI think your best bet may be the bash command open:\nBash:\nopen -ga \"Google Chrome\"\n\nApplescript: \ndo shell script \"open -ga 'Google Chrome' \"\n\nThese will open the specificed appliction without stealing focus\n\nThe application names are case sensitive\n\n\n\nIf I only needed this while using terminal, I'd perhaps use aText to expand open chrome to the above command and so on... Not that it's much shorter, but I'd prefer that.\n\n\nYou can use third party applications to launch apps and scripts: \nAlfred, Launchbar, FastScripts, Apptivate etc... there are tons of apps that do this.\nYou could also make an Application using Automator.app, that just runs the terminal command and you can add that app to the dock. This has it's own problems though, because the actual application icon will show up in the Dock as soon as you click your custom Dock icon and now you got two icons for the same app in the dock... oh well.\n\n\nAs a side note, you can also open a specific website:\nBash:\nopen -ga \"Google Chrome\" \"http://askdifferent.com\"\n\nApplescript:\ndo shell script \"open -ga 'Google Chrome' 'http://askdifferent.com' \"\n\n\nIn other applications you can open a file by replacing the url with a path to a file.\n\n", "Q: Cannot get more than 29.88 Hertz refresh rate from 2016 MacBook Pro and Acer XR342CK monitor I'm connecting to an Acer XR342CK with a 2016 MacBook Pro 13 via HDMI cable. The monitor is capable of 75 Hertz at full resolution and the laptop is capable of 60 Hertz. However, when connected either through the Apple USB-C Multiport adapter of the USB-C Dock from CalDigit, the the Mac shows a Refresh Rate of 29.88 Hertz (NTSC):\n\nI tried the DisplayPort cable that came with the monitor and when I connected it to the MacBook Pro through the CalDigit USB-C dock, it caused my laptop to freeze up then reboot. This happens every time I connect it.\nIf I lower the resolution from 3440 x 1440 to 2560 x 1080 the Refresh Rate will default to 60 Hertz, but will be greyed out still. Something very strange is going on with this setup.\nThere are no Mac drivers for this monitor. Is there anything I can do to get the full 60 Hertz, which both the monitor and laptop support?\n\nA: As it turns out, the Acer XR342CK monitor is not compatible with the 2016 MacBook Pro 13\" (and possibly 15\", I haven't tried). I talked to two different Acer support techs and they both told me there is a compatibility problem between the laptop and monitor.\nTo verify this information, I was able to get the monitor to connect with the same cables I was using to a Mac Pro tower with an NVIDIA GTX 980 and it worked flawlessly and reached 75 Hertz by default.\nI have purchased and tested two of these monitors and they both displayed the same problem with connectivity and refresh rate (and caused my MacBook to hang/reboot). Both of these monitors also have terrible image persistence/burn-in/echo, something to keep in mind if you are considering one of these monitors for your setup.\nI sure wish Apple would make a curved display.\n\nA: You need at least HDMI 2.0 to support 60Hz.  \nWhen looking for a cable, make sure it says \"60Hz\" or \"4K, UHD, or 2.x\" in the description like this HDMI Cable (personally use this one in our presentation rooms)\nThat said, your monitor is capable of a Display Port connection - I prefer (highly) to not convert from one signal to another - just keep everything the same.  I would go with a mini Dispay Port to Display Port cable and keep everything native.  Be sure that cable is at least 1.4 or higher\n\nA: My MacBook drives a Acer XR342CK display at 70 MHz, but only when using a Mini DisplayPort cable.\n\nA: OK, This will help many concerning Mac and the XR382CQK Acer Monitor:\nHere's my setup:\nOS 10.13.1 High Sierra \n2016 Macbook Pro 15\" (with touch bar)\nAcer XR382CQK 38\" curved Monitor\nIf you have anything different than the above, this may be helpful, but may vary.  Other 2015-2017 MacBooks should have similar results as detailed below though.\nFrom the box, I attempted to hook up my new Acer monitor using the thunderbolt power cord that came with my MacBook since no USB-C or USB-C type cable came with the monitor.  All I got was 6 dings from the computer as the monitor attempted to cycle through all of its possible inputs.  I spent a couple of hours attempting to adjust any and all monitor and computer parameters to get it to work.  Nothing.\nI was able to get the HDMI to work through an HDMI-to-USB-C converter plug, but the refresh rate was only around 30 Hz at highest resolution.  I also was able to then plug in the MacBook Thunderbolt cable from the monitor into a second port of my MacBook to get the power charging to work in tandem.  I did this for around 3 days which worked perfectly, but one reason I got this monitor was to eliminate cables.  Then I had a thought.  I re-read the Acer installation manual and it said to use a USB-C CABLE (not thunderbolt)!  I was using a Thunderbolt cable.  So I bought 2 different USB-C 3.1 cables to see if they would work.  YES IT DID!  So Friends, go buy yourself a Veckle B071XSDH9D USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 cable (or probably any 3.1 gen 2), and utilize the TOP Acer resolution at 75 Hz refresh like me.  This cable also charges my MacBook at the same time.  Finally!  What a pain.  I think the thunderbolt & USB-C details out to the general public are really not clear, and why all of the confusion is out there.  Enjoy!  I love this monitor!  Also, get BetterSnapTool app to snap your windows around.  This setup COOKS!\n", "Q: MacBook Pro on any wifi stays connected but won't load pages after a few minutes This started happening a couple weeks ago and I am at a loss. The issue has been happening on every wifi I have connected tom: my phone via tethering, my university's guest and student wifi, and third party wifi at a coffee shop.\nThis is what happens: After a reboot and connecting to any wifi it will work for between 30 seconds and 5 minutes, then it still says that it is connected but no web pages will load (tested in safari and chrome.)\nWhat I've tried:\n• Reseting PRAM\n• Reseting SMC\n• Removing all known wifi networks\n• Creating another user account (same issue)\n• Changing DNS IP addresses\n• Reinstalling the OS (while preserving user data)\n• Tethering to phone's network via BlueTooth with wifi off (same issue, stops working after a few minutes)\nAnd finally I have tried installing windows 10 with bootcamp. When booted into windows the issue does not appear, so because of this it seems to me that it is not a hardware issue. So I am really lost, does anyone have any other ideas I could try?\n\nA: I had faced same. Sometimes cable connected to wifi card becomes loose which can cause this issue.\nCan you check once what RSSI you are getting when you are scanning the the Wi-Fi network? Usually macOS at -70 dBm RSSI shows very less connectivity but windows works fine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on \"Apple\" icon.\n\n*Select \"About the mac\"\n\n*One window will pop-up then select \"System Report\"\n\n*One another window will pop-up. Select \"Wi-Fi\" under \"Network\" option.\n\n\nyou will get all the network list. All the scanned network will have a field \"Signal/Noise\", where you will get your RSSI value. \n\nA: It turns out the problem was a VPN client I had installed a while ago, I didn't think of it because it hadn't been running for quite a while but uninstalling it fixed my issue.\n", "Q: connect AirPods to MacBook Air (Early 2014) with Sierra - Bluetooth pairing doesn't work I followed the steps in Connect AirPods to MacBook / Macbook Pro with Mac OS Sierra (warning, Youtube video).\n\nI tried and tried and never see AirPods.\nI have a Early 2014 MacBook Air with Sierra. Does this only works with new MacBooks? Is there a technical reason?\n\nA: After installing the update macOS Sierra 10.12.4 the connection to AirPods working fine.\nIn release notes About the macOS Sierra 10.12.4 Update nothing about AirPods written.\n", "Q: Safari beach-balling on some websites like Github.com Safari has been stalling when I load some websites. Github.com is the most reproducible. The page would load, but then my mouse would turn to a beach-ball and just get stuck until I close the tab with Github or whatever site seems to be causing it.\nI am not running any extensions - to be honest I don't know what it could be. My boss is having the same issue as well. I have no issues with loading Github on Chrome.\nI am running macOS Sierra (10.12.1) on a Late 2014 Mac mini and Safari 10.0.1. It also happens on the Safari Technology Preview (Release 26, 10.2)\nWhat are ways to fix this or further diagnose slow web sites in safari?\n\nA: Release 26 of Safari TP contains many changes to the rendering engine. This causes problems with many websites, especially where image sprites are used extensively.\nThis will likely be fixed in the next release, but until then, you can just use the standard install of Safari, or downgrade to the previous version of Safari TP if you still have the installer. You can also try running with Disable Caches selected in the Develop menu.\n\nA: Safari's web inspector is where I'd start. Use the develop mode in settings and then navigate to https://github.com and turn on the Timelines view.\n\nAfter a few refreshes, you should have the home page cached and rendering in less than 2 seconds.\nThen try a project page (which should render much faster than your home page or the main home page).\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/kitzy/MacDeploymentScripts\nThat renders for me in 400 ms or so repeatably with some longer running events that don't affect the initial page load to my eyes.\n\nIf you think there are network delays (or SSL negotiation / checking issues) the network view will show your Safari stalling or not requesting resources in a timely manner. Check performance against another network if you can - web filtering or proxies can cause what you're seeing. Hard to know without some more details.\n", "Q: Apple Mail, producing multiple duplicate drafts on gmail Apple Mail is producing multiple duplicate drafts on gmail.\nAfter I send a message, there are multiple drafts of it left :-(.\nThat totally kills productivity and confidence. As I see the leftover draft, I'm never sure if I did actually send the message or not.\nNot having a draft == msg was sent, but not in this case.\nI had a similar problem with my previous company IMAP server.\nWhat is the cause and how can I fix it?\nAre you guys/girls using Apple Mail with GMail?\n\nA: I've seen this behavior using Apple Mail since macOS Sierra. I haven't found a workaround d yet, but I know the email is sent because there is a copy in my Sent folder. Once a week or so, I go into the Google Inbox (should work for classic GMail too) Drafts folder and delete the email threads that are marked \"Draft\". This clears up the duplicates from Apple Mail on next sync. \nMy guess is Apple Mail, when saving drafts periodically to the server (Google) while one is drafting an email, is not using the right mechanism (API call) such that every draft version collapses into one on Google end. This incorrect mechanism results in each draft showing up as individual \"drafts\".\n\nA: I use apple mail with gmail. Only solution I know is to set drafts to only be stored on your mac and not upload to gmail. This means a clean gmail but you won't be able to access your drafts off your computer.\nI personally just left it as is, hasn't bothered me too much.\nThis issue happens because gmail and mail simply handle drafts differently.\n", "Q: How do you turn off AirPlay on ipad3?I'm trying to watch Netflix in my car but it just shows a tv box and says \"you are now watching on your tv\" As stated I'm trying to watch Netflix in my car. Called Netflix they say to turn off AirPlay on my iPad. Can't find it anywhere on my iPad. Is there a way to do this? It's weird if I move the search button it shows were I am in the show. \n\nA: To turn off airplay on iOS 10 you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and then swipe to the right. At the bottom of that view you'll see a triangle icon with circles, click that and change the source to iPad.\n", "Q: Is it safe to expand this Macintosh HD partition? A few years a go a friend of mine help me set up a partition on my MacBook air to allow me to run Windows 8.\nAbout a year ago I decided I didn't want it anymore, and with the help of the internet, I tried but mangled the uninstallation. I thought I had uninstalled it but didn't see any improvement in space on the Mac side of things.\nI thought I had issues because when I started up my laptop, I was still getting the windows start up (albeit broken beyond repair.) I now believe that this is just leftover files trying to boot what's already there.\nHere is what I'm left with in Disk Utility:\n\nIs it safe for me to try to expand the partition back to it's original size? I can move the line with no issues. Do I risk losing data?\n\nA: \nIs it safe for me to try to expand the partition back to it's original size?\n\nYes, it should be safe to try to expand the partition back to its size. You can do this either by dragging the line or typing a number larger than 251 in the \"Size\" box.\n\nDo I risk losing data?\n\nAny time you make changes to a drive (including resizing a partition), you risk losing data. I would argue that the risk is small but you should ALWAYS have an up-to-date backup. Make a backup immediately before you attempt the resize.\n", "Q: Should I restart after uninstalling software or drivers on a mac? I know that the Mac doesn't use a registry, but is there anything I'm unaware of that would make it better to restart a mac after an uninstall of software, a printer etc.?\n\nA: I'm going to just posit a general rule of thumb here - \nIf it needs you to restart it will tell you - or even make you.\nMore specifically,\nIf it doesn't need an uninstaller, then just trashing the app requires no further action.\nIf you use something like AppCleaner to also sweep up the prefs, there is still no further action required.\nIf it needs an uninstaller, the uninstaller will tell you if a restart will be required.\nHowever, just to be on the safe side...\nIf you manually pull kexts etc out of the system using Terminal - restart is safest.\nThe rule of thumb works on a simple 'Did it change the system?'\nIf not, then no restart\nIf it did, then yes.\n", "Q: 100% full USB stick un-mountable after forced eject During an rsync my USB stick became 100% full without me noticing it.\nWhen I tried to eject it, I got a message that it was in use, but no application was named and I could not see anything that was using it, so I took the option to \"force-eject\" it.\nAfter unplugging and replugging the USB stick it silently failed to mount.\nHere's my diskutil list:\n(stable) └─❱❱❱ diskutil list                                          1 ⏎  +6150 22:06 ❰─┘\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS MacL2938                250.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *124.2 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS USB128GB                123.9 GB   disk1s2\n\nThe culprit is disk1.\nMounting it fails:\n(stable) └─❱❱❱ diskutil mount readOnly USB128GB                       1 ⏎  +6160 22:17 ❰─┘\nVolume on disk1s2 failed to mount\nIf the volume is damaged, try the \"readOnly\" option\n\nand the volume info indicates the 0 Bytes available space (possibly the reason for the problems?)\n(stable) └─❱❱❱ diskutil info USB128GB    +6130 20:45 ❰─┘\n   Device Identifier:        disk1s2\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk1s2\n   Whole:                    No\n   Part of Whole:            disk1\n   Device / Media Name:      USB128GB\n\n   Volume Name:              USB128GB\n\n   Mounted:                  No\n\n   File System Personality:  HFS+\n   Type (Bundle):            hfs\n   Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended\n   Journal:                  Unknown (not mounted)\n   Owners:                   Disabled\n\n   Partition Type:           Apple_HFS\n   OS Can Be Installed:      No\n   Media Type:               Generic\n   Protocol:                 USB\n   SMART Status:             Not Supported\n   Volume UUID:              D41ECDE8-6BEF-300F-B654-F1DB70D5425B\n   Disk / Partition UUID:    6233D470-4709-4BE6-9DD9-1AD6997F5013\n\n   Total Size:               123.9 GB (123874533376 Bytes) (exactly 241942448 512-Byte-Units)\n   Volume Free Space:        0 B (0 Bytes) (exactly 0 512-Byte-Units)\n   Device Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\n   Read-Only Media:          Yes\n   Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (not mounted)\n\n   Device Location:          External\n   Removable Media:          Yes\n   Media Removal:            Software-Activated\n\nThe verifyDisk fails:\n(stable) └─❱❱❱ diskutil verifyDisk disk1                                   +6151 22:07 ❰─┘\nStarted partition map verification on disk1\nChecking prerequisites\nChecking the partition list\nChecking the partition map size\nChecking for an EFI system partition\nChecking the EFI system partition's size\nChecking the EFI system partition's file system\nChecking the EFI system partition's folder content\nProblems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting\nError: -69842: Couldn't mount disk\n\nwhile the volume USB128GB seems to be okay:\n(stable) └─❱❱❱ diskutil verifyVolume USB128GB                         1 ⏎  +6152 22:08 ❰─┘\nStarted file system verification on disk1s2 USB128GB\nVerifying file system\nChecking Journaled HFS Plus volume\nChecking extents overflow file\nChecking catalog file\nChecking multi-linked files\nChecking catalog hierarchy\nChecking extended attributes file\nChecking volume bitmap\nChecking volume information\nThe volume USB128GB appears to be OK\nFile system check exit code is 0\nFinished file system verification on disk1s2 USB128GB\n\nrepairDisk fails as well:\n(stable) └─❱❱❱ diskutil repairDisk disk1                                   +6158 22:15 ❰─┘\nUnable to repair this whole disk: A writable disk is required (-69772)\n\nDoes a device need remaining space to be repairable?

It's an iPhone 6 and I am on a plan where I can't replace it for a while.\n\nA: In general, no. iOS devices that come with adhesive seals need some special tools and training to repair.\nMost people can work odd jobs, cook meals at home, do other things to get paid for less time and money than taking the device to a repair shop to have someone do the work that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*already trained\n\n*already purchased all the tools\n\n*already knows where to get parts (and probably gets them in bulk for cheaper than we can)\n\n\nThat being said, don't let anyone say you shouldn't roll up your sleeves and try to learn / fix / break something.

Before I could at least see my texts etc, now its just at the spot where I enter a wifi network and I can't enter the password because I can't use the full screen and keyboard! Im hoping there is some way I can use my phone through the MacBook!! Only been using Apple products a short while though so I'm not familiar with all the mac can do. Can anyone help? I know before I had the phone reset I had it synced with the MacBook so I could see my messages and stuff from there but its not anymore. Shouldn't there be some kind of app I could use on another Mac device to control my iPhone? thanks!\n\nA: This isn't a complete answer because there's no simple way to really control the phone via mouse and keyboard. I can get you past that screen though.\nFirst, plug your phone into your computer.\nThen open QuickTime Player and choose \"New Movie Recording\". Using the little drop down right next to the record button, switch it from the built in camera to the name of your phone. You don't have to actually record it, but this will allow you to see the full screen.\nNext, go to iTunes and open the page for the device (this button: ). Then scroll down in that Options part and click \"Configure Accessibility…\". Under Seeing, choose VoiceOver, and then click OK.\nNow you can use your phone, but it's going to be tedious to type.\nTo cycle through all the buttons on screen, swipe left and right. To click one, double tap on the screen. This includes the keyboard keys, so you can slowly type the wifi password. (However, you can hold off on typing that in, and skip this screen for now. You will be able to use the Mac's keyboard to type)\nIf you download Mocha Keyboard Lite to your computer, and on your phone, use VoiceOver to go through the Bluetooth settings, you can enable Bluetooth and connect to your computer. That way you can use your MacBook Air's keyboard to type on the phone. That's as close to normal usage of the phone as you can get with a half-broken screen.\n Note that the lite version of Mocha Keyboard does not allow you to use the delete or backspace key! Type carefully!\nEdit: if you really need to use backspace with Mocha Keyboard Lite, just press Control+Shift+B, then Control+K. Don't ask me how I know this!\n", "Q: Issue when trying to convert the month number to word form in AppleScript (but only when that month contains 31 days) I have a piece of AppleScript code that converts a numerical date to that date in words.\nThe code accepts a variable that contains a date in the following format:\n\n2017_04_01\n\nThe code converts this numerical date to the following word-based format:\n\nSaturday, April 1, 2017\n\nMy code has been modified from the answer provided to this question, by user markhunte:\nApplescript date manipulation to get multiple formats\nMy code works perfectly when it is given today's date of 2017_04_01. But, for some reason, it does not work when it is given the date of day 31 of any given month.\nFor example, my code will not work if theNumericalDate is 2017_03_31.\nHere is my AppleScript code:\nset theNumericalDate to \"2017_04_01\"    \n\n-- Remove the underscores:\nset temp to AppleScript's text item delimiters\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"_\"}\nset listOfTheNumbersOfDate to text items of theNumericalDate\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to temp\n\n-- Separate each individual element:    \nset onlyTheYear to (item 1 of (listOfTheNumbersOfDate))\nset onlyTheMonth to (item 2 of (listOfTheNumbersOfDate))\nset onlyTheDay to (item 3 of (listOfTheNumbersOfDate))\n\n-- I don't want to display \"March 03\" as the date. I would prefer: \"March 3\". So, remove the first character from the day if it is a zero:\nif (character 1 of onlyTheDay is \"0\") then\n    set onlyTheDay to text 2 thru -1 of onlyTheDay\nend if\n\nset stringForShellScript to \" date -v\" & onlyTheDay & \"d -v\" & onlyTheMonth & \"m -v\" & onlyTheYear & \"y +%\"\n\nset theMonthAsWord to (do shell script (stringForShellScript & \"B\"))\n\nset theDayAsWord to (do shell script (stringForShellScript & \"A\"))\n\n\nset theDisplayDateString to (theDayAsWord & \", \" & theMonthAsWord & \" \" & onlyTheDay & \", \" & onlyTheYear)\n\nBased on some debugging that I have done, I think that the source of the issue lies in this line:\nset theMonthAsWord to (do shell script (stringForShellScript & \"B\"))\n\nCan you identify and solve the issue?\n\nI realize that I can easily accomplish the desired effect of determining the month name by implementing an if statement such as:\nif onlyTheMonth is \"01\" then\n    set theMonthAsWord to \"January\"\nelse if onlyTheMonth is \"02\" then\n    set theMonthAsWord to \"February\"\nelse if onlyTheMonth is \"03\" then\n    set theMonthAsWord to \"March\"\n...\n\nI shied away from this method because it's lengthy and unsophisticated.\nAlso, I'd still have to figure out the day of the week somehow, which is more complicated and cannot be accomplished by a simple if statement. Thus, the line:\nset theDayAsWord to (do shell script (stringForShellScript & \"A\"))\n\nwould still terminate my code when theNumericalDate ends in _31.\n\nA: Solution\nUse the following stringForShellScript:\n\"date -v\" & onlyTheMonth & \"m -v\" & onlyTheDay & \"d -v\" & onlyTheYear & \"y +%\"\nExplanation\nInterestingly enough, you need to shift the month before the day, but only if you’re going to shift the day to the 31st of the month.\n-v30d -v2m will produce February just fine, but the 31st of the month causes date to bug out (up to the version that ships with macOS Sierra 10.12.4).\nYou can shift the year at any point in the command without any issue.\nSide Notes\n\n\n*\n\n*set onlyTheDay to (onlyTheDay as integer) as string will remove any leading 0s from a number string. It’s less error-prone than parsing a string. Performance is inconsequential in this case.\n\n*You have a leading space before date. Not that it matters—just pointing it out.\n\n", "Q: Is it safe to plug my iPhone into a life fitness cardio machine? If I plug in my iPhone over USB on a life fitness machine I will be able to play media on my iPhone onto the included tv screen (Hulu/Netflix etc).\nShould I be concerned that it will install malware on my iPhone or is it safe to use?\n\nA: Your iPhone should ask whether you want to Trust This Computer if the host being connected to wants to access your data.\nYou should be relatively safe by tapping Don’t Trust, barring any unknown USB exploits in iOS. This is always the big caveat when it comes to security.\nOtherwise the platform doesn’t install anything without your consent. If the cardio machine tries to do that, you will get a popup, which you can always decline.\nThis shouldn’t keep you from streaming movies onto the screen.\n\nA: No, this should be perfectly fine. It is no different to plugging your iPhone into a dock,  speaker, music system, car stereo, etc.\nThese types of devices have offered this type of connectivity for over a decade now, originally to support iPods which had extremely high market concentration for a long time (until the iPhone came along).\n", "Q: Apple TV how to download apps I am senior, just purchased and hooked up the Apple TV, was trying to download the German TV stations but found them but was not able to open them up, it keeps saying enter your I tune password...I thought having a password for Apple goes across all accounts and I finished my account information.  Do I need to pay for the German channels, willing to do that but I am confused my apple account should be my account information across and my apple id and password? I have no interest in music so why should I have a password for my Itune account?\n\nA: There are two different German TV apps as far as I can see.\nThey are both available to download for free.\nAs for the Apple ID and iTunes account confusion; maybe this will help. I've taken a photo of my Apple ID for you:\n\n\nNow I've censored the beginning of the email addresses, but you can see that I have more than one account associated with my Apple ID; one for iCloud, one for iTunes, and one for Game Centre. \nMost people probably use the same account for everything. And you probably do too. So when it asks for your iTunes password, it's probably the exact same one that you've already provided.\nAlso; your iTunes account is not just for downloading music. It's also for downloading apps, movies & TV shows, and more (like virtual books and podcasts).\nI hope this helps, and if you have any follow up questions, feel free to ask.\n", "Q: How to repeat an entire playlist in order on iOS 10?

My Mac is running hot with the fan cutting in often. How can I diagnose what's wrong?\nPS: Some sources mentioned Activity Monitor as a tool to diagnose this, but I couldn't find the application.\n\nA: As IconDaemon mentioned in their comment, Activity Monitor is by default located in Macintosh HD > Applications > Utilities.\nHowever, since your question seems to really be about your Mac running hot with the fan cutting in often, and since you say you're not proficient with Mac OS - any pointers welcomed, I thought I'd suggest you try starting in Safe Mode and potentially also resetting the System Management Controller (SMC).\nBoot into Safe Mode\nAs a troubleshooting step you can boot your Mac into Safe Mode to see if your issue persists, both during Safe Mode and afterwards when booted normally again.\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. is your Mac still running hot, etc)\n\n*Now exit Safe Mode to restart your Mac as normal\n\n*Again, take a note of what happens (i.e. is your Mac still running hot, etc)\n\n\nOnce you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went. However, if the issue persists (especially if it persisted during Safe Mode) you can reset the SMC to see if that resolves the issue.\nReset the SMC\nYour computer's System Management Controller (SMC) is responsible for a wide range of functions, including your Mac's cooling fans, power management, battery performance, and the list goes on.

Being an avid Linux user prior to buying a MacBook Pro, I typically have several terminal tabs open at any one time. \nIn the past, crashes and reboots would generally trash my workflow, and the majority of my respective tab histories. I searched for ways to solve this problem but always came up empty; aside from various techniques that utilised combinations of tools like ssh, screen, tmux, and required a virtual private server (or similar).\nOne of my favourite things about using my MacBook Pro for writing scripts, and using CLI tools, etc; is that my terminal sessions persist beyond crashes and reboots by default. In fact, I just restored a backup from almost 2 years ago, and when I logged in for the first time, I was presented with my old desktop and three bash shells that comprised a project that I was working on all that time ago.\nI would like to know how OS X makes this feature possible. Does anybody here have insight into how it works?\n\nA: As far as I can tell, it just saves the text in each window's scrollback buffer.  It doesn't actually save the state of what was running in the terminals; it just starts a new shell after the reboot.\nAs an experiment, define a variable in your shell, and check its value:\nfoo=bar\necho $foo\n\nThen reboot, and check the variable's value again.  You'll see that it's no longer defined.\n\nA: The code to restore Terminal (actually bash sessions) is part of /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal which gets sourced through /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc for each bash session running in Terminal.\n# Resume Support: Save/Restore Shell State\n#\n# Terminal assigns each terminal session a unique identifier and\n# communicates it via the TERM_SESSION_ID environment variable so that\n# programs running in a terminal can save/restore application-specific\n# state when quitting and restarting Terminal with Resume enabled.\n#\n# The following code defines a shell save/restore mechanism. Users can\n# add custom state by defining a shell_session_save_user_state function\n# that writes restoration commands to the session file at exit. e.g.,\n# to save a variable:\n#\n#   shell_session_save_user_state() { echo MY_VAR=\"'$MY_VAR'\" >> \"$SHELL_SESSION_FILE\"; }\n#\n# During shell startup the session file is executed. Old files are\n# periodically deleted.\n#\n# The default behavior arranges to save and restore the bash command\n# history independently for each restored terminal session. It also\n# merges commands into the global history for new sessions. Because\n# of this it is recommended that you set HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to\n# larger values.\n#\n# You may disable this behavior and share a single history by setting\n# SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 0. There are some common user customizations\n# that arrange to share new commands among running shells by\n# manipulating the history at each prompt, and they typically include\n# 'shopt -s histappend'; therefore, if the histappend shell option is\n# enabled, per-session history is disabled by default. You may\n# explicitly enable it by setting SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 1.\n#\n# The implementation of per-session command histories in combination\n# with a shared global command history is incompatible with the\n# HISTTIMEFORMAT variable--the timestamps are applied inconsistently\n# to different parts of the history; therefore, if HISTTIMEFORMAT is\n# defined, per-session history is disabled by default.\n#\n# Note that this uses PROMPT_COMMAND to enable per-session history\n# the first time for each new session. If you customize PROMPT_COMMAND\n# be sure to include the previous value. e.g.,\n#\n#   PROMPT_COMMAND=\"${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND; }your_code_here\"\n#\n# Otherwise, the per-session history won't take effect until the first\n# restore.\n#\n# The save/restore mechanism is disabled if the following file exists:\n#\n#   ~/.bash_sessions_disable\n\n", "Q: Convert dynamic content to static in Numbers I have used some formulas in Numbers and I would like to change the dynamic values to static ones, so I can copy them to different sheets, without having any reference errors.\nDoes anybody know how to do that?\n\nA: Select and copy the source cells, then hit ⇧⌘V, which is the default shortcut for the Edit » Paste Formula Results menu command.\n(I assume that by dynamic value, you are referring to the the result of the calculation of an entire formula and not to the individual cell references you are using as part of the formula’s expression.

For example:\nsudo log collect --last 1d\n\n…will collect all logged messages generated during the past day into a system_logs.logarchive bundle in the current directory.  Open this bundle in Console, and you can use the full power of the app to view, search and filter the log data.\nNote that log has many other useful applications;  I suggest reading the log(1) man page.\n\nA: Short Answer\nYou can't. Well, at least not yet. That's because Console isn't working with historical data - it's working with live data instead.\nWhat you can do is use the log command in Terminal. However, I have to warn you, there appears to be a lot of 'bugs' in how the log command is working in Sierra. If you’re interested in using this command, refer to Using the logs in Sierra: some practical tips.\n[EDIT]\nI forgot to mention there is another option available to users. It's a free app called Loglogger. This is a workaround solution provided by Howard Oakley, designed to provide access to Sierra's logs that Console doesn't provide. Obviously, this requires macOS Sierra to run. It's a .zip download and includes a pretty good PDF guide on how to use it. \nNote: I have no affiliation whatsoever with the app or Howard Oakley.\nLong Answer\nOne thing that isn't obvious to users is that the version of Console included with macOS Sierra is a totally new beast (i.e. a new app, built from scratch). \nPrevious versions of Console opened All Messages by default and because of this was a great tool for troubleshooting after the fact (e.g. after a crash you could open Console and refer back to that event and what preceded it).\nmacOS Sierra's Console just doesn’t work like that. It's live log only runs when Console is open, so if you're trying to discover why your Mac shut down at midnight, it's not going to help you. \nSo, from a troubleshooting standpoint, the new Console is frustratingly limited. That's not to say it doesn't have some major improvements (such as excellent new Search functionality), but at present it's only really helpful in terms of debugging problems while working in Sierra, but fairly useless if you're wanting to analyse kernel extensions and services. It also provides a range of new tools, but since Console isn't working with historical data, these tools only work with entries captured since Console was launched (great if you're trying to troubleshoot why a specific app crashes whenever you try to perform a specific function, but useless otherwise).\nSo, what am I saying? Well, Console is a work in progress. I'd go as far as to say it's really a Beta version at present. A lot more functionality will be added as time goes by, but for now we need to be patient.\n", "Q: Camscanner-like app for Mac OSX I have some photos of notes that have been sent to me, and I would like to \"fix\" them in order to have a scanned-like pdf like the one that I get when scanning with Camscanner app (on Android or iOS).\nI've done some research but I've found only a discontinued app, doxcan.\n Is there a maintained app to do so?\n EDIT: from the comments, here's a more detailed explanation of what I need: \nI need something that allows me to \"flatten\" the photo and make it in white and black. Just like when in Camscanner you fix the corners of the document and it warps the image in order to make it as it was acquired from scanner.

I'm running on El Capitan 10.11.6, patched with the latest security updates at the time of writing. \nI recently ran a permission repair on the root volume:\nsudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --verify --standard-pkgs /\nI noticed the following log entry:\n\nWarning: SUID file 'System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/ARDAgent' has been modified and will not be repaired.\n\nIntrigued, I investigated on the binary, and landed on this page (amongst others). \nThis made me a little paranoid, so I searched again, and found this page, where the accepted answer reassures me that Disk Utility likely doesn't \"know\" the file has been patched for security reasons. \nAs I'm a little stubborn, I checked the actual ownership/permissions for that binary on my system:\n-rwsr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   1.1M Mar  6 19:15 ARDAgent\nLooks like group (wheel) and all others can execute the binary. \nMy question: is that actually safe, for an application vulnerable to arbitrary/malicious and escalated code execution?\nShouldn't I at least chmod it to a-x?\n\nA: tl;dr There does not seem to be anything unusual, or inherently unsafe, with your ARDAgent executable or its permissions. Your proposed fix will in fact make your system a tiny bit safer but might do more harm than good. It’s probably not worth it.\nWith chmod a-x, the gain in security would be really small; a software update might simply reset the flag, leaving you with a false sense of security; you’ll definitely break ARD; you might also forget to re-enable SIP, or even break future system updates.\nWhat has happened\nLet’s first summarize what has happened with respect to ARDAgent in the past.\n\n\n*\n\n*Back in 2008, the OSA libraries (a part of Mac OS X) had a root privilege escalation issue (CVE-2008-2830), which would allow attackers to execute arbitrary AppleScript using a privileged app.\n\n*One popular way to demonstrate CVE-2008-2830 was to use the ARDAgent app as a confused deputy to execute arbitrary AppleScript code with elevated privileges.\n\n*That exploit was possible because ARDAgent used the OSA libraries (containing the bug at that time) and because it is designed to run with superuser rights.\n\n*The SUID warning message by Disk Utility is very likely caused by a minor oversight introduced with OS X 10.5. The SUID warning used to bother Mac users as early as 2007; first reports appeared on the day 10.5 was released, and CVE-2008-2830 had not even surfaced. So I don’t think the warning has anything to do with the bug, the exploit, or with Apple’s subsequent patch.\n\n*At present, CVE-2008-2830 has been fixed for almost a decade. I haven’t seen reports since on any other vulnerability involving ARDAgent.\nYour threat model\nAll that history aside, let’s move on to clarify the threat scenario you most likely have in mind; feel free to edit your question in case I’m wrong.\n\n\n*\n\n*For the sake of threat modeling, let’s assume that ARDAgent 3.9.2 (the version that ships with El Capitan) has another unrelated vulnerability, one that is not publicly known as of today but might be discovered and exploited by an attacker.\n\n*In the worst case, that vulnerability would be a remote code execution (RCE) issue; an attacker might then be able to exploit the bug over the network to gain code execution (due to the bug) and  superuser privileges (due to the setuid bit) in one go. This is a somewhat realistic threat.\n\n*If the attacker already has local code execution with normal privileges, escalation can probably be achieved by the same means.\n\n*We’re not interested in an attacker that already has superuser privileges in the first place; such an attacker would have complete control over the entire system already, and would not gain anything by attacking ARDAgent.\nRisk mitigation\nIf you run chmod a-x against the executable as per your suggestion (which is only possible with SIP disabled), the attacker loses: launchd will no longer run the agent, and the local attacker won’t either. You have successfully reduced the attack surface – albeit only by a small fraction.\nImpact of the fix\nOn macOS, there are many processes with superuser privileges, be it with or without setuid. The fact that there was a bug in ARDAgent one decade ago does not make it inherently any less secure than the other programs. On average, other processes are just as likely as ARDAgent to have an undiscovered critical vulnerability.\nYou will lose Apple’s remote desktop features (if you have them enabled). You might also run into a random future macOS update failing because the flags might have become part of a pre-update signature assertion (not unlike the SUID warning a decade ago, but this time Apple might choose to make it an error). Chances are you’ll have forgotten your fix by then so you’d have to reinstall.\nEven if the system updates work, they might simply reset the execution bit when shipping the next version of ARDAgent, leaving you with a false sense of security.\nThere’s also the risk of forgetting to re-enable SIP (which will introduce much more risk than you have just mitigated). And lastly, there’s a small risk of making an inconspicuous little mistake while chmodding, for example rwsrw-rw- – which means every user gains no less than root privileges for free.\nAlternatives\nA few suggestions to mitigate risk in a safer way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reduce the attack surface by disabling services you do not need. While this might not always protect against escalation attacks (an attacker with local code execution might just launch the agent directly), it will help prevent RCE.\n\n*Re-enable SIP if it’s disabled, and leave it enabled.\n\n*Search for, and remove, non-system files owned by root that have setuid/setgid bits set without good reason. If you absolutely need to leave the bits enabled, make sure the files are never group- or world-writable.\n", "Q: How can adding a new user bypass full Disk Encryption? I've opted for disk encryption during install of El Capitan (v10.11.6) on my Macbook Air.\nLogged in from my admin account (not root), I added a new user to manage a second iTunes account (which I thoughtlessly created and tremendously complicated my iPhone-Macbook activities).\nAmazingly, this user has been added to the first login screen after restart (see image). Logging in from this screen, I can bypass the disk encryption password, view the System and User directories, and run apps installed at the root level.\nHow can adding a new user bypass full Disk Encryption?\n\n\nA: Normally, when you set up full-disk encryption on the startup volume, you use FileVault, which integrates the disk encryption with the user accounts, so any (enabled) user can start the OS and unlock the disk. It appears that what you've done is encrypt the startup volume some other way, giving it a disk password rather than integrating with the user accounts. But when you create a new user account, it goes ahead and sets that account up FileVault-style, giving it the ability to unlock the disk at startup.\nNot what you wanted? You can remove that user from the unlock list with the fdesetup command:\nsudo fdesetup remove userToDisable\n\nwhere userToDisable is the new user's account name (aka short name). Note that sudo will prompt for your admin password, and it won't echo as you type.\n", "Q: Best practices for syncing two Macs using Sierra I have three children who share two desktop Macs.  Each kid has her own account on each computer, but up to now none of them has had an Apple ID (they do not have phones or mobile devices, although they do have old-school digital cameras).  Until recently the computers were both running Mountain Lion, and keeping each kid's personal files and photos in sync between the two machines was an ongoing headache involving USB thumb drives and lots of manual copying.\nSo I've decided to take the plunge and upgrade both machines to Sierra, create Apple IDs for each kid, and use iCloud to sync their Desktops, Documents, and Photos.  This seemed like the simplest way to make sure that each kid's account on each computer would automatically stay in sync with the corresponding account on the other computer.\nI'm wondering if people with experience with this setup (or a similar one) can share any best practices with me before I go all-in on this.  For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I correct that this setup will work as intended?\n\n*Will syncing of one user continue to run in the background if a second user logs in to the same machine?  (Presumably not if the 1st user logs out, but what if they stay logged in while the second account becomes active?)\n\n*If I link all the accounts on both computers to iCloud, will I end up with duplicate copies of files that currently reside on both machines?  Or will the syncing process recognize when two files are copies of one another?\n\n*Would it be better to upgrade one machine, link all of the accounts on that machine to iCloud, then do a clean install on the second machine and create & sync new accounts on that machine to iCloud?\n\n*If I notice that files don't seem to be syncing automatically is there a way to force a sync?\n\n\nA: I am going to try answering per question, except the first two. So here goes my 5p: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Am I correct that this setup will work as intended?\n  \n*Will syncing of one user continue to run in the background if a second user logs in to the same machine? (Presumably not if the 1st\n  user logs out, but what if they stay logged in while the second\n  account becomes active?)\n  \n\nYes, for both. \nAlso in addition, for best practices and keep each user's file separate, create the Documents, Pictures, etc folders inside and iCloud Drive. Now ask each child to put all their stuff in that folder. \nIf did not do that, it will still be stored inside the local machines' ~/Users/ folder. \n\nIf I link all the accounts on both computers to iCloud, will I end up with duplicate copies of files that currently reside on both machines? Or will the syncing process recognize when two files are copies of one another?\n\nDo you mean using the Auto upload feature? \n\nWould it be better to upgrade one machine, link all of the accounts on that machine to iCloud, then do a clean install on the second machine and create & sync new accounts on that machine to iCloud?\n\nIf you are moving all of User1's docs to their iCloud Drive, it does not matter. \n\nIf I notice that files don't seem to be syncing automatically is there\n  a way to force a sync?\n\nNot that I know of\n", "Q: Replace a string in directory name using a variable i have a script set up to make a new directoy in folder based off a variable named for another directory that goes like this:\nstr=\"/home/folder/test\"\nbase=\"$(basename $str)\"\n\nmkdir -p \"/home/folder2/${base}\"\n\nWhat im trying to do now is find and replace a string in this varible when it makes the new folder.\nExample, i have:\n/Home/Album-Artist[FLAC] \n\nassigned to the variable.  When i use mkdir to make the new directory, I want to find and replace \"FLAC\" with \"V0\" so in the new folder it will be\n/Home/Album-Artist[V0]\n\n\nA: Solution\nReplace your line:\nbase=\"$(basename $str)\"\n\nwith:\nbase=\"$(basename $str | sed 's/FLAC/V0/')\"\n\nor, if you want the [ and ] brackets to become part of the search pattern:\nbase=\"$(basename $str | sed 's/\\[FLAC\\]/[V0]/')\"\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*The | (or pipe) character essentially means “take the result and feed it into the next program”.\n\n*The sed (stream editor) command takes the input, applies commands to it, and prints the result. For example, the s/FLAC/V0/ command in sed means “for each input line, search for FLAC and replace it with V0 (but no more than once)”.\n\n*sed uses regular expressions instead of fixed search patterns. That means you need to escape certain characters; hence, my last example says \\[ and \\] in the search pattern (instead of just [ and ]).\n\nA: In bash itself you could call sed, perl, python, swift or other languages.\nIf you're looking to level up in bash, try:\n${var%pattern}\n\nThe % strips a pattern from the back of the variable so in one line you could srip out the ending and tack on the new.\nnew=${base%\\[FLAC\\]}\"[V0]\" ## [FLAC] to [V0] with \\ to escape []  \n\nMore clear is the search and replace functionality assuming no artist or album would ever be FLAC and get matched. The tail end search above helps for that edge case, but is harder to read the intent.\nnew=${base/FLAC/V0}\n\n", "Q: Random shutdown after minutes for macbook pro 15\" 2014 I'm having this problem driving me crazy since some days.\nMy macbook just turns off after around 1 minute of being logged in.\n\n\n*\n\n*I reset completely macOS thinking it would be a Software Issue but nothing.\n\n*I though it was an hardware issue but if I use the guest safari mode it doesn't happend, or also if I install the OS in recovery (which lasts 40 mins or more) I have no shutdowns... so can it be hardware?\n\n*CPU temp and fans are ok, same with battery.\n\n*Bluetooth and WIFI are turned off thinking it was a driver problem, but nothing\n\n*No useful logs in console and all ok running hardware test\n\n*Reset SMC and PRAM\n\n\nHere's the latest logs before shutdown: https://gist.github.com/dariobanfi/6464faed360005041d9cc1a6895c1712\nI am getting crazy... any idea what could cause this??\n\nA: It's not clear to me what I reset completely macOS means?

I saw some command line with sudo for using on macOS. I have seen it even used for NPM installs. I am under the impression that using sudo is discouraged for macOS.\nWhen do I use sudo in macOS?\n\nA: sudo is not discouraged on MacOS it is much to be preferred to the alternative which is to su to another user especially root. It is discouraged to set up root so you can login or su to it.\nNormally you can only write to files in directories you have write acces to.\nIf you need to write to a file that is not ina directory owned by you your will not usually have permission. e.g. /usr/local/bin can only be written to by root.\nIf you need to copy a file to a protected directory - as the npm install does you have to ask for more privileges. Adding sudo before a command means that the command is run as if root was running it anmd so the command can write to /usr/local/bin\nsudo can be used to run as any user by using the -u parameter. \n\nA: sudo originally meant superuser do (and then got generalized to \"substitute user do\"), so what you are asking is when do I have to use the admin account.\nWell, the answer is simple, when the installation doesn't work without extended access rights (primarily because files need to get written into directories not writable by standard users), just type sudo !! to rerun the command but with the admin account. \nPS: Some npm package will need sudo, some won't, so there is no clear answer to your question, but just use it when you think the admin right will be needed\n\nA: Using sudo is not discouraged especially on Macs. \nIn general, you should not use sudo when not absolutely necessary. This goes for all platforms, not just Macs.\nsudo is used to execute one or more commands with elevated privileges - perhaps even super user (root) privileges. Used sparingly as needed it is a vital tool for every systems administrator.\n", "Q: Dock icons changing sometimes I noticed that some app icons changing sometimes with same blank like icon. Right now Sublime Text icon changed. Couple days ago it was happened on Safari. How can I prevent this? What will can cause this?\n \n\nA: Your best bet is to reset and restart the Dock. Note you will need to re-add any non-default icons (i.e. apps) that you've added to the Dock - so you may want to take a screenshot of your Dock as a reminder of what you had there. (Or start afresh and only add things as you actually use them).\nTo reset and restart the Dock, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*Press and hold the option key down\n\n*Now go to the Go menu\n\n*Select the Library option to open the User's Library folder. You can let go of the option key now.\n\n*Go to the Preferences folder (i.e. within the Library folder)\n\n*Find and move the com.apple.dock.plist file to the Trash\n\n*Now open Terminal (usually located in Applications > Utilities)\n\n*Enter this command killall -KILL Dock\n\n*Press enter\nThis should resolve the issue. As mentioned previously, you will need to re-add non-default apps back to the Dock.\n", "Q: Windows 10 install very slow on Mid 2012 MacBook Pro I made a Win10 USB installer using the media creation tool on my PC and I have a SSD in a drive caddy which replaced my DVD drive. \nI want to clean install Win10 to this SSD but the Win10 installer takes hours - no joke - to boot up and then it takes forever to start the setup.\nI already installed it before but when booting from the disk after install it just ends in a boot loop. The USB drive should be working fine I don't think it's the problem. And the SSD in the caddy also works fine. \nAny idea why this is happening and how I can install Win10?\n\nA: It had something to do with the problem I solved here:   HGST 1tb in mid 2012 mbpro not working in sata bay but drive seems fine.  After I solved that issue, the Windows install worked normally again\n", "Q: What is the ATC service advertised in Bonjour? While browsing for services in my local network with Bonjour, I notice that my MacBook Pro provides the _atc._tcp. service. However I couldn't find a description for such a service from the canonical list of macOS services nor inside the DNS-SD registry.\nThe question is, what is that service? How to use it?\n\nA: The _atc._tcp. service is/was the Shared iTunes Library service.\nI'm out and about at the moment, but when I get a chance I will update this answer with some sort of link/source to back this up.\n[EDIT]\nI haven't yet had a chance to have a thorough look for a source, although I did do a quick Google search and found a reference to the _atc._tcp. service at this MacRumors discussion. In it you'll see the 10th comment (by priitv8) states:\n\nFor comparison, I've included a screenshot from my Shared iTunes Library service (_atc._tcp.).\n\nAlso, it occurred to me that you may want to download Bonjour Browser and see if that sheds any more light on this for you. It's an old app but works well (although I haven't used it in macOS Sierra - not sure what you're using).\nAs an aside, the list of Bonjour service types used in Mac OS X you linked to is not an exhaustive list. It was only a list of common Bonjour service types used in Mac OS X and hasn't been updated since July 2004.\n", "Q: Recent calls suddenly changed to add +1 for US calls, which messed-up all my contacts I do not know if this has anything to do with the problem - I recently returned from a China trip and all my call history got changed so the phone numbers are now displayed with \"+1\" in front of them. More importantly, when my existing contacts call me the Caller ID does not display their name anymore, but only a number with \"+1\" and in a small font below \"Maybe: [Contact Name]\".\nOf course, I can select \"Add to Existing Contact\", but do I have to update all my contacts now? The form with +1 is inconvenient to me and I would like to change it back. Is there a simple fix?\n\nA: My wife fixed it - told me to turn the iPhone OFF and then back ON. Apparently this procedure should be done before attempting to resolve any issue with iPhone.\n", "Q: Exporting all file locations that could not be found on iTunes I'm running Windows 7 64 bit and am using iTunes. I previously had an issue where when iTunes organized my media library (after transferring all my music over), the file names were auto-truncated to 40 characters. This effectively broke a large portion of my library.\nTo see all the songs that were broken I created a smart playlist of \"dead\" songs and exported that playlist information. Unfortunately, the dead locations did not get exported when I chose File -> Export Playlist, only the other metadata was exported. This is strange because when I actually select Get Info on the song, I can see the file path it is looking for.\nIs there some way to get this information exported? I'm trying to write a script to auto-rename the files it finds to the correct (longer) file names.\nEdit:\nHere is an example:\nLet's say I have a song that is broken in iTunes (the file path is incorrect). In iTunes this appears with the correct metadata. I can check the metadata by right clicking on the song in question and selecting Get Info.\nMy song structure looks like this:\nArtist: DJ Rashad\nSong: Last Winter\nAlbum: Double Cup\nGenre: Footwork\nLocation: C:\\My Music\\iTunes\\DJ Rashad\\Double Cup\\DJ Rashad - Last Winter.mp3\n\nIn this case the Location attribute is incorrect, which is fine. But I still need this data when I export the information about the track. So I drag this track into its own playlist and export the information via File -> Export Playlist. I expect to see the structure above but instead what appears in the corresponding file is the following:\nArtist: DJ Rashad\nSong: Last Winter\nAlbum: Double Cup\nGenre: Footwork\nLocation:\n\nSince iTunes does not find the location, it exports an empty location. Since I am writing a script to correct some broken paths, I do not want an empty location. I want the last known location of the file (the one that is displayed when viewing Get Info). How can I export the complete information under the Location attribute?\n\nA: suggest you go a different path.\nfirst remove all the broken links in itunes\nCan I easily view all songs that iTunes can't locate in Finder?\nthen drag&drop your complete lib back in itunes (there wont be duplicates, if you drag files that are already linked/imported.)\ndone\n", "Q: How to generate an automatic bash/script I'm new to terminal and unix like systems.

What I would like to do is something like this: ls -lT /Desktop/Old_avi_to_conv/*.avi and have the date and time for each file as time-date parameter for the touch command.\nHow can I accomplish this?\nEdit:\nI hope the explanation makes it clearer. This is the scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two folders on the desktop containing video files.\n\n*one (folder_1) contains the original files (.avi)\n\n*the second (folder_2) contains converted files (.mp4)\n\n*all the files in the second folder have a newer sequential date, since the conversion tool made worked through a list of files. \n\n*I need to take the date/time stamp from the original file, in the first folder and assign it to the converted file in the second folder.\n\n*each file in the first folder has a different date, possibly days and months apart.\n\n*the files in the second folder have the same names than the ones in the first folder, except for the file suffix, e.g.: \nfolder_1/CIMG_0001.avi is the original of folder_2/CIMG_0001.mp4\nfolder_1/PIC_0003.avi is the original of folder_2/PIC_0003.mp4\nfolder_1/PIC_0015.avi is the original of folder_2/PIC_0015.mp4\nfolder_1/CIMG_003.avi id the original of folder_2/CIMG_0003.mp4\n\nA: You need to process each mp4 file individually:\ncd folder_2\nfor m in *.mp4; do\n    a=\"${m%.mp4}\".avi\n    if [[ -r \"/path/to/folder_1/$a\" ]]; then\n         echo touch -r \"/path/to/folder_1/$a\" \"$m\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nRun once to verify that the generated output makes sense, then remove the echo and rerun.\nPS: This assumes that the names of the video files don't contain the string \".mp4\" as such.\n", "Q: I blocked someone from contacting me on iPhone. I then sent an angry message to them that I regret. Did they see the message? I know this sounds petty. It is. Regardless, I must know the answer. I was angry with the person I have an intimate relationship. I blocked him on my iPhone, in his contact profile, so that he could not contact me. I then sent him a message while I was still upset, a message I truly regret. Did he receive the message?? I still have him blocked because I don't think either of us are ready to talk. \n\nA: Blocking someone and being able to send them messages are two different things:\n\nYes, you have only blocked seeing that they called or texted you. Blocking has nothing to do with outgoing calls or texts.\n\nYour iMessage has most likely been delivered to, and displayed on, one or more of the recipient’s iOS and macOS devices.\n", "Q: Pass a variable (folder pathway) to AppleScript in Automator I am trying to pass a variable that has been set in Automator to an AppleScript within Automator.

The variable is needed elsewhere in the Automator workflow in addition to passing it to the AppleScript.\n\nA: When using on run {input, parameters}, input is a list, and as such you need to change the following line of your code:\nset thefolder to (input as text)\n\nTo:\nset thefolder to (item 1 of input)\n\nThat will fix the Can’t get every file of ... error.\nAlso, while you didn't state the complete settings of the Get Value of Variable action, I'll assume that under Options, you have checked the [√] Ignore this action's input checkbox to unlink it from the preceding Set Value of Variable action.

What is(are) the difference(s) between them? \nSubcommands:\n    bootstrap       Bootstraps a domain or a service into a domain.\n    bootout         Tears down a domain or removes a service from a domain.\n    enable          Enables an existing service.\n    disable         Disables an existing service.\n    uncache         Removes the specified service name from the service cache.\n    kickstart       Forces an existing service to start.\n    attach          Attach the system's debugger to a service.\n    debug           Configures the next invocation of a service for debugging.\n    kill            Sends a signal to the service instance.\n    blame           Prints the reason a service is running.\n    print           Prints a description of a domain or service.\n    print-cache     Prints information about the service cache.\n    print-disabled  Prints which services are disabled.\n    plist           Prints a property list embedded in a binary (targets the Info.plist by default).\n    procinfo        Prints port information about a process.\n    hostinfo        Prints port information about the host.\n    resolveport     Resolves a port name from a process to an endpoint in launchd.\n    limit           Reads or modifies launchd's resource limits.\n    runstats        Prints performance statistics for a service.\n    examine         Runs the specified analysis tool against launchd in a non-reentrant manner.\n    config          Modifies persistent configuration parameters for launchd domains.\n    dumpstate       Dumps launchd state to stdout.\n    dumpjpcategory  Dumps the jetsam properties category for all services.\n    reboot          Initiates a system reboot of the specified type.\n    bootshell       Brings the system up from single-user mode with a console shell.\n    load            Bootstraps a service or directory of services.\n    unload          Unloads a service or directory of services.\n    remove          Unloads the specified service name.\n    list            Lists information about services.\n    start           Starts the specified service.\n    stop            Stops the specified service if it is running.\n    setenv          Sets the specified environment variables for all services within the domain.\n    unsetenv        Unsets the specified environment variables for all services within the domain.\n    getenv          Gets the value of an environment variable from within launchd.\n    bsexec          Execute a program in another process' bootstrap context.\n    asuser          Execute a program in the bootstrap context of a given user.\n    submit          Submit a basic job from the command line.\n    managerpid      Prints the PID of the launchd controlling the session.\n    manageruid      Prints the UID of the current launchd session.\n    managername     Prints the name of the current launchd session.\n    error           Prints a description of an error.\n    variant         Prints the launchd variant.\n    version         Prints the launchd version.\n    help            Prints the usage for a given subcommand.\n\n\nA: Apple rewrote launchd in OS X Yosemite (10.10)\nAs far as I understand it, they added bootstrap | bootout as replacements for load | unload. load | unload are currently listed under LEGACY SUBCOMMANDS in the launchctl manual.\nThe main difference when you're just trying to load or unload an agent/daemon is that bootstrap | bootout forces you to be explicit about the target domain that the agent/daemon will be loaded into.\nCheck out this great Blog Post about some of the changes to the launchctl syntax in the OS X Yosemite launchd rewrite for more details about everything I just touched on.\n", "Q: Large UI on 4k Resolution I am using a Mac pro with MacOS Sierra 10.12.4\nWhen using a Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 at 4k, the UI scale gets really large.\n\nOn 2k the ui looks as it should.\n\nIs there any reason why the UI would become that large at 4k? \nIt's not possible to properly work like that.\nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro early 2013 so I have to drive my Cintiq Pro 16 at 2k.\nI think on 4k, Mac OS knows scales UI bigger, because otherwise it would be too small (imagine those 2k Interface Elements at about half the size).\nIts probably an issue with the Wacom Driver, that makes it impossible to scale the Interface at 2k.\n\nDo you have scaling options for the Cintiq on 4k?

Note that I saved it as Translate with Google Translate and this is what shows on the Services menu and context menu when I have selected text that I want to translate.\n\n\nAppleScript Code:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    set textToTranslate to item 1 of input as string\n    set windowName to \"Google Translate\"\n    set targetURL to \"https://translate.google.com/\"\n\n    tell current application\n        do shell script \"open -a \" & quoted form of windowName\n    end tell\n\n    tell application \"Google Translate\"\n        repeat while (loading) of front browser window\n            delay 0.5\n        end repeat\n        if (get title of front window) does not contain windowName then\n            open location targetURL\n            repeat while (loading) of front browser window\n                delay 0.5\n            end repeat\n        end if\n        tell front browser window\n            activate\n            try\n                do JavaScript \"document.getElementById('source').value = \\\"\" & textToTranslate & \"\\\";\"\n            on error\n                set the clipboard to textToTranslate as string\n                delay 1\n                activate\n                do JavaScript \"document.getElementById('source').value = ''; document.getElementById('source').focus();\"\n                tell application \"System Events\"\n                    keystroke \"v\" using command down\n                end tell\n            end try\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\nend run\n\n\nNote: My Translate with Google Translate Automator Service tries to use JavaScript to change the value of the source text area, as this is IMO a better method then literally programmatically pasting the text to translate to the source text area, however if it can't, it then copies the selected text to the clipboard and then pastes it to the source text area. Before pasting, via programmatically pressing ⌘V, JavaScript is used to both clear the source text area and set focus to it, so the paste will occur as intended in the right location.\nThe use of do shell script \"open -a \" ... is necessary because a Fluid App with default Preferences, one created with Fluid, by default when opened from the macOS UI shows its Home Page. However, when programmatically opened via AppleScript, example case, tell application \"Google Translate\" to activate, only the Dock Tile appears, no browser window, i.e. no Home Page is displayed. This is in part why I originally coded it the way I did. However, since your comment, I found out that if I programmatically opened via AppleScript using do shell script \"open -a \" ..., it opens with a browser window, not just the Dock Tile and as such was able to recode the Service differently because the use of do shell script \"open -a \" ... also would bring a minimize window back up without the need to account for that with additional coding.\nHopefully the new code will eliminate two Google Translate tabs from appearing when starting from a closed state. (Although depending on timings, it may occasionally happen.)\n", "Q: Auto Unlock on Mac doesn't work if iPhone is in range For some odd reason Auto Unlock on my Mac doesn't work unless my iPhone is out of range, in Airplane Mode, or off.

Please Help.\n\nA: If anyone is still interested I have found the solution for audio on MBP 2011 Windows 10 UEFI installs - it has taken me 4 years to figure out. I was given the answer from a tutorial only adjacently related -here:\nhttps://egpu.io/forums/pc-setup/fix-dsdt-override-to-correct-error-12/\nessentially what we knew was that windows didn't 'see' the correct audio devices when booted in pure efi-\nThe part that was frustrating to me was that many users like myself have lots of UEFI installs on their 2011 MBP and those OS's have no problem 'seeing' the HD audio controller -\nSo what was windows doing different?\nI had messed around with mm commands in a UEFI shell (The shell provided in the rEFIt package) to no avail*\nI had tried to pass SETPCI commands from grub into Windows 10- no luck*\nA quote from the link above got my brain spinning\n\"A Windows system's DSDT table root bridge definition (ACPI PNP0A08 or PNP0A03) is usually confined to a reserved 32-bit space (under 4GB) budgeted to be large enough to host the notebook's PCIe devices. A watermark TOLUD value is then set and locked in the system firmware. Windows OS honors the root bridge definition and will allocate PCIe devices within it. macOS ignores the root bridge constraints as too does Linux when booted with the 'pci=noCRS' parameter. Neither of those OS require a DSDT override and can allocate freely in the huge 64-bit PCIe address space\"\nSo Windows 'honors' the root bridge and OSX and linux disregard it --hmmm interesting.\nAs someone who also deals in hackintoshes I am very aware of DSDT's and how editing them can help get OSX running on home brew PC hardware- I had played around with installing Clover (the UEFI bootloader almost synonymous with Hackintoshes) on USB thumb drives and putting the DSDT from my MBP 2011 in the /Clover/ACPI/Windows folder - still nothing-- I thought that pointing windows to a DSDT would be enough.......\nA side note is that there are people who have 'bricked' their real Macs when using clover, I have never had that issue personally  (a sub-link in the link above describes such a situation)*\nIf you follow the guide and make a modified DSDT (one that add 'qwords' to the dwords section) you can test it in two ways-\n\nI used Maciasl to extract and edit my DSDT to add a 'Qword' section - I placed the DSDT in two locations /EFI/Clover/ACPI/Patched [not sure if that one matters] & /EFI/Clover/ACPI/Windows\nholding ALT/option during bootup I selected \"EFI Boot\" from the USB clover and booted into Clover\nfor the exact Clover configuration send me a message\nAfter booting into windows the sound card was immediately working (this was because I had installed the cirrus logic drivers from bootcamp 4) - the display audio driver in device manager had an exclamation point but I was able to install the display audio driver from intel's driver support for the i7 2470m CPU in this machine-\n\nI also looked at device manager via 'by resources' and saw that a new entry 'Large memory with an address range appeared\n\nAnd low and behold the address range for the 'large memory section' contained the range for the hd audio controller\n\nI then wanted to see if the method described in the initial link posted above where you force that memory map into the registry and turn on 'test signing' worked --\nit did, which allowed me to boot directly into windows without the help of clover --\n*NOTE: when I tested the registry method I skipped the first few steps since I already had a modified DSDT- I did need to create the 'C:\\dsdt folder and extract the windows binaries to that folder - but I did not use their acpi dump nor compiler (I check for errors and compiled my dsdt in Maciasl in OSX)\nI would gladly go more in depth but I doubt there are many more who need this information- just glad to have figured it out without the BIOS emulation of bootcamp- going to test this method on other 'pre 2013' Macs with non complient UEFI bios'\n\nA: For anyone stumbling upon this thread, some answers here are misleading.\nYou can install Win10 on a Late 2011 Macbook Pro.\nBut when you install it in EFI mode, you will have problems with sound - this can't be solved with drivers, as older (pre-2013) Macbook UEFI will simply not expose the sound card interface to Windows. You will also encounter problems with discrete graphics driver (eg. you can't use hardware acceleration or adjust screen brightness).\nThe easiest way to get it to work is to reinstall Win 10 in Legacy/BIOS/Hybrid MBR mode that Bootcamp offers.

My guess is no.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set frontmostProcess to first process where it is frontmost\n    delay 0.01\n    key code 121\nend tell\n\n\nA: As I mentioned in my comment, what you're trying to do is a system wide event that you want activated by a keyboard shortcut. These factors combine to reduce the overall response time. \nTo help reduce the response time, you could try using a different script to achieve the same thing and test that for a while to see if it runs more efficiently. \nYour current Apple Script (based on what you've linked to in your comment to me) is:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set frontmostProcess to first process where it is frontmost\n    delay 0.01\n    key code 121\nend tell\n\nBasically the above is designed to have the frontmost app to do a Page Down (key code 121) after a delay of 0.01.\nHowever, you could try this one line code instead:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke (key code 121)\n\nThis should achieve the same outcome and be more efficient. You could test it for a while and see if that's what you find. Of course, to page up you would just change the key code from 121 to 116.\nHowever, as I mentioned previously, the fact you need to activate this via a keyboard shortcut will add to the time it takes for the whole thing to run. That is, you need a keyboard shortcut to be registered that then runs an Automator Service that in turn runs the script, so this isn't going to be as efficient as say just using the built-in keyboard shortcut for Page Up and Page Down.\nRegardless, you may find that if the script is more efficient that it reduces the response time enough to satisfy you.\n"]
