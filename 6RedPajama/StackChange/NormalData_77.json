["Q: Can I use both Thunderbolt ports to get higher resolution/framerate I have a mid-2014 Macbook Pro (Iris Pro 1536) with an AOC U2790B. It can only run 4k at very low framerate so I downscale it.\nI seem to recall reading a long time ago about using both Thunderbolt ports at once to drive a single monitor. Is that possible with my setup?\n\nA: The problem is not the speed of the connection, a Thunderbolt 2 port has the bandwidth for a display size and refresh rate of at least 4K@60Hz or 5K@30Hz.  Using two Thunderbolt connections to a single display requires a display that supports this, and this is a feature that I recall was short lived as there are now cable and connector standards readily available for supporting 8K displays with refresh rates of at least 60Hz.\nThe problem is not a lack of bandwidth.  The problem is that the GPU in the laptop doesn't support more than 4K@30Hz.  To get better than this means adding an external GPU, or getting a new computer.\n", "Q: How can I best configure this hard drive? I have a Mac Mini with two hard drives inside. The 1st one has an OS installed, and the files I work from.\nBut I wanted to have the second one be used partly for storage, and partly have an OS installed in case the first HD crashes.\nI'm imagining that if my main drive fails one day, I will be able to keep working uninterrupted by updating drive 2 with Time Machine.\nHowever in the meanwhile, I'd like to use Drive 2 for storage (while booting from drive 1). I found this article, but it doesn't really say if this scenario would let the user use the rest of the partition for storage if the computer is booted from another drive.\nDoes this sound like a logical plan, and how would I format and instal the second drive?\n\nA: You can partition the 2nd drive leaving ample room for the system software. Then you can install the system onto the 2nd drive or clone drive 1 onto drive 2 and have a backup of everything on drive one. Cloning allows you to use the 2nd drive as a startup drive. The downside to cloning is that you copy the entire contents from drive 1 to drive 2.  Installing the system software avoids this problem. But as @Steve Chambers said, if you just install the system and hard drive 1 fails, you need some way to get the data off drive 1. If you clone you have the data from disk 1. But it will become dated the longer you use disk 1. I'd suggest you install just the system on Disk 2 and you should be able to use the other partition for whatever you need.\n", "Q: How to restore default folders for Desktop, Downloads and Documents? I deleted the \"Desktop\", \"Documents\" and \"Downloads\" folders and emptied the Trash.\nI don't need to restore the contents of these folders because everything is already backed up on my external drive, but now the folder themselves are not appearing or able to be added/restored. Nothing can be added to the Desktop, nothing can be downloaded because I've deleted these folders.\nHow can I restore or create these deleted folders?\n\n\n\nA: If they don't exist, Documents and Downloads - just create a folder with those names in your home directory. I think you can do the same for the Desktop directory. Make a Desktop folder in your home directory.\n", "Q: temporarily disabling a printer I have a printer that only works from the office and not from home.

In the guide it was stated that I should create a separate partition for Big Sur, and shouldn't install it on my current one. I had my SSD Called \"Macintosh SSD\" and later I created a partition named \"Macintosh SSD Big Sur\" of size 40GBs. After installation I wanted to clear the \"Macintosh SSD\" of size 80GBs(with old MacOS) and merge it with the new \"Macintosh SSD Big Sur\".\nThis is what I initially had after formatting partition with the old MacOS\n\nSo, I used the command sudo diskutil apfs deleteContainer disk3 after which I had (free space) in /dev/disk1\n\nI want to extend that 39.6GB partition which free space of 80,1GB but all the commands I googled do not work:((\nCould you please guide me on what I should do now?\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: Your free space is before your disk2. The start position of a partition is fixed, and you can only resize the partition by changing the end position. You should back up your data, erase the disk as one partition and restore from backup.\n\nA: Since the relevant space used on disk1s3 is sufficiently smaller than disk1s2, you can clone Macintosh SDD Big Sur from disk1s3 to disk1s2. After this is done, you can remove disk1s3 and expand disk1s2 to contain the space occupied by disk1s3.\nCloning can be accomplished by using the Disk Utility to restore to the container occupied by disk1s2. When restoring, choose to restore from Macintosh SDD Big Sur. The proper files will also be cloned from the Data, Preboot and Recovery volumes. You will need to run the Disk Utility from macOS Recovery. A Big Sur version of macOS Recovery may be required. In other words, restart the Mac and immediately hold down the Command and R keys.\n", "Q: Can I open a PDF file that is possibly locked on mac? I have one book that I purchased online, and the company seems to allow users to read the book only through their app (which I'm not 100% sure, but the error message below implies it).\nHowever, I could no longer access the account so I could not read it on app. The book data is under ~/Library/ApplicationSupport as PDF file. There is another file with an extension .dat on the same directory.\nBut when I tried opening the PDF file, the dialog appeared, saying it may be damaged or use a file format that preview doesn't recognize. I tried installing Adobe Acrobat Reader but there appears the same error message.\nIs there any way to read the PDF file, possibly on iBooks?\n\nA: Some vendors of PDFs do encrypt them in third-party DRM, which requires the use of a special reader, or a plug-in for Adobe Reader/Acrobat. (Such as FileOpen).\nRealistically, you need to ask the vendor about whether the files they supply can be read on standard PDF readers, and what to do about recovering access to your account.\nIt's arguable whether such files are 'true' PDFs. The first four characters of a 'normal' PDF file should be %PDF, so you can open a PDF file in a text editor and see if the files you've found are indeed PDFs. (Of course, it's possible for them to be incomplete or damaged even if they have this header.)\nI'm not sure whether iBooks can handle DRM: It's likely just the same PDF engine as is used in Preview.\n", "Q: Is there a way to prevent predictive text from learning what the user typed I want to prevent predictive text from being stored on the iOS device. Is there a way to do it? If I turn off predictive text, the app doesn't show the predictive text toolbar, but it still learns the text. I know if the we implement a custom keyboard, predictive text does not get saved to the dictionary on device. I was wondering if there was another option than implementing a custom keyboard\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not possible.  The only remedy is to reset the Keyboard Dictionary (Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset Keyboard Dictionary) and that too, is quite limited.  It’s an all-or-nothing scenario meaning if you accidentally added a misspelled word, you can’t remove just that one, all your custom words must go.\nThis is definitely something you want to submit feedback for:  https://apple.com/feedback/iphone\nThere is a potential solution, however, if you're willing to use a 3rd party keyboard - Microsoft Swiftkeys.  I've been evaluating it for a while now and have found it quite capable.  Specific to your question, it has the ability to delete individual auto-predicted words instead of having to remove the entire dictionary. It's contingent upon signing into the swiftkeys account so that it can back-up and store your dictionary and settings.\n\nSwiftkeys is free with in-app purchases which seem to only be the themes.  So, if you stick to just the included themes, you won't be out of pocket anything for this app.\nBear in mind that this is a third-party keyboard and will require \"Full Access\" for full functionality.  This means that any third party keyboard can see and send what you type back to the developers.  Google's keyboard, while strong on features, seems to be a privacy nightmare.  While I don't trust Microsoft completely, I trust them much more than I do Google or other unknown app devs.\nWhy does my Microsoft SwiftKey Keyboard need Full Access?\n", "Q: Why Travel Time is not available for all calendars? I have two calendars set on my iPhone : one with CalDAV and another one with Exchange.\nWhen I create an appointment in my CalDAV calendar, the « Travel Time » field is available, and I can select an address in the « Location field » :\n\n\nBut when I create an appointment in my Exchange calendar, the « Travel Time » field disappeared and I am unable to set a location.\n\n\nAny idea of why Travel Time and Location are not available for all types of calendar ?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: It depends on what the server has been configured for.  Travel Time is not something that is configured (normally) or by default in an Exchange Server.  Same thing for the Location field, however, by Default it's on.  On my particular Exchange server (hosted by MS365), Location is available by default.\nCheck with the admin of the Exchange server as to why those features aren't available.\n\nA: I think that it is one of those things that Apple's calendar does not support out of the box. And considering that MS does not either...\nThe (free) MS Outlook client has a location option but the \"travel time\" option is not available just that location field for the Calendar Event.\nFrom what I can find MS does not provide that feature out of the box in anything.\nThere might be a 3rd party add-on that does this but I am not aware of one.\n", "Q: Getting Latest Version of Swift I’m starting to learn Swift, and have tried the Swift shell.

Spotify auto-launches even if I tell it not to from within its own preferences.\nIt does not seem to be started through any of the \"classic\" means of auto starting a program - i.e. Login Items or user or global launch agents.\nIs there any way to turn off this sort of 'modern login items' in general? (official name: shared helper applications)\nExtra points for preventing auto-launching of any apps, especially after MacOS crashed.\n\nA: There are several ways that programs can automatically start in macOS:\nFirst check \"Login Items\" which are found in System Preferences after clicking the \"Users & Groups\" icons. I understand that you have already checked here and did not find Spotify.\nAnother possibility is that Spotify have been set to open at login from the dock. You can right-click the Spotify icon in the dock, and then in the Options menu make sure that \"Open at login\" is not enabled.\nSimilarly if you have left Spotify running when you power down the Mac then by default the app and open windows will be opened again after rebooting. You can avoid this by ensuring that you close Spotify before logging out or rebooting, or change the setting in general by clicking the \"General\" icon System Preferences and making sure there's a checkmark in \"Close windows when quitting an app\".\nA third possibility is that it is possible to create configuration files for launchd that will automatically start programs at boot or login. You'll find these configurations files in:\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n\nNote that the ~ characters means your user's home folder.\nA final possiblity is that applications in macOS can come with a \"shared helper application\". Essentially this application would provide some background service to one or more actual applications from that developer. Some use that helper application to later launch their actual application.\nThe helper application is located within the application's bundle in the Contents/Library/LoginItems folder. For Spotify that is usually in the following location:\n/Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/StartUpHelper.app\n\nYou can prevent that from autostarting Spotify by closing the helper app, or making sure that it cannot start (for example by removing the executable bit on the actual executable: /Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/StartUpHelper.app/Contents/MacOS/StartUpHelper)\n", "Q: Reenable Spotlight I noticed that spotlight was using a lot of CPU and I did not have time to debug it, so I disabled spotlight with this command:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\nNow I want to reenable spotlight and debug why it is non-stop indexing my drive, but I can't figure out how to reenable it.\n$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist: service already loaded\n\nBut when I search for anything I get \"No Results\".\nHere is my configuration:\n\n\nHow do I get indexing reenable?\n[EDIT]\nI tried one of the suggested answers with this result:\n % sudo mdutil -a -i off\nPassword:\n/:\n2020-09-03 15:35:44.980 mdutil[33360:1381738] mdutil disabling Spotlight: / -> kMDConfigSearchLevelFSSearchOnly\n    Indexing disabled.\n/System/Volumes/Data:\n2020-09-03 15:35:45.026 mdutil[33360:1381738] mdutil disabling Spotlight: /System/Volumes/Data -> kMDConfigSearchLevelFSSearchOnly\n    Indexing disabled.\n/Volumes/MBP15 Time Machine:\n2020-09-03 15:35:45.060 mdutil[33360:1381738] mdutil disabling Spotlight: /Volumes/MBP15 Time Machine -> kMDConfigSearchLevelFSSearchOnly\n    Indexing enabled.

Using the free app called Karabiner Elements, you can remap the Caps Lock key to both Control, if held and another key is pressed, and also Esc, if pressed by itself.\nIf using Karabiner Elements, and you need Caps Lock functionality, you can either assign it to the Control key or, what I do, is assign it to toggle when I press both left and right shift at the same time.\nI hope someone else finds a true solution or that Apple updates Safari with at least an option to change this behavior.\n", "Q: Tech consideration for ios application I am thinking about publishing an application for a client,\nWe are considering two approaches\n\n*\n\n*An application which basically is a wrapper for a responsive website\n\n*A native application\n\nI came across this article:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#minimum-functionality\nstating that apple will reject my application.\nIf i try to upload my application will it be rejected?\n\nA: The app will not be rejected if it provides functionality outside the scope of the standard website.\nApple only rejects apps which are specifically just wrappers on a site.\nExample, I wrote an app that was basically a wrapper on a site, they rejected it, I added the ability in a second tab to draw and post the pic to the site (a novel feature), they approved it.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro takes longer time to open some apps while connected to wifi I am using a 2017 None Touch Bar MacBook Pro. It's running on MacOs Catalina 10.15.5 (19F101). I have noticed many times that when I try to open some apps like Chrome, IINA player etc, while connected to WiFi, it takes a lots of time. But as soon as I turn off WiFi, they start immediately. Also when I try to open those without connecting to wifi, they also start immediately. Anyone have experiencing this scenario.\nMy WiFi connectivity is 3Ghz IPV4 and It does not have any issue with my other connected devices like iPhone.\n\nA: Starting with macOS Catalina, macOS now automatically sends the signature of every executable you open to Apple. Obviously, if you don't have an internet connection, it won't check with Apple's servers. When you do have an internet connection, it must send the signature to Apple's servers, then wait for the response. This is made worse by slower internet.\n\nA: Some apps ping their own servers, so it takes some time. Sometimes gatekeeper decides to check something by connecting to Apple servers. Using firewall helped speedup the launch time of some apps.

It's not designed this way.\nFirst off, the Mac keyboards aren't designed to have multiple pairings.  If you want to swap between two machines, you need a keyboard and mouse with that capability.  The same thing goes for the mouse.\nSecondly, allowing the ability to do a Bluetooth pairing outside of an authenticated session is a major security flaw.  This would allow an attacker to install any sort of device, including nefarious ones, without your consent.

MacOS failing to set up 169.254 routing. Why? How do I fix? Violates RFC 3927? Hint: multi-homed? (Too-wordy title: Macs connected with an Ethernet cable can't see each other - MacOS failing to set up 169.254 routing, AKA link-local address configuration. Why? How do I fix?  Is it violating RFC 3927? Hint: One Mac has a normal, working Ethernet (over Wi-Fi) connection, which may make it a multi-homed host.)\nI'm trying to communicate between two Macs over an Ethernet cable.  This should \"just work\", I thought, but it does not appear that MacOS is automatically setting things up as it is supposed to.\nOnly after detecting there's a physical connection do the autoconf IP addresses get assigned (as shown by ifconfig en0 before vs after connection) so it's clear they CAN see each other at the physical level.\nOne of the Macs is (was) at the OS setup stage where it is looking for other computers on the network from which to migrate information.  Sharing is enabled.\nBut they can't see each other at the OS level.  E.g.\n\n\n*Nothing to connect to shows up on the Mac in OS setup.\n\n*Nothing shows after choosing Go...Network in the Finder.\n\n*<I forget what else I tried.>\n\n*No response to pings of the broadcast address. (ping 169.254.255.255)\n\n*There are no entries in the MAC address table (as shown by arp -an) for the other Mac even right after #5.\n\n*The appropriate routing table entries (as shown by netstat -rn don't exist)\n\nIt's failing to set up 169.254 routing, AKA link-local addressing so the Macs can communicate properly. In other words, it's failing to fully set up the en0 (TP Ethernet) interfaces so that link-local addressing works automatically.\nWondering what was going on, I looked to the documentation. I thought since it apparently followed RFC 3927 on Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses, would \"just work\", but not so.\nIn particular, it is automatically assigning IPs to the devices, but it is NOT routing packets / setting up the routing table accordingly.\nFrom the RFC:\n\nAbstract\n\n... This document describes how a host may\nautomatically configure an interface with an IPv4 address within the\n169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with other devices\nconnected to the same physical (or logical) link.\n\n\nIs MacOS violating RFC 3927?  Why shouldn't two Macs connected over an Ethernet cable, each with automatically assigned 169.254/16 link-local addresses see each other?\nThis might be a fix; I haven't figured it out yet: sudo route -n add -net 192.168/16 169.254/16 169.254.14.233. (That's the automatically self-assigned IP.). (Update: Won't know; too late and it had a typo.)\n\nA: So I'm looking at the same connection a month later, but with both Macs in normally booted mode.\nSo now, the 169.254 routing is set up just by plugging the cable.\nThe other machine is visible in the IP and ARP routing tables.\nThe problem has gone away.\n(I can reach the other machine with mDNS now as per @John Keates; ping [the other machine-name, now that I know it].local works.  But I can't go back in time to see if it would have worked.)\nAlso, I realized I screwed up that route command (just corrected), so that could be causing some remaining weird things I don't understand.  (I need to reboot this system!?):\nOh, and I just found out my Ca blood levels have been off, so some confusion it likely caused may have been a major cause of the (alleged) MacOS problem!  Cringe.

Forwarding Rules\n\n... if the destination address is in the\n169.254/16 prefix (excluding the address 169.254.255.255, which is\nthe broadcast address for the Link-Local prefix), then the sender\nMUST ARP for the destination address and then send its packet\ndirectly to the destination on the same physical link.  This MUST be\ndone whether the interface is configured with a Link-Local or a\nroutable IPv4 address.\nIn many network stacks, achieving this functionality may be as simple\nas adding a routing table entry indicating that 169.254/16 is\ndirectly reachable on the local link.  This approach will not work\nfor routers or multi-homed hosts.  Refer to section 3 for more\ndiscussion of multi-homed hosts.\n\n\nSection 3 then goes into great detail as to why.\n(On the other hand, Appendix A says:\n\n\n... Mac OS systems do not send packets addressed to a Link-Local address\nto the default gateway if one is present; these addresses are always\nresolved on the local segment. ...\n\n\nI find that this is not currently true.)\nAnd after reading in Section 3.3, \"Since HOST2's address is not in\n169.254/16\" I'm confused again, as in the provided scenario, I think it will/should be the case that HOST2's address is in 169.254/16... perhaps that's an error in the RFC.  Probably I'm just confused...\n\nA: Quoting from this Wikipedia article:\n\nBlockquote\nAn Ethernet crossover cable is a crossover cable for Ethernet used to connect computing devices together directly.

It wouldn't be out of the ordinary for Apple to break things again with a macOS update.  How many times has an update broken something like WiFi only to be fixed in the subsequent release?\nEven with a software patch, you can't get around physics.  IMO, there's an unreasonable expectation when it comes to MacBook Pro computers: users want them to be razor thin, completely silent, and über powerful.  Unfortunately, physics has a bad habit of crashing the party.\nIf you want all the power of a high end CPU and GPU then you have to deal with the heat it generates.  Dealing with heat means cooling - proper heat sinks and fans.  That alone has a balance you must strike - if you want proper cooling but have something be very quiet, you need larger heat sinks.  If you want something razor thin, thereby limiting the size of the heat sink, you need a fan which inherently makes noise.  So, if the market is demanding a razor thin, silent laptop with an i9 processor and GPU, then the trade off will be thermal throttling.\nSo, to answer your question, it's a design problem with that form factor and it's not limited to your MacBook Pro - other manufacturers are dealing with this issue.\nFrom a personal perspective, I wouldn't get a MacBook with an i7 or i9 processor because it just doesn't have the size heat sink required to efficiently dissapate heat.  The fans are also to anemic to efficiently cool things down.  This means it has to throttle to limit heat which means you're not getting the CPU you paid for.  To put it another way, I would rather have an i5 that can run at 100% with no throttling than an i7 or i9 that can only run at 50-75% because of throttling.\n\nA: In my opinion you are not seeing CPU throttling, but one of Intel's power saving features known as Dynamic Frequency Scaling or more specifically Intel SpeedStep. While idle, the CPU can dynamically reduce clock speed to reduce power consumption.\nCPU throttling only occurs if certain constraints are reached, such as high temperature or power consumption.\nJudging from your figure neither are the case. Also it is practically not possible to tell if CPU throttling is occurring from your screenshot.\nPlease see my question here on how to identify throttling on MacBooks:\nHow to monitor and control thermal CPU throttling in OS X?\nIn case you still think you are experiencing CPU throttling, I suggest you update your question with the output from pmset -g thermlog as described in the accepted answer or update your screenshot with one from the latest Intel Power Gadget where the REQ parameter gives you an indication of throttling.\n", "Q: Can't delete files from APFS volume -- no space left on device My Late 2012 iMac's APFS Fusion Drive is full (53 KB free) and caused the system to freeze.

I tried to follow this guide to copy the generated file in the Overrides folder and restarted my MacBook Pro, but it didn't work.  Any idea?\nMaybe full hd is too small a resolution for a 27 inch monitor?\n\nA: The quality of the image is dependent (among other things) on the density of the pixels -- how small they are.\nA 27\" display of 1920 x 1080 pixels will have a pixel density of around 82 pixels per inch.\nTo give some perspective, your MacBook Pro's display has a pixel density of 219 pixels per inch. The very first iPhone had a density twice that of your screen.\nWhen buying a monitor, it's not just how big it is, but how many pixels it has. The Apple Thunderbolt Display, for example, is 27\" but with 2560 x 1440 pixels, so 109dpi. There are plenty of  27\" displays with 3840 x 2160 pixels (\"4K\"), so c. 164 ppi.\nThe higher the pixel density, the sharper the image and text. You can't really expect great quality from a 1080p 27\" display.\nNote that some manufacturers specify 'pixel pitch' rather than PPI.

Open that, go to all fonts, select them all, make sure to click on 'Download' if the option appears on the right side and it could also say that there are duplicates.

When I tried to run Windows again, I couldn't so I decided to delete Windows 10 and Ubuntu and just keep MacOS. I deleted the partitions but couldn't get the deleted space to combine with the MacOS partition. When I checked the type, it said unknown type. So I rebooted my computer but when it turned on it started flashing the question mark file. I found a previous question that matched my problem so I followed it.\nData Not Backed Up, Partition Type: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF\nI got to the step where you do gpt remove then I realized I needed my original numbers to be able to do gpt add. Is there any way I can get my boot, data and settings back?\n\nThis is my first time posting, I usually read other questions and the answers a few times over but this time I really messed up. Any and all help is very much appreciated. Thank you in advance.\nTLDR: Forgot to note down the size and starting before gpt remove.\noutput from the commands export LC_CTYPE=\"ASCII\";dd if=/dev/disk1 count=1 skip=409640 | vis -c\n\nAfter running the gpt command that @David Anderson said below. I was able to boot using an external drive and see my MacOS partition. I restarted and was able to boot into my original drive. The only problem is that there seems to be 187.85GB of memory available rather than the full 240GB.\nEdit: I was able to remove the \"free space\" partition from Disk Utility and now have access to all 240GB.\nThank you so much @David Anderson, you saved 4 years worth of my data and settings.\n\nA: \nNote: This answer assumes the missing partition on disk1 was not part of a fusion container.\n\nThe answer you posted shows the string NXSB\\0\\^P\\0\\0+\\M-L\\M-;\\^B\\0\\0\\0\\0. This can be converted to hexadecimal and ASCII values by entering the commands given below.\nexport LC_CTYPE=\"ASCII\"\necho -nE \"NXSB\\0\\^P\\0\\0+\\M-L\\M-;\\^B\\0\\0\\0\\0\" | unvis | hexdump -Cv\n\nThe output from this command is given below.\n00000000  4e 58 53 42 00 10 00 00  2b cc bb 02 00 00 00 00  |NXSB....+.......|\n00000010\n\nThe string 2b cc bb 02 00 00 00 00 when byte reversed is the hexadecimal value of 2bbcc2b, which is 45,861,931 in decimal. This means the APFS file system contains 45,861,931 blocks, where a block is 4096 bytes in size. In your case, this can be converted to 512 byte sectors by multiplying by 8. The result is 366,895,448 sectors. In this case, the commands to add the APFS container partition are given below.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk1\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 366895448 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk1\n\n\nNote: If missing partition is part of a fusion container, then the value of 366895448 needs to be reduced by the byte size of the other partition after dividing by 512.\n\n", "Q: What gets copied (and what doesn't) during a Target Mode copy? I recently cloned my old, dying computer into a new one, using Target Mode and a Firewire 800 cable via Recovery Mode.\nEverything looked perfectly identical. I launched Safari on the new computer, and all the tabs I was browsing were there.\nBut when I opened Chrome, there were no tabs open, and the extensions were uninstalled.\nI'm trying to understand what happened, and where these files were copied for Target Mode to omit them.\nWhich files does Target Mode copy - and which files does it not copy - when cloning a hard drive with Recovery Mode?\n\nA: Target Disk Mode just turns the whole Mac into an external drive. There's essentially no difference between doing that and taking the drive out and putting it in a FireWire drive enclosure.\nThere's nothing special about TDM that makes it not-copy certain files.\nHowever, when using a cloning app, some files may or may not be included. These are usually just 'temporary' data, such as caches, or machine-specific files that the system will recreate if absent. There may be options in the cloning app to exclude other files.\n", "Q: iCloud: Restore file which has been deleted a few days prior. How long possible?

Everything was fine until I uninstalled Google Backup and Sync in favor of Dropbox Plus (what a mistake!). I ended up actually restoring my entire internal flash drive from a backup, which I thought would restore GB&S to normal functioning, but ever since then, when I launch GB&S and configure it to back up my Desktop and Documents folders on \"My Laptop\" to the \"Computer\" tab in Google Drive, it asks me if I want to merge files from my local Desktop and Documents folders with those in my laptop as it appears in the \"Computers\" section of Google Drive. I thought it meant unidirectionally (i.e. backup), but what happens is that GB&S starts downloading stuff that was deleted long ago! If I cancel the merge requests, GB&S basically stops.\nIs there any way to insure unidirectional backup?\n\nA: I wound up deleting my computer and all documents from the \"Computer\" tab in Google Drive, and backing up everything again.

The battery is very nearly shot. The numbers reported by coconutBattery also reported by System Profiler.\nHow can I reset those crazy Maximum Battery Charge and Current Battery Capacity to actual numbers?\nI've removed the battery and done a SMC reset with no change.\n\n\nA: I would look for a different app. It may be hard to find one for your system. Several I looked at were for newer system versions than you have. You can try the Edurance app which supposedly has options to increase battery life or use an increased speed of your mac. The downside is that this app is $20.00.  That's a lot to pay when many apps for battery life are free. They supposedly have a free trial. There was no minimum system given for this app so it may run on 10.4.\nThere is also a way to determine the number of cycles your battery has used. The instructions are given here. In this link, there are other links to determine the maximum cycles your battery has before it needs a battery replacement. Once you determine how many cycles your battery has you can go to one of the links and see if it includes your model.\n", "Q: $PATH vs. $path I can't remember why, but a long time ago, I found that for some reason, I needed to set both of these variables.  It caused no problems in bash, but now in zsh, when I put\nexport PATH=~/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH\nexport path=$PATH\n\n(the same thing I used in .bashrc) in my initialization, I get\n/Users/…/.zshenv:export:7: path: inconsistent type for assignment\n\nWhat do they mean by \"type,\" and what is $path used for?\n\nA: The error mentioning ‘type’ refers to the data type of the variable, such as string or array.\n$PATH is a string, $path is an array. You cannot assign a string, whether by variable or by literal, to a variable typed to contain an array, since the types do not match.\nAs for what the difference between the two variables are: they are meant to represent the same list of folders, but in different formats. $PATH containing /path/to/one:/path/to/two would mean that $path’s first element is /path/to/one and the second one is /path/to/two.\nYou shouldn’t need to manage the two variables (and assigning one to the other won’t work since the types do not match) — the shell should handle it for you. Simply append to the $PATH string and the path you add should exist as an element of $path.\nThis only applies in zsh, inherited from *csh. You can see the ‘binding’ between the two variables with typeset -p PATH.\n$path being an array is really convenient:\n\n*\n\n*appending and altering the path can be done with array operations like append rather than string manipulation (requiring splitting and joining in the case of editing somewhere in the middle).\n\n\n*looping through is just for i ($path) { … } without needing to deal with the setting of the right split character.\n\nA: PATH is a scalar value- a continuous string of search paths separated by colons and path is an array of search paths. zsh will sync both path and PATH. There is no need for you to do so.\n\nA: Here's a nice tip\nprint -l $path\nbecause the type of this variable is an array, more operations are available\n", "Q: How can I use a TV as a second monitor wirelessly (without a cable)? I would like to use a TV or other screen as a second monitor, not as a mirror, but a fully separate monitor the way it would work with an HDMI cable.\nI usually use an HDMI cable for this but I'd like to be unattached and move freely. I travel frequently and this would be very useful for me to not have to carry around a long cable with me everywhere. Something like the Chromecast would work, but it requires extra software as far as I know to be used as a full separate extended desktop.\nI don't know if this is possible, and am happy to buy some kind of dongle if it exists.\nThe closest I know how to get to this currently is using the Chromecast dongle, which allows you to either cast a tab, application or your desktop (mirroring). Unfortunately it doesn't function as a fully separate desktop/monitor, so this isn't quite what I'm looking for.\n\nA: I assume that you are using a MacBook. If so, you can do it with an an Apple TV box, but since it works over WiFi, you will need to connect the AppleTV to the WiFi network. Use an HDMI cable to connect it to the TV. Then use Airplay on the McBook to connect wirelessly to the AppleTV and select \"Use as separate display\".\nIt would be much cheaper and easier to just use an HDMI dongle on the MacBook (mini display port, USB or USB-C depending on the model MacBook) and an HDMI cable to the TV.\n", "Q: iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 13.6.1 not supported by Xcode 11.7 An app I developed works fines with my iPhone 8 running iOS 13.6.1.

When I un-fullscreen Window A with  Cmd+Shift+F, Window B becomes un-full-screened.\nIs there any way to have one Chrome windows fullscreen and the other one normal?\n\nA: I am not sure how Cmd+Shift+F works for you to make window full screen. I am using Cmd+^(Control)+F to make window full screen and revert to normal.\nIf you are not using any extension like magnet, The possible issue might be that when you switch your window might not have been cycled, for which you will need to use Cmd+`(backtick) followed by  Cmd+^(Control)+F.\n\nA: I have the same starting position as you (two single Google Chrome windows).

See here for Apple’s instructions on how to do so.\nThe current instructions (which may change, so following the link is preferable) are:\n\nTo restrict explicit content and content ratings:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings and tap Screen Time.\n\n\n*Tap Content & Privacy Restrictions, then tap Content  Restrictions.\n\n\n*Choose the settings you want for each feature or setting under Allowed Store Content.\n\n", "Q: Xcode: How to determine which DeviceSupport is useful? When handling with MacBook storage problem,\n\nI found that Xcode's bad storage management is very painful.\nSeeing from the detail of DeviceSupport's item, it is about system library and Swift binary etc.\nI know I should remove the older items. My question is how to know which item is currently using, in\n/Users/usr/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS\\ DeviceSupport?\nSo I could remove the useless DeviceSupport, and keep the useful.\n\nA: Yes, Xcode keeps device support files for old devices and it's safe to delete them.\nIf you want to know which ones are still in regular use, you can check the 'Date Modified' attribute:\n\nor you can connect your devices to your Mac and check the OS version / build number in the Devices window of Xcode:\n\nThe arm64e version is for iOS devices with the A12 chipset or above: see the Stack Overflow question Xcode arm64 Vs arm64e and the list of devices with those chipsets on Wikipedia:\n\n*\n\n*Apple A12\n\n*Apple A13\n\nA: *\n\n*Reduce size of the Xcode application\nYou may delete all of them and install the necessary by going to Xcode preferences > Components > Simulators.\nIf you want to avoid the download by keeping the useful one,\n\n*\n\n*Connect the iPhone to the Mac.\n\n*Open window menu > devices and simulators.\n\n*See the iPhone model in \"Devices tab\".

I created a small mpeg that consists of a completely black frame that is five minutes long, but any video will work.  I run it in the QuickTime Player on a loop.  It does sometimes stop if I join a video meeting or something, depends on the program -- but generally works great.\nI believe Youtube in a browser window might also work -- you could open it to one of the 10 hour focus/relaxation channels for example.\n", "Q: CommanderOne: Clear the servers history I am using CommanderOne to connect to smb shares.

I understand the usefulness and convenience of a site like backblaze, but if I wanted an offline backup and my drive is under 100gb, would it make sense to just make an encrypted full disk dmg image of my main drive every once in a while and put on something like google drive which is a couple bucks a month for 100 gigs storage?\nIn case local backups aren't working (unlikely) I could use another computer to grab the file onto a thumb drive, and restore the image from disk utility recovery and it should work?\nCould the usb with the dmg be ntfs or exfat coming from windows, or would it have to be hfs+ or apfs for disk util to see it?\n\nA: Firstly, I think this depends on your personal price sensitivity, and factors like desire, or expectation for single file restoration, and tracking deleted files, as well as your internet connection. This is a fundamentally subjective and opinion based question.\nYes, you could image and save the whole image every month, but that comes with several drawbacks:\n\n*\n\n*Backblaze is 'only' $4 more per month - this is dependent on your price sensitivity.\n\n*You have to remember to do it (although this could probably be automated, that's an investment of your time and energy). Something like CarbonCopyCloner will give you drive image back-ups.\n\n*You only get monthly point-in-time restoration. If your drive dies tomorrow (or you lose local back-ups), you're losing a month of data.\n\n*Backblaze gives you the ability to restore files from anywhere.\n\n*Backblaze gives you the ability to restore individual files quickly and easily\n\n*Uploading a whole drive every month could be taxing / time consuming on your internet connection.\n\nTo directly answer the questions in the title:\n\n*\n\n*Necessary - this is entirely dependent on your risk tolerance and highly subjective. My personal opinion - backup everything that's personal to you (ie. can't be replaced), regardless of size.\n\n*Easier, no, Backblaze you set and forget and it uploads files every time they change. It's about as easy a solution as you can possibly get.\n\nBackblaze is not your only option though:\n\n*\n\n*iCloud will give you all your Documents off-site, and integrates into iOS and macOS so that it's as easy as Backblaze\n\n*Something like Arq allows you to backup to many different cloud providers - eg. AWS S3, and include Google Drive as a target option.\n\n", "Q: How do I prevent my disk from being bloated? What is \"Other\" and how do I prevent it from being bloated? I'm having to back up and format my hard drive every year due this happening.  As you can see, I have very little of everything else.  I mainly use some IDE's and web browsers and that's pretty much it. I'm using Catalina at the moment.\n\n\nA: If you click the \"review files\" option to the right of that list it should let you see a break down of your files to help you make decisions and see what is taking up space on your volume.\n", "Q: If I used tar to archive Time Machine's Backups.backupdb folder, can the resulting file be uploaded to a cloud service and later used without issues? If I were to use tar -xvf to create an archived .tar file of the Backups.backupdb folder Time Machine creates, would it sufficiently preserve hard links, etc? For example, if I uploaded to, say Google Drive, and later downloaded it in the future and extracted it to a new drive, would the extracted folder still be readable my Time Machine? Or would the safer route be imaging the entire drive?\n\nA: Creating an archive with tar (using the -c option) does by default preserve hard links. I.e. the file will only be stored once in the archive, and when you unpack the archive you'll get hard links on the file system again. It's only when you use the --hard-dereference option to tar that hard links are ignored.\nRemember also to use the -p option when creating and restoring the archive. This will preserve the permissions of files, including the ownership, ACL and other information.\nFinally I would strongly recommend that you test the backup of the backup after you have made it to ensure that it can be read properly by Time Machine to enable you to restore the actual backup.\n", "Q: How to return screen brightness to default level I accidentally changed the brightness on the iPhone SE ios 13.3   How do I change the screen brightness back to the default level, and if this is impossible, can someone tell me what the default level is?  Thanks.\n\nA: If you go to Settings on your iPhone and scroll down you should see a tab for \"Display & Brightness\". Tap this tab and you'll immediately see a slider marked \"Brightness\". There is no default level as such (default is to auto-adjust to ambient light levels) but you can adjust the slider to any level you want.\n", "Q: How can I override the default \"Work\" travel time start location in Calendar.app on macOS? I have both my work and home locations on my contacts card in Contacts. However, I'm working from home now far more than I used to. My work hours have remained the same however, so most of my calendar events during the day need to start from home rather than work.\nCalendar.app defaults to using the \"Start of Day\" and \"End of Day\" to determine your location (or a previous event within the 3 hours preceding). This means that any events during the day always default to give my travel time from my work location, not my home location. I've noticed this even includes holidays - eg. tomorrow is Labor Day in the USA, I'll be home, but Calendar is setting Work as the start location, and not letting me override it.\nHow can I override that start location with one that I set?\nI know I can go into the event and edit it on my phone using the iOS calendar, but that seems a little clunky when I'm at my computer I want to use the computer.\nInfo on the defaults I mention above from comes this Apple guide: https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/add-location-and-travel-time-to-events-icl43600/mac\nI'm on 10.15.6 (Catalina)\n\nA: This has annoyed me for SO long. I just figured it out. The clue was in the link you provided: \"If Calendar doesn’t find a location, it uses your work address or home address (from your card in the Contacts app), depending on the time of day. (Set your work hours in Calendar General preferences using the “Day starts at” and “Day ends at” pop-up menus.)\"\nWhen I changed my work hours and restarted Calendar, the \"Home\" option appeared under \"Travel Time\". So it's looking for where you are in that 3 hour window and if you don't have a specific work event scheduled, it looks to see what time you started work, if that makes sense.\nHappy scheduling!\n\nA: I figured out how to make Calendar in macOS use your home location all the time for travel time even if you keep a work address in your contact card.\nIf you set your \"Day starts at\" and \"Day ends at\" to \"Noon\", it will always use your home address. Oddly, inversely, if you set both values to \"Midnight\", it will always use your work address.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Permissions errors after weird Time Machine restored backup I made a time machine backup of everything that was in /Mac/Users/MYUSER/ and nothing else.\nI then erased my drive and reinstalled MacOS.\nWhen I tried to restore from my Time Machine Backup, it made a directory /Mac/2020-09-05-185317/ and did not place the files in the correct places, but instead put the file hierarchy inside /Mac/2020-09-05-185317/ so all my files were in /Mac/2020-09-05-185317/Mac/Users/MYUSER/. There are not a lot of files, so I decided to start moving them from that directory to their proper places manually myself.\nNow when my ~/Music dir finished moving, I tried to open iTunes and I get \"The folder “iTunes” is on a locked disk or you do not have write permissions for this folder.\".\nI've checked the permissions in the finder and the iTunes permissions says \"MYUSER | Read & Write, staff | Read only, everyone | Read only\". I then tried to rename the /Mac/Users/MYUSER/Music/iTunes directory and when doing so, it asks for my root/user password, which I thought was weird/unusual. After renaming the dir, I then opened iTunes and it created a new /Mac/Users/MYUSER/Music/iTunes directory so I compared an ls -la of the newly generated iTunes directory and the renamed copied directory and they matched/were the same.\nI've read a few guides and see now that I did not copy over the /Mac/Users/Shared directory with my backup, and I cannot go back and grab it since I wiped my computer. Is this the problem?\nI've also tried following This guide, and this guide but nothing has helped.\nHow do I fix the permissions problem?\nNOTE: I am running Mac OS Sierra 10.12.6\n\nA: It ends up that you need to use the Mac Finder UI to set the permissions of the whole user home directory and not just the Music directory. I was able to fix the issue using the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Opening Finder, navigate to my user/home directory (/Mac/Users/MYUSER) and show the \"Get Info\" pane\n\n*Open the \"Sharing and Permissions\" drop down\n\n*Clicking the Lock Icon and entering the User password\n\n*Clicking the Gear Icon and selecting \"Apply to enclosed items...\"\n\nThis fixed all permissions issues I saw and iTunes was able to view and play music again.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13” mid-2012 iSight cable port broken I accidentally ripped the iSight display port away from the motherboard on my MacBook Pro during a display replacement. I’m fine with working without a camera since the quality is bad anyway.

Is this also true for this MacBook Pro model? What problems would I run into during use if I didn’t fix this problem?\n\nA: I know of no Mac that has a temperature sensor as part of the cable assembly nor a temperature sensor as part of the FaceTime camera.\nHowever, I can tell you from direct first hand experience, there won’t t be any temperature related issues from a damaged FaceTime cable or camera.

How to do that exactly depends on the specific browser you're using.\nThe linked video shows using Chrome in 2015. In older versions of Chrome, it would always fall back to a direct connection to the web site host if all proxy servers are unavailable. That behavior was changed, and it is not how modern Chrome versions work by default.\n", "Q: I am trying to find my iphone .

We have ordered some 16\" macbooks for our developers but they're not charging/ booting up. When I try to boot up, a battery icon appears on black screen just like empty battery situation despite being charged for hours! I'm attaching a photo. I've tried SMC reset and other stuff mentioned in Apple website but no luck. I've 6 macbooks like that! Very disappointing... I'm just wondering, if anyone else come across this issue before or solved?\n\nRegards!\n\nA: Just wanted to share my potential fix of this issue.\nI bought a refurbed 16\" i9 from Micro Center and out of the box, I couldn’t get it to boot up. I had the exact same screen that others in this thread did. Tried resetting the PRAM, and then tried Artem’s method. No luck.\nI then randomly noticed that holding down Control, Option, and Command without the charger plugged in gave me a slightly different screen. It was the red battery logo with the lighting bolt, but then it would also have the little AC plug icon next to it. I then tried plugging in the USB-C cord in after holding down these three keys, while the red battery/lighting bolt/AC plug icons were on the screen. I then heard the familiar “boop” sound (which I never heard before).\nWhen I went to try this again, I got the Apple logo and the boot up bar on my screen, and the machine proceeded to start up normally. Went to check the batter in info right away, and the machine only had 6 battery cycles on it.\nIn short, here’s what I did.\n\n*\n\n*Hold down Control, Option, and Command without the AC power plugged in for 5-7 seconds.\n\n\n*This resulted in the screen showing the red battery, lighting bolt, and AC plug icon (for about 5 seconds).\n\n\n*Plugged in the AC power while this screen in #2 was on. Heard the familiar “boop” sound.\n\n\n*Hit a key and the machine powered on.\nI still have a 15 day return window on the machine so I plan on running the battery down to zero to see if this issue comes up again. If it does, I’ll probably take it back.\n\nA: This happened to me twice in the past day: I purchased both of the following model MacBook Pro 16-inch laptops and both exhibited the exact same behavior.

I'll let you all know later today...\n\nA: There is a problem with the USB mux chip that will prevent the MacBook from charging.\nThe mux chip is what negotiates the power required (20V) to charge the Mac.  What's happening is 5V is being passed so there's enough to power the Mac to display the icon you're seeing, but not enough to power it or charge the battery.\nThe chip in question is the CD3215.  I've seen reports where liquid damaged caused the issue and other reports where they simply fail out of the box.  There's more on this issue on this video.\nThe fix is to replace the logic board (especially if brand new or still under AppleCare) or to have the chip replaced by a place that does board level repair (Rossman Repiar in the video is excellent - not affiliated, just a happy customer).\n\nA: I've got the same issue.\nI'm a remote developer and my company sent to me a new machine.\nJust unpackaged fresh MacBook Pro 16 (model a2141, MVVL2RU/A, 2.6GHz 6C / 16GB,AMD Radeon Pro 5300M 4GB / 512GB).\nIt wasn't charged which is strange for Apple product - usually you expect it to turn on right out of the box.\nAnd now it was trying to charge for almost 24h but it still won't launch.\nI can see keyboard lit and battery icon on screen for about 10 sec and then it's turning off.\nI've checked that wire and adaptor are working, because they were able to charge another MacBook Pro 16 but with a little different configuration (A1990)\nSoo look's like I need to get replacement...\n\nUPDATE:\n(Excuse me for my English...)\nOkay, so, after a day of searching for a solution MacBook finally turned on.\nWhat I did?\nActually I do not have any special solution for this, I can only explain what were the trials.\nI tried to reset SMC many times randomly using different schemes from internet, because they are differ for MacBook generations. Every scheme was tried more than once, so I'm not sure that it was a solution.\nBefore that I tried to charge MacBook using every usb-c port without any luck. But MacBook even didn’t become warm.\nSo what I noticed:\nIf you plug usb-c wire you can see battery icon with and little thunder icon for about 10 secs. If you unplug the wire screen will turn off immediately.\nSo I tried to check every port successively. I plug a wire, see icon and then unplug it so screen become black.\nI tried this for every port several times and on the next trial I saw that little thunder icon changed for a millisecond before screen turned off.\nIt was something new and after that I plugged wire in again and noticed that MacBook become warm. After 15 minutes I tried to unplug and plug wire again and MacBook turned on.\nI do not now if it was any coincidence or whatnot but this is what I did.\n\nA: I've a solution.

However, it looks like this is a ghost folder - there are only subfolders in there with no files whatsoever:\n\nWhat is this folder and is it safe to erase it completely if it's empty anyways?\n\nA: The cause of your crashes is Avast AV software. Make sure you've installed a version that is compatible with your OS, or uninstall it completely (this may require running an uninstaller - contact Avast for details).\nApplication Scripts are, as the name suggests, scripts that are specific to a given application. The OS creates a folder for each application installed, regardless of whether it has any scripts or not.\nFrom what I can read in your picture, the paths given are to /Library/Application Support, not Scripts, which is a different thing altogether.\nThat is the root level /Library folder, not the one in the user domain. That is where apps may install component files that are essential to their running.\nI'd recommend just uninstalling Avast instead.\n", "Q: Can't locate /.Spotlight-V100 anywhere, spotlight has incomplete results even after index rebuild I tried everything I could find on StackExchange and the internet, including the official apple-suggested approach of removing adding and removing the volume to privacy https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201716 .

My machine is a 2010 iMac though. I don't expect this to be the cause for you. But just to be sure you can run Drive DX an app to check the health of your drive. The app is not free but they have a free trial. If your disk is fine, I suggest EtreCheck. This app will tell you the status of your machine and generate a report about the info it finds. It told me my speed was well below the standard speed of my computer type. It also pointed out possible reasons for the speed drop. Etrecheck also has a free trial.\nAs a final step to quantify your speed drops by running Geekbench, which is an app that calculates the speed of your chips by running a few minutes' worths of tests. If gives you a single core and multicore scores and compares them with benchmarks for your machine type and you can compare your scores with scores from many others. This will give you some proof of your slowdown as well.\n", "Q: Selling original RAM to OWC after installing an upgrade I purchased a 27\" iMac with 16GB RAM in April direct from Apple. I just upgraded the RAM to 64GB from OWC. They have an offer where they will buy back your original RAM within 60 days of your purchase, in my case offering $40 for the two RAM sticks that came with my iMac.\nThese unused sticks will likely just sit in a drawer... however, they might be good to keep in case the new RAM were to fail. I have an internal debate going on whether or not to keep the memory in case something happens. What I would like to know is will Apple give me a hard time if I need to take my Mac in for some unrelated issue and I should therefore keep it and swap it back in should that need arise?\n\nA: \nWill Apple give me a hard time if I need to take my Mac in for some unrelated issue and I should therefore keep it and swap it back in should that need arise?\n\nIf you bought the product in the US, they legally cannot give you a hard time about it due to the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act.  Specifically, using 3rd party parts cannot void your warranty. Outside the US, check your local/federal laws specific to your country.\nWhere the Act applies to your question is with respect to using 3rd party parts.  Specifically, they cannot \"tie in\" genuine Apple Parts (i.e. hard drives or memory) to keep the warranty in tact:\n\n(c) Prohibition on conditions for written or implied warranty; waiver by Commission; No warrantor of a consumer product may condition his written or implied warranty of such product on the consumer’s using, in connection with such product, any article or service (other than article or service provided without charge under the terms of the warranty) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name;\n\nThe FTC has opined on this very question and I've written about it as part of an existing answer: Apple cannot void your warranty solely for using a 3rd party accessory.  Note, \"accessory\" isn't limited to peripheral device like mouse or keyboard, but any compatible part like memory, hard drives, etc.\nCan they try to give you grief about it?  Sure.  But that's where going in armed with the knowledge of what your rights are will help immensely.  Further, speaking from a pragmatic side of things, all they (or you) have to do is simply remove the memory.  Just because you bought it with 16GB of RAM doesn't mean you must take it in as you bought it - you can bring it in with 8GB (remove the 3rd party memory).\nAnd again, speaking from a pragmatic point of view, the odds of more than one memory module failing at the time same time is very low.  If a module fails you can remove the failed component and continue to function, so there's no need to keep backups of memory unless you're in a mission critical environment where uptime is key.\nStandard disclaimer:  I'm not a lawyer and definitely not your lawyer.  Nothing written here should be construed as legal advice; it is simply my interpretation/opinion on this matter.  If you need legal advice, seek out the services of an attorney in your area.\n\nA: I'd suggest that the chances of the Mac needed repair are slim; the chances that Apple takes issue with the third-party RAM slimmer (it is a user-serviceable part); and the chances that Apple might inadvertently replace your RAM with the factory-installed amount as part of that repair are even slimmer.\nI've kept all the original RAM from a succession of Macs, and I've never had recourse to re-fit it before the hardware got EOLed. I've usually sold them on eBay or taken them to the local recycling centre.\n", "Q: disable SIP on a remote/headless machine running Sierra? I have a remote 2012 mac mini running Sierra.  Long ago I was doing some troubleshooting and had created a secondary copy of the system on the machine.  Once I had finished whatever I was doing (which I don't even remember anymore) I got my working system running again and deleted the alternate one.  Trouble is since it contains system files, they are locked down by SIP and can't be deleted without disabling SIP.  Which of course can only be done from recovery mode, which requires having a display and keyboard attached to the machine in question.

Or,\n\n*Empty the trash of protected items without having to disable SIP first?\n\nThe machine is running Sierra and SIP is definitely enabled currently (csrutil status).\n\nA: \nDisable SIP without using recovery mode at all? I have found other threads (such as here and here) about this and the consensus appears to be \"no\", but I thought I would reiterate the question here to be thorough.\n\nSystem Integrity Protection cannot be disabled from a normal mode boot (from ones's Desktop). The Apple provided method is to use csrutil disable from Terminal while booted to macOS Recovery. What good would it be if it could be disabled from a normal mode boot? (Rhetorical question!)\nAs mentioned by David Anderson in a comment, one could use rEFInd to disable SIP, however, this cannot be done from a normal mode boot (from ones's Desktop) and would require having rEFInd installed and rebooting the system to rEFInd, which you'd have no control of from a headless-system without a keyboard.\n\nEmpty the trash of protected items without having to disable SIP first?\n\nFrom a normal mode boot (from one's Desktop), no, however one can delete the various .Trashes and .Trash directories from Terminal in macOS Recovery without disabling SIP and then reboot back to normal mode boot and those directories will be recreated.\nWhat good would SIP be if one could bypass its restrictions from a normal mode boot?

I tried to learn how to do this from Z shell alone, but I was very overwhelmed with it and I decided to use python which I already know.\nHere's what I'm doing:\nMy Python3 code:\nimport os\n\nurl = os.popen(\"echo `pbpaste`\").read()\nos.system(\"youtube-dl -f 'bestaudio[ext=m4a]' '\"+url+\"'\")\n\nMy zsh file:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\ncd /Users/admin/Downloads\npython3 /Users/admin/Documents/Scripts/Automation/ytGetAudio/ytGetAudio.py\n\nI then made it executable with \"chmod +x /Users/admin/Documents/Scripts/Automation/ytGetAudio/ytGetAudio.zsh\"\nWhen I run my program from the terminal, everything works great, and the file is downloaded into Downloads, but when I use Automator to \"Run Shell Script\" and I get it to run the same zsh script it doesn't download anything. I tested it by creating a pop-up message box in the python script; that worked, so the script is running, but something isn't working because nothing is downloading when I run the '.app' file.\nCan anyone please help me with this?\n\nA: Thanks to the answers I got about paths, I was able to solve this. It lead me to this: My Automator Workflow fails because it fails to find the git command within the 'Run Shell Script' command? Need help\nwhich solved everything.\nAdded the following to the start of the script:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\n\nA: This is the standard issue with GUI apps in macOS. These are launched via lanuchd from desktop, no part of the process has run through a shell so what is in any of your shell start up scripts e.g. $PATH does not matter.\nWhat you need to do is use the full path to anything you call in your case the full path to youtube-dl and if that is a script that might need editing to provide full paths to what it calls.\n", "Q: How do I import an old pre-.itl iTunes LIbrary into Catalina Music.app? I want to open an iTunes library I created a long time ago (2012, 10.8 Mountain Lion) in Catalina’s new Music.app. Option-clicking Music.app gives me the option to open a pre-existing library, but when I navigate to its location in the file requester, there’s no .itl file to select. There’s an .xml file, but it’s greyed out.\nI assume the library was created before .itl files existed and not opened up with a newer version of iTunes since, and hence not been updated. How do I open this library in Music.app?\n\nA: I believe the xml was for 3rd party support. The library file you want may not have an extension if you can't find an iTunes Library.itl file.\nHowever, if your your goal is to just move the music and some of the meta-data about the tracks, then try drag and drop:\n\n*\n\n*Open Music in one half of the screen (for reasons that will be obvious later, it makes it a tiny bit easier to put the Music app on the right side of the screen).\n\n*Open a Finder window in the other half using list, icon, or gallery view (this works in column view but isn't as easy to describe the process).\n\n*Find the folder in the old library that has folders named for the artists (these contain the album folders which contain the individual tracks).\n\n*Select on artist folder, it doesn't matter which one.\n\n*Press ⌘A to select all. All artist folders should be selected. (If you don't want to move all the artists, then move just the artist folders you need; it starts getting more complicated if you want just select albums or tracks, but it can be done, as well.)\n\n*Drag any folder, all selected folders should go with it, to the Library section of the Music sidebar (it should get an outline around the Library options when your pointer is over the right spot).\n\n*Drop the files and Music will make a copy in the current Music directory.\n\n*You might have some duplicates now, so File > Library > Show Duplicate Items (not all items here are actually dupes, make sure the meta-data is exactly the same; sometimes Music/iTunes can't tell the difference between two different versions of the same track).\n\nIf the old iTunes library is still on the local drive with the Music library, it now has dupes of all the tracks you copied so you might consider removing the old library. But, wait until after you have a Time Machine backup of both sets and you're sure that everything you copied is in Music.\nSSL. I wanted extra details for other users who may not have as much experience with using Finder and/or drag and drop.\n\nA: I ended up option-opening Music and creating a new library in a directory on the same drive as the existing iTunes library. Then I unchecked “Organise music” in prefs and “Add[ed] to library...” all the files in the old library. Took a while, but worked.\n", "Q: How to get my passwords out of keychain access (and Firefox) from my CCC backup without a Mac? My MacBook Pro (running 10.11.6) has a swollen battery, so I shut it down promptly and am sending it in for service.  I have an up-to-date backup (a bootable backup) made with CarbonCopyCloner.  The servicing of the Mac will take a while (maybe a week or so).\nIn the meantime, a lot of my passwords are unknown to me.  They're mostly auto-generated fully random passwords, saved in either Keychain Access or in Firefox's password-saving feature (or sometimes both).  Obviously I know my login password and the passwords to unlock my keychains (though I often just use the default login keychain), but I don't know most of the other passwords.\nSince I do have email access through other devices, I could reset various passwords.  But that would be a lot of hassle, and then when I get my Mac back I would have to update the keychains and Firefox.\nI have other computers available running Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows (both 7 and 10) to which I can connect my CarbonCopyCloner backup.  I also have an older MacBook Pro from 2010 that I almost never turn on; I think it's running Mac OS Lion (10.7) but it might be Maverick (10.9?).  I'd rather not use that one if I don't have to.\nHow can I get my passwords out of the keychain(s) and Firefox data from within my backup?\n(For completeness, I actually do still have my laptop with the swollen battery since they're sending me a box in a couple days to use for shipping it.  But I'd really rather not turn it on given the swollen battery and potential for damage, plus I'm curious about this question for its own sake.)\n\nA: Keychain Access via Keysafe\nFor Keychain Access, I wrote Keysafe to be able to read and export from Keychain files – without requiring an Apple device:\n\nKeysafe reads and decrypts Apple Keychain files. Use Keysafe to securely access your passwords and credentials without a Mac.\n...\nKeysafe can read encrypted passwords and credentials from a Keychain file. To view encrypted information, the Keychain’s password is required. Keysafe does not cirmuvent the security of the Keychain file.\n\n", "Q: I cannot rearrange pages of a PDF in Preview Trying to learn how to use my camera, I downloaded this PDF manual. Once I opened it in Preview, I noticed that the pages were not in the right order, so I tried moving them in the left-side drawer to reorder them. But Preview wouldn't let me.\nI usually have no issue reordering pages of a PDF by dragging them around. But for some reason, I cannot rearrange this document (I can't rotate the pages either).\nI checked, and the file isn't locked and I have read and write permissions.\nWhy can't I reorder the pages of this PDF file?\n\nA: The PDF is, somehow, locked against editing.\nHere is the workaround I found, to achieve the desired result without having to use a third-party app. The idea is to duplicate the PDF from Preview in a way that will remove the restrictions.\nOpen the PDF and chose File then Print. In the dialog, chose size and orientation, then click on PDF on the bottom left, then Print to PDF.\nOpen the new file. It can now be modified at will, like any unlocked PDF.\n\nA: Apparently, reordering pages requires copying, which is not allowed for that PDF.\nPreview: Tools / Show Inspector / Lock tab gives this:\n\nThis image is from Preview in El Capitan. In High Sierra it says \"You may copy from this PDF\"!\n\nA: The pdf file appears to be encrypted.  You can use a tool like qpdf https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf to decrypt the pdf and gain full permissions on the file.\nI found a similar question/answer here https://superuser.com/a/924794 and running the following command qpdf --decrypt input.pdf output.pdf seemed to do the trick.\n\nA: You cannot edit a PDF in preview, you can only annotate and  yes, there is  a distinction between editing. and annotation.\nTo edit a PDF you will need  a tool like Adobe Acrobat (not the reader) or  any of the many 3rd party utilities designed to  do  so; the good ones  are  generally paid\nAdditionally, you can  edit PDFs in  Word as  well as  LibreOffice, it's not  as  seamless as  Acrobat but if  you own/subscribe to Office you don't have to purchase something else. LibreOffice is  free, of  course ( I prefer Word). Pages may  have this  ability, but I'm  not  a user of  it  so  I cannot confirm.\n", "Q: Mac chrome can't drag and scroll in bookmark folder I tried asking reddit and chrome forum but I think it's a Mac thing, something with scrolling, anyway I can't drag bookmarks up or down a folder on the bookmark bar, it gets stuck, from googling I found at least one person with a similar problem and lots of others with bookmark dragging problems.\nSometimes I want to rearrange on the fly, or add a seperator, bookmark manager is better, but less convenient for things like adding horizontal seperators, here's what it looks like\n\nDon't really have any ideas, I won't reinstall my whole chrome profile for it, too many bookmarks and things in my profile, I don't want to risk corruption, but any other ideas I'll try before I give up on it.\n\nA: This works by emulating the middle mouse, I did so using a preset in bettertouchtool for this function made by the dev\nhttps://community.folivora.ai/t/emulate-a-real-middle-click-including-dragging-with-the-trackpad-e-g-for-cad-programs/1076\nyou kind of have to use both hands on the trackpad but it works once you figure it out, probably do-able with other programs too.\n", "Q: How to restore less recent Whatsapp backup from iCloud drive? My Whatsapp iCloud backup didn't restore any chat history. I did backup about 100mb file to ICloud drive. However, when I tried to restore the backup, It was just one chat message and not the full chat history. I logged in to iCloud drive to find any backup files. But I don't see any backup files there either. Is there anyway to access my missing backup file or restore it?. I use iPhone 6s.\n\nA: Do you backup WhatsApp messages in WhatsApp settings or iPhone Settings? If so, you cannot access or view the backup files in iCloud Drive because it is not saved in iCloud Drive. It is unreachable like your iPhone backup.\nAs for the situation that you just got one chat history back, I think it is a bug. You can reinstall WhatsApp and try again.\n", "Q: How to disable Boot Camp and prevent any other OS installations? Is it possible to completely block the use of Boot Camp such that the current Mac OS installation is the only OS available to use? This is for T2 security chip enabled Macs specifically.\nI found this page: About Secure Boot\nI think the option to \"Disallow booting from external media\" takes care of scenarios where one could boot from a Linux live USB drive. But the \"Full Security\" option seems to indicate that Windows installed via the Boot Camp Assistant would still be considered secure or signed...? I want to know, if there is an option to block that avenue of installation as well; so effectively disabling Boot Camp.\nIf one were to set a firmware password, would a user be prompted for it every time when trying to boot into Windows? Like how this question may indicate: Booting into Windows partition prompts for firmware password. I am wondering if setting the firmware password is enough? For my specific scenario, the key is to prevent booting into another OS. I am OK if someone tried to install Windows via Boot Camp Assistant, but then became thwarted by the firmware password when trying to boot into Windows for the first time.\n\nA: If you do not want an user installing operating systems, then you would create a standard account for the user. In this case, the Boot Camp Assistant application can not be used to install Windows without first entering an administrator username and password. This is shown below for Big Sur.\n\nThe rest of this answer assumes the following. See About Secure Boot for more information.\n\n*\n\n*Firmware password protection is on.\n\n*Secure Boot is set to Full Security.\n\n*External Boot is set to Disallow booting from external media.\n\nThe firmware password is not required in the following cases:\n\n*\n\n*Selecting Restart in macOS… from the menu produced by clicking of the Boot Camp icon  in the notification area on the right side of the Windows taskbar.\n\n*Selecting macOS from the Boot Camp Control Panel in Widows.\n\n*Selecting your Boot Camp volume in Startup Disk preferences of the macOS System Preferences application. However, this does require the password of an administrator.\nThe firmware password is required in the following cases:\n\n*\n\n*Before using the Mac Startup Manager to choose the Windows (Boot Camp) volume.\n\n\n*Before using Mac Startup Manager to choose any macOS volume.\n\nIn other words, the firmware password is require only if the selection of a operating system is done using the firmware. The Mac Startup Manager is implemented in the firmware.\n\nIf one were to set the firmware password, the user would not necessarily be prompted for the password every time when trying to boot into Windows. The password is only asked for, when the Mac Startup Manager is involved.\nIf someone installed Windows via the Boot Camp Assistant, they would not be asked for the firmware password when trying to boot into Windows for the first time. They would not be asked after the first time either. Windows actually restarts (reboots) several times during installation.\n", "Q: Encrypted Time Machine backup is super slow using an encrypted USB volume? I have an external USB3 disk connected to my MacBook Pro. I first formatted it with GUID/APFS and encryption, and used the \"atto disk benchmark\" app to measure performance. It showed about 100MB for read/write.\nThen I turned to Time Machine, and selected that volume as encrypted backup drive.\nBut Time Machine writing the backup is super slow. It takes about 100 seconds for 1 megabyte to be written. Thing is running for 20, 30 minutes by now, and I see 17 MB out of 112 GB of progress. It is so slow that Time Machine won't even give me a \"time remaining\" information.\nIs there anything I am missing? Or should I just forget about using such kind of drive for an encrypted backup? (Doing an encrypted backup is a hard requirement.)\n\nA: Based on the comments by user Tetsujin and this apple community entry the \"answers\" are:\n\n*\n\n*Yes, a full disk encrypted TM backup to a USB3 drive is slow. Overall performance varies greatly, many small files need much more time compared to fewer large files. Overall, my 126 GB backup took about 12 hours.\n\n*The one thing that you can (and should) take care: format the whole disk as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\". If you don't select Encrypted, TM will later encrypt the drive on its own, which requires (again!) plenty of time (besides the time it took to just write the backup itself). My initial approach of using APFS: don't do that!\n\nNote: the one other thing I learned: you can easily suspend that first TM backup, simply by clicking the \"skip this backup\" menu item while it is running.\n", "Q: MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) [MacOs Catalina 10.15.6] Yellow tint when watching video in Netflix, Youtube or even Videos(Quick Time) I noticed recently that when i try watching youtube videos in full screen, when i didn't move my mouse and the play bar disappeared , my screen turn yellowish.

I'm trying to share the WiFi connection from my iPhone to my laptop = personal hotspot. The iPhone connects to a VPN and a quick check on phone browser (whatismyip) shows that this works ok. However, when my laptop connects to the iPhone hotspot through WiFi, the connection does not seem to use the VPN. Instead, the IP range belongs to my internet provider, just as if the VPN was turned off.\nIs this the normal behavior?\n\nA: This is not possible on iOS as it ships from the factory.\nWhen you create the hotspot, you turn your iPhone into a router with NAT clients on one side (usually WiFi) and your public IP on the other (Cellular).  As such, whatever config you had before (WiFi Internet with VPN) gets disabled.\nIf you want to use VPN while on your hotspot, the best approach is to use the VPN client on the end devices themselves (i.e. the Windows or macOS laptops connecting to your phone).\nHowever, if you're willing to Jailbreak, an app called TetherMe that supposedly allows it.  I haven't tested so YMMV.  Personally, I would go with a VPN on the end devices instead.\n", "Q: How to stop Safari on macOS from using https when I want http, when it's not in the HSTS listing When I try to visit certain sites and force http (for good reasons that do not need to be discussed here), Safari (macOS) forces the URL to use https - and since the site currently has no https support, I can't visit the site.\nThere are many answers that suggest that this is related to HSTS but this does not apply in my case:\nThe site in question is not listed in Safari's Privacy under WebSite Data nor does it appear in the HSTS.plist file. So, there is some other cause that forces Safari to use https, and I suspect it's from the fact that Safari has previously seen me visiting the site with https and now assumes I always want to do that.\nNote that when I load the URL with wget, then I get the http version just fine. That should prove that it's Safari's behavior, not the web site's.\nSo, beside the HSTS settings what other settings might there be that force https in Safari on macOS?\n\nA: I believe I have figured it out:\nThe site is an .app domain, e.g. domain.app. And those sites are by definition https-only. See here.\nSo, it's still HSTS related, but not on an individual site but for the entire \".app\" TLD. And for that reason I could not find the specific domain name listed in HSTS, nor would deleting the HSTS.plist help.\nWell, not sure if I should keep this question up. Maybe it helps others that run into this.\nBackground: It was my own site. I moved it, along with others, to a new server, and need to verify that they work with plain http. So I tested every site in http, and all but this one worked. So I assumed something wrong with the browsers.\nAnd not only Safari but also Firefox and Chrome want to do https only.\nStrangely, though, using other way to request the http site, such as the low level command wget, do not enforce the https requirement (they don't know about it, obviously), hence it misguided me into thinking the problem was a latent browser setting that I could fix.\n", "Q: How to customize Touch Bar on the Macbook Pro 13\" when Mathematica is on Whenever I use Wolfram Mathematica, the Touch Bar on my Macbook Pro has a \"New Document\" button.

So all of a sudden my MacBook went really slow, I contacted apple support tried everything they said, resetting nvram e.t.c, wiped out my entire disk and reinstalled the macOS, but the problem still not solved.\nAfter analysing the activity monitor I found that kernel task was taking 20-90% of the cpu most of the time on the higher side(70-90%) so I researched on internet found that it is the broken port or broken sound card that is causing this issue, and there were some people (or a person) saying that disabling the port will fix this.\nNote: I am pretty much certain that my upper left port is not functioning well, sometimes it works and sometimes I have rotate the charging pin and insert it again to make it work, so it's not sound card or any other component that's causing the issue but the port.\nSo long story short, I want to disable my port.\nmacOS Catalina 10.15.6, MacBook Pro 13 inch with two thunderbolt 3 ports, 2017\n\nA: \nSo long story short, I want to disable my port.\n\nTechnically, you can't.\nThe Thunderbolt ports really cannot be disabled because they are used for functions outside the operating system like charging.  So, even if you completely uninstall macOS the ports will continue to function, accepting and negotiating a charge.\nThe most you can hope to do is disable them from the OS, however, that's an all or nothing proposition.  The kexts are for all of the ports; not for each port.\n\nI am pretty much certain that my upper left port is not functioning well, sometimes it works and sometimes I have rotate the charging pin and insert it again to make it work,\n\nHave you tested the cable?  The port is reversible so you shouldn't need to \"rotate the charging pin;\" there's actually two of them - one on each \"side\" of the cable (Vbus).  If it is the port, why disable it?  Why not just not use it or better yet, take it in to have the port replaced?  There are board level repair outfits that specialize in this type of repair.\n\nNow, if you are getting CPU spikes then it is possible there's a short between one of the power pins and a data bin (i.e. Vbus and TX1/RX1).  If these spikes occur while a cable is plugged in, again, try changing the cable.  If they occur regardless, then the problem is your port and it must be fixed.  If it's a physical problem, you either have to physically disable it (cut the connectors so it's no longer usable) or if you're going to go that far, just fix the port.\n", "Q: Delete a specific key value using the defaults delete command line tool Having the following .plist file:\n/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist\n\n{\n    DisabledPreferencePanes =     (\n        \"com.apple.preference.general\",\n        \"com.apple.preference.mouse\"\n    );\n}\n\nUsing the defaults command line tool, if I want to delete for example only the com.apple.preference.mouse line from the plist how do I do that?\n\nA: The output of the defaults command, in your OP, shows a single key, DisabledPreferencePanes, as an array with two elements. Unfortunately defaults cannot explicitly delete a single element in an array containing multiple elements, in this case com.apple.preference.mouse.\nSince the target com.apple.systempreferences.plist file in /Library/Preferences only has the single key as an array, the entire file and thus the array can be overwritten without the target element in the array, e.g.:\n    NOTE: This form of the command overwrites the entire target file.\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist '{ DisabledPreferencePanes = (\"com.apple.preference.general\"); }'\n\nIf the target .plist file had other keys, you could overwrite just the target key, e.g:\n    NOTE: This form of the command overwrites just the target array.\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist DisabledPreferencePanes -array com.apple.preference.general\n\nThat said, I prefer to use PlistBuddy because a single element of the array can be deleted, e.g.:\nsudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Delete :DisabledPreferencePanes:1\" /Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*In PlistBuddy, array items are specified by a zero-based integer index.\n\nPlistBuddy can also be easier to use in a shell script where one could code it to find a target element of an array and delete it. This could not be done with defaults as it can only write (or overwrite) an array without the target element in it.\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences should be closed when modifying its releated .plist files.\n\n\n*Immediately after modifying the target file, in this use case, you need to terminate all occurrences of cfprefsd.\n\n*\n\n*As one is owned by root you'll need to use sudo in Terminal, e.g.:\nsudo killall cfprefsd\n\n\n\n*If you do not do this, the edited file may/will be overwriten by its original copy in memory, thus making the changes null and void.\n\n\n\n\n*cfprefsd will reload on its own afterwards.\n", "Q: Convince macOS Catalina that there is Internet command-line There are several ways to provide your MacBook Pro with Internet via some obscure socket, typically using OpenVPN, complemented by stubby for dns-over-tls. This works in Terminal\nHowever, other GUI apps refuse to recognize that Internet is available because of how macOS detects connectivity.

The Internet, to your computer, is nothing special.  It is to you can me, but to your computer, it’s just another network.\nAs far as DNS goes, it’s not required for Internet access.  As long as you can route packets from one IP addresses to another on the public network called the Internet, you’re connected.  DNS is required for convenience so you can associate a name with an IP.  It makes using the Internet easier.  However, it’s no different than how your local network works - you don’t need a DNS resolver (mDNS), but it sure makes it easier to remember the names of your computers than it is to remember each individual IP.\nmacOS or your apps (including the GUI) isn’t “aware” of the Internet.  Your GUI has nothing, actually, to do with the network or the Internet.  The GUI will still function whether or not it is connected.  The GUI, however, will make things convenient for you; ;it tells you that you have Internet by (macOS) sending out a simple IGMP packet (like a ping) to a known server and if a response comes back, it tells you that it’s connected to the Internet.  That “little green dot” in Network Preferences is nothing special.  It’s just an indicator for you that you have Network Connectivity (not Internet) and that your Network is working as it should.\nThe error message in your browser, “ERR NAME NOT RESOLVED” means whatever you typed, DNS was not able to find.  That doesn’t mean your Internet is not working nor are there special or obscure sockets incorrectly configured.   There are any number of reasons that you’ve received that error message from not being connected to the network, to the Internet being down, to having stale DNS entries requiring a flush, etc.  When you run into issues like this, the quickest way to resolve is to simply reboot.\n", "Q: How to make Mac OS incompatible mouse work on Mac OS and use ALL its buttons? Tell me your solution please I have a wonderful Roccat Tyon mouse (this is not a promo, I honestly love this product after trying a bunch of other gaming mouses) which I use for work, not for gaming. And I use it on the Mac OS which apparently is not supported by Roccat so no drivers or software (shame on you Roccat). Luckily mouse can store all the bindings in internal memory and don't need to rely on system drivers. I tried several workarounds to make my mouse work on Mac. I'll post my solutions just in case it might help someone on the Mac to use this great mouse. And if you're also the one who uses this or similar mouse on the Mac, please share your experience because I haven't yet found a really smooth solution.\n1. Binding direct shortcuts on Windows for later use on the Mac. It's usable and stable though for any change you have to run Windows and apply any changes there.\n2. Binding direct input events to mouse buttons and later triggering certain shortcuts on Mac OS side. Initially, I chose to bind direct input (or xinput) events to the mouse buttons because I though that keyboard buttons bindings would cause conflicts. And after binding on Windows side I installed ControllerMate on Mac OS and it worked great and allowed much flexibility though was to complex for simple bindings. Also there are just 12 xinputs events available and the mouse has much more buttons.\nAt some point I realized that ControllerMate is capable of distinguish inputs from different keyboards and I thought that an ideal solutions would be binding just plain letters A,B,C... to the mouse buttons. And I tried that and found an annoying bug. \"A\" detected as \"C\" and all the buttons had that strange offset of 2 letters.\n3. Binding plain letters A,B,C... to the mouse buttons and react on them on Mac OS side. Finally, so far I settled on binding plain letters and using BetterTouchTool which also allows distinguishing between input sources (without much control though). It does its job but \"input sources distinguishing\" functionality is pretty unstable and the app sometimes requires rebinding shortcuts, restarting it, or resaving some settings.\nI would really like to hear from you if you've dealt with similar issues with unsupported devices. Setting something like a mouse for comfortable work obviously should not take so much time and effort. (If you know another great mouse also please share.)\n\nA: The preeminent tool for wrangling USB devices on macOS is USB Overdrive.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.usboverdrive.com/\nIt will be hard to know all your buttons and Mac versions, but start there for sure.

I have a MacBook Pro 2018 with Catalina (1920x1080px) and a 2nd external monitor (3440x1440px) arranged as below in Displays. I understand that there are scale options to change the resolutions but I don't want to actually scale them because then I lose screen width and height.\nCurrently the mouse can only move between the connected edges of the two screens. It stops if I try to move it down on the right half of the larger screen.\nWhat I would like to do is move the mouse proportionally so the mouse can move smoothly between the screens without stopping one half. I could see this working two ways\n\n*\n\n*The simpler solution would be for the mouse to consider the last 1520 pixels of the larger screen to be all above the edge of the smaller screen so if you move down, the mouse just moves to the right side of the smaller screen. (I feel like this is simpler anyway, no idea)\n\n*The other better solution would be for the mouse to associate every 1.79 pixel column with a pixel column below. This way when you move down at pixel 1790 on the large screen, it ends up at pixel 1000 on the small screen.\n\nAre there any apps or tools that can accomplish either or both options?\n\nAs an example, here are two Windows apps that seems similar to what I want:\n\n*\n\n*MouseTrap\n\n*LittleBigMouse.\n\nSo at the very least, this seems possible\n\nA: Try cursr, it's new, probably more features coming out soon, I've been using it on mac, works so far.\nYou can also request new features, it has link to git in 'issues' section at the bottom. Small downside is that it's larger in size (but on desktop I dont see it as an issue), but that's entirely due to it being built with electron, for cross-platform support.\n\nA: \nCurrently the mouse can only move between the connected edges of the two screens.\n\nThis is by design.\n\nWhat I would like to do is have one essentially fake being scaled so the mouse can move smoothly between the screens without stopping one half.\n\nYou can't fake anything because that's not how things work.  Scaling is related to how the video resolution is displayed. Your mouse is tracked on an [X,Y] coordinate system for each display.  Your lower (smaller) screen only being half as wide cannot be \"faked\" so the mouse thinks it's 2X from where it actually is.\nFor example, if it were possible, then if you happened to be at [1,1080] (bottom left) on the upper screen, your fakery would mean as you moved to the lower, you'd be on [2,0] (top left) on the lower.  If you were to implement this to make your screens line up where they don't they actually wouldn't line up where they do.\n\nA: Haven't come across any tools that do what you've described out of the box.\nThat said, if the goal is to move the cursor to another screen or more generally to control the cursor, I'd say check out BetterTouchTool as it allows you to \"warp\" your mouse position. Alternatively, if you're willing to write some Lua, I'd say take a look at Hammerspoon.\n", "Q: What does this icon showing corners of a rectangle with a star on some of my photos mean? \nI have an iPhone 11 Pro Max running the latest iOS, and some of my photos have this icon in the top right corner.

The case itself has no connectivity and the AirPods within the case are turned off when the case is closed, so the case must be open for the AirPods to be reporting their location.\n\n*Find My does not support finding and sharing the location of AirPods that are not ‘yours’ paired with a device logged into the same primary iCloud account.\n\nThis means if there is no last location for the AirPods, for a new location to be reported, AirPods must be with some charge, out of the case or with the case open, and in range of one of your devices.\nApple has a support article on this topic: How to find your lost AirPods.\n", "Q: Will enabling FileVault convert my HFS+ disk to APFS? I have a 2017 5K iMac running Mojave 10.14.6.  It has a 2 TB Fusion drive internally formatted as HFS+.  FileVault is not enabled, but I wish to do so.  Will the disk have its format changed to APFS if I enable FileVault?\nMy recollection is that the disk was originally formatted as HFS+ from the factory and when I turned on FileVault, the format changed to APFS.  Granted that was over a year ago, so I could be very off-base.\nI want to prevent going to APFS again.  The performance degraded to dismal levels.  Now that I have reformatted as HFS+, it is surprisingly speedy.\n\nA: FileVault and APFS are two very different things; enabling one doesn’t enable (or necessitate) enabling the other.\nFileVault is encryption - it scrambles, to put it simply - the contents of your drive with a known key.  Specifically, it uses a 128-bit AES encryption with a 256-bit key.  See Use FileVault to encrypt the startup Disk for additional details.  You can encrypt journaled HFS+ (JHFS+) formatted volumes as well as APFS volumes.\nAPFS (Apple File System) is simply Apple’s next generation file system.

So this is about an old MacBook Pro - just old enough to have user replaceable memory.\nThe memory usage usually stays in the green, but the size of the Cached Files + Memory Used usually adds up to the total memory. My guess is the computer tries to keep some RAM free for working.\nI notice some lag in switching apps when many are open - even though memory usage is in the green.\nDoes this warrant increasing the RAM to 16GB from 8?\nAttached are  pics - one from htop and another from the activity monitor, and another from top, to show the usage.\n\n\n\n\nA: In general, operating systems tend to work towards having \"cache + memory used\" equal the actual amount of physical memory. The more that is cached, the greater the likelihood that certain operations can be sped up.\nIn general having more RAM means that the operating system with the same work load is able to cache more things, which could potentially speed some operations up. It is not however an indicator that you \"need\" more RAM as such.\nHowever, your screenshots does indicate that you're using 1.8 GB of swap. That could be an indicator that more RAM is necessary. Coupled with the fact that you experience a lag when switching apps - it does sound likely that more RAM could be helpful.\nI would try using the Terminal and running the command top. It will show a list of processes running on your Mac, and at the top it will list the number of \"swapins\" and \"swapouts\". If you have top running in a visible window, and then try switching between the apps that you use - then check if the those two numbers start rising when you experience the lag. If that's the case, I think a RAM upgrade would most probably improve the situation.\n\nA: I would definitely recommend getting 16 GB for your Mac. It's a relatively cheap investment to increase the performance of your Mac by removing a possible bottleneck.\nYou don't say what OS you're on or what apps/tasks you do, but certainly my own experience is that 8 GB is somewhat limiting.\nIf you haven't already, you should also fit an SSD instead of the hard drive.\n", "Q: How to use script to open an app if it's not the front most app, and hide it when it is the front most app in macos?

As soon as I disconnect the power adapter, the Mac stops working and shuts down.\nI ran the  diagnostics and the response codes were PPP003 and PPT006.\nI tried different things to identify the problem:-\nchanged the power adapter, it's still the same.\nCleaned the contacts between power adapter and macbook pro, it's still the same.\nReset SMC, it's still the same.\nReset PRAM, it's still the same.\nPlease help me out!!!\n\nA: The response codes from Apple Diagnostics are listed in https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203747:\n\n*\n\n*PPP003: There may be an issue with the power adapter. Disconnect the MagSafe power adapter from the computer and the power outlet, then reconnect. Run the test again.\nIf this code appears a second time, further troubleshooting may be required. Contact Apple or take your computer to an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple Retail Store to determine which service and support options are available.\n\n\n*PPT006: The battery requires service. The battery is not functioning normally, though you may not notice a change in its behavior or the amount of charge it holds. You can continue to use your battery before it’s checked without harming your computer.\nContact Apple or take your computer to an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple Retail Store to determine which service and support options are available.\nSo there still seems to be a problem either with the power adapter or the battery. Without access to the hardware it's impossible to analyze this further so it's probably best to visit the Apple Store again.\n", "Q: Finding a drive adapter to re-use the old hard drive from a Macbook Pro early 2015 13\" I recently upgraded the hard-drive on my Macbook Pro 13\" early 2015 model. I'd like to use the old 128gb hard-drive as an external USB disk, but I'm having trouble finding the adapter to make it a USB drive. This MacBook Pro uses a proprietary storage drive connector.\nSo far I've bought the wrong adapter (for M.2 drives to fit the Macbook, which is the wrong direction.)\n\nThe model number of the old hard-drive is MZ-JPV1280/03 (Samsung).\nI have this NGFF-to-USB3 box standing by:\n\n\nA: It is quite possible that there may not be an adaptor.

After about a month, the TimeMachine disk is full. I last formatted the disk August 19th, and now (September 10th) the disk is full. I can see about 490 backup snapshots, give or take every hour.\nThe TimeMachine disk is an SSD, formatted Mac OS Extended & Encrypted.\nWhat could be causing this and what else could I try to get TimeMachine to thin out backups as it used to?\n\nA: I gave up trying to fix this directly, but after upgrading to macOS 11, and using the same SSD freshly formatted with APFS - as now supported in macOS 11 - TimeMachine is back to working as it should, with hourly snapshots being cleared out after 24hrs.\nI can't say if the upgrade cleared out something corrupted, or if macOS 11 can now deal with the issue I was having, but it did fix things.\n", "Q: Can anyone explain to me the difference between terminal apps, CLI, CLT and Prompt? I wish to understand at a conceptual level, the difference between a terminal app, Command Line Interface (CLI), Command Line Tools (CLT) and Prompt. I am confused as to what the difference is between them?\nThe thing that threw me off was realizing that Apple does not ship macOS with CLT (Command Line Tools) pre-installed, and I have to download and install it separately. Doesn't that mean that Terminal.app is useless unless I download the CLT?\nI am using zsh as my shell running on macOS Catalina 10.15.6.\nClarification\nMy confusion is stemming from Xcode CLT. I don't understand what a CLT is?\n\n*\n\n*Is Xcode CLT a compiler? And if it is built into macOS, why do I need to download Xcode's CLT?\n\n\n*Why do I need an app like Terminal.app to access the CLI. Isn't the CLI an interface to begin with?\n\n\n*Does Homebrew (which is a package manager) considered a CLT that has its own CLI that I interact with using Terminal?\nI can't seem to wrap my head around these concepts and the connection between them.\n\nA: Adding to the answers already given, I want to give a bit more detail on the distinction between (physical) terminals and terminal emulators.\nPhysical terminals can be imagined as special typewriters that communicated via serial, hence Tele-Typewriter, or, TTY for short. This was in the age where multiple users shared one big server (e.g. in a university) and logged into that central point via their terminal endpoint which provided an interface to the system.\nWith the age of personal computing, but before graphical user interfaces, the  terminal and the terminal server merged into one device. To preserve the same environment, the computers added virtual terminals, or VT. On Linux you can access VT1–7 via the key combination Control + Alt + Shift + Fx.\nOn macOS you can enable your login mask to not show you the available users but instead provide a text input field. If you type >console as user you will be then dumped into a \"full screen\" text only virtual terminal. As these VTs emulate the serial line and limited input/output of physical terminals they have rather similar restrictions.\nWith the age of graphical user interfaces, the GUI desktop replaced the VT. In order to still be able to run CLI tools, Terminal Emulators were developed which are graphical applications/windows designed to connect to what is called pseudo terminals (PTY), which are essentially headless and ad-hoc creatable VTs.\nThis is why we have abbreviations such as TTY, VT and PTY which all describe rather similar, yet slightly different, things.\n\nA: CLI (Command Line Interface) is a general description of an interface that you interact with by typing commands. On the Mac your primary CLI is Terminal.app. On Windows it is PowerShell or Command Prompt. On the old Amiga OS it is simply called \"CLI\".\nTerminal is the program or application (\"app\") that is used to access the Command Line Interface. On macOS terminal is located in the /Applications/Utility folder and called Terminal.app. There are alternate terminal applications (on macOS and Linux/Unix) that provide other features in the same way that Apple's Pages app offers word processing features presented in and implemented in different way that Microsoft Word.\nCommand Line Tools Are indeed shipped with and easily accessible in macOS using the Terminal.app. Since macOS is based (originally) on the Berkeley Standard Distribution Unix (usually called BSD Unix, or just BSD), it comes with (pretty much) the standard suite of Unix command line tools. This will be similar (with some significant differences) to the command line tools shipped with most Linux distributions.\nShell Though you did not mention this it is important to understand that macOS (and many Unix and Linux distributions) ship with a number of shell programs. Until recently macOS shipped with BASH as the default shell, more recently changed to ZSH, though BASH is still available. The differences in shells are subtle (to casual users) but define, in (slightly) different ways, the environment we use to run the command line tools. For most people the actual shell you use is unimportant. For programmers and system administrators the shell they use is vitally important to provide a customizable environment suitable to their specific needs.\nPrompt is the character or characters that the shell presents in the terminal.app to indicate it is waiting for input. EG it is prompting you to type something. I have modified my prompt from the default so yours will look different than mine (below) where the prompt character is %:\n\nTDLR\nYou have the command line tools built-into macOS. They are accessed using the Terminal.app (that then uses the ZSH shell).\nYou can download other standard Unix versions of these commands if the current ones don't do the job you want, the way you want them to, or are just plain missing. One of the more popular repositories of open source commands is Homebrew.\nHomebrew is by no means necessary to the functioning of macOS but depending on your needs and desires in an operating system, they may provide good (or just familiar) alternatives to what Apple ships with its operating systems.\n\nA: Adding to the excellent answer by Steve Chambers:\nHistorically, the term Terminal was used to refer to a communication device that lets user interact with a centralized computer. A terminal provided an input/output device in the form of a keyboard and display.\nThe days of mainframes with remote access are no more, and, with almost everyone having access to a fully capable computer of their own with dedicated CPU and memory, usage of the term Terminal is now a misnomer, and thus, it's more appropriate to use the term Terminal Emulator as the Terminal.app is emulating a terminal device and the same macOS operating system which is running the Terminal.app is also running the shell program with which the user actually interacts.\nThus, in the current age where we no longer use real terminals, the term terminal refers in short to a Terminal Emulator.\nmacOS comes with a built-in terminal emulator called Terminal.app, however, there are 3rd party alternatives available with extended feature set. One such very popular 3rd-party terminal emulator program is iTerm2.\nCommand Line Interface or CLI for short is a general term to refer to a computer user interface where the primary mode of interaction is via typing commands which adhere to a specific syntax. It is in contrast to the Graphical User Interface or GUI which is prevalent in modern day computing devices.\nWhile macOS comes pre-installed with a variety of UNIX command line tools, Apple's Command Line Tools or CLT is the term used to refer to a specific installable package made available by Apple for software developers. CLT, in addition to the UNIX tools pre-installed in macOS, installs macOS SDK, headers, and build tools such as Apple LLVM compiler and Make. It enables developers to build and install open source software. For details, refer to this link: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/\nIt's worth noting that the term Command Line Tool can be interpreted in two ways. Command Line Tools is a software package made available by Apple which contains a specific set of items. Command Line Tool(s) in general could be used to refer to any tool/app which is interacted with via a command line interface (Homebrew is latter of the two). And any command line app can be in general be referred to as a command line tool. (Just like how Apple uses the term App Store to refer to their marketplace for iOS apps, while the same term could also be used in a generic way).\nPrompt or Command Prompt is another commonly used term to refer to the command line interface. A prompt is generally used to indicate the location for users to input command line (i.e. sequence of characters describing the entire command). A command prompt may use a special character to give some idea about the shell in use or the logged in user. E.g., BASH shell uses $ for the prompt character, while ZSH uses % for the prompt character. Prompt for the root user is almost always #. A prompt is generally followed by a blinking cursor to indicate the place for text entry.\nHere's a depiction of a command prompt running BASH shell in Terminal.app in macOS for a non-root user. The part underlined in green indicated the prompt in the shell which is accessed by the user using the Terminal app:\n\n\nTo answer your specific questions:\n\nThe thing that threw me off was realizing that Apple does not ship macOS with CLT (Command Line Tools) and I have to download it.\n\nmacOS doesn't ship with Apple's CLT because most users of Mac (even most software developers) would never ever need it. And once you have a need for Apple's Command Line Tools, Apple has made it very easy to install them.\n\nDoesn't that mean that Terminal is useless unless I download CLT?\n\nTerminal is very much useful and usable for a variety of tasks, even for many software developers even without Apple's Command Line Tools installed. Most software developers would never install Command Line Tools and yet they can access any one of the built-in shells, run shell internal commands, execute shell scripts, run one of the numerous, pre-installed external commands etc. Only for the developers needing access to specific tools provided by CLT, would they need to obtain them by installing it.\n\nIs it a compiler? And if it is built in macOS, why do I need to download Xcode's CLT?\n\nNo CLT is not a compiler, or aptly speaking, it contains a compiler (Apple LLVM) as one of the apps in its package of tools. Command Line Tools have been aptly described by Apple here:\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need an app like Terminal to access the CLI. Isn't the CLI an interface to begin with?\n\nInstalling Apple's Command Line Tools installs a package containing header files, SDKs and various command line apps in macOS. Terminal.app is then used as an interface to gain access to the tools themselves.\n\nDoes Homebrew (which is a package manager) considered a CLT that has its own CLI that I interact with using Terminal?\n\nHomebrew is a community developed, open source, 3rd-party package manager which makes it simple to manage installation of command line apps/utilities which Apple doesn't ship. It takes away the hassle of compiling/installing/configuring/managing/uninstalling a variety of open source command line utilities, which could be a hassle for a majority of users (software developers included).\nHomebrew itself becomes available to users as a external command itself that lets them manage other command line utilities. It is an app/utility which is different from Apple provided Command Line Tools.\n(To further clear any confusion, when referring to Apple's Command Line Tools, it is implied that one is talking about the specific package containing multiple tools made available by Apple, though the term itself sound pretty generic (like other terms Apple use such as App Store). Apple's Command Line Tools should not be confused with command line tools when referenced to in general)\n\nA: \nIs it[CLT] a compiler? And if it is built in macOS, why do I need to download Xcode's CLT?\n\nAs the name suggests, they're a collection of tools like git, svn, ranlib, ar, Clang compiler, GCC compiler etc. The CLT in /Library/CommandLineTools lacks xcodebuild for eg., which some apps need to compile their code\n\n*\n\n*ERROR: 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode\n\n*How do I solve the problem of “invalid active developer path” when attempting to use Git on VSCode\nI'd say Xcode ones are the complete ones. BUT you don't need Xcode for normal functioning of your Mac and if you don't write code for macOS, iOS, WatchOS or TvOS.\n\nWhy do I need an app like Terminal to access the CLI. Isn't the CLI an interface to begin with?\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface\nYou can have multiple Terminal-like apps like iTerm2 etc.\n\nDoes Homebrew (which is a package manager) considered a CLT that has its own CLI that I interact with using Terminal?\n\nBrew also has many of the open source tools which come in macOS CLT or Xcode CLT. However Apple's proprietary SDKs can only be found in macOS/ Xcode CLTs. I haven't seen anyone referring to brew's packages as CLT. It'll simply be ambiguous.\n\n*\n\n*What are pros and cons for MacPorts, Fink and Homebrew?\n\n*Installing stuff: brew vs. official installer - which one should be used?\n\nA: Why do I need an app like Terminal to access the CLI. Isn't the CLI an interface to begin with?\nAn interface is a method that applications use to channel information between you and the computer. Finder is an application that uses a graphical interface (at one point called a WIMP interface -- Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer.)\nCLI (Command Line Interface) is a method or mode of operating that an application like Terminal can use. Of course, technically, Terminal uses multiple windows, and WIMP elements like drag-and-drop.\n", "Q: Strange screen on MacBook Air (2016) Recently my MacBook Air (2016) has been randomly giving me this screen. Longest it’s ever lasted was a minute. One time I had to shut down the computer to get it to go away, another time it went away on its own.

The settings stored in NVRAM depend on your Mac and the devices that you're using with your Mac.\nShut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.\n\nA: this happens some time to time, at least with my macbook air which is a year younger then yours. i found this to happen when switching to fullscreen or airplay. also since that time my computer needs a replacement. my suggestion is: that you get a good refurbished mac.\n", "Q: Left shift key outputs ± When I press the left shift key a ± appears on the screen.

I am using a matias keyboard. It is a $100 keyboard from Fry's.  Pretty high end; the action is really good.\n[EDIT] I plugged in an old MS keybaord I had laying around.  IT was working when I traded up to the new keyboard. IT throws garbage on the screen when I press the shift keys.\n\nA: Solved: For my Matias keyboard, the Mac combination for NumLock is simply the 'Clear' key.  Simply pressing the 'Clear' key resolved the issue!\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSo ±I have this same problem with a ±Matias keyboard.  ±At first ±I thought the ±Num ±Lock was pressed, as there is no numlock on the keyboard.  ±Funny thing is that my keyboard is Bluetooth and was connected to Windows 10.  Both the Windows and ±Mac exhibited this same behavior.±\n±Pressing 'fn + N' on the keyboard stopped the behavior on Windows, but not my ±Mac ±(as you can see from this post±).  The best part is that pressing Shift on my ±MacBook's built-in keyboard does not insert ±!\n±Checked keyboard mappings and nothing seems to be set incorrectly.  Reconnected my ±Bluetooth connection to a different key ±(keyboard has 4±), and still have the same problem.  ±I'll probably let the battery drain on my keyboard and see if that resets it.\nThanks to da4 for the keyboard mapping for the normal ±.\n\nA: I went and bought a new keyboard and it works fine.\nI had my friend plugin my broken keyboards and they have similar behavior on his Windows 10 PC (garbage on the shift keys).\nI consider this solved but I am stumped that I have two keyboards with similar failure.\nI would delete this question but there are other people reporting the ± on the left shift key too so I am just going to leave this question undeleted.\n\nA: By default on macOS, typing  ⌥ Option ⇧ Shift = (equal key not on an extended/numeric keyboard) results in the plus-minus sign (±).  It seems likely that one of the keys being used as Option was stuck.\nSince a second external keyboard also created unexpected results, it's possible that the stuck or malfunctioning Option key is on the laptop's internal keyboard.\n", "Q: How can I rename the servers names found in Screen Sharing \"Open Recent....\" menu? I connect to a handful of macs via Screen Sharing. After connecting for the first time, the name and port are remembered by the app and are displayed at the \"Open Recent...\" menu.\nWhile this is helpful, the displayed names are out of my control and sometimes make no sense to me or they are basically the same.\nI would like to rename them to something that has a meaning to me. How can I do this?\n\nA: While it seems to be impossible to change Screen Sharing, you could simply create link files and put them in a folder.\nThe easiest way I could find on how to do this is to type the link in a text file (vnc://user@ip:port), select said text and drag it to the desktop. It will create a file that when clicked will open Screen Sharing.\nThanks to Steve Chambers for the idea.\n\nA: To change the name(s) shown in Screen Sharing > Connection > Open Recent, as in the image below, you'd edit the filename(s) in the following location:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ScreenSharing/Data/Library/Application Support/Screen Sharing/\n\nFiles at this location are XML plist files having a vncloc extension.\nWith Screen Sharing closed, I changed the original name from what it was to what's shown in the image. When I opened Screen Sharing the renamed vncloc file showed as is.\n\n", "Q: Calibrating battery on a Macbook: am I supposed to keep the computer running all the time? I've been advised in a lot of places (for example: https://www.lifewire.com/calibrate-macbook-air-battery-2260856) to calibrate my Macbook Air's battery from time to time: every three months or so, keep it running until the battery dies, then turn it off and charge it completely again. This allows the battery to give you more accurate readings of the power left.\nBut it has just occurred to me: when doing this, am I supposed to keep the computer running all the time? Or can I close the lid and let it sleep (without plugging it in) for some of that time? After all, it's kind of hard to keep the Macbook on for 11 hours...\n\nA: It doesn't matter how the battery runs down; there's no difference whatsoever in the battery (or the computer) when your battery is depleted when the computer is running or when it's asleep.  The battery's charge level will fall below the voltage necessary to power on your laptop - one way is just faster than the other.  So, bottom line is that either way is fine - which ever you are comfortable with.\n", "Q: What's special about /Applications on macOS Catalina?

Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\n\nIt is important that I recover my data. I have an old time machine backup if that would help in any way. Is there a way to use it or an external drive to somehow get the files if they still exist?\n\nA: Partial answer: boot into recovery mode and open disk utility.

If possible, what would be the way to achieve it?\nSheets don't have the same records nor rows in the same order so I can't just copy and paste a column to use a formula with relative cell positions.\n\nA: So match() will do this.\nMATCH() has three arguments:\nSearch_for : the sku you want to check from col N sheet 1\nSearch_where : column B on sheet 2\ntype of match : need 0 for exact match\nNot built an example as your data is in images.\n\nA: Your use of match() is relevant but index() is better suited than address() and together they make for a flexible lookup tool. Essentially, match() finds the row with your SKU while index() fetches the corresponding discount. We also can use if() and iserror() to handle unmatched SKUs. Your images don't lend themselves to solving this concisely so I'll use a smaller layout (plus I'm not really sure what should go where).\nThis formula should go in cell C5 of table 1:\nIF(ISERROR(MATCH(A5,SKU,0)),0,INDEX(Table 2::C$1:C$7,MATCH(A5,SKU,0),1,area-index))\nThen, in cell D5, put this:\nPrice CL8016 SG OPT 01−(Price CL8016 SG OPT 01×MD CL8016 SG OPT 01)\nAn easier rendering would be: D5 = B5 - (B5 * C5)\nWhat they do:\nC5 first checks to see if there is a matching SKU in table 2 with MATCH(A5,SKU,0). If not it generates an error, if yes it generates a table 2 row number. The if() function takes the results of iserror() then returns a 0 discount if an error or (via index function) the corresponding discount from table 2 column C.\nD5 subtracts the discount amount from the price.\nE5 shows how iserror() works with ISERROR(MATCH(A5,SKU,0)).\nNB, I managed to upload the bleeping image \n", "Q: Is imklaunchagent virus or Apple system file? My client suspects the imklaunchagent damages his computer. I did some research but found two explanations. One is Apple's system file and the other is virus. Which one is true?\nApple System File?\nclaim 1\n\nman imklaunchagent\" in Terminal.app says:\nimklaunchagent is automatically invoked to launch input methods that\nare selected via direct user inter- action.

I want to expand window of an app in macOS, but I don't want to go into fullscreen mode.\nIs this possible somehow by clicking some button?\nOh nvm, I can double click the application bar.. and it expands fully.\n\nA: What you are looking for is called the \"Zoom\" command. It resides in the \"Window\" menu in an app like Chrome. You can assign a keyboard shortcut to \"Zoom\" and you will have a quick mouseless command for this.\nOR\nMove the cursor to any one of the four corners of the Window. When the cursor icon changes to a diagonal bi-directional arrow, press and hold the Option key and double click.\n\nThis would zoom the window to occupy the entire screen without it entering into full-screen mode.\nOR\nDouble click the application bar\n\nA: If you want this consistently, you will need to install a third party utility, like Rectangle, Magnet, Moom or several others.\nIn some cases you can hold Shift ⇧⃣ while clicking the green stoplight button to have a \"cover the whole screen, but don't go into full screen mode\" behavior, but this depends on the app.\nThe reason for this is that historically, macOS had no concept of windows covering the whole screen:\n\n*\n\n*In classic MacOS the  widget would make the window change to a size that is best fitting the content of the window. This could enlarge or shrink the window. You can check it out using an online emulation of System 6.\n\n\n*MacOS X changed the location and the appearance of the window widgets , but the green stoplight had the same behavior up until OS X 10.9 Mountain Lion.\n\n\n*MacOS X 10.7 Lion added a zoom widget at the right side of the window that would switch the window into full screen mode and back.\n\n\n*OS X 10.10 Yosemite replaced the default behavior of the green stoplight with \"full screen\". The previous \"best fitting size\" behavior was moved to two places:\n\n*\n\n*You could press Option ⌥⃣ while clicking on the green stoplight\n\n*You could double click the window title\n\n\n\nThis is the behavior up until macOS 10.16 Catalina, so this is what you are experiencing.\n", "Q: How to change the escape style when dropping paths into Terminal If I drop a file from Finder (or another file source) into the Terminal, the system helpfully escapes characters like spaces: Dropping a file named /Lorem Ipsum.txt yields /Lorem\\ Ipsum.txt.\nI would like to change this behavior to use quotation marks instead, so that /Lorem Ipsum.txt would yield '/Lorem Ipsum.txt' instead (note the single quotation marks and the missing backslash).\nIs there a way to do this using the standard Terminal.app? If not, is it maybe possible with iTerm or something else?\nEdit\nThe reason why I want to do this is that I am using xonsh that parses the backslash as a literal character, echo /Lorem\\ Ipsum.txt prints /Lorem\\ Ipsum.txt.\nMost of the time I will just manually delete the backslashes, and sometimes I use the following workaround:\n\n*\n\n*Enter @(r\"\n\n*Drop the file – this will fill a string literal with the path using backslash-escapes\n\n*Enter \".replace(\"\\\\\",\"\"))\n\nA: I can confirm that iTerm2 does exactly what you want in regards to enclosing long file names and directories with single quotes instead of escaping the spaces when dragging and dropping.  It does this by default.\nThere are many additional reasons and benefits to switch to iTerm2 from the default Terminal on macOS.  Far too many to list here.\nUpdate for iTerm 3.4\niTerm 3.4 changed the escaping behavior to use backslash escaping as well. However, there is an advanced experimental feature Escape file names with single quotes instead of backslashes. that reverts the escaping back. The comment even specifies my very use case: This is intended for users of xonsh, which does not accept backslash escaping.\n", "Q: macports mod_proxy configuration gives error AH01144 No protocol handler was valid for the URL .. scheme http I am trying to a reverse proxy to get Apache Jena Fuseki which will only work on localhost:3030 visible from my intranet.

Some generic brand bluetooth keyboard / mouse work fine on macos.

I have used a couple of Adobe apps on my iPad. Following the first time I logged in to my account, it just remembers the details.

Where exactly and how does Apple store these information? I do not have anything in the Autofill section or Password Manager (Keychain/Website and App passwords).\n\nA: Third party apps can securely store and retrieve the login session information in the iPad's keychain (which unlike macOS keychain is not user accessible). The apps often does that so that it makes it seamless for users to log into other app(s) from the same developer (Both Google and Adobe publish multiple apps on the App Store).\nYou can take either one of the approaches (as made available by the developer of the app) to disassociate iPad from your account or log out from iPad:\n\n*\n\n*Login to manage your account using a desktop web browser (such as for Google or Adobe), access the logged in devices and disassociate the device.\n\n\n*Get access to user account management within one of the apps on iPad and exercise the option to remove your account from log out from it.\nAn app developer would generally provide either one or both the options for users.\n", "Q: Magic Mouse2 keep loosing connection which keyboard and Magic Trackpad work fine I have a Magic Mouse 2, Magic Trackpad and Apple keyboard.

If your Mac can’t boot itself to internet recovery, you need to bring a bootable external OS to your Mac to fix it.\nYour Mac could run in target mode and you download the installer from another Mac or use another Mac or person to make you a new installer.\nApple documents these steps very well. All you have to do is choose what OS you want to reinstall over your existing to see if the data is still intact or if you just want to erase and set up new.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204267\nYou will have to know how to examine the install logs or make a second installer. Either your drive is broken and needs erase and repair or your installer is broken. Hard to tell without hands on and experience. It’s easy to repeat the install with a known good installer.

I want to write a script to change all my desktops/spaces' wallpaper to one picture every 5 minutes. (In linux, I use feh script to do it.)\nSo how to do it in MacOS Catalina(such as use shell or AppleScript)?\nTwo demands:\n\n*\n\n*The wallpapers of all spaces should change every 5 minutes.\n\n*The wallpapers of all spaces must be the same at the same time.\n\n*The wallpapers should change in random order.\n\nI've already tried this in system preference, but that doesn't work. The wallpaper would not change until you switch to the space, and the pictures will change independently so they're not in sync.\n\nA: To save anybody attempting it this way - it doesn't work.\nIf you don't switch to each space within every 5-minute time-window, they go out of sync again.\nJust to save anyone else messing around to discover the same thing.\nDon't bother voting this answer either way - it's just here for info.\n\nThis appears to be possible from the Screen Saver control panel, though it takes a little bit of juggling - basically you need to be able to do this before the next 5-minute marker on the clock to get them in sync, so start just after any 5-minute mark to have a better shot.\nOpen the Screen Saver control panel, set up your folder of choice as you would do ordinarily.\nCheck the box for Change picture.\n\nJust as you'd expect, so far…\nThen - hold the title bar of the control panel & hit your key command for the next space.\nAgain, select the folder & Check the box for Change picture\nRinse & repeat.\nIf you finish before the next 5-minute goes by on the clock, they will then stay in sync.\nWhat you will actually see as you later switch to each space is the crossfade as it switches to the next image. I don't know if that is adjustable anywhere. Such transitions sometimes have a defaults read/write, but I don't know for this.\nIf you have dual monitors with linked spaces, you must do this for each of the two control panels that pop up, one on each screen. They drag independently, which makes it a bit more of a rush.\n", "Q: How to disable the now default \"ambient noise reduction\" in macOS Catalina? In macOS Catalina, ambient noise reduction is applied by default to audio of an external source coming in through the headphone jack. This is not always desired, e.g. when recording musical instruments. In previous versions of macOS, noise reduction could be disabled via System Preferences. However, this option is not present in Catalina. This thread proposes downgrading to Mojave as a solution to the problem (which it is), though this is not desirable for me as I need Catalina for other reasons.\nAs mentioned in the thread, Apple's audio documentation specifies that ambient noise reduction is disabled if a 4-channel built-in microphone format is selected in Audio MIDI Setup. Unfortunately, my external audio source only supports 2 channels, so this option is unavailable in Audio MIDI Setup.\nMy guess is that the solution is any of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Some terminal command to disable ambient noise reduction entirely.\n\n*Modifying some plist, e.g. in /Library/Preferences/Audio/.\n\nHowever, I have not yet managed to find a solution, and would greatly appreciate it if anyone could think along. Thanks.\n\nA: Sometimes the best solution... is a little patience! I have recently updated to MacOS Big Sur (11.0.1), and the checkbox to disable ambient noise reduction is available again in the sound input settings.\nHowever, there is a caveat: the toggle is available only to a subset of devices. Please note the following, stated on Apple's website:\n\nCapture less background noise when using your computer’s built-in\nmicrophone: Select “Use ambient noise reduction”. This option does not\nappear if a 4-channel built-in microphone format is selected in Audio\nMIDI Setup or on Mac models with an Apple T2 chip.\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/mac-help/mchlp2567/mac\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 16 2019 + External Monitor.

I have a few photo bursts in Photos.app version 5 (macOS Catalina), and Photos.app identifies them as bursts, but I cannot find any tool in the interface to select one picture in the burst or even to view them all. I don't remember if the bursts were taken with my iPhone or with a Sony a6000, and surprisingly, it does not tell in the info of the photos.\n\nUPDATE:\nAlso, there is no Make Selection... button when I open the photo burst that appears, as was suggested in an answer below, or as I have seen in some tutorials. I don't know if this is caused my something particular with my pictures or if Photos.app version 5 is different.\n\n\nA: You need to change to your 'Library' (previously known as 'Photos') to reveal the \"Make a Selection…\" button. The button is missing with 'Imports' and maybe other lists of photos.\n\nA: Double click on it, click \"Make a Selection...\" on the top left corner, and you'll get an interface for that.\n\nA: Mac seems to be made not to provide support for burst photos. There is huge difficulty transporting burst photos from iphone to mac and mac has bugs to display which scenes are selected and which are not.\nMy suggestion is to ABANDON using burst photos completely, until Apple thinks it’s worthwhile to fix all the bugs.

I am using a Gaomon S620 graphics tablet and running macOS Catalina version 10.15.6, although my question doesn't, I think, depend on my specific tablet/OS version.\nIt used to be the case (before Mojave I think?) that you could plug a graphics tablet into a mac and it would immediately work fine with literally no driver installed. (No fine pressure control or whatever, but I don't need this.) Now I'm guessing that to due some added security restrictions, when I plug in my graphics tablet without downloading Gaomon's driver, my computer recognizes pen movement (the cursor moves), but I am unable to click on anything.\nI say that my specific model doesn't matter because many people have had this problem with different tablets:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/9003e4/intuos_pro_my_tablet_pen_hovers_just_fine_but/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/a62n30/tap_to_click_not_working_on_intuos_pro/\nhttps://www.gaomon.net/question/macos_mojave_catalina_solution.html\nI know how to solve this issue if I have Gaomon's driver downloaded. Go to Security and Privacy --> Accessibility, etc.\n(Basically follow the steps here and give your third-party driver access to your computer.)\nBut I want to use my graphics tablet without installing a third-party driver. Is there a way to reenable this functionality?\nFor reference, I am having problems with lag, and I want to check whether it is my driver's fault or if it is just due to high CPU usage. But I can't check because I can't use my graphics tablet anymore without the third-party driver.\nEdit: To clarify, I never experience lag (whether the Gaomon third-party driver is installed or not) when just moving the cursor. Lag only occurs when I press down and draw. But as stated above, I can only draw when the third-party driver is installed, as otherwise it doesn't recognize clicks.\n\nA: First, try adding the software you are using with the Tablet to Accessibility. Next, try to determine what is the default driver used by Catalina for your Tablet, and add that too (if possible) to Accessibility.\nWhile this issue is most probably due to architectural changes in Catalina, try disabling \"System Integrity Protection\" (SIP) and see if it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down the Command+R keys until the Apple logo appears on your screen.\n\n*Click Utilities -> Terminal.\n\n*In the Terminal window, type in csrutil disable and press Enter.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n\nBe sure to enable it again after you are done testing, following the same steps as above but using the command csrutil enable, once you are done testing.\nYou can use Activity Monitor to detect if high CPU is happening when you are using the Tablet.\n(Otherwise, inform the manufacturer of the tablet that you can't test what they are asking you to do because of macOS Catalina. You shouldn't need to jump through hoops for something they should be doing to ensure the product works as described on macOS, i.e. they should be the one testing the products thoroughly for mac.)\n\nA: I would bite the bullet and install the drivers.

I can control volume, but no audio is heard.\nAnyone can help me solving this?\n\nA: I was able to get this to work using a 2013 iMac in Target Display Mode. The 2013 iMac was connected to a 2011 iMac by a Thunderbolt cable. I needed to make sure muting was not checked off and the volume was up high enough on both the 2011 and 2012 iMacs.

I'm afraid it's not canceled.\nHow can I remove it totally? I have even removed the app. what should I do to get rid of it?\n\nA: According to Apple:\n\nTap Cancel Subscription. If you don’t see Cancel Subscription, the subscription is already canceled and won't renew.\n\nYou stated you don't see the Cancel Subscription button so that means it's already canceled. Cancelling means that it won’t renew now at the next interval. If you want to be very safe to double check, you could reinstall the app and delete it when connected to the internet.

I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my MacBook Air 2019 with Catalina 10.15.6. However, my MacBook has the secure boot feature which doesn't allow rEFInd to work at all and I'm not feeling comfortable to disable secure boot.\nIs there any way to dual boot without rEFInd?\n\nA: If you employ all the security offered by the T2 chip, then you can not boot Ubuntu. Also, you can not boot the Ubuntu Live USB flash drive to install Ubuntu. So with secure boot enabled, you can not install Ubuntu.\nIf you lower the security, then you can install and boot with or without using rEFInd. Installing Ubuntu to the internal drive of the newest Macs may not yet be possible.\nWith rEFInd, the following happens:\n\n*\n\n*The firmware boots rEFInd.\n\n*The user chooses Ubuntu from the rEFInd menu.\n\n*rEFInd instructs the firmware to boot Grub.\n\n*The firmware boots GRUB from the EFI partition.\n\n*Grub boots Ubuntu from a linux formatted partition.\n\nWithout rEFInd, the following happens:\n\n*\n\n*The user holds down the option key at startup until the firmware boots to the Mac Startup Manager.\n\n*The user chooses Ubuntu from the Startup Manager. (By default, the label is EFI Boot.)\n\n*The shim boot loader is booted from the EFI partition by the firmware.\n\n*The shim boot loader boots Grub from the EFI partition. Ubuntu is also made the default operating system to boot.\n\n*Grub boots Ubuntu from a linux formatted partition.\n\nThere is also option with rEFInd to do a Grubless boot of Ubuntu. In this case, the following happens.\n\n*\n\n*The firmware boots rEFInd.\n\n*A driver is installed by rEFInd that allows the firmware (and thus rEFInd) to read linux formatted partitions.\n\n*The user chooses Ubuntu from the rEFInd menu.\n\n*rEFInd instructs the firmware to boot Ubuntu from a linux formatted partition.\n\n*The firmware boots Ubuntu.\n\nThere are other scenarios for booting Ubuntu. The three given are fairly common.\n\nA: I recall being able to install Linux with Boot Camp but that was some time ago, my recollection may be incorrect and Boot Camp support from Apple has been fading in recent years.  Support for Boot Camp will end with the end of Intel based Macs, meaning not much effort has been put into keeping it updated, and there's nothing I've seen to suggest an equivalent technology for future ARM based systems.\nIs there a reason to dual boot as opposed to using a virtual machine?  I gave up on dual booting a very long time ago.  In that time computers got cheap enough, and reliable enough, that I can afford keeping an old computer (or seven) around for running whatever OS I want and avoid the need to reboot.  There's also been considerable advancements in virtual machine software.  I now routinely run one or two virtual machines on my newer computers.  This let's me flip between Linux, macOS, and Windows with a key macro instead of having to reboot or go to another computer.  This ability to run multiple operating systems also comes with the speed, low cost, and durability of modern computers.\nThe problem with the T2 chip and running Linux has little to do with rEFInd.  The problem is that with the T2 chip enabled only signed operating systems will boot.  I don't know if Apple bars Linux from being signed, nobody bothered to go through the process of signing the OS/kernel/whatever, or why the two don't meet.\nUntil there's a Linux OS that's \"blessed\" by Apple there's a choice you will have to make.  You can boot Linux with the T2 chip at lowered security settings.  You can run Linux in a virtual machine.  You can not run Linux on this computer.  If there's another choice then I'm not aware of it.\n", "Q: Workarounds for \"cp -p\" not preserving nanoseconds on High Sierra with APFS? I don't know if this affects MacOS versions newer than High Sierra, but it seems that cp -p won't preserve timestamps with nanoseconds resolution.\nBecause of this, the shell can wrongly tell that a file is older than other even if it was copied by cp -p. This breaks build system dependencies when some files were installed by cp -p: they keep reinstalling and reinstalling again because the nanoseconds don't match.\nCan you suggest some workaround for this? I thought compiling my own cp binary, but however cp is usually a shell builtin, and moreover I'm not aware of any nanosecond-preserving cp version out there.\nNote: I know of a workaround, but it's not reasonable: Execute touch on the source file before executing cp -p. Because touch doesn't preserve nanoseconds either, it makes them zero on the source file, so the result after cp -p guarantees exactly the same timestamp. However, as I said, it's not reasonable, because I don't like to touch files just for this: you lose their real last saved date.\n\nA: Good to know that I'm not the only one who thinks this is a problem. I ran into it while writing a Python script for monitoring parts of my macOS (10.15.7) filesystem, which also involved coping files. The script sometimes behaved erratic and produced unpredictable output. After some poking around I found out that the incapability of cp -p to preserve nanoseconds is the core of the problem.\nOne workaround for your problem (but not for mine) could be coreutils: gcp -p behaves as intended.\n\nA: I thought this was fixed in 10.15, but I just didn't repro the problem correctly. To save others the same embarrassment, here's a repro that shows the problem:\n% python3 -c 'open(\"file1\", \"w\")'\n% stat -f %Fm file1\n1609301645.481666557\n% cp -p file1 file2\n% stat -f %Fm file2\n1609301645.481666000\n\n", "Q: Create 2 resizable logical drives from one physical drive under Catalina I have partitioned a drive to create two logical partitions from one physical drive in the past, but the partitions were not resizable after I initially created them and it ended up being a nightmare to undo.\nI have a new MacBook Pro that I'd like to set up two logical drives that can be resized. What is the correct way to go about doing this? I see articles online about it, but they discuss El Capitan and older OSes.\n\nA: Here is Apple's guide on the much better way of using containers to hold all the space on a drive and then make resizable and shares space logical volumes.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/add-erase-or-delete-apfs-volumes-dskua9e6a110/mac\nIn practice this is so much better than the old way of having to guess beforehand how much space each needed and being forced to jump through hops to grow and shrink volumes. APFS does need SSD to run fast, but you gain so much flexibility to create new volumes it's worth selling an old Mac to get a new one IMO. I don't recommend this on Fusion Drives - there, try to void any split unless you can't get external SSD for a better APFS experience.\nIf you like hearing how this works, watch this video alerting at 12 minutes in on the benefits of space sharing...\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/wwdc17/715 Check out What's New in Apple File System\n\nAs to how to add, back to the first link.

In order for this example shell script to work you'll need to, at least temporarily, add Terminal to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access, and Terminal should be closed when you do.\n\n*When the example shell script is run, Safari should be closed as well, however, as coded it will close it if it's open. It will also open it after the changes have been made.\n\n*Because of other OS security measures, (sandboxing), the com.apple.Safari.plist file needs be copied to /tmp/, modified there, and then moved back. The shell script, as coded, handles this. The com.apple.Safari.SandboxBroker.plist file is modified in place.\n\n*As coded, the two PLIST files get backed up with a .bak extension, however the shell script can only be run one time unless the n is removed from cp -avn for both files, which will then overwrite the original backups!\n\n*As coded, it will output debugging information (set -x) and this is in case you have an issue you can copy and paste the output from Terminal for troubleshooting if need be. So, if there is an issue, do not close the window until it's copied and pasted elsewhere so I can see it.\n\nTo use the example shell script code:\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal and run the following compound command:\ntouch sdmcb; chmod u+x sdmcb; open -e sdmcb\n\n\n\n*Copy and paste the example shell script code into the opened sdmcb document, then save and close it.\n\n\n*Back in Terminal use the following command to run the shell script:\n./sdmcb\n\nThat's it, this will either work or it won't, it's the only thing I can think of trying, sans booting to macOS Recovery and deleting the two PLIST files which may remove a setting that's causing it to be inactive to begin with, if it's even in those two files.\n\nExample shell script code:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\nset -x\n\n[[ $(ps x | grep '[S]afari.app') == \"\"  ]] || killall Safari; sleep 2\ncd \"$HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/\" || exit\ncp -v 'com.apple.Safari.plist' '/tmp/' || exit\ncp -avn 'com.apple.Safari.plist' 'com.apple.Safari.plist.bak' || exit\ndefaults write '/tmp/com.apple.Safari.plist' \"IncludeDevelopMenu\" -bool 'yes'\ndefaults write '/tmp/com.apple.Safari.plist' \"WebKitDeveloperExtrasEnabledPreferenceKey\" -bool 'yes'\ndefaults write '/tmp/com.apple.Safari.plist' \"WebKitPreferences.developerExtrasEnabled\" -bool 'yes'\nmv -v '/tmp/com.apple.Safari.plist' .\ncd \"$HOME/Library/Preferences/\" || exit\ncp -avn 'com.apple.Safari.SandboxBroker.plist' 'com.apple.Safari.SandboxBroker.plist.bak' || exit\ndefaults write \"$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.SandboxBroker.plist\" \"ShowDevelopMenu\" -bool 'yes'\nkillall cfprefsd\nsleep 3\nopen -a \"/Applications/Safari.app\" \n\n\nA: Same issue here - in Big Sur\nNo terminal use / shell script use\nI manually removed all safari settings / cache / preference files\nhttps://macissues.com/2015/06/22/how-to-fully-reset-safari-on-your-mac/\nReinstalled Mac OS .\ncan now check \"Show Develop \"\n", "Q: MacBook shuts down at login screen I have an early 2015 MacBook Pro.

Quicktime Player allows a very nice workflow for recording audio for Google Slides – right up to the point where you try to insert the M4A audio file that comes out of Quicktime Player. Then Google refuses to play nicely and the workflow becomes ugly…\nPerhaps it's the smoke out here on the west coast, but my Google foo is failing to find any defaults settings that would change the format of the saved file (without having to go back and convert it).\nIs there any way to have the default format for audio recordings be MP3 instead of M4A?\n\nA: Sadly, QuickTime Player doesn't offer a good range of conversion formats. Your best option is either to record the audio in another application, like Sound Studio or Audacity; or post-process the audio file.\n\nA: You could convert it with Music.

One example is this page, originally in Japanese:\nhttp://immanuel.sakura.ne.jp/hoby/osakaben/osakaben.htm\nOn desktop one can simply ask the browser to reload the page with a different encoding, but I don't see this option in many iOS browsers. Is there an iOS browser out there that allows the user to manually select the encoding?\n\nA: A trick I often use is to go into the address bar to edit the page URL, adding cache: to the start of the URL so it begins cache:https://. This views the current page through the Google cache and the encoded text will display correctly.

As you wish to maintain the device in a usable state, it's recommended to keep the battery in as healthy state as possible. Refer to the Apples's webpage dedicated to Batteries here and follow the recommended storage guidelines:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/in/batteries/\nSpecifically:\nFrom, https://www.apple.com/in/batteries/maximizing-performance/\n\nAvoid extreme ambient temperatures\nYour device is designed to perform well in a wide range of ambient temperatures, with 16° to 22° C (62° to 72° F) as the ideal comfort zone.\n\nEven when storing, make sure to keep the device in the given temperature range.\n\nStore it half-charged when you store it long term\nIf you want to store your device long term, two key factors will affect the overall health of your battery: the environmental temperature and the percentage of charge on the battery when it’s powered down for storage. Therefore, we recommend the following:\n\n*\n\n*Do not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge it to around 50 per cent. If you store a device when its battery is fully discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\n\n\n*Power down the device to avoid additional battery use.\n\n\n*Place your device in a cool, moisture-free environment that’s less than 32° C (90° F).\n\n\n*If you plan to store your device for longer than six months, charge it to 50 per cent every six months.\nDepending on how long you store your device, it may be in a low-battery state when you remove it from long-term storage. After it’s removed from storage, it may require 20 minutes of charging with the original adapter before you can use it.\n\nThe website also recommends to update your device to the latest available version of iOS to benefit from software optimizations. However, if you wish to preserve the factory installed version of iOS, refrain from upgrading the iOS (which can be ensured by not letting the device connect to data network).\n\nFor my own devices that I have stored for long term, I generally power them on once every couple months and make sure to keep the battery charge at recommended 50%.\nIt would be a good idea to fully charge, then discharge, then charge the battery to 50% to store it again for long term. This would ensure that the electrons get a chance to move.\n", "Q: Window always stay on top on Catalina?

I have an external 1TB USB drive (mechanical, not flash) dedicated as a Time Machine backup. It is completely handled by MacOS/Time Machine.\nIs it safe to unplug it at any time, including while a backup is running? I am aware how this stuff works generally (missing cached data, corrupting internal file systems data structures, journaling etc.), but would like to know if Time Machine is - together with journaling - robust in this regard for devices dedicated to it.\nIt would be acceptable to lose the currently running backup; I just want to avoid corrupting the filesystem or the Time Machine state on it so much that I have to reformat.\nEDIT: Someone mentioned the \"Golden Rule\" of always ejecting. This question specifically asks whether this Golden Rule is relevant to Time Machine-managed devices, or whether Apple has gone out of its way to make a Time-machine-managed device immune to the usual problems of unplugging during use.\n\nA: Golden Rule - eject a drive before disconnecting it.\nEven if it doesn't appear to be busy.\n999 times out of a thousand, you'd get away with it - it's just that one last time that will completely wreck your file system.\n", "Q: Create a terminal command to open another user profile in chrome How can I create a terminal command to open another user's profile in Chrome?\nIt takes me a long time to switch between them because I have a lot of users in Chrome.\n\nA: Testing with Google Chrome (85.0.4183.102), the following command in Terminal works for me:\nopen -na 'Google Chrome' --args --profile-directory=\"$PROFILE\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Where $PROFILE is the name of the profile you want to open, e.g. \"Default\", \"Profile 1\", \"Profile 2\", etc.\n\n*Note: The $PROFILE is the name of each folder for each user in: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/\n\n*In Google Chrome if you open a tab to chrome://version/ and look at Profile Path:, you'll see which profile folder belongs to the user who's profile you are current logged in as.\n\n\nIf you want to get details of each profile, you can use the third-party utility jq to parse the ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Local State file in Terminal, e.g.:\njq .profile ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome/Local\\ State\n\nYou can then look at the output for e.g. \"Default\", \"Profile 1\", \"Profile 2\", etc. and under each profile you'll see info for e.g. \"gaia_given_name\":, \"gaia_name\":, \"name\": or \"user_name\": to ascertain which profile belongs to whom.\nI downloaded jq from https://stedolan.github.io/jq/ and it was saved a jq-osx-amd64 in my Downloads folder. I renamed it to jq, made it executable with chmod +x jq and moved it to /usr/local/bin/ so it would be available in my PATH.\n", "Q: mdls does not work on mounted sparse bundles mdls does not return anything when I run it on a mounted (originally encrypted) sparse bundle:\n❯ ll ./test\n.rw-r--r--@ 0 evar 14 Sep 18:34 ./test\n\n❯ mdls ./test                                                                                                               \n./test: could not find ./test.\n\nTrying mdutil to turn on the indexing:\n❯ sudo mdutil -d /Volumes/sth                                                                                               \n/System/Volumes/Data/Volumes/sth:\nError: unable to perform operation.

I am on iOS 14.0.1\nP.P.S.  I tried various things - the only thing that worked reliably was turning off Bluetooth on my mac.\n\nA: First off, it's not a \"speaker list,\" it's list of devices that can take or make phone calls.  If you paired a Bluetooth headset it would show up there as will your car's Bluetooth connection (if you have one and it's paired).  This is probably what's causing your confusion when trying to disable it.\nSo, to do so, you have to turn off WiFi calling on your \"other\" devices\nSettings → Phone → Calls on Other Devices.  There will be a section called Allow Calls On.  Toggle off the device you don't want to allow access, in this case \"Jeffs Mac.\"  Once you do that, it will no longer show up as a device to send the call to.\nBelow are screen grabs from my iPhone that's configured to use my Mac as an audio device for phone calls.  Upon disabling it in Calls on Other Devices it's removed as an audio option on the call screen.\n \n\nA: \nDoh!

But that disk works ok in other pcs or external cage. How can I be sure what is the problem? Really is the disk? Is the sata cable? Is the board?\nLong story with what I've tried so far\nI have a macbook 2012 that was working with an SSD (WD green 240GB). It stops working suddenly. I then power on again the computer and there was an icon with a question mark.\nThen I booted in recovery mode but the system did not recognize the disk.\nI've replaced the SSD with an spare HDD and I was able to install the OS to the HDD as a temporary solution because I thought the disk failed. I plugged the SSD in another pc (iMac) and I was able to access all my files. fsck reported something like fsroot tree issue so I erased the disk.\nI then removed the HDD from the macbook and was ready to install again my SSD. Again, disk was not recognized. I then tried again reading the SSD in another pc and it shows up.\nI tried using an external case to install the OS but the installer does not allow me because of firmware or something like that. But at least the disk was recognized.\nAt this point I was not sure if it was the disk or if it was a cable issue. So I plug in another SSD and it was recognized correctly.\nI take then my SSD WD green and clean its pins with an spry electronic cleaner. The macbook then recognized the disk. Then tried to erase the disk in order to make a fresh install of the OS but the erase tool hangs when saying something like \"wating partitions to be ready\". I waited long time and nothing happened.\nI turn off the computer then and took again the disk to another pc. I ran SMART, short and long self tests on the disk and seems ok to me. Then I erase it with full of zeroes using dd tool on a freebsd machine.\nI attached again the disk to the macbook I was able to at least start the OS installation... just that it never finished. It hangs with an apple and a full bar below the logo.\nTurned off the mac again after waiting long long time and the disk was not recognized again... but guess what, if I attach the disk to another pc it shows up.\nAgain I tried with HDD and other SSD and macbook is ok recognizing them.\nAt the end I'm unsure about what the problem is... I cannot say is the SSD disk because it works on other machines. I cannot say is the SATA cable as different disks works ok attached to it.\nI can use/buy another SSD disk on that mac but I'm not sure if the issue will appear again... that is, if replacing the disk will really fix the issue :)\nAny hints? something I'm missing to try?\nThis is the SMART info of the disk: https://bsd.to/1KqT\n\nA: It's the cable. The internal disk flex cable connecting the disk to the motherboard. Trust me, I have seen these symptoms dozens of times with the MacBook Pro 13\" 2012, and it can really give extrmemly weird problems, of the sort you describe.\nYou need a new cable, the only problem is knowing which one. The 2012 MBPs use one of 3(!) different identical looking disk flex cables with different model numbers. First check which one you have, lift the connector from the motherboard and look on the underside of the cable on the part. The model number will probably be either 821-1480 or 821-2049. If it is the former it might need to be replaced either by the same, or the 821-2049. If the latter, it will need a replacement with the same model, 821-2049.\nIf you only get one new cable to try, I would bet on the 821-2049. Regardless, it's that cable, there's your problem right there.\n", "Q: Synology Time Machine Out of Space -- Why won't it delete old backups I am using a DS620slim for Time Machine backups. My Mac runs 10.15.6 and it completed backups a day ago without issue.\nI've created a shared folder with a specific user and a disk space quota to prevent time machine from consuming all my NAS space.\nI've now reached the point where the shared folder is near at its quota limit, however, TM does not appear to be deleting old backups. Instead, attempting to backup gives me this error:\n\nWhy aren't old backups getting deleted automatically?\nThis is the process used to limit space is the shared folder quota:\n\n\nA: For me it worked after I disabled the Recycle bin on the Shared Folder. When Time Machine tried to delete old backups it moved them to the Recycle bin instead which causes the Shared Folder to never decrease in size.\n\nA: I would open a support ticket with synology. You have excellent details and perhaps they have a patch or better setup procedure for your specific version of macOS and storage software.\n\n*\n\n*specifically ask them if you could be using a sparse bundle for storage and if they can automate compacting of that bundle\n\nAs for your existing backup date - since space is tight, I would manually clean up some old backups using command line tools. Check for sparsebundle files which optimize network traffic and also need to be compacted periodically if space gets tight.\n\n*\n\n*How can I manually delete old backups to free space for Time Machine?\nAs you delete a few old backups, you can watch how much space is cleared and then attempt a backup after each cleanup.\nLastly, if you think you have enough space and don’t agree with the estimate for needed space, exclude some large folders and/or system files temporarily from backup and attempt a more limited backup. Eventually if you exclude enough “space” you can often get a small backup to run. After successful backups, the automatic pruning is more vigorous in my experience. After a few hours of clean runs, reverse the exclusions and see if your intended coverage now works with your storage.\nDon’t overlook using an inexpensive direct attached disk as well to get one clean backup to a new destination that will let you know the Mac data is good and the problem is only with the synology side or existing data.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250\n", "Q: Prevent \"upgrades\" (like Catalina) from appearing in software update window I don't want to see Catalina here anymore. I'm tired of Apple's update aggression:\n\nWhat can I do (short of nuking the App Store) to prevent OS \"upgrades\" from being listed in the Software Window (for ALL users)?\nI tried this method but is no longer an effective solution. I get the message below, and Catalina remains.\nIgnoring software updates is deprecated. The ability to ignore individual updates will be removed in a future release of macOS.\nWell, it seems the ability has already been removed.\n\nA: As of Sep 2020, the steps to do this on High Sierra or Mojave are:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have Security Update 2020-005 installed\n\n*Enrol your device in Mobile Device Management. For those that have a workplace or school that already use MDM, this is simple - just follow their instructions for 'bring your own device' setup. For those that don't, you can setup your own MDM by signing up for a JAMF Now account - see my guide at bottom.\n\n*Double check your device is now managed, by executing profiles status -type enrollment in a terminal and checking that at least one of Enrolled via DEP or MDM enrolment is Yes.\n\n*Run sudo softwareupdate --ignore \"macOS Catalina\" in a terminal to ignore the Catalina update. If it worked, you should see Ignored updates:( \"macOS Catalina\" )\n\n*Run defaults write com.apple.systempreferences AttentionPrefBundleIDs 0;killall Dock in a terminal to turn off the red notifications tag for the Software Updates dock icon and refresh the dock.\n\nChanges to software update --ignore ability\nAs you mentioned, the fix for this used to be the command:\nsudo softwareupdate --ignore \"macOS Catalina\"\n\nHowever, this command was deprecated in May 2020 with security update 2020-003. Mr Macintosh did a great job of documenting this at the time. As of that update, softwareupdate --ignore returns the below message, without actually adding anything to the ignore list.\nIgnoring software updates is deprecated.\nThe ability to ignore individual updates will be removed in a future release of macOS.\n\nApple must have got a lot of heat for this, as they backflipped, a bit: with security updates 2020-004 & 2020-005 they re-enabled ignoring updates, but only for managed devices, ie those managed with Apple Business/School Manager or user-approved MDM. (2020-004 was meant to re-enable it for both but actually it was still broken for UAMDM. 2020-005 finally fixed this)\nSo if you've installed those updates, provided your device is enrolled in any UA MDM, running the above ignore command will work. Signing into your work email using Mail might be enough to achieve this, depending on the setup.\nSetting up your own MDM to enrol in\nIf you don't have a work or school management provider to use, you can always set up you own using one of the many free trials offered by MDM providers. This is going to somewhat extreme ends to remove the upgrade prompt, but it only took me about 15 mins to do, so may be worth it if it annoys you sufficiently.\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*From https://www.jamf.com/solutions/industries/business/, look for JAMF Now and click Create Free Account\n\n*Fill in the form, then check your email to finish activating the account and login\n\n*Follow the steps to create a new Push Certificate and upload it to your JAMF account\n\n*Setup Open Enrolment in your account, and share the enrolment link to the device you want to disable the Catalina update on\n\n*Click the link on that device, and enrol it in the UA MDM you've setup\n\nYou should now be enrolled. You can check by running profiles status -type enrollment in terminal - you should see a line saying MDM enrollment: Yes (User Approved). If you do, the sudo softwareupdate --ignore \"macOS Catalina\" command should now work!\n", "Q: In a Macbook, I'm ready to change the boot disk and replace the superdrive with an SSD.

I pull up the character viewer and use the search function for special characters using a five digit sequence, such as U+1d122, and it instantly displays the corresponding special music symbol as listed in the table Unicode Standard 13.0  This also works for a few others, such as U+1d121, another music symbol.  But the other values in that range block (1d100-1d1ff), even those within the same column, do not result in the musical symbol appearing. Instead it's just blank, like I've typed in some random characters.  The one I wanted was 1d10B, a musical symbol \"segno\".

What is the best way to connect a mid 2012 macbook pro to a new ultra wide external monitor?  I know most of the monitors suggest using USB C but that doesn't exist in my macbook pro so trying to figure out the best option (that doesn't require ordering a new laptop)\n\nA: I'm assuming you're asking about the UltraWide LG monitor range, since this is their registered mark.\nThe best way would be to use the Mini Display Port (also known as Thunderbolt) on your Mac and Display Port on your monitor (with the correct cable), but you will not be able to use more than 2560 by 1600 (In case you have 15\" 2012 MacBook Pro with retina display). Via HDMI, your MacBook is able to output only 1920 by 1080.\nSuch a compatible monitor should be LG 29WK600-W.\n\nA: When I first read this question, I assumed the OP was hoping for an answer from a user who actually had a 2012 MacBook Pro connected to a ultra wide monitor. Unfortunately, I do not. So, the best I can offer is an answer based on internet searching. (I assume the OP already did this before posted the question, but I may have come to a different conclusion.)\n\nActually, a similar question was asked over 6 years ago. Ironically, a bounty was offered for this question and no answer was accepted.\n\nBasically, you should be able to get a monitor with an ultra wide resolution of 2560x1080 (WFHD) to work with any 2012 MacBook Pro, but this probably will require modifying macOS. One such tool for making modifications is SwitchResX. This product requires System Integrity Protect (SIP) to be turned off in order for SwitchResX to modify macOS. Once modifications are complete, SIP can be turned back on. Below is an excerpt from the answer to the SwitchResX webpage FAQ: \"I can't get my wide screen monitor to show its native resolution on my Mac\".\n\nThis question is valid for getting wide screen resolutions on older Macs....\n\nYour Mac has limits in the resolutions it can send to the monitor and the monitor has limits in the resolutions it can show from the Mac. The monitor communicate with the Mac and sends it a list of predefined resolutions it wants to get.\nYour Mac does or doesn’t activate each of these resolutions depending on its own capabilities.\n\nFor example, the monitor will send 1920x1080 at 60Hz as well as 2560x1080 at 60Hz as its wanted resolutions.\nIf 2560x1080 at 60Hz doesn’t fit the Mac’s capabilities, then the Mac will only activate 1920x1080 at 60Hz.\n\nIn this case, there's no other predefined resolution claimed by the monitor that fits inside the Mac's limits....\nOne of the limitations of most Macs before 2014 when using a DisplayPort output is a resolution bandwidth of 165 MHz.\n\nWith SwitchResX, you could define new resolutions that fit inside the monitors and the Mac’s limits, but that are not natively claimed by the monitor....\n\nYou can define 2560x1080 at 50Hz for example, which is a resolution that fits in the standard limitation of 165 MHz for the bandwidth. Most of the times, a good monitor can handle this lower frequency.\nSwitchResX will help the Mac and the monitor into finding a resolution that matches their capabilities and is better than the only 1920x1080 resolution that you now have....\n\nThis will for example allow to define 2560x1080 in 50Hz, which will remain under the 165 MHz limit....\nIf there's no resolution that fits in both your Mac and your monitor's limits, these limits have no common space. In this last case, this cannot be corrected by software.\n\nAs for the best way to connect, this depends on the monitor. If purchasing a new monitor, apparently, a display port on the monitor probably would offer the most compatibility with the mini display port (thunderbolt port) on your Mac.\nThe problem with using a USB port is the speed of data transmission. You do not have a USB type C port, but you do have USB type A ports with speeds unto 5 Gbps. USB type A to type C adapter do exist, but the speeds would still be limited to 5 Gbps. With this in mind, using your mini display port (thunderbolt port) would be a better choice.\nThe 2012 MacBook Pro Retina models have a HDMI port. However, this port is limited to resolution of 1920x1200, which is not enough to support an ultra wide monitor.\n\nA: *\n\n*The best way to connect any Thunderbolt 2 Mac to a display is Thunderbolt since that gets you video and hub (USB / ethernet) functionality. This cable costs second most of the 4 options.\n\n*Second best is to connect to a Thunderbolt dock. This costs more, but not all modern displays support Thunderbolt in. This costs the most for the hardware, but you get a docking station that fits your exact needs and one cable connection. Convenient and capable.\n\n*Third best is HDMI if the display has that as an input - go direct. This is the least expensive option in terms of cabling.\n\n*Fourth best is an adapter - use the Thunderbolt port as it also drives adapters to DisplayPort and HDMI - the video quality is superb here, just less functionality. This can cost far less than a dock, second cheapest.\n\nOne note - Apple's Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter is bi-directional - you can connect newer thunderbolt 3 devices to older Thunderbolt 2 Macs and there's no real downside as the speed of 2 (and thunderbolt 1) is faster than any USB 3.1 network / display / hub can saturate alone. USB-C connector and Thunderbolt 3 adapters are physically the same - just as Thunderbolt 2 shares the same pin and hardware connector as Mini DisplayPort.\nSome great docks are made by Dell and HP (value and support) as well as Belkin, OWC and Elgato - those brand's 2 and 3 docks have been stellar values and top performers, great support for years.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-thunderbolt-dock/\n\n*https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter\nYou should have good success with any of these options in terms of driving all the pixels of your ultra wide display as fast as your Mac GPU can push the data. I've tested the first option between 2014 MacBook Pro and the LG 5K display - works great - full resolution, so any limiting on resolution is not the cables. My 2013 Mac Pro also routinely work with the newest displays and cables described above. No drivers are needed - all of this works out of the box.\nNone of the 4 options is visually worse than any of the others, so I called them all best - but ranked them to help you and others out budget and buy.\n\nA: A mid-2012 MacBook Pro has one Thunderbolt port aka Mini DisplayPort: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp649?locale=en_US\nI've never tried doing anything graphic intensive.\n\nA: I have both, working at the 2560x1080 default resolution.\nI use a MiniDP male splitter to HDMI, but I only use one of the two outputs, obviously. It was a random trial and test just because I had the adapter already.\nAlternatively, I think the native and most proper option I'd be using a miniDP to DVI Dual Link adapter, in order to increase the bandwidth, then a DVI Dual Link to HDMI.

Is there a way to do it in mac music?\nWhat I have tried so far. In the \"Music App\" I have:\n\n*\n\n*Disabled option to \"copy when adding to library\"\n\n*Disabled option to \"keep music organised\"\n\nThen I use \"Add folder to library\" and it kind of works. But it seems to stop, after a while and does not add all the music. It seems to run in alphabetical folder (Artist) order. First time stopped during \"A\". If I do \"Add folder to library\" again it adds more music, I have repeated a few times and got to \"D\".\n\n*\n\n*Is there some reason the \"Add folder to library\" is not working properly? Does it have limits? Or does it give up if in background for too long or if laptop goes to sleep?\n\nBut even if add does work, its will not automatically monitor for changes like foobar does right?\nI also tried changing the setting of where the music app keeps media to the USB stick, but that didn't work either, nothing shows up.\n\nA: As far as I know there is no option to \"watch\" a folder. You manually add all music in a folder regularly, Music will not duplicate what it already had imported.\nThe function should work properly, it will just take very long for large libraries as the music app is fairly slow when importing.\n", "Q: How can I reinstall macOS without a working display? I had bought a used MacBook Pro 2013 on which Ubuntu was installed instead of macOS. Its display is broken, so I have been using an external monitor. However, when I tried to follow the official guide to reinstall macOS, nothing was displayed on the external monitor.\nIs there a way to recover my MacBook Pro to macOS without paying for a new display?\n\nA: Normally, the boot process on a computer is displayed on all connected displays. This unfortunately doesn't seem to necessary hold on all modern Apple laptops.\nThere's a workaround you could try though:\n\n*\n\n*Connect an external display, keyboard, and mouse (ideally, ensure beforehand that this setup is working),\n\n*shut down the system (if it's not turned off already),\n\n*open the broken display, then\n\n*start it up. The Mac will now start booting and of course try to display all information on the broken display.\n\n*If you now close the lid during boot, the system will force the video signal to the (functioning) external display. And having an external keyboard (and mouse), you should be able to use your computer!\n\n\nAlternatively:\nIn case you have another Mac at your disposal, you could try and hook them up together and start the one with the broken display in \"targetdisk mode\". (Look up this keyword if the solution above doesn't work and you need more information as to how to hook two Macs up with one another and/or how to start a Mac in target disk mode.)\n", "Q: Boot Camp Issue with Mac Pro 3,1 and ATI Radeon RX580 graphics card I have a Mac Pro 3,1 with an ATI Radeon RX580 8GB graphics card, a dosDude Catalina (10.15.6) install on an internal SSD and and a Windows 10 Pro (latest Version and updates) install on an internal HD.\nBoth macOS and the Windows work fine along with all parts of the Mac. As I a have the Radeon card I do not have a boot screen until either Catalina has mostly started up or Windows has started to boot, so I cannot change the booting by holding down the Option key.\nI previously ran El Capitan instead of Catalina, and with that I had installed in Windows the Boot Camp 4 drivers, which allowed me to select macOS from the Boot Camp Assistant and reboot from Windows into El Capitan. From El Capitan I could select the Windows drive in the start up disc control panel and reboot into Windows.\nHowever, since upgrading to Catalina, I can still select the Windows drive in the start up disc control panel and reboot into Windows. However if I select macOS from the Boot Camp Assistant and reboot the Mac, it always reboots into Windows.\nMy current work around is to shut down, remove the Windows drive, reboot in to Catalina, select Catalina in the Startup Disk control panel, reboot into Catalina, shut down, re-install the windows drive, start up and it starts up into Catalina again with the Windows disk mounted. I can then just select the Windows drive in the start up disc control panel and reboot into Windows when I need to.\nFrom what I have read it's an issue with boot camp not liking the APFS file system Catalina uses. I have also read that a newer version of Boot Camp would fix the issue. I have upgraded Boot Camp to version 6, but this cause other issues in Windows and in the end I had to format the windows drive and re-install it from scratch along with the Boot Camp 4 drivers.\nCan anybody tell me how I can get this issue sorted out so I can just switch using Boot Camp?\nMany thanks\nDuncan\n\nA: Most users have solved this problem by running Apple Software Update to get a newer version of Boot Camp. For users where this update is unavailable or unusable, there is a solution involving using the rEFInd Boot Manager. When properly installed and configured, rEFInd can allow Boot Camp to indirectly boot from Windows to a macOS residing in a APFS container.\nThe idea is simple enough: From Windows, you use Boot Camp to choose rEFInd. When the Mac boots rEFInd, the Mac will be instruct by rEFInd to silently boot Catalina.\nFor this to work, you will need use the following steps to install and configure rEFInd.\n\n*\n\n*Create a small Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partition.\n\n*Download rEFInd. This is a free product.\n\n*Install rEFInd to the small Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partition. Basically, use the --ownhfs option when invoking refind-install.\n\n*Edit the refind.conf file to silently boot Catalina.\n\nYou should be able to install rEFInd without disabling SIP.\n", "Q: Export Apple Notes I want to export (or transfer) all notes from the Apple Notes app to a note taking app on a different platform. So I need to bulk copy or move all the notes I have in Apple Notes to Linux. Is there any way to do this?\nFrom what I've tried, the Notes app on the MacBook can only export a single note as an unmodifiable PDF, by using the export as PDF button. I want to be able to export all notes in the Notes app in one go as modifiable text files, and for the export operation to preserve all images and links in each note.\n\nA: The Apple Notes program does not offer such a feature, nor does Apple offer other export tools that would handle this.\nIn regards to exporting as a simple text file - you cannot actually do that while preserving images and other features in the notes. The PDF export is good for \"static usage\" (i.e. if you're not going to edit the notes afterwards).\nIf you look at third party solutions, I would look at the following:\nYour best bet is probably third party exports such as the \"Apple Cloud Notes Parser\" project:\nhttps://github.com/threeplanetssoftware/apple_cloud_notes_parser\nAlternatively you can run a third party Apple Notes client on Linux and keep using Apple's service:\nhttps://github.com/xfanatical/linux-client-for-icloud-notes\nThe third option is IMAP: The Notes program supports IMAP accounts. You can use a third party mail service and add that as an account and then copy your notes to that service within Apple Notes. Then you can copy the actual IMAP emails that these notes are stored within on Linux. It is not in a standard format that is readily usable by other notes programs unfortunately.\n\nA: I exported all my Notes by using a modification of the script on this page. The result was an html file for each note, which has the advantage of preserving much text formatting and images and can be opened in Word.\nThe results were not perfect (see below), but it was easy to do. No need to know how to write scripts - just follow the procedure below if you want to try it:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Script Editor (a program that comes with the Mac OS located in the Utilities folder; ie, Go>Utilities)\n\n\n*Change the dropdown menu at the upper left to JavaScript (see screenshot below)\n\n\n*Use File>New and then paste the following code into the Window\n[note to editor: I can't get the code below to format properly]\n// set things up\nvar app = Application.currentApplication();\napp.includeStandardAdditions = true;\nvar notesApp = Application('Notes');\nnotesApp.includeStandardAdditions = true;\n// choose which notes\nvar notes = notesApp.notes;\nvar whichNotes = app.chooseFromList(notes.name(), { withPrompt: \"Which Notes?\", multipleSelectionsAllowed: true });\nif (whichNotes) {\n// choose save location\nvar saveWhere = app.chooseFolder().toString();\n\nif (saveWhere) {\n\n    // loop through all notes\n    for(var i=0; i<notes.length; i++) {\n    \n        // is this note one to be exported?\n        if (whichNotes.indexOf(notes[i].name()) > -1) {\n        \n            // save file as html\n        var efilename = notes[i].name().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/gi, '_').substring(0, 30);\n        var filename = saveWhere+\"/\"+efilename+\".html\";\n            var file = app.openForAccess(Path(filename), { writePermission: true });\n            app.setEof(file, { to: 0 });\n            app.write(notes[i].body(), {to: file});\n            app.closeAccess(file);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n}\nIt should be noted that this script differs from the one at the top of the page linked according to the last comment on that page by Masoud. Specifically, the lines beginning var efilename and var filename.\n\n\n*run the script (click the arrow in the upper right)\n\n\n*select all notes in the \"Which notes?\" dialog that appears (see screenshot below)\n\n\n*in the final dialog select a folder to save the notes\nThe script ran about 3 minutes for my 260 notes.

I've been using a different Apple ID on my MacBook Pro than my usual ID (for work reasons), but decided to move everything to the same Apple ID. I logged out and...my documents and desktop were gone. I know some of them synced to iCloud, so I can get them off the website, but I had more than 5GB in there,  so many files didn't sync, and I didn't care to upgrade because I just wanted to keep it local. Did it delete my files, or are they tucked away somewhere where I can retrieve them from?\n\nA: They are synced to the other Apple ID. All information in the iCloud is stored there and logging out of an Apple ID will take all the information away with it.\nTo retrieve them, I suggest logging back with the ID and copying them to the local machine. Log out, and log into your new Apple ID.\nThere’s no other way around it. Apple is very strict about information stored in the iCloud\n\nA: I found my files in my user directory, in a directory named \"iCloud Drive (Archive)\", as well as another backup from another Apple ID I'd tried in a directory named \"iCloud Drive (Archive) - 1\".

Background\nI use a private network router which is a separate host to my desktop. This private (\"corporate\") network comes and goes (mostly under my control), and I want to make sure that when it is available my desktop will use the corporate network DNS, but stop using that DNS when the corporate network is not available.\nFor the sake of concrete examples to work with, my local network uses 172.16.1.0/24 with a DNS server at 172.16.1.1, while the corporate network uses 10.10.0.0/16 with a DNS server at 10.10.1.1.\nThe private network router uses dnsmasq which I've configured something like this:\n# /etc/dnsmasq.d/default.dnsmasq\nserver=172.16.1.1\nserver=/mycompany.com/it.mycompany.com/mycompany.org/10.10.1.1\n\nWhere 172.16.1.1 is my local DNS (on my internet router) and 10.10.1.1 is the corporate DNS which handles DNS for private networks such as our intranet. Thus if I look up \"apple.stackexchange.com\" it will be resolved by 172.16.1.1 while \"confluence.mycompany.com\" will be resolved by 10.10.1.1.\nSo I've written a script which basically takes a bunch of CIDRs and configures route for them, then switches to the private network DNS. Here's a sanitised version of the script for completeness:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Alters routing and DNS to use private network routes and DNS for\n# private network destinations\n\nnetworks=( \"10.10.0.0/16\" \"192.168.20.0/24\"  )\ngateway=172.16.1.10\n\nif [ \"$1\" = \"up\" -o \"$1\" = \"on\" -o \"$1\" = \"start\" ] ; then\n    echo \"Setting up private configuration\"\n    for net in ${networks[@]}; do\n        /sbin/route add -net $net -gateway $gateway\n    done\n    /usr/sbin/networksetup -setdnsservers 'Ethernet' $gatewayip\nelif [ \"$1\" = \"down\" -o \"$1\" = \"off\" -o \"$1\" = \"stop\" ] ; then\n    echo \"Shutting down private configuration\"\n    /usr/sbin/networksetup -setdnsservers 'Ethernet' 'Empty'\n    for net in ${networks[@]}; do\n        /sbin/route delete -net $net -gateway $gateway\n    done\nelse\n    echo \"Usage: $0 (start|stop)\"\nfi\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\nThis leads to a slightly bizarre situation where I'm passing all DNS requests through the private router, when the private router is just going to bounce most DNS requests right back to the Internet router. It works, but I don't think it's particularly tidy or robust.\nThe Question\nIs there any way to configure macOS DNS similarly to my dnsmasq configuration, where I simply tell my Mac to keep using 172.16.1.1 for DNS except when the domain is mycompany.com or mycompany.org, in which case it it should use 10.10.1.1?\n\nA: macOS uses a system configuration database to maintain things like which DNS servers to use, and what domains those serves are used for. This database is exposed to the user through the interactive scutil program.\nTo update DNS servers and search domains, the simplest invocation of this tool would happen like this:\n[root@host]$ scutil\n> d.init\n> d.add ServerAddresses * 172.16.1.10\n> d.set State:/Network/Service/UniqueKey/DNS\n> quit\n\nTo perform this configuration change, I created two expect scripts, one to load the configuration and the other to unload the configuration.\nHere's the script to load the DNS configuration (note the \"Corporate-VPN\" part of the key which is the unique identifier for this configuration element):\n#!/opt/local/bin/expect -f\nset timeout -1\nspawn /usr/sbin/scutil\nmatch_max 100000\nexpect \"> \"\nsend -- \"d.init\\r\"\nexpect \"> \"\nsend -- \"d.add ServerAddresses * $env(VPNHOST)\\r\"\nexpect \"> \"\nsend -- \"d.add SupplementalMatchDomains * intranet.company.com services.company.com\\r\"\nexpect \"> \"\nsend -- \"set State:/Network/Service/Corporate-VPN/DNS\\r\"\nexpect \"> \"\nsend -- \"quit\\r\"\nexpect eof\n\nAnd then the script to unload the configuration:\n#!/opt/local/bin/expect -f\nset timeout -1\nspawn /usr/sbin/scutil\nmatch_max 100000\nexpect \"> \"\nsend -- \"remove State:/Network/Service/Corporate-VPN/DNS\\r\"\nexpect \"> \"\nsend -- \"quit\\r\"\nexpect eof\n\nThere is still plenty of tidy-up to do here (notably handling errors).\nThe previous method I wrote using the Resolvers system remains below. It still works but it's not the recommended method.\n\nAs per Gordon's comment, using the resolver system provided a solution:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Alters routing and DNS to use private network routes and DNS for\n# private network destinations\n\nnetworks=( \"10.10.0.0/16\" \"192.168.20.0/24\"  )\nwork_domains=( \"intranet.company.com\" \"services.company.com\" \"customer.org\" )\ngateway=172.16.1.10\n\nif [ \"$1\" = \"up\" -o \"$1\" = \"on\" -o \"$1\" = \"start\" ] ; then\n    echo \"Setting up private configuration\"\n    for net in ${networks[@]}; do\n        /sbin/route add -net $net -gateway $gateway\n    done\n    for netname in ${work_domains[@]}; do\n        echo \"nameserver $gateway\" >> /etc/resolver/$netname\n    done\nelif [ \"$1\" = \"down\" -o \"$1\" = \"off\" -o \"$1\" = \"stop\" ] ; then\n    echo \"Shutting down private configuration\"\n    for netname in ${work_domains[@]}; do\n        rm /etc/resolver/$netname\n    done\n    for net in ${networks[@]}; do\n        /sbin/route delete -net $net -gateway $gateway\n    done\nelse\n    echo \"Usage: $0 (start|stop)\"\nfi\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\n", "Q: Do Apple WiFi drivers have a problem with Asus Routers? My two apple systems claim that my ASUS AC-88U is broadcasting country code '-'.\nAsus claims  that they will broadcast NA (for North America).

If I have both the Mojave and Mountain Lion drives loaded into the drive bays, the computer will always choose to boot Mountain Lion, and the only way I can get Mojave to boot is to physically pull out the Mountain Lion drive.  I am just trying to come up with a way to be able to boot to Mojave from Mountain Lion since it cannot see the volume (due to it being APFS)...  Is there anything I can do?  The last thing I want to have to do is solder wires to the mother board and connect them to a switch so I can disable a drive--- I would much rather find a way to do this with software.\n\nA: Create a small JHFS+ formatted partition. Install the rEFInd Boot Manager to this partition. Configure rEFInd to silently boot Mojave. If configured properly, rEFInd will appear in the Startup Disk pane of System Preferences of Mountain Lion. You then can select rEFInd from Mountain Lion. When rEFInd boots, the software will silently instruct the firmware to boot Mojave.\nA simpler alternative may be to rename the System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi  file in the Mountain Lion startup volume.

While reading the iOS 14 guide by Apple here, on page 78, In the Quit and reopen an app section\n\nWhat does the highlighted statement mean?\n\n*\n\n*Is it that on iOS, the apps don’t close(terminate processes is what I mean here) at all and are still active and the app switcher is just for the ease of multitasking.\n\n*Is it that the services(eg. in the mail app, the service to fetch mails and send notifications) are still on, but the app is terminated.\n\n\nA: It is actually neither of the two. It is a third variant, namely that ordinary apps cannot run in the background. So when you're looking at some app, other apps in the background aren't consuming CPU time (which translates into battery power) - so quitting the app won't make it consume less.\nIn regarding to receiving notifications, which you mentioned, they will be received no matter if the app is quit or not. In some cases more battery power will actually be used here if you quit the app instead of leaving it be.\nIn general you should not be quitting apps unless you're experiencing some kind of bug or problem with the app where it doesn't work.\n\nA: iOS has pretty tight controls on when an app can run. Mostly this means that if the app is not in the foreground, it cannot run, though there are exceptions. When you swipe away from an app, the app's state is saved in memory, so the next time you open it it's faster and more efficient to start up. The increase in memory usage this causes isn't a problem either -- if the system starts to run low on memory, one of the first ways it will increase memory is by evicting backgrounded apps.\n", "Q: How do I compress a file into .xip format? I wanted to compress the Xcode.app I downloaded from the app store into .xip format. Is it the same as compressing it to .zip and renaming?\n\nA: No, .xip files have nothing to do with .zip files - it's not the same format at all. .xip files are really a type of xar archive.\nIf you want to compress your own .xip file, you can do that with the xip command in macOS:\nxip file1 file2 file3 archive.xip\n\nHowever you cannot compress Xcode.app to a .xip file and send that to others and expect them to be able to just unpack it by double-clicking. The file will be verified to see if the .xip is signed by Apple - if it is not, it will not be automatically unpacked.\n", "Q: On iPadOS 14, what does this box on the today view do? 2019 iPad, running the new release of iPadOS 14.

How can I include in a (zsh) shell script a command that will minimize one particular window among several windows open in a specified app?\nI already know how to include a command that opens an app with one or more documents open in it, e.g.:\nopen -a textedit.app .profile .zshrc\n\nWhat command can I use from Terminal to minimize a specified one of those just-opened windows?\nI presume that something involving osascript is involved, such as in Is there a way to minimize open windows from the command line in OS X Lion?. But the method given there in the Edit by the original poster: (i) minimizes all the windows; and (ii) does use osascript which, as I recall, is not so simple to call from within a shell script.\n\nA: You referenced this page, which is only one example but a decent starting point. (You might also try more general search terms, such as “AppleScript window management”.)\n\n*\n\n*In most Applications, each window has an ‘index’ property that one can use to determine, for example, which is frontmost or which was created first. Depending on the complexity of the AppleScript dictionary for that particular application, it should often be possible to act on windows based on other properties, such as title.\n\n\n*To minimize multiple (or all) windows, one could run a loop that queries the ‘id’ or ‘index’ and ‘visible’ status of every window, and then act on them as desired. (I have done this in the past with web browsers to iterate through every window and tab for the purposes of exporting and logging.)\n\n\n*As far as running ‘osascript’, invoking it from a shell script file will let you call it using whatever shell (e.g. sh, bash, maybe even osascript itself) that makes quoting the easiest (or whatever shell the example you are copying was written for), even if you are using Zsh as your interactive (user) shell.\nRegardless, I strongly recommend getting your AppleScript working first in AppleScript Editor before attempting to run it from a terminal shell.\n\nA: \nHow can I include in a (zsh) shell script a command that will minimize one particular window among several windows open in a specified app?\n\nUse osascript to execute the following example command:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"TextEdit\" to set miniaturized of every window whose name is \"Untitled\" to true'\n\nObviously, change the name of the application and the name of the window as needed.\n", "Q: How to stop mac from moving windows from external display to laptop when opening laptop lid I have an external monitor connected to my MBP via HDMI.

I want all windows to stay on the external monitor until I physically move them to the laptop, and once I close the lid they should stay on the external monitor even if I re-open the lid.\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different. I think your experimentation has you on the right track. If you drag a window to the external monitor before closing the lid on your laptop, it should stay on the external monitor after opening the lid again. You may also want to check which monitor you have as primary - that's where your desktop icons will first appear. In System Preferences, go to Displays and then click on the Arrangement tab. The display with the white bar on top is primary. You can drag that bar to the other display to make it primary.\n", "Q: Zoomed out on ipad how to set normal view My ipad under ios14 has got to a stage where I have zoomed in.\nHow do,I reset the screen to.normal\nThe thumb and finger pinch seems to do nothing other pinches take me to.the tsk screen showing all safari tabs or all apps\n\nA: The accessibility zoom feature can be turned on and off with a double three-finger tap.\nTo control the zoom level, double three-finger tap and hold the second tap, then move your fingers up and down the screen to zoom in and out respectively.

Linux has binfmt_misc which allows arbitrary executable file formats to be recognized and passed to certain user space applications. Does macOS have a similar feature?\n\nA: No, macOS does not come with a similar feature.\nIf you're interested in adding it yourself, you can could take a look at this project:\nhttps://github.com/georghe-crihan/imgact_linux\nIt is a kernel extension that extends the kernel's exec_shell_imgact() function to recognize other file types (namely Linux ELF binaries) and pass them to a user space application to be executed.

Safari, working in text boxes such as on StackExchange.\nHappens all the time where I miss a space bar and wind up with 2 words glued together. I don’t use Simple English, so  iOS auto-suggest usually fails to see it as 2 words.\nSomehow I dodge the bullet of AutoCorrect changing it.\nBut now, I need to place the cursor in the middle of the mystery word, so I can add a space bar.  IOS can’t relate. It wants me to either change it to a different word altogether, or stubbornly selects the whole word.\nI can drag the handles to the middle to where it selects 1-3 characters, sacrifice those, and retype them.  That sucks.\nI want to know the right way to place the cursor mid-word.\n\nA: You can use Trackpad mode.\nLong-press the Space bar, than slide your finger on the keyboard to position the cursor.\n\n\nA: The only way I manage this is to tap away from the word and then move the cursor by dragging it with my finger as close as I can get.\nLike you though, I often sacrifice at least one character and on my iPad Pro often two or three AND have an issue with the shift key randomly selecting itself!\n\nA: Native touch gestures work best in native apps. Especially the touch and hold the space bar to change the cursor to text selection tool.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open pages or notes and do some typing and word selection.\n\n*Then come back here in the web browser and see that JavaScript and\nclient/server delays and functions like saving drafts alters responsiveness and fluidity.\n\nFor me, the right answer is to write in a native app and paste here. As blazing fast iOS is, text fields in web pages can get laggy and clunky if you are adept at iOS input or use multitouch gestures effectively. Even well designed and optimized sites suffer from this. Yes, Safari is itself native, but the web takes and gives in equal measure with code added to what appears to be a simple text box.  Even when you are close to the web server (2 to 12 ms latency), this lag is easily tested and reproduced. On slow internet with dropped packets, long delays to save a draft, even code running local in the browser and asynchronous saves can’t help ruining some text input experiences in web browsers.\nAnd poorly designed web pages can be downright frustratingly unworkable. Especially if they are user hostile logging each key press or just trying to scrape every detail, performance and privacy be damned. (e.g. the design isn’t to make you effective or happy but to serve other interests.)\n", "Q: Connect 3 monitors to Macbook Pro (2018) using one cable?

After updating from Safari 13 to Safari 14 (on macOS 10.15.6),\nI have noticed that all of my text-filtering Automator workflows\nno longer work correctly when invoked from the updated Safari.\nFor an example of such a workflow, see the screenshot below.\nIt shows a simple workflow that takes the current text selection,\npipes it through the fmt command, and replaces the original\nselection with that command’s output:\n\nI have a few workflows of this construction, i.e., consisting of\na single Run Shell Script action running a command that takes\nthe text selection on its stdin and outputs the text to replace\nthe selection with on its stdout.

The new commands you listed are intended to do precisely what you seek.\nI’ll update if I test this, but I would assume several things:\n\n*\n\n*It likely won’t matter if afp or smb shares are used if you try to move content via file sharing. SMB slightly preferred as it’s the new standard.\n\n*I would disable caching services before attempting any utility move.\n\n*I would move the cache to an external drive and then eject / move / absorb it to the new machine. (I almost always store cache on an external drive anyhow)\n\n*We put one cache server on every network segment, three or more on big network segments. With 100 or so, we do as little configuration as possible - no peering or parents have been needed yet.\n\nWith two or three caches - they rebalance each other without even needing to set up parent or peering configurations, but if you have massive clients to serve, you can make very sophisticated hierarchies with parent specific hash settings to maximize cache space or minimize lossage and internet when one node should fail.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-multiple-content-caches-on-mac-mchle150fb54/mac\n", "Q: Clear queue in Apple Music on iOS 14 Now that iOS 14 has added the feature to remember the song and not clear the queue(play next) when the app is closed, how are we supposed to clear the queue?\nPreviously, when we used to close the app, the queue used to get cleared. Also there is no option to clear queue in the three dot menu.\n\nUpdate\nUsing iOS 15.2, and the app now clears the queue everytime you close the app.\nUpdate\nUsing iOS 15.3 or 15.4, and the app doesn’t clear the queue everytime you close the app.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this was available before iOS 14, but now at least Apple Music provides a Shortcuts action that clears the up next queue. So you can easily create a shortcut to make clearing more convenient.\n\n*\n\n*Go into the Shortcuts App and tap + to add a new shortcut.\n\n*Search for \"Music\" and select the Music app icon to see a list of the actions it provides.\n\n*Select the \"Clear Up Next\" action to add it to the new shortcut.\n\n*As desired, use the short-cut properties via \"...\" to set the shortcut name, show it in the share sheet, create a home screen icon, or even show it on your watch.\n\nThis solution is not as nice as a dedicated button in Apple Music would be, but it's much more convenient than the other options.\n\nA: This top portion is something like a rant so you can skip to the next bolded text...\nSo to kinda summarize my thoughts in the comments on the native music app... If you clear the queue by closing the app, it's probably not a feature, but rather default software behavior and therefore probably just something they neglected until now. If a dev doesn't write a feature where the application remembers where you left off, why would it. So they didn't exactly remove a feature, they added a feature, that removed what I would call an exploit for the lack of a better word. Not saying OP claimed it was a feature, just saying they probably never thought anyone would use the music app that way and they didn't see it as replacing one feature with another one, so I wouldn't expect them adding a \"clear queue\" button anytime soon.\nI've always been a big fan of 3rd party apps in general, but talking about music apps specifically, I also had never even considered that the native app could be used that way because 3rd party apps had faaaaar superior queue systems long before Apple added it to the native music player. Pretty much from the beginning 3rd party apps have been innovating and Apple has been slowly implementing the good features, like music queue for instance. And my understanding is that Apple has made some things regarding music apps more strict over the years and that's why many players nowadays have various compromises and in some cases have died away.\nSolution #1 - Native music app\n\nFirst of all the way you clear the queue is by clicking a song and then it asks if you want to clear the queue, in which case it does clear the queue but it also adds all the songs in the context of that song to the queue. If the song you clicked was in the album view, it would add all of the songs in the album to the queue and place the clicked song first. So you can't clear the queue just to make it empty. Perhaps if the app crashes, it might clear it.\n\nSo, the only way to get around it, that I see, is by making a playlist with just one song and then clicking the song in that playlist to clear the queue. Don't click the play or the shuffle buttons at the top, just click the song. The only kinda big downside is that you can't remove this song from the queue, which isn't much of an issue as long as that song is something you always feel like listening. Of course you can always skip it too.\n\nI can imagine that you could probably get around that by basically making an empty 2 second audio clip, adding it to the Music app through Itunes and making a playlist out of it. But it might be too much trouble for what it's worth.\n\nSolution #2 - 3rd party apps\nI didn't test every single 3rd party player, so there could still be better options out there.\n\n*\n\n*Picky Music Player - ($2.99)\n\n*\n\n*This player plays the songs through the native app...\n\n*My first pick and really the only solid player I found that fits the bill\n\n*This is actually something I already owned and it has in app purchases... I'm not sure about this Picky Deluxe because I can't see it in the app. Maybe I already bought that... but all the other in app purchases are basically just donations. Which is to say, I'm not sure if this Picky Deluxe in app purchase is something that gives you more features or something.\n\n*Picky's FAQ\n\n*Pros\n\n*\n\n*Works with apple music: cloud and downloaded songs.\n\n*Swipe left on a song to add to the queue\n\n*In the top right of the \"now playing\" screen there's the typical horizontal 3 dot menu where you have a \"Clear song queue\" option.\n\n*In the top right corner of every song list there's a picklist  menu that lets you add multiple songs to the queue or you can choose to play them next, which clears the queue.\n\n*You can swipe the album cover in the \"now playing\" screen left and right to go to the previous or next song.\n\n*I'm not sure if this counts as a pro, but it syncs the queue with the native Music app. You clear the queue in it, it clears the queue in the native app. If you add songs to the queue, they get added to the native app. If you add songs to the queue in the native app, they show up in Picky. If you remove songs from the queue it gets removed in Picky... etc..\n\n\n\n*Cons\n\n*\n\n*The interface overall is pretty good, but now that I've gotten used to the native music player, I'm not a big fan of how the song lists are these very compact lists, without album art in the front.\n\n*Can't edit individual songs in the queue, like say move or remove them. Of course you can add more to the top of the queue or clear the whole queue.\n\n*\n\n*You can however edit individual songs in the queue in the native music app. Picky manipulates the native queue every time you make changes to it and it stays in sync both ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\n\n*MusiQ Player - Queue Music - Free\n\n*\n\n*This app plays song independently from the native music app\n\n*This is like the wet dream of anyone who is into making playlists on the fly... Like wow! (With a huge caveat*)\n\n*Cons\n\n*\n\n**Only works with downloaded apple music songs :( Don't read the pro's if this is a deal breaker because it'll just make you sad.\n\n\n\n*Pros\n\n*\n\n*Swipe right to add song to the bottom of a queue\n\n*Swipe left to add song to the top of the queue\n\n*Clicking a song actually brings it to the top of the queue and starts playing it immediately.\n\n*Long click(press) gives you the option to Play now & Replace Queue\n\n*Queue has it's own tab, which I'm totally into\n\n*There's also a tab for \"Queues\", which is where you can manage or start playing any queues that you have saved.\n\n*\n\n*This is really a con: you can add, remove and rename saves queues, but you can't edit the songs in them in any way. You have to starts playing the saved queue, then make edits in the \"Queue\" tab and save it again :/\n\n\n\n*The queue tab has 2 icons at the top right:\n\n*\n\n*(1st icon) Clears queue - Or if you started playing a saved queue, it resets it to the saved queue... Which is kinda cool, but also I think I should be able to then click the icon again to empty out the queue, but no, the icon gets grayed out :/\n\n*(2nd icon) Saves the current queue into the \"Queues\" tab with the current date as a placeholder name.\n\n\n\n*Also has a swipe left and right over the now playing screen's album art.\n\n*In the \"Queues\" tab you can use the same swipe gestures to add the whole saved queue into the current queue... Awesome...\n\n*You can export saved queues to the native app. Would assume it is imported as a playlist.\n\n\n\n\n\n*AuxBox - Free\n\n*\n\n*This app plays song independently from the native music app\n\n*This was an interesting find. I don't think I'd ever had any use for this but sure enough you can queue up songs and play them... Sort of...\n\n*I'm a little surprised it works with Apple music and Apple hasn't take it down... Well it's not like you can use it as a full on music server because it's on your phone, but still.\n\n*It's sort of like you make a \"radio station\", though they call them \"channels\", where you can add songs from the Music app. And then it just plays that queue...\n\n*Interestingly as soon as a song finishes, it's removed from the queue but the last song sticks around and plays on repeat until you stop or add other songs.\n\n*You can share these channels with friends and when you start a channel it has 2 options: party mode or radio mode.\n\n*\n\n*Party mode: At a quick glance it seems party mode is one where you play music through the phone speakers or to bluetooth speakers or whatever and I guess your friends can... affect the queue somehow? I'm not really sure how that would work but it is called \"party mode\". Maybe they have full control of what's playing now or next, I don't know..\n\n*Radio mode: Again, quick glance says it would be otherwise kinda similar but your friends would be hearing it from their phone speakers.\n\n\n\n*Apparently your friends can add songs to their apple music, if they like the song or whatever.\n\n*Also works with Spotify.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Selecting rather than highlighting in iPad books On my iPad, when I read a book in the books app, a single word gets selected if I hold my finger on it. This allows several options and I prefer this extra tap if I want to look it up, highlight it or whatsoever.\nHowever, if I move my finger to select multiple words, they get highlighted immediately.\nCan I switch that gesture off?\n\nA: On iOS 14 there is no preference you can set in the settings to disable highlight function in general or to change the gesture itself.\n\nIf your device gets bumped often or your touch this triggers highlights too fast, you can enable accessibility to increase the hold detection time and also keep swipe gestures fast to keep page swipes more responsive but the highlight touch time delayed. This is a system wide setting, so you may not like it elsewhere.\nI recommend reading about all the gestures that change if you enable the top most gesture.

It would be super frustrating to have a slow boot and I’m sure with some tests, there’s a reason why it’s slow and figuring and then solving that technical detail would be satisfying indeed.\nAs to the process to quantify this startup, use something other than the power button. Use lid open to wake, press any key or connecting power and also use a camera to time things (or narrate while recording to a watch or phone.) Make sure you test no FileVault and automatic log in on a clean erase / install with nothing connected save the Apple power adapter if you suspect hardware being the cause and not software you loaded. Then enable FileVault, and let it finish encrypting and repeat the test. It will pause for you to log in, but you can subtract that delay later - it shifts the boot order on you.\nThen once you’re sure the timings are repeatable or know the variance, boot to internet recovery and erase everything and reinstall the latest shipping OS and note that build number once booted. Since you’re on beta, you might have pre-release bridge / firmware and need to wait for that to ship if you want to have Apple look over the logs to see if a repair is in order.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nI would not use any install method other than internet recovery and erase install in this case, that ensures you get any bridge, firmware updates slipstreamed into the install process and you do depend on Apple to clean up in the coming months since you hopped on the beta train. If there is something amiss, it should be pretty easy to compare with other similar models and know yours is as fast as them or not. Great work on the 17 sec time - that’s one item to benchmark, but looking at the log files and collecting extra data points might help.\n", "Q: used iphone 8 plus charged battery drain I have bought an used iphone 8 plus yesterday.

You can customize each workout type to include or exclude a dozen metrics for the Outdoor Run type. Indoor run is the same and I don't use it, but the treadmill integration is amazing from what I hear when you sync your watch to equipment that will visually show you what telemetry the watch is broadcasting (with your opt in permission, of course).\n\nHere is what the phone interface looks like for you to alter what is shown during the workout image above.\n\nSo if you didn’t care so much about pace, you could edit out both pace items and see this instead during your run:\n\nGarmin makes some great product, so I would choose based on where you want your data in the end - which app ecosystem is better for you.

Throughout all history of iOS, the icons have had certain dimensions. Now, Apple for some reason decided to ruin this and made them smaller a little bit.

They're 8 pixels smaller, from 122x122 to 114x114, and the space between them is narrower, leaving an excess of unused space to simply make the targets closer and smaller. I have checked this on a 7 and a 2020 SE, both show the same before and after.

I have noticed that some podcasts are different depending on the date I download them. For example, some have different advertisings when I download them again. I also noticed that some podcast episodes are no longer available.\nSo I suspect that podcast files live on the publisher's servers and Apple Podcasts does not host or cache them.\nIs that true? If I update a podcast episode on my server, will all downloads after that get the new version?\n\nA: Apple hosts a directory, Apple does not host the files of podcasts.\nIf you update the file of a podcast on your server, but do not indicate that you've updated it in your RSS feed, then only new downloaders will get the new file (obviously).  If you update your RSS feed to indicate that there is a new file, then many podcast catchers will figure out they need to re-download the file.  Others will simply list it as a new file again.\n", "Q: Charging MacBook Air with a fast charger from usb-c I have a MacBook Air 2020 and forgot my charger at work. Evidently I need to charge it in a few hours. I have One Plus phone with a fast charger which is USB-C compatible (5V, 4A). Could I use it to charge the MacBook Air?  Does this damage the mba ?\n\nA: It shouldn't damage anything, but it might not be powerful enough to keep up.\nThe Macbook Air charger is 30w, which is about 6A.\nAmps are \"pulled\" by the computer rather than \"pushed\" by the power supply [which is the opposite to voltage; this is why voltage has to match but amperage doesn't] however, your charger will be incapable of supplying all the Mac is asking.\nThis will just make charging slower. If you're lucky, it might just keep up, otherwise the battery might still lose charge slowly while the Mac is in use, even with the charger connected.\n\nA: I didn't think it would... but the ubiquitous Apple 12W USB-A iPad/iPhone charger\n\nworks fine for me when my M1 MacBook Air is shut down.  The battery life is good enough to handle moderate use (take measures to minimize drain!) and then I just plug it in when I'm not using the laptop, shut it down and it charges slowly. (USB A to C cable needed)  Definitely needs extra time but is usually charged in a couple/few hours.\nI guess the only question I have about this would be - is there anything wrong with leaving that setup (12W USB-A charger, USB A to C cable, M1 MacBook Air) plugged in while I'm working on the computer?  I have heard that it's best to not drain and charge at the same time.  So I guess more generally I need to research the entire question of charging while using.\n\nA: Apple laptops with USB-C, and the power supplies that come with them, will use USB-PD for charging.  I've discovered that in a situation like yours my MacBook Pro will charge slowly from a 12 watt iPhone power supply that uses USB-BC and Apple's BrickID for charging.\nBased on what I know from USB-PD I believe your One Plus charger does not support USB-PD.  This is because 5 volts at 4 amps is not a valid USB-PD power profile.  A bit of research tells me that this charger is likely using a charger protocol called VOOC or Dash Charge.  These chargers will fall back to USB-BC charging for backward compatibility with older One Plus phones.  The supported USB-BC charging rate from this charger is likely 5 volts at 1.5 amps.  The 7.5 watts you will get from your phone charger is 1/4 what you would get from the Apple charger that came with the laptop.\nI'm quite certain that your MacBook Air will take power from this charger to at least extend the battery life while in use, perhaps even have some power to spare for charging.  I'm quite certain it will charge the laptop while it is powered down or sleeping.  I'm most certain that this will not damage either the charger or the laptop, both have enough \"smarts\" in them to not do anything that will damage them.  The transfer of power would stop before damage is done.\nI'm quite certain my answer is too late to help with your dilemma of avoiding a dead battery, but will hopefully help you or someone else in the future.  One last thing I'll say I'm at least minimally certain about is that it would be wise of you to invest in a spare USB power brick better suited for powering your laptop.  That's assuming you didn't do what I did that forced me to charge my 60 watt laptop from a 12 watt phone charger, temporarily misplace two laptop chargers.\nYears ago I found myself in a spot with a much needed laptop running low on battery and no charger for it in the vicinity.  I keep a spare laptop charger on hand since then.  Today this isn't near the problem as then since USB charging is the norm, chargers are less expensive now and very interchangeable.  The problem we will find today is that not all USB chargers are equal.  The chances of me not having any means of charging my newest laptop is near zero now as I have multitude of USB chargers on hand.  The number of them rated for more than 12 watts though is just two.\nI don't know if a 20 or 30 watt charger exists that supports both VOOC and USB-PD.  If so, and it doesn't cost too much, then getting one might be a wise investment.  A quality 20 watt USB-PD charger can be had for $20, and should provide enough power to avoid running the battery dead on a MacBook Air unless it's run really hard, and will also be a spare 7.5 watt charger for your phone.  A $30, $40, or $50 charger removes the slow charging concern for the laptop, but not for the phone.\nI do wish USB chargers would put on the charger what charging protocol they use, and do so using the same names as everyone else.  VOOC is the same as Dash charge.  Quick Charge is the same as PowerIQ.  What Apple calls \"fast charge\" is just USB-PD by another name.  It also doesn't help when they use such similar names for incompatible charging systems.  Well, they are incompatible for providing more than 5, 7.5, 12, or maybe 15 watts of power.  They will all at least fall back to providing something for power.  There will be no harm done for people that mix up these USB chargers, but mixing the up will get disappointing charging rates.\n", "Q: Why does my mac keep showing the message “Your computer restarted because of a problem”?

At my condo, which I visit monthly, I have a 2010 MBA (High Sierra?) that runs a webcam and performs various other periodic tasks. I don't have an UPS for it, but the internal battery usually lasts long enough to handle power outages. However, this week the condo scheduled an all-day outage in order to do maintenance on the electrical systems. I have the MBA scheduled to \"Start up or wake\" every morning. (This MBA does not have \"Start up automatically after a power failure\".) As expected, the MBA's battery went dead during the power outage. I expected that the battery would charge up after power was resumed and that the MBA would start up on schedule. It did not and remains shut off.\nWhat should I have done differently?\nAt home I have a 2017 iMac running Catalina. It has a UPS with a battery that lasts about an hour after a power outage. When the battery gets low, the UPS sends a shutdown command to the Mac. During a long outage the UPS shuts the Mac down and then turns itself off when the battery dies. When power resumes, the Mac starts up automatically. (\"Start up automatically after a power failure\" is enabled.)\nHowever, this week, while I was away, there was a power outage. The outage lasted long enough for the UPS to shut down the Mac, but power resumed before the UPS shut itself off. So, power to the Mac was never lost. As a result, it stayed shut down and required manual intervention to start up.\nWhat should I have done differently?\n\nA: You might want to consider replacing the MBA with a Mac Mini, perhaps a previously owned model from OWC which as some real inexpensive models. Your needs don't seem to require a superlative machine with lots of RAM & etc. The Mini should be able to provide the startup after power failure option because it is a desktop Mac.\nFor the problem of starting up the iMac in the circumstances you described, you should consider creating a series of Terminal pmset commands which wakes or restarts your Mac with a frequency you find amenable.\nThis example should attempt to wake from sleep or power on the Mac on an hourly basis every day:\npmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 01:00:00\npmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 02:00:00\npmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 03:00:00\n.\n.\n.\npmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 24:00:00\n\nIf the Mac is already up and running, these commands have no effect. A wealth of information is found in man pmset.\nThe app Power Manager may also be helpful as it provides a GUI method for setting the same commands.\nDisclaimer: I have no financial or other ties to the developers of Power Manager, nor in Other World Computing, Inc.\n", "Q: Why \"sudo nano\" can bypass csrutil / SIP when enabled and other apps can't? Initial statement\nI was installing open source ntfs-3g on my mac (Catalina). At some point, while crsutil was enabled (i.e. System Integrity Protection was on) , I had to modify one line in the ntfs-3g package and I couldn't write on the file due to the crsutil protection (I was using vim).\nHowever, I found this answer https://superuser.com/a/1518414/1220896. With nano, I could modify the \"protected\" file without any reboot nor switching crsutil to disable.\nAnd now, I am still trying to figure out how sudo nano can bypass SIP while sudo vim or any other text editor can't (update by the author: here I make the mistake of assuming it was SIP related).\nComplete command:\nsudo nano /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs\n\n/usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs is a soft link to /usr/local/Cellar/ntfs-3g/2017.3.23_3/sbin/mount_ntfs.

I mark this question as solved and will try to find out why sudo vim could only access the file in readonly despite the permissions being well set.\nI thank you all for your input.\nAs a personal not, i would say that sometimes being on the wrong path doesn't mean you can't learn from it --- consider this when replying to someone misleaded like I was.\n\nA: SIP doesn’t matter so much on Catalina. The system volume is read only / protected.\nWhen you say crsutil was enabled, that is meaningless. That tool is always enabled and can run. You would need to report the full status it reports and then reboot the Mac and then specify the full path to a specific file you attempted to modify for someone to be able to check your work.\nI would just set aside all the history and ask a follow on question showing your precise vim failure. That’s quick for people to answer whereas trying to teach anyone how SIP works takes about 2 hours and constant feedback to cover all the nuances. Far too broad for a question here other than the idea to ask a follow up question that documents the specifics.\n\nA: /usr/local is Writable\nThe file path /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs is not protected on macOS.

I want to use my Apple Watch for sleep tracking, and want to use sleep mode so the watch display is completely off while I sleep.\nHowever, I need my iPhone to NOT turn on Do Not Disturb (I need to be able to hear certain app notifications) when sleep mode is activated on the watch. I haven't been able to get this to work yet. Is this possible?\n\nA: You can turn your watch screen off and the watches dnd on with “Theater Mode”, it provides much of what you want. It does not initiate the “time to fall asleep” counter, but other than that works fairly well.\nAs for sleep mode and still getting phone notifications, are they something that you could set up to trigger a text being sent to you? Because if you can, you can set the originating number up as a favorite, and to break thru DnD, and have them come in that way.  Sleep mode has the same rules for Breaking thru as normal DnD.\nLastly I would encourage you to really look at what notifications you feel you need to be getting and If you genuinely need those interrupting your rest? I understand some things are needed, I have some emergency things I have to be available for. But I also get how we are getting so used to always be available, we loose sight of how important it is to put it all aside and get real restorative rest and calm. There is considerable studies showing how difficult it is to calm our brains when our phones are nearby us.\nGood luck and i wish you good sleep.\n\nA: No options seemingly exist to do this combination yet.

I assume one would new to sync in the cloud.\nIs this possible?\nI see the pdfs are in my computer's readers but I cannot have them sync between devices like, say, mendeley or evernote would.\nkindle isn't important. What is important is that my pdfs are available everywhere. Ideally backup with annotations. That doesn't seem to work on either. Thats the crux of my question.

(Like PDF libraries and such)\nThere’s no technical reason Amazon doesn’t use Apple API. It’s just platform, business, privacy, control issues from what I can tell as a developer with access to the API and design docs on Apple side. As a consumer, I am steering more an more of my purchases away from Amazon since their walled garden doesn’t work for me as well as Apple’s walled garden. I love O’Reilly subscription as well so I’m mostly content to let Amazon be Amazon and use a physical kindle when I can’t get what I need elsewhere. I rarely use the kindle apps on Mac since they just make me sad and frustrated, tbh. I don’t blame them (Apple or Amazon), I just use the paper white kindle for what it’s great at and the iPad for what it’s great at.\nAll my PDF are in iCloud now and those I need a proper reader, I open in books or another third party app if I need to mark them up or organize them more rigorously than iBooks allows.

I'm using a 13\" mid-2012 Macbook Air (yes, it's an old machine:)). It's running MacOS Catalina, 10.15.6. It works fine (if sluggishly, no surprise there!), but I'm getting sudden battery shutdowns, and I'd like to use the hardware self-test to see how many cycles the battery has been through. It appears to me that I should be able to start the \"Apple Hardware Test\" on this machine by holding down 'd' during startup, but instead, holding down 'd' takes me to \"Internet Recovery\", which isn't what I want at all.\nAny idea what's going on, and how to access Apple Hardware Test on this machine?\n\nA: Just because you hold d doesn’t mean the signal is correct. Also, I wouldn’t put any effort into running home diagnostics. That only tests for things like “One of the four tires on your car is missing.”\nMy move for this symptom is to call Apple or chat with them online. Ask for them to send you a link to test your battery remotely while the OS is running. That will tell you far more. Also, if you can’t get the os running or erase, reinstall it from recovery, then you have larger issues than even getting diagnostics to run.\nThey will either fix your issue or offer a flat rate repair so you know how much worst case a repair will be.\nIn the end, you’re in the correct screen you need to decide how to move forward despite your wanting a quick diagnostic. You need to get to system information and have the battery specific diagnostics run by Apple at this point.\n", "Q: iPhone XR take a second to go to sleep, instead of going out instantly I got my iPhone XR just days ago and just recently upgraded to IOS 14. Now, the problem I am facing is no way near crazy problematic. However, it is kinda concerning given it's a brand new phone. After updating to IOS 14, it seems like my iPhone is \"taking its time\" to go to sleep. Like initially, I'd press the power button and it would immediately go to sleep but now it actually takes a second to go out followed by the locking sound effect. I don't know if the problem is because of updating to IOS 14 or something else. I hope someone could help me figure this out.\n\nA: The side button won’t immediately sleep your phone if iOS is waiting for a potential second press of the button. Features which enable a second press of the side button and thus delay sleep are:\n\n*\n\n*Apple Pay, where double press of the side button opens the wallet to your cards.\n\n*Accessibility Shortcut (Settings → Accessibility), where triple press of the side button toggles your selected shortcut or opens a menu of your selected options.\n\nDisabling these features will ensure a single press of the side button can only mean sleeping the device, therefore iOS won’t wait for a potential second press.\n", "Q: Can't make WhatsApp calls over Wi-fi on iOS14 I have an iPhone 11.

I have MacBook Pro 2013 (MacOS Catalina) which may no longer receive any software updates few years from now.

Or do some research and testing so see if you can live with throttling after you suss out today’s upgrade costs.\nThe system has to detect a healthy battery since the power supply can not provide enough power to run without throttling. Apple doesn’t do this to be mean spirited, the battery is needed for electrical reasons. You would need a different power supply and to reprogram the controller chips. A cool project, but it’s cheaper to sell the laptop for parts to someone that wants to put a battery in it. That’s a great Mac for the price of a battery. Also, as parts age or you disable the safety and management code on temperature, the risk of a melt down or premature failure goes up. Removing the battery makes a possible fire much less risky so that’s the only plus to having no battery in a portable. It might even restore stability to your setup.\nSame as the drama about iPhone throttling. All CPU can over draw their battery or power supply or overheat if the laws of physics are not obeyed.\nThrottling is there to maintain required voltages and temperatures, not some marketing stunt or planned obsolescence nonsense. You can measure this in a lab if you don’t trust “the man”. (And no one should blindly trust “the man”, be they Apple or Dell or Intel or some young engineer making their first chipset / home repair.)\nAlso, don’t overlook alternate OS.

In other words, I want to make it into a Preference Pane, instead of an Application Bundle.\nI noticed that .prefpane's and .app's use a similar folder structure. Is there any sort of file trickery that will allow me to create a prefpane out of my Applescript without using XCode, similar to how a shell script can be turned into an app bundle by adding an info.plist and placing an executable in the right location?\nAlternately, if this is stupid and XCode is required, can instructions be provided that do not assume prior knowledge of Objective-C or Swift?\n\nNote: I am imagining something like the Java Control Panel, which launches from System Prefences but opens in a separate window. I'm well aware I can't build a proper System Preferences layout with just Applescript!\n\nA: Xcode Required\nNo, Xcode is required to build a preference pane on macOS. A preference pane is a specialised CFPlugIn bundle that registers a set of callback functions. From there, an Objective-C runtime can be set up and a view provided to the host application.\nToday, with macOS 10.15, the CFPlugIn plug-in architecture appears to be supported but not widely promoted by Apple. Applications using plug-ins require additional sandboxing/hardening requirements. I expect they will be phased out or required to operate within their own isolated processes.\nSimple Preference Pane Example\nApple's archived Implementing a Simple Preference Pane provides a tutorial that may be enough to convert your AppleScript approach to a Preference Pane.\nHaving written and supported a commercial product that used a preference pane for much of macOS's early years, I recommend sticking with an application approach.\n", "Q: Mac Mini with Ubuntu how to restore MacOS I have a Mac Mini 2012 Server which has Ubuntu running on it. The issue I have is that I cannot seem to get it to boot from USB at this point in order to reinstall MacOS. Holding down Alt/Option seems to make a keyboard light blink and it waits until I let go. It then promptly boots Ubuntu again. I try Ctrl/Command+R and it boots to Ubuntu again. Same with CTRL+Shift+R.\nI’m guessing the blinking light is the Mac saying it cannot find the recovery partition. Which I get... they were brand new drives right out of the box. The thing I’m confused about is that it is not giving me any option to boot from USB.\nI still have the old drives where one has a 500+ mb EFI partition and the other has a 200+ mb EFI partition. I’m guessing the recovery software is in this partitions. I’m just looking for some guidance on the way to re-install MacOS from USB.\nAnother interesting thing was that I ran efibootmgr and there are references to a location from the Mac drive. One points to a file... the next points to the partition that file is in. Then there are two that are similar to MacOS but if not have that label. It’s my first time looking at this so I’m not sure if I should expect to see an option in the boot list for USB.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: The keyboard light that was blinking helped. Searching for reason where that would happen said there was not enough power to the keyboard. The (non-Apple) keyboard was going through a KVM switch (which actually is powered). So I figured there is something it doesn't like about the keyboard.\nAfter directly connecting an Apple keyboard to the Mac Mini I was able to start the recovery process.\n", "Q: Cannot mount USB hard drive I have a 4TB USB hard drive (WB Elements) that I want to mount On a Macintosh Pro 16.\nUnfortunately it cannot be mounted and the Mac does not show up any error messages.

What is puzzling is that I could mount it a few months ago.\nOn that same Mac, a 2TB USB hard drive could be mounted. Any ideas on how to proceed?\n\nA: I have a 4 TB WD drive connected to my iMac running High Sierra (now Catalina) and it works fine.

This folder is excluded by code in Mojave as far as I can tell. In older OS, the Exclusion list was editable in a preference file named VolumeConfiguration.plist and before that, _rules.plist so it was easier for someone technical enough to use the command line to modify an exclusion and make that folder included. I don't think we get this control via the same mechanism now. Apple still lets us exclude arbitrary folders / files, but relaxing their exclusion list to be more inclusive, may not be possible.\nIf you want to poke at this - the relevant folder is /System/Volumes/Data/.Spotlight-V100\nI would use a tool like ag (easily installed with https://brew.sh) to search by name or content rather than using find in the mean time.\n\nIf you check mdls for the affected files, you can see the various file types these are and possibly find an app that will claim \"indexing\" for them.\nHere's me reproducing that with a Microsoft preference file:\nme@Mac-Pro ~ % mdls ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.autoupdate2.plist\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate = 2020-09-19 20:33:07 +0000\nkMDItemFSCreationDate      = 2020-09-19 20:33:07 +0000\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode       = \"\"\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags       = 0\nkMDItemFSHasCustomIcon     = 0\nkMDItemFSInvisible         = 0\nkMDItemFSIsExtensionHidden = 0\nkMDItemFSIsStationery      = 0\nkMDItemFSLabel             = 0\nkMDItemFSName              = \"com.microsoft.autoupdate2.plist\"\nkMDItemFSNodeCount         = 965\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID      = 20\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID       = 501\nkMDItemFSSize              = 965\nkMDItemFSTypeCode          = \"\"\nme@Mac-Pro ~ % mdfind 'kMDItemFSName == \"com.microsoft.autoupdate2.plist\"'\nme@Mac-Pro ~ % cp -p ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.autoupdate2.plist ~/Desktop\nme@Mac-Pro ~ % mdfind 'kMDItemFSName == \"com.microsoft.autoupdate2.plist\"'          \n/Users/me/Desktop/com.microsoft.autoupdate2.plist\n\nIt's clear Apple has restricted indexing in this directory which is why you can't find preference files in the user Library folder and they show up immediately when copied to your Desktop.\n", "Q: Want to upgrade to Mac OS High Sierra and it shows MediaKit reports not enough space on device for requested operation Trying to update my MacBook from os El Capitan to High Sierra  on reboot it shows MediaKit reports not enough space on device for requested operation\n\nA: Typically this means you need to erase your drive.

Where should I put them? I downloaded a binary file for a shell executable, and the corresponding man pages, from a source I trust. Unpacking the archive returns a binary file and some man pages.

Each man page goes in the folder usr/local/share/man/manN where N is the number at the end of the man page file name. For example, gdisk.8 should appear in the folder /usr/local/share/man/man8. When finished adding all man pages, you should run the command\n/usr/libexec/makewhatis /usr/local/share/man\n\nto update the whatis database stored in the text file /usr/local/share/man/whatis.

That migration is one way and unless someone (Apple or otherwise) writes a reverse migration script and tests it and releases / sells it, you have to do all that engineering work for every single type of data you care about.\nWhat's easy is the following:\n\n*\n\n*Erase your Mac and restore a backup from a time when the backup was on the older OS.\n\n*Erase your Mac and migrate only the apps from the new backup to the old backup. Uninstall / clean any that don't work - then migrate by hand the documents you care about.\n\n*Erase intall your Mac and hand migrate back your data, then install the apps you care about - referring to your backups as a guide if you can't just wait till you need an app, and install it. (seriously - you don't really need things you don't use daily - so don't migrate back a raft of cruft - just start using the new old OS is my best advice - human to human)\n\n*Use iCloud or another service to sync the data - data sync generally works across versions (say you have one Mac on Mojave and another on Catalina - Apple will happily sync photos / music / mail / contacts / reminders across both). Here, instead of having two computers - you have one sync complete - leave the data in the cloud, erase and then sync down the content to the same computer, older OS.\n\nI'm going to stop here since the specifics of what you choose isn't a one-size-fits-all case. If you don't care about anything except files - you could move back pretty easily. If you care about database backed apps - then the list of the apps you care about dictates which operation is best for you.\nI would make a good backup you trust now on Catalina - you will need it to try these above steps - and they may fail - you need to at least be able to get back to now to be free to experiment.\nI use Time Machine - but the people that wrote and support Carbon Copy Cloner and Super Duper are beyond great.

I don’t want to update iPhone to 14 until this works.  Do I need to delete and recreate the email account on iPad (and then on iPhone)? Or will the same thing happen again? What an annoying bug! Thanks.\n\nA: It’s not clear which mail client you’re using, but this isn’t a bug with the native app on iOS 14 and just something that happens.\nSince you have IMAP, I would delete the account from any device you feel is out of sync.

I'd love to just run the installer and put it onto that hard drive on a partition, but I can't run that installer on an Intel-based Mac.\nEDIT: PLEASE DO NOT SUGGEST THE OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED QUESTION, IT IS NOTHING CLOSE TO THE SAME.\nI need to do the following -\nUSING AN EXTERNAL HD with a FireWire port -\n\n*\n\n*Have a bootable installation partition with the OS X 10.4 (or 10.5)\non it.\n\n\n*Be able to build that partition using an Intel Mac.\n\n\n*Have that external HD be recognized by the G4 PowerMac when I boot\nit up and hold down the Option key.\n\n\n*I then want to be able to run the installer and load OS 10.4 or\n10.5, and OS 9 onto other partitions on that external HD with FireWire and designate it as the startup volume for that machine.\nIf no one has any insight, I'm considering the possibility that the firmware for the external drive case FireWire port is somehow not readable by 2001 or so G4 PowerMac. I know that an older Intel-based MacBook Pro running OS 10.6 won't format or partition that when hooked up via USB, and indications are that the error has to do with the USB interface. I'm going to get a couple SATA to IDE converter cards, load the installer disk onto one of these SSD SATA drives, plug it into the internal drive interface and install onto a second, empty one.\n\nA: Maybe this link helps to accomplish what you described:\nInstalling OSX onto PPC using Intel Mac and Firewire\nIf it works, let us know.\n\nA: Yes. We did this all the time back in the day and it was very fussy. The problem wasn’t so much the process of restoring and blessing as much as the issue is firmware drivers and differences in chipsets on Macs as well as controllers in the USB and FireWire external drives. This all interacted in ways that made booting even more fussy than if the drive worked after the system was up and running.\nBrands like LaCie and G-TECH tended to work more universally than others, but it was hit or miss if one drive would work with any arbitrary Mac.\nThat was when everything was new and hardware failures in the boards and cables and drives (and let’s limo in aging / flakey devices with failing ones). You may have to have multiple devices now to get repeatable results if age is making them less consistent.\nMy only recommendation is take excellent notes as you triage things and know this process wasn’t a slam dunk when new due to several very technical details down to which of several manufacturers made the same “part” inside your Mac. To do what you mention reliably, you would consider every single firmware and part in the boot chain from the CPU to the storage.\n", "Q: In Mission Control, is there a way to set-off desktops, to distinctly differentiate them? I regularly have 5 to 8 desktops open. Until recently, I've been using them for apps that are visually distinct, so in Mission Control I could tell which desktop had which apps and documents simply by glancing. Now, however, each desktop hosts the same app and all of the desktops look alike, making it difficult to tell which has which project on it. (I shift them around based on priority as the week goes on.)\nI'm wondering if there's a way to highlight or otherwise set-off desktops——say, by having different colored borders around different ones, much like tags work.\n(I'm running 10.15.6.)\nThanks!\n\nA: Easiest would be to give each one a different background. You could have a background of a single color and change the color for different spaces. You could even make a solid colored image with a large number on it like 1, or 5 and make 10 of these images. Then give each space a different number background.\n", "Q: MacBook not starting / booting after change done in user permissions with sudo I'm having the problem explained in this post: mac won't start after \"sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*\" command.\nThe solution proposed is to reinstall the macOS, which I have done, but unfortunately, the Apple logo black screen is coming and nothing is happening post it.\nWhen I try to erase the disk as explained here: https://support.apple.com/HT208496, Disk Utility displays this error:\n\nMy macOS version is Catalina.\n\nA: I believe you can only erase the partition if it is not the active system partition (i.e. where the MacOS booted is installed).\nYou must boot from the rescue partition before you can do this.\n\nA: Problem: Unable to reboot the Mac due to issue listed above.\nSolution: Backup and Reinstall MacOS\nProblem: Unable to solve the problem because reinstalling MacOS doesn't happen correctly and completely\nSolution: Erase your disk (Ensure backup before you erase the disk)\nProblem: Need to Backup Data before erasing disk\nSolution: https://tanishqdhangar.medium.com/reinstalling-macos-but-need-to-backup-to-google-drive-before-clearing-your-disk-824530101203\nProblem: Unable to erase disk; Couldn't unmount disk\nSolution: Create a new partition (not volume) and reinstall MacOS on the newly created partition.

I recently bought a cheap iPhone 4S, I know it's an old device but I wanna gift it to my mom so she can use it as what it is: a phone. The iPhone 4S is currently running iOS 6.1.3, but the device is blocked so I can't use it as a phone with my actual (and unique carrier, I'm from Cuba). The device seems to only work on Verizon network.\nI was researching and there is (or was?) 3 main methods to unlock a phone:\n\n*\n\n*Paying a company to unlock it via IMEI (I can't do it, because I'm in Cuba and have no access to any kind of card or online methods to pay)\n\n\n*Going to the previous/actual carrier and ask them to unlock it (My actual, and unique, carrier don't do this kind of things, because of Cuba embargo and political stuff).\n\n\n*Using software methods (This seems the best option for me).\nIn my research on option 3 I discovered old and ancients ways to unlock it: SAM method, Jailbreaking it and then installing ultrasn0w via Cydya, but this methods seems to not work as I have tried.\nSo my question is, can I unlock an iPhone 4s (running iOS 6.1.3, but I can upgrade to iOS 9.3.6 (which is the latest firmware by Apple for this device)) for using with whatever carrier I want to?

Since SD cards tend to fail, I would also like to use my iPad Pro to backup the cards to an external SSD drive. A simple copy/paste from one drive (SD) to another (SSD) via the iPad.\nHowever, I noticed that after importing RAW and JPEG files from the SD card to the iPad internal memory, some of the files seemed corrupted: RAW files couldn't be read by Lightroom, and JPEG files were half black or grey.\nA couple of days ago, the same thing happened in the other way round. I processed RAW files in Lightroom for iPad, and when copying the processed JPEG to the external SSD, and viewing them on my PC, about 10% of them were completely trashed:\n\nSo I made a test, that I hope can be reproduced by someone. I'd love to have some feedback or even a solution to this issue. It's really disappointing that the iPad can't handle a copy/paste without corrupting the files...\nFirst, I took a sample picture and made 500 copies on the external SSD. To be sure they're all exact copies, I used PowerShell on Windows to check the file hash. As expected, they're all the same:\n\nThen, I transferred the 500 copies to the iPad's internal storage, using the \"Copy\" and \"Paste\" function in the app Files.\nI renamed the folder in which the pictures are, copied it and pasted it back to the external SSD.\nFinally, with the SSD plugged to my PC, I checked the file hash of the 500 files copied from the iPad, and indeed, some of them are corrupted, as you can see below (take Test (613).png for instance):\n\n\nI am using an iPad Pro 2020 12.9\", with the latest iPadOS 14, and the native app Files to do the transfer. My external SSD is formatted in exFat. My PC is the latest Windows 10.\nI also tried with other kinds of devices: SD cards, cameras, USB thumb sticks, external SSD, SD card readers, USB-C hubs, even changed the cables, that all work perfectly with my PC, and never failed me. It's really coming from the iPad.\nAfter some research, I saw a lot of complaints (slow transfer speed, mainly) that seem to be linked to the format of the external drive, and the fact that iPadOS seems to prefer APFS file format. But APFS isn't an option for people like me, who are using a desktop PC. Plus, the format of my SD cards are set by my camera, in that case, exFAT.\nFinally, though I can understand speed may vary depending on the format of the drive -- corrupting the files is something that shouldn't happen, no matter what format I'm using. Especially for something as basic as importing photographs from an SD card...\nAt this point I don't know what to do, every time I try to copy/paste something, some files get corrupted. I would be grateful if somebody could give me some pointers, perhaps a solution, or simply confirm the issue by reproducing my test somehow.\n\nA: So, I have same issue. Turns out it’s fault of files app. I have corrupted files only when I try to copy from iPad.\nBut there is a way, you can try FileBrowserGO app. Just drag folder from files and land it on disk in FileBrowserGO app. It works without any issues for me, and it’s way faster to!\n", "Q: echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile by using this command getting permission denied?

I am trying to get an .app bundle wrapping a shell script that invokes /bin/bash to be allowed to read a plist file in ~/Library/Mail/V7/MailData/Signatures and to write to other files in that directory. When the app runs and tries to do either action it fails with a permission error (only seen in a console)\nI've confirmed that it works properly when /bin/bash has been given Full Disk Access manually in the Security & Privacy preferences, but it is too cumbersome to direct users on how to do that. I have tried adding my .app as the one given full disk permissions, but that doesn't work\nI have been unable to find a way to force MacOS to prompt the user to give these permissions and based on the TCC debug output (using /usr/bin/log stream --debug --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.TCC\"'), it seems like that is never possible, that MacOS actively says you can't prompt to give full disk access.\n\nA: An way to get around the problem is simply to not invoke /bin/bash, but rather interpret and run the shell script within your own app. For example you could restrict the script language to be a very simple one, so that you do not have to implement full bash scripting functionality (which would be quite an undertaking).\nFor example if the scripts only consists of simply running literal commands, or perhaps a few conditions - then that could easily be implemented directly in the app, or as a simple language interpreter.\nThis would then let the user give your app Full Disk Access, and it would work.\n", "Q: What is the real world difference between 2020 8th generation iPad and 5th generation iPad mini?

Are those worth spending the extra money on the mini or should I stick with an 8th generation iPad?\n(Also about the resolution, iPad mini has less resolution but more ppi, so what is the difference here?)\n\nA: Whether or not something is \"worth it\" is highly subjective - noone can really answer that but yourself.\nIf you compare the displays side by side, you'll see the difference clearly. Are you going to be doing that on a daily basis? - Probably not.\nHowever I would say that the fully laminated display especially makes a big difference in how you perceive the display. This is one of those \"I didn't need it until I saw it, and then I really needed it\" things.\nThe resolution versus PPI is simply because the physical size of the iPad Mini's display is smaller. Even though the resolution is smaller, the physical size is so small, that the number of pixels per inch is actually higher.\n", "Q: Some macOS apps are not launching in full-screen mode I am using macOS Catalina and I noticed that a few apps in my system are not launching in full-screen mode.

The issue is specifically with creating files on an SMB share.\nMy iPad’s Files sidebar has an SMB share (boringly called Shared and located on the Linux machine at ~/Shared) exported by Samba from an Ubuntu Linux workstation on my home network, the same network my iPad’s on.\nIt works for fine for editing files—meaning, if I open a file from an app supporting Files selection, or use the Files app itself to invoke an app using a long-press on a file in Shared, I can modify it, and those changes propagate to my Linux machine’s storage with no problem.\nIt also works for deleting files using the Files app, by long-holding on the file in Shared and selecting Delete Now.\nThe problem arises only when I try to create a new file. If I copy a file into it by what I think of as the “classic Windows method”—finding its original location, long-pressing to Copy, navigating to Shared and doing Paste, I get:\n\nwhich is an error panel reading,\nThe operation couldn’t be completed. Operation canceled\nOperation canceled\nOK\nThe same happens if I try to move a file there by dragging it in.\nIf I try to save a file into Shared directly from an app’s export sheet, I get the same:\n\nI have tried restarting the Linux machine and ejecting and remounting the SMB share on the iPad.\nOne additional possible clue: I thought perhaps doing touch ~/Shared/two-boxes.svg on Linux prior to attempting the creation might work, since editing existing files works. I did this and then tried to paste the two-boxes.svg file, and got the box warning me of overwriting the empty file:\n\nwhich reads,\nReplace Existing Items\nThe file “two-boxes” already exists in this location. Do you want to replace it with the one you’re copying?\nReplace\nKeep Both\nStop\nInterestingly, if I select Replace, I get the same “Operation canceled” error, but then no two-boxes.svg file at all is left behind. On the other hand, if I select Keep Both, I get no error, but also nothing happens—the old file remains and no new file is created.\nOne final possible clue: if I go into Shared in the Files app and try to create a new directory, the Files app itself crashes immediately (I’m sent to the home screen and when I restart Files, it reinitializes its state). But oddly, even though it crashes, it worked: the directory is created and visible on Linux!\n\nA: In reply to a comment from Marian Rainer-Harbach, I wanted to suggest an answer that I’m not 100% firm about, but does reflect my greater familiarity with iPadOS gained over the last eight months. I believe the answer to my question is a firm “no”: iOS and iPadOS apps (including the Files app) cannot create files on an external share except in very circumscribed cases.¹\nThe issue here is with app sandboxing:\nGenerally, apps are restricted to accessing files inside their own sandbox, meaning the files and directories they were installed with. Aside from temporary cache files, this is the only way apps can address files simply by name.\nThis is something I’ve learned from using apps like the Blink ssh/mosh shell, Pythonista, iVim, Termius, and other apps that can provide Unix shell-like access or other ways of specifying files by pathname. I’ve supplemented this learning-by-experience a bit with some research in the Apple Developer docs, but I don’t claim expertise here as an app developer.²\nSo: iPadOS apps can access files contained in their sandbox directory, like /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/$appID, or its subdirectories, by name (in read-write mode if they so choose), but outside that directory (in superfolders or siblings), they only have by-name access to securely-shared componentized resources (nearly always only in read-only mode), and they generally have no visibility at all into other apps’ sandboxes.\nYet iPadOS apps can, obviously, access files elsewhere in at least two circumstances:\n\n*\n\n*An iCloud Documents directory created for the app; and\n\n*Files shared with the app via a Share sheet.\n\nThe iCloud directory is created by the app developer’s using CloudKit, and has a specific naming convention: in the Blink shell, for instance, the files I can find in the Files app under iCloud Drive → Blink are available in the Blink shell under the symbolic link ~/iCloud.\nIf I read that symlink, I can find:\nblink> ls -l iCloud\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 mobile  mobile  91 Mar 17 14:53 iCloud -> \\\n/private/var/mobile/Library/Mobile Documents\\\n/iCloud~com~carloscabanero~blinkshell/Documents\n\nThus, apps using CloudKit can “break out of their sandbox”, but only to the extent of reaching what amounts to a second iCloud sandbox, limited to only their own iCloud Documents data.\nThis is why, since the introduction of iPadOS (iOS > v13) and the Files app, some iPad apps sport a file-opening screen that looks very like the Files app; via the UIDocumentBrowserViewController interface, they give the user the ability to use a Finder-like interface for managing an app’s files.\nHowever, as similar as they look (so similar, in, fact, that you could be forgiven for thinking it was simply Files being used as a helper app), there’s a key difference between this UIDocumentBrowserViewController interface and the Files app: when you tap iCloud Drive in the Files app, you find a directory listing all the various CloudKit-compatible apps you have installed, each as subdirectories you can navigate to. But when you tap iCloud Drive in an app using the UIDocumentBrowserViewController interface, you’re immediately taken to the iCloud Documents subdirectory for that app; you can’t “escape” and look at other apps’ iCloud documents.\nShare sheets are the other way apps can potentially get access to files outside their sandbox. However, this is user-initiated (via a Share operation), and the file-like object the app receives is not accessible simply by pathname. You won’t find an app that includes a “Recents” list with files shared via Share sheet, because once an app has lost reference to a file object given it by handoff from the Share sheet, it no longer has a way to access it again (unlike files in its own sandbox, which it can access at any time by name).\nUsually, that means the app being Shared to has no ability to create a file—that would be mucking with another app’s sandbox by name and isn’t allowed.\n(There’s an exception for “bundles”—objects in macOS/iOS/iPadOS like apps that appear to be files, but are actually directories—on macOS you can right-click on an app in the Finder and choose to “Open bundle” to see this. When bundles are shared with appropriate permissions, the shared-to app may be able to create files inside the bundle.)³\nWhile not fully answering all my questions, I think this background at least explains the issue: except for Shared bundles, apps simply can’t create files anywhere except inside their own sandbox. While the Files app—as a system utility—has greater access than other iPadOS/iOS apps to browse the file tree (including mounts of network drives), it still doesn’t have the right to create files outside its own sandbox by name, which is what would be required to allow the functionality I was asking about.\nWhile app sandboxing exists in macOS—for all apps installed from the Store, and many other apps too, as Apple has pushed developers to implement app sandboxing in their macOS apps—it’s an ever-present security measure in iOS and iPadOS that, unlike on macOS, can’t be ignored by ordinary developers, not even with the coöperation of users (assuming they haven’t jailbroken their devices).\nThe Finder is a macOS app that isn’t subject to sandboxing rules. iPadOS’s Files app looks like Finder, so at its first introduction it was perhaps reasonable for users to expect it to work like Finder, too. But as an iOS/iPadOS app, even though it does have special access, Files still has to play by (most of) the rules—meaning no file creation in random places in the filesystem hierarchy.\n\n¹  This discussion doesn’t really pertain to Secure Enclave storage, which has its own, entirely separate, set of requirements. But it should probably be obvious that the concepts of “Secure Enclave storage” and “network storage” can’t overlap!\n²  This is why I am posting this answer to my own question, but I’m not accepting it unless and until it gets a number of upvotes to suggest it is, in fact, the right answer—perhaps commenters will have corrections or suggestions.\n³  There’s also an exception when an app shares a subdirectory of its own with another app; in the Blink shell, for instance, you can use the command open to give, say, an editor access to text files inside a Blink documents subdirectory. But even in this case, this just allows the other app to open and export to files in the foreign directory; it doesn’t get full read-write access.\n\nA: Having suffered the same problem since ios/ipados 14.5, I switched to using the secure shellfish app which doesn't appear affected by these particular problems.  I wonder if the author of that app, Anders, who is also the author of Working Copy might have any insight.\nI feel a workaround like this is better than fighting sandboxes.\n\nA: I started to experience this issue also (to an SMB share on my Ubuntu 20 media server), most frustrating indeed and I went through all routes mentioned here for re creating the smb share, checking server permissions etc.\nCreating new files/folders or editing existing  (files/folders) directly on the share is absolutely fine, but copying/moving files/folders from iPad local storage or iCloud wouldn’t go at all.\nAfter some time working with various apps and methods I discovered that if I opted to ‘Share’ the file from within https://skyjos.com/fileexplorer/ and choose the required server share location from within the option window then it copied over.\nNot sure how/if ‘Sharing’ (as opposed to copy/move) might use a different set of properties but whatever is going on behind the scenes it worked for me.\nI do have the full version of File Explorer so aren’t sure if the Share method also works on the free version.\n", "Q: How to replace fusion drive and restore MacOS?

Not a fix of course, but may help someone...\n", "Q: Why can't I just dd an entire APFS disk? I've received a new Mac that has come preconfigured with lots of junk.\nNaturally, my first order of business is to wipe the disk and clean install macOS. But first, I want to create a bit-perfect, bootable clone of the disk (which is formatted APFS Encrypted) and keep it on a flash drive, in the unlikely event that I ever need to boot into the original environment.\nI tried to create this clone by booting the machine into Recovery mode, attaching a flash drive of the exact same capacity as the disk and running dd if=/dev/rdisk0 of=/dev/rdiskX bs=64k. I expected this to create an exact clone, especially reading at a raw level via /dev/rdisk. However, the resulting drive is not only unbootable, but none of the APFS structure is preserved - I'm left with an FDisk_partition_scheme partition type and a 0xEE volume.\nNothing in this answer proved useful in making this bootable.\nMore than \"how can I do this,\" I'm wondering \"why can't I do this.\"\nWhy doesn't dd perform the low-level, bit-by-bit replication that I'm looking for? Or, is it doing what I'm telling it to, but there's another factor at play that I'm not aware of?\n\nA: I am going to go out on a limb and assume the OP's new Mac has a boot drive with a 4096 byte sector size and the flash drive has a 512 byte sector size. Using the dd command (as the OP has described) would result in a flash drive, where the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table could be read, because this occurs in the same place regardless of sector size. This would be the first sector (also known as sector 0). However, the GUID Partition Table (GPT) starts at the beginning of the second sector (also known as sector 1). The second sector on the Mac boot drive has a byte offset of 4096. When you used the dd command, the GPT would be placed starting at byte offset 4096, but the actual location should have been at byte offset 512. The result is documented in the OP's question.\nBTW, the same type of problem would occur with the backup (also known as the secondary) of the GPT stored at the end of the flash drive. Although, it would seem unlikely that Mac boot drive and the flash drive have exactly the same total size in bytes. I assume this is what the OP meant by the use of the phrase \"a flash drive of the exact same capacity as the disk\".\n\nA: There are unique identifiers embedded in APFS volumes, so if you copy the entire disk, it breaks the unique information that each disk needs by design.\nMy guess is that DD does the deed, but the results aren’t what you expect.\nThere is excellent software that make bootable clones and respect the design of APFS.\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility - you can restore the boot drive to an external drive and that will be bootable on Catalina and lower. Big Sur is still pre-release so this may or may not hold at launch for the new OS.\n\n*Carbon Copy Cloner - superlative, excellent software and service - https://bombich.com/\n\n*SuperDuper! - excellent software and service, superlative - https://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\nThe why is the design of the filesystem. Some care has to be added to make a clone bootable as opposed to making a forensic copy for analysis or needing that care added afterwards.\n", "Q: External hard drive I use for Time Machine corrupted, won't mount Today I plugged in my external hard drive to back up to Time Machine, but it won't mount.

The drive is encrypted, so I did try diskutil cs unlockvolume 04890072-B347-41EB-AB08-87EC029276D8 -stdinpassphrase, but it tells me \"04890072-B347-41EB-AB08-87EC029276D8 is not a CoreStorage Logical Volume UUID\", even though it shows up on diskutil cs list ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\nSo I guess I'm left with the option of diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk1, but before I say y on Repairing the partition map might erase disk1s1, proceed?, I'm wondering if there's anything else I can do. I know it's likely I'll just have to start fresh with my backups, and I suppose I don't really need the old backups. I guess it's good this happened now rather than when I needed to use them for a recovery.\n\nA: You’ve got the classic dilemma.\nHow much would you pay to get your data back? If you allow fsck to “repair” the drive, it might repair the volume structure by removing references to legitimate files. But to learn that, you have to pay for data recovery.\nYou could say yes and let it repair - it’s often a small error and quickly resolved. But, with Time Machine - you could also wait weeks if there are hundreds of backup intervals of hundreds of thousands of files and Disk Utility chooses to check each and every one.\nFor sure - go get a new external and set up a new backup set. Or skip the problem entirely and just erase this disk and see if it’s fine with the next backup.\nI’d make an estimate of your value of time / the data / getting a new drive. Good luck with your decision.

I would like to install Microsoft One Note.\nWhen I got to app store on the iPad and search for Microsoft One Note, it's not showing up.

A direct copy may have problems because some of the things in ~/Library depend on MAC address, and some may change due to differences in hardware or O.S. version.\nWith 1.3 TB, speed cannot be expected.\nYou’ll have to have nothing else running (not even Time Machine or Spotlight indexing) to avoid error -42.  According to http://www.macwizard.com/errors.html, that means “too many files open.”  If no other apps are running, then report to Apple that Migration Assistant has a bug.  Actually two of them—it should not open too many files, and if it does get that error, it should close some and keep going instead of quitting.\n\nA: I will suggest that you undertake a method that not only copies the source directory from one machine to another but also copies that source to a third backup / archive drive. Time Machine + Migration Assistant has been mentioned. Another option is a third-party backup/archiving utility such as Carbon Copy Cloner. Finally, as you note, you can try to decode the right ways to do the transfer via the shell commands.\nSet up the process to copy/clone/backup the source to the external drive.

NeXT wanted to revolutionize the Personal Workstation. They built both a powerful computer, the NeXT Computer (later NeXTstation and NeXTcube), and a powerful, modern Operating System, called NeXTStep. (Get it? The next step for the next computer. Really creative naming.)\nThe Operating System was based on porting BSD to a Mach microkernel, and adding object-oriented system libraries, frameworks, and toolkits (called \"kits\", which you can still see in Apple's naming today), with an object-oriented GUI framework and desktop, with object-oriented applications, all written in a modern object-oriented programming language (Objective-C) as the systems language, on top of the base BSD system. The display system was based on PostScript, and there was even an Intel i860 coprocessor running a stripped-down version of the OS, only for Display PostScript processing, plus a powerful DSP for video and audio processing.\nNeXTStep pioneered many things we see in modern GUI programming. It had one of the first graphical GUI Builders, which still to this day is how you design GUIs for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, etc. (Today, it is called the Xcode Interface Builder.) It had the first ever App Store. When Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, he chose NeXTStep as the OS to write the first browser for. Many game studios used NeXTStep and NeXT workstations for their development, e.g. id software for Doom, Doom 2, and Quake. Lotus Improv, still considered by many to be miles ahead of Excel even now, was implemented on NeXTStep.\nLater, NeXT divorced the higher-level frameworks from the underlying OS and made them available under the name OpenStep for Windows NT, Sun Solaris, and under the name \"OPENSTEP for Mach\" still based on the same underpinnings as the original NeXTStep.\nAt this point, Apple had tried and failed multiple times to modernize MacOS, and they bought NeXT (thus bringing Steve Jobs back into the company) and all of its Intellectual Property and technology to develop a successor to MacOS based on OPENSTEP for Mach. They modernized the Mach kernel from 2.5 to 3 and extended it with concepts from the FreeBSD kernel to form a kernel known as xnu (a reference to the failed nuKernel project at Apple which was to develop a \"new kernel\"), and the BSD underpinnings from 4.3BSD to 4.4BSD and later FreeBSD.\nMost importantly, they extended and expanded the OpenStep APIs and built new APIs on top. The collection of those APIs is known as \"Cocoa\". They also built an API called \"Carbon\", which was a close, but not identical re-implementation of a subset of the MacOS API on top of the new foundations. (The intention was that while it would not be possible to simply re-compile existing MacOS applications, it should be fairly easy to port them to Carbon, and then over the years rewrite them in Cocoa.)\nThe first prototype of this system was called Rhapsody. The full system wasn't finished in time, so a subset was released as MacOS X Server 1.0. And the rest is history: Rhapsody became MacOS X, then OS X, then macOS, and somewhere along the way, iOS was split off, and then further divided into iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS.\nNow, back to Darwin: Darwin is basically the underpinnings of macOS, from the xnu kernel, IOKit, drivers, etc. up to the BSD libraries and userland, plus some macOS-specific developments such as mDNSresponder and launchd. It does not, however, include any parts of what used to be OpenStep, Cocoa, Aqua, Quartz, QuickTime, or any of the other higher-level stuff. It does contain drivers and filesystems, although I am not entirely sure whether APFS is part of Darwin.\nIf you think back to the point in time where NeXT \"divorced\" the high-level OpenStep from its underpinnings, the low-level parts that are not OpenStep would be the ones that would later become Darwin.\nIn the beginning, Apple used to make Darwin available as a separate OS, including compiled binaries, installers, ISOs, etc. that you could install on Apple hardware. However, for many years now, Apple only provides a source code dump, every time a new release of macOS comes out. It isn't even possible to compile this source code, because it depends on Apple's internal build tools and build pipeline. There have been some projects trying to patch Darwin to compile it with publicly available tools, but those projects have all died from lack of interest.\nSince all of the things you mentioned were born on Unix and use Unix APIs and Unix libraries, they actually typically don't even know about the \"non-Darwin\" parts of macOS, so it is only logical that they will consider the OS to be \"Darwin\". Note that \"Darwin\" is also what gets returned as the name of the OS when you call the Unix/POSIX int uname(struct utsname *buf) library function or the uname Unix/POSIX commandline utility.\nSo, to answer the question you didn't ask explicitly but is implicit in your question: why does Node.js return \"Darwin\" for the name of macOS? Because when Node.js asks macOS for its name, that's what macOS tells it its name is!\n\nA: From Wikipedia, Darwin is an open-source Unix-like operating system first released by Apple Inc. in 2000. It is composed of code developed by Apple, as well as code derived from NeXTSTEP, BSD, Mach, and other free software projects.\n\nA: Darwin is the core upon which macOS (previously Mac OS X, and OS X) runs on.\nIt is derived from NextSTEP, which itself is built upon a BSD and Mach core, but Darwin is the open source portion of macOS.\nHistorically, when Apple bought NeXT in the late 1990s, they built upon the NeXT operating system (NeXTSTEP) to form the basis of the next version of the OS for the Mac.\nSee Wikipedia's Darwin entry for more details.\n\nA: Here is a quote from the book Take Control of the Mac Command Line with Terminal\n\nWhen Apple bought NeXT in 1996, they began building a new operating system that extended and enhanced NeXTSTEP while layering on\ncapabilities (and some of the user interface) of the classic Mac OS.\nThe result was Mac OS X (later renamed OS X and now macOS): it’s\nUnix underneath, but with lots of extra stuff that’s not in other versions of Unix. If you took macOS and stripped off the graphical interface, the Cocoa application programming interfaces (APIs), and all the\nbuilt-in apps such as Mail and Safari, you’d get the Unix core of macOS. This core has its own name: Darwin. When you work in the command-line environment, you’ll encounter this term from time to time.\n\n\nA: There are lots of ways to fingerprint an OS, but a canonical method for this on unix-like systems is to call uname Which outputs Darwin on all macOS versions and builds.\nApple publishes the source code to the Darwin part of the OS so you can inspect the code that matches the name.\nhttps://opensource.apple.com/release/mac-os-x-100.html\nIf you want to see this yourself, open a shell (in Terminal.app) and you can generate the Darwin string and read the manual page for uname command or the system call (man 3)\nuname\nman uname\nman 3 uname\n\nHere's a nice example of a program needing to know which system is running by calling uname from a shell script. It then adjusts syntax and variables to do the same task on various OS:\n\n*\n\n*https://opensource.apple.com/source/QuickTimeStreamingServer/QuickTimeStreamingServer-452/Buildit.auto.html\nI'll leave the \"Why did human beings do this\" for another time - that story is rich and multifaceted and there's tons of stories documented publicly on the Internet for the curious.\n", "Q: Is it possible for iPhone's MAC or other network specifications to change through update to IOS 14? NOTE!!!\nI already know that MAC address is static and is about the hardware's address. But i don't know what's happening,\nHere is what got me wondering.\nOn the router in our house I set MAC filtering so that only our devices can connect.\nRecently after i updated my iPhone 7 to IOS 14, i had my phone joined to the same wifi, but once i felt like i have a slow connection, i changed network to mobile data.\nAfter a couple of days i found out that i don't have any message or email notification popping up when I'm on WiFi and there was the time i knew i have no access although I'm connected to the WiFi network.\nSo i searched for solutions. People suggested restarting my phone, resetting network setting and these sort of things(non of em worked).\nJust a few minutes before, i reset the router and as a result, all the MAC restrictions are gone and its working properly.\nI also think there might be other things that could change through this reset, but i cant work it out.\nMoreover i changed the router's configuration (network name and passphrase) a couple of times before; another waste.\n\nA: Yes, iOS 14 introduces a new type of MAC address randomization named \"Private WiFi Addresses\". This means that iOS selects a new, random MAC address for each WiFi network you connect to. Note that only the first time you connect a new address will be chosen - it stays the same for that network the following times you connect.\nYou can disable this behavior from the Settings app on the phone. Choose WiFi and then press the (i) button for the network in question. Ensure that \"Private Address\" is not enabled.\n", "Q: How to install iOS 14 on an iPhone 6? I use an iPhone 6 (16-GB) and it's up to date with iOS 12.4.8 (it does not support running iOS 13).\nDoes the App Store just identify my phone as iPhone 6 via a physical identifier in the phone, and that prevents me from downloading any iOS version beyond 12.4.8? How might I get around this?\nMaybe the drivers for the camera and fingerprint reader in the iPhone 6 are not in iOS 13? But, I might be ok without both of those. Losing GPS, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth would not be ok.\nSo, I'd like to just give iOS 14 on an iPhone 6 a look and learn something by doing this. But, I'll probably buy a new phone.\n\nA: I think the main difference between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s that stops iOS 14 supporting the iPhone 6 is probably the fact that the iPhone 6 has 1GB of system RAM (not storage), and the iPhone 6s has 2GB of system RAM.\nThere is not a lot that could be done to make an OS designed to run in at least 2GB of RAM, work on a system with only 1GB of RAM.\nEven if you were able to persuade iOS 14 to install on an iPhone 6, it would run like a dog, if it would run at all.\n\nA: iPhone 6 does not support running any version of iOS beyond iOS 12.5.1. So it's not possible to install iOS 14 on it.\nApple routinely drops supports for older devices when releasing a new version of iOS. But also, there are some years when Apple does not drop support for any older device. E.g. All the iOS devices that supported running iOS 13 can also run iOS 14.\nNow to answer your specific questions:\n\nDoes the App Store just identify my phone as iPhone 6 via a physical identifier in the phone, and that prevents me from downloading any iOS version beyond 12.5.1?\n\nYes. There is a physical identifier associated with every iOS device generally referred to as A model number. Depending on the variant the A model number for iPhone 6 could be any of A1549, A1586 or A1589.\n\nHow might I get around this?\n\nThere is no official way to get around this. iOS 12.5.1 is the highest version of iOS that you can install and run on an iPhone 6.\nYou need at least an iPhone 6s or later to run iOS 14.\n", "Q: Use iOS dictation on macOS There is a huge difference in voice recognition accuracy between macOS and iOS. I don't know if this is because I use dictation more frequently on iOS or because they use a different engine on the two systems. To benefit from the good results on iOS I dictate my texts to Notes on iOS and paste it to whatever app on macOS by using the virtual clipboard (aka Handoff). But that is not a very smooth workflow.\nIs there any way to use iOS dictation on macOS? Or to transfer some sort of \"user database\" from iOS to macOS? Must be a common problem.\n(I still use macOS Mojave 10.14.6. But I can't imagine that Catalina will make any difference…)\n\nA: No. (Not yet) I would make sure you optimize your microphone setup and then retest to be sure the results are reproducible.\n\nMy educated guess is the Apple Silicon chips in iOS give Siri and edge over Macs without T2 chips even on those, you may be right and see differences in the two OS.\nThe thing you can control for now is checking that your microphone for the Mac is as personal and close to your vocal cords as your watch / phone / pad / pod are.\nProper mic makes a massive difference in Siri no matter which engine you use in my experience. The ability to be close due to size and also different hardware makes the biggest difference for me.\nI would probably not use Bluetooth microphone for your tests either. Hard wire is best for Siri if you can accommodate it.\n", "Q: \"Battery is not charging\" after updating to MacOS Big Sur I just upgraded my MacBook Pro to MacOS Big Sur Version 11.0 Beta, and my battery, even though the power adapted is connected, is showing the message \"Battery is not charging\", while displaying this (new) icon:\n\nMy Mac is indeed not charging, even though the battery source is the power adapter. How is it possible to solve this issue?\n\nUPDATE: This looks like a new feature of MacOS Big Sur. In the Battery settings, there is a new option called \"Optimised battery charging\" which stops battery charging after 80% to reducing battery ageing.

In the Battery settings, there is a new option called \"Optimised battery charging\" which stops battery charging after 80% to reducing battery ageing. By unchecking this option the battery starts charging again normally.\n\n\nA: Theres also a button when you click the icon to \"charge to full now.\" However, its recommended to keep optimized battery charging on so your Mac battery can be prevented from aging quickly.\nto SMBiggs\nthat button comes when your Mac will say \"charge complete by [time] or charging on hold (rarely used on battery)\nI cant make that button come on demand, it is in the menu bar after clicking on battery icon\n\nA: Resetting and trying a different charger worked for me. How bad from Apple to drop such a bad feature on old MacBooks.\n\nA: I’m sure this is a feature added to extend the battery life.  You have the option to turn this off if you want to stick with the old method of charging.\n", "Q: How to tile windows without going into full screen? Currently, if I want to tile two instances, I press the green button on the top-left and place the instance accordingly.\nHowever, each of the tiled instances always go into full screen mode. For a chrome instance, this is annoying as it means it's not possible to see the tabs.\nHow do I tile windows without making them go  full screen?\n\nA: If you press the Option button, then open the Window menu, you will the see that Tile Window to Left of Screen will now read Move Window to Left Side of Screen.\nTo make this easier, I mapped keyboard shortcuts for CommandControlLeft Arrow and Right Arrow to do this.\nOnce you map these shortcuts, these options will show up in the Window menu permanently without needing to press the Option key\n\nA: The best option for me was to create keyboard shortcuts. You will need to use the exact text for it to work.\nUnder: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts > +\nAdd the following 'Menu Title' shortcuts to whatever key combination you prefer.\ne.g. I used ⌘ CMD + ⌃ CTRL + ←\nMenu Titles:\n\n*\n\n*Zoom - resizes window to fill screen, without going \"fullscreen\".\n\n*Move Window to Left Side of Screen - resizes window to the left 50% of the screen (no tiling).\n\n*Move Window to Right Side of Screen - resizes window to the right 50% of the screen (no tiling).\n\n\nA: Pressing the green traffic light button would cause the window of most macOS apps to go full-screen.\nYou can press and hold the Option key when clicking on the green traffic light button to prevent the window from going into full-screen mode.\nIf you want to tile and align various windows belonging to same of different apps, you can use one of the many 3rd party window and tiling manager apps.\nOne such app that I use and find very useful is Divvy - Window Manager. It lets you tile windows quickly and efficiently for any macOS app and supports multiple displays too.\nP.S.: No affiliation whatsoever with the developer of the app. Just a satisfied customer.\n\nA: Rectangle will let you do this by keyboard shortcut ($0).\nMoom will actually modify those buttons for you and give you keyboard shortcuts and customizations and more. Highly recommended. $10, but there's a free trial at the link.\n", "Q: How to find out when and where backup recovery password was set for iPhone backups? I had to get my iPhone camera repaired and I had to back it up and erase it so that the repair shop could access the camera app without being able to access my data. After picking it up after the repairs I wanted to restore the backup but had to enter a password. All passwords I could think of are wrong. iCloud password, Mac password, iPhone passwords, pins, and all other sorts of passwords.\nWhen and where was this hellish password set? There was no prompt asking me for a password before backing up my phone. I have spent hours entering passwords and nothing works. It is unbelievable that this is not using my Apple password, Mac password or any other device password.\nI am starting to lose it. The thought of me losing all my data forever is just crushing me right now \nIs there anything I can do to either recover the password or at least find out when and where it was set so that I can at least get a hint or reminder as to what the password could be?\nEdit:\nI should mention that I did look through my keychain and couldn't find anything with \"Iphone backup\" or \"iOS backup\". My Macbook pro is from late 2017 and I never did an iphone backup before. I really don't remember ever setting a password :/\nA friend told me to call Apple. There is probably no chance they can help me in this, right?\n\nA: The password used for local iPhone backups is set when enabling encrypted backups. When checking the box to use encrypted backups, a dialog asks you to enter a new password. This is independent to your Apple ID or other passwords.\nYour Mac stores the password in the login Keychain and uses it for future backups. To get the password from the Keychain, open Keychain Access.app, search for ‘iPhone backup’ or ‘iOS backup’ and open the item, then choose ‘Show password’ and enter your Mac account password to view the backup password.\n", "Q: Workout sync from Watch to iPhone is unreliable since iOS 14 update Since updating to iOS 14, about 20% 50% of my workouts fail to sync from my Watch to my iPhone. I've restarted both Watch and iPhone, several times. Quit and relaunched the Activity app in iOS. All to no avail.\nThe information from missing workouts is also not present in Health. So basically Watch now no longer can be used for its primary function.\nIt's so bad, that I even get nonsense like this:\n\nHow do I restore the missing workouts and get sync working again, or is this another iOS 14 bug?\n\nA: It’s official, Apple published an article that to me explains the update had some problems and our devices may not fix themselves. It also warns of future data loss. I got bitten by the GPS bug and was not successful in fixing it by unpairing the watch, but I will follow this sequence later today once I close my rings :-) Looking closer at noise data - that's off for me and my watch isn't unlocking my Macs anymore so I'll want to restore my iPhone and watch together (first unpairing the watch, then backing up the phone, then erasing the phone and restoring / repairing)\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211865\n\nIf you updated to iOS 14 and watchOS 7 and are missing Activity or Health data, learn what to do to prevent future data loss.\nAfter updating to iOS 14.0 and watchOS 7.0, you might notice:\n\n*\n\n*Your\nworkout route maps are missing in the Fitness app on iPhone for\nprevious GPS-enabled workouts from your Apple Watch.\n\n*The Activity,\nHeart Rate, or other health-related apps fail to launch or load data\non your Apple Watch.\n\n*The Fitness app or Health app fail to launch or\nload data on your iPhone.\n\n*The Health app or Fitness app is reporting\nan inaccurate amount of data storage on your iPhone.\n\n*The Activity app\nis reporting an inaccurate amount of data storage on your Apple Watch.\n\n*Your environmental sound levels data or headphone audio levels data\nfrom Apple Watch is missing in the Health app on iPhone.\n\n*Increased\nbattery drain on your iPhone or Apple Watch.\n\nIf you experience two or more of the above issues, follow the steps below.\n\n\nOld information for context before Apple acknowledged this issue.\nI had this once in the past and needed to work with Apple Support to enable a support PIN so they could see my workouts sync to the cloud and diagnose the errors. In the past, they identified something the server code could clean up and all the workouts synced within 2 days of the fix.\n\n*\n\n*They walked me through one additional quick fix you didn't mention - unpair the watch and re-pair it.\n\nUnless this is a widespread bug, the sooner you start with support, the less likely you'll lose your workouts if that's your primary goal. For a data point, I've logged dozens of workouts since upgrading all my devices on the initial day updates were released. My account hasn't needed anything, but there was a sync error in the past that caused this precise error. (In hindsight, every one of the workouts that synced were missing GPS data - so my failure wasn't initially evident as I didn't review ALL the data after seeing the initial parts correct.)\nThey told me if I wanted to wipe and lose all activity from the watch, I could unpair it, then back up the iPhone to the cloud and then wipe the phone from Finder, then it would all download - but since I had a lot of photos, I declined that and waited out the fix for the sync error they identified based on looking at the logs on the device. The concern was the backup to the iPhone wasn't guaranteed based on the logs as that used the same sync code as the workout sync.\n", "Q: How to make the Wifi of Airport Extreme and Macbook go back to 802.11ac? It was 99.99% of the time my Macbook and the Apple Airport Extreme were connected by 802.11ac, and today, nothing has changed, and they were shown to be connected by 802.11n all of a sudden, and it has been so for hours. (by pressing Option and clicking on the Wifi icon on the task bar).\nHow do I make it jump back to 802.11ac?\n\nA: You can try simply turning WiFi off and then on again from the WiFi icon in the top bar.\nIf it still doesn't work, you'll need to check if you've made settings changes on the router - or if some source of interference has been introduced to the environment (such as another WiFi access point, or other electronical equipment). If this is the case, you can sometimes work around it by changing the WiFi channel used on the Airport Extreme from its settings.\n", "Q: Homebrew: Your CLT does not support macOS 11.0 I recently upgraded to macOS Big Sur developer Beta 8, when I do brew install jenv I get the error Homebrew: Your CLT does not support macOS 11.0.

Apple Time Capsule related technical question.\nIn short, - does there exist a way to disable at the Time Capsule the SMB signing feature?\nRegarding the original SMB1 protocol, the signing mechanism is slowing down the overall performance extremely. For example, writing to the Time Capsule network share is over a Gigabit LAN connection at around 15 MB/s and goes down to around 2 - 3 MB/s when a lot of smaller files are transferred.\nThis behavior is SMB1 related and is therefore present on different operating systems and (older) NAS network devices. Newer SMB2+ versions have a different, more efficient, design which results in much reduced overhead in conjunction with the signing feature. I can confirm this for several older Windows 7 computers where their (SMB2 based) network shares can handle transfer speeds up to 100 MB/s.\nThe usual solution is to disable the SMB signing. This can be done on macOS (and other OS) quite easy: https://dpron.com/os-x-10-11-5-slow-smb/\nIn my case, however, it is somewhat more complex. Regarding the Time Capsule -- I had to do this at the \"server side\" which is effectively the Time Capsule. I have experimented to deactivate the signing at the client side (Mac OS, Windows 7) but it shows no effect. The SMB1 network share speed is always very slow because the SMB1 signing remains active.\nSo, my idea is to find a BSD command which deactivates the signing at the Time Capsule. The earlier Time Capsule models (up to the fourth generation) are NetBSD 4.0 based. The last model, the fifth generation, is based on NetBSD 6. There exists a non-official way to access the Time Capsule through SSH. ;-)\nAnd finally, a switch to the Apple AFP protocol is not a real solution because the Time Capsule share is also used under Linux and Windows. AFP is therefore only a solution for macOS based systems. However, Apple itself regards AFP as deprecated. It is no longer supported with the new APFS file system. Apple uses for APFS based network shares newer SMB versions.\n\nA: Okay, here follows a litte addition to my original question. This is not a final answer. It can be seen more as the first part of a \"real\" solution. ;-)\nAs mentioned in the comment section by user Gumminando, Apple is using at the Time Capsule a (modified?) Samba Server. According to the official doc the SMB1 \"server signing\" feature can be defined in the smb.conf file as follow:\n(Source: https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html)\n\n*\n\n*server signing = default\n\n*server signing = auto\n\n*server signing = mandatory\n\n*server signing = disabled\n\nApple is using at their TC models most likely the mandatory parameter which enforces the SMB1 signing in any case.\nIt should be noted that all these options are only SMB1 related. The SMB2 signing (of newer Samba versions) cannot be disabled because it seems to be \"in design\" mandatory. Well, a SMB2 functionality is not present at any Apple Time Capsule model so that aspect can be ignored anyway.\nSo what would be now the final solution? In theory, you just have to log / hack into the TC and modify the smb.conf file with parameter server signing = disabled or server signing = auto. Unfortunately, it's not that easy in practice.\nHowever, I can confirm that the slow SMB1 signing affects primary larger files. I have now tested this for a while and the overall behavior with smaller files like office documents is okay. Well, this may be true in our case because the original TC hard-disk drive was replaced with a Crucial MX500 2TB SSD. Yes, this works GREAT.\nAnd finally, the idea to use also under Linux the AFP protocol to access the Time Capsule seems interesting. Unfortunately the current AFP Linux implementation is somewhat broken (and incomplete). The SMB1 implementation may be slow but it is definitely very stable and reliable. I would describe it as rock solid.\n", "Q: How can I use the /home directory on Mac OS X : revisited I would like to mount /Users to /home on my macbook (Catalina Version 10.15.6).\nI have three systems: an Ubuntu laptop, a rhel server and a macbook. I have some python scripts (written by others) that uses configuration files where full file paths need to be mentioned (no ~). I don't like changing the home path in the scripts from /Users/x to /home/x multiple times.\nThere's this question on SO about the same thing but three years have passed and I wonder if anything has changed. The person who wrote the accepted answer himself recommend doing something else and I can not do that. I am genuinely concerned about two things:\n\n*\n\n*Automatic back up of this folder.\n\n*Will a system update wipe this folder out?\n\n\nA: Personally I'm convinced that any software requiring hard coded paths to home directories is broken and needs to be fixed, but I understand that this isn't possible sometimes. So in your situation I would just disable the auto mounter for /home (see How to remove '/home' directory?) and then symlink /home to /Users. This also solves the backup issue.\nPS: Biggest risk probably is that a future update will rewrite auto_master but that you can easily fix again.\n", "Q: Can I turn off display on my macbook when I'm using extended display, without closing the lid? I'm using MacBook's keyboard to work on it, but I'm also using the extended display for work. I'd like to turn off the MacBook's screen without closing the lid while using the external display.\nMy searches so far have revealed that this is not supported (unless I mess with some terminal commands, which I don't want to as I'm a relative newbie with Macs), but I'm wondering if I may have missed some source?

Turn down the brightness on your laptop all the way down to zero.\n", "Q: Is it taxing on the mac computers' performance to have multiple user accounts and not log out of them? I have separated my digital life into 2 user accounts on my macbook into work and personal. In order to switch between these two accounts more easily I usually lock the screen and switch to the other account without logging out.\nI was curious if this is costly on my machine's performance? One other way I'd like to ask this question is, do you think mac OS stores a \"snapshot\" of the user account in the storage to be reopened when you unlock the account? or is it taking up space in the memory this way?\n\nA: macOS is a multi-user system so any application opened by any user stays open til it gets closed. You can have a look at Activity Monitory to see that even with just one user logged in there is a lot of additional stuff going on in the background. A lot of these processes usually sleep/wait for any input, the same is valid for user applications which often are sleeping (with their memory swapped to disk) if they aren't actively used.\nIf you have a set of applications (i.e. M, N, O, X, Y, Z) you regularly use it doesn't make a significant difference on memory or CPU needs whether you use all of them within the same account or use Fast User Switching to switch between account A (running applications X,Y, Z) and account B (running M, N, O).\n\nA: The answer is it depends on what you do under each profile.\nThere is no snapshot as such, but any processes (Programs) that you have running under each account will keep running under these credentials in the background as you switch between the accounts but don't log out.\nThe hit to performance by having two accounts and using your macbook like this depends on what type of programs you are running under each account and if they are processor or memory intensive.  If you do run memory and processor intensive applications under either account you may experience degraded performance.\nMy recommendation would be to log out the account you are not using and logging back in when you need it that will save on both memory and processor cycles.  If you don't experience a noticeable slow down with the both accounts logged in it may be faster and easier for you to just let both of them be \"logged in\".\nYou can use the commands top -o cpu to dynamically view which applications are using the most memory and ps aux|grep <username> to see what applications are running under each user profile. top will also show you the memory usage and you can sort by memory if you like.\nThe Activity Monitor app will also show you how much CPU and memory is being used by each account.\n", "Q: iMac 18,3 with dual external 5K monitor I would like to run a iMac 18,3 (Radeon Pro 580, i7 4.2 GHz) with two external 5K monitors (LG 27\" 27MD5KL).\nIn Apple's description (https://support.apple.com/kb/SP760?locale=en_US) I found:\n\nTwo Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports with support for:\nDisplayPort\nThunderbolt (up to 40 Gbps)\nUSB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps)\nThunderbolt 2, HDMI, DVI, and VGA supported using adapters (sold separately)\n\n\nHowever, this document also states that two 5K external displays are not supported:\n\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display\nat 1 billion colors and:\nOne 5120‑by‑2880 (5K) external display at 60Hz with support for 1 billion colors, or\nTwo 3840-by-2160 (4K UHD) external displays at 60Hz with support for 1 billion colors, or\nTwo 4096‑by‑2304 (4K) external displays at 60Hz with support for millions of colors\n\n\nIs there anything I could do to run two external 5K monitors? E.g. replace the iMac's graphic card or use an eGPU?\n\nA: According to Apple, your iMac supports the following as second displays:\n\nThis model can simultaneously support the internal display at full native resolution and up to one 5120x2880 (5K) external display at 60 Hz with support for one billion colors; two 3840x2160 (4K UHD) external displays at 60 Hz with support for one billion colors; or two 4096x2304 (4K) external displays at 60 Hz with support for millions of colors. It supports both extended desktop (second workspace) and video mirroring (internal display duplicated on the external display) modes.\n\nThis means that only one 5K external monitor is supported. Two 4k monitors are supported however. I suspect this is due to the throughput of Thunderbolt, which is 40Gbps. A 5k monitor requires 28 Gbps alone. Also, you can not daisy chain the video connections, so you will need a thunderbolt dock with either displayport or HDMI port connectors for the monitors.\nIn response to questions below:\nA Thunderbolt dock doesn't change the throughput of Thunderbolt or the Mac, it just adds additional connections. So, the dock will not allow two 5k monitors. It only provides additional connections. Now, perhaps your iMac already has two Thunderbolt/Displayport connections on the back to support the 4k monitors (not sure). If not, this is the role of the Thunderbolt dock, so you should purchase one with the needed connectors (they are all different so consider wisely).\nAn eGPU can drive your desired 5k monitors, but you will have to research the available eGPU options to find support for your configuration.\nNote that the biggest limitation in this is the cable and connectors: Apple introduced 5K in iMac first, because Thunderbolt 2 only supported 20Gbps, which is not enough bandwidth for 5k, so they built the monitor into the system and created a sort of dual Thunderbolt 2 connection inside.\nThunderbolt 3 introduced 40Gbps, allowing 5k (Thunderbolt used mini-displayport connections and now usb-c style connections). Displayport connections (minidisplayport on Macs can support 5k with some displayport1 and all displayport2, which is on the Mac. For HDMI connections, HDMI 1.2 can support 1080p, with HDMI 1.4 needed for 4k. To get 5k, you need to have support for, and a cable that offers HDMI 2/2.1. Even then, most systems get 5k by compressing the signal.\nSo to get dual 5k on your system, you will need to use Thunderbolt to an external GPU, and then either Thunderbolt or HDMI 2.x from the eGPU to the Monitors, which means you need the proper monitors as well.\n", "Q: Disable screen auto-rotate on iPhone XS Max How to disable automatic screen rotate on iPhone XS Max ?\nI'm not finding that option to disable it in the settings.\n\nA: I found it.\nSteps :\n\n*\n\n*From the top, do left swipe to open Control Center.\n\n*Then, there is an option Portait Orientation Lock.\n\n*Tap on that to make it On.

Question\nHow can I select a specific audio device before placing a call on my iPhone, without setting a new default device?\nBackground\nDuring a call, I can route the audio to several different devices - my iPhone's speakerphone, various Bluetooth devices, iMac, MacBook Pro, etc. This works well when switching devices during the call. I can also easily answer a call from any of these devices.\nHowever, I cannot figure out how to select another device before placing a new call, and just for that call.\nUse Cases\nMy most common use case is when I'm already listening to audio on my iMac or MBP with (wired) headphones and need to place a call that requires me to continue using the headphones connected to the computer.\nIf I place the call first and then switch the audio to the computer, the other party often answers before the switch completes, and I've missed the first part of the conversation.\nSame thing if my phone is mounted and/or charging and I want to place a speakerphone call - if I don't switch the audio before the other party answers, I'm left with an awkward hello...\nContext\nI'm normally using an iPhone XS with iOS 14 or an iPhone 7 with iOS 13. I don't want to switch the default device since there are many times I'd prefer to initiate the call normally, i.e. phone-to-ear.\n\nA: Before placing the call, you can open Control Center and tap the AirPlay icon to select a Bluetooth destination such as for example a pir of AirPods. The following call will then use that audio device by default.\nAfter the call is done, you'll probably to tap the AirPlay icon again to choose iPhone as your destination.\nIf you want to use wired headphones, you'll obviously need to actually connect them to the phone before they can be used.\nThere are no other settings or functionality for doing a once-only rerouting of phone-only audio to a specific device before placing a call.\nThere is however a different way to overcome the problem that the calls connects before you have managed to switch the audio destination: You can add a pause or wait to the actual phone number.\nI.e. when you edit a contact on your phone, you can set their phone number. If you click the button labelled \"+*#\" you get the option to place a pause or a wait. Add this to the start of the number, and you'll get additional time to switch the audio destination.\nA pause is literally just a pause for 2-3 seconds (afair), whereas wait means that the phone does not dial the rest of the number until you have tapped the phone to acknowledge.\n", "Q: iPad Pro stuck on iOS 13.7 Ive got a gen1 iPad Pro with iPadOS 13.7 on it.

I can't test it on your specific app and precise use case, but doing the above allowed me to create an AppleScript to successfully open multiple instances of another program with no errors.\nFrom reading your comments, I see that you might want the multiple instances of the program to reference different settings. Depending on your setup, you may still encounter problems with one instance over-writing changes to the settings made by the other instance.

I have a 16\" MBP and a external display with thunderbolt 3 capabilities. The display can charge devices with 85w, but the MBP needs 97ish. The question here is: is it bad for the battery to charge the computer and use it at the same time if you are consuming more energy that the charger could deliver?\n\nA: Charging the MacBook Pro with the lower wattage from the display is not bad for your battery health at all.\nThere's also nothing wrong with the computer consuming more energy than the charger delivers when under heavy use. It won't damage the battery nor the charger. Ofcourse it will eventually discharge the battery so that you need to lower the energy consumption in order to actually charge the battery.\nNote that a MacBook Pro does not usually use near 97 watts all the time when in use. It is usually in short bursts if at all.\n", "Q: How can I safely install applications which aren't distributed via the Mac App Store? To keep things simple, I'd like to only install apps from the official AppStore. But, I'm frequently finding that the apps that I need are not on the AppStore such as Gradle, Carbon Copy Cloner, and Android Studio. It is what it is, and I install them, but what's the deal?\nCan somebody explain to me why some applications are distributed outside of the store and how I as a user can still install them safely?\n\nA: There are some types of apps that are not allowed in the App Store but are still useful or actually needed to get a job done. The accepted answer lists some of the reasons. Sometimes, we app developers need access to certain APIs to provide the intended functionality, but Apple does not allow apps in the App Store which access those. As a specific example, my company provides a VPN client and we need to access low-level APIs to be able to make VPN connections. But access to these APIs is forbidden for apps in the App Store.\nApple has recognized that there are apps which simply cannot be distributed via the App Store, for various reasons, and has provided an alternative to ensure at least some safety for users: Developers can (and now sometimes must) notarize apps. For example, we must notarize when distributing Kernel Extensions or System Extensions. As a user, you actually need to actively disable System Integrity Protection to allow un-notarized apps with Kernel or System Extensions on macOS 10.15 Catalina and 11.0 Big Sur.\nWhat Notarization means is that we developers build an app, then pass it to Apple which scans it and if Apple thinks the app is free of malware, a \"ticket\" is saved with Apple that macOS can query. (Developers can then \"staple\" the ticket to the app so macOS doesn't need to query it via the Internet. It's cryptographically signed by Apple so you can't fake it.) The app is not reviewed like for the App Store, it's just an automated malware check and that's basically it.\nWhen you start such a notarized app, you get a dialog that warns you that the app was provided by a third-party developer, but also informs you that Apple has scanned it and deemed it safe for execution:\n\nWhen you see this dialog (wording may change, but will contain a phrase that Apple has checked it), it's reasonably safe for you as a user to start that third-party notarized app. The notarization ensures the app has not been tampered with (or else the cryptographic sign would break and macOS would refuse to start it). Apple vouches that it checked the app for \"malicious content\".\nThis does not guarantee that the app does not contain malicious content (developers can hide stuff from Apple if they really want to). Only that Apple wasn't able to find any. However, the notarization process allows Apple to retro-actively revoke a ticket if the app turned out to be malicious, thus preventing the app from running on your Mac. Apple was somewhat able to do so before with signed apps, but only by revoking the certificate of the developer, thus blocking all apps of said developer. Notarization allows Apple to block on a per-app-and-version level. So Apple is able to specifically block version 1.2.3 of Foo.app but allow version 1.2.4 to run.\n\nA: There can be many reasons for app developers to stay away from the App Store. For example:\n\n*\n\n*Wanting to avoid paying fees/percentages to Apple\n\n*App has functionality not possible in the App Store due to its sandboxing requirement or Apple's review guidelines\n\n*Not wanting to spend time on getting in the App Store (usually for programs that have been on the market long before the App Store was a thing)\n\nChecksums is definitely a very common way of validating downloaded files. Combined with a cryptographically secure certificate of authenticity for the checksum, and you can have a certain degree of trust in that the downloaded file originates from the app developer and is not tampered with by third parties.\n\nA: Sometimes there just isn’t a specific reason. A lot of software and developers have been around for decades and the AppStore isn’t really something that comes to mind as a high priority.\nGenerally things are on that store if:\n\n*\n\n*Developers want the UX\n\n*Developers need some of the functionality provided by the store\n\nIf those conditions don’t come in to play the work required to add it on a store doesn’t make sense if that work could also be used for new features, fixes or just going on vacation for a bit instead.\n\nA: If developers pay Apple $99 a year, they can cryptographically sign their applications, so that the OS will recognise their apps as being from trusted, identified developers.\nThe Security pane in System Preferences has a setting to allow apps from either the App Store only, or \"App Store and identified developers\". (There used to be a third option: \"Any\".)\nOn first launch, the app will be verified, and any 'modification' by malware should be picked up at this stage. Apple can revoke certificates from existing developers.\nIt should therefore be 'safe' to allow apps from identified developers to launch, even if not from the App Store.\nHowever, some developers may baulk at having to pay Apple just to write some code. Products that are multi-platform, particularly those that originate on Linux or generic Unix products (e.g. open-source software) may not see any point or benefit from using the App Store, and may even be philosophically opposed to it.\nNon-app software is also not eligible for the App Store, e.g. languages like Python, which is just an installed framework, accessed on the command line.\n", "Q: Up next widget GONE In iOS 13 there was an Up next widget, to show upcomming calendar appointments, reminders and alarms I think. This seems to be gone in iOS 14. I realize that there is a calendar widget, but that shows only calendar appointments. Reminders also comes with its own widget, but since it doesn't priotitize reminders that are due next it isn't all that useful. And even if, I would prefer to have it all in one place instead of having two widgets on the home screen.\nDid Apple remove the Up next widget? Or haven't I looked deep enough?\nIs there a way to communicate to Apple that I liked the Up next widget and that I would like to have it back?\n\nA: Apple removed that widget in iOS 14.\nThey introduced new options for the home screen and evidently felt that the popular widget was no longer necessary.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple via their Feedback form.\n", "Q: Alarm clock for iPhone/iPad which permits me to choose custom sound track without apple music, exists?

I'm trying to schedule a daily meeting, end the meeting, then open it back up each day. Its just a meeting where agents / friends can join to chat outside of the regular work meeting.\nThe main issue I have is that the computer I intend on automating this with, is my work computer on days I work, so any foreground tasks / scripts can get in the way.\nRight now, I'm just using AppleScript and SystemEvents to open Safari page, click a few things and then the meeting is opened. I am testing the simplest way to do this first, before I turn it into a scheduled task.\nSince I have to log into Webex, adding credentials in AppleScript would be nuts, so I'm stuck having to log in before starting the script, which pretty much defeats the purpose, since most days I'm not working and leave the computer and when I'm there, I start it up like normal anyway.\nI was thinking of maybe using my backup Android phone to just be plugged in all the time, and use some Root Macro app or if I can, a terminal script or something. Its all cracked and beat up so i dont vare about screen burn and all that.\nAny tips / advice? Webex Meetings does have a scheduler, but I dont think it actually starts the meeting\n\nA: Well scheduling a reoccurring meeting in WebEx is not a problem there's a checkbox for that and you can define Daily, Every weekday and duration.  You can also use Outlook to schedule the WebEx meetings.\n\nSounds more like you want to automatically launch the meeting instead of having the meeting saved with a reminder on a calendar app?\nIf you install the WebEx App on macOS and have it configured to start automatically there is a notifications setting so it pops up a reminder.  Then it's just a single click on Start Meeting. Or you can use the calendar of choice to do the same after importing an iCal Webex meeting.\nOr if you look at the scheduled meeting page and drop down the arrow on the green Start Meeting button there's an option to open with browser or the app.  If you choose to open with the app you can then inspect the page and find a long URL webexstart://launch/. Copy that code and then launch it with command line open \"webexstart://launch/..etc..etc..\".  That opens the App and brings you to the meeting where you still have to click Start Meeting. You could do the same with the meeting URL itself to launch the browser but that wouldn't be the webexstart:// but https:// instead. Similarly you'll need to click the Start Meeting button.\nSince WebEx can activate the microphone and camera its a security risk to just auto-connect and requiring at least some user input to make the connection is recommended. Password protecting meetings is highly recommended.\nHaving a Cisco compatible video conferencing hardware endpoint connected to a network, then you could as a WebEx engineer / admin configure it to start the meeting and connect automatically.  This is how physical conference rooms are setup. But then you need more privileges on the WebEx backend as well as some hardware infrastructure and the software to hook it into the Cisco WebEx backend. Also the latest best practice is to not auto-connect for security reasons and a physical conference room will typically have a touch panel showing the scheduled meetings and have a Join button that becomes available at the appropriate time. That way if no one shows up to that room the room won't automatically connect.  You don't want someone wandering by to eavesdrop on a meeting if no one is using that room.  For sensitive meetings it is normal to require a passcode even for a physical room so that means tapping Join and typing in a numeric passcode to join the meeting.\nAutomating your own connection is of course your own choice.  But consider the scenario of having your meeting auto-connect at an inappropriate moment, etc.\n", "Q: How to configure the category gridlines in Numbers? Below are two charts with and without gridlines. Obviously the one with gridlines isn't very useful. I would like to just have a gridline every 10 years or something like that. How do I do that?\n\n\n\nA: Both your plots have grids but the bottom one has too many.  You need to change the spacing by setting the number of grid lines.\nDouble click on the plot and in the right window click on axis at the top of that area. This opens a pane with Value X and Value Y labels near the top of the pane.  Below that you'll see Axis Scale which you can set to linear or logarithic. Right below that the pull down for linear or log there is a box that says Steps with major and minor underneth it.\nYou can enter a whole number in those two boxes and numbers will draw grid lines close to the number you entered.

The release of iOS 14 adds Widgets on the Home Screen to iOS.\nPeople have been using apps like Widgetsmith and Color Widgets to add customizable 3rd-party widgets and change the look of their entire iOS home screen.\nHowever, the question everyone's asking is how to remove the widget name text from under the widget (as that \"kills the vibe\").\n\nok but how do u remove the name widgetsmith from under its killing the vibe\n\nCan iOS 14 widgets be added to the iOS home screen without the app name / widget name underneath the widget? How can we hide the \"Widgetsmith\" label?\n\n\nA: In response to the question:\n\nIs there any possible way to remove the “Widgetsmith” title under the widget on the home screen? It ruins the vibe sometimes (twitter)\n\nDavid Smith, the creator of Widgetsmith, replied:\n\nUnfortunately not.  Apple requires that the app name be below every widget. (twitter)\n\nSo it appears that it is not currently possible to remove the name label text underneath an iOS home screen widget.\nThis is an iOS restriction, similar to all app icons (used to) have their app name under them. The widget app developers have no control over the matter, and cannot choose to hide their name.\nYou're gonna see the word \"Widgetsmith\" a lot:\n\nYou can send Product Feedback to Apple so that this is hopefully addressed in a future version of iOS.\n\nA: This is the MD Bank app. I tried it and it does work, but it’s far too limited.

Each author chooses the words they place when they publish, same as app developers code what they write into the code when they ship.\nBefore attempting to answer directly, in the past the user defaults were simple and wrote to one file.

Also, don’t overlook that the current preference system on macOS doesn’t necessarily persist any settings to a physical file. A developer can program that, but with iCloud and managed preferences, most apps skip that appendage as dead weight.  Again, unless dev document is generated when they ship the app, someone has to disassemble things to know implementation for each version of each app.\n", "Q: Ipad 10.2\" for a PhD: 32 or 128 GB? I hope this is the right community:\nI'm a first year PhD student in Mathematics, and I plan to buy an Ipad 10.2\" with the Apple Pencil as I have seen that it can be quite useful to take notes when I'm at the campus, and it's easily portable.\nMy main concern is about memory: I really don't know if I should take the 32GB or the 128GB.\nIn order to provide additional information: as a Mathematics student, I'm sure I will use intensively Notability or similar apps, and I think I will need to download PDFs with papers and stuff like that. For instance, if I plan to take notes using the Ipad, will I run out of memory with 32GB?\n\nA: As @benwiggy pointed out correctly, storage always tends to run short.\nOf course, such a topic is a matter of personal opinion. Trying to keep objective, please consider the following:\n\n*\n\n*The 32 GB option is the \"entry-level\" option—in fact, no other iPad even offers such a low option anymore! (iPad Air and iPad mini start at 64 GB; iPad Pro at 128 GB.) It is safe to assume that it's on the market solely as a cheap entry model to the Apple universe.\n\n*Getting the model with more storage will, even if you have no use for it now, increase the device's value down the line. I, for one, tend to sell my old Apple devices (usually after upgrading to a newer model): the resale value of a 32 GB devices will be considerably less than the same device with 128 GB.\n\n\nA: The answer to the question \"do I need more storage\" is always 'yes'. Parkinson's Law dictates that data expands to fill the space available.\nHowever, my \"PhD\" folder on my Mac is 1GB. This contains my thesis documents, with 230 vector illustrations; research notes; over 100 downloaded JSTOR papers and PDFs of other theses.\nI could add to that 12 GB of reference material as scanned images.\nBut of course, you'll need to factor in what form your data will be in, and all the apps you plan to add, and any other data that you might want to hold, such as the new pop music that the students like.\n\nA: As others have mentioned, this all depends on your use and needs. But to put this into perspective, this is a selection of my older iPad pro (I have used 103GB of 256GB):\n\n*\n\n*The operating system, iPadOS, will use about 10GB of storage.\n\n*A downloaded movie will use as much as 5GB\n\n*2500 notes in Evernote takes up 250MB (I suspect it's not storing\nthem all on iPad)\n\n*6 Books in Audible need 1GB\n\n*Spotify, with downloads, is 1GB\n\n*254 PDF and ePUB books uses 2.8GB\n\n*My music library is 14GB\n\nSo that's 12GB remaining if you don't have a music library, and if you do, then you can not store it on the iPad as you are out of space. Forget downloading a season of a Netflix show for the lonely hotel room.\nSo, even light use will consume 50% of your storage quickly. The nice thing about an iPad is how useful it is for watching movies, youtube/lectures and the like, especially when traveling.\nThe biggest challenge with 32GB is that it limits your use of the device, and the longevity of the device, should you wish to repurpose it, or if you find an app that will greatly aid in your research. As you can see, if you use the iPad exclusively for note and pdf/books, perhaps 32GB will suffice. But I would never recommend it.\nIn fact, if your intended use is note taking and books only, AND the difference in price is a burden, I would even recommend you consider a refurbished older model from the Apple Store with 128GB or higher, rather than a new one with 32GB.\nGood luck with your studies!\n", "Q: Unable to install Homebrew in Terminal I was trying to install Homebrew in Terminal.

I'd do the initial test & tweak stationary with engine off; again with engine on & re-balance, then drive a while & listen; park up & mod to suit the noise difference. Rinse & repeat until happy.\nWatch out for if your in-car has any kind of 'loudness' control, where bass is emphasised at lower volumes. these can be tricky to fight against work with…. and flatten any EQ curve already applied, at least to start with.\nI've never noticed any iPhone/Pod/Pad to be anything other than 'flat' or at least within decent tolerance so long as there's no EQ curve set by the user [& boy, have I seen some massive fails programmed in by users thinking they're 'improving' the sound]. It's usually the in-car that's the issue.\nFor a semi-related issue, see my answer on How to do speaker correction on a MacBook Pro Retina where I set out some dramatic curves to fix cheap computer speakers ;)\n\nA: You connect your iPhone to your Mac via a Lightning-to-USB(-C) Cable.\nThen, in the \"Audio MIDI Setup\" app (/Applications/Utilities folder), you enable the iPhone as an audio input.\n\nThe iPhone will then appear as an audio-in device in macOS and can be used as an input in any Core Audio-based audio app.\n\nFor playback of white or pink noise, you can use any iOS audio/video playback app. In YouTube, for instance, there are plenty of hour-long videos available with the respective noise audio tracks.\n", "Q: How to manually set time zone on iPhone while still automatically sync time? This is possible on basically all mainstream computer operating systems, like macOS, Windows 10, Ubuntu.\nFor example in macOS, I have these two settings (Set date and time automatically and Set time zone automatically using current location) separately. Similar settings exist in Windows 10 system settings, too.\nHowever, on iPhone, there is only one option that handles both, or at least it seems like how it works, which is called \"Set Automatically\".\nBasically, I want my time to be synced automatically so it is accurate as possible. At the same time, I want to be able to manually configure it to a time zone that is NOT on my current location. There might be a lot of situations where this is useful and it is possible on all computer/laptop operating systems.\nIf there is no solution to this due to iOS system settings limitation, is there any workaround? E.g. using some other way or even app to sync time automatically or on-need? One ugly workaround that might work is to manually toggle the above setting on and off again. iOS remembers the manual time zone setup when I do this, so it is not terribly complex. However, I still want to see if there is a more elegant way to achieve it, like in the computer systems.\nPS: Turning location service off for \"System Services / Setting Time Zone\" does NOT work. The phone still gets local time zone when the above option is turned on. I do not know how it works -- maybe it gets time zone info from my carrier or using my IP address, etc.\n\n\n\n\nA: I have the workaround for that:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Go to privacy\n\n*Go to location services\n\n*Scroll down\n\n*Go to system services\n\n*Find the option named as \"setting time zone\"\n\n*Toggle it off\n\nNow when you will change time zone and then click set automatically, it will not change your time zone and time will sync\n\nIt works on my iPad but I am not sure about iPhone..\n", "Q: Is Spatial Audio used while listening to music on AirPods Pro?

I have noticed that sometimes switching to a new tab takes several minutes, during which Terminal appears to hang with a busy cursor.\nI suspect that cause is running programs in that tab with very verbose debug output, that is producing extremely long lines.  I know that sometimes there are single lines with megabytes of text in them, and it's possible that the lines have tens or hundreds of megabytes.\nOne solution to the problem is to run those commands as command_with_long_output | cut -c 1-1000, but I have a tendency to forget to do that, especially if I'm switching from running a test data set (where the lines are maybe a few kilobytes) to running the full data set.\nI'm hoping for a setting of \"Only keep 1M of data\" or \"Only keep first 20k characters per line\", but I don't see anything like that.\n\nA: Go to Terminal / Preferences / Profiles / Window / Scrollback / Limit the number of rows to:\n\n", "Q: Automatically accept Screen Sharing invitations? I use Messages' Ask to Share Screen feature all the time to remotely debug problems on my contacts' Macs.\nIt's a very easy way to initiate a Screen Sharing session, does not require port forwarding, and does not require a local network / works over the internet: Does screen sharing work when not on the same local network?\n\nMessages > select a Conversation > Details > Screen Sharing button > Ask to Share Screen\n\nThis generates a notification on the remote Mac, asking for permission: \"NAME would like to view your screen\".\n\nAnd until that notification is accepted, your Mac will be \"Waiting for response from NAME\".\n\nThis works fine, and is secure, when you are remotely helping a contact who is in front of their Mac. They can decide to share their screen, and accept/decline your request.\nBut I would like to use the same mechanism to control my own Macs remotely. No one is sitting in front of the screen to press \"Accept\", so it will never connect.\nHow can I initiate Screen Sharing remotely via Apple ID?\n\n*\n\n*Is there any \"official\" way to Screen Share across networks with two Macs that are using the same Apple ID?\n\n*\n\n*Apple Remote Desktop costs $80 and probably has more features than I need.\n\n*Back to My Mac may have provided this functionality, but was disabled in 2019.\n\n\n\n*Can the above notification be scripted via Apple Script or similar to automatically accept Screen Sharing requests?\n\n*If I am able to script an automatic accept, can such Screen Sharing requests be limited by Apple ID? What other security measures should be considered?\n\n\nA: You can get permissionless access using VNC protocol from another Mac. I've enabled this for our home iMac and my son's MacBook both to do remote management and to quickly check that he's on task or help him with access issues during remote learning days. It does require that you have the target computer's IP address and that port forwarding is enabled if you are attempting to access remotely rather than on the same network. (In my case, the iMac can be accessed remotely, but I don't port forward for my son's computer, so I can only access it when I am at home.)\nIn preferences (General -> Sharing -> Screen Sharing), make sure the specific local user account you want to use to connect is added to screen sharing. Ensure \"Anyone may request permission to control screen\" is enabled in Computer Settings. Connect from Finder (Go -> Connect to Server -> enter vnc://[target computer IP]:5900). If this is an access you will use repeatedly, click the + button at bottom of popup window to save it to your list for convenience.\nWhen login prompt appears, enter the local user name and password you enabled under Sharing. The local user will get a notice (at least under macOS Ventura) that the computer is being controlled remotely; they will have the option to disconnect you. But no permission response is required, at least in my testing. Users not explicitly included in Screen Sharing access will likely still require permission prior to allowing you to connect.\nIf logging in using an admin account, and a different user is logged on, you may be asked whether you want to log on as the user you entered when connecting, or share the screen of the currently logged in user. If you select the latter, again, permission will likely be required.\nIt's a bit muddled as more recent macOS versions have made this slightly more difficult to initially set up, in the name of privacy, but once you have gotten it to work (and saved the connection) you should be good in future. Worst case scenario, you'd have to determine whether the $80 Apple Remote Desktop program is worth it to you for your intended use case.\n", "Q: Other Mac storage taking up 90GB! Help! I currently have other storage around 90GB on a 120GB internal drive so pretty much all of it. I have optimised to iCloud and deleted all large extra files and documents etc. However, on the omnidisksweeper it is showing there is 20gb just in updates and 13gb on system but I am unsure what I can delete. Any help will be appreciated!\n\nA: I woudn't be concerned too much with those two since they are only 33 gigs total. The 90 GB space should be of more concern. I suggest you get Daisy Disk or Grand Perspective to give you a color graphical mapping of your disk drive. These color maps make it easy to see what is hogging your disk drive. Daisey Disk, if obtained from developers site has a free trial.  Grand Perspective is free.\nI'm not familar with omnidisksweeper.\n\nA: If you have Updates pending, then installing them should remove the packages.\n13Gb for the system is to be expected - don't delete anything from there!\nCheck for iPhone/iPad backups, which get stored in your user Library.

I am having trouble getting Mac OS 9.2.2 installed on my PowerBook G4 Titanium (867mhz).\nI am knowledgeable with Windows and Linux but I have no experience on how to setup these older Macs. They seem to have a lot of disparate drivers that are very specific and shipped on install discs with those machines only. This is very foreign to me as I'm used to genetic OS disk/discs and then installing a selection of compatible drivers.\nI downloaded this:\n\nDownload #4: Mac OS 9.2.2 system folders extracted from the PowerBook G4 Titanium (DVI) A1025 (867MHz/1.0GHz) Software Install and Restore DVD. Unstuffed, this should result in a bootable OS 9 toast image.\n\nhttps://macintoshgarden.org/apps/mac-os-922-system-folders\nWhich I extracted from the .sit file using Stuffit Expander on a newer Mac running OSX. I then mounted the .toast file and copied the files by dragging them onto a disk newly formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nI installed the disk I to the PowerBook and achieved only a partial success. I get a little face in a folded that blinks to a question mark. The folder has the appearance of OS 9 but does not boot.\n\n\nSimply formatting a disk and then copying files to it is really strange to me. I'm used to having to setup boot partitions or some kind of a bootloader. But from what I've read you just drag and drop the files?\nHere are the files as they appear on the disk. Are the folder names right?\n\n\nA: Mac OS Extended (Journaled) is an OSX extension to the older HFS+ file system. While it can be read by OS9, the journal block will be ignored. OS9 needs a HFS+ file system without journaling. Also, unstuffing on an OSX file system will not add the resource fork which is essential for OS9. The blinking folder with the question mark tells you that while the file system can be read, no bootable operating system is present.\nThe original Mac OS held data in two forks, the data fork and the resource fork. That was a clever way of preserving precious disk space because many UI elements could be shared by all programs and read from the operating system files. ResEdit should be included in your OS9 installation and can be used to study and change resource forks once you get the system up and running.\nDragging files on OSX dives will not produce a bootable disk. Better try to burn a DVD directly from the .toast file because this will also copy files that OSX will ignore. Then boot from that DVD and do all file copying from within that OS9 system because only then will the resource files be copied as well.\n\nA: You may need an appropriate version of MacOS 9. There are modified versions for some later G4 models on MacOS9Lives.com -- for instance here:\nhttp://macos9lives.com/smforum/index.php/topic,4366.0.html\nMore info here:\nhttp://mac-classic.com/articles/mac-os-9-on-unsupported-systems/\n", "Q: If I make a bootable pendrive running macOS, will downloaded apps and data persist on each boot? Sorry if this seems like a basic question, but I couldn't find a clear statement on this anywhere: I wish to make a bootable pendrive running macOS Mojave, so that I can run some 32-bit apps. So I want whatever apps and data I download to persist on the pendrive, on each boot. Is this the case by default, when I use the createinstallmedia command on Terminal, as suggested in Apple Support, to create the bootable drive?\n\nA: The createinstallmedia command creates a startup disk whose purpose is installing MacOS onto another drive.\nIf you just want to install MacOS onto a USB thumb drive, then just run the OS installer app and select the drive as the target. (It will present you with the current system volume by default, but there's an \"Other Volumes\" button.)\nOnce you've installed the OS onto your USB drive, yes, it will be a read-write volume, so things will get saved there and stay there. (Though remember to keep a backup as thumb drives can fail suddenly.)\nAn alternative strategy might be to host Mojave inside a Virtual Machine (VM), which is \"an OS as an app\". So you launch the VM and Mojave runs in a window, inside your Catalina (or later) OS! Parallels or VirtualBox are the two main VMs.\n\nA: The direct answer to your question is… yes. if you boot into a full macOS from any drive, it will behave in exactly the same way; all prefs, files, updates, documents etc will be kept, exactly the same way as it would from your regular internal boot drive.\nHowever - and this is a big however…\nrunning macOS from a USB stick will be so stunningly slow that you'll wonder if it's hung. Not only will it be slow, but it is so likely to glitch & fail without warning that it is absolutely not recommended.\nIf instead you use an external SSD over USB-3, then you will have a viable system, running at speeds comparable to a regular internal drive.\nAlso note: createinstallmedia  creates a bootable installer, from which to install a full OS. You cannot use it directly to run macOS.\n", "Q: How to enter Unicode (or other) symbols in LaTeX within Keynote (iWork) In Keynote and other iWork apps, it is possible to enter formulas (and text) in LaTeX. This is an immensely valuable feature. But...\n\n*\n\n*How can I enter an astronomical (or other) symbol, via Unicode or by other means, directly in a LaTeX formula (ie. without copying and pasting from the Character Viewer — which doesn’t work anyway directly in the LaTeX formula editor within Keynote)?\n\n*\n\n*For example, I wish to get the Mars symbol ♂ or the Venus symbol ♀ by entering \\mars or \\venus.\n\n\n\nThis Apple page claims that one can also enter (ASCII) Unicode characters, but no indication is given there, in the blahtex documentation, or anywhere else about how to enter a Unicode character.\nI’d also be happy with any non-Unicode route that allows me to enter such characters directly within the LaTeX coding within Keynote. Any approach by which I could use any of the astronomical symbols in the LaTeX Comprehensive Symbol List would be a dream.\n\nA: Thanks to the tip from tom-gewecke, I have a functioning workaround.\n\n*\n\n*First, you have to enable the Unicode Hex Input keyboard in your System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources.\n\n*Then, of course, you activate it, for example, by ticking Show Input menu in menu bar, then selecting Unicode Hex Input with your cursor in the menu bar.\n\n*Once this keyboard is enabled, you can enter Unicode characters by holding down the Alt/Option key ⌥ on your keyboard and, while holding it down, typing the code for the Unicode character.\n\n*You can find code for Unicode characters by, for example, from the same keyboard menu bar item, selecting Show Emoji & Symbols, which opens the Character Viewer.\n\nThat much was known. The workaround to get a Unicode character directly into a LaTeX formula with an iWork application (eg. Keynote, Pages) is:\n\n*\n\n*Once you open the editor for equations ( Insert > Equation... or ⌥⌘E ) to enter LaTeX code, you type \\text{ }, and when your cursor is between those brackets in the text field, you type the code for the Unicode character as described above.\n\n*Et voila, you have any Unicode character directly in your formula.

I logged out of my Macbook (pro 2019, Catalina) then after mistyping my password, accidentally hit the “recover password” button (or something along those lines, can’t remember). I do remember my password, so that’s not the issue.\nMy Macbook then rebooted and took me to a black screen with a grey lock and a password prompt (which I learned was the firmware password page). I don’t remember ever setting a firmware password.\nI tried my regular login password, which didn’t work. I also tried any other password I could think of. None worked. I tried booting into recovery mode with command+r, but I still get the same screen.\nI think the issue could be that my Macbook is trying to boot into recovery mode (because I accidentally clicked to recover my password), but recovery mode requires the firmware password. And now I can’t get it to boot normally, without recovery mode. I tried following these steps, but I always get the lockscreen.\nIs there a way to go back to how it was before, with the normal login screen (with my known password)?\n\nA: As you have already attempted the known ways of changing startup disk, it seems that the firmware password is necessary in order to proceed. However, there's no publically known way of bypassing the firmware password.\nYou can however take the device to an Apple Store along with proof of ownership, and they will unlock the firmware password for you. If you do not live near an Apple Store, call Apple and they can probably arrange mail-in repair or similar.\nIf it is a company device and you haven't got proof of ownership, you'll need to go through your employer. Most probably they will know the firmware password, and can proceed without having to contact Apple.\nIn some cases, managed devices (i.e. company issued laptops) can be set to require special access in order to do things that could circumvent managed device restrictions - such as for example trying to boot from a different partition. This could quite possibly be what you have run into. In this case you'll need to contact your employer to get it fixed.\n", "Q: Can’t restore MacOS from recovery I messed up my Macbook pro 16 inches in the following way:\n\n*\n\n*it came installed with Catalina\n\n*I upgraded to Big Sur Beta\n\n*Wanted a fresh install, tried to reinstall from recovery but didn’t install fresh OS\n\n*Went to recovery and deleted all volumes\n\n*Created one APFS volume\n\n*Went to internet recovery, tried to install Catalina, it gives me \"Downloading installer information to the target volume failed\" (tried multiple networks/hotspot with google dns, but same)\n\nWhat can I do to un-mess this situation ?\nEdit: downloaded Catalina dmg and restored it to flash disk, booted into recovery but says security settings do not allow booting from external devices, when I try to change the settings it tells me no administrator account found to log in !\n\nA: This is pretty easy if you have a network that works or a second Mac.\nI’m not sure you have either based on the initial version of your question. You may have both based on the edit.\nThe erase install process works great for us on the hardware you have. I wouldn't mess with bootable media if you can download from Internet Recovery.\nInstead - erase the disk, which returns you to the Catalina installer.

For example, just one minute of use\n\nresults in 37% of battery use\n\nand I need to recharge 2-4 times (iPhone XS) to get through a day, rendering my phone pretty much useless.\nWhat causes this and how do I fix it. Is it another bug with iOS 14?\n\nA: If you have a welltory app or other third party integration, check it’s not stuck in a loop.\nPast that, here are some general ideas.\nConsider ruling out a temporary backlog of data processing if you updated iOS  in the last 36 hours. If for some reason you think it’s stuck or taking too long, one force quit of the device and then a normal restart and observe things for 24 hours worked for me.  Also, be sure any app writing data or reading data are disabled / up to date. Health could just be the abusee if other apps are poking it too much or wrongly.\nYou can also always back up and restore if you think your device needs that.\nI do not do this lightly, but there are cases when the saved application state for things like Photo processing, health app processing and others can get stuck.\n\n*\n\n*Back up your device - you need to be ready to erase and reinstall, so be sure you have a solid backup or save important app data to the cloud and verify it.\n\n*One time - power down the phone cleanly. (Slide to power off)\n\n*Verify that the issue of high battery usage continues. Consider deleting other apps that interact with health / photos (you have a backup - this is a short term deletion).\n\n*Then force power off the device - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201412 - this discards all saved application state.\n\n*The device will start all the processes again - expect high CPU / high heat, high battery drain until the processes complete.\n\n*If you can’t wait any longer - erase the device entirely and do not restore the backup.\n\nNow - be sure the energy is low / the OS is good, and it idles properly - now do the erase / restore to get your apps and data back. Also, be sure to get any updates - X.0 releases are tested very well, but often without lots of live data - so it’s almost always the data we bring to the update that reveals bugs - not that an empty phone on X.0 release is buggy.\nThe only solution is to not update the first 2 weeks of a new release and let others find / report / triage / isolate these situations.\n", "Q: Why does extracting a large file with MacZip cause Mac OS 9 to hang? Why is it that I can perform multitasking when extracting .sit files with StuffIt Expander but extracting .zip files with MacZip causes Mac OS 9 to hang until extraction is complete?\n\nA: In modern MacOS, the multi-tasking is controlled by the OS itself. It 'deals' out CPU cycles to the running processes.\nClassic MacOS 9 used 'Cooperative multitasking', in which applications took turns on the CPU, and released control when they finished.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking\n'Good' applications would provide code to ensure that they didn't hold on more than they needed.\n", "Q: Is a SSD with the following First Aid report salvageable?

I have already deleted hundreds of photos in iCloud, and this works fine on my iPhone and Macbook.\nHowever, I also have an IMac which WAS synced to the other machines up till 2017. This means in Photo it  has all the photos I ever took up to 2017 including the hundreds that I have carefully deleted from iCloud.\nI want to set it so it syncs to iCloud again. But if I do, will the deleted photos get added back into my Photos from this IMac? So wasting the many hours of filleting.\nIs there any risk of this? Is there anything I can do?\nShould I actually delete all the photos from the IMac before syncing? Would this run the risk of deleting them all from iCloud once I sync (I would not want to risk that!).\nI have checked other questions but this seems to be new.  My question is the opposite of many others I see, when people cannot get deleted photos to sync to another device.\nIts an old iMac using OS X Yosemite 10.10.5\nThanks for advice.\n\nA: There’s no risk if you have a backup. Cloud syncs, just like RAID are not backups.\nI’ve had very good experience with Apple tracking when I delete files from a fully health sync setup. Adding a new device to sync generally wants to combine all.\nAlso - look at a tool that can easily clean duplicates if you run into this situation often.\n\n*\n\n*https://fatcatsoftware.com/powerphotos/\nIf you want to be safe, set up a new photo library or export all the photos before you start.

I tried to run the exact same cronjobs I ran on Ubuntu before, however they don't, and after trying to figure out if the crontab entries might have any errors, I more and more had the suspicion that cronjobs don't run on my MBP at all, so I added this line to crontab -e:\n*/15 * * * * touch /Users/<my-user>/cronjob-success-\"$(date +%Y%m%d)\".txt\nI'd expect it to run every 15 min (xxh15, xxh30, ...), however no new files appear.

(If you need more information, please let me know to update this post.)\n\n\nThank you so much for your time <3\nPS: Sorry for my English. It isn't my mother language.\n\nA: Only the first disk shown in your pictures, (internal), is \"real\". (synthesized) is how your Mac will see the real drive once it's complete, but you can ignore this one for now. All the others (disk image) are made by Internet Recovery as temporary structures, part of your recovery install & will vanish once you are booted normally.\nWhat looks to have happened is you have formatted your internal drive, but not added a volume, only the APFS container.\nThe 'quick fix' would seem to be to format it again from Disk Utility. Set the View menu to 'Show all devices' first, then select your actual physical drive, not anything within it [you will see devices & their contents as a set of hierarchical folders in this View, so choose the top level] & use the 'Erase' function.\nChoose GUID/APFS.\nIt should then make a new EFI and a new Container Disk, containing one Volume, named as you set in the previous dialog.

I assume this was symptom of general network problem, so I rebooted my Mac and confirmed that it wasn’t able to connect to any web sites via web browsers or any apps.\nThe macOS network utilities (in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications) worked fine, but command line apps like traceroute fail with no useful diagnostics or error messages. Neither WiFi nor wired connection work, though other devices on the network were fine. I rebooted all my network hardware, checked for firmware updates, ran Mac hardware diagnostics (by rebooting while holding down the d key), etc., and the problem persists with no promising leads. The only glimmer of hope is that when I use tethered connection via my iPhone, that works (!).\nWhat is going on?\n\nA: After of literal hours of debugging, I discovered that Charles Proxy was not symptom of a broader problem, but rather it was the problem (even though I rebooted several times and Charles was no longer running).\nAfter hours of debugging, I spent a little time mentally backtracking and thinking about when the problem first manifested itself, and remembered Charles. So, I decided to fire up Charles and the network was suddenly restored. And when I quit Charles gracefully, it restored everything to a stable state. Lol.\nClearly, when it froze on me, it left my networking configuration in some internally inconsistent state. But restarting Charles and quitting it gracefully allowed it to restore my computer to an operable state again.\nThat’s six hours of my life that I’ll never get back. I write this post to hopefully save someone the pain and anguish I just went through.\n(FWIW, this is not a criticism of Charles. It’s an invaluable tool, like WireShark, for debugging networking code. I love Charles, but I guess one needs to be careful if it ever freezes on you. This was the first time it has locked up on me in my many years of using it, so it’s clearly a fairly isolated problem. In retrospect, the solution seems obvious, but, OMG, what a painful learning experience.)\n", "Q: Duplicating and renaming images using script I need to duplicate and rename an image using a list of SKU codes from a spreadsheet as the unique name for each image. I have used the script from this answer Automate Duplicating and Renaming Images. I removed the filename line and changed \"$line-$filename\" to \"$line\". It works almost as expected but adds a ? to the end of every file, so it isn't saving as a .png, rather it saves as a .png?.\nHow do I get rid of the question mark...is there a simple fix to the script below or is it an issue with the txt file of SKU codes? Is it an encoding issue? Thank you so much.\n    #!/bin/bash\n    file=$1\n    prefixes=$2\n    while read line\n    do\n      cp $file \"$line\"\n    done < $prefixes\n\n\nA: Your txt file probably has DOS/Windows-style line endings, which have a carriage return character at the end of each line (in addition to the linefeed that unix-style text files have). Unix tools generally mistake the carriage return for part of the line's content, and I suspect that's the extra character getting added to the filenames. You can check with file prefixfile.txt (or whatever the filename is); if it says something about \"CRLF line terminators\", this is the problem.\nIf that is the problem, you can have the read command strip the extra character with:\n...\nwhile IFS=$IFS$'\\r' read -r line\ndo\n    ...\n\nExplanation: The read command will trim whitespace at the beginning and end of lines. Whitespace is defined by the contents of the IFS variable. Using IFS=$IFS$'\\r' adds carriage return to the list of whitespace characters, so read will trim it.\nMessing with IFS is generally a bad idea, since it can have weird effects, but in this case the assignment is a prefix to the read command, so it only affects that one command. This makes it much safer.\n", "Q: Can I create OneNote links that open in the desktop app instead of the web app?

A few weeks ago, as I was editing the spreadsheet on my Mac, Numbers told me that it couldn't connect to iCloud, and any changes I make won't be shared. I figured it was a temporary issue and would fix itself.\nLast week the issue still wasn't fixed. When I open the spreadsheet on my iPad, everything is fine - it connects to iCloud and changes are uploaded. I tried creating a new spreadsheet and sharing it with my wife (I chose Messages as the sharing option), but after pressing the Share button, Numbers displays an error: \"Sorry, your invitation couldn't be sent.\" If I use the \"Copy Link\" option, it also displays an error (\"Sorry, people couldn't be added.\"). It works fine to share a spreadsheet from my iPad.\nI thought maybe creating a new spreadsheet and sharing it from my iPad would fix the problems, but on my Mac Numbers still can't connect to iCloud.\nDuring this time, any spreadsheets that aren't shared work fine - I can edit them on my Mac, and the changes show up on my iPad.\nRebooting my Mac hasn't helped.\nToday I tried logging out of iCloud on my Mac and logging back in, but the problem persists.\nDo you have any ideas how to fix this? I'm sure if I did a clean install that would fix this, but I'd like to avoid that if at all possible.\n\nA: Collaboration is no longer possible if you are still using macOS 10 Catalina; I just ran into this problem, which might be the same as yours. An update to at least macOS 11 Big Sur is required to collaborate on a document shared via iCloud:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206181\nAs mentioned, you can still use the web app at icloud.com.\n\nA: The easiest way to fix this is to use the web app. (To triage and also buy time to sort out the failure)\nBoth you and your collaborator should sign in to https://www.icloud.com/numbers\nThis way, there can’t be any issues with local passwords, local version issues, account problems. Once you’re signed in to the servers at Apple data centers, you can open up your document and be sure the sharing is saved and live online.\nThen track back one by one to isolate an issue on a specific device or specific local version of numbers.\nOnce you confirm the issue is the local user account you may need to remove your account and start over to test things further. It’s less likely a system issue, but erase install everything can sometimes work without needing to remove the iCloud keys from the keychain and re-establish identity on that Mac user account.\nAppleCare might have insight if they can read the precise error message on server side and compare with your account error.\n", "Q: Remove Mac OS X from disk without erasing it I have many hard drives on my Mac.

This is the most secure method because encryption is end-to-end. In addition to whatever other encryption goes on, the end points of the chain encrypt and decrypt each other's traffic. So the traffic passing through the intermediate hosts is always encrypted. But this method cannot be used if the intermediate hosts deny port forwarding.\n\nSee also Khris Tolbert's Proxyjump, the SSH option you probably never heard of\n", "Q: How do I prevent spam from appearing in Messages on iOS?

Years ago I set the Reply-To header as my A account address (I think to force use of my 'canonical' address), since then I added my B account. Now all of my outgoing e-mail has the Reply-To header set to my A address. This causes considerable confusion to observant correspondents e-mailed through my B account. So, I'd like to fix this.\nHere's where the mystery begins. I don't remember how I set the default Reply-To header. I would have thought that I would have used:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders ...\nHowever\ndefaults read com.apple.mail UserHeaders\ntells me \"The domain/default pair of (com.apple.mail, UserHeaders) does not exist.\"\nNext, I looked at the configuration on our e-mail provider, FastMail, to see if they might be setting a default Reply-To header. but I didn't see anything there.\nThen, I tried resetting Apple Mail back to its default state using the instructions in How to reset mail to factory settings on discussions.apple.com. No dice.\nAnd then, the method in How to Fix Mail App Not Working After macOS Update. Strike four.\nManually setting the header when I'm writing an e-mail doesn't work. The value I set gets overwritten, by the value for account A.\nWhere else could the header be set?\n\nA: So with a bit of help the problem was tracked down to an interaction between SIP (System Integrity Protection), terminal, and Apple Mail.\nHere's what was going on:\n\n*\n\n*Due to SIP the Terminal app did not have access to Mail's defaults file: ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist\n\n*As a result, the defaults program was unable to read the defaults settings that Mail.app was actually using.\n\n*Instead of reporting an error when trying to access the com.apple.mail.plist it reported that the \"The domain/default pair of (com.apple.mail, UserHeaders) does not exist.\"\n\nThe big clue was that defaults read com.apple.mail returned nothing.\nThe fix was to allow the Terminal.app full disk access in System Preferences (in Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access). Then you restart Terminal.app.\nAfter that defaults works as expected and\ndefaults delete com.apple.mail User-Headers\nsolved the problem – since I didn't have any other User-Headers set.\n", "Q: Automator script to click button on web page generates “The operation couldn’t be completed.\" error The AppleScript below is supposed to click the first element with the magnifier class on a predefined web page.\nThe script runs successfully if you comment out the JavaScript line, do JavaScript \"document.getElementsByClassName('magnifier')[0].click();\"\nFrom the Chrome console, this line of JavaScript executes successfully.\nBut if you include the JavaScript line, the following error occurs:\n\nThe action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error: “The operation\ncouldn’t be completed.

I have a PowerBook G4 Titanium that I need to wipe to clear the previous user's personal data. It has a password that I don't know but I can still login automatically to OS X upon boot. Not having the administrative password is preventing me from wiping the computer through the options provided by the OS.\nI have learned that these older macs come with specific roms and extensions for the older OSs and I would like to back these up. But I understand that this isn't entirely straightforward due to aliasing and resource forks. The OS 9 part of the laptop was never used so it is pristine and a good candidate for being backed up.\nHow do I do go about backing up all of the necessary files in a way that I can restore them?\nI selected the following files on the root partition and dropped then all at once into DropStuff:\n\n*\n\n*Applications (Mac OS 9)/\n\n*Desktop (Mac OS 9)/ -> Desktop Folder/\n\n*Desktop Folder/\n\n*Desktop DB\n\n*Desktop DF\n\n*System Folder/\n\n*Trash/\n\nIs this sufficient to preserve aliases and resources or do I need to do this differently?\nI know very little about vintage Mac software and filesystems but I am very experienced with both Windows and Linux.

Can it then drive two extended displays from one port?\nIf it matters the MacBook in question is the a MacBook pro 16-inch, 2019 with AMD Radeon Pro.\n\nA: I think you've confused Thunderbolt and USB-C.\nThe problems with these \"display splitters\" that work as \"ABC\" in Windows and \"ABB\" in Mac is that they're USB-C cables.

I'd like to automate that process.  Is there some way to interact with the Catalina permissions via the command line (via sudo of course)?\n\nA: The short answer is no - these are designed by Apple to be user granted, at the last moment, when you decide you wish to cede control to an app as opposed to pre-cleared and scripted. The better fix is to sort out why that App keeps changing or your OS is dropping the entitlements - you should be able to set it once.\nIt’s pretty easy to read the database to see what settings have been configured, not designed to change the settings directly via shell. (If you find a way, it might be worth $$ to report that to Apple - https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/)\nA longer answer is, kind-of - if you have MDM, and set up a framework, supervise the device (or opt in to the MDM automating these settings) and then craft configuration profiles that once signed and trusted, can be installed by script.\nTo get started on this takes quite a bit of time.

And you also can get extra USB sharing ports at the same time.\nJust carefully to select the right DisplayPort-to-Type-C active converter for the connection between the KVM switch video out to the Type-C monitor.\nWe tested and recommended CAC-1557 for the cable  and UDP-12AP for the KVM switch.\n", "Q: Why is News.app greyed out in the Finder?

Is there no workaround?\n\nA: Question:\n\nMy question: Do all of my bash and python scripts need to be housed in /Users/myusername path always? Is there no workaround?\n\nAnswer:\nNo. You can locate your bash and python scripts anywhere you like. However, there are additional requirements:\n\n*\n\n*Your cron jobs run with a different ENVIRONMENT than when you run them; e.g. $PATH. Consequently, you should use a full path specification for specifying your scripts in the crontab; for example use:\n\n* * * * * /opt/local/bin/python3 /some/dir/you/choose/myscript.py\n\n\n\n*On my Mac (Catalina) I've found it necessary to give \"Full Disk Access\" privileges to cron. YMMV on a different OS version. Here's how:\n\nSystem Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy tab:\n\n\n\n*At least while debugging your cron job, you should consider redirecting any error messages (stderr) to a file - otherwise they wind up in /dev/null which is not helpful! Continuing with the above example:\n\n* * * * * /opt/local/bin/python3 /some/dir/you/choose/myscript.py >> /Home/<username>/MyCronLog.txt 2>&1\n\n\nA: You may just need to be sure you grant permissions to the elements and use full paths for everything.

(Siri has a “Type to Siri” option, but Voice Control does not).  Is there really no accessibility option for letting the user type the text of the button they want to click?\nWhat I’ve tried: I tried Switch Control, but it scans for links instead of letting you jump to ones matching a given text.  I’ve also tried Cmd+F in Safari to highlight links, but nothing I’ve found lets me click the highlighted link without using the mouse.  I’ve been using Mouse Keys to navigate instead, albeit slowly.\n\nA: In Safari you can use ⌥ Option⇨Tab to move through clickable controls/links on a webpage. Use ⇧ Shift⌥ Option⇨Tab move backward through the page. Then use the ⏎ Return key to open the link. You can make it a bit easier by turning on \"Press tab to highlight each item on a webpage\" in Safari → Preferences → Advanced. That will remove the need to use the ⌥ Option key, so just use ⇨Tab and ⇧ Shift⇨Tab.\n", "Q: Desktop icon for mounted NAS volume changes location and it annoys me Question relates to the desktop icon for a mounted networked drive.\nMacOS 10.14.6 - Seagate NAS SMB - Computer stays on and is set to never sleep.

Having commenced Recovery mode twice with new OS I am seeing Four drives.  One is the 1Tb SSD but the main primary drive is showing as iMac (121.12Gb) plus another two named as iMac2-Data and iMac2-Dat-Dat.  How to have just two drives, SSD plus primary drive?\nHere is terminal screen image.\n\n\nA: First: it is normal with APFS to list the internal physical drives, followed by 'synthesized' volumes. So you should expect to see /dev/disk0 to 3.\nCatalina uses two separate volumes for a system disk: iMac2 is the read-only volume for your OS, and iMac2 - Data is for your apps, user data and everything else.\nHowever, from the looks of it, iMac2 is too small to hold an OS. It looks like you've installed the OS onto iMac2 - Data, and the OS has created a matching  'Data' partition called iMac2 - Data - Data.\nI'd suggest erasing the entire device - you may need to check \"Show All Devices\" in the View menu in Disk Utility - and then install from scratch.\n", "Q: Safari won’t load, it freezes shortly after I open it and the coloured wheel appears I have been having problems with the Safari on my MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018) in the last couple of days. I updated it yesterday to Catalina 10.15.7 and I have Safari Version 14.0.\nNow every time I open safari, I get to the favourites page and when I click on a website (like moodle, or websites from my school) it always freezes and the coloured wheel starts spinning and the fans start turning really loudly. I can’t close the browser, and I have to “quit” Safari, but that doesn’t work, so I have to “force quit” it. And when I restart Safari the same thing happens again, so I tried to force-restart my laptop, because Safari is frozen. But when I restart it the same thing happens again. And I just have 1 website/tab/window open, and it used to work fine in the past.\nI closed all the other apps, and tried reopening Safari multiple times. And then I tried restarting my mac several times.\nI tried to run diagnostics on my laptop and that said there were no problems.\nI deleted all my Safari History and I emptied my Caches.\nI do not have any extensions.\nI usually can’t even log into my university-moodle-account, and when I can, I can’t download any of my homework or watch the video-recordings of the lectures.\nI don’t know how to fix it.\n\nA: Most issues with web browsers in general, including Safari, can be traced back to just a few things:\n\n*\n\n*Damaged/Corrupt cache\n\n*Damaged/corrupt settings file(s)\n\n*Damaged/misbehaving add-on/extension\n\nThe first thing I would do is close all your tabs then go to the \"Safari\" menu and select \"Clear history...\" Change the pop-up menu  to clear \"all history\" and click the Clear history button. Once that is done quit and re-launch Safari.\nIf this didn't solve your problem, try starting Safari in Safe Mode. Hold the Shift key while launching Safari. This disables all extensions.\nIf that solved the problem you can launch Safari normally, go to Safari > Preferences... > Extensions and turn all but one off. And see how Safari behaves. It is then a process of elimination of turning extensions on/off to find the culprit. Note that some extensions may interfere with another extension so it may be a combination of 2 or more extensions that are causing the problem.\nThat didn't do it? OK let's delete some settings/preferences files.\n\n*\n\n*Quit out of safari\n\n*In Finder select the Go menu and if \"Library\" is not available select Go to folder and enter ~/Library and press enter.\n\n*A finder window will open, scroll down till you see Preferences. And look for files that start with com.apple.safari\n\n*Any one or even all of those files could be the culprit. I would start with deleting (or moving to the desktop) the com.apple.safari.plist\n\n*Re-launch Safari and see if it is better. If it is you will have to re-select your Safari preferences (home page, tabs and other preferences)\n\n*If that didn't fix it I would (exit Safari first) remove (one at a time if you like) the other com.apple.safari. preference files and re-launch and see if that fixed it.\n\n*Failing all of that there is one more thing. In the preferences folder there is another folder called \"Safari\" that holds a lot of preferences, settings and other things Safari uses. Quit out of Safari, move that folder to the desktop and launch Safari again and see if that fixes the issue.\n\nIf that fails then it may be time to repair macOS, which is often accomplished by installing the most recent Combo Update released by Apple (only download from apple.com!).

I need to find the largest video files, because my videos takes a lot of space\n\nbut I dont know how to do this:\n\nIt seems to not to be there any option for filtering by size\n\nA: As you surmised and @jstarek noted in their comment, the Photos app does not have a simple feature to sort by size. So there’s no easy way to answer your question, but here’s what I would do in your case.\nThe images are kept in a database with an underlying file structure that uses program generated unique names for the files. But, with a bit of work, it is possible to see the files in Finder, sort by size and correlate them to the photos app to delete them. The images are contained in a “package”  file usually named “Photos Library.photoslibrary” in your Pictures folder. To find it, open the Photos app and check under Photos->Preferences for the Library location and click “Show in Finder”. Now control-click on the file and select “Show Package Contents” from the pop-up menu. The package is really just a folder with subfolders as usual. Open the “originals” folder and you will see a list of subfolders with names like 0, 1, 2, etc. - these contain the image files. Set finder to view by columns, open one of the numbered subfolders and click the Size column heading to sort by file size. The files all have unique IDs for names, but you can still double-click these files to open them with their default viewer and play the video.\n\nThe Photos app keeps a thumbnail image for each of these with a link to the file in its database. Now you have two choices: go back to the Photos app and browse for the video that you found and delete it, or keep the Photos app closed and simply move the file to the trash. The first way is more work, but safe since you won’t be temporarily corrupting the library. If you do the latter, the Photos app will still have the thumbnail image, but the link to the original file will be broken when you select the thumbnail. You can then delete the thumbnail from Photos.\nSo, it’s a bit of work and might be a little scary, but maybe you’ll find it useful.\n\nA: Here's a crude JXA script, that sorts items in a given album by size.\nUsing it is a bit cumbersome.\nFirst, prepare your Photos library:\n\n*\n\n*Create an album named “Input” at the root of your library\n\n*Create an album named “Input sorted” also at the root\n\n*In the first album, add the items you want sorted. In your case, that'd be all your videos.\n\n*In the second album, add two items, any items. Within the album, reorder the items, by dragging the second one before the first. This strange dance will have the effect of disabling Photo's auto-sorting of this album. You can then remove these items from the album.\n\nYou can now run the script:\n\n*\n\n*Copy-paste the script below in a new document in Script Editor.app\n\n\n*Switch the document to JavaScript using the dropdown in the toolbar: \n(if the toolbar isn't visible, toggle it with View > Show Toolbar)\n\n\n*Click the Run button in the toolbar.\nThe script:\n(function() {\n    // Config\n    const albumToSort = \"Input\";\n    const sortCriteria = \"size\";\n\n    // Functions\n    function toRealArray(automationArray) {\n        let result = [];\n    \n        for (let i = 0; i < automationArray.length; i++) {\n            result.push(automationArray[i]);\n        }\n    \n        return result;\n    }\n\n    // Initialize\n    let photosApp = Application('Photos');\n    let app = Application.currentApplication();\n    app.includeStandardAdditions = true;\n\n    // Get album\n    const sourceAlbum = photosApp.albums.byName(albumToSort);\n\n    // Create destination album\n    const destinationAlbumName = sourceAlbum.name() + \" sorted\";\n    const destinationAlbum = photosApp.albums.byName(destinationAlbumName);\n\n    // Get and sort items\n    const items = toRealArray(sourceAlbum.mediaItems());\n    items.sort((a, b) => \n        a[sortCriteria]() - b[sortCriteria]()\n    );\n\n    // Add items to destination, in order\n    items.forEach(item =>\n        photosApp.add([item], {to: destinationAlbum})\n    );\n\n    // Show completion notification\n    app.displayNotification(\"Album has been sorted.\", {\n        withTitle: \"Sort album\"\n    });\n})();\n\n\nA: Using bash scripting you can at least find them fast.

I'm going through this exercise to compress the videos via handbrake.\n\nA: It seems not mentioned, there is a straightforward approach.

That will save more space than is in the new folder, because Photos creates a lot of supporting files for its contents.  (Actually the space is not reclaimed until you also clear out the \"recently deleted\" collection.)\nIf you don't get a notification when the export completes, you can compare the number of items selected in Photos to the number of items in the new folder.\n", "Q: Use the same external hard drive for two different Time Machine's? Is it possible to use the same external hard drive for two different Time Machine backups of two distinct MacBooks?\nIs yes, how do you have to set up the external hard drive, using which tools?\n\nA: Yes. Setup is easy.\n\n*\n\n*Connect the drive to the first Mac directly (USB or whatever is fastest)\n\n*Add the drive in Time Machine Preferences\n\n*Use System Preferences, the menu bar or tmutil to make a backup.\n\n*Eject the drive from the first Mac once you have a couple backups completed.\n\n*Repeat the above steps for the second Mac.\n\nNow when each Mac tries an hourly backup, if the drive is connected, it will update the backups there. (Make a new interval, expire any old intervals needed). If it’s not connected, you don’t get backups, but do get a warning every 2 weeks to reconnect an absent drive. It’s fine for one Mac to back up to multiple drives as well.\n\nNow, you didn't ask for general advice, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\n*\n\n*With two Macs, I often set up a three drive rotation. Rotate the drives once a month with one always off site is a good place to start if you don’t do backup rotations yet. You can safely remove that disk from system preferences so you are not nagged if you get those alerts.\n\n*I like naming drives Backup A, Backup B and putting a file on the root with the serial number of the drive, purchase date, warranty (if any) and date entering service in a text file.\n\nSo you'd have three drives like if you entered them into service today and the next three days.\nBackup A 20200929\nBackup B 20200930\nBackup C 20201001\nAlso, last bit of \"advice\" that wasn't asked for - I put a drive on the shelf as soon as it fills. I don't erase them, just buy another inexpensive drive and then add it to the rotation.

She has the video files saved on her iPad into a directory called \"my files\".  She recently bought a chromecast so that she can play these files on her TV, however all the apps she has tried only allow her to select files from the camera roll, and not the video files she has downloaded.\n\n*\n\n*Is there an app that will allow her to cast video files from locations other than the camera roll?\n\n*If not, is there a way to move the downloaded files into the camera roll?\n\nShe has tried an app that mirrors her screen to the TV but the quality is really bad, and the differences in aspect ratio make it so that you can't go fullscreen.\n\nA: She can use the Files app on the iPad to copy the files into Photos (what you call the camera roll). Simply open Files, navigate to the \"my files\" directory, tap on the video and press the Share icon (square with arrow pointing upwards). In the Share sheet she should select \"Save video\". This stores a copy of the video in Photos.\nA different approach is to install a video player app such as \"VLC\" from the App Store. Now in the Files app, open the share sheet for the video and select to share it to VLC. Now it will play in VLC and you can tap the Chromecast icon to get it on the TV.\n\nA: This solves your problem: Upload the videos to YouTube; (mark them private if you wish.)

A co-worker resigned last week, and just returned his Macbook to the office.\nNow I'm backing up all the data before deleting his Mac account.\nHe had plenty of notes stored in the Notes app. I don't see a feature to export multiple notes to a zip file or Google Drive/Dropbox/etc. Sharing each one of them via email will be tedious.\nI wonder if it's possible to move them to USB flashdrive, for example.\n\nA: There is an app named Note2Txt which will convert all your notes to a text file. One file for each note. it runs very fast and you can store the text files wherever you like.  It works fine normally but i had a problem with it on Catalina.\nThere is also an app named Exporter which will convert all your notes to Markup files. Again you can put the output to any folder you like and have write permissions.\nBoth of these apps will convert all your notes to files. You can use the Notes app to convert a single note to a PDF but that doesn't run in batch mode.\n", "Q: How to safely delete .inProgress Time Machine backup? I attempted to start a Time Machine backup but the backup failed due to insufficient space. I now have a useless 60 GB .inProgress file that's eating into my already limited storage space.\nFor a seemingly easily-achieved problem, there are few resources online for this. A pre-Catalina article from 2018 suggests using tmutil delete /path, as do these Ask Different answers. All of these answers are also pre-Catalina.*\nWith such consensus of answers I tried sudo tmutil /path/backup.inProgress but received a return message of \"Invalid deletion target (error 22)\" and \"Total Deleted: 0B\"\n$ sudo tmutil delete /Volumes/XXXX/Backups.backupdb/XXXX/2020-09-30-004400.inProgress\nPassword:\n/Volumes/XXXX/Backups.backupdb/XXXX/2020-09-30-004400.inProgress: Invalid deletion target (error 22)\nTotal deleted: 0B\n\nAlso, when I run tmutil listbackups Terminal only prints completed backups (as the manual indicates should be the case).\nHow can I safely delete the 60 GB .inProgress file?\n*This answer suggests simply dragging the .inProgress file into the Trash – though from personal experience I know this is wrong and leads to problems – namely a perpetually stuck Time Machine and an impossible to empty Trash.\n\nA: I’ve never seen deletion happen faster than letting the next backup use or delete the files in that folder.\nThe next backup interval prunes and cleans this folder. If you have 24 hours of backups and still have a hung inProgress, I would open a case directly with Apple. There is a prune step before copying so hopefully you’re not in a total jam where it can not self rescue with enough time.\nWith hard links, it’s unlikely you are using any space on these files, since another interval already covers them or the next interval will reuse that space.\n\nThe risk of messing with the backups is you ruin that destination so unless you are willing to make that destination read-only and start backing up to a new destination, I would not mess with this manually - even to try to convince tmutil to delete that non-interval.\nI have had great success using time machine utility to delete whole backups and letting the system run to pre-clean and post-clean these progress folders. When the progress folder remains for more than a day of successful backups, you usually have another problem and poking at a system with one failure isn’t likely to address the main problem. You could also try to bypass and clean up a large file if that helps you get space back if deleting intervals doesn’t prune enough space.\n\nA: On Catalina, running\nsudo tmutil delete /path/to/foo.inProgress\n\nreturns error 22, but\nsudo tmutil delete /path/to/foo.inProgress/*\n\naka deleting backups inside the inProgress folder, works for me.\n\nA: Regarding the Invalid deletion target (error 22): I've found that one might need to add the terminal app to the list of apps with Full Disk Access, available through System preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access.\n", "Q: How do I see where can a sandboxed Mac application write on my disk?

Well, put simply, personally I find that often the shape detection on the shape pen can get in the way of drawing what you intended, and at some point the frustration of having to switch back to the original drawing in the tab that appears on the top right can be annoying and makes you use the freehand.\nQuestion:\nA few hours ago the freehand tool disappeared. Yesterday I was using it fine, now it is gone.\nI've also noticed (though I'm not sure if its always been there) that there is now an ability to make a note on the doc. You can see the disappearance of the pen below (on a PDF doc):\n\n\nIs this indicative of some preview update which has removed the freehand pen?\nHow can I get the freehand pen back?\n\nA: I was a fan of the freehand draw tool as well, because on Stack Exchange we always use freehand circles*, so I was displeased when the sketch tool started to 'autocorrect' my freehand shapes; it was always possible to use the original but that required an extra click. For me, this behaviour started long ago (3 or 4 years). I had never seen the option you mentioned, two different pens.\nBut as of a few weeks, the 'Draw' tool is back (the blue circle), and it provides freehand drawing once more (the red circle):\n\nI have an M1 MacBook Pro (2020) running on macOS Big Sur 11.5.2. Interestingly, on my Intel MacBook Pro from 2013, running the same OS version, Preview doesn't have the Draw tool. It might be related to the old one not having a Force Touch Trackpad.\n*: actually, they're often more like ellipses or rounded rectangles...\n", "Q: Delay in screenshots and cursor issue on MacOS after update? I'm running 10.14.6 (18G6032) Mojave on my early 2015 macbook pro. There was some kind of software update in the past week, and I've noticed 2 issues since I updated that I suspect was due to the update.\n(1) The screenshot option Command + Shift + Control + 4 seems to now be delayed. By this, I mean when you press those 4 keys and release, you get this \"target\" looking symbol that shows up to select where you want to start the screenshot. This target used to pop up instantly, but now there seems to be a 1 second delay.\n(2) My mouse cursor seems to randomly disappear sometimes, especially when I go into full screen mode on a video. The cursor still works, but I can't see it on the screen. I have to move the \"invisible\" cursor to the top left apple logo and click on it, and that makes it reappear.\nHas anyone experienced these issues?\n\nA: The first thing to check is if a process is taking much CPU. Are you familiar with the Activity Monitor?\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/activity-monitor/welcome/mac\nI like to give it a try and make sure you have a backup if you are quitting processes you don’t usually start yourself (like Chrome or Safari or FireFox) in case stopping the process interrupts some work it needed to do. It also prepares you if you decide to reinstall the OS. Sometimes an update doesn’t complete its steps to be ready to run properly and just reinstalling it sorts out a newly slow machine.\n", "Q: Question marks folder when I turn on my mac I recently tried to reinstall macOS on my MacBook Air 2017 (Catalina) because it was slow and full of problems (for example, I didn't have any disk space though I had deleted and uninstalled everything).\nSo I started to follow a tutorial: I launched my device by going to my mac recovery, \"Disk utility\" and I deleted all the data in my Macintosh disk.\nI don't know why, but my mac turned off. When I turned it back on, I saw a question mark inside a folder.\nSo I turned on my mac again, and I pressed CMD + r. I see a progress bar with a planet. It seems to work for now. But after that, when the progress bar is loading with the apple logo, there is a startup sound, the screen becomes completely black, and it comes back to the question mark inside a folder.\nI also followed this tutorial. The unique difference is that I press alt rather than cmd + r. I select my wifi, and the downloading of the OS seems to work again, but still the same issue.\nHere is a video of the issue.\nI tried again and again, the same thing happens everytime, at the same level of loading.\nI already tried to reset the NVRAM, but it changes nothing.\nIf you have a possible solution to share me... thanks !\n\nA: After several trials, it finally worked.

Yes it's the lowest-end 8Gb iMac from last year.\nWith no apps running, nothing in the apps to start on login, with a new virgin account created yesterday, with the latest MacOS installed, opening system preferences - just opening it - can take over 30 seconds. Every time. With a beachball wait cursor.\nThis is not just a little slow. This is unbelievably slow. This is slower than my 10 year old MacBook Pro.\nI've run every test on it that I can think of. Checked for processes that are using CPU. Checked for free memory.\nDoes anyone have a clue?\nCould it be misconfigured somehow that makes it truly unusable?\nUpdate\nIf this performance is because of the hard disk then you are saying that Apple is selling a configuration of iMac (in early 2020) that is hopelessly misconfigured. It's as if they were selling a computer with a 128Meg disk or with 1Gig of memory. Can that actually be?\n\nA: You are on the correct track to make specific benchmarks and time them.\nSo if you have “open system preferences” you can repeat it. If it takes 30 seconds to open 5 times in a row, you could run some tests to see if it’s network or disk or CPU that’s constraining it.\nIf it speeds up the second and third times, then it’s a different issue.\nCan you reproduce this in a new user account on the Mac with no startup items?\nEither way, using the first two Activity Monitor functions to end high CPU use processes and see overall energy use should out any apps causing a slowdown. Also, do you need more ram?\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/activity-monitor/welcome/mac\n\nA: It is slow because you are using an HDD.

One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.\n\nSo what do I do now?\nIt seems Apple has pulled the updates, so we can hope there will be some fix and revised update for everyone who hasn't installed the updates yet soon .\nThe current solutions (detailed on the above link), other than waiting, are that you can do a full re-install of macOS 10.14.6 - over the top, and then go from there.\nInstalling Catalina is another option, though that may not solve all issues, especially as the latest Catalina patch is also causing issues for some: https://mrmacintosh.com/catalina-10-15-7-update-accountsd-using-400-if-using-icloud-mail/\nI'd read and keep an eye on the above link as it gets updated with latest best practice ways to resolve this, and when Apple release an update that resolves things - though it's probably best to wait and see the reaction to that, when it does appear.\nHope this helps!\nUPDATE: (1st Oct 2020 13:39 UTC)\nJust tried again offhand and now all the updates installed.

If you made changes while logged in as another account, then that account may be the owner of that file.\nBut if you type open /tmp in Terminal, and you get the same window geometry, it’s probably something different.\n", "Q: New \"Resource busy\" error when trying to mount DMG files I am having a new issue where DMG files sometimes fail to mount due to \"Resource busy\" error.\nThis sometimes occurs and other times doesn't occur.\nTemporary solutions include trying downloading the file through another browser, moving the file somewhere else before opening it, or trying again later, but they don't always fix the issue.\nHow can I fix this error for a permanent solution?\n\nA: I'm having this issue as well and its driving me crazy. Here is what I found out but I don't have a solution.\nAfter I download a .dmg (image) file through my browser, even though I do not open or mount the image the following things occur:\n\n*\n\n*diskimage process runs against the downloaded dmg. Duration of this seems to last for quite a bit of time. (in my example it was about 12 seconds on my machine for this 160MB image file but with larger images it could last longer and depends on machine resources)\n\n*A directory appears in my /private/tmp with a copy of the image. When the diskimage process completes, this directory disappears.\n\nIf you try to mount the image while the above conditions are occurring, you will get a resource busy error.\nHow do you know when you can mount the image? Use the lsof command. And if you are using homebrew, you can install a handy utility called watch. Watch just runs the command repeatedly ever 1 second (-n 1)\nSo use a command like this from the terminal. In my example, I'm just downloading the image file to my Downloads directory. I'm not trying to open the image or mount the image.\nwatch -n 1 \"lsof +D /Users/gman/Downloads\" \n\nAfter the download finishes, then the output of the command shows this:\nEvery 1.0s: lsof +D /Users/gman/Downloads                          w4sp Sat Feb 20 10:18:06 2021\n\nCOMMAND     PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE  SIZE/OFF    NODE NAME\ndiskimage 46638 gman    3r   REG    1,5 159570818 8771639 /Users/gman/Downloads/Notion-2.0.11.dmg\n\nWhen the diskimage entry disappears from the lsof command (and this may take some time), you can then open image and mount it without getting the resource busy message.\n", "Q: Using Variables with AppleScript Action in Automator Hoping someone can help me figure this out. I'm trying to build a Quick Action in Automator that copies three text values, stores them as variables, then pastes them when directed. Right now I built it where it runs AppleScript to copy the first value from a spreadsheet to the clipboard, gets the contents of the clipboard, sets the value of the variable, then repeats that another two times. That part seems to work, but the next step has not. I tried to run an AppleScript where the variable is passed in, the input is set as the value of a new variable, then System Events keystrokes the variable. I either get the error that the variable isn't define or that the keystroke can't continue.\nAny Suggestions? Screenshots of my workflow:\n\n\n\nA: Keystroke means it will send a \"C\" to the program and not actually press the C key. Try using key code 8 using command down.\nAlso, you may want to add a line with activate after the \"tell Excel\" command to ensure the program is the frontmost application.\nFinally, use delay 0.5 between commands, so the program has enough time to process the information before firing the next step.\nYou can get a list of full key codes here:\nhttps://eastmanreference.com/complete-list-of-applescript-key-codes\nOther possible issues: make sure the get value of variable is ignoring the preceding action, otherwise sometimes Automator will pass more than one variable ahead. You could also use item 1 of input as string, because sometimes it will get the wrong kind of data.\n", "Q: What is the name of this application?

Sometimes, when I'm suddenly frustrated by something problematic I read on Reddit, I punch my iPhone SE (the 2016 version) screen from a couple inches away using my finger joints while holding it in my other hand (I know, bad habit). I'm wondering whether this bad habit has any risk of causing long-term negative effects to my iPhone, like breaking something on the PCB or damaging the battery.\n\nA: Sure it can, just like dropping it on the floor.\n999 times you'll get away with it, the 1000th you'll break something.\nAs this is entirely behavioural rather than accidental, I'd suggest you learn to not do it.\n", "Q: Apple Watch 6 blood oxygen measurement said I had hypoxia when I in reality was fine. How to know if reading is taken in optimal conditions? TL;DR: How can I know if the SpO2 reading is in fact taken in optimal conditions ?\n\nA: As much as I understand your frustration, Apple mentions the limits in the small print at the bottom of https://www.apple.com/watch/:\n\nBlood Oxygen app measurements are not intended for medical use, including self-diagnosis or consultation with a doctor, and are only designed for general fitness and wellness purposes.\n\n\nA: I have had similar conversations with people about other aspects of Apple Watch - heart rate not matching expectations, people comparing their activity with another and feeling the calories or heart rate or distance travelled aren't the same, so hopefully some of that perspective can help you and others.\nI find the largest value for my health data is longitudinal tracking of my stats with my watch and my band. Yes - an instant value is nice when perfect, but over time, those measurements are easier to trust as you see how they vary.\nEach of us has different mechanics, melanin pigmentation, and bone structure. The watch is a sensor and it surely aims to get a good result, but your results will naturally be different from mine. What doesn't change is your results day after day and week after week with the same sensor will give you good information how your body is changing.\nSpecifically, pulse rate and SpO2 are visual sensors, so band tightness, interference due to body hair, transdermal fat content, skin pigmentation, current moisture levels, and your specific capillary structure and location of anterior arteries and veins on your watch bearing wrist should affect the readings. I'm sure Apple tried to control for this, but the variation in humans is going to make some people have larger error than others. Hopefully you are able to get decent results once you control for the elements you have control over.\nThis error and confirmation of accuracy happens all the time in physiological labs for any medical measurement. The instruments are almost always very precise (measuring temperature to a tenth of a degree) but not always accurate - three devices all read 37.2° (or 99.0° in a few countries).\nSame with estimating your stride length - if you are training against yourself - it doesn't matter if the reality is your steps are 1.4m and it's measures 1.2m if you're just looking at how far you go compared to yesterday and if you went further or faster than you did in the workout yesterday. Basically, don't overlook the value in longitudinal data even if it's not absolutely perfect.\nMy hunch is nailing the calibration is what's expensive and pricey (like building several redundant sensors). Many instruments that are cleared for medical use have formal calibration procedures, which is one reason the Apple Watch isn't cleared for that level of diagnosis. It lacks the ability to perform a calibration step if you determine it's not precise and accurate enough for you.\nAlso, this assumes the watch is perfect and the sensors are perfect. If over time you can't get a good pulse read / SpO2 read - maybe Apple would exchange it, but I'd hate for you to go through a swap if the device is working as designed and it's just not what you need where your body and Apple's design meet.\n", "Q: iOS 14 WiFi 5GHz issues After updating my iPhone 11 to iOS 14 I've noticed that I constantly face issues with my WiFi network.\nWhat happens is that you use the Internet and suddenly notice that webpage is stuck or whatever indicating network issues. WiFi is connected with no Internet connection though. A while later (usually 1 min or less) a connection is re-established (it just starts working again) and everything works fine.\nWhat's interesting is that this only happens to 5G WiFi network and only this device is experiencing such a problem.\nWhen using 2.4G there is no problems and connection is always stable.\nI've already tried resetting the network settings with no success though.\nIs there anything that can be done? (without full reset)\n\nA: In iOS14, there is an additional network setting that offers extra privacy/security by providing a private wifi address individual to each wifi network you connect to, which is particularly useful when connecting to public wifi networks. However, there have been reports of connection/performance issues when using private wifi addresses, particularly with wifi networks that have multiple wifi access points.\nSo as a troubleshooting step, you may wish to disable the private wifi address for the particular affected wifi network. You can disable the private wifi address by going to Settings>Wi-Fi and press the ⓘ symbol of the affected wifi network (when you are connected to it) and midway down you will be able to disable the Private Address. Doing so will revert the wifi address to the device's default wifi address but only for that wifi network. This won't affect other wifi networks you have saved/connected to, but you can individually disable the private address for those too, when you are next connected to them. I'm not sure if this will fix your issue, but it is worth trying out.\nAdditionally, is it affecting other 5GHz wifi networks or just one specific 5GHz wifi network? It may have something to do with the 5GHz channel band the wifi network is on. If there's lots of other wifi networks (like in an apartment block) on the same channel band it can cause signal interference which is particularly worse on 5GHz networks than on 2.4GHz networks.\nSo, if it is just affecting the single wifi network, then it may be worth checking whether the channel band is on the same channel band as other nearby wifi networks and try change it to one that has the least amount of wifi networks on the same channel band. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: How do you entirely backup Google Chrome? Google Chrome account sync does not sync everything. For example, it's missing the configuration of extensions that do not make use of cloud sync.\nWhat is the best way to backup Google Chrome in case you want to reinstall it on another machine or in case your current machine dies?\nPS: Would Time Machine completely restore Google Chrome or would parts be missing?\n\nA: While I can't speak to the completeness of the Google Chrome account sync, All of the settings for your Google Chrome account are kept in your user profile.\nSo there are a couple of ways to proceed\n\n*\n\n*Keep a current backup of at least your user profile using the backup utility of your choice.\n\n*Time Machine works well for #1 above as it backs up your user profile by default (in addition to everything else.)\n\n*You can use the Migration Assistant to migrate your entire user profile (Apps, too) from your old Mac to any new Mac as long as you have a backup or access to the HD or SSD in your old Mac.

Something like this to find the process using TCP protocol on port 80:\nnetstat -anv -p tcp | grep \"*.80\"\nHere's a helpful resource with other options: https://www.btaz.com/mac-os-x/find-the-process-listening-to-port-on-mac-os-x/\n", "Q: Mac Becoming Extremely Unresponsive After Updating OS (Low CPU Usage) I recently updated my 2015 iMac to the new OS (10.15.7) and at times it becomes incredibly sluggish to the point of not being able to do any productive work. It sometimes takes 20-30 seconds just to click a button; sometimes opening a web page takes minutes. I recently gutted the computer in an attempt to speed it up, and before updating the OS it worked really well. To download XCode I had to download the new operating system, and after downloading it the Mac has slowed down considerably, even though the CPU usage stays very low.\nIt seems to be getting worse. Yesterday I was able to run the iOS simulator and it wasn't running too poorly, but today the simulator wont even start up. I've tried restarting the computer. I just don't understand why my mac has become so sluggish even though the CPU isn't being fully utilized whatsoever.\nWhy would my mac run slow if the CPU usage is very low?\n\nA: There are a number of possible reasons for sluggishness after an OS update. The OS update is usually not the cause, but often the 'catalyst'. The chain of events leads many to believe incorrectly that \"the OS update killed my Mac\".\n1. Hard disk failure.\nInstalling a new OS involves writing several GB to the disk. If your hard drive is several years old, then this work may be the straw that breaks the camel's back. A disk may continue to 'work', but be slow.\nLow CPU usage but poor performance does sound like a disk problem.\n2. Incompatible software.\nOlder third-party software may not work well with the new OS. This is particularly true for things that 'get their hooks' into the OS, running background processes or low-level IO tasks. Things like hardware drivers, system monitors, or anything that changes the behaviour of the OS are usual suspects. Look in /Library (and <user>/Library) folders such as LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons; also Login Items in the Users & Groups System Preference pane.\nYou can test this by performing a Safe Boot , which will start your OS without any of these third party software. Restart normally after testing. Performing a Safe Boot will also clear some caches, which may help. (Though wildly emptying all caches will in fact cause some slowness as the OS attempts to rebuild them all!)\nAnother useful test is creating a new user account and logging into that. If things works well there, then you know the problem is something in your original user account, and not the OS itself or the hardware. The problem may be a corrupt or incorrect user preference file, user-triggered third-party software, or something else based in the user Library. Go back to the old user account, and start isolating the problem.\nDon't just migrate to the new account: this may cause permissions problems with files; and if the issue crops up again, you'll have to move on again!\n3. Spotlight/Cache rebuilding.\nAfter an OS update, the computer will spend some time re-filling caches and re-indexing Spotlight. You should see some evidence of this in Activity Monitor, such as high CPU for processes like mdworker. But this activity should subside after a couple of hours or so. (It may run into the night, but should be finished by the next morning.)\nIf it seems to be stuck, you can force another rebuild of the index, though this obviously will also take some time to complete.\n\nA: How recently?\nThat would be a good first question.\nI have a mid 2015 MacBook Pro and installing Catalina (a couple of months ago) has resulted in slowness during the first few days (seemingly because the system was still updating things in the background, Spotlight and the like) but that cleared up.\nSince then it has been less stable than Mojave. I have noticed that it locks up more often (requiring a cold reboot) Sometimes the lockups on last 15-20 seconds and it does come back to life. Sometimes.\nCatalina is not a good version of macOS.\nI did find that running a \"cleaner program\" helps a bit. the one I use is Onyx it is free and does the trick, at least for me.\nI would recommend running that and turning off any startup items, for the time being. That may help.\n\nA: I have the same issue, MacBook pro, 13in, 2012 mid.\nalso music is affected library of synced cd,s scattered through out \"music\"\ni used time machine went back one day before latest update, then removed all\nmy synced music cd's {non apple purchase}, i got most of those public library, and its not that hard to just burn them in again after i reinstal latest catalina os.\nthe older library's 32 bit is issue, much new operating system,64, problem is, putting a few cd's back after I reinstalled the new catalina,and i downloaded the apple purchesed. IT was better, still makes a separate lybary, for what I burned in. However its still using a lot of resources, Ian also removing apps and reinstalling,thoes. from what Ive gleaned taking to apple support.\nits pretty much 32 bit is dead,\n\n", "Q: Record Notability Notes with AirPods Pro to iPad Pro (and/or Mac)? I live in a studio apartment with my boyfriend who often works really late. He gets home at 3am and needs to get quality rest. The problem is I need to attend all of my online classes in-person at 8 am in the morning. I really want to be able to record the lectures on Notability (so that I can play them back later in a way the is connected the the timing of the note modifying) while using Notability on my iPad Pro.\nI’m viewing the lecture on my MacBook, but if it makes the solution easier I can also enter the lecture (Zoom) on my iPad Pro.\n\nA: Have you asked your lecturer to record the lectures so you might review them later?\n\n*\n\n*https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-recording\nIf they won’t, perhaps they would let you record it on your MacBook. This might be easier than using iOS screen recording.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935\nWe record town halls on the presenter side and it works great for playback later. No one needs to handle it on the attendance side.\nLast option, macOS can record the screen and your voice easily from AirPods or any other speaker / microphone combination.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721\nYou would need help if you wanted to loop the meeting audio into the recording.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/\nThere is an academic discount for Sound Source if you decide it helps you after testing the free trial to keep the sound low while you study and learn.\n\nA: I use the Quicktime screen recording feature combined with Soundflower, which is a program that allows you to internally route audio via “virtual audio cables” (file paths) from your computer's system output to recording software. Soundflower creates a virtual “audio device” on your machine that your audio system can see. That will allow you to reroute the output of the computer as a microphone. You won't be able to hear anything during the class but it will record all the sounds from the system together with the screen.\nAfter installing the plugin, you will be able to output the sound of your system like this:\n\nWhen you open the Quicktime Screen Recording, select the Soundflower as a microphone:\n\nSo the system will output all sounds to the input, and Quicktime will record video & audio from whatever you do. However you won't be able to hear anything while the output is routed.

Sometimes it seems like Time Machine backups, file transfers, and software updates speed up after focusing their windows.\nIs this just psychological or an actual feature?\n\nA: It's most probably not psychological as multiple things affect the allocation of system resources, and being a foreground window is one of them.\nIn general all processes (and even threads) running on a system has a priority, which is used to determine the amount of CPU resources made available to it. If you open a normal GUI program, it will start with a priority of 46. If it is the foreground window, the priority is increased by 1 to 47.\nThe actual range of priorities on a live system is much larger as other things factor into the process priority. They range from 0 (lowest priority) to usually 97 (queue in a real time process). For ordinary programs you run, you'll usually see priorities such as 20 (utility program), 31 (base priority), 46 (background) and 47 (foreground).\nYou might be experiencing the impact of a feature known as \"App Nap\". It essentially slows down applications that the system thinks the user is not actively using in order to speed save energy and/or improve performance of other apps.\nSpecially it targets apps that are:\n\n*\n\n*not the foreground (selected) app\n\n*hasn't recently updated visible information on screen\n\n*isn't playing audio\n\n*isn't using OpenGL 3D graphics\n\n*isn't actively managing energy usage using IOKit/NSProcessInfo\n\nWhen those conditions are in place, the application can be put into App Nap. If you look at Activity Monitor in the Energy tab, you'll see a column named \"App Nap\". If this says \"Yes\", the app is napping.\nWhen an application is in App Nap it runs slower due to a reduction of its CPU priority, throttling of I/O and throtting of timers.\nYou can read more about App Nap in Apple's documentation here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/AppNap.html\nAs far as I recall, the priority of an App Nap'ed program is 4.\n", "Q: mail.app shows the wrong date for emails I have a very long history of emails 30+ years.\nSome of my old emails are showed with the wrong date in mail.app.\nExample:\nThese are the headers after anonymizing the data:\nReceived: from speedy.grolier.fr (speedy.grolier.fr [194.158.97.87]) by ns.calvacom.fr (8.7.3/8.6.9) with ESMTP id OAA21857 for <*@*>; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 14:02:35 +0200 (MET DST)\nReceived: from *.club-internet.fr (ppp-207-54.neuilly.club-internet.fr [194.117.207.54]) by speedy.grolier.fr (8.7.5/MGC-960516) with ESMTP id OAA16943 for <*@*>; Fri, 6 Sep 1996 14:00:14 +0200 (MET DST)\nX-UIDL: 842012897.000\nMessage-Id: <*@speedy.grolier.fr>\nFrom: \"*\" <*@*>\nTo: \"*\" <*@*>\nSubject: Re: Faites-vous connaitre\nDate: Fri, 6 Sep 1996 13:56:38 +0200\nX-MSMail-Priority: Normal\nX-Priority: 3\nX-Mailer: Microsoft Internet Mail 4.70.1132\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n\nbelow the body of the email.\n\nSo we can see that\n\n*\n\n*Received: has Fri, 6 Sep 1996 14:02:35 +0200 (MET DST) and Fri, 6 Sep 1996 14:00:14 +0200 (MET DST)\n\n*Date: has Fri, 6 Sep 1996 13:56:38 +0200\nThe displayed date is \nSo I checked with mdls\nmdls  ~/Library/Mail/path_to_email/857941.emlx | grep -i date\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate = 2020-10-02 02:10:10 +0000\nkMDItemFSCreationDate      = 2015-10-13 04:27:22 +0000\n\nno useful data about the email itself.

I tried to install win10 to ssd via efi boot on my macbook air 2012, it ran pretty well as far as performance, but because it's pre-uefi it makes it the garbage windows version with no sound, no proper graphics card, can't change brightness, it's awful, then I tried parallels, and I can tell already that it's going to suck how the mouse moves so that's out.\nSo, my only option is to try a legacy bootcamp partition install somehow sharing the same hdd as my macOS (which has plenty of room and is fast), but this is mostly a novelty thing, I have a windows laptop, so if there's a risk of mangling my mac I'll just get a newer macbook eventually\nIs there a way to make an mbr bootcamp partition? if it's doable safely, any resources would be appreciated as I looked online and it's a mess of forum posts of peoples' problems.\n\nA: Using the boot camp assistant, loading a usb 2.0 usb stick with the iso and drivers, partitioning the drive in boot camp assistant, then letting it reboot into the usb 2.0 installed windows fine on a 2012 macbook air with all windows functionality.\nno need to mess around with efi and weird workarounds to get audio and having screwy drivers.\n", "Q: How to toggle a button using URL? I am trying to create a Shortcut to turn off Location Services on my iPhone. For this, I am using the settings URL scheme to go into Location Services, but I cannot get a direction on how to toggle the button off.\nIs it at all possible to toggle a button using a boolean value in the URL?\nI see there are several Set actions like Set WiFi and Set Bluetooth. Can someone help me understand how these functions work in the background?\nI’m running iOS 14 on an iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nA: Apple does not provide the ability to change settings in the Settings app by a URL.\nYou can only navigate to a page within the app for you to switch the setting yourself as you've found. A URL that could toggle a setting could be a security issue in that the URL could be navigated to by a bad third-party and toggle a setting without your permission.\nActions in the Shortcuts app like the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth toggles use private APIs only available to apps with specific Apple private entitlements.\n", "Q: Is it possible to close windows from App Exposé I have too many Finder windows open. It's a mess!\nFirst, I need to take stock of everything I have open, so I activate App Exposé (aka Mission Control Application Windows) via ⌘↓. App Exposé shows me I have my Trash open in five different windows. I definitely want to close those!\nUnfortunately, while App Exposé makes it easy to see what windows I have open, actually closing them is tedious! I need to individually click each window (which brings it to the front, but deactivates App Exposé), click the red close button (or use ⌘W), then re-activate App Exposé and repeat!\nIs there a quicker way to close windows from App Exposé?\n\nA: Since you can't close the windows thru Mission Control you can just use the Finder to close the windows.  The Finder windows that are open can be easily closed by clicking on the finder in the dock. That will bring all Finder windows to the front, one after another. Then all you have to do is click on the red dot in the left upper corner of each window.\n", "Q: 'du -hs *' on Mac failing with \"du: illegal option -- n\" I want a list of all the sub-directories and their total sizes.

I sold it to a guy on swappa who returned it saying it was in an infinite boot loop. I thought that I would be able to easily fix this. But when I got the MBA back, I immediately went into recovery mode and tried to reinstall macOS. A quick trip to the disk utility made me realise that the ssd is not registering. I would appreciate anyone's help with this.Could I potentially boot from a usb?\n\nA: If the SSD is not showing up in Disk Utility then it is likely that the SSD has failed or the hardware that supports the SSD has failed. The failure is likely coincidental to the OS reinstall and sale, but it can't be ruled out that the purchaser did something to the Mac. What that might be I couldn't tell you.\nRealistically the only way to diagnose this is to open it up, preferably by a certified Mac tech, and see what is going on.\nYou are probably looking at having to replace the SSD (I think this Mac has a removable SSD) in your Mac.\n\nA: You should normally be able to boot up the OS from an external USB drive.\nThe SSD is about the only easily replaceable part inside: (once you've got the correct screwdriver shape for the case screws).\nIt's worth checking that a) it's actually there, and b) seated correctly. After that, you can check whether it has failed only by replacing it.\nThere are original new or secondhand Apple OEM modules on eBay; or you can get third-party units made by OWC and others.\nThis webpage tells you everything you need to know about which of the many Apple SSD modules will fit.\nhttps://beetstech.com/blog/apple-proprietary-ssd-ultimate-guide-to-specs-and-upgrades\n", "Q: Display Terminal message on login I want to display something like ### this is a test ### when a new Terminal window is open (and ideally, in a way that can be disabled easily).

I've created an agent in /Library/LaunchAgents/org.test.greeting.plist with the following code (where the greeting.sh file is responsible for doing the echo) hoping to get some output when the user logs in.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>org.test.greeting</string>\n    \n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/test/greeting.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis hasn't worked, as the message is lost to the ether.

As tradition dictates...\nme@Mac ~ % echo \"Welcome to the University of East Westia\" > /tmp/motd\nme@Mac ~ % sudo mv /tmp/motd /etc\n\nNote: /etc/motd is only displayed in a login shell, which is typical of Terminal.app on macOS.  If you typically run non-login shells, you should handle display of /etc/motd in your shell dot files.\n\nA: Have you tried editing your dotfiles?\nAs a reference, in my ~/.zshrc I have at the very top the command neofetch. Per se, it is just a command you can execute from your shell.

However, if I run a command from my phone that doesn't require elevated permissions (like ifconfig), it does return the output.\nI assume that when I try to run sudo commands from my phone via the shortcuts app, the reason nothing is being returned is because it requires the password (because those commands require elevated permissions), however the shortcut ends as soon as nothing is returned from the SSH server.\nI've tested the same SSH server on different computers, and it all works fine, so I think it's something I need to add additionally for the shortcut on my iPhone to work.\nSo my question is - Is it possible to then enter the password fro a command like sudo apt-get, etc so then the script can continue to run as normal?\n\nA: No, you can't enter a password. The only thing that I can think of is adding the commands you want to be able to run to the sudoers file.\nI'm not sure how to works in Linux but on macOS you put a file in /etc/sudoers.d/something using the visudo command.\nThere seems to be an example page for Linux here: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-sudo-command that might be useful as a starting point.\n", "Q: De-Register for Push Notifications I granted permission for a site to send me push notifications on my desktop, and now I would like to revoke that permissions.\nWhile I can change the delivery permissions in Safari to decline push notifications from that site, my understanding is that this simply prevents them from being displayed, but does not disassociate my device from the specific server sending those push notifications.\nHow can I completely de-register for push notifications from a given website or service, after originally agreeing to receive push notifications?\n\nA: There is no way to force de registration on server side (as of 2021 at least) but you can disable notifications in the client - which is your Safari settings on your device.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/receive-pause-or-stop-notifications-mh40609/mac\nThat tells Apple Push Notification Servers immediately not to pass on any more notifications.

I run a little faster than average, so it underestimates about 300 meters per kilometer. That sucks. I have all the settings correct for using outdoor runs as a data foundation for calibration (I have a lot of runs), but it doesn't make much of a difference. Maybe I move a little bit differently on the treadmill and obtain a more stable posture with more of a constant speed with flat and nice elevation compared to a more up and down all the time environment outside.

While know what AirPrint does, I am confused about what it is. It claims to be a bunch of technology standards used together such as mDNS, IPP and multicasting. However, the term Bonjour is also thrown around as well, which also appears to be based on the same technologies. What makes it even more confusing is that Bonjour is just a rebrand of Rendezvous.\nIs AirPrint a rebrand of Bonjour, the same way Bonjour is a rebrand of Rendezvous, or is AirPrint distinct from Bonjour?\n\nA: First Rendezvous = Bonjour = unicast DNS\nI forget why the name changed from Rendezvous, something about what Apple (used to) call it and what everyone else called it. It’s a server less DNS solution so devices can query locally, self-assemble, and discover services without needing a pre-configured DNS server / database.\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS\n\n*http://www.multicastdns.org/\nAirPrint is a standard Wireless Printing protocol so that diverse printers all look like a standard printer, eliminating the need for specific drivers for specific printers. In the same way that LPR (Line Printer Protocol)is a printing protocol as well as IPP (Internet Printing Protocol).

AirPrint uses Bonjour.\nA very rough and incorrect analogy is that AirPrint is to Bonjour, what an Internet Browser is to the Network connection.\nNote: As PDF fully describes the pages to print, a traditional printer driver is not needed on the device.\n", "Q: How can i see a list of developers I have allowed for apps on my Mac (Mojave) I have recently used \"system preferences, security & privacy, general\" to allow an app downloaded from an identified developer.\nHowever, I was a bit quick and don't believe the developer name (which I have forgotten) corresponded to that on the app in question.\nHow can I see a list of developers that I have allowed and \"un-allow\" one of them, if necessary,?\nThanks.\n\nA: Techinically approving an app from an developer is known as adding a \"GateKeeper exception\". However this is not done based upon the actual name of the developer (such as \"Mega Super Software Ltd.\") but rather based on certificates and so called code directory hashes.\nYou can use the Terminal to review the list of GateKeeoer exceptions you've added with a command like this:\nsudo spctl --list --type execute\n\nAnd you can remove a program from the list of exceptions by running a command like this:\nsudo spctl --remove /Applications/AnApplication.app\n\nwhere AnApplication.app is the app you want to no longer have approved.\nAs you can see the list of exceptions is hard to read as it doesn't include company or personal names, but rather these hash values and references to certificates.\nUsually you'll see certificate rules being based on \"anchor apple\" (which means that the certificate chain of the app starts with Apple's own certificate) and that specific fields such as 6.2.6 and 6.1.13 are present, which means that it should be an Apple Developer certificate. Sometimes you'll also see that the leaf certificate (the last certificate in the chain) needs to have a specification OU (organizational unit) - for example WYH8F23PA3 or similar. This is Apple's internal code number given to organizations that have developer accounts.\nThe rules that are given using code directory hashes looks like 'cdhash H\"1b9a8384....\"' or similar. A code directory hash is a 256-bit number that can be calculated from the contents of the app, is almost guaranteed unique for a specific app and which ensures that if the app code is altered (for example to introduce malicious code) then the code directory hash will no longer match the app.\nThere's no publically available central storage of which actual company names / personal names corresponds with which cdhashes or certificate values. However you can inspect the files on your system to lookup the values for them.\nYou can inspect an application and find the above mentioned values, by running this command in the Terminal:\ncodesign -d -r- -vvvv /Applications/AnApplication.app\n\nIt will output a lot of information, amongst these the cdhash as well as certificate information and the actual company or personal name of the developer ID.\nNote that if you haven't got the actual application anymore, you cannot easily find its cdhash or certificate information. Therefore you can have exception rules stored in GateKeeper for which you cannot find a matching cdhash or certificate.\n", "Q: Is there a way to have time machine work well with iCloud (keeping the backup there)? I have found myself needing to upgrade to the largest iCloud storage space to hold my Photos library, and now have plenty of space.  Apparently I cannot mirror my iTunes music library on the plan I have, and now it appears that I cannot use Time Machine natively with it either which would be nice as I do not use my Time Capsule at the moment.  I simply do not understand why Apple has not made this a business case for their large iCloud plan.\nI've decided I'd like a Time Machine backup on iCloud and work reasonably well.  I do not need the \"restore on blank hardware\" functionalty, just an hourly backup.  Just putting a sparse image on iCloud and telling Time Machine to use that, will most likely result in a copy locally which I do not have room for on my local drive.\nIs there a way that I can use iCloud for Time Machine in a reasonable way so my lone Macbook gets backed up like with Time Capsule?\n\nA: iCloud is not a backup solution, it is a sync solution.\nIt will hold phone/pad backups, but not computer.\nYou cannot use it to store data that is not also present on your devices, other than such as offloading full-resolution photos or documents in low-space situations locally.\nFor true off-site backup you need to be looking at such as Backblaze.\n\nA: The answer to your question is No.\nThere have been various attempts. I seem to remember a company which attempted to offer this several years ago as a commercial product (not even to iCloud, but Time Machine to \"the cloud\"), but I believe they discontinued it, and it was never particularly well-regarded in practice.\nThere have been lots of people who have suggested it, there have been lots of people who have said that it seems like something Apple should definitely do, but there is no way to do it at this point in time.\nI believe that Arq can backup to your Time Capsule and can do hourly backups. It's not Time Machine, but it is, I believe, the next best thing.\nI have found Arq much nicer to work with, and the developer actually responds to emails, which is more than you'd get with using Time Machine.\nFor history buffs, Apple offered a Backup app with a red umbrella icon at the turn of the century to back up select Mac files to iDisk for paid subscribers. The iDisk feature was first delivered on MacOS 9 (and people figured mods to get it to work partially on 8 and 7) and Apple clearly dropped this product over time after seeing how it worked and how supporting customers using it turned out.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2000/01/05Apple-Unveils-Internet-Strategy/\n\niTools became .Mac which became MobileMe which became iCloud and here we are with Apple positioning Time Machine destinations away from local servers even. Over time, Mac backups have been transitioning away from Apple online services and towards direct attached storage.\n", "Q: Keeping photos in sync between phone and laptop (without iCloud?) I have an iPhone and a Macbook running macOS Catalina. I would like to keep my photos in sync between both devices, specifically:\n\n*\n\n*I want to have on the laptop all the photos that I take with the phone.\n\n*I would like to be able to delete photos so they disappear from both devices.\n\n*I would prefer that my phone only has photos that I took with it (i.e. I don't want other photos from my laptop to appear on my phone).\n\n*At the moment I have plenty of available storage on both the phone and the laptop, so space is not going to be a problem in the foreseeable future.\n\nHaving the photos on iCloud seems to be what I need, however I ran out of space there so all recent photos taken with the phone are not uploaded to the cloud and I cannot see them on the laptop.\nI could pay to have additional storage on iCloud, but I'm looking for alternatives.\nI can use the Photos app to import all new photos from the phone to the laptop every once a while. This works and this is actually the kind of solution I'm looking for, but I don't know how to delete photos from both devices without having to delete them manually on both places.\nI don't know if it's possible to have iCloud store only the most recent set of photos, and have the older ones offline. If it's possible, how to do that?\nThanks!\n\nA: The short answer is no. The iCloud sync doesn’t have an easy configuration place to  push data to AWS S3 storage or Azure storage or Backblaze storage. You can back up the Mac to lots of places, but the sync process uses Apple encryption and online services exclusively. You would need to use a different photo app on iOS and MacOS if you wanted different sync options.\nI’m facing a similar dilemma. For years the 200 GB storage was an easy decision, pay a little each month and don’t spend any time cleaning up all the photos I take. Everything could sync everywhere.\nI have a license to PowerPhotos so I could manage two Photos libraries on my Macs and thin the system library that syncs, but in honesty, my time is probably worth more to me to pay for easy sync than use this super powerful software to fork my libraries. I may do some light cleaning and avoid paying the next tier for a few months, but for me the cost is low to have everything in iCloud. It’s not always apparent to me when I find a photo I almost deleted, and then later use it when making a slideshow to celebrate a birthday and I have evidence of them doing something goofy in the background. I’m hesitant to delete photos and don’t spend hours a month curating them. The good news is everyone can choose their preference for time / money / tools so I totally get some people prefer to not pay for any extra storage. If you clean things better than I or have a different way to archive your important photos, keep things clean in iCloud.\n\nA: You can use DropBox to manage  and sync your photos across iOS and MacOS; Google Photos is another option.\nWhile you may be able to hold all your Photos on the cloud server and selectively download, I don't think there's any way to avoid 'back-sync' of photos from your Mac being seen on your phone.\n", "Q: Time Machine fails to eject disk (sparesebundle) on Time Capsule, then cannot mount on different Mac Have MacA and MacB running TM and backing up to the same Time Capsule. TC has the internal drive and two attached USB drives - same problem occurs on all of them. Both Macs are latest version - 10.15.7, and TC is the terminal version 7.9.1\nMacB will frequently show a \"Failed to eject diskX\" message in the log. Then cannot mount that sparsebundle on MacA. This will continue even after complete power down and restart of everything - MacA, MacB, the TC, and the external drives - so some setting must be persisted to one of the drives, but what and where? If MacB is offline for a couple of days (wife's computer and not heavily used), and MacA has gone through a couple of daily power cycles, then suddenly all of the bundles can be mounted. When MacB is turned on again, and generates some new backups, then the same problem recurs.\nHave reported to Apple feedback with full discussion and logs https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/feedback/7739401 but so far crickets.\nWill sometimes (rarely) have the same problem with a sparsebundle for a MacA backup also not being mountable on MacA - this usually clears after one reboot. Note that the remount issue occurs when trying to use Finder, or from the command line with hdiutil or open (using DiskImageMounter internally) - usually get a \"Resource temporarily unavailable\" message. Time Machine itself never seems to have any problem re-mounting these bundles for the next backup.\nSuspect some XATTR setting, but various experiments have all failed.\nAny suggestions?\nThanks\n\nA: You may not like my advice, but walk away from network backups. Use direct attached storage and use two backup destinations if you can’t afford to have one take days to check the filesystem if they eject due to a cable failure, power failure or cat.\nTo have things run as you describe, you’d need dedicated new hardware, have to set up a directory service and/or managing permissions by user ID, manage SMB and possibly AFP sharing services, the source system has to do a ton of overhead to manage the storage bands. Time Capsule is not powerful enough for the task in my experience. It was fine 5 years ago (fine for light use, OK performance) but not anymore.\nWhat’s easy is APFS filesystem on the Mac so your get snapshots and HFS+ filesystem on the storage destination.\n\nAnd to answer your question, you can use tmutil stopbackup to ask for a quick abort, but since you skip any clean up, your next backup interval takes so much longer since the code has to do all the cleanup before it finishes the next interval. I would need to analyze the network capture, but temporary unavailable errors can be due to the server not responding in a timely manner since it’s busy managing files and network as opposed to serving the data to your Mac.\n", "Q: Major High Sierra - iOS-14 sync issues Everything went well when I upgraded from iOS 12 to iOS 13, except that some iOS-macOS High Sierra synchronizations stopped working, or stopped working in full capacity.\nBefore upgrading to iOS 14, I'd like to know.

The get recieves the buffer number that the terminal is on and returns an array of hex codes...\n:echo term_getansicolors(bufnr())\n\nYou can also set the result to your register with:\n:let @\" = join(term_getansicolors(bufnr))\n\nThen you can paste them to have a look at the actual colours and change them.\nThe next bit I haven't got around to trying but theoretically you can just make your own array of hex colours and pass them into term_setansicolors:\n:call term_setansicolors(bufnr(), [ ...my new colours ])\n\nAfter that you could make your own mapping that opens the terminal with that function call included in it, or do something more complicated that gets the colours from your current colorscheme and set them automatically.\nI might have a look at doing it so I'll come back here and post more if it works.\nUpdate (I did do it)\nIf you make a list of highlight names first, you can use these to set the current highlight colour to the gui terminal using the functions synIDattr (syntax ID attribute) and hlID (highlight ID).\nFirst make a list of highlight names with a foreground value fg or the background value bg.\nlet g:term_colourscheme_colours = [\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Vertsplit',    'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Normal',       'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Conditional',  'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Special',      'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'UnderLined',    'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Cursor',       'type': 'bg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Operator',     'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Error',        'type': 'bg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'MoreMsg',      'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Type',         'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Directory',    'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Boolean',      'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Normal',       'type': 'bg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'FoldColumn',   'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'Define',       'type': 'fg' },\n      \\ { 'hi': 'StatusLine',   'type': 'fg' }\n      \\]\n\nThe position matters, so if you don't like these you can swap them around, or even change the hi values (do :hi Directory to see the hex codes for the Directory highlight for example).\nI use the ap/vim-css-color plugin which will shows me colours if I have hex codes on the screen (...it's awesome).\nThe next part is a couple of functions to map over this list and set each item using term_setansicolors:\nfunction MapAnsiTermColours(key, val)\n  silent! let l:colour = synIDattr(hlID(a:val.hi), a:val.type)\n  if len(l:colour)\n    return l:colour\n  else\n    return term_getansicolors(bufnr())[a:key]\n  endif\nendfunction\n\nlet g:MapAnsiTermFunc = function(\"MapAnsiTermColours\")\n\nfunction SetAnsiTermColours()\n  silent! call term_setansicolors(bufnr(), map(g:term_colourscheme_colours, g:MapAnsiTermFunc))\nendfunction\n\nThen the last bit is to call SetAnsiTermColours when a terminal buffer loads:\nautocmd TerminalOpen * silent! call SetAnsiTermColours()\n\n", "Q: Why aren't 2 external monitors working with MBP (mid 2014)? So I have 2 external monitors; One is hdmi, the other is DisplayPort.\nI have a MBP mid-2014 model which contains 2 Thunderbolt 2 ports as well as an HDMI port.\nTheoretically I would have thought I could plug in two miniDP to HDMI cables, run one to monitor #1, and run the second one to an HDMI to DisplayPort adapter -> monitor #2.\nThat did not work, and I since realized only one of the miniDP ports can support video at a time.\nI then read running an HDMI and a miniDP at the same time would work, so I tried that, miniDP->HDMI monitor #1, and then HDMI->HDMI to DP adapter -> monitor #2. Still does not work. Only one monitor shows video.\nFor the life of me, I cannot figure out why this is so difficult to do. I have seen others use USB adapters but would prefer not to sacrifice any CPU usage with the second display.\nWhat possible options do I have for using my 2 external monitors in extended view?\nThank you for any help!\n\nA: According to Apple, your MBP supports dual monitors plus the native display:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/sp703?locale=en_US\nYou may have a bad HDMI>DP adapter, but my bigger question is why are you doing that in the first place? Why take Thunderbolt and convert to HDMI, when you have a HDMI port on the Macbook?\nI recommend that you connect the HDMI port to the HDMI port on one monitor, and you connect the Thunderbolt to DP on the other monitor. Thunderbolt outputs DP 'natively' so its a better fit for DP.\n", "Q: Can't reinstall OS on MacBook Pro from 2009 I formatted the drive on the MacBook Pro because my sister used to own it (she bought it off of ebay) and it had a lot on it. When I started it back up, it booted into OS X utilities and when I tried reinstalling the OS which was El Capitan, it gave me the prompt to sign in to my apple id.

I read somewhere that the new MacBook Air computers (the ones with USB-C) can be charged slowly from any USB source using a USB-C to USB-A adapter.\nI'd imagine that a plane USB port delivers 5W or 10W power. When doing light tasks on the Air, I would imagine that, even when not charging, would allow to extend the battery life significantly.\nCan anyone confirm that this works? What cable do I need?\n\nA: Yes, I can confirm it works for MBA 2020 M1. From regular 10W (5V@2.1A) USB port it takes 1.4A. It's enough to very slowly charge it while watching FullHD video. Even with 5W port MacBook takes 0.9A and a battery is discharging just 0.2W while watching YouTube over WiFi with two steps from minimum brightness.\nAnd it uses only one port to charge even if both are connected to power source :)\n\nA: \nI read somewhere that the new MacBook Air computers (the ones with USB-C) can be charged slowly from any USB source using a USB-C to USB-A adapter.\n\nYes.  This is correct.  The Type C ports on your Mac conform to the USB-PD (Power Delivery Spec) meaning it will negotiate for the maximum charge.\nThe default charge that comes from a USB-PD device starts out at 5V - this, coincidentally is the same voltage that legacy USB chargers output.  If it can negotiate up (to a max of 20V) it will do so.  Otherwise, it will simply draw the maximum which is no more than 12W (5V at 2.4A)\nSo, if you use a 5W charger (airplane, car, etc.), it will take forever to charge that MacBook (you'll drain battery if you attempt to use it while charging), but it will charge.  It will go faster if it's a 12W or 15W port, but still be quite slow.  As for the power draw, it will draw what it can - if the airplane only supplies 5W; that's all you'll get.\nYour best bet is to get a proper USB-C travel charger and hopefully the airplane will have the 12V sockets (car cigarette lighter port) rather than USB ports.\nAs for the cables you need, if it's a USB-A port, just the USB-C to A adapter you already referenced and a USB-C cable which you should already have.\n\nA: Someone did a nice youtube video on exactly that- charging your macbook via usbc from the regular old style usb sockets.  Works fine, and doesn't \"drain your mac\" as some people incorrectly guessed.\nMacPro USB-C can be charged with old style USB-A power sources\nI'm bucking the \"gotta have 61 or 90 watts of power!\" trend.  That high capacity allows for charging the battery very quickly, even while using your Mac to the fullest.  This is the worst possible case.  The more common case is a forgotten charger, or being in an airplane seat with only a USB-A available.\nGoing further, I much prefer a sloooow trickle charge for my macpro.  I sit at a desk all day.  I don't want to quick sear charge to 100%, then slow cook the battery all day.  Neither is great for the battery.  The quick charge is stressful, as well as leaving it plugged in after charge.\nI don't want to constantly plug and unplug my mac during the day to stay in the sweet lithium charge state.  I really wish Apple would implement a charge level cutoff, like a Tesla car has.  Set desired charge level to, say 70 or 80%, and the mac automatically stops charging when it hits that level.  Drops to 40%?  Start charging again.\nSo since Apple doesn't have that, I'll slowly trickle charge it.  Ideally, just feeding it enough power to not use the battery.  Charging my macpro off of a 5w or 12w charger iPhone/iPad charger should work nicely for this.\n\nA: This is similar to trying to charge your MacBook with an old school phone charger. As you indicate yourself you'd need a USB-A to USB-C cable. Enough results if you Google it.\nIn my experience with a MacBook 12\" you get some juice from the charger, but you use more than it delivers. So you can charge your MacBook, very slowly, when it's turned off. And the battery would drain just a little bit slower when using it while connected.\n", "Q: Apple Business Manager Error not covered on support page - Account Update Not Allowed We have begun the processing of syncing Apple Business Manager with our Microsoft Intune instance (all Azure Active Directory accounts) via SCIM.

I have a 2015 Macbook Air. The earliest version of macOS this model ever shipped with was OS X 10.10 Yosemite. However, I want to try installing OS X 10.9 Mavericks, because Yosemite makes my eyes bleed I like Mavericks.\nThis is probably not going to work. Mavericks was not designed to run on my computer and likely lacks the necessary hardware support. But, I'm stubborn and I want to try anyway. If it's going to kernel panic, I want to see the damn kernel panic with my own eyes!\nSo I created a bootable Mavericks USB installer and plugged it into my Macbook Air. I then booted my Mac while holding down the option key to reach the disk selection menu, and selected the installer USB drive.\nAs soon as I select the drive, my Mac immediately flashes a prohibited (\"\") sign. This is not what a kernel panic usually looks like, and it happens too quickly after selecting the drive. Clearly, Apple has implemented some sort of arbitrary check to prevent me from even trying to boot this old OS on my machine.\nFurthermore, there does not appear to be any way to boot the USB drive in verbose mode. Holding down cmdV has no effect.\nHow can I bypass this check and force my Mac to attempt to boot the installer?\n\nA: First things first—we need to get verbose boot working, so we can see what the computer is doing. I don't know why cmdV doesn't work, but there's another way.\nOpen the bootable USB installer in Finder and navigate to Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/, then open com.apple.Boot.plist in a text editor. The important section will look something like this:\n<dict>\n    <key>Kernel Flags</key>\n    <string></string>\n</dict>\n\nSo, currently there are no flags set up. Let's add in the verbose flag by changing it too:\n<dict>\n    <key>Kernel Flags</key>\n    <string>-v</string>\n</dict>\n\nIf I boot the USB installer with this change, instead of a prohibited sign I'll get a message that reads: \"Mac OS X is not supported on this platform!\". This is progress—we now know for sure that we're up against a hardware check—but we still need to bypass the check.\nOpen the USB installer in Finder again, but this time, navigate to System/Library/CoreServices and open PlatformSupport.plist in a text editor. Inside, you will see a list of \"SupportedBoardIds\" and \"SupportedModelProperties\".\n<dict>\n    <key>SupportedBoardIds</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>Mac-031B6874CF7F642A</string>\n        <string>Mac-F2268DC8</string>\n        [...]\n        <string>Mac-F2218EC8</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>SupportedModelProperties</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>MacBookPro4,1</string>\n        <string>Macmini5,3</string>\n        [...]\n        <string>MacBookAir5,1</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n\nAll we need to do is add our Mac's Board ID and model to their respective lists.  You can find your model in System Profiler under Hardware Overview, where it's listed as \"Model Identifier\". In my case, I have a \"MacBookAir7,1\".\nTo find the Board ID, open Terminal and enter: ioreg -l | grep -i board-id. My board ID turned out to be \"Mac-9F18E312C5C2BF0B\".\nI added this information to PlatformSupport.plist like so:\n<dict>\n    <key>SupportedBoardIds</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>Mac-031B6874CF7F642A</string>\n        <string>Mac-F2268DC8</string>\n        [...]\n        <string>Mac-F2218EC8</string>\n        <string>Mac-9F18E312C5C2BF0B</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>SupportedModelProperties</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>MacBookPro4,1</string>\n        <string>Macmini5,3</string>\n        [...]\n        <string>MacBookAir5,1</string>\n        <string>MacBookAir7,1</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n\nAnd now when I boot the installer, I get... a kernel panic! Ta-da! \n\nIn some cases, this might be the end of the road, but I happen to have one more trick up my sleeve. The XNU kernel used by macOS is open source, so it's possible to compile a custom kernel with support for additional hardware. It's not possible for me to do this, but there exist other people who are smarter than me.\nMy 2015 Macbook Air uses a Broadwell processor, and I found this kernel for 10.9.5 which purports to add Broadwell support. I might as well give it a try!\nI downloaded the attachment and copied mach_kernel to the root of my USB installer drive. Note that if I was trying to install OS X 10.10 or newer, I would have copied it to System/Library/Kernels instead.\nIn order for the installer to use my custom kernel, I need to tell it to ignore the kernel cache. To do so, I once again opened Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist in a text editor, and added the -f flag:\n<dict>\n    <key>Kernel Flags</key>\n    <string>-v</string>\n    <string>-f</string>\n</dict>\n\nThen I tried booting the installer again, and...\n\nWait a minute. That wasn't supposed to actually work!\nFor whatever reason, my internal keyboard and trackpad were nonfunctional, so I had to plug in an external keyboard and mouse via USB. But other than that, I was able to open Disk Utility, format the internal drive, and install the OS normally.\nIt is critical that you do not allow your Mac to automatically reboot at the end of the installation, or you'll just end up with another prohibited sign. Remember how we added our Mac's model and board id to PlatformSupport.plist? We need to also make this change to the copy that's been installed on your hard drive.\nWhen your Mac tells you the installation is complete, immediately open the Terminal app and cp PlatformSupport.plist from System/Library/CoreServices on your USB installer to the equivalent location on your hard drive. If you're using a custom kernel, as I was, make sure to copy that as well. With those changes in place, you can safely allow the installer to reboot!\nThat's it, you're done—my 2015 Macbook Air successfully booted into a fully-installed copy of Mavericks. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that there wasn't any graphics acceleration, and I still couldn't use the internal keyboard or trackpad, but I was able to browse the web, play some music, and hop on a Zoom call. And who knows, maybe you'll be luckier than me with your hardware!\nAlso, there's a global pandemic outside and I had nothing better to do with my Sunday afternoon.\n\nP.S. Final note about custom kernels, they tend to get replaced with every OS update, including minor security updates. Before you install an update, back up your custom mach_kernel, and then copy it back after the installation is complete but before you reboot your machine!\nP.P.S. Thank you to AnonMac50 over on the MacRumors forums for giving me the hints about PlatformSupport.plist and com.apple.Boot.plist.

Suppose that a third-party app is encrypted (say, with AES 128), and that this app stores data in iCloud through iCloud Drive. In general, can Apple decrypt this data as it would with data stored in native iOS apps?\n\nA: If Apple is telling the truth, then they can’t access your data, assuming the third-party app developer doesn’t store your AES key in iCloud. Apple has no way to get at a key stored locally on your device (according to Apple) and no way to decrypt the data without the key (according to everything we know about cryptography).\nIf Apple is lying, then of course all encryption keys created or used by third-party apps could be secretly transmitted to Apple’s servers so that they can be used to decrypt your data, even if the app thinks it’s only storing them locally.\n", "Q: Is there any way to get iPhone app notification to Mac computer?

I'd like an AppleScript that will rename files like these by removing the leading numbers and underscore.\nSo file names like these:\n\n5111632_The Secret_ Dare to Dream.mp4\n5099299_Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1.mp4\n5099287_Basic Instinct.mp4\n5099283_Before I Go to Sleep.mp4\n\nwould turn into:\n\nThe Secret_ Dare to Dream.mp4\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers 1.mp4\nBasic Instinct.mp4\nBefore I Go to Sleep.mp4\n\nI'm going to run it in one folder using Hazel.\n\nA: The Applescript-native way to rename files is:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theFile to (choose file)\n    set name of theFile to \"Yay\"\nend tell\n\nIf you wanted to rename every file in a folder, I'd put the files into a list and use a Repeat block on each one:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theFolder to (choose folder)\n    set folderContents to every item of theFolder\n    repeat with theFile in folderContents\n        set name of theFile to \"Yay\"\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n(This code won't actually run as-is because you can't have two files named \"Yay\", but the first does get renamed, and you get the idea.)\nThis is closer to what you want to do, but we're not quite there—you want to get the current file's name, make some changes to it, and save the new name.\nThere's a subroutine I found years ago somewhere (I can't seem to find the source now) which will get everything to the right of a certain character, such as an underscore. This makes it easy to do exactly what you want.

I don't recall this problem happening before, but over the course of the past couple of weeks (very rough approx - clould be less, could be more) I've noticed that I often hear the system alert sounds through the internal speakers.  For instance, right now, if I play music, it comes out of my headphones properly.  But if I send an email, the email sent alert sound comes out of my internal speakers.\nFor what it is worth, if I manually switch the sound to internal speakers (while the bluetooth headphones are connected), all the sounds comes from internal speakers.  And then if I switch it back to the bluetooth headphones, I am back where I started (with music coming from headphones, but email sent and calendar alert sounds coming from internal speakers).\nIs this a configuration option (i.e. allowing special sounds to bypass the sound output settings), or is something wrong?\n\nA: In System Preferences > Sound you can control the sound output from the \"Output\" tab. This is the same setting you can change from the speaker icon in the menu bar. This sets the audio device to be used for ordinary sound output such as music, games, etc.\nHowever, in System Preferences > Sound you'll also find a tab named \"Sound Effects\". Here you can set a separate audio device to be used for sound effects such as email alerts, etc.\nNote the setting \"Play sound effects through:\" - usually you will find it set to \"Selected sound output device\", but if you set it explicitly to the internal audio device, you'll get the experience you're describing.\n", "Q: Is there a way to bypass charge a 2019 MacBook Pro? Bypass charging powers the computer but it doesn't charge nor discharge the battery.\nCan I bypass charge on a 2019 MacBook Pro?\n\nA: No.  Unless you disconnect the battery from the logic board, the battery is going to be charged (managed, actually) by the SMC on the logic board.\nApple enables battery health management by default, so the need for bypass is lessened greatly.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211094\nYou can opt out of this chemical aging countermeasure if needed, and even then Apple won’t apply charge to a mostly full battery so bypass happens automatically when mostly full.\n", "Q: Why use backup if icloud is already enabled for every application iCloud Backup refers to Settings > [name] > iCloud > iCloud Backup and iCloud sync refers to iCloud > Apps using iCloud and you enable/disable iCloud for the respective applications. Have a look at this  for reference.\nI found the image online.\nI am not sure if that enable/disable for the apps (the ones displayed like Mail, Contacts, Calendars, etc) works only if the iCloud Backup is enabled.\n\nA: There’s an old adage in IT regarding backups - if it doesn’t exist in 3 different places, it doesn’t exist.\niClould backup is just one backup for your iOS device.  Ok, but you only use your iOS device with iCloud.  True, but backups get corrupted - all the time!  Having a second backup ensures that there are two different places you can get to if something disasterous happens.  Like your Internet goes down (no access to iCloud backup) and your iPhone crashed and you need to restore.  Having a local backup would easily solve that problem.\nThree places?  Sure!  You have a document on local on your iPhone, on your iCloud drive, backed up to iCloud makes three.  Having it backed up locally makes four places to gain access to that document.\nBackups are one of those things that you take for granted until you really need it.  I’ve never seen anyone complain that they had too many backups when their hard drive crashed or device was stolen.  I’ve only seen people in despair when they didn’t have any.\n\nA: Most of what iCloud does (other than iCloud Backup) is synchronize data between your various devices and the cloud. Synchronization is not a backup! Synchronization protects you in case a device is lost, fails, etc, but does nothing to protect against data being deleted or corrupted. If you delete or overwrite an important note on one of your devices, iCloud sync will promptly delete/overwrite the copy on the iCloud servers, and then do the same on all your other devices. In a situation like this, a backup would let you go back to before the problem happened, but sync copies the problem around.\n(As Allan pointed out, it's best to have multiple \"redundant\" backups -- a sync service doesn't count as one of them.)\n", "Q: iMessage without iCloud is like or unlike other messaging applications when it comes to the synchronization? If one uses the same Apple ID in more than one device and uses iMessage in each device, if iCloud > Message is disabled, ie, the iMessage sync is turned off, don't we \"receive\" a message on each device and see the \"sent\" message on each device? I am asking if it's like WhatsApp/Telegram/Messenger/etc or not. Tell me what exactly happens when you have a SIM card installed and when not, the latter being more useful since I anyway use other messaging applications at this point.\nThis is for mobile devices and not Mac.\n\nA: ICloud messaging only keep your messages in sync - it doesn’t prevent all your devices from receiving messages and that in and of itself is dependent on how you’ve configured Messages to “reach you.”  In other words, there are several ways that you can be reached - AppleID, alternate email, phone number, etc.\nIf another iOS user sends you a message via SMS, your iPhone will get it, but your Mac won’t for example (assuming sync is turned off).  However, if someone on a iDevice (iPhone or Mac) sends you a message using your AppleID, both your Mac and iPhone will get it.  However, where you initiate and respond is where you will see the conversation history.  If you reply on your phone, you will not see it on your Mac, for example.\nSo, using your example of removing the SIM card, you may receive a message if connected to WiFi and if you do and respond to it on that iOS device, you won’t see the conversation sync up on your Mac, though you may see the initial message.\nAs for how they relate to WhatsApp/Telegram/et al, it’s completely different technology. Those messaging apps do not interface with your carrier like Messages does and they are entirely self contained within the cloud.  Each client is simply a means to access the cloud based messaging service so each client, by default will be synced up.\n", "Q: Help with Disk, won’t boot I was trying to factory reset my 12” MacBook A1534.\nWent as instructed into recovery mode and clicked “erase” for the internal disk.\nWhile I erased I went with the default set, “APFS format.”\nThe computer restarted and I was left with a black screen and the flashing logo of a folder and a question mark.\nI booted back into internet recovery mode (command+R) into disk utility and I see that I am left with a drive named, “APPLE SSD AP0256J Media.”\nI then learned that I might need to reinstall El Capitan but it wouldn’t let me because it’s saying that the drive needs to be journaled.\nMy main issue here is,\nEvery time I try to journal whether it’s by partitioning, erasing, or using the command prompt, disk utility freezes and the bar doesn’t load at all. It then brings me back to the black screen with the folder and question mark. It lets me choose any other format like ExFat except journal which is the one I need.\nI also ran diskutil list and I see that I don’t have an synthesized drive anymore,\nI do not have the Macintosh HD, Preboot, Recovery, VM.\nI’m not very experienced with this stuff.\nCan someone please help.\nId hate to toss this computer and “get a new hard drive” as others have told me, on this Mac the SSD is soldiered on the board.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I am able to formate using exFat successfully but I get this message.\nI’ve tried enabling journaling via Terminal and it just freezes up when I do anything involving journaling.\n\nEDIT #2: I just tried using the (Command - Option - R) and Catalina came up, I reformatted into APFS, while loading it said it was journaling. Then the screen went black showing me a folder with a question mark. I went back into the Catalina recovery and it’s saying it is in Mac OS Extended now, but it’s not journaled and it won’t mount so I cant install catalina. I don’t believe SSD is bad because smart status says verified.\n\n\nA: It's normal to not have a Macintosh HD volume and other volumes after you've erased the disk since the disk is now empty without an operating system installed.\nIt's normal to have many little ‘disk image’ disks show up in diskutil list since that's how the Recovery environment works (diskutil list shows 20 disk partitions, I only know 3, what are the rest?).\nIt's not normal to be unable to erase a disk to enable journaling. However, journaling is only an option on HFS formatted disks, and you should be using APFS.\nIn Disk Utility, with the top-level disk selected, Erase, then enter a name like Macintosh HD, choose APFS as the format and choose GUID Partition Map for scheme. Once the disk is erased, exit Disk Utility (don't reboot, just close the app) and choose Install macOS from the recovery dialog.\n", "Q: 21.5\" Late 2012 iMac | Display or GPU issue I purchased used iMac over auction. The iMac seems to show no picture. Could this be the display pin issue or it has the like of faulty GPU?\nSince these iMacs don't have screen mirroring by default, is there any way to do that to see if its GPU or display issue. I am attaching the pictures below:\n\n\nMore then half screen is black.\n\nA: Without putting hands on, it's impossible to know for sure if it's a GPU or an LCD issue. However, a screen that has a delineated bright area and a dead area will most likely be the display panel and not the GPU.\nIt's not clear what you mean by  a \"display pin issue,\" but if you're referencing an issue with the display LVDS cable, then no, it won't be related to a faulty cable.\nIf you have another Mac available, you can put this one into Target Disk Mode and use that Mac to boot off the iMac's internal drive.  You can then configure display mirroring and remote control (VNC) so that the next time you boot the iMac (normally), you'll be able to better diagnose it\n", "Q: Downgrading 2020 13\" MacBook Pro to run macOS Mojave Can I downgrade the 2020 13\" MacBook Pro to run macOS Mojave? This is the Model Id=MacBookPro16,2 - with Quad-Core Intel Core i7 of 2.3 GHz; sold in Europe in July 2020, that comes with Catalina pre-installed.\nUnfortunately, many of my legacy software (in 32-bit) cannot be made to run under 64-bit. Some of my hardware relies on 32-bit software.\nAre there hardware components in the 2020 models, which are NOT supported in previous? If one can downgrade, would that work with a time-machine backup? or would one need a complete re-install after erasing and re-formatting the disks, from a Mojave.ova file?\n\nA: There is a startup check that prevents users from booting any version of macOS older than what was current at the time the machine was first released. As it so happens, just yesterday I wrote up a long answer on how to bypass this check: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/402727/4027.\nI encourage you to give it a read, but in short, you need to create a bootable installer, and add your computer's model and board ID to a file called \"PlatformSupport.plist\". This will allow your computer to try to boot the old OS, and either succeed or fail on its own merits.\nSo the question is, will Mojave actually function on your MacBook Pro?\nThe 2020 13\" Macbook Pros come with two types of processors. The lower-end models with fewer thunderbolt ports have 8th-gen Intel Processors, whereas the higher-end models with more ports have 10th-gen Intel Processors.\nMojave does run on other Macs with 8th-gen processors, so I think there's a good chance that this first group of MacBook Pros could run Mojave. On paper, the hardware is compatible, and someone ought to try it!\nUnfortunately, from what I can tell, I believe you have one of the higher-end models with a 10th-gen processor. I wouldn't expect that to work unless you can find or make a custom kernel—and even then I'd expect other hardware issues, similar to what I encountered.\n\nA: No, you cannot downgrade the model of MacBook that you have to run macOS Mojave. The oldest supported version of macOS for your model of MacBoo is macOS Catalina 10.15.4.\n\nA: The general rule with macOS releases is that a machine cannot run a release older than the release that is current at the time the machine is first released. For example, your machine was released when Catalina (10.15) was the current macOS release - it won't run on an older macOS release.\nThat said, some have had varying levels of success running older, unsupported releases. There are a detailed set of instructions in this answer from /u/Wowfunhappy. You may have luck doing something similar but you will almost certainly have some technical challenges.\nA far simpler approach is to install an older macOS release (eg, Mojave) in a virtual machine and use that to run your 32-bit applications. It certainly is possible with Parallels and may be possible with VMware Fusion and VirtualBox.\n\nA: To add to what has been written already: don't think about whether the Mac can run the OS -- think about whether the software can support the Mac.\nThe OS is software that contains drivers for the hardware. New hardware needs new drivers. Old OSes don't contain drivers for hardware from their future.\nRelying on software that is not currently developed is not a good place to be: you need to think now about how you can get up-to-date, and that might mean new hardware purchases.  There are alternatives, like Virtual Machines running older OS versions: but these are temporary stop-gaps.\n", "Q: parallel with copy command is very slow to clone 2 directories I am on MacOS Catalina. This command is very slow :\nparallel -j32 cp -rpf {} /Users/henry/ ::: /Volumes/henry/\nThe goal is to  clone the /Volume/henry to /Users/henry directory.\n/Volume/henry is shared across my network.\nCould anyone tell me what's wrong in my command : I have 1.3 TB to clone.\nAny help is welcome.\n\nA: The command should likely be adjusted like this:\nparallel -j32 cp -rpf {} /Users/henry/ ::: /Volumes/henry/*\nNote the asterisk, this will allow parallel to parallelize across the folders/files present to be copied within the top level of /Volumes/henry/.\nWith the above command, there will be as many concurrent copies as /Volumes/henry/* expands to, which is why the original command (without the asterisk) was slow (it was performing one parallel copy).\nHowever, since you are copying so much information, I'd recommend an alternate approach, and use rsync rather than cp. rsync might be slightly slower, but it verifies that copies complete properly, so would help guarantee that the destination matches the source, and it is resumable in case the process prematurely ends.\nSomething like this should work:\nparallel -j32 rsync -av {} /Users/henry/ ::: /Volumes/henry/*\nFinally, you may need to play around with the number of maximum threads, 32 might be too high depending on the I/O of your disks on the source and destination, and depending on how many folders/files there are in the folder /Volumes/henry/. Since this copy is network bound, 32 threads may not speed the copy up as much as is hoped.\n", "Q: App that displays real or fake busy data-visualization?

It's much better to go for a partial match, and use the various features of grep such as ignoring case (grep -i).  Further, that find operations is very, very slow.  So it's better to do it once and then use other tools to filter out the names you want.\nLog in as an admin user.   Go to Terminal.   Go\n  cd\n  sudo find / > filelist\n\nThat creates a file in your home directory called 'filelist'.  This will be quite time-consuming, but you only have to do it once.    The reason to use 'sudo' is so you can see all directories, even those your user doesn't have permission to eXplore. Note that this will expose any other user's personal filenames on this Mac.\nNow, still in terminal, and still in home directory, go\n cat filelist | grep (various query terms here, any you find useful). \n\nThis goes quite fast, so you are free to iterate on any term you think helpful.  (cat|grep so the grep phrase is at the very end of the command, so you can just hit up-arrow-backspace to change it).  I recommend starting with ZXP-Installer so...\n cat filelist | grep ZXP-Installer\n\nThis will give you a list of files and directories where part of the name includes that string. Given the uniqueness, I think you will only find files associated with it.\n", "Q: Merge missing disk partition on a Macbook I tried to install a Linux distro on a partition in my macbook, but it didn't go well so i want that partition to merge it to my main partition of the OS, but in the disk utility doesn't appear.

Most Linux versions include the gdisk command. Use this command to remove the linux partitions.\n\n\n*Boot to macOS Recovery. Basically restart the Mac and hold down the command(⌘)-R key combination. Once booted, open a Terminal application window and use the\n gpt -f remove -i N disk0\n\ncommand to remove each Linux partition. You need to replace N with the correct partition index. You can use the\n gpt -rf show disk0\n\ncommand to list the partitions. The Linux partitions have the following partition GUID type values.\n Linux Filesystem          0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4\n Linux LVM                 E6D6D379-F507-44C2-A23C-238F2A3DF928\n Linux Swap                0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F\n\n \n", "Q: Reuse Cmd+Tab for hammerspoon application switcher I set up hammerspoon and use hs.window.switcher as mentioned in the docs.

See code below. We set up a window switcher that switches between windows within the current space. mapCmdTab is a callback function for every time a key is pressed. If tab was pressed while only the cmd modifier was on, then we call switcher:next() to go to switch to the next window. Returning true means that the key press is not forwarded on to other applications (but it is if we return false or nil). If shift+command+tab was pressed, we go to the previous window. For some reason, the (capital?) tab character is string.char(25) when shift was being pressed.\nswitcher = hs.window.switcher.new(hs.window.filter.new():setCurrentSpace(true))\nfunction mapCmdTab(event)\n    local flags = event:getFlags()\n    local chars = event:getCharacters()\n    if chars == \"\\t\" and flags:containExactly{'cmd'} then\n        switcher:next()\n        return true\n    elseif chars == string.char(25) and flags:containExactly{'cmd','shift'} then\n        switcher:previous()\n        return true\n    end\nend\ntapCmdTab = hs.eventtap.new({hs.eventtap.event.types.keyDown}, mapCmdTab)\ntapCmdTab:start()\n\n", "Q: Reveal in Finder from the Terminal How do I reveal a file that I have the path for in the Terminal in Finder?

Same for any directory in /myUser/Applications.\nOr does macOS have an integrity protection for that?\n\nA: On macOS, root doesn’t play much role as any user that is an administrator functions with the same power. When you type any admin user and that admin password in a permission dialog, that makes any user  (even a non-admin user) root.\nSome apps have a script or framework to change ownership to root, others don’t change it (like when you copy an app from Downloads or a disk image)\nThe information you show makes no difference security wise. This is just permissions on a folder and package that anyone can read and execute. Other mechanisms check for known bad software and validate that parts of the application have not been tampered with.\n\nA: You can test this yourself quite easily:\nChoose an app that has myUser / admin owner and group, and try modifying it. Then do the same for one that is root/wheel.\nThe first can be modified (by myUser) without authorization. The latter requires authorization.\nSo theoretically, a malicious script running as a process of the same admin user could modify or delete such apps at will.\n@bmike is right that such modified apps may be prevented by the OS. However, as another test, I just modified some bytes of the binary file on an app, and MacOS did not prevent its launch. (The app crashed, mind, but MacOS still tried to launch it!)\nAs for apps in myUser/Applications: those files are inside the user's domain, and so there is the expectation that the user (and any user processes) should be able to write to them.\n", "Q: Option + E accent not working on Google Chrome - Macbook pro A few days ago my Macbook stopped displaying the ´ character when I use Option + e.\nThe same happens if I try to use the ´ in the keyboard viewer.\nOption u and option n work to make umlaut and tilde as expected.\nCatalina 10.15.4, input sources US and US International PC.\nEverything else is working as usual.

As far as I can tell, \"anbalagous\" isn't a real word, so I figured I must have added it to the dictionary at some point by mistake.\nHowever, it seems that \"anbalagous\" isn't in ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary, so it's a bit of a mystery. Out of curiosity, I would like to check which file the word \"anbalagous\" appears in. So:\n\n*\n\n*where are the spell check dictionary file(s) located on a Mac?\n\n\n*is there any location other than ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary where custom words are stored for the system spell checker?\n\n\n*if (as I suspect) the dictionary is stored in a binary file, is there a way to see the list of words in it?\n\n\n*(Probably not but might as well check) does a Mac's spell checker dictionary contain the word \"anbalagous\" by default?\nIn case it makes a difference I'm still on OS X 10.11.\n\nA: Through a process of elimination, I have determined that the word is (erroneously) in the system wide spell checker.\n\n*\n\n*The file isn't in your local spell check dictionary.  This is easy to check - simply edit the file ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary.  You can also issue the following command to search directly from the command line\n% grep -i anbalagous < ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple utilizes a spell checker called Hunspell which is an open source spell checker based on MySpell. (also found on https://opensource.apple.com)  The dictionary (en_US.dic) are plain text files and can easily be viewed/edited.  Issuing the following command on the downloaded dictionary file yields no results; it's not in the public dictionary from Hunspell.\n% grep anbalagous < hunspell-en_US-2019.10.06/en_US.dic\n\n\n\n*\n\n*AppleSpell appears to be their proprietary spelling and grammar checker product as it isn't found on https://opensource.apple.com/source/ (listing of open source projects used by Apple).  The version.plist file found in /System/Library/Services/AppleSpell.service/Contents makes reference to the \"ProjectName\" being \"ProofReader\".\n\n \n\n*\n\n*There are additional word lists (spelling dictionaries) found in /usr/share/dict.  Searching each one for the word in question produced no result either. Eg:\n% grep -i anbalagous < ~/usr/share/dict/words\n\n\n\n*\n\n*On a FreeBSD 12-1 VM, I installed the hunspell and en-hunspell (en-US dictionary) ports.  Anbalagous is identified as misspelled; so the hunspell engine and dictionary appear to be working.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally, on a clean install of Catalina, I tested the word anbalagous and it doesn't trigger the spell check.  It appears it's in the spell check dictionary/word list supplied from Apple or there is possibly a bug in Apple's implementation of the spell checker.\n\nSince I can't seem to find a dictionary with that misspelling and the open source tools which Apple bases their spell checker seem to function correctly, I filed a bug report with Apple at https://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html; I encourage you to do the same.\n\nA: *\n\n*You may be able to select the word in TextEdit (or other app), right click and select 'Unlearn Spelling'.\n\n\n*If the word isn't in the file LocalDictionary, is it in any other files in that folder?

I like to keep track of information with simple text files, and I'd like to push them back and forth (or synchronize them) with native iOS and macOS software.\nIs there an easy way to do this?\nHere's an example; I go to the library and on my laptop find many library book call numbers (each on a different tab in a browser).\nI glob them together, sort the call numbers in order with Python then paste back into a text file.\nThen I hold my phone up to the screen and photograph it!\nThen I can go to the stacks and check the books without carrying around my laptop.\nIf there was a printer in the library nearby, I'd print it. If lists like this were shorter, I'd just copy them down by hand.\nQuestion: How can I easily, painlessly push text files back and forth between my phone and my laptop?\n\n\n\nA: AirDrop:\n\nWith AirDrop, you can wirelessly send documents, photos, videos,\nwebsites, map locations, and more to a nearby Mac, iPhone, iPad, or\niPod touch.\n\nYou should be able to “share” the text file and select your iPhone under AirDrop.\n\nAnother option is to Copy and paste between devices:\n\nWith Universal Clipboard, you can copy text, images, photos, and\nvideos on one Apple device and then paste the content on another Apple\ndevice. For example, you can copy a recipe from your Mac and paste it\ninto a note on your nearby iPhone.\n\n\nA: \nHow can I easily, painlessly push text files back and forth between my phone and my laptop?\n\nUse the cloud...\nThis is what Cloud synchronization was designed for.  This will work with iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, et al.  Simply create a file and put it in the directory that gets synchronized with your chosen service and the file will be available on all of your devices, in real time.\nAdditionally, these services include Note taking apps and document processing apps:\n\n*\n\n*iCloud:  Notes and Pages\n\n*OneDrive:  OneNote and Word\n\n*Dropbox:  Content editing and collaboration tools.\n\nAll of these are free (OneDrive includes free web versions of OneNote, Word, Excel, etc. and 5GB of storage)  You're not limited to just text files, but if you wanted to share a text file, that can be done as well.  Additionally, you don't need to be on the same network.\nFor instance, you can be logged into a public library computer where you can cut and paste the call numbers into a text file.  Your phone, connected to the cellular network, can be  signed into your OneDrive or iCloud account and your documents/notes will sync up over it's cellular data connection.\nThe beauty of this type of solution is it's all cross platform and you can have any mix of desktop (Mac, Windows, FreeBSD/Linux) or phone (iPhone or Android) and it will work as described. If you happen you switch to a tablet, it too will have access to the document(s) in real time.\nIf your not connected to the Internet\nBluetooth File transfer would be your best best.  Apple has an excellent document detailing this.  Again, this one is platform agnostic - meaning it's not limited to Apple desktops and devices - you can have a Mac computer and an Android phone/tablet or an iPhone/iPad with a Windows, macOS, or BSD/Linux computer.\nOn macOS, you can simply enable Bluetooth Sharing in System Preferences\n\n", "Q: Upgrading RAM, iMac 27'' 2019: Is it better to mix Apple/Crucial modules, or substitute all old modules with new ones?

In iCloud preferences, there's an option called \"Optimize Mac Storage\" which says, \"The full contents of iCloud Drive will be stored on this Mac if there's enough space.\"\nJust what does \"enough space\" mean? At what point will the Mac start offloading things to iCloud?\n\nA: It's based on the available storage space of your device.  iCloud is a syncing system which means it allows you access to your files from all devices signed-in with the same Apple ID.  When you change a file on your Mac, your iPhone will show you that changed file (after the change syncs, of course). You're not changing a copy of a file, you're changing the actual file. So files are kept on your computer and are stored in Apple's Cloud.\nThis is different than a system like Dropbox in that Dropbox keeps a copy of a file online.  You can have a 64GB iPhone and 1TB in Dropbox space, there's no correlation between the two.\nTaking a sidetrack to understand iCloud better, a good explanation is provided by The Mac Observer:\n\niCloud syncs your data between your Apple devices. If you delete a file in iCloud on one device, it gets deleted on all your other devices. But that means if one device is infected with malware, and your files get messed up, they will be messed up on every iCloud-enabled Apple device.\niCloud Backup is a good start but it’s not a true backup either. This service does back up many things on your device, but it doesn’t back up data that is already in iCloud. Services like Contacts, calendars, Safari bookmarks, Apple Notes, and Messages in iCloud are not included in iCloud Backup. A true backup would back up everything.\n\nSo when you ask \"At what point will the Mac start offloading things to iCloud?\", the answer is that it always offloads some things to iCloud. You can fine-tune your storage needs vs speed in accessing files.\nOn your Mac when you select \"Optimize Storage\", it will move things like movies and TV shows that you've already watched from local iTunes storage to iCloud (freeing up some of your drive space).  You also have options to store other items, like email attachments, in iCloud.\n\nA: \nJust what does \"enough space\" mean? At what point will the Mac start offloading things to iCloud?\n\n\"Enough space\" means the space on your local drive is equal to or greater than the the cumulative size of the files stored in iCloud.  So, if you have 10GB free on your Mac and only 5GB stored in the cloud, iCloud will synchronize all 5GB to your Mac because there is \"enough space.\"\nYour Mac will offload files to iCloud based on usage not some arbitrary number of GB free/used.  If you have sufficient space on your local drive, it may not offload any at all.  Sufficient space is not a fixed number - it varies from person to person.  You may have several gigabytes of storage space free, but you cannot download the next macOS update because it exceeds your available free space - in this case, you won't have sufficient space.\nIn this Apple support document there is a section entitled Store your files in iCloud and save space on your device\nOffloading Files\n\nIf you need more space on your device, iCloud Drive can help.... your Mac keeps all of your recent files on your computer, but keeps your older ones only in iCloud, ready for you to download when you need them again.\n\nEmphasis mine\nIt will go by how recently you accessed the file, not by how large it is.  So if it can't keep things in sync because your requirements locally are larger than what you have available, it will offload the oldest files first and keep offloading until it frees up enough to continue working.  What's that number?  It depends on what you're doing and what you need.\nYou must keep in mind that iCloud can only try to help optimize space, not that it will be completely successful.  If your requirements for storage both locally and in the cloud are simply too great, you need to buy more storage.  Period.\nLocal vs Cloud Storage\nIt's also important to note that iCloud isn't an extension of your local storage. For example, if you have a 128GB drive on your Mac, and 1TB in the cloud, you don't have 1.13TB total.  iCloud is ultimately a sync service.  If you're running out of space, you need to add more whether it's a USB flash drive or you upgrade your SSD (if possible) or buy a new machine.\nThis is why it's important to purchase a machine with the storage, RAM and CPU you will need tomorrow, not what you need today.  In other words, if you think 128GB is good enough, you probably need 250GB.\n", "Q: Will using higher wattage chargers degrade iPhone battery more quickly? I’ve been using an iPhone 8 Plus for exactly 3 years and have been using the usb 5W wall charger that came with the box. I’ve never used any other charger, and has always charged by phone with 5V/1A. However, the phone seems to be charging more slowly over time, and I’m thinking to buy a replacement.\nI have iOS 14 installed, and battery health is at 80% after 3 years. (~7% decrease per year)\nWill suddenly using a third-party 12W wall charger (5V/2.4A); or any higher wattage charger of other brands; cause my 3 year-old battery to decrease in battery health at a faster rate? Should I get a battery replacement before switching to a faster charger? Also, will my phone be overheating as a result of higher wattage and amperage, and will that be a concern for an iPhone 8 Plus?\nThank you in advance for your time and answers.\n\nA: Your iPhone contains technology that is designed to control the flow of current from a charger into your battery. The charger itself - as long as it meets some generic requirements for voltage regulation and current capacity - has little or nothing to do with how your battery performs over time and usage cycles. Apple refers to their technology as \"Optimized Battery Charging\".\nThis technology is implemented using a combination of hardware and software. The hardware may be sourced by one of the large electronics manufacturing companies; Texas Instruments and Analog Devices both offer a wide variety of integrated circuits designed specifically for charging batteries. These ICs meter out the voltages and currents needed to effect optimal charging of various battery chemistries. Some of these ICs also include serial bus interfaces for communication of telemetry and commands with the \"outside world\". Ultimately, however, it is Apple's software that makes all the \"final decisions\" wrt battery management.\nApple has chosen the Lithium-Ion battery chemistry for their devices. All battery chemistries offer trade-offs; finicky charging requirements are one of the significant ones for Lithium-Ion batteries. At the risk of over-simplifying, charging a Li-Ion battery is a two-stage process: there is a constant-current charge phase, and at some point that transitions to a constant-voltage charge phase. This article offers a more detailed description of the charging process. Still more details are offered in this Technical Handbook on Lithium Ion Rechargeable Batteries. Here's an overview of the charging process:\n\nAFAIK, Apple does not publish exact figures for their batteries, but batteries in late-model iPhones are said to be ≈ 1.8 Amp-Hours. This is relevant to the OP's question because there are recommended limits to charging rates for Li-Ion batteries. Charging rates are generally quoted in terms of the battery capacity (C) in amp-hours; a charging rate of 1C would mean a charging rate of 1.8 Amps for the typical iPhone battery.\nMost recommendations for Li-Ion batteries call for a maximum charge rate of 1C. It is also frequently stated that charging below this 1C rate improves the battery longevity, reduces battery temperature, etc. I was unable to find a specifc recommendation for iPhone batteries, but it seems quite likely they would also benefit from a charge rate below 1C. One source stated:\n\nFor safety reasons, most batteries should be charged at between 0.5C and 0.7C.\n\nIf this is applied to a 5-volt wall-charger, then the most current that should be drawn is:\nImax ≤ 1.8 A-h × 0.7C = 1.2A\nAnd so anything more is likely to be unused. Whether or not it's possible to get 1.2A from a 5W wall charger will depend on its design and construction. If it's a simple transformer-rectifier, you will almost certainly be able to draw 1.2A. However, if the charger output voltage is regulated, you may or may not be able to draw that additional 200 mA. However, in either case, the only implication is that a 1.0 A limit may delay time required to reach a full charge by a small amount.\nIn Conclusion:\nAnd so, the answer to the question \"Will using higher wattage chargers degrade iPhone battery more quickly?\" is this:\n\nUnder a safe charging strategy - not much. And we don't know exactly what Apple's charging strategy is, so only Apple can answer that question definitively. However, it can be said if Apple's charging strategy is aggressive (fast-charging), then it is possible that a higher wattage charger would enable Apple to deliver greater charging currents that may be deleterious to the battery's longevity.\n\nAnother thing to consider (Warning: Apple supplicants may be triggered):\nBatteries are complex devices - chargers are not (relatively speaking at least). The veracity of this statement is underscored by Apple's mis-steps - past and present. One of the world's largest technology companies with virtually unlimited resources, and years of experience with Li-Ion battery technology has recently announced another significant battery issue:\nThis recent report in Forbes magazine will make anyone think twice about \"upgrading\" to iOS 14:\n\n...the company states the only fix is to “erase all content and settings from your iPhone”\n\nWhat's an Apple customer to do??? On one hand, Apple's advice for Maximizing Battery Life and Lifespan states the following:\n\nUpdate to the latest software\n\nBut now we see that isn't necessarily the best advice!\n\nA: No.\nThe power rating of a charger has no bearing on the life of the battery nor the consumption of power by the device.  A higher wattage charger only means it can supply up to the specified amount of current, not that it will push that amount of current to the device.\nCurrent is drawn, not pushed.\nRegardless if this is an \"intelligent\" charger like a USB charger that conforms to the Power Delivery specification (USB-3.1 or higher) or an \"old fashioned\" charger, it's the device that draws the current from the adapter.\nChargers and power adapters are rated in watts which are calculated by multiplying the voltage (how much) by amperage (how strong).\n\nFor instance, a \"quick charge\" USB phone charger outputs 5V @ 2.4A, or 12W.  If you use a laptop charger like the USB-C charger for the MacBook Pro rated at 96W, it will only draw 12W of current because that's all the phone can pull.  However, if you connect the same phone rated at 12W and connect it to a charger that only supplies 5W, either it will charge slowly or it may damage your charger and possibly your phone.\nThis is where the \"intelligence\" comes with with respect to USB-C and Power Delivery.  The new USB-C chargers will negotiate with the devices as to what can be supplied.  In the simpliest sense, the device \"asks\" for power and the charger \"responds\" with what it can deliver.  This way, the device won't draw more than the charger can supply.\nOn the old fashioned devices (non-intelligent), there's no negotiation.  The device will attempt to draw the power it needs.  If the charger has the appropriate capacity, it will supply it.  If it doesn't it might pull more current than it can handle, potentially burning up the charger and/or damaging the device itself.\nFurther Reading\nVarious forms of this question has been asked previously.  Below is a small sampling for additional reading.\n\n*\n\n*Is the Macbook 12 inch's USB-C charger interchangeable with other USB-C chargers or devices?\n\n*12V - 0,67 A USB Wall Charger for iPod Classic\n\n*Can I charge my headphones with the MacBook 12\" charger?\n\n*Other than speed, is there a reason that a 10W iPad charger shouldn't charge a new MacBook Pro 2016?\n\n*Danger of damaging 13\" macbook pro by charging it with 85w charger?\n", "Q: How to use Catalina window snapping feature? I keep reading about a window snapping feature in Catalina but I cannot for the life of me get it to work.\nFrom https://www.hellotech.com/blog/the-best-features-macos-catalina:\n\nAll you have to do is drag an app to one side of the screen. When you see a transparent box fill that side of the screen, release the mouse, and the window will resize itself. If you push the app against the right or left side of your screen, the window will fill up that half of the screen.\n...\nYou can also drag an app to any corner to make the window fill a quarter of the screen. Or you can drag an app against the top of your screen to fill the screen with that window. Finally, you can drag a window to the bottom of your screen to make the window fill the center of your screen.\n\n​\nFrom https://www.maketecheasier.com/snap-split-screen-windows-macos/:\n\nEntering snap mode is very straightforward. All you have to do is click and drag any open window to one of the four sides or four corners of your display. Once a translucent box appears, release the mouse button. The window will now automatically snap into position.\n\n​\nNo matter what I do, I cannot get this to happen. No translucent box, no snapping.\nIs there some setting I have to have enabled?\n\nA: There's no \"translucent box\" in Catalina, that was for previous versions of macOS.  To do that, you would click and hold the green button.\nCatalina uses the \"hover\" method.  Hover over the green button and you'll get a popup allowing you to select \"Full Screen,\" \"Tile Left,\" and \"Tile Right.\"\nPersonally, I've found macOS' window snapping feature a bit light on functionality.  I recently started using BetterSnapTool that allowed me to create custom snap areas anywhere on my desktops (multiple monitors).  I can even assign shortcuts so that I can snap my open windows to the preset monitor and size.  It costs $3, but (IMO) it is well worth it.\nI've tested various other window managers that didn't work for me, but you might get better mileage out of them\n\n*\n\n*Magnet ($3).  Intuitive and very useful. I couldn't use it because it conflicted with Think or Swim trading platform.\n\n\n*Spectacle (Free).  Worked well in El Capitan, however it's no longer maintained and was crashing in Catalina, though it may have also had a compatibility issue with Think or Swim.\n\n\n*Moom ($10).  Moom is short for Move and Zoom.  It works on a grid system and has the ability to remember layouts\n\n\n*Divvy ($14).  Another grid based window manager .  It allows you to \"divvy up\" your screen into snappable areas.\n\n\n*Rectangle (Free). Allows you to resize windows with keyboard shortcuts.  There's about 20 predefined shortcuts, and no way to create custom snap points/sizes.\n\n\n*Hookshot ($8).  Based on Rectangle and from the same developer.

I dont need to search recursively into sub-folders.\nIn Windows, if I am viewing a particular folder and want to search for files or folders that begin with the word \"abc\" then I type abc(not in the search box but I just type directly) and it highlights a file/folder. And then when I type \"abc\" again then it highlights the next file/folder that matches\nUsing Finder I see that only the first file/folder is highlighted. Even if I press escape and type again it only highlights the first matching file/folder. So I used the search box(command+F) to find all files/folders that begin with a particular word but this would search recursively i.e includes the sub-folders as well\nI do not have files/folders sorted alphabetically in the directory that I am viewing\nHow can I do the search in this situation?\n\nA: The find command in mac OS is quite expressive, despite the fact that Apple still ships a 2011 vintage. man find will provide a list of all the arguments and options. There are some examples near the end of the man page.\nN.B. this requires use of the Command Line Interface (CLI), so open/start/launch Terminal.app (it's located in the Utilities folder in Launchpad). If you're mac OS version is Catalina, you'll be using zsh by default; otherwise your shell will be bash. That's largely irrelevant to the answer here, but just so you know...\nI'll try to get you started based on some details in your question:\n\nI don't need to search recursively into sub-folders.\n\nUse the maxdepth option to limit your recursion depth; -maxdepth 1 doesn't go below the specified folder. You can go deeper by increasing maxdepth beyond 1.\n\nwant to search for files or folders that begin with the word \"abc\"\n\nUse the -name option (or a regular expression) to filter the results; in this case, -name \"abc*\", or if you wish the filter to be case-*insensitive* use -iname \"abc*\".\nThe type option allows you to filter your results by type; e.g. filter regular files with f, or directories with d. If you want files or directories, you may omit this option.\nAssuming the folder of interest is /Users/YourName/YourData, the command to use is as follows:\nfind /Users/YourName/YourData -iname \"abc*\" -maxdepth 1\n\nLet us know if you have questions.\n\nSome References:\n\n*\n\n*BSD man page for find\n\n\n*Know Your Tools: Linux (GNU) vs. Mac (BSD) Command Line Utilities\n\nA: In Finder you can\n\n*\n\n*type abc (quickly) to find the first match\n\n*use Cursor Down to move to the next file.

I use it as a dedicated music player.\nI can comfortably tap buttons on the screen. But sliding my finger across the screen causes irritation due to the cracked glass. I'm not really using multitouch on this device, so this is mostly fine. I can tap the buttons I need to, and scroll very carefully.\nThe only time when this is a problem is unlocking the phone.

After the update, the login screen appeared and  I enter my regular user/password but instead of login it asked the firmware\nAny idea why it asked firmware password?\n\nA: Why is the system has detected the OS as being new. Perhaps you reset the NVRAM and exposed this or disk has failed and the OS doesn’t match the stored fingerprint or the hardware just happened to fail coincidentally to what actions you took. Firmware passwords don’t prompt until you try to boot to a non-designated OS. As long as the designated disk is fine, no password is needed.\nThe passcode is stored in the machine cryptographically and the specific model year dictates what your options are now.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455\nAs long as you have a screen different than the one above, you might have an activation lock, MDM lock or just FileVault situation and then you can use the normal erase and install or password reset mechanism which is much easier to recover.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202860\n", "Q: How to reinstall a G4 iMac without CDs? I have got iMac power Mac G4 which I wanted to reinstall. I followed a Youtube video to do so, now my machine boots to a command prompt.\n\n\nHow can I proceed from here?\nPS: I don't have any install CDs/DVDs.\n\n\nA: Before you do anything, you need to obtain the install disks.  The latest version that was supported was OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard).\nI don't recommend downloading them from a torrent site or from an unknown person off the Internet.  Your best bet would be to obtain the genuine installer disks from  eBay, Craigslist, GumTree, etc.  If you have the inclination, you can attempt to install FreeBSD on that G4 (I installed it on a G5 XServe)\nDon't wipe your disk until you know you have a working installer. And even if you do have a working installer, make a backup, preferably an image using dd or another cloning tool, of that hard drive.  If things go sideways, you'll have a way to get back to a working machine.  Ideally, I would use a different drive and put the original away for safekeeping.\n\nA: If you can get hold of another Mac from the same era running a compatible OSX version, you can boot the G4 in target mode and link the two Macs with FireWire. Then use something like CarbonCopyCloner to duplicate the system etc onto the G4.\nI have done this using an Intel iMac running 10.5 as source and a G5 PowerMac as target. Since 10.5 is a \"fat\" install there was no issue with different architectures.\n", "Q: Mail.app quits unexpectedly My late-2015 iMac (with an internal 1TB SSD) runs Catalina 10.15.6, and Mail.app version 13.4 (3608.120.23.2.1). Mail.app connects to an IMAP email account; the IMAP server hosts about 4500 messages. Spam Sieve (now 2.9.39) is installed as a spam filter, and has been in place for six years. All the software is up to date.\nThe problem: for the last month or so, Mail.app quits unexpectedly, many times per day. It relaunches without difficulty, and otherwise works briskly and correctly.\nBefore this, Mail.app used to quit only occasionally, perhaps a few times a year, or less. The new quits might have begun when I updated to 10.15.6.\nAt first, the new quits did not generate the dialog asking if I wanted to send an error report to Apple. Then on Sept. 28, 2020, I updated macOS to 10.15.7. Since this update, Mail.app continues to quit frequently without apparent cause, but the quits now offer the “Report” dialog and generate a visible error report. I am not, however, tech-savvy enough to understand the error report.\nI booted into Safe Mode. The unexpected quits continued.\nI created a new test user, for Mail.app to log into my IMAP account. Mail.app connected and loaded the IMAP mails. I enabled Fast Account Switching, so the test user remains logged in. In this test user’s use, Mail.app doesn’t seem to spontaneously quit.\nThe only difference in Mail.app in my regular user account and in the test account is this: in the regular user account, Mail.app contains mailboxes that I use as local archives.  These mailboxes exist only on the iMac and aren’t synched to the IMAP server, just like the “Archive” mailboxes that Mail.app itself can create. (I created my own mailboxes as I wanted to preserve the naming and sorting. Mail.app names every Archive as \"Archive.\")\nThese on-the-iMac but non-IMAP mailboxes contain about 60,000 messages. I have used this on-the-iMac manual archiving for years, going back well before the spontaneous quits began. It doesn’t seem that the mail in these mailboxes slows down or affects Mail.app’s operation; if I’m not searching or opening an email from this storage, Mail.app isn’t paying any attention to it. I can’t identify any other Mail.app differences between my regular macOS user account, and my new test user account.\nWhat else might I try to diagnose the cause of these unexpected quits?\nUpdate: Late on October 7, I downloaded a new Catalina installer from Apple and replaced the OS. Since yesterday, Mail.app hasn't quit. I'll let it sit for awhile, maybe a week. If Mail.app is still stable, I'll post my own answer.\n\nA: Downloading and reinstalling macOS solved this issue.\nThe earlier unstable version of Mail.app was Version 13.4 (3608.120.23.2.1). The reinstalled macOS 10.15.17 now reveals Mail.app as Version 13.4 (3608.120.23.2.4). I suppose that this iteration, or perhaps some other invisible change, was responsible for the improvement.\n", "Q: Can MacOS scale 3200x1800 monitor?

I recently purchase the Corsair K68 RGB keyboard which has a common USB Type-A connector. I used OTG for USB A to USB C.\nThe first time mac detects the new device. Worked great.\nWhen I disconnected and reconnected the keyboard it only detects keys from A-Z. Not even spacebar or num keys.\nTried going to keyboard settings >> Change Keyboard Type. It does not detect my keyboard.\nIt only starts to work again when I restarted my mac. Now every time if my keyboard unplugged accidentally, I have to restart my mac.\nIs there any other way to do it without restarting macbook again and again everytime?\n\nA: The problem appears to be that you're using an On-The-Go adapter.\n\nUSB OTG introduces the concept of a device performing both master and slave roles – whenever two USB devices are connected and one of them is a USB OTG device, they establish a communication link. The device controlling the link is called the master or host, while the other is called the slave or peripheral.\n\nThe OTG adapter is designed to allow your device to switch roles of being the host or peripheral; this is necessary to connect devices such as mobile phones to devices like flash drives and keyboards because your mobile device has to be both -  a host when you plug in a keyboard and a peripheral when you plug it into a computer.\nThere's no need for this swapping of roles when you plug things into your computer as it will always be the host and whatever you plug into it will always be the peripheral.  Even your phone won't be a host to a computer.  The computer will always see it as an external device; maybe a storage device or even a camera.\nWhat you should be using is just a plain USB-C to USB-A adapter/converter - I like and have used Anker adapters due to their quality and warranty. (I have about a half dozen of these everywhere from my briefcase and my desk).  You don't need anything expensive, but make sure you get from a known brand (this is not the time to save a couple dollars).  When plugging in a sub $10 item into a $2,000+ computer, I tend err on the side of caution and go with reputable names.\n\nA: I have seen instances where USB ports stop working, but that's mostly been due to a static discharge on my part.\nIn a situation like this, the first thing I would do is see if the keyboard works without issue in another computer, with and without the OTG cable.  I would also see if you can use a different USB-A to USB-C adapter.\nAnother thing to check on is the System Profiler to see if the keyboard is being recognized properly. This way, you can try and rule out if it's the computer, the adapter, or the keyboard.\nI hope it helps.\n", "Q: Libreoffice Vanilla on Mac Has LibreOffice Vanilla been removed from the App Store?

The Photos Library seems to be a directory, but I cannot open it in Finder. I can look into it from terminal bash nd and I see several thumbnails. However, if I open Photos, there are no photos...\nActually, I have also an iPhoto Library, almost of the same size.\nBut if I click on it I get the error:\n\nCannot open migrated library. The content of the iPhoto library “iPhoto Library” has already been migrated to Photos.  Open Photos to view your library or use a compatible version of iPhoto to open this iPhoto library.\n\nI'm very very confused, I'd like to recover the photo and/or the wasted space. Could something have happened when I upgraded my Mac to MacOS Catalina?\n\nA: If you upgraded to macOS Catalina it does a number of conversions during the install and then during the first time some apps are used. In your case that would be the old (iPhoto) .photolibrary would be converted to the different (but similar) Photos Library.photolibrary format.\nAnd yes you can't just open a .photolibrary file in the Finder and yes it is a directory that macOS treats as a file. Apps are the same kind of thing, a directory (or folder) that contains all of the code, images, configurations and other things that an app needs to run.\nA .photolibrary can be opened in the Finder. To do so either Ctrl - click on the .photoslibrary file (in your Pictures folder) or, if you have your trackpad set up to right click or have a two button mouse, right-click on the file (called a \"package file\") and select \"Show Package Contents\" from the menu that pops-up.\nInside is a bunch more folders that the photos.app uses to keep track of all the pictures it catalogs. But if you look in the \"originals\" folder your pictures will be there, but with names that only photos.app understands. So you may have to go through any and all photos there to find the one(s) you need.\nAnd if you look for a \"Recently Deleted\" item in the Photos that will contain any photos that have been deleted in the last 30 days. So if a picture was deleted more than 30 days ago, it's gone.\nAnd if you want to recover all the space that the photoslibrary takes up you can just delete it. When Photos.app launches again it will create a new, empty, library.\nDoes that answer your question?\n", "Q: how to show all boot options and then hide them from rEFInd?

This assumes hidden_tags appears as a showtools option parameter in the refind.conf file. See Hiding and Displaying EFI Boot Loaders for more information.\nIf you have Hidden Tags enabled, then the following icon will appear on the tools line of rEFInd.\n\nThe default location for a rEFInd installation is the EFI/refind folder in the hidden EFI volume (disk0s1).

So macOS is in the UNIX family and can run most Linux / BSD /  Solaris software on it.\nMaybe there is a way to install macOS's desktop environment in Linux. Is there a way to do it?\nIf so, how can I do this?\nModerators, my question is not off-topic.\n\nA: It is correct that macOS runs upon the kernel named Darwin that Apple develops. Its source code is available online.\nHowever, it is not exactly a \"distribution\" of BSD:\nIf you compare it to Linux with the many distributions available, such as for example Ubuntu and Fedora Linux it's a completely different ball game here. They have a specific kernel (Linux) in common, and share a huge amount of user space programs up to and including graphical user interface components such as X, Wayland, GNOME and KDE. For example Linux distributions tend to use lots of GNU tools and the same libc.\nWhen comparing macOS to other BSDs, such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and others, you'll find that they do not have the same kernel in common, the driver interface is different, they do not to the same degree share the same user space programs, and macOS has its own graphical user interface system that is completely different from the rest. There are similarities and subsystems that enables compatibility - but it's far away from being \"a distribution\".\nThere's currently no easy way of porting the desktop environment from macOS onto Linux. The desktop environment on macOS is mostly closed source, so you basically have three types of options for running a macOS desktop environment on Linux:\n\n*\n\n*Create a system that maps the macOS ABI and APIs on to existing Linux APIs - in some ways similar to what Wine does for running Windows on Linux.\n\n\n*Do new implementations from scratch of the macOS ABIs and APIs for graphical programs, as well as new implementations of the WindowServer, Dock, Finder, etc. This is a huge undertaking.\n\n\n*Virtualisation and actually running macOS on Linux (which is basically not porting the desktop environment at all, so it probably shouldn't even be on this list).\nIn terms of practically doing any of this right now, only option 3 is practically viable with a low amount of effort and time involved.\nThere currently noone that has made any real progress into doing option 2. It will require a large team of experienced developers and a huge amount of time.\nFor option 1 there's a piece of software known as Darling, that has taken the first small steps towards this goal. The project has recently received a bit of \"public interest\" on HackerNews and other places, but it is still a very long way of from being practically useful for running the macOS desktop environment on Linux.\nFinally - if all you're looking for is basically a bit of macOS \"influence\" on your Linux desktop - you might want to look into the Linux distribution elementaryOS. It's not a macOS desktop environment, and does not use parts of Darwin or anything like that - but it takes much inspiration from the way the macOS desktop environment looks.\n\nA: You can use Gnome Desktop, which is similar to macOS, but you can make it look like Big Sur with these extensions:\n\n*\n\n*Compiz windows effect\n\n*Dynamic Panel Transparency\n\n*Frippery Move Clock\n\n*Panel OSD\n\n*User Themes\n\nthese themes:\n\n*\n\n*WhiteSur Gtk Theme\n\n*Big Sur icon theme\n\nplus some other visual elements like cursors (McMojave Cursors) and a dock (mcOS BS for Cairo Dock).\nWatch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT1RnyGJRMU for more information.\n", "Q: Ten years old nightmare to make facetime calls to South America I live in Europe. Here I have a 200/100 MBPS fiber connection that works like heaven. Never drops, almost zero issues, an an uptime rate of almost 100% through the year. They have installed a super router here, capable of 433 MBPS. Everything works very well.\nThen I have a family member in South America. She is using a DOCSYS connection. They say her connection speed is 400/200 MBPS but you know how crappy docsys technology is compared to fiber, but anyway, this is the problem.\nShe had an iPhone and iPad there, both configured with messages and facetime.\nShe is 70% computer literate.\nSituations:\n\n*\n\n*I facetime her. I listen it ringing here. She did not hear it ringing there.\n\n*I send her a message. The message stays clogged here and is not delivered.\n\nBoth problems happen if their devices are sitting there, without being used, for a while.\nIf I call her using a regular telefone, she goes to the devices, put them on airplane mode and them back to normal mode and now the calls and the messages work.\nIt is a nightmare.\nThe only thing I can think that she does is that she turns off messages and facetime over cellular when she arrives home (wifi).\nShe tells me that her phone and iPad always engage in cellular mode because they \"lose the wifi\" and because internet over cellular is expansive there, she turns cellular data off.\nThe telecom replaced her router 3 times and the current one is brand new, high speed router (2.4/5GHz).\nWhat can be wrong? This problem is a nightmare.\nAny ideas? Something in the router I can change?\n\nA: Usually telco supplied WiFi routers are not of high quality. They tend to be low cost varieties with lots of other features bundled in that are of higher priority to the telco.\nThe best way to proceed is to disable the WiFi functionality in the supplied router. If possible, also disable the routing and NAT functionality to get a bridged connection only.\nThen purchase your own router and WiFi equipment of higher quality. This also allows you to place multiple WiFi acccess point different places in the building. For example you typical want to have an access point on each floor (if it's a 2-floor house for example).\nYou can buy higher quality equipment from lots of different manufacturers. A popular choice for WiFi access points would be Ubiquity. If you do not have experience with WiFi equipment, I would recommened getting a professional to install said equipment. Around here it is very common to get offers on WiFi equipment including installation - I don't know if the same goes in that specific location in South America.\n", "Q: OS Catalina Recovery mode: \"Downloading installer information to the target volume failed\" Specs: Apple MacBook Pro 16-Inch Core i7 2.6 2019 - MVVL2LL/A* - MacBookPro16,1 - A2141 - 3347 - SSD Drive\nI just got my MBP from service, it just had a software problem preventing it from powering up, they just did a SMC reset.\nAs the computer was locked with the apple id, they sent it to me to unlock it and finish reinstalling OS Catalina.\nI'm not upgrading, the computer came with OS Catalina.\nI have to boot in recovery mode, asks for the Wi-fi password, connects, spends several minutes with the revolving globe, which I guess that is downloading the OS installer.\nAfter starting the OS install, I get the message Downloading installer information to the target volume failed.\nCan't get past that.\n\nOnly once I formatted the drive to HFS+ instead of APFS and didn't get that error message, but instead got a message about not being able to install the OS with that format.

I am trying to understand why my almost factory settings 13-inch MacBook Air 2017 with 8GB RAM available takes 2.3GB to just boot. The result is that if I start having Chrome+Dropbox+something to write any document, the machine starts swapping up to 2GB of stuff, and I really hate it, because the hard drive is indeed SSD.\n\n*\n\n*How do I manage Agents and Daemons on a MacBook? I am used to just open a whatever program that has the full list of services and tick them to enable or disable.\n\n*How come does macOS waste so much RAM?\n\nI come from Debian, so basically this sort of wall I perceive between me and the core settings of my machine is horribly frustrating. Thank you.\nEDIT:\nfirst of all, I updated from Mojave to Catalina, to see if things improved. Following suggestions in the comments, I decided to add some screenshots of the activity monitor in different conditions:\n\n\n\n\nthe four screenshots represent:\n\n*\n\n*the activity monitor right after a very plain boot (basically just the OS in I think almost factory condition)\n\n*after Dropbox app started\n\n*after I also opened Chrome with four tabs, and\n\n*Preview with two pdf's.\n\nThe pictures speak by themselves. I even tried to sum up the memory usage of Chrome and its child processes, and never goes beyond some 700MB. Most likely it also allocates something in the kernel space, and the wired memory takes 200MB more.\nAt now, it still did not start swapping, but I figured out that for some reason it places lots of stuff in the cache, and dropbox and chrome waste an incredible amount of memory for absolutely no reason (Dropbox is literally empty right now).\n\nA: Memory is meant to be used fully then, only later once you have a “problem” does the OS optimize and compress based on pressure. Everything looks excellent, as designed and well in order in your examples. Even if you have some memory swapped, that’s no performance issue in practice. Only after excessive swapping and sustained memory pressure would any any slowdown be measurable or need for remediation on macOS that have the pressure graph prominently featured in Activity Monitor.\nThe only problem (if you can call it that) is taking older articles at face value and assuming this is not correct behavior. That problem is actually an opportunity to learn how the system is designed and what signals to pay attention to now when you are tuning for performance.\nHere are some excellent places to get started on why Apple’s unix operating systems are not like others. Consider how many active hours of running OS Apple has with watchOS, tvOS, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS all running the same kernel, same scheduler, and most 24x7 and need no active tuning or management under very strict RAM budgets.\n\n*\n\n*Can I force my Mac to make better use of the inactive memory? (and I disagree with much of this - purge is bad unless you want to test and hobble all optimizations and see how slow running without cached files are until they cache in again or you reboot / tune the apps you run)\n\n*Isn't Inactive memory a waste of resources?\n\n*What is memory pressure, and how do I relieve it?\n\nA: Contrary to what you might think - macOS is actually not wasting RAM in this case.\nAs I see in your comments, you seem to be using an equation like this:\nused ram = app memory + wired + cached\nand you're using the term \"used ram\" as if it means \"spent ram\" or something like that.\nThat's actually not the case.\nIf you want to look at \"spent ram\" (i.e. RAM used for something that cannot currently be used for something else) you should not include the cached RAM in the equation!\nWhat you really want to have happen is for as much RAM as possible to be used as cache RAM. It will potentially speed up future data requests as they could potentially be fulfilled from cached instead of from the much slower disk - all while not taking up any valuable resource at all, because as soon as that RAM is needed for something else, the operating system will just use it for that something else.\nThe other part of your question is wanting to manage launch agents and daemons in order to be able to enable/disable them according to your needs from a big list. You can do this with the tool LaunchControl available from here:\nhttps://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/\n", "Q: How do you see more than the Last Opened date when an application was launched on Mac?

I will try to give you an example.\nI noticed when I launch the Calendar Application I see the following 2 processes running:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CalendarNotification.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/CalNCService.xpc/Contents/MacOS/CalNCService\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CalendarAgent.framework/Executables/CalendarAgent\n\n\nA: XPC Services\nFrom Apple's Creating XPC Services:\n\nThere are two main reasons to use XPC services: privilege separation and stability.\nStability:\nLet’s face it; applications sometimes crash. We don’t want it to happen, but it does anyway. Often, certain parts of an application are more prone to crashes than others. For example, the stability of any application with a plug-in API is inherently at the mercy of the authors of plug-ins.\nWhen one part of an application is more at risk for crashes, it can be useful to separate out the potentially unstable functionality from the core of the application. This separation lets you ensure that that, if it crashes, the rest of the application is not affected.\nPrivilege Separation:\nModern applications increasingly rely on untrusted data, such as web pages, files sent by email, and so on. This represents a growing attack vector for viruses and other malware.\nWith traditional applications, if an application becomes compromised through a buffer overflow or other security vulnerability, the attacker gains the ability to do anything that the user can do. To mitigate this risk, Mac OS X provides sandboxing—limiting what types of operations a process can perform.\nIn a sandboxed environment, you can further increase security with privilege separation—dividing an application into smaller pieces that are responsible for a part of the application’s behavior. This allows each piece to have a more restrictive sandbox than the application as a whole would require.\nOther mechanisms for dividing an application into smaller parts, such as NSTask and posix_spawn, do not let you put each part of the application in its own sandbox, so it is not possible to use them to implement privilege separation. Each XPC service has its own sandbox, so XPC services can make it easier to implement proper privilege separation.\nFor more information about sandboxing, see App Sandbox Design Guide.\n\n", "Q: How to remap a single key?

This is because dividers between pages aren't shown as they are in Notability or GoodNotes, making it easy to write over a page boundary and cut off the note when exporting the note.\nIs there any way to export the note as a continuous PDF (a la OneNote) so that text doesn't get cut off, or show page dividers in the Notes app so that the user is aware of where the page divisions are?\n\nA: If you have a Mac and an iPhone on same network the Notes on one device shows up on other.  So your notes should show up on your Mac and handwritten notes will appear as well. There is an option in Notes on a Mac to export selected note as a PDF.  When I tried this the Note apeared on 2 pages in the PDF and all the info was there.\n\nA: Often times the \"Export as PDF\" option still will cut off the ends of my drawing segments of handwritten notes, as oppose to moving the drawings to the next page, even though I chunk them out as half-iPad screen-sized drawing canvases, and divide consecutive drawings with hyphens \"-\". I have found using this chunking and dividing method, if I instead \"Print\" and then \"Save as PDF\" from the print menu I will get a PDF that does not cut off my handwritten drawing and instead moves that drawing to the next page.\n", "Q: I assigned 2 disks to TimeMachine and when 1 goes missing, TM complains, but it should seamlessly continue to use the 1 that is present? On the same USB-3.0 bus (MB-Pro Catalina, 10.15.6), I always have a 1-td HDD and sometimes have a 2-tb HDD, which is split into 1-tb partitions.\nTime Machine is set to back-up to both the 1-tb HDD and 1 of the 1-tb partitions.\n::problem:: MacOS sometimes unmounts the 2-tb HDD drive when I put it to sleep. Sometimes I leave the 2-tb disconnected for a few days because the extra TM bkup and data on the 2nd 1-tb partition is not that important. But this makes TM complain. Yet I thought TM should seamlessly just continue to use the drive it can find if it can't find the second drive in a dual drive configuration? The constant warnings make me want to change TM to only use the one reliable 1-tb drive.\nI'd really like for the 2-tb drive to stop unmounting. It is 5-years old, has been used extensively, and kept immobile on my desk.\n\nA: I have Time Capsule and Time Machine setup on my MacBook Pro.\nThe Time Capsule is always available at home. The Time Machine is only available sometimes.\nmacOS never complains about the Time Machine drive being unavailable, unless it's been like 7 days (which almost never happens).\n\nA: Apparently I'm confused... I thought that Time Machine was the software part of the backup, and Time Capsule, or a properly-formatted external drive, was the hardware part of the backup.\nAt any rate, I use two separate drives for Time Machine backups: one is a partition on an old Time Capsule WiFi AP/HDD unit, the other is a small USB drive that lives on my desk & occupies one of the USB-C ports when connected. This is how it looks on my Macbook (Catalina). It alternates between the two drives, and (I assume) would alternate between other drives if I added them:\n\nI have not seen any system-initiated unmounts while my system is sleeping, but I don't ever select Sleep from the Apple menu item - I simply close the lid. I do keep the charger connected most of the time. When I'm using the MB away from my desk, it does its backups over the WiFi to the Time Capsule, and eventually it will complain about a missing backup drive. Likewise, when I'm on travel and use the USB drive, it will complain infrequently. In either case Time Machine will continue its backups to the available drive.\nOne thing that you should check is the Options... button at the bottom of the Time Machine window. Your situation may be different, but in my case, the USB-mounted drive is excluded from backups. This was confusing to me initially as I thought that the Time Capsule partition should also be excluded. However, when I added it to the list, the system removed it immediately. Why? Not sure, but perhaps the system is programmed to automatically prevent a Time Capsule from being backed up?\n\n", "Q: YouTube videos play back at unwatchably fast rate with Safari on the latest Big Sur beta... anyone else?

Suffice it to say that a 24 minute video finishes in less than 5 seconds when I hit the Play button.  This is new with Big Sur.  I just installed beta 9 last night.  I have turned off all extensions, deleted my history, restarted Safari, all to no avail.  The problem happens with Chrome too so might be a QuickTime problem or something underlying.\n\nA: This is a commonly reported bug that occurs 'sometimes'.

Is there any advantage of installing python 3 through homebrew vs through the installer from https://www.python.org/ or vice verse (except that the installer can give me the latest version)?\nI try both and I can't find the difference.\n---- update ----\nI now gain some insights about this question.\n\n*\n\n*If I install python through the installer, the installer will modify PATH in .zprofile like following and create softlink /usr/local/bin/python3\n    # Setting PATH for Python 3.8\n    # The original version is saved in .zprofile.pysave\n    PATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin:${PATH}\"\n    export PATH\n    \n    # Setting PATH for Python 3.9\n    # The original version is saved in .zprofile.pysave\n    PATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin:${PATH}\"\n    export PATH\n\n    ls -al /usr/local/bin/python3                             \n    lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  69 11 20 11:18 /usr/local/bin/python3 -> \n    ../../../Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3\n\n\n\n*if I then install python thru brew, brew will complain. Sometimes I don't run brew install python directly but install some bottle, which installs python, e.g brew install httpie will install python, then brew complains\n\n    ...\n    ==> Caveats\n    Python has been installed as\n      /usr/local/bin/python3\n    \n    Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to\n    `python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into\n      /usr/local/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin\n\n\n\n*macOS preinstall python at /usr/bin/python & /usr/bin/python3 which remain unchanged. But since PATH is modified by the installer or brew (brew puts /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin) so preinstall python is shadowed.\n\n\n*I do find brew has an \"annoying\" feature, when brew’s Python being installed as a dependency for a bottle and then I uninstall the bottle, the brew's Python remains. For example I installed httpie and uninstalled it. But to my surprise my system python is still the one installed by httpie. It took me quite sometimes to figure out that.\n\nA: I'd say it's entirely a matter of personal preference, as to whether you like to use HomeBrew or not.\nThere was a recent post about some problem with brew python, but it may be a local issue, or have been fixed.\nPython 3 'json' module is actually corrupted\n\nA: For pure python it probably does not matter. All installations of extra modules are done using pip and you can deal with different versions of python with venv. The provision of venv and pipenv makes earlier answers less relevant as you now don't need a package manager, python now provides most of one.\nThe different installs differ when you need more complex native libraries.\nI think pip makes some simplifying assumptions about the the compilation environment. The command line can be complex. There are several other issues that can be found on this site.\nGeneral package managers like MacPorts, Homebrew and Fink are built mainly to compile C libraries. If you use them rather than pip to install complex libraries like scipy then someone else has done all the complex work for you and it should be a simple install. You can still use pip for pure python so you are not limiting the choice of libraries you use.\nHowever for the best overall management of python especially if it is your main development language I would look at Conda  package manager. This is in essence a combination of a full package manger like Macports and Homebrew but originally designed for and written in python python and also provides similar functions to the python packaging of pip and venv. You can still use pip if needed. For an even easier way you can use Anaconda which is built on conda but the install includes many of the libraries you need for data science and also graphical front end to manage the packages.\n", "Q: Can I use (interact with) Siri without light the screen? When I interact with Siri, I don't want to turn on the screen, because I don't need to read the response, I only need to hear it.

There are no configurable options to diable Siri screen dialogs.\n\nI don't want to turn on the screen, because I don't need to read the response, I only need to hear it.\n\nSiri (and Siri's developers) can't predict when you're going to read the screen or when you're only going to want to hear it.

The freeze causes visual GPU artifacts that extend beyond the game's window while consuming 1100% CPU. In Windowed Mode it is sometimes possible to force-quit Civ6 and recover system stability. I've read online that these thermal issues do not occur with top-line AMD Radeon 5600M GPU.\n\nIs there any known software fix that can prevent this catastrophic breakdown, perhaps by limiting the GPU clock's speeds?\nPersonally, I invested in this machine as a musician and a professional programmer to do live music and video performances, so if the GPU freezes in the middle of a concert, that will be unacceptable. Machine details:\n\n*\n\n*Machine: 2019 Macbook Pro 16\"\n\n*Processor: 2.3Ghz 8-core i9-9880H\n\n*GPU: 8GB AMD Radeon 5500M\n\n*View Mode: Full Screen or Windowed\n\n*Graphics Detail: Low to Ultra. Seems to happen faster at Ultra.\n\n*Displays: No external displays.\n\nSuspected causes in order of likelihood:\n\n*\n\n*Flawed Thermal Design on MBP16. My machine idles at 70-85degC out-of-the-box.\n\n*Badly applied Thermal CPU Paste at Apple's factory\n\n*Faulty AMD Radeon 5500M drivers\n\n*Faulty 5500M Hardware (GPU)\n\n*A bug in Civ6. Unlikely because this should not cause visual artifacts outside of the game.\n\nIn the meantime, I am in a battle with Apple to replace my £3200 Macbook Semi-Pro.\nHere is a related question, but mine should not be considered a duplicate.\n\nA: I wrote a answer to a similar question; it comes down to the design of the MacBook in relation to the thermal requirements of the CPU and GPU.\nSo, as to your suspects, I concur that poor thermal design being right there at the top.  As for poor application of thermal paste, it may be a factor, but even the most perfect application of the most efficient thermal paste will only account for a minuscule improvement in heat transfer.\nI don't believe it's faulty drivers - could they be more efficient?  Sure, what couldn't?  I also don't believe that you have a faulty GPU, however, the way to confirm that is to benchmark the GPU.  Essentially stress test it to see if it fails.\nCould it be a bug in Civ6?  That's likely as well.\nAs for the reliability of the machine to do the job, I believe you'll be fine for what you bought it for - programming and music.  These machines are very popular for both of those tasks and personal experience with using a Mac in audio recording/production found that even lower end Macs with ample memory and no GPU were up to the task.\nI find that MacBook computers (and most laptops for that matter) aren't the appropriate platform for games.  There's a reason most of the gaming rigs you see are desktop builds with ridiculous cooling mechanisms at the forefront.  In fact, I've seen a 2012 iMac (which is essentially a MacBook Pro in a desktop config) outperform a 2015 MacBook pro with essentially the same specs.  The iMac was able to run it's CPU at a higher speed for longer because it remained cooler longer.\nBottom line:  You should be safe with your Mac for work purposes and if you want to game, I'd build a gaming rig.  Besides, it's just pragmatic to keep your recreation off of the device that pays the bills, but that's just my philosophy so YMMV.\n\nA: Everyone needs to submit a bug report according to this link.\nhttps://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049626712-Why-is-Civilization-VI-is-freezing-mid-game-\n", "Q: Macbook pro 16inches 2019 fails to reinstall catalina on recovery mode after erasing hard drive, and T2 chip dissallows to boot from external drive hope you can help me here.

It's more than a broken screen. There's a problem with the logic board.  I'd like to sell it for parts, but I'm concerned about the data that is still on the hard drive.  I don't know whether it's encrypted.\nIt appears to boot up, but the touch bar only displays the ESC key, suggesting that the problem is deeper than just the display or its controller. Apple has offered to repair this for $1500, which is more than the repaired computer would be worth.\nI tried booting in target disk mode, but this doesn't seem to be working, but without a screen, it's hard to know what's up.\n\n*\n\n*Is there way to log on to the computer (say via a USB C cable) so that I can delete any data on the SSD?\n\n\n*Is this something that can be done at the Genius Bar?\n\n\n*Or, is the value of this thing so low that I should just trash it?\n\nA: If this were the 2018 model, you could \"trash\" it and not worry (too much at least)  about your data (there's actually some vulnerabilities, but that's for another day and another question).  The T2 chip would make it virtually impossible for anyone to access it.  If you encrypted your drive, then you're essentially protected from bad actors trying to steal your data.\nBooting in Target Disk Mode\nIf you boot your computer from an \"off\" state, just hold down T for about 30 seconds - that should be enough time to allow your Mac to enter TDM.  Normally, you'd see a USB icon on the screen, but now you're forced to guess; 30 seconds should be sufficient.\nOnce the target is started, boot your \"good\" Mac using the \"bad\" one as the startup disk.  You should then be able to get in and wipe out your data.\nGenius Bar\nThis is something the folks at Apple can assist with. Your particular model had something called a \"Lifeboat\" circuit integrated with the SSD.  You could literally have a dead MacBook logic board, but with a Data Migration Tool kit you could access the SSD to recover your data.  It's an expensive tool, so it's not DIY, but Apple and 3rd party repair shops would have this so they could offer the service.\nDoes it have value?\nAs unlikely as it might seem, your machine still has value.  Apple makes it impossible to obtain certain chips like the SMC.  It's made by Texas Instruments (TI), under an exclusivity contract; nobody can buy it in the open market.  So, if an SMC dies, the board repair companies cannot buy the component to fix.  So, they use donor boards for this type of repair.\nNormally, donor boards were sold as complete units.  Now, they are literally being \"carved up\" like a Thanksgiving turkey - a wing here, a thigh there, etc.  (Seriously, not kidding).  If you want to sell off your board, remove the logic board and put a drill through the solid state drive.  That will ensure that your data is secure.  They wouldn't be able to use that component anyway due to the security, but it doesn't hurt to take it one step further.  For a \"map\" of where the SSD is, just take a look at the iFixit Teardown for your model.\nGet a second opinion\nBefore you trash it, have someone who specializes in board repair take a look at it.  Rossman Repair in NYC does this and is considered one of the best (not affiliated, just a happy customer).  Without putting hands on, I obviously can't give you a budgetary quote, but you could conceivably get this repaired for less than $500 USD (guessing here).  It doesn't hurt to get a second opinion.  The plus side here is if it's not worth repairing, they can recover your data for you.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2020 Fan Issues I recently purchased a MacBook Pro 2020 13\" (1.4 GHz, 8GB Ram, i5). For some reason, when I open Chrome and watch Twitch my computers fans turn on and go crazy. After opening Activity Monitor, I noticed that Google Chrome Helper (Renderer) uses around 50-80% of my CPU.\nAlso, sometimes when I run code on my MacBook Pro, the fans turn on when the program is compiling/running but slow down a few minutes after terminating the program. Also, when watching Twice on Safari, the fans don't come on. However, around 50-60% of the CPU is still being used.\nShould I be concerned about the CPU usage (I am nervous because I only recently purchased the laptop)?\n\nA: \nShould I be concerned about the CPU usage (I am nervous because I only recently purchased the laptop)? I am nervous because I only recently purchased the laptop)\n\nNervous?  No.\nFrom a hardware (damage) perspective, your Mac and the CPU itself is designed to protect itself from overheating.  It will kick in the fans, then throttle things back and finally, if it must, it will shut itself off.  Your risk of doing damage to your machine is virtually nil.\nFrom a software perspective, I wouldn't worry either.  It sounds like your Mac is doing what it's supposed to do which is turn on the fans during high intensity CPU activity (compiling code) or watching video (GPU).  That said, I would probably look at something else besides Chrome as it's a known resource hog and not very \"kind\" to memory or CPU utilization.\nIt's also important to remember that the 13\" MacBook Pro doesn't have a discrete GPU so it's the CPU that's going to be doing all of the graphic rendering and it will use up to 1.5GB of RAM as video memory (Intel Integrated Graphics Chipset).  So, if you're compiling code and watching HD or 4K videos simultaneously, you could be maxing out your hardware.\nSo, it is possible you undersized your Mac for your needs, so from a value perspective, I would defiantly look at that.  If you're still within your return period, it's something you should make a priority to evaluate.\n", "Q: Top row on keyboard has a different behavior when pressing alt and using a non mac keyboard I use a MacBook Pro as a Laptop and mainly Linux to work. Mostly i like to use the same Keyboard (Ducky one 2 SF) for both devices. I chose the same keyboard settings (German) in Mac OS as in all other Systems. My Problem is, that the top row on mac doesn't work as expected. It still works as if I use a Magic keyboard.\nFor example, I want to get [ with alt 8, but instead I get {.\nOne solution would be to remap all the different keys, which doesn't look as the best way for me. Is there any way to just use the natural keyboard layout of my selected keyboard?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources and make sure the only item on the list is \"German Standard\" (and not \"German\").\nThe Apple \"German\" input source puts [ ] { } on alt 5689, while the German Standard input source should put them on alt 8970, and there are various other differences, such as @ being on alt L for \"German\" instead of on alt Q for \"German Standard\".\nBecause the differences are on the alt level, the printing on an Apple \"German\" keyboard can look the same as that on a \"German Standard\" keyboard, except perhaps for where @ appears as the 3rd item on a key. So it is easy to choose the wrong input source.\n", "Q: Using Visual Studio Code on MacOS \"Error: No default engine was specified and no extension was provided.\" Scenario/Setup:\n\n*\n\n*MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6 with new install of VSCode 1.50.0\n\n*Following/running VSCode Node Tutorial from:   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial\n\n*Jump to \"Express Application\" section\n\n*\n\n*install Express as directed using npm install -g express-generator\n\n*build app as directed using express myExpressApp --view pug\n\n*run app using npm start but app / web server fails to run with error in terminal\n\n\n\nError:\n\nError: No default engine was specified and no extension was provided.\n\nSystem Details:\n\n*\n\n*New install of VSCode 1.50.1\n\n\n\n*MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6\n\n\nA: Seems that pug view rendering engine NOT INSTALLED locally as a depency, even though I installed Express globally with npm install -g express-generator\nFix\n\n*\n\n*run a terminal window, or press CTRL-`(backtick) from inside of Visual Studio Code\n\n*cd into your project directory/folder - or already there if launched the terminal from VSCode (previous step)... from there run these commands:\n\n*\n\n*install pug as a local dependency with npm install pug\n\n*for EXTRA good measure, re-install express locally with: npm install express\n\n*ensure all dependencies are installed and updated using: npm install\n\n*relaunch your application with:   npm start\n\n*test/view your application at: http://localhost:3000\n", "Q: How to disable notifications from automated \"shortcuts\"?

What is AEServer in the macOS Accessibility permissions panel?\nSystem Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility > AEServer\n\nWhy is AEServer requesting to control my computer via accessibility APIs?\nShould Accessibility permission be granted for AEServer?\n\n\nA: As benwiggy already said, AEServer is a background process that processes incoming AppleEvents from remote Macs.\nAppleEvents are the underlying technology used by the Apple Event Manager, which is in turn used by e.g. AppleScript to communicate with applications and processes.\nStarting with macOS 10.15 Catalina, remote AppleEvents have additional security requirements: The user account sending the remote events has to be the same as the one receiving them. More details in the release notes.\nTo turn off this restriction and revert to pre-10.15 behavior, you can use the following Terminal command:\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.AEServer RestrictAccessToUserSession -bool false\n\n\nA: AEServer is the Apple Events Server. It is used to control Apple Events that come in from other Macs.\nCheck System Preferences > Sharing to see whether Remote Apple Events is turned on.\nAs to whether it should be running and given permission: that depends on what you do with your Mac.\nDo you control this Mac from other Macs?\nIf you turn off Remote Apple Events and don't grant AEServer accessibility permissions, then I dare say something will complain or not work if it needs it.\n", "Q: How can I make all animations instant?

Is there any way to customise the rEFInd bootloader to set a custom nvram variable, either in refind.conf or any other way? Specifically, I'd like to set a value for the boot-args variable.\nIt seems like an obvious/standard thing that someone might want to do, and I know that the OpenCore bootloader has a whole NVRAM configuration section to support it, but there doesn't seem to be anything in the docs about it for rEFInd.\n\nA: rEFInd will not let you set an arbitrary NVRAM variable directly but you can use EDK2 to compile a small EFI driver. This is described in the WikiLeaks document EFI Basics: NVRAM Variables\nEFI drivers placed in rEFInd driver directory are loaded and run automatically - see The rEFInd Boot Manager: Using EFI Drivers.  Alternatively you could write a EFI program rather than driver and then use a manual stanza in rEFInd to call a shell script to call this and then the bootloader.\nAnother (probably easier) method would be to modify rEFInd.  You can see in the source how it sets the csr-active-config NVRAM variable to turn SIP on and off - apple.h defines the GUID:\n// The constants related to Apple's System Integrity Protection (SIP)....\n#define CSR_GUID { 0x7c436110, 0xab2a, 0x4bbb, { 0xa8, 0x80, 0xfe, 0x41, 0x99, 0x5c, 0x9f, 0x82 } };\n\napple.c calls the EfivarSetRaw() function in lib.c\nStatus = EfivarSetRaw(&CsrGuid, L\"csr-active-config\", (CHAR8 *) &TargetCsr, 4, TRUE);\nif (Status == EFI_SUCCESS)\n    RecordgCsrStatus(TargetCsr, TRUE);\nelse\n    SPrint(gCsrStatus, 255, L\" Error setting System Integrity Protection code.\");\n\nOther NVRAM updates could be made in the same way - there are various other GUID listed in the WikiLeaks link in the first paragraph.\n\nIf you want to pass a boot argument without updating NVRAM you can create a manual boot entry in rEFInd and specify the options in refind.conf.  Additional options can be added using add_options - see the Creating Manual Boot Stanzas page of the documentation.\nFor example you can define submenu options like this and pick between them using F2 at boot.\nmenuentry \"Catalina\" {\n    # Get loader GUID from macOS subvolume: diskutil info disk1s5|grep 'Volume UUID'\n    icon \\EFI\\refind\\themes\\colourful\\myicons\\os_mac_silver.png\n    volume \"Preboot\"\n    loader \\3B4B18C9-C57D-4F98-9168-C8D8B9F06EAD\\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\boot.efi\n    submenuentry \"Verbose\" {\n        add_options \"-v\"\n    }\n    submenuentry \"Single User\" {\n        add_options \"-v -s\"\n    }\n    submenuentry \"Safe Mode\" {\n        add_options \"-v -x\"\n    }\n    submenuentry \"Recovery\" {\n        volume \"Recovery\"\n        loader \\3B4B18C9-C57D-4F98-9168-C8D8B9F06EAD\\boot.efi\n    }\n}\n\n", "Q: How can I make the Facebook app forget everything? If I delete the Facebook app, it asks me whether I want to delete only the app or also its data. Even if I confirm that I want to delete both but, if I re-download the app, it remembers all my previous accounts. This happens regardless of me providing any identifiable information to the App: at second download the app already recognize my device at startup\nSo some data obviously didn't get deleted. How can I remove all traces the Facebook app leaves so that it starts afresh after a reinstall?\n\nA: The reason this happens is that deleting app and data deletes only the actual app and the data files it left in its sandbox. This leaves out the information the app has stored in the iOS Keychain. This information is not deleted when an app is deleted.\nThere could be many reasons why Apple chose to do it this way. For example a large company could have several different apps in a group relying on the same Keychain data - for example Facebook also makes apps like Creator Studio, Portal and Facebook Gaming. If deleting one app deleted the Keychain data as well, the other apps might stop working contrary to what a user might expect.\nIn an earlier beta release of iOS, Apple did actually experiment with deleting the Keychain data when deleting an app - trying to preserve Keychain data only when other apps in the same group were installed. This lead to confusion for some users as to when the Keychain data was actually deleted - as well as frustration for some users that were used to deleting apps to \"save space temporarily\" and relied on reinstalling them also making them automatically login again. The change was reverted and never went into the actual iOS release.\nAs a user there's unfortunately no general way to delete the Keychain data of a specific app. You can only wipe the whole device to delete everything by opening Settings, tap General, then Reset and then Erase All Content and Settings. Beware that this will delete everything on the devices - not just Facebook or the Keychain.\nRemember to take care if you're syncing your Keychain across multiple devices using iCloud.\n", "Q: iPhone is stuck in Recovery Mode with full storage I was trying to update my iPhone X (GSM) from iOS 12.3.1 to iOS 14.0.1\nThe following steps was carried:\n1- Downloading the latest firmware ipsw (size 4.61 GB) from\niPhone10,3,iPhone10,6_14.0.1_18A393_Restore.ipsw from ipsw.me\n2- Downloading the latest iTunes on my Windows 10 PC\n3- Connecting the iPhone by an original USB cable to my PC\n4- Locating my iPhone\nand pressing \"Shift\" button from my keyboard and pressing on the\nUpdate from iTunes\n5- Selected the ipsw which was previously\ndownloaded.\n6- During in the middle of the update, an error came out\nwith a code # 14.\n7- My iPhone got stuck permanently on the iTunes\nlogo\n8- Tried for several times to exit the Recovery Mode by\nPressing and quickly release the Volume Up button.

And it worked like a charm!\nIs there any reason the newer MacBook Air would cause a problem?\nP.S - to troubleshoot this better, I connected the MacBook Air 2020 with a monitor that supports HDMI with the Multiport Adapter and an HDMI cable - and it worked smoothly without any flickering.\n\nA: Using two or more adapters in series is not recommended. While not dangerous, they rarely work, or at best, work badly. Find the right adapter for your needs.\nI've used this Belkin adapter and this one, to connect different USB-C Apple laptops to a small selection of VGA-only monitors.\n", "Q: How can I control font of the Finder's sidebar? In the finder, there is a sidebar that includes things like Favorites for easy access.  On my laptop running Catalina, the font size is much larger than I desire on my 4K screen for the sidebar.\nWhere can I control the font size used by the sidebar?\n\nA: Sidebar text size cannot be adjusted independently. However, this setting:\n  System Preferences > General > Sidebar Icon Size\n\nchanges the size of the Sidebar icons and text names.\n", "Q: iPhone - how to disable Shake for undoing read/unread email?

Since I have been doing that, I have no problem accessing files from my iPad/iMac/PC.\n\nA: There appears to be a bug in macOS which prevent data syncing over iCloud sometimes.\nA workaround is to create a new file/folder under Desktop or Documents folder to trigger the sync. You can delete the temp file/folder immediately.\nThis is a manual hack to force a sync if the automated sync is failing.\n", "Q: Resolution scaling and performance When I put the scaling setting of my screen on setting 4 on the scale of \"Larger Text\" (1) and \"More Space\" (5), system report says this:\nDisplays:\n PHL BDM4350:\n  Resolution:   6400 x 3600\n  UI Looks like:    3200 x 1800 @ 60 Hz\n  Framebuffer Depth:    30-Bit Colour (ARGB2101010)\n\nWhen I put it on setting 5 on the scale of \"Larger Text\" (1) and \"More Space\" (5), system report says this:\nDisplays:\n PHL BDM4350:\n  Resolution:   3840x2160 (2160p/4K UHD 1 - Ultra High Definition)\n  UI Looks like:    3840 x 2160 @ 60 Hz\n  Framebuffer Depth:    30-Bit Colour (ARGB2101010)\n\nI have two questions:\n\n*\n\n*My screen is 4k, and has less than 6400 x 3600 pixels. Is my screen not running at the optimal resolution, or is the graphics card doing additional resizing?\n\n*Would my laptop be performing better if it is running at 3840 x 2160 pixels and then increasing font size a bit?\n\n\nA: Question 1:\nIn both cases the display is running at the same actual resolution (3840x2160). However, the graphics are rendered virtually at a resolution of 6400x3600 before being downsampled to the actual resolution.\nThis is done because 3200x1800 is not an integer multiple of the actual resolution, therefore there's going to be some compromises made regarding image quality when viewing it on screen. In order to make the right compromises, the display is rendered virtually to a much higher resolution that is then downsampled to the actual resolution. This enables the computer to use those extra bits of display data to choose a better pixel value for each position on the display, than if it just had a 3840x2160 virtual rendering to work with.\nQuestion 2:\nYes, I think that is the case here.\n", "Q: Is there a mouse that supports tapping as a left click? I am looking for more movement leeway and thinking of using a mouse with my MacBook. But physically pressing a mouse key to left click is not that nice an experience after the trackpad. Is there a macOS supporting mouse that accepts tapping as a left click on it (just like in the trackpad)? Would the upcoming magic mouse models support this feature?\n\nA: There is software called BetterTouchTool that allows you to customise input devices, including to add \"tap to click\" to a MacBook Trackpad or Magic Mouse.\n", "Q: How to switch focus to the application that opens the link/file from an email? At some of point in the past I changed some setting in system preferences on my mac.\nSince then, when I click on a link or double click on an attached pdf, the focus does not shift to the application that opened the link or file.\nEarlier it would switch to the desktop in which the application was running.\nHow do I go back to the earlier behaviour/setting?\nI am on macOS Catalina 10.15.6.\n\nA: I found the solution, albeit it was an answer to a different question.\nThis fixed another problem I was having wherein I had to click on an application in the dock, twice, to switch to it. This is now fixed. I ran the following commands\ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool YES\n\nthen restart the Dock with the command:\nkillall Dock\n\n", "Q: How do I bypass the battery using command keys on MacBook Pro 2017 How do I bypass the battery using command keys on MacBook Pro 2017 which has a non-removable battery to run only on power cable?\n\nA: It's unclear why the command keys are specified as the mechanism to disable/bypass the battery - there are many features and functions on your Mac that aren't implemented with the command keys or any of the modifier keys for that matter.  For instance you can hold Caps Lock to switch languages or hold a letter to get it's dialects (i.e. press and hold U for ü as in Über)\nThat said, command keys or not, you cannot bypass the battery to only run on AC; period.  This core question has been asked already:\n\n*\n\n*Force USB C MacBook to run off AC power\n\n*Is there a way to bypass charge a 2019 MacBook Pro?\nIt basically comes down to how the MacBook was engineered - since the battery is no longer removable, it must be managed by the system and in response to market demand, Apple has implemented further management with Battery Health Management.  Additionally, to get the full performance of your MacBook, it will utilize both power from the mains and the battery.\n\nA: It is not possible to bypass the battery by using command keys, or any other software activated way on a MacBook Pro. The battery will always be part of the pathway.\n", "Q: Where does an iPhone store the number of failed password entries? Background:\nRecently I changed my password on my iPhone. I opted for an alphanumeric one for security. However thanks to the likes of FaceId I did not have to re-enter it for a while to the point where I could no longer fully remember it. Eventually FaceId failed me and I was locked out. I tried various combinations of the passphrase that I did remember but to no avail. I searched the internet for an answer but found nothing more than a lot of blogspam articles, a forensic tool designed for governments with a price range in the four digits, and a bunch of shady websites, trying to sell me something.\nFrustrated with the lack of useful information I opted for restoring from a backup. However all of this got me thinking:\nThought process:\nIf I knew where an iPhone stores the number of wrong entries I could use tools like checkra1n to access that particular file and alter it to reset the counter for false entries.\nThe iPhone cannot store this information with the rest of the user content as that part is encrypted, so it must be stored with information that is available at boot and hence accessible when rooting via checkra1n.\nHowever the lack of public tools implies that accessing the number failed password entries is non-trivial. I could imagine the possibility of storing it in hardware, hence making it impossible to reset via jailbreaking but the existence of tools like GrayKey implies that there is some way to extract information out of the phone that allows you test password entries against it.\nQuestion:\nSo my question is, is the location in which the number of failed passcode entries is stored known or are there at least hints that allow us to (roughly) deduce its location?\n\nA: The number of failed passcode entries is stored within the Secure Enclave in the hardware. It is not stored as a file or anything like that on the Flash drive.\nYou cannot easily manipulate it.\n", "Q: iOS & iCloud File Aliases? Anyone have any luck using iCloud file aliases with iOS Files?? Seems the aliases created on the Mac are nothing more than nearly empty text files that are useless in iOS?\n\nA: An alias is merely a shortcut to another file or folder, so it doesn't have any \"file size\" other than what is sufficient to create the alias.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13 will not recognize battery and will not charge after battery replacement Did not start my MacBook Pro 13 for 5 weeks. when I tried it was completely dead and would not start up even with charger on it. I ordered a new battery and now it works when pugged into charger but won't charge. Shows battery at 0%. it is like it doesn't recognize the battery and I have reset and still does nothing for the charging aspect. as soon as I pull charging cable out of port it goes dead again\n\nA: I assume this an old-style (pre-unibody) Mac with a removable/user-replaceable battery pack... If so, contact the seller; you could have been shipped a dud. If it's an aftermarket, non-apple product, you should also visually check to make sure it fits properly, and that all the contacts  are clean, undamaged, and seem to be connecting. As I remember from doing the same thing, some of those 3rd-party packs were less than perfectly machined.\n", "Q: Attach unique attachment to email using apple script to send email to different users I'm new to apple script:\nDoes anyone have an example of using an AppleScript to send individual emails with unique attachments for each email using an excel list?

This introduces a significant delay when first running a new executable. It's very annoying when developing code because the executables are almost always new.\nIs there any way to disable this check without disabling SIP?\n\nA: Aha, I didn't find a way to disable it system-wide for all apps, but you can disable it for specific apps in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Developer Tools\n\n\nA: You can disable Apple Mobile File Integrity by restarting your Mac into Recovery mode (hold Cmd-R while booting), and then run the following commands in a Terminal:\ncsrutil disable\nnvram boot-args=\"amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1\"\n\nThen reboot your Mac and the delays should be gone.\n", "Q: iPhone 11 erratic airplane mode My iPhone turns airplane mode on or off randomly. I put AM on at bedtime and get awakened by alerts in the night.Do I have to start my iPhone 11 off to get some sleep?\n\nA: Switching off communications modes from the lock screen panel is overridden by the OS each night - they wil be back on in the morning, though I'm not certain what time they trigger.\nYou can avoid this by using Do Not Disturb instead.\nSettings > Do Not Disturb. You can set it manually or on a schedule.\n", "Q: why does find / rm tells me it doesn't find a folder after it found it?

Thus when you reach step 3 and try to descend into the folder, it is already gone - giving you the \"No such file or directory\" warning.\nIn reality find works in a bit more complicated way, but the above is detailed enough to understand what happens here.\nAll in all the command will work like you want it to, but you'll get these extra warnings. You can make them go away by adding a -maxdepth 2 option to the command if you know that your directory structure always has the bin folder at that level, or you can use the -prune action to not ensure that the search does not descend into the bin folders.\n", "Q: Can't print - 'Backend' failed Using a MBP running Catalina 10.15.6 I am unable to print to a networked Xerox printer.  It discovers it just fine with Bonjour, connects, but when I print anything, it instantly pauses the printer, and in the printer job list dialog, it fails saying Ready to Print - 'Backend' failed, 2 pages.\nI've tried re-adding the printer, Reset the printing system with the right-click in the printer list, rebooting the machine.  I have an old iMac also running 10.15.6 which can print to it, so I know the printer works.  Any other ideas?\n\nA: I figured out a workaround.  (Of course after struggling with this for weeks, I figure it out just after posting the question.)\nWhen adding the printer, the dialog asks for \"Name\", \"Location\" and \"Use\".  \"Use\" defaults to \"Secure AirPrint\", but changing this to \"AirPrint\" fixes the problem.  It's a Xerox printer, FWIW.\n", "Q: How do I delete xpcproxy executable from /usr/libexec folder on my Mac? How do I delete xpcproxy executable from /usr/libexec folder on my Mac? When I dragged it to Trash, it did not delete, neither was Command+Shift+Del helpful\n\nA: You don't say why you want to delete it, so I'll assume you know what you're doing.\n/usr/libexec is a folder for programs that are used by other programs. xpcproxy is owned by root, and so you'll need at least root privileges (typically via sudo) to delete it.\nIn addition, you may have Apple's System Integrity Protection if your OS is fairly recent vintage. If you have SIP, you'll need to disable it before you can delete this file. THere are numerous guides (like this one for Catalina) explaining how to disable SIP, so I won't repeat them here.\n", "Q: Protective film for iPad 10.2 I have a 10.2\" iPad with the apple pencil.

I was considering to buy a protective film, and I have two questions:\n\n*\n\n*does it have a bad impact on the writing experience?\n\n*if I don't use it, will my screen deteriorate in time?\n\n\nA: A protective film will have an impact on the writing experience. If it is enough to notice as \"bad\" is really subjective.\nI don't think you need to worry at all about your screen deteriorating from the use of the Apple Pencil.

Before I delete iMovie and GarageBand on a shared MacBook Pro (I'm the admin), if I upgrade from MacOS Catalina 10.15.7 to Big Sur (whenever it launches), will they auto-restore on Big Sur being installed?\nI know that if I want to reinstall I can do so via App Store, this question is more about the workings of Mac OS X.\nIf I remove GarageBand and iMovie from my MacBook Air, can I restore them later? was the question I saw which related to this.\nMy question is not about should I delete them, but whether these will be automatically re-installed anyway on upgrade from new OS (I'm not talking incremental, e.g. from 10.15.7 to 10.15.8, but to a completely new OS).\n\nA: *\n\n*I would expect automatic installs of apps like Garage Band and iMovie not happening when Big Sur is released.\n\n*I would plan on these being easy reinstalls from the App Store.\n\nThe iLife and iWork apps are not part of the OS. Apple pre-installs them when you buy a new Mac which can lead people to assume they are part of the OS.  You need to download them again from the App Store if you wipe a machine and only install macOS.\nThis has been how it works for every release leading up to Big Sur so unless Apple makes a late change, count on signing in to the App Store to download any apps you don’t migrate from a previous backup.\n\nA: Because I use Logic Pro, I have no need of Garageband and it is not on my disks. I have updated my OS several times (Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur) and Garageband has not been reinstalled by the OS.\n", "Q: Any DynDNS client for current iOS for usage with nsupdate.info? This is my first question here and my first experience with iOS. As a long-time Windows and Linux user, I have been asked to install a client (updater) for the dynamic DNS service nsupdate.info on a phone with iOS (current version).\nI have researched the situation and came across RealDNS and some others, but none of them seems to be intended to work with nsupdate.info.\nOn Windows, it is the same, but I solved the problem there just by writing a script which performs the updates and which is triggered by the task scheduler on a regular basis.\nBut unfortunately, I don't have Apple's development tools, and I have no clue whether I could run a script on iOS at all, so I can't develop something myself. Plus, I have no knowledge of how to develop software for iOS (including scripts).\nCould somebody help me out there? As a last resort, I could look into the list of providers RealDNS supports, and use one of these services.

I've got a 500 page Pages ('09 v4.3 on OS X 10.12.6) document where all text is 14 point; I want to change to 12. The problem is that there are blocks of italic text throughout. Using Select all to change to 12 point of course changes all the italic text to normal. How can change the document font size to 12 but retain the italics? Could Applescript parse the document and change the font size and retain the italics?\n\nA: I'm not quite sure what you're doing to affect the italics. Changing one aspect should not change any other.\nSelect all text. Multi-style selections will show as Multiple in the style box. In the Text tab click the size button… all else is retained except the font size.\nWindow shrunk to only show relevant area…\n\nIf your text already has multiple font sizes, meaning the point size box is greyed out, then use  Cmd ⌘   and  +  or  -  which will change all by one point at a time, maintaining relative sizes.\nIf you use that box in this instance, all type will be set to the same font size, breaking the relationship.\n\n", "Q: Understanding my panic report Macpro, Mid 2010, 12 core, 96GB memory, Running 10.10.5\nI am seeing a restart, i.e. coming back to the Mac having rebooted itself, every few days.

Apple has released a new, smaller version of their speaker: HomePod mini.\n\nOne of my complaints with the original HomePod was its use of a proprietary power cable connector, which made it difficult to replace or shorten the cable. Most other Apple devices use industry-standard C7 \"figure 8\" power cables for mains wall power, or a USB-C or Lightning cable plus a power adapter.\nWhat type of power cord does the HomePod mini use?\n\nA: The Apple sales page does not contain a single photo of the power cord. It's as if they want you to think it doesn't have one...\nI used that page's \"AR\" feature on my iPhone to view a virtual version of the HomePod mini on my table. I had to walk around to the other side of the table, then took a screenshot.\nThe AR HomePod mini appears to use the same round, proprietary, non-removable power cable as the original HomePod.\n\n\nA: The cable length is six feet and it’s powered by the same small 20 W adapter as the iPad Pro ship with. Same size as the older 18 W adapter which will not work except to give an awesome safe red glow to the orb. So the mini has a cable fixed in the orb, that ends in a USB-C connector.\nThe adapter directly  plugs into the wall 20 W USB-C adapters\n\nThe tech specs say 20 W power adapter and the published efficiencies table lists 100 / 115 / 230 V input.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review\nTwo things to remember, all cords are removable and all machines generate smoke if you are sufficiently equipped and motivated.\n\n\nA: I feel the need to post this as an answer, even though it's really just a frame challenge.\nLate edit*\nAs it appears the Homepod will come with a power adaptor, the job just got even cheaper, if just as simple.\nClip the cable anywhere it will be out of sight & join with a bit of terminal block, 50p from any DIY store.\n\nIt's designed for mains voltages, but to comply with regs, would need to be encased in a supporting/insulating block for 110/240v. For low-voltage DC you can leave it in the open, or wrap in a bit of insulating tape if you're a bit paranoid wary.\nYou're going to need to do this to get the cable through any inconspicuous hole in your desk/wall/ceiling anyway. If the plug at one end is proprietary or even a standard small-form figure-8, it's going to be much harder to achieve, plus user-fit figure 8s are more bulky than their moulded counterparts.\nReplacing a standard mains plug is little more than a 5-minute job for anyone with an elementary skill-set. It will almost certainly be a double-insulated structure, so you've only two wires to get right. Brown live, blue neutral.\n\nA: The HomePod mini was quickly opened up after release:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/18/homepod-mini-teardown-reveals-nearly-impossible-repairs-and-non-removable-power-cord/\n\nCord details:\n\n*\n\n*6ft Power Cord.\n\n*Non-removable, unlike the original HomePod, which could be yanked from the unit with a hard tug.\n\n*USB-C on the wall-end.\n\n*Ships with a 20W USB-C Power Adapter.\n\n\nA: The cord is semi (hard tug) non removable from the side of the HomePod mini. On the other side, it is a USB-C plug.

Dual External Monitors on a (late) 2017 MacBook Pro mentioned:\n\n\nMonitor A: Connected to mini-DisplayPort port Monitor B: Connected to\ndaisy-chain Thunderbolt 3 port\n\nI am not sure what is meaned with B.\nCould I also connect each screen with one of the TB3 of the dock? If yes, would a TB3 -> HDMI or TB3 -> DP cable lead to a better result?\nThis question is similar to Dual 4K monitors with 2017 Macbook Pro base model, however more specific.\n\nA: In regards to question 1: Yes, it should work perfectly fine for those purposes. I use the same dock and similar 4K monitors with several setups here with the 2017 15\" MacBook Pro without any flicker issues or similar. It should be the same for the 13\" model.\nIn regards to question 2: The dock has a mini-DisplayPort port as well as a Thunderbolt 3 port for display output. The monitor has HDMI as well as DisplayPort inputs.\nI would recommend using a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable for one monitor, and a Thunderbolt 3 (i.e. USB-C connector) to DisplayPort cable for the other monitor. I use these cables myself.\nThe meaning of \"B\" is that one Thunderbolt 3 port on the dock is used to connect to the laptop, the other Thunderbolt 3 port is connected to the monitor so it is \"daisy-chained\". Essentially this just means that the monitor signal for the monitor travel through the Thunderbolt cable from the computer to the dock, and is then passed on from the dock to the monitor.\n", "Q: New Apple nfc door opener as seen on iPhone 12 keynote video? \nAnyone has info about this technology?

I generally type in American English and MacOS's regional settings are U.S.\nUntil today, the keyboard worked with US-standard key mappings even though the keys are printed with UK-standard keys. For example, on the UK keyboard the @ is to the right of the colon instead of the single/double-quote button; on a US keyboard, @ is on the numeral 2.\n\n*\n\n*My input source is still set to US-english -- https://share.getcloudapp.com/Z4uyqxpp\n\n*The keyboard type is set as US-ANSI.\n\nI've re-paired, re-booted, etc. In other words, my system settings no longer seem to override the physical keyboard settings. The keys are still showing up as the UK mappings in both MacOS and Windows (I'm dual-boot). Again, I changed nothing today; something must have updated and now it doesn't work and I can no longer effectively type. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Okay, I ran into the same problem today and think I found a fix (leaving this out for anybody who stumbles into this thread later).\nThe problem was to do with the different modes on the keyboard. My keyboard, under q, w, and e (in blue, fn key), has iOS, Android, and Win as optional buttons to press. It seems the keyboard had defaulted to the wrong version, possibly due to running out of battery. I struggled with this for a few hours, before it turned out that pressing Fn+e (Win) resulted in the keyboard returning to its UK layout and behaving normally. I believe it was on the iOS setting, which defaults to a US keyboard for some bizarre reason.\nHope this helps (although I realise this is now long in the past).\n", "Q: How can I monitor MacBook USB bandwidth? I have a late 2017 MacBook with the latest Catalina. Using two Anker USB extenders, I have devices in pretty much every port, including six large external hard drives, a webcam and an external SD card. I suspect that somehow I have maxed out my i/o on this machine which slows to a crawl 5 times a day.\nWhat I need to know is whether there is some equivalent to lsblk or some utility I can use to monitor USB bandwidth in real time. How do I know whether or not I am maxing out my i/o and whether or not that is impacting other things?\n\nA: It’s highly unlikely USB can slow down your mac since it has a minimum of 2x Thunderbolt 3 ports and likely 4 of them. The bandwidth there is way more than USB could saturate. It’s much more likely you need to look at the OS and apps running and rule out interference or USB cable / hub issues with some troubleshooting to note exactly what’s connected and do some timed measurements of whatever you care about when the response is normal and then when the response is slow.\nA quick check of System Information should show you the USB speeds for each device and as long as they are the same when it’s fast and when it’s slow, you can know to look for things that change - and not worry USB is somehow intermittently slowing down.\n", "Q: Pages: rotate existing, wide table by 90 degrees so that the rows are now vertical possible? (equations in several cells) I have a complex table in Pages 8.2.1 and several cells have equation objects in them. The table has gotten too wide and I want to rotate it by 90 degrees.\nFrom what I understand I can't rotate one page by 90 degrees, but Apple discussions post says (to a question asked March 2018):\n\nWe assume you are using Pages 5/6/7 because you can rotate Tables in Pages '08 or '09.\n\nI haven't figured out how.\nI found this: Pages '09 Hacks: lInsert pages at landscape format but a) I don't have version 9 yet and 2) I don't understand what it's saying.

Also, be aware that this is a bit of a hack, your mileage may vary.\nNote: It may be best to start with a new document or a copy of your current document to be safe.\nSelect Document to reveal the Document sidebar.\n\nNext, untick the Document body checkbox.

Ive got an iPhone 64gb running iOS 14\nThe storage is almost full and i noticed that Whatsapp is taking up almost 15gb. Most of this is photos / video from group chats etc.\nI dont want to loose the photos and videos, but at the same time i dont want to store them locally on my phone, is there a way i can store them in iCloud ? Ideally i dont want to store the photos / videos to my camera roll, but would like to just unload some of the whatsapp data to the cloud.\nI also need to backup the chats themselves for future reference as some of the chats are for business purposes.\nI think there is a feature in whatsapp where you can export a chat / group inc the messages and media, but my phone is so full with whatsapp i cant even export this data as there is no space free to export it too !\n\nA: What i think the best solution is: Go to Whatsapp -> Settings -> Chats. Enable Save to camera roll. From now, all your incoming photos and videos will be saved automatically into your Photo app. The name of the album with the saved photos and videos is called WhatsApp. But the incoming photos and videos are also saved locally in the WhatsaApp app.\nSo now you should enable iCloud Photos in Settings -> Your Name -> iCloud -> Photos. All your photo albums will be backupped in the iCloud. It is not possible to backup one specific album.\nAfter the iCloud backup, the photos and videos are still saved locally on your phone in your WhatsApp app. To delete this, go to WhatsApp -> Settings -> Data and storage usage -> Storage usage and choose a chat. From here you are able to delete the media which is stored locally in the WhatsApp app.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no way to do this. You can only import all your media to camera roll, and then group them manually into albums which you can name like the group the photos came from, and then delete them from WhatsApp. By this you free the storage as the photos will be stored in iCloud, and you can still associate them to the group. When the porblem occurs again, you just have to put the new photos in the albums, that should be less work than the first time.\n", "Q: Is it possible to compile UNIX command line program for Apple Silicon architecture on Intel-based Mac? I have a GUI wrapper of UNIX command line program.  I noticed that Apple announced Apple Silicon Mac.  Sooner or later I need to build Universal Binary of my GUI wrapper.  But at first, I need to build UNIX command line program for Apple Silicon.  Currently I only have Intel-based Mac. Is it possible to compile UNIX command line program for Apple Silicon architecture on Intel-based Mac?\nNote: I know Apple provides Apple Silicon Mac mini for $500, but I don't have the a money now.\n\nA: The whole point of Universal Binaries is that you can compile the same code for 2 architectures, one of which (by necessity) is not the hardware you're running.\nIt has previously been possible to compile Universal Binaries for PPC and Intel, or 32-bit and 64-bit, regardless of the hardware doing the compiling.\nApple's documentation on porting to Apple Silicon (AS) is here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/porting_your_macos_apps_to_apple_silicon\nNote the diagram which has the words \"Any Mac computer\".\n\nThe Apple Silicon Mac mini is for developers to test that their AS code (and Apple's) runs well. There are no AS Macs available for purchase by non-developers (as of 14th October).\nApple has said that Intel binaries will run on Apple Silicon using Rosetta 2 emulation. So you will have at least the life-span of Big Sur before you need to create a Universal Binary.\nI'd say you don't need to worry about this until:\na) AS Macs have been released,\nb) people who have bought AS Macs are interested in your tool;\nc) Xcode 12 is officially released (along with Big Sur)\nat which time, compiling a Universal Binary for a command line tool should be pretty straightforward, just by changing some options.\n\nA: The process of building a binary for a different architecture than the one you're running is called cross compilation.\nAs highlighted by the other answers, this is a relatively common occurence, especially in the history of Apple which switched from 68K processors to Power PC, then to Intel, and now to ARM.\nMind you, anyone building an app for iPhone or iPad on their Mac has been cross-compiling, as those already use ARM architecture while their Mac currently uses the Intel architecture. It's even common to build multi-architecture iOS apps, as various CPU versions actually use different variants of the ARM architecture (armv7, armv8...).\nLikewise, it's common to build i386 (Intel 32-bit) and amd64/x64 (Intel 64-bit) variants, either independently or as fat/universal binaries.\nThe process for cross-compiling and building fat/universal binaries depends a lot on the environment and toolchain you use. If you use Xcode, then it's going to be a matter of changing project settings, and voilà!, it's done.\nIf you are using Unix-type tools (mostly on the command line), including make or variants, gcc or clang, etc, then it may require more or less tinkering of your build process to achieve all that, with quite a few options to change (architecture, but also header files and libraries locations), as well as adding the step which combines the multiple architecture-dependent binaries into a single fat/universal binary.\nSo it all really depends on your current build process and the tools you use. But it will definitely be possible.\nOf course, this is all based on the code to compile actually being portable, i.e. not making assumptions about things (like integer or pointer sizes) and not requiring any assembler code. That used to be a big issue in the past (especially with pure C code), but nowadays with the number of architectures software is currently built for, it's much less common to encounter issues with this.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to compile UNIX command line program for Apple Silicon architecture on Intel-based Mac?\n\nYes, it is.\nIt's a broad answer and depending on your particular specifics you will need to tweak/adapt your code as necessary.\nHow do we know this?  History is our guide and it's not limited to Apple.\n\n*\n\n*OS X was compiled on PowerPC then migrated to Intel\n\n*OS X was derived from NeXTStep which originally ran on Motorola 6000, then Intel, Sparc, and RISC-PA\n\n*Open Source operating systems like FreeBSD are (re)compiled for different platforms including i386, AMD64, IA64, Sparc64 and ARM\n\n*On a personal note, I've compiled XOrg (FreeBSD) to run on an XServe G4.\n\nSwitching architectures isn't as daunting as it sounds.  Apple will make the tools (XCode) and development hardware available (as you've already mentioned). From a purely business perspective, they have to.  Delivering a new OS and literally starting with an App marketplace of virtually zero would be the surest way to kill your product line.\nYou will have the tools - whether it's from Apple (XCode) or from the Open Source community.  The hardware will become more available which will ultimately lower the cost and depending on your market strategy, you may not have to worry about this until a few years after Apple Silicon has been official released due to market adoption rates.\n", "Q: Bluetooth Explorer removed from Xcode Tools in 12.x? Apple's Additonal Tools for Xcode package includes a great set of tools that are useful even for non-developers. One of these  is Bluetooth Explorer, which, among other things, can help enable the hidden higher-quality AptX audio codec for paired devices.\nI noticed this tool is now absent from the 12.0 disk image. Additional_Tools_for_Xcode_11.4.dmg contains the tool, but Additional_Tools_for_Xcode_12.dmg does not.\nAnyone know if this means it's gone for good?\n\n\nA: Not only it's been removed, I've tried to use the Bluetooth Explorer for Xcode 11.4 and it's not functional.\nI believe it is part of Apple's new changes of making their prperietary chips, M1  and thereafter,  part of a single ecosystem where if the iPhone and iPhone don't support other chips, like intel and Qualcom, then the OS XI won't neither.\n", "Q: How to block specific apps on an iPhone I'm having a hard time configuring my daughter's iPhone with Screen time.\nI would like to completely block some apps during the weekdays and allow some time for them during the weekends.\nScreen time only allows me to set a limit strictly greater than 0, so I have to set all the apps I want to block to 1 minute. Knowing that she can auto-extend for 1 additional minute, an app that I want blocked has instead 2 minutes of usage per day (not a big deal but still...). There is a \"Always Allowed apps\" list but not a \"Never Allowed apps\" list. Uninstalling the apps is also not a solution as I want them available during the weekend.\nIs there a way, with Screen time or another app, to have a better control and put in place what is described above?\n\nA: You might want to consider using Jamf NOW which is a more robust and versatile way of locking down and managing iOS (and other) devices. We use the Jamf Edu MDM at my school to manage > 300 iOS and > 900 laptop devices.\nBest of all, the first 3 devices you manage are FREE!\nDisclaimer: satisfied user of Jamf: no financial or other ties.\n\nA: A possible solution is to use the Downtime function exactly opposite  for what it was designed.  Downtime was to basically turn off applications with the exception of a select few for critical needs to make the user want to put down the phone and go do something else.  In other words, lock down the phone.\nIn computer security (especially firewalls), we take this approach as well, lock everything down and only enable or allow the bare minimum.  So, in this case, make your \"operational hours\" your \"downtime.\"  Create the iOS downtime schedule and map it to when you want your child to only have access to the apps needed for education.  This will, by default, block out recreation and social activities, etc.  Since in (iOS) downtime, you can specify the contact(s) that can be called and/or messaged, your child won't be without the ability to reach someone important.  All of the apps you want to be utilized can be used and none of the ones you don't will have access.\nNext, set time limits for the apps you want to be able to be used when (iOS) downtime is off.  Since it will be during the \"recreational\" time, an extra minute here or there won't cause too much consternation.\nIt can be frustrating when Apple seems to implement something only half baked like to use App schedule based time restrictions, of either having a restriction with at least 1 minute or having no schedule at all.  This is definitely something you want to leave Apple Feedback but hopefully this workaround gets you to (or closer to) what you need.\n", "Q: Accessing my school admin's username & password to un-install the securly certificate on MacBook Air Well, I've been having a lot of issues with Securly recently, as it's been blocking me from every site that I wanted to go on, like pixilart.com. Anyway, it just says that \"it's not allowed by the school restrictions\". The reason for pixilart.com to be blocked is because \"it's a social media platform\". However, it's a social media platform for all ages. Plus, it blocks ALL VPNs, but it doesn't explain why it was blocked. Anyway, it blocking all free non-download VPNs so that no one can get by without being noticed by Securly.\nHow can I overcome the restrictions or un-install Securly?\n\nA: Basically you can't overcome the restrictions set by Securly (or any other such tool). You should approach the school administration if\n\n*\n\n*you are blocked from doing work mandated by the school\n\n*this is your personal device and you want to have the restrictions removed\n\n\nA: I want to add this in here as a word of caution.\nAs someone who has written acceptable use policies for educational establishments, there are \"boiler plate\" provisions (meaning pretty standard across the entire industry) that you're going to find that you've agreed to even if you don't remember agreeing to them:\n\n*\n\n*Use of an identity/password other than the user's own is prohibited.\n\n*Any use of telecommunication services or networks for illegal,  inappropriate...shall be prohibited.  Illegal  activities shall be  defined as a violation of local, state, and/or federal laws.  Inappropriate use shall be defined as a violation of the intended use\n\n*Users shall not intentionally spread computer viruses, vandalize the data, infiltrate  systems, damage  hardware or software, or in any way degrade or disrupt the use of the network.\n\n*Students  and/or  employees  using  School  equipment  or  property,  on-site or off-site, must conform to the requirements of this policy.\n\nI emphasized some of the more relevant phrases, but they are not to be taken out of context. \nIt surprises most students and parents (some employees as well) that they agreed to this.  Even if they didn't provide a signature on the acceptable use policy, because we have (electronically) an affirmation of consent and acknowledgement when the user first signs on to the computer (in other words, they have to read all of that and click \"I agree\"), they are ultimately bound by the rules.\nThe rules are so written that no matter where you are or what you intent is, trying to circumvent security will put you in a position of deep consequence.    Depending on how strict (or vindictive) your school administrators are, it could be considered a criminal activity.  Depending on your state, provincial or even national government, doing this could be a crime.\nMy (non-legal, but you'd be hard pressed to find a lawyer who disagrees) adivse to you is Don't Do It!.  If you really need social network, ask your parents or save up for a cheap laptop or tablet.  This is not the fight you want to have because you simply can't win and the consequences are too great.\n", "Q: 5GHz capable drivers for BCM94360CS on Windows 7 \nBackground\n\nI'm running Windows 7 via bootcamp on my early 2015 Macbook Pro (via a separate guide: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/guide-install-windows-7-in-macbook-pro-early-2015-with-almost-fully-support-include-track-pad.1992139/) and had to jump through many hurdles to get this working.\nEverything works well for the most part other than the wifi.\nMy card is a Broadcom BCM94360CS; I've tried numerous drivers but almost ALL of them don't work whatsoever. The only one that worked for me was the Chinese driver listed in the guide above (direct link to driver: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxq--onVE9j5T1dNY3BlRWxEZms/view?usp=sharing).\n\nThe Problem\n\nWhilst the driver works, it's connection speed and overall stability is quite terrible and it does not seem to support 5GHz networks (there is not even an option in the settings; other devices on the same networks have also had much faster speeds by comparison).\nSince this is a Wifi driver issue, I was hoping somebody could kindly provide a stable driver capable of faster speeds and / or assist me in editing the INF file to enable such functionality.\n\nI don't have any experience editing INFs or anything like that but I managed to get my unsupported 2015 Mac stable on Windows 7 so I feel I'm somewhat tech savvy if anyone has any advice.\nAdmittedly, I'm not even sure if I installed the drivers correctly the first time but nonetheless, spamming F8 to disable driver signature reinforcement when I boot up isn't such a big deal.\nAs for why I have to stick to Windows 7, it's related to compatibility with a programme needed for school. Windows 10 is simply not an option at the moment so don't waste your breath telling me to upgrade lol.\n\nThank you!\n\nA: The problem is that you're looking for drivers for a wireless adapter that was pretty much only on Apple devices* for an Operating System that reached End of Mainstream Support January 15th, 2015.  It went completely EOL (End of Life) in January of 2020.\nYour 2015 MacBook Pro was literally released the same time, if not shortly after Windows 7 was deprecated for Windows 8.  Apple, nor Microsoft were going to spend development cycles writing a driver for it - this is why it's so rare.\nSupposedly, Boot Camp 6 drivers might work for you.  However, there's no tweaking of INF files that will increase throughput - that's a function of how the driver was written.  INF files are what describe to the Windows installer what the driver name and location is, the device name and location, and what registry options to be added/modified during install.  None of it \"fixes\" a problematic driver.\nI understand that Windows 7 is critical for you, however, it's odd that a school would require you to utilize a tool that only runs on an OS that's been dead for 5 years now.  Your next option would be Windows 8, which might have better compatibility.  Windows 10 does have Compatibility Mode which allows older software designed to run on Windows 7/8 to run on Windows 10.\nNow, if this is something you've personally decided that you only want to run Win7 and/or this particular application, then you'll need to make some compromises on your end as it's extremely unlikely you'll see any development on this driver for Windows 7.\nFinally, your last option is to run the App in a VM rather than in Boot Camp.  As it runs in virtualized environment with virtualized network adapters, you won't have any compatibility issues with respect to drivers.\n\n* https://deviwiki.com/wiki/Broadcom_BCM94360CS\n", "Q: Dell E2720HS flickering as external MacBook Pro monitor I have an MBP 2012 model.

TL;DR How can I have a permanent profile for my Xcode-developped app on my own iPhone so that I could use it without having to rebuild it from Xcode every 6 days, likely by issuing myself the needed certificat and provisioning files ?\n\nI'm an aspiring iOS developer and have built my first app, using the tools and language proposed by Apple (Xcode, Swift, SwiftUI).  Works fine in Xcode and on my iPhone. I'm quite happy with it.\nHowever after 6 days, the app stops working on the iPhone; the iPhone needs to be reconnected to my Mac and the app needs to be rebuilt from Xcode, then it works again.\nI understand that this comes from the provisioning profile being managed by Xcode and being temporary (6 days).\nI understand enlisting in Apple Developer Program would be a workaround, but I find it quite abusive to be forced to pay 99€ per year to use and tune my own app on my own device.\nI even read an old post saying that if I enlisted, my app would cease to work within a year if I delisted from the program. This is certainly not advertised loudly by Apple !\nI understand they may be issues protecting the apple store monopoly, and hence apple business model, but I find it quite at odds with Apple official PR that promotes learning kids to develop and at the same time is preventing anyone to be able to use the programs freely for themselves.\nSo I would like to understand if this is a mandatory policy from Apple, or if I am missing something about managing provisioning profiles (sofar a total black box to me).\nTo be crystal clear, if there is a workaround, I believe it is about bypassing Xcode managing the certification process and creating myself the needed authorizations : development certificate for developer approval and permanent provisioning profile for my authorized device.\nI make the hypothesis that it is not possible nor practical not to use Apple solutions, and that the problem is actually independent from the use of Xcode.\nTo rephrase it, my problem is :\nIs it possible to develop an iOS application for my own use without having to pay 99$/year ?\nAnd my understanding of path to solution is :\nHow can I have a permanent profile for my Xcode-developped app on my own iPhone ?\nPrecision :\nI am not trying to launch a heated debate on jailbreaking, nor on the app store guidelines. I just want to understand wether in the current Apple ecosystem, if I want some applications of my own with me, I need to pay several hundreds of dollars in the next years to have the possibility to do it.\nEdit 07/10/2022:\nFrom what I understand, as of today, the answer is no, you can't use Apple tools, namely Xcode + Swift, to develop and use freely your own application even if it's only on your own Apple device. There is no workaround that would allow you to have a permanent certificat (more like annual IRL) for your own code.\nSee details of my answer here:\nXcode 7 develop for iOS without developer account\nThere is however an exception if you're part of an eligible organisation.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/\nBut in the intended specific case of this post, an individual who would like to hobby around only for his personal use, the answer stays no.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to develop an iOS application for my own use without having to pay 99$/year ?\n\nNo, it is not currently possible to develop and maintain an iOS application without being an Apple Developer Member. The end user of the application does not affect this.\nPlease let Apple know if you disagree with their approach.\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*Xcode 7 develop for iOS without developer account\n\n*Remotely distribute an iOS app compiled in Xcode 7 without App Store, developer program sub, or jailbreak?\n\nA: You don’t need a paid developer account to compile and run your own code on your own devices, so even though you’re chafing at the time limits on builds, it’s totally free.\nApple now waives the fee for accredited non profit and educational groups. This includes App Store distribution of free apps.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/\nI understand for some $100 is a fair trade off, but for others paying Apple to provide all the tools and code for apps that can run a longer time on iOS. isn’t of value.\nThe other way to develop without paying Apple is to use your own tools, and not Xcode. Python, shell, web apps, all sorts of interpreted code and widget apps exist now, as do cloud based solutions that compile down to native code and avoid paying Apple directly. This does need a jailbreak on your part if they can’t provide you the certificates / signed binaries needed to install the app in a way that works.\nYour “I need a signed profile” request is the technical term for jailbreaking unless you intend to obtain Apple’s signing keys or rent / borrow someone else’s credentials who has payed to develop.\n", "Q: Dock unread count is inaccurate Every couple of days Mail.app stops showing the unread message count on the Dock icon. Restarting the application brings it back immediately.\nIn Preferences->General, I have Dock unread count linked to a smart mailbox that excludes a handful of folders.\nIs this a known issue, and is there a fix?\nUPDATE:\nThe problem just recurred, and I notice that when I open the smart mailboxes list, the mailbox I have Dock unread count linked to also doesn't show an unread count, even though viewing the smart mailbox contents has some messages marked as unread.\nSo the problem seems to be related to how unread counts are calculated for smart mailboxes.\nUPDATE 2:\nI've reopened the question. Things were going pretty well for a few days with the solution I posted in the answer. But today I'm seeing the opposite problem: the Dock count is 3, but there are no unread messages in any of the folders that are supposed to be counted. When I view the smart mailbox, it's empty. And marking messages as unread adds them to the smart mailbox, but the badge in the dock doesn't change.\nAs in the past, restarting Mail corrects it.\n\nA: I think I might have found a solution.\nI added the following condition to the smart mailbox that the unread count is linked to:\n\nMessage is unread\n\nBefore I made this change, I noticed a significant lag between marking/unmarking read messages and the unread count on the smart mailbox and the dock badge changing.

How often and under what conditions are files under var/folders/ removed?\nIf an application creates a file under var/folders/, is it possible for that file to be removed by the system before the application quits?\n\nHere's a related question, but it's 10 years old and refers to /tmp and not var/folders: https://superuser.com/questions/187071/in-macos-how-often-is-tmp-deleted\n\nA: It depends on the type of files created:\nFor files that the application has created as temporary files, they're up for removal when they have not been accessed for 3 days.\nFor files that the application has created as cache files, they're not normally automatically removed. Instead they can be removed when performing a safe boot (hold down the shift key while booting your Mac).\nAnd no, as long as the application keeps the create file open (i.e. it has a reference to the file descriptor), it should never be the case that the  file is removed from the file system before the application quits.\nNote that application can and do work with files that are not visible for a regular user. I.e. if your application opens a file and keeps it open, the user can delete the file and it will disappear from directory listings - however the file is still there and the contents can be accessed by the application without problems. When the application closes the file (or the application is closed) - the file is permanently deleted from the file system.\nAs mentioned in the comment (oct. 16th, 2020) the above is documented in the manual page for confstr.

I use Windows as my main environment and wish to use iMessage on Windows.  Is there anything that will allow me to just have a published app instead having to do a full Remote (VNC) session?\n\nA: You could say that the X11 system for macOS supports something similar to RemoteApp - i.e. allows you to run an app on a distant server and it shows up on your desktop like any other app in its own window - without a full desktop environment like VNC.\nHowever you cannot run the Messages app this way.\nThe only solution I can think of that comes near to what you want is to run macOS in a virtual machine on your Windows computer, and then use features in the virtualisation software to show each guest application in its own host window. In VMWare this is known as \"Unity mode\", however VMware currently only supports that mode for Windows guests. In the theoretical case that a later VMware version supports this, remember to check that your for macOS at that time allows you to run the operating system on Windows.\n", "Q: Maps on iPhone gives me completely wrong distance estimates Let's say I look up \"Coffee Shops\". It gives me a list of coffee shops around and their distances. But when I choose a coffee shop and press on it, it gives me a completely different distance.\nFor example, one of the coffee shops in the initial list Maps shows me is supposedly at a distance of 700m. However when I \"click\" on that coffee shop, it then shows a distance of 2km (almost 3 times more).\nWhy is this happening?\n\nA: This is just a speculation and based on observation, but it seems that Maps will use the last place the iPhone \"checked in\" as point where it thinks you are to calculate distances.\nWhen you click/tap on the specific entry, it then gets the actual GPS coordinates to then draw the map/calculate directions.\nThe way I solved the issue was to search for my place of interest in Bing (yeah, the Bing App) because it gets the actual GPS coordinates, runs the search, and then hands off to Apple Maps.\n", "Q: Image Capture doesn't complete photo deletion on phone This issue has created a lot of frustration, so I'm hoping someone here might have the answer.

The photos don't delete. When I restart Image Capture, the supposedly deleted photos reappear!\nI'm using an iPhone 11 running iOS 14.0.1. I'm connected to a 2018 Mac Mini running 10.15.7. I'm also having the same issue on a 2015 iMac running 10.15.7 and a similar problem on an equivalent photo management program on a Windows machine, so the problem must be in my phone.\nI've tried USB-A and USB-C cables and all the available USB ports. I've erased the phone and set it up as a new machine. The issue occurred even on a newly installed operating system with no other programs. It's infuriating.\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\nJim\n\nA: I've had this issue before.

When running iTerm2 / Tmux, I have this cursor:\n\nbut when I hold the alt/option key, I have this cursor:\n\nwhat is the difference?\n\nA: Normally when you for example select a piece of text in iTerm2, your mouse activity is reported to the application you're currently running (for example a text editor). That application decides what happens.\nHowever, when you hold down the alt/option key in iTerm2, you disable mouse reporting. This means that the application is not told of your mouse movements, and instead everything takes place inside iTerm2.\nThis can be used if for example you want to select and copy a piece of text to the macOS clipboard, but the application you're running does not allow you to do so (i.e. it has some other behavior triggrered by the mouse).\n", "Q: Is it possible to see the running timer on the lock screen in iOS 14?

Technically, an iPhone is just another node on the network.\n\nIt appears that the tool will not be able to reach an iPhone behind a firewall. Is this assumption true?\n\nIt depends on how you configure the firewall.  The screen shot you posted \"says\" you've forward a number of ports, some of those related to Facetime.  For the record, you need to forward ports 53, 80, 443, 4080, 5223, and 16393-16472  (UDP).\nThe question is, where did you forward the ports to?  If nothing responds, whatever tool you use will assume the ports are not open.  Think of it as calling a phone number.  Whether or not the number is blocked, if the person at the other end doesn't pick up, do you know if they are home?\nThere's nothing in that screen shot that tells us how the port forwarding is configured.  It's just a list of ports at this point.\n\nThe person on the other side is using a tool like \"what is my ip\" to see their IP and I am using that, plus a port on that list to test.\n\nCongratulations.  You just added your IP to a database of IPs that have some sort of web service running on it - in other words, an attack point.   If you're going to do a port scan, use a tool that runs locally on your machine and not on some unknown server.  I have seen many instances where unsuspecting system admins would utilize these sites to test their firewall only to be on the receiving end of endless connection attempts from around the world including Russia and China.\nCould they have found eventually? Yes. But running a port scan, especially when it responds on well known ports like 80, 8080, 443, 22, etc, you're confirming there's a server there.\nBottom Line\nThis is actually a networking question and specifically how to configure a firewall and to test those ports.  The end device being an iPhone is really not germane here as this issue would exist with an Android or a PC. Your router manufacturer should have HOWTO guides on firewalls and port forwarding.  From there, take a look at https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/ here on Stack Exchange for more in depth information regarding firewalls and port forwarding.\n", "Q: Apple Automator: where does it store a new filename?

In Numbers, such an option doesn't exist that I know of.\nSecond, how can I import text (including numbers) as text? With windows I can do both of these functions with the Text Import Wizard and with Numbers I can't do either.\nThe only solution I've found to the first problem is to download a custom workflow that I found in this Apple Community thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8293955\nAnd a less elegant solution is also discussed here but it's much more clunky: How can I do text-to-columns in Numbers?\nRegardless, I still haven't found a way to import numbers as text.\n\nA: Not sure which version of Numbers you are using but one can adjust import settings from a text file in both Numbers v6.1 and v10.2 and it works resonably well in my experience.\nJust open the text file using Numbers and a popup menu will emerge saying \"Table data was imported. Adjust Settings\" as soon as the file is opened.

By record, I mean record a video using the option available in the Control Center. If I am running out of the local storage space, can I record (upload?) directly to the Drive?

When I logged in to support.apple.com and search for the nearest service provider, it said it is not possible, as I expected. My location services are turned off since Day 1. There is no particular reason, I just do not need that for the device in question. Only one device is added to the particular account, and I never really carry this device to anywhere.\nI remember to have search up my zip code once (on the support website to get the nearest provider) which probably might be available to them (albeit unlikely), or they probably have the data because of the details provided by Apple Store from where I purchased it.\nIt freaks me out, since I do not see something that they see. Not because they have the details.\n\nA: There could be multiple sources that Apple has received your location from.\nEven if you do not think about it, your IP addresses is actually transmitted to the web server (Apple's server) every time you load up a web site. In many cases an IP address can pinpoint your location to a specific city or similar. This would be enough for them to able to suggest a store in a specific zip code.\nIn addition WiFi-enabled devices without GPS are still able to find their location from other sources - for example the names (SSIDs) of WiFi access point the device \"sees\". When it is moved around, it is possible to assemble a list of known access points which can then be translated into a position by an online server. For example the cars that Google uses to gather data for Google Maps also collects WiFI SSID information for this purpose.\nIf you're especially worried that Apple support knows your location, I would just ask them where they have your address from. If you're located within the European Union, you have rights based on the GDPR that would ensure that they're obligated to tell you that they have this information on file.\n\nA: At the bottom of every page on Apple's site where your location is shown, at least in the UK, is a footnote explaining where Apple gets your location from.\n\n†† […] We found your location using your IP address or because you entered it during a previous visit to Apple.\n\n", "Q: External Sonnet 550 eGPU not providing enough power for MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) I have an external Sonnet box https://www.sonnetstore.com/products/egfx-breakaway-box-550, and it is not charging my notebook fast enough, e.g battery still draining when the MacBook screen is open. Especially with docker and compiling and IPad as an external display. When the screen is closed, all good enough, e.g 3-4 powers of gaming until the battery is 0.\n\nI tried to plug in external power adapter (native) when eGPU is powered, but MAC does not switch to it, despite Apple states, that it will use a source with the most power.\nHowever, if I change the order of load, e.g. plug power first, then Sonnet, then the battery is charging from the native adapter and all good.\nStill, it is sad that need two cables and eGPU is not powering enough\nIs there any way to fix it? Maybe to switch power read from another source? E.g. some command in terminal to use the specific USB-C port for power or whatever?\n\nA: If you have a new box that you're still able to return, you could consider buying the 650 model instead of 550 model that you currently have. The 650 models supports charging the laptop with up to 100 watts, whereas the 550 model only supports 87 watts.\nIn regards to switching power source and your comment regarding that you think Apple incorrectly states that the source with the most power is used:\nThe 2018 version of the 15\" MacBook Pro comes with a 87 watts charger. So it is actually rates to supply the same amount of power as your Sonnet box. Therefore I don't think you can expect the laptop to switch to it when you connect it.\nIt is only the newer models from 2019 and on that comes with a 96 watts charger.\nYou could consider buying the newer 96 watts MacBook Pro charger to ensure more power is supplied to the laptop, but you'll still have to plug in two cables this way.\nThere's no command in Terminal that allows you to choose a different power source for charging.\n", "Q: Make a single line of text bold in Mail message using Automator?

(Sometimes while the battery is full and still plugged, sometimes while charging)\nSTORY OF THE MACBOOK SO FAR:\n\n*\n\n*The \"battery is not charging\" issue start happening early this year, but the Macbook had another issue with the logic board as well.

With the release of Catalina (10.15.5), there is a feature called Battery Health Management that will actually stop the charging of the battery at a certain battery charge range.  This \"battery not charging\" message is perfectly normal when this function/feature is enabled.\nFaulty USB Mux Chip\nThere have been reports that the USB Mux chip (TI CB3215) is faulty.  This chip is what negotiates the charging power to be delivered from the USB-C (USB-PD compliant) power adapter.  It starts off with a 5V nominal voltage, but then can go as high as 20V at about 3A (≅ 61W).  The full spec calls for up to 20V @ 5A or 100W, but (obviously) can be lower due to a lower overall wattage rating.\nThis is expected given that the correct charger for the 2017 MacBook Pro is the 87W charger.  See the Apple Support document Find the right power adapter and cable for your Mac notebook.  If you use a power adapter with less than the required wattage, your MacBook will not be able to supply enough power for all of it's functions - charging and powering the computer.  In this case, it was using all available power to run the laptop and there wasn't any left to charge the battery.\nYour charger is likely good\n\nWhen using the power adapter from Apple and the USB-C cable on another device (unfortunately a phone and not another MacBook), it's charging normally.\n\n\"Normally\" is relative here. If it's from a MacBook and USB-C PD compliant (which Apple chargers are) it would be sufficient enough to charge the phone at what appears to be a \"normal rate.\"  Being that it's USB-C, it would conform to the USB Power Delivery Specification (USB-PD) where the current is negotiated to the highest possible.  As mentioned earlier, it would start off at 5V then negotiate from there.  As most phones use a 5V and a 2-2.5A charger anyway, even without negotiating power, the adapter is delivering the maximum (what the phone will draw) to charge the phone.  This means your charger is likely working as it should.  However, a proper test would be to try that charger on a different MacBook.  If you see that it negotiates anywhere near it's full 61W, then you've confirmed it's viability.\n\nWhen using another power adapter on the MacBook, it's charging slowly (but coming from a 12W power adapter and a USB-A to USB-C cable that seems fair enough).\n\nThis is also expected.  Most USB-A chargers only supply up to 12 watts of power. There is no power negotiation with these chargers.  When connected to your MacBook, it will receive the 5V from the adapter, the Mac will attempt to ask for more but since it will not get a response, it will just continue to draw the 12W available.\nTL;DR\nSome of this, as described is normal behavior if Battery Health Management is enabled.  If you suspect your adapter, you can use aftermarket USB-C chargers with confidence but I always recommend getting quality adapters and cables from well known vendors like Anker, Belkin, StarTech, etc.  However, there is the possibility that the USB mux chip that regulates the charging is failing or has failed.  Apple will require a replacement of the logic board, but there are board repair facilities that can replace that single component.\n\n*\n\n*60w charger only delivering 5.5w to battery?\n\n*Is the Macbook 12 inch's USB-C charger interchangeable with other USB-C chargers or devices?\n\n*Danger of damaging 13\" macbook pro by charging it with 85w charger?\n\nA: After a while I had the chance to try a spare  96W power adapter from  Apple.\nIt looks like the only non fonctional component was the power adapter itself (when trying my usb cable with the 96W power adapter, everything goes as expected).\n", "Q: How do I identify if my EarPods lightning are original? When I connect the EarPods purchased along with iPhone from suspect source I see this:\n\n\nIs this not weird? Are they original or not?\n\nA: The screenshots you have are identical to ones I have seen before with third party (non-original) minijack-to-Lightning adapters.\nThe EarPods that comes with an iPhone matches the iPhone. Therefore if you have an iPhone with just a Lightning connector, then your EarPods should have had a Lightning plug and not require an adapter.\nThis seems to indicate that the EarPods you have did not originally come with that iPhone. Whether they are are original or not is hard to say from the information given - it might be original EarPods with a non-original minijack to Lightning converter.\n\nA: Based on the fact that the word Beats at the top of the 2nd image is misspelled I'd think it would be safe to say that the Earpods are not original.\n", "Q: 82GB of \"other\" don't appear in OmniDiskSweeper or Freediskspace I have a new MacBook Pro 13' where I installed a few programs and transferred my files from my previous MacBook.

Still not sure why it happened in the first place.\n\nA: The number Grand Perspective shows as \"Miscellanous used space\" represents the amount of data that Grand Perspective hasn't scanned.\nThis could be due to you only scanning part of the drive (for example just scanning the home directory for one user, whilst other user's data haven't been scanned), setting a filter or lack of permissions.\nIf you haven't done so already, I would suggest giving Grand Perspective Full Disk Access and try again. You do this from System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy.\nIn case it is not due to files that are not scanned, the space could be taken up by file system snapshots - for example made by TimeMachine backups.\n\nA: My supposition is that these are probably APFS snapshots.\nThe best tool to use to see/delete these is Carbon Copy Cloner. Select the drive in the lower-left corner of the main window (see below where I have selected the drive named \"SSD\")\n\nOnyX can also do this, but my experience was that it would only delete snapshots created my Time Machine.

It will state that there is no library can you create the new one on your smaller volume.\nDon't forget to keep iCloud Photos on and the \"Optimize Mac Storage\" selected.\n", "Q: Pin Application to Specific Screen Is there anyway to pin windows that an application launches to a specific screen? As an example zoom launches two windows when starting a meeting one that for video and one with meeting information. It used to keep launching them in the same screens but lately I have noticed that each window will open on a different screen each time. The pattern seems random as sometimes they will just swap places but other times they will go to a different screen where it is not normally on to begin with.\n\nA: Apps will launch to a given Space, if set - right click the app in the Dock > Options , *.\nThey will only launch to a given physical display if you don't have \"Displays have separate Spaces\" on in System prefs > Mission Control.\nApps do not like being spread across multiple Spaces.\n*Apple use the terms Desktop and Space interchangeably, unfortunately. Display, however, always means 'physical screen'.\n", "Q: Find all \"Other\" Files How do I find any and all delete-able files on my Mac that are classified as other? My brother installed games on my computer, and even after clearing out \"Downloads\" and deleting the game applications I have 30 gb of \"Other\" files that I have no way of deleting because I don't know where they are on my computer.\n\nA: I assume you're looking at the About This Mac Storage tab; dealing with that \"Other\" category is tough (illustrated by the wealth of search results for \"mac storage other\"), as it is comprised of a combination of files in many locations.\nA recommendation would be to click the Manage button (Apple Menu -> About This Mac -> Storage) and start with the \"Reduce Clutter\" option, which may identify unused files that are taking up the most space.\n\nIf that option doesn't provide enough items to clear out, a second recommendation would be to try an app like MacPaw's CleanMyMac X, which can identify the files taking up that space to give you a better idea of what can be safely removed.\nA more manual (but free and open source) option is something like Grand Perspective, which allows you to visualize the areas that are taking up the most space, but leaves the process of removing them (and knowing how to do so safely) up to you.\n", "Q: How to clone startup disk? In the process of upgrading to a new SSD in my iMac 2017 Catalina. After setting everything up using Disk Utility, it is asking if I want to restore from “iMacintosh HD” or “Macintosh HD - Data”  I read here of someone having a similar question but his situation was slightly different. I simply want to clone my existing startup disk so I can swap out the old drive with the new one. Can anyone guide me through this?\nMany thanks in advance.\n-JJ\n\nA: Cloning isn’t easy in my experience since you need to first learn a bit about specifics and how to select a proper clone tool tool and understand any filesystem differences between your exact versions of OS.\nWhy not install a fresh OS on the SSD and then when it first starts migrate everything from the old OS?\nApple tools handle this for you including all the version difference if you choose a different OS on the new disk. And with two disks, you can thoroughly test the new drive before you install it or wipe the internal drive.\n", "Q: Share to Messages from Safari fails - missing library Any idea how to install the missing library?\nProcess:               Messages Share Extension [39076]\nPath:                  /Users/USER/Desktop/Messages.app/Contents/PlugIns/Messages Share Extension.appex/Contents/MacOS/Messages Share Extension\nIdentifier:            Messages Share Extension\nVersion:               1.0 (5500)\nBuild Info:            Messages-743013008000000~82\nCode Type:             X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process:        ???

It is not a specific problem with iPhone.\nPlease refer to this issue:\nhttps://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn.io/issues/21\nNote that a similar workflow recently became possible on some Android phones. However it is implemented via CaBLE, as mentioned in the above linked issue. CaBLE is cloud-assisted Bluetooth Low Energy - which is Google's own technology, and not part of the WebAuthn standard.\n", "Q: How to return a list of all text editors via terminal? Is there a way to return a list of all the installed text editors via the command line?\nI think (I can't test to confirm) this answer inadvertently gives the equivalent for ubuntu:\nsudo update-alternatives --config editor\n\n  Selection    Path                Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* 0            /bin/nano            40        auto mode\n  1            /bin/ed             -100       manual mode\n  2            /bin/nano            40        manual mode\n  3            /usr/bin/vim.basic   30        manual mode\n  4            /usr/bin/vim.tiny    10        manual mode\n\nI gave that a try on mac, but command not found.\n\nA: No, there's no such command or list available in the Terminal.\nThe command you've found for Ubuntu is part of the so called alternatives system that is found mostly in Debian-based Linux distributions. It's not available on all Linux systems, it's not available on BSD based systems and definitely not available on macOS.\nAlso the update-alternatives command does not necessarily list all text editors on the system (you see your own list is pretty small). It is only lists those that are registered with the alternatives system, which is not all of them. Commonly GUI-based editors are not listed here for example.\nInstead of alternatives, macOS has the concept of file associations or \"preferred applications\". As far as I recall, this predates alternatives. Application bundles on macOS contain information about the file types that the application is willing to support. The user can choose which application is by default used to open a specific file type - this means that you can associate for example JPEG files with the photo editing software of your own choice. However, this is for GUI programs - not command line utilities as such.\nAn easy way to list and manipulate file associations via the command line is to use the third party utility SwiftDefaultApps. It can be installed from HomeBrew Casks using this command:\nbrew cask install swiftdefaultappsprefpane\n\nAfter installation you'll have a command available named swda. You can run it like this to get a list of file associations:\nswda getUTIs\n\n", "Q: Folder in iCloud that stores files only in cloud but doesn't sync with Mac I'm new to the ecosystem with my new MacBook Pro and I have a question about iCloud storage. I don't have a large SSD so I hope to use my iCloud for files, that's why I subscribed to some storage too. However now I see that all my files that are in cloud are also on my Mac. Some of them I need but my question is wheter it is possible to create a folder in the iCloud that uploads the files and then remove them from the computer?\n\nA: It is possible to manage this - basically you have two options:\n1) Let macOS handle this automatically\nYou enable this from System Preferences by clicking Apple ID, iCloud and then ensure that Optimise Mac Storage is checked.\nThis ensures that everything is stored in iCloud Drive, and as much as possible is also stored on the Mac. However as available space becomes low, the system might delete files from the Mac so that they're only stored in iCloud.\nIn this case you have no control over which files and folders macOS keeps on the computer and which are only available in iCloud.\n2) Handle it manually yourself\nIn the Finder open iCloud and right-click the folder and select Remove Download. This removes the folder's contents on your Mac, but keeps it in iCloud Drive.\n", "Q: How to send a looped video to video feed? I am having some trouble with my webcam on my Mac running Catalina.\nI want to send a looped video of myself to the webcam feed so I can still seem present in meetings. So, like, when Chrome asks the computer for the webcam, I want to be in control of what goes there.\nAn ideal solution would be something I could run with python, free software would also be okay. What is the best way to do this?\n\nA: Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is a free and open source video suite that is capable of cutting from a live feed to a pre-recorded source video.\nIn additional to OBS, you will need obs-mac-virtualcam to map the output to a virtual camera:\n\nCreates a virtual webcam device from the output of OBS.

For example, via system call tracing or similar?\n\nA: It seem like this is, in fact, hardcoded in mDNSResponder.\n╰─ grep -A5 -B5 \"Register localhost\" ./mDNSResponder-1096.40.7/mDNSMacOSX/mDNSMacOSX.c\n        const domainname *const localHostName     = (const domainname *) \"\\x9\" \"localhost\";\n        const domainname *const broadcastHostName = (const domainname *) \"\\xd\" \"broadcasthost\";\n        const mDNSv4Addr        localHostV4       = { { 127, 0, 0, 1 } };\n        mDNSv6Addr              localHostV6;\n        // Register localhost 127.0.0.1 A record.\n        RegisterLocalOnlyARecord(localHostName, &localHostV4);\n        // Register broadcasthost 255.255.255.255 A record.\n--\n--\n        // Register broadcasthost 255.255.255.255 A record.\n        RegisterLocalOnlyARecord(broadcastHostName, &onesIPv4Addr);\n        // Register localhost ::1 AAAA record.\n        mDNSPlatformMemZero(&localHostV6, sizeof(localHostV6));\n        localHostV6.b[15] = 1;\n        RegisterLocalOnlyAAAARecord(localHostName, &localHostV6);\n    }\n\n", "Q: Migrate old files (with date created) to new mac I am considering buying a new macbook of a different model. Is there a way I could migrate the files ALSO keeping the original \"date created\" intact?\n\nA: When you setup a new Mac, you're asked if you want to copy over documents, apps, settings, etc. from an old Mac. This happens using the program known as Migration Assistant. It is an easy and pretty foolproof way to migrate data from an old computer to a new computer.\nMy experience has been that Migration Assistant keeps your creation time stamps intact. It might be necessary to run this from the initial setup prompt to keep the time stamps intact - as opposed to running it manually later on.\nIf you have problems with the file time stamps, you can always manually copy them over later using a tool like rsync. I'm assuming that you only want to do this for some specific user files that you have, and not macOS system files - as they would be different for a new version of macOS on the new computer.\n", "Q: Dual boot (old model) MacBookPro9,2 running new macOS (APFS) without rEFInd Is it even possible to dual boot macOS without using rEFInd? In my system, I have a EFI, APFS and Ext4 partitions storing ESP, macOS (either Mojave or Sierra) and Debian. I used to be able to dual-boot, but some grub update killed my setup. I can now successfully boot directly into grub2 then Debian. But grub2 does not detect the APFS partition so cannot boot it, neither does pressing Alt while powering on brings up macOS disk/drive. Without being able to boot into macOS, I cannot \"bless\" anything either.\n\nA: If macOS does not appear as an option from the Mac Startup Manager (i.e. holding down the alt key at startup), then you have something wrong with the macOS installation. This problem would be independent the installation of Grub and Debian.\nYou have not specified which version of macOS is installed. With the latest versions of macOS, the bless command can not set a default startup unless SIP is disabled. So, most users execute the bless command from macOS Recovery. You have not indicated if the internal macOS Recovery is bootable on your Mac. If not, then your model Mac can access macOS Recovery over the internet.\nIt would be helpful if you could boot to macOS Recovery and post the output from the command diskutil list. Of course, you should choose a version of macOS Recovery that can support APFS.\nMost versions of Linux can be booted from the Mac Startup Manager by default or by copying certain Grub files to the EFI/BOOT folder in an EFI partition. Here the boot file needs to be renamed to BOOTX64.EFI. The problem with copying files is when Grub is updated, then most likely the copied files will not be updated. This is why many users prefer to install rEFInd to the EFI/BOOT folder instead.\n", "Q: How can I hide notifications for a short period? I use notifications heavily as a sort of todo list during the day (mostly Slack and email messages). But sometimes I want to hide these for a while to focus on the whole screen. If I disable notifications I often forgot for hours and find I missed something important. How can I hide the notifications for just 15 minutes and then have it reactivate?\n\nA: One can use \"Turn on Do Not Disturb\" setting for needed time (From: to:), but this will come and bite you on following days if you forget to untick it.\nI am not heavy notifications user but I simply ⌥ + click on Notifications Center icon to turn on / off notifications. Icon is dimmed when it's off and this visual clue is good enough for me (and I usually start worry when I have nothing to do for hours ;-)). Alternatively one can set own keyboard shortcut in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Mission Control -> Turn Do Not Disturb On/Off\n\nA: There is a Mac app called DND Me which will allow you to turn on DND for a specific amount of time\nThere is a free trial on the website, otherwise the price is currently listed as €4.99.\n(I have used this app in the past and it worked as advertised. I am not otherwise affiliated with it in any way.)\n", "Q: iPad won't let me update apps after update to iOS 14 Since updating iPads to iOS 14 I am not able to update apps. After hitting update I am asked for password which I do fill correctly. After about ten seconds the password dialogue appears again, and again, and again.\nI do remember on both iPads Apple tried to force me into two factor authentication which I absolutely do not want. I have clicked on Later as there was no other option for opting out.\nWhat can I do to be able to update the apps? Of course apart of setting up two factor authentication?\n\nA: As of June 17, 2020 you can not turn off two-factor authentication and you can not use some features without enabling it. It was optional, highly encouraged and opt-in on iOS 12 and iOS 13.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915\n\nCan I turn off two-factor authentication after I’ve turned it on?\nIf you already use two-factor authentication, you can no longer turn it off. Certain features in the latest versions of iOS and macOS require this extra level of security, which is designed to protect your information. If you recently updated your account, you can unenroll within two weeks of enrollment. Just open your enrollment confirmation email and click the link to return to your previous security settings. Keep in mind, this makes your account less secure and means that you can't use features that require higher security.\n\nI have not tested the unenrollment in the two week grace period but have no reason to believe it won’t work as described. The services Apple ties to two-factor (which is easily confused with the previous two-step process)  have been changing outside the iOS major release cycle\nThe only thing that’s changed with iOS 14 is Apple removed the opt-in UI since the services themselves are now forcing the upgrade in security.\nYou still want to closely manage all the security at this page whenever a device gives you a hassle or unexpected challenge. (This much hasn’t changed in many years)\n\n*\n\n*https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage\nOnce you review your current settings above and make the security page happy, you may have to choose between this model requiring a second factor past your password and managing the prompts, trying it and declining the features or just letting the features that mandate this fail and go unused.  It appears you could also keep using older software with two-step or relying on the security questions and just a password for existing AppleID.\n", "Q: Disable confirmation dialog when moving files in iCloud Drive in Windows 10 My question is similar to this one but when using iCloud Drive in Windows (more specifically Windows 10). How can I stop iCloud Drive asking me for confirmation when I move files in the Windows Explorer?\n\nThis is specially annoying because many of the operations are just a rename (Ok, a move operation, but within the same directory), or move within iCloud itself. Also, a lot of times the Windows Explorer remains on top and you don't see the message, getting stuck until you realize why the action is blocked.\n\nA: in windows go to icloud Drive in file Explorer and open the \".Trash\" Folder (you have to enable \"show hidden files\" in explorer) select all files in the folder (if there are no files create some text files inside your icloud drive and delete them after they got uploaded) right click on the selected files and click delete, now there should be a popup window where you can add a check mark. check it and click OK.\nnow if you delete files inside your icloud drive folder it shouldn't ask you for confirmation anymore.\nProblem solved\nif you move multiple folders/files out of icloud drive it will now ask you just once for confirmation instead of for every single file\ntook me a while until I figured that out, hope it works for you too.\n", "Q: MacOS Catalina 10.15.7 is causing a Kernal Panic - Forced an update to T2 chip by installing Big Sur - My machine is now bricked So only in the last 2 weeks has my Macbook Pro 2018 starting having this kernal panic problem. I was on 10.15.7 and after disabling the power nap and vault encryption suggestions I still had no luck preventing the kernel panic. The firmware of the T2 chip was 17P6610 with Darwin Kernel Version 19.6.0.\nI then tried to do a clean install of OSX High Sierra and the issue persisted (The T2 chips firmware was still 17P660 - It didn't roll back). As a last ditch effort I went ahead and installed OSX Big Sur because I though that I might be able to force a firmware update to the chip to a later version but ran into a fatal problem. The install completed just fine but when I restarted my Macbook it turned off and has not turned on since. I can hear the fan spin up quickly and then cut out but nothing happens. It is a complete brick right now. I would not advise anyone to do what I did unless you have a high level of expertise to figure out what might go wrong if you did what I did.\nMy question is: Has anyone been in the same position as I have and successfully recovered their machine? I am reading up on how to use Apple's Configurator 2 in DFU mode to revive the chip but I have never done this before. Any inputs on where I should go from here? I am saving a trip to the Apple store as the absolute last solution but it feels like I am getting closer to have to do that.\n\nA: You should use the Configurator to restore the T2 chip. Follow the steps shown here:\nApple Support: https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-2/revive-or-restore-mac-firmware-apdebea5be51/mac\n", "Q: Will Macbook Air 2017 benefit from Catalina upgrade? I'm running Mojave on my Macbook Air (2017) and was wondering if anyone can recommend (or not) upgrading to Catalina now that 10.15.7 seems to be stable release.\nI'm not using any 32bit apps, so no problems there.\nHowever, is it worth actually upgrading? I know I can't use certain features (such as the battery health or sidecar), but should I do it for security, etc?\nWhat are the experiences of other MBA 2017 owners after upgrade? Has anyone experienced slowdowns? Is anything actually better? Or should I just stick with Good Ol' Mojave?\nThanks.\n\nA: \nHowever, is it worth actually upgrading?\n\nA newer macOS release always includes the latest security patches for any discovered hardware of software vulnerabilities. So generally speaking, it's a good idea to upgrade if your device supports running it, given you have no reason to refrain from upgrading.\n\nI know I can't use certain features (such as the battery health or sidecar), but should I do it for security, etc?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat are the experiences of other MBA 2017 owners after upgrade? Has anyone experienced slowdowns? Is anything actually better? Or should I just stick with Good Ol' Mojave?\n\nThis experience could be pretty subjective depending on the apps being used, but generally speaking, a newer release of macOS also often includes under the hood performance improvements which are also claimed about by Apple.\n\nA: Well - I took the plunge and updated my MBA 2017 to Catalina and so far all seems well. Everything seems to be working OK, and I have (so far) not run in to any issues.\nI did not have any 32 bit apps to worry about and I am pleased to see that my old M-Audio FastTrack guitar interface still works with Catalina, so all's good!\nFingers crossed I have not spoken too soon - I don't fancy the downgrade process (although it is allegedly no too difficult since I have a Time Machine backup from right before the upgrade).\n", "Q: Slow Transfer Between External Drives I have two external USB drives connected to my 2012 Mac mini, and am finding transfer speeds between the two to be really slow. I need to transfer 38GB of stuff. With rsync, I was getting ~60MBps. Canceled that and moved to Finder and am getting an estimate of ~9 hours to complete the operation.\nI did restart the Mac mini hoping it would improve things, but no change. Thoughts on how to improve this?\n\nA: A method I use to move large numbers of files is the Terminal mv or cp commands. The first command actually moves directories/files from one location to the other, the other just copies the directories/files. This is much quicker than Finder, which adds a tremendous amount of overhead to the process.\nSecondly I strongly suggest you go to System Preferences > Spotlight, and add both external drives into the Privacy pane. This stops Spotlight from indexing the files. The drives can be removed from the pane when you're done if you want these drives indexed.\n\n", "Q: tput: unknown terminal \"term-256color\" When I open a new terminal I keep having following warning message:\ntput: unknown terminal \"term-256color\"\ntput: unknown terminal \"term-256color\"\ntput: unknown terminal \"term-256color\"\ntput: unknown terminal \"term-256color\"\n$\n\nHow can I fix this? What may be the main cause of it?\n\nA: Unix uses the TERM environment variable to look up various escape sequences in the termcap database to allow programs to do more than just output characters to the terminal (which in these days typically are emulated in CMD.EXE, Putty or similar).  Examples are \"clear the screen\", \"move cursor to a specific spot on the screen\".\nYour terminal emulator is configured to tell Unix that it emulates \"term-256color\" but Unix does not have that terminal in its termcap database.\nReconfigure your terminal emulator to tell that it is one that it knows.  Typical examples are \"vt100\" and \"xterm\".  Which one exactly may require some experimentation after close reading of the documentation.\n", "Q: Local Items keychain recovery after system wipe I recently wiped my Mac and now i need help restoring my old keychain. My website passwords used to be stored in keychain's \"Local Items\" (no iCloud sync) and I had made a copy of /Library/Keychains folder prior to wiping the Mac. As far as I understand those passwords are saved in /Library/Keychains/UUID/keystore-2.db which should not be accessible on any other system when transferred as it is linked to the original system by the UUID. The \"Login\" keychain is working fine, it transfers and unlocks without problems.\nFound a lot of info online about this topic, but most problems were regarding transferring \"Local Items\" keychain to a new machine (which is not possible without first exporting to another keychain). My question is whether it is possible to somehow access the old \"Local Items\" keychain while I still have access to the same machine despite it being wiped and freshly installed? I have the old keychain files and know the unlock passcode.\n\nA: Seems like the \"LocalItems\" password database is encrypted with a machine specific key and cannot be opened with any other system. The good news is this key does not change after a complete system wipe (must be some kind of a hardware key). So even if the system is completely wiped, rename the fresh \"Keychains\" library folder to something like \"Keychains_old\" and copy your old \"Keychains\" folder, reboot and voila, everything accessible once again. Might need to input your old keychain unlock code when opening if your current user login code differs from the pre-wipe one.\n", "Q: What's the 2020/Catalina method of getting my Mac to boot with Windows Bootcamp next time only? It seems that pre-2015, the world and his mother wanted to get Bootcamp to boot to Windows just once, and keep the default startup disk as Mac. There are loads of threads that say to use Bless or Bootchamp:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/36266/boot-camp-is-it-possible-to-restart-directly-to-windows-from-mac-os-x/167577#167577,\nhow to quickly reboot from OSX to Windows and back.\nBut, these methods no longer work, it would seem.\nI found this Reddit post which says to use sudo systemsetup -setstartupdisk /Volumes/.BOOTCAMP/WINDOWS && reboot, but I don't think this sets it to boot next time only; and all the advice I've read says not to test out sudo commands without fully understanding them, which I certainly do not.\nSo could anyone tell me, or point me towards some information that would get this to work for Catalina. I'm either looking for a modern version of Bootchamp (though, I'm sure Googling it would have got me to it if something like that existed), or a new way to run sudo bless -mount \"/Volumes/BOOTCAMP\" -legacy -setBoot -nextonly;sudo shutdown -r now.\nI know I'm lazy and holding down the option key when I need to boot to Windows really isn't all that problematic, but I think I may have a faulty option key, as sometimes it boots to mac a few times before finally working. It would be so much easier if it could be done with something like the command above.\n\nA: One primary purpose of the \"nextonly\" option is to allow for installation of a startup manager. For example, if you install rEFInd as a boot manager, then you would configure the Mac to always boot to rEFInd. This boot manager can be configured to display different operating system to boot. After a selection is made, rEFInd instructs the firmware to boot this operating system once. After the selected operating shuts down or restarts, the firmware will boot back to rEFInd.\nOne possible solution to your problem would be to install rEFInd and configure to allows boot to macOS after a small delay. You could then during this delay choose to boot instead to Windows.\nrEFInd has implemented a new feature that allows you press a number at startup. This number is stored in the keyboard buffer. When rEFInd starts up, the number is read from this buffer. If the number matches a menu item, then the operating system matching the item will boot. This feature was implemented to avoid having to make a select during the small delay mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n", "Q: Internet over Wi-Fi working but not over Ethernet (LAN) I have run into a curious problem. When I connect my MacBook via LAN cable, the Internet doesn't work, but I can still ping other devices in my network (including the router) and also can access my network hard disk.\nWhen I connect via Wi-Fi to the same router, the Internet works, so does anything else as it's supposed to.\nI prefer using the LAN cable as it's faster and more reliable, so I really would like to solve this issue.\nPlease, note that I cannot restart my computer, because I'm running a very important operation, which cannot be interrupted and will take several weeks.\nI hope someone will point me to the right direction as to investigating this issue.\nMacBook:\n\n*\n\n*macOS Catalina Version 10.15.7\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)\n\n*Processor 2,6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7\n\n*Memory 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4\n\n*Startup Disk Macintosh HD\n\n*Graphics Radeon Pro 560X 4 GB\n               Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB\n\nRouter: AirPort Time Capsule 802.11ac\nUPDATE # 2 as per Allan's question:\nYes, I turn off Wi-Fi when I try to connect via Ethernet and yes, I can ping 8.8.8.8 and I also can ping other websites if I use their IP address but I cannot connect to a university VPN.\nUPDATE # 2 as per Allan's question:\noutput of ipconfig getpacket en0 | grep \"domain_name_server\" with Wi-Fi turned off => nothing. en0 is my Wi-Fi interface by the way and en8 is my Ethernet, so just in case I issued the command also with en8 instead of en0:\noutput of ipconfig getpacket en8 | grep \"domain_name_server\" with Wi-Fi turned off => domain_name_server (ip_mult): {192.168.1.1}\nOutput of both commands with Wi-Fi on is the same => domain_name_server (ip_mult): {192.168.1.1}\nUPDATE # 3 as per Allan's suggestion:\noutput of nslookup apple.com 192.168.1.1:\n;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\nUPDATE # 4 as per Allan's comments:\nI am able to successfully ping my router with ping 192.168.1.1\nI am still unable to ping www.apple.com or www.google.com nor am I able to access the Internet after setting the DNS manually with networksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet 8.8.8.8, wherein I replaced Ethernet with my the name of my LAN netowork service (found out using networksetup -listallnetworkservices).\nWith networksetup -getdnsservers Ethernet I get 8.8.8.8\nUPDATE # 5 as per jksoegaard's suggestion:\nI tried manually configuring my IPv4 settings under my Ethernet connection in Network preferences, without success:\n\nI also tried changing the default gateway through Terminal:\n% sudo route add default 192.168.1.1\nroute: writing to routing socket: File exists\nadd net default: gateway 192.168.1.1: File exists\n% \n\nThe internet is still not working properly (cannot browse), though.\nJust for note, I am able to successfully ping Google, but not by its web address, but rather using its IP address:\nI had to use nslookup with my Wi-Fi on because otherwise (with only my Ethernet on) it wouldn't work. en0 is my Wi-Fi interface.\n% nslookup www.google.com\nServer:     8.8.8.8\nAddress:    8.8.8.8#53\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   www.google.com\nAddress: 172.217.19.100\n\n% sudo ifconfig en0 down % \nping 172.217.19.10 \nPING 172.217.19.10 (172.217.19.10): 56 data bytes \n64 bytes from 172.217.19.10: icmp_seq=0 ttl=113 time=127.881 ms\n64 bytes from 172.217.19.10: icmp_seq=l ttl=113 time=129.241 ms\n64 bytes from 172.217.19.10: icmp_seq=2 ttl=113 time=128.347 ms\n64 bytes from 172.217.19.10: icmp_seq=3 ttl=113 time=128.451 ms\n^C\n— 172.217.19.10 ping statistics —\n4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0.0% packet loss \nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 127.881/128.480/129.241/0.489 ms\n%\n\nUPDATE # 6 as per jksoegaard's update:\nnetworksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet 1.1.1.1\n\ndidn't help.\nHere's the output of the other 2 commands:\n% dig @1.1.1.1 www.google.com\n\n; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @1.1.1.1 www.google.com\n; (1 server found)\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\n% nslookup www.google.com\n\n;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\n\n% \n\nUPDATE # 7:\nEventually, I was forced to restart the computer, which solved the problem. I have no idea what it might have been nor how to replicate the issue. I really would like to know what it caused.\n\nA: According to your question you can access local network devices when on cabled LAN. You have set your DNS server to 8.8.8.8, but still cannot lookup names.\nYou're able to ping your router at 192.168.1.1 and other local devices, but not internet servers such as apple.com or google.com.\nThis suggests to me that your problem is that the default gateway is set incorrectly. Fix it this way:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Network\n\n\n*Choose the Ethernet port in the list on the left\n\n\n*Ensure the Router field is set to: 192.168.1.1\nIf it is setup to use DHCP, take a note of your IP address, subnet mask and router addresses, and then change the setting \"Configure IPv4\" to \"Manually\" and enter the same values - however note that router should be set to 192.168.1.1.\nAfter applying, you should be able to access web sites and ping servers on the Internet.\nYou can also try changing this from the Terminal by running:\nroute add default 192.168.1.1\n\nUPDATE:\nYour new update indicates now that you can ping outside IPs successfully, but not when using domain names. This means this is a DNS issue, and not a routing issue.\nChange the DNS server IP like this in the Terminal:\nnetworksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet 1.1.1.1\nThen check if web sites start working. If not, run these two commands in the Terminal:\ndig @1.1.1.1 www.google.com\nnslookup www.google.com\n\nThe output should tell if it is at all possible to lookup DNS via 1.1.1.1 (if not, you probably have some sort of firewall or filtering issue) - or it is due to the specified DNS server not actually being used at all.\n", "Q: How to delete all but certain values from many JSON files? I've used youtube-dl to download all my videos from Youtube. With these, are created a JSON file for each video file. inside these JSON files is a LOT of junk. but there are 3 items/values/categories(?) that i want to keep, the rest can be deleted.\nThose things are\n{\"upload_date\": \"value\",\n\"fulltitle\": \"value\",\n\"description\": \"value\"}\n\nSo I either need to:\n\n*\n\n*delete all but these 3 items & save the file, or\n\n*extract these 3 items to a new file & delete the old one.\n\nHow can I do this with Automator or with shell tools in Terminal?\n\nA: Here is one of the ways I would do it...\nThe following was tested and worked for me under macOS Catalina 10.15.6.\nI downloaded jq from https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/ under the OS X section:\n\n\n*\n\n*jq 1.6 binary for 64-bit\n\nIn Terminal, I ran the following commands:\ncd ~/Downloads\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine jq-osx-amd64\nsudo cp jq-osx-amd64 /usr/local/bin/jq\nsudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/jq\n\n    • Note: If /usr/local/bin does not already exist, it must first be created with e.g.: sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin\nThe aforementioned steps have now set up jq for use from the command line in Terminal, or from a Run Shell Script action in Automator, or a do shell script command using AppleScript.\nDownloading a video from YouTube with youtube-dl using the --write-info-json option, I then used the example shell script code, shown below, in a Run Shell Script action in an Automator workflow as a Service/Quick Action to process the JSON file so it would only have the keys you've mentioned.\nExample shell script code:\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    [[ -f $f ]] || continue\n    [[ $f =~ .*\\.json$ ]] || continue\n    fn=\"${f##*/}\"\n    tmpfile=\"$(mktemp /tmp/\"${fn}.XXXXXX\")\" || exit 1\n    /usr/local/bin/jq '{\"upload_date\": .upload_date, \"fulltitle\": .fulltitle, \"description\": .description}' \"$f\" > \"$tmpfile\"\n    mv \"$tmpfile\" \"$f\"\ndone\n\nWith this setup as shown in the image further below, I select the JSON file, created by youtube-dl using the --write-info-json option, in Finder and then right-click on it selecting Cleanup youtube-dl JSON from the context menu.\nIt then produced a JSON file with the following example structure, while overwriting the original JSON file:\n{\n  \"upload_date\": \"20080913\",\n  \"fulltitle\": \"Jerry Seinfeld returns to Comedy on the Letterman show\",\n  \"description\": \"Jerry Seinfeld returns to Comedy on the Letterman show\"\n}\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*The example JSON file was created from the output of:\nyoutube-dl --write-info-json https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JOsxxm-RnQ\n\n\n\n*The example shell script code, as coded, can handle multiple selected JSON files in Finder at the same time.\n\n\n*While the example shell script code does contain some error handling, nonetheless it does not backup the original JSON file(s) before overwriting. Additional code is required to be added if that is something you need/want.\n\n\n*The example shell script code, as coded, does not contain any error handling in regards to the jq command used and is only meant to be used on JSON files created by youtube-dl using the --write-info-json option with the assumption that the target keys always exist under the circumstances. Otherwise, additional error handling may be required.\n\n\n*The format of the  JSON files created by youtube-dl using the --write-info-json option are flat formatted, meaning it is written all on one line. The output of the jq command, as written, produces multi-line output. If you desire flat formatted output, you can use the -c option, e.g.,: jq -c ...\n\n\n*The example shell script code can be used in a standard  shell script, made executable, and run from the command line in Terminal.\n\n\n*The error handling can be removed from the example shell script code and formatted so it can also be use as a one-liner after changing directory the where the JSON files are located. e.g.:\nfor f in *.json; do jq '{\"upload_date\": .upload_date, \"fulltitle\": .fulltitle, \"description\": .description }' \"$f\" > \"tmp\"; mv tmp \"$f\"; done\n\n        • Note: This overwrites the original file without a backup.\n\n*\n\n*NOTE: JSON files are not just ordinary plain text files per se, they are specially formatted, and one should not parse them with utilities such as sed, awk, etc., and instead use a utility expressly designed to work with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files! jq is a utility designed to work with JSON files.\n\n", "Q: How to swap Ctrl and Function key?

It is very distracting when trying to paste text or a screenshot into OneNote for example.\niPad 12.9 2018\nIOS 13.7\n\nA: Disabling the text insertion gesture may be impossible unless you consider adding an external keyboard or setting up voiceover to intercept and remap that gesture. I have had good success with peers using physical keyboards or accessories and propping up their iPad. Or use an Apple Pencil for many gestures and scribbles, which lessens the time fingers are on screen.\nHopefully over time you can train yourself and just summon the keyboard when you want it, knowing the gesture that summons it is a tap and hold.\nHere are the global touch delays, if you want to experiment with them.\n\nI find these are invaluable for teaching people to experience the sub second delays needed for a gesture to be recognized, but in the end, the penalty of slowing down the keyboard also slows down other interactions and most people don’t use these unless they need it due to dexterity conditions that make the default timing problematic and over sensitive / too reactive.\n", "Q: Check application version in Catalina I just upgraded to Catalina 10.15.7 coming from High Sierra.\nOn any previous MacOS release I can press space on any app on app drawer to show application version.\nI'm positive they removed it in recent release since I can't view app version anymore.\nAny other method to view app version?\n\nA: You can usually see the version number of an Application in the Finder's Preview pane (most obviously seen in Column View, but also available in other views with View > Show Preview).\n\nSystem Information's Applications panel will also show the Version numbers.

Note that Point #1 still stands, even with Point #2\n\n\n*In addition to Time Machine, also use at least one (preferably two) of:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Backblaze\n\n*Carbon Copy Cloner\n\n*SuperDuper\n\n*Arq\n\n¹ This is usually where someone will chime in and state that they have used Time Machine since it was first released and never had a problem with it. I do not doubt that there are some people who have had that experience, but I tend to consider them sort of like people who win the lottery: I am happy for them, but I would never expect to be one of them, and have decided to assume I never will be. YMMV.\n\nA: This happens for a simple reason. Network errors get flagged as hard drive errors, making NAS destinations too fragile for use. Don’t waste your time on any NAS that says they support Time Machine unless you can get them to actually support you when you get errors like this. When you call them, they will point their finger at Apple and Apple doesn’t support Time Machine to anything but a physical drive now.\nApple built in a failure detection mechanism and when you have too many minor errors, any drive is flagged as unreliable for adding new backup intervals and you are forced to make a decision.\n\n*\n\n*Keep the drive in read-only mode. The data there is fine for a restore, but no new backups can happen. Put it on the shelf in case you have to restore data from when it has data, but put a new drive in the rotation to do new backups.\n\n*Erase the drive to start a clean slate. You lose the history, but you can then see if the drive passes the tests and can store new data safely and reliably.\n\nIf you must back up to NAS for reasons, also back up to an attached drive occasionally so when the NAS fails you, you can erase it and start fresh.\n\nA: I've run into this issue a few times now. Today once again. I'm fed up with it and I'm trying out a fallback system:\nI often notice the failure within a few days. So now I've decided to setup a backup schedule of my timemachine folder in Synology with HyperBackup. The retention policy is set to 60 days.\nNext time Timemachine shows me the finger, I will just get in DSM and restore my timemachine data to the day of the last successful backup. It should theoretically continue again.\nThis time I'm late, so got to reset the timemachine state.\nFingers crossed.\n", "Q: T2 chip encryption benefits: \"Your encrypted SSDs automatically mount and decrypt when connected to you mac.\" I just read the mac page about SSD encryption by the T2 chip here\n\nAlways back up your content to a secure external drive or other secure backup location so that you can restore it, if necessary. You should also turn on FileVault for additional security, because without FileVault enabled, your encrypted SSDs automatically mount and decrypt when connected to your Mac.\n\nI am confused. Isn't encryption only useful when it does not automatically decrypt? This seems rather useless. I guess it prevents certain kinds of attacks: someone steals the SSD from the device using advanced techniques without stealing the whole laptop. In this case, doesn't it just make sense to take the whole laptop?\nWhat is the purpose of the encryption provided by the T2 chip? I know the benefits of FileVault 2 though, which also makes use of the T2 chip. However, to decrypt this FileVault you need your user password. To decrypt the initial T2 encryption, you need nothing?\n\nA: If you examine it at a glance it definitely looks useless - but if you look closer at the details, there are actually benefits to be had here:\nFirst the case of the SSD being separated from the laptop is not as far fetched as you seem to indicate. I wouldn't be thinking of a scenario of a foreign intelligence breaking in and removing the SSD from your laptop without a trace of anything happening. Rather think of some day in the future where you hand in your laptop for repairs to have a bigger disk installed, or to have it replaced due to bad blocks [1].\nYou get your laptop back with a shiny new disk, but you have some certainty that the old disk isn't readable anymore as you've still got your T2 with the key. Similarly if you scrap your laptop, you can scrap the disk and the T2 separately and be reasonable sure that the disk cannot be read [2].\nHowever, the main practical benefits comes by providing quicker responses to the average user. When you buy a new laptop and want to encrypt your drive, that can be done in the blink of the eye with this system, as the drive is already encrypted - you just need to protect the key with the user passphrase. This I assume would make more users encrypt their drives, as some could be put off by having to wait hours or days for the drive to encrypt (even though they can keep using the computer while it does so).\nSimilarly you can safely erase the drive in the blink of an eye. Just ask the T2 to erase the key, and you (and others) no longer have access to the contents on the drive. If the drive hadn't been encrypted in the first place - it is actually very difficult, if not almost impossible, to securely erase it. This can now be done even when the user has never activated FileVault.\n\n[1]As far as I know it is not possible to upgrade your disk currently, but it might be made possibly by third-parties in the future. \n[2]I.e. breaking the main-board PCB into two pieces. It is relatively easy as the SSD and the T2 are separated by a narrow piece of PCB.\n", "Q: macOS compiled binary runs in build folder, but reports killed: 9 when moved to /usr/local/bin I build a series of tools on macOS 10.15.6 using clang from Xcode 12.1.

The question you have linked to does not. An indicator of hybrid partitioning is the output of the following warning message from the gpt command.\nSuspicious MBR at sector 0\n\nWhen a GUID partitioning is being used, there are two tables. The first is the MBR (Master Boot Record) partition table located at sector 0. This is followed by the GPT (GUID Partition Table) which occupies several sectors. When hybrid partition is being used, one or more entries in the GPT are duplicated in the MBR partition table. The gpt remove command can only remove a duplicate entry from the GPT. This means the other duplicate in the MBR partition table remains. The gpt add command will not add an entry to the GPT, if this entry overlaps an entry in the GPT or the MBR partition table. In your case, the duplicate entry in the MBR partition table was indicated by the following line output from the gpt -r show disk0 command.\n     409640 1318255112      2  MBR part 218\n\nHybrid partitioning is required, if you need to BIOS boot an operating system on an older Macs that has a BIOS. For example, older Macs may need to BIOS boot certain versions of Windows. Below are answers which depend on whether Windows is installed.\n\nNote: Since you will be booting to macOS Recovery from a flash drive, you probably can omit sudo from the commands given below. With older versions of macOS and OS X, the -f option for the gpt command may not be available. If the -f option is omitted, then you may need to enter the command diskutil unmountdisk disk0 before entering the gpt command.\n\nAnswer When Windows Is Not Installed\nSince you only have macOS installed, you do not need hybrid partitioning. Below are the steps you can take to remove hybrid partitioning from disk0.\nEnter the following command to edit the MBR partition table.\nsudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0\n\nWhen using the above command, the following warning messages can be ignored.\nfdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\nDevice could not be accessed exclusively.\nA reboot will be needed for changes to take effect.\n\nThis is an interactive command.

Here's what I understand and my questions.\n\n*\n\n*It supports wireless charging at 7.5 Watt.\n\n*It supports\nwireless charging at 15 Watt with a \"MagSafe\" charger. Question: So\nI need to connect the iPhone to the \"MagSafe\" charger and that has a\ncable plugged into the wall? Since I wouldn't call that \"wireless\"\ndo I understand this completely wrong?\n\n*It supports USB-C\ncharging with up to 20 Watt. Which means I need a USB-C charging\nport and the supplied USB-C to Lightning cable.\n\n*It supports\nUSB-A charging. Which means I need any old USB-A port and any USB-A\nto Lightning cable, which most people already have. Question: Is\nthat correct? And how many watts can be supplied that way,\nespecially if I use a higher powered Apple charger, or an Anker\ncharger with \"IQ ports\"?\n\n\nA: Let's clear some things up:\n\n*\n\n*Wireless Charging refers to the Qi wireless charging standard that allows you to charge your phone without directly plugging it in. You place it on a charging pad, or in the case of the new iPhone 12, the MagSafe charger will magnetically align it for you.  You have to plug the base (transmitter) into the wall - it can't obtain power from thin air.\n\n\n*USB-C charging conforms to the USB-C Power Delivery spec in which it negotiates higher charging rates.  To get those higher rates, you need a USB-C charger rated to at least 20W.  You can use a higher one with no problem.  If you use a lower rated one (i.e. the 5W charger) but, you won't get the faster charging speeds; it may not even charge at all.\n\n\n*The \"regular\" USB type A charger (that everyone has) can typically supply up to 12 watts of power.  You can use a charger that supplies more, but the phone will not draw any more than 12 watts.  Again, I recommend, using chargers with higher wattage ratings.\n\n\n*Anker PowerIQ is Anker's technology that identifies what it's connected to so that it can deliver the maximum charge to the device connected.  The first generation of PowerIQ delivered up to 12W and PowerIQ 2.0 can deliver up to 18W.   These really have nothing to do with Apple's products per se other than they are compatible.\nTL;DR\nThe charger (the thing that plugs into the wall) is required; period.  Regardless if it's USB-A or USB-C, you can always use a \"larger\" charger than what is called for, in fact, I recommend it.   A USB-A charger will typically max out at 12W (5V @ 2.4A).  A USB-C charger will go up to 20W.\nIf you go wireless, you still need a charger (USB-C) and the maximum you'll get is 15W using MagSafe and only half that (7.5W) using a regular Qi charger.  No matter what, you still need to plug the Qi base into the wall and the sizing rules still apply - get an adapter \"larger\" than what you need (i.e. get at least 20W).  You can use a USB-C MacBook charger rated at 91W with no problems whatsoever.  The 5W charger that came in the iPhone SE box will not cut it.\nYou can use either the new USB-C charger with Power Delivery or your can use the older USB (type A) chargers that supply 5V at 2.4 Amps\n", "Q: Two 4TB hard drives -- how can I create a RAID 1 with two 2TB partitions? I have been struggling with trying to get Disk Utility to allow me to divide a 4TB HD into two 2TB partitions, and then have a mirrored raid of that for redundancy.  Is this not possible?\n\nA: It is not possible and even if it were it would be a very bad idea.\nRAID 1 is to protect from hardware failure, and as described in the Apple document Create a disk set using Disk Utility on Mac mentioned by @user3439894 in comments, requires multiple disks (not partitions).\n\n\n*\n\n*Mirrored (RAID 1) set: Protect your data against hardware failure with a mirrored RAID set. When you create a mirrored RAID set, your data is written to multiple disks so the information is stored redundantly.\n\n\nEven if it were possible it would provide no protection against hardware failure (as both partitions are on the same disk) and in the case of a HDD would drastically reduce write performance as the disk arm would have to continuously jump back and forward between partitions.\nWhile it may theoretically give some limited protection against bad blocks if you only have one disk you would be much better off making a a backup to another partition (which would protect you from accidental file deletion).  Backup to another to another disk would protect you from disk failure and file loss while RAID 1 is only designed to protect from hardware failure.\n\nA: Disk Utility's RAID support is patchy at best.\nI recommend using SoftRaid. The 'Lite' version is sufficient for basic needs, and costs $50.\nhttps://www.softraid.com\nI use it on my G-RAID unit. I've replaced the drives once, and SoftRaid handled the re-population of each new drive in turn effortlessly.\n", "Q: How to delete a file from Time Machine backups in Big Sur? I'd like to delete a file from my Time Machine backups, but there seems to be no option to do so in the Big Sur version of Time Machine.\nI go to the Time Machine menu and select \"Enter Time Machine\". Then I see the view with the stack of windows. I browse to a file and select it. Now I want to delete it so it doesn't exist and take up space in backups. There is no option to delete it - either the action menu in the toolbar, or the control-click context menu.\nHow do I delete a file from Time Machine backups? There used to be a way to do this.\n(I'd take a screenshot, but the key shortcuts for screenshots don't work in Time Machine. Not sure if this is just a Big Sur thing or if that's always the case.)\nUpdate:\nI should mention I'm using APFS for my Time Machine volume. That seems to be relevant. Also, I contacted Apple support about deleting entire snapshots (slightly different goal than the one here in this question). They said you can't do it anymore. It seems like there's some bugs here, because I have a \"Move to Trash\" option if I control-click one of my backups. It seems to work initially but then the backup comes back.\n\nI don't like losing this much control over my files. I may look for another backup solution.\n\nA: You can't delete individual files or folders from Big Sur's Time Machine.  And using the command line tmutil does not help.\nBig Sur uses the new Time Machine to APFS (TMA). TMA is very different to the old TMH (TM to HFS+).\nTMH used hard linked folders to avoid storing the same folder and its files many times. These hard links were the main cause of corruption or inconsistencies with TMH backup.\nTMA uses an APFS snapshot for each backup. This is proving far more reliable.  But the downside is that you can no longer delete individual files or folders.  You can delete whole snapshots.\nFor a more in-depth discussion of TMA, have a read of the many blogs posts from Howard Oakley, starting with Time Machine: 1 How it works, or fails to.\nI have many large folders for which I want a backup, but don't need lots of history.  TM has never been a good fit for this and TMA's lack of folder delete makes it worse.  I exclude them from my TM backup, and use Chronosync to backup just the current version of the folders.\n\nA: The history deletion and erasure tools are removed from Time Machine graphical interface on Big Sur.\nIf I had an HFS+ formatted drive and I needed to try and excise data surgically, I would find a Mac with an OS from before the deletion tools were removed. For APFS destinations, I’m not aware of any easy workaround.\nAt work, we typically take a drive out of rotation if it has problematic files and archive it under physical security until we erase it. Adding a new clean destination then erasing the old drive is how we are recycling or reclaiming drives now.\n\nA: I was also trying to search for the gear icon and couldn't find one. Instead click on the Top level of your HD and right click then select \"Delete Backup\". Hopefully this deletes everything for that date.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro - External monitors and harddrive I have a Macbook Pro which only has 2 x Thunderbolt 3 ports. I want to allow the following\n\n*\n\n*2 x external monitors, so the ability to have 3 different screens (includes the mac screen)\n\n\n*Power a Lacie Thunderbolt 3 external hard drive.\n\n\n*Charge the mac\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Yes, you can use a Thunderbolt 3 dock such as the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock or similar available from many different makers of docks.\nThat dock allows you to connect the two monitors and charge the Mac via one cable going from the Mac to the dock. The second port on the Mac is then used to power the external Thunderbolt 3 hard drive.\nAlternatively you could connect one monitor and the Thunderbolt 3 hard drive to the dock, and connect those with one cable from the dock to the Mac. The second port on the Mac is then used to output a display signal to the second monitor.\nAnother option, if you haven't already got your monitors, is to buy Thunderbolt 3 monitors with daisy-chaining. These will allow you to connect both monitors and the external drive to a single Thunderbolt 3 chain that will use up only a single port on your Mac.\nNote: Not all monitors support daisy-chaining. Also note that if you have a DisplayPort monitor that support daisy-chaining - it can be part of the chain, but it must be the last device in the chain.\n", "Q: How to obtain previous (not the current) passwords from keychain on iOS?

It's today so happened that the alert of deduction and Apple ID verification came simultaneously and that directed me towards imessage and FaceTime. With a few google searches I found this Apple Support link very helpful, in that forum it written clearly\n\nDepending on your carrier, it can be normal for the activation of iMessage and FaceTime to involve incurring a cost for sending an international SMS message.\n\nAnd when I searched for the cost of international SMS in my country and carrier, it was same as the deduction amount that I got alerted for. Here is a screen shot of a SMS that I get\n\nAnd soon after this I get a deducted alert from my carrier. To ensure that my FaceTime and iMessage are toggled on and activated let me attach images of them:\n\n\nSo, now it's clear that my Iphone 7 is sending international SMSs for the activation of imessage and FaceTime (which I say is already activated). Now, I have two questions:\n\n*\n\n*Why it is sending those international SMS even after activation is done?\n\n*How to stop it? It has already cost a good deal of deduction.\n\n\nA: The most logical answer to this is that it is not sending international SMS messages after activation is done, so it must be something else your carrier is charging you for.\nI would contact your carrier to get an explanation of the costs.\nAs far as I understand, many carriers have business relationsships with Apple and ensure that you are not charged for FaceTime/iMessage activation. You can check a list of carriers here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204039\nUPDATE\nYou have updated the question with the requested information.\nThe phone number you quote is indeed an Apple registration number in the UK. Your own phone number seem to be in India. The carriers I know in Europe usually do not charge their customers for Apple registrations, but your Indian carrier apparently does.\nThe text message you have is not the FaceTime registration message - it doesn't look like that. It does however look like a standard receipt that indicates that a has been delivered succesfully.\nI would try disabling and enabling FaceTime/Messages (i.e. specifically your phone number from FaceTime/Messages) to try to trigger a re-registration.\nIf that doesn't work, contact Apple to work out why it keeps trying to register.\n\nA: Apple charges nothing so your title is quite misleading. If you have excessive SMS to register or your activation is messed up, I can see how you might have to pay for text messages if you don’t have unlimited SMS or are over your quota.\n\n*\n\n*Can your carrier temporarily block SMS or offer unlimited while you work out registration issues?\n\n*Can you de-register your SMS and use messages without an expensive cellular number attached? - https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/\n\n*Are you using the phone in a geography / country that’s not the same as your SMS account?\n\nUsing this guide, you hopefully can select a carrier that is easier on your wallet if needed.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204042\n", "Q: Keynote Mac, delete cropped image to reduce file size without losing image resolution quality I have lots of high-resolution images inserted into the Keynote which makes the file very large. Image masking in Keynote is very convenient for me. But I only want a small corner of the images shown in the slides, and I don't need the cropped part anymore. Reducing file size under the File menu loses image quality and the cropped images are still there. Is there any way to delete the cropped part to reduce file size without losing image resolution/quality?\n\nA: Probably the easiest sequence of steps:\n\n*\n\n*Copy masked image in Keynote\n\n*Cmd+N in Preview\n\n*Cmd+C\n\n*Paste in Keynote\n\nYou will have to process the images as crops before adding them to the slide deck since Keynote takes advantage of the entire image for moves, crops, masks and more.\n", "Q: Why does Citrix CAG (RDP across monitors) take up multiple Spaces? I used to have just my iMac and I used Spaces to have different apps on different desktops (i.e. Mail on desktop1, iTunes on desktop2, Chrome on desktop3).\nI've recently attached another monitor to my iMac and I use Citrix CAG to remote to a Windows PC for work. I share my remote desktop connection across both monitors. To do this, I had to disable the 'Displays have separate Spaces' setting under Mission Control.\nNow when I switch between Spaces, the remote desktop connection stays on display on each Space.\nIs there any way to avoid this but to keep the Space functionality and to be able to have the remote desktop connection across both monitors?\n\nA: It sounds like you have it set to All Spaces [Desktops].\nWith the app running & in the correct Space, right click it in the dock & select Options > This Desktop.\n\nFor a fuller answer on setting up & using Spaces, see my other related answers at  https://superuser.com/a/1187552/347380 or https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/179403/85275\n", "Q: Focus navigation with arrows keys There is a handy option in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts named \"Use keyboard navigation to move mouse focus between controls\".\nIt basicly allows to change focused control with Tab/Shift+TAB. In windows there is option to do this with arrows. Can I somehow make such behaviour on macOs?\n\n\nA: Tab is used for moving between controls and arrow keys are used to move within the control group.\nFor example if your focus is on tabs control in 'Keyboard' window ('Keyboard', 'Text'... 'Dictation') then you can move between them with left/right arrows. Or if if you are on 'Shortcuts' tab you use tab to move into left pane, move there with up-down arrows, reach desired selection ('Accessibility' on your screenshot), use tab to move to the right pane and use up-down arrows to move there (and use space to tick / untick options).\n", "Q: Hub disconnect from MacBook Pro 2018 Touch Bar I have a problem with my MBP 2018 Touch Bar.\nToday I unplugged two hubs (with ethernet cable, HDMI, SD card reader and 4 USB ports)... and after this, when I plugged again the device the computer doesn't detect it, and I lost my other screen, keyboard, wacom, etc. Basically my workstation has been fall out\nI tried to restart de SMC and PRAM.

Nothing helped.\n\nA: So I have been getting same error when trying to install windows with bootcamp but I managed to bypass it. Usually I would choose win iso image, choose size for windows partition and click next. Software would begin to download but soon after the error would show up.

Once I do screen share works correctly.\nMy issue is I need to access it without being there to accept the invitation to screen share. It’s my understanding that as long as I’m using the same Apple ID then it should just automatically connect. Note that it does this when I connect on the same local network, but not remotely.\nBoth machines have a login with the same full name and password but different ‘usernames’ that is the short 1 word username is different.

Weird as Time Machine is supposed to delete old backups as needed to store the new ones.\nSo, I tried to just reformat using Disk Utility and start fresh. That failed with the error message \"disk could not be unmounted\".\nNext, I tried to make space myself by going into the backup folder and deleted a few of the older dated folders. It took forever to delete a folder via Cmd+Backspace, literally over 30min. :-( I tried instant delete (Cmd+Opt+Backspace) but it wasn't faster and failed on a folder with the the message \"items had to be skipped\" and the tip to unlock. The folder in question is not listed as locked though. On to the Terminal with \"rm -rf folder\" which resulted in \"permission denied\". Sudo of the same command just changed the error message to \"operation not permitted\".\nIt's also weird because the deleted folders are still shown in Finder - some processes still running. Only about 30GB on a 500GB disk have been freed so far (20 left initially to 50 now).\nThe especially troublesome folder I tried the \"rm\" on stands out as it has different permissions. All folders show \"drwxr-xr-x@  3 root  wheel\" while this one reads \"drwxr-xrwx@  3 root  wheel\". Some of the deletion processes are still shown in Finder as ongoing.\nHow can I just reformat that disk and be done with the nitty gritty?\nSecond best, how can I weed out by hand and delete some of the older backups, getting past the above snags?\nSystem: Catalina 10.15.6\n\nA: You can try this method. it has worked in the past. Open your Time Machine backup disk and then Enter Time Machine using the Time Machine icon in the menu bar. Now you should be in Time Machine with a list of the backups. Select one of the backups and then look for a gear icon near the header of the backup you selected. Click on this gear icon and it should have an option to delete that backup. If you open a Time Machine folder you can use the gear icon to delete that folder. Here is what the gear icon looks like:\n\n\nA: You shouldn't use Finder or terminal's rm to delete Time Machine backups, as they're in a special format.\nIf you just want to reformat your TM backup drive, just unplug it (because it won't eject/unmount on its own), then plug it back in and erase it with Disk Utility.\n\nA: None of the above worked for me in the end. Access to the disk with Mac software was so jumbled up that I couldn't  sort this out with Finder, Disk Utility, or Terminal. My solution in the end was to circumvent the blockage by formatting it using a blunt Windows tool. It just ignored everything on the old backup disk and erased it. Voila. Not elegant but at least I can use the disk again for a fresh backup.\n\nA: It's storage problem. Go do some research on \"How to delate Time machine backup on mac\"\nHere is my solve:\n\n*\n\n*Get the Time machine disabled.\n\n*Use terminal to delate old backups in Time machine.\n\n", "Q: Apple Watch Cellular activation in China I went to an Apple store in Shanghai/China to buy an apple watch with cellular and they told me I'll not be able to use it because SIM card providers (i.e. China Unicom, China mobile) require Chinese ID (which foreigners don't have) to unlock the cellular feature. The issue is not buy the SIM card but to put both iPhone and Watch on the same number.\nIt seems the eSIM (used by watch) is not that welcome in China. New iPhones are coming without it and instead hold two physical SIM cards.\nOne option would be to ask a chinese friend to buy a SIM card for me.\nWhat other options are there?\n(This whole story looks like the lock I use to see on phones years ago)\n\nA: Note that there's no slot for a physical SIM card on the Apple Watch. You must add the SIM card to your iPhone. This can either be a physical SIM card, or a virtual SIM-card known as an eSIM. An eSIM usually takes the form of a letter or email containing a QR-code that you scan with the camera in your phone.\nIf you have a recent iPhone, you can add both a physical SIM and an eSIM to your phone at the same time. So it might be easiest to ask your friend to purchase an eSIM, and scan the code on your phone.\nNote: In some places it could be illegal to get others to buy phone services in order to circumvent legislation.\nAlso note that there exists different models of the Watch that supports different radio bands - the watch you have bought in Shanghai probably won't work with cellular in North America. Apple has a list of the models and bands here:\nhttps://www.apple.com/watch/cellular/#table-series-6\nApple's lists here that there are unique restrictions on Apple Watch cellular usage in China - stating that for China Mobile you can only use it with subscriptions opened in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Tianjin, while for Chine Tleecom it can only be used with subscriptions opened in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wuhan.\n", "Q: How to make Karabiner work with Intellij on Mac? I've recently switched from Windows/Ubuntu to MacOS Catalina and I'm trying to avoid changing too many key mappings on Intellij 2020.2.\nI'm trying to achieve these things:\n\n*\n\n*Swap Left Ctrl and Fn\n\n*Having function keys as default in touch bar when using Intellij to be able to use combinations like Ctrl + F4 in Intellij without having to press any additional (Fn) keys\n\n*(If possible) Map Ctrl + click to something other than Right Click\n\nHere's what I've done so far:\n\n*\n\n*Swap Left Ctrl and Fn using Karabiner\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Function Keys > Add Intellij\n\n*Imported a complex modification in Karabiner to change Ctrl + click to just click.\n\nThe issues that I'm facing:\n\n*\n\n*Pressing original Fn (mapped to Left Ctrl) in Intellij changes touch bar from Function keys to other touch bar options. I'd like to disable this to be able to use Ctrl+F4.\n\n*Left Ctrl+Click still behaves as right click.\n\n\nA: You can edit the Karabiner rules to ignore IntelliJ completely, then, you can use IntelliJ's keymaps to change keys as you want.\nYou can also create your own rules in Karabiner to remap keys for IntelliJ if you want.\nThe Karabiner config file is located in ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json, and editing it is not to complex, you can use comparators like frontmost_application_unless and frontmost_application_if to select which app the keymap applies to.\nWhat I did was to import some predefined keymaps to understand the file format, and use them as examples for modifying the ones I was interested in.\nFor example, for Ctrl+C it was this, so you can adapt it for your needs:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Copy Command (Except IntelliJ IDEs)\",\n  \"manipulators\": [\n    {\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"bundle_identifiers\": [\n            \"^com\\\\.jetbrains\\\\..*$\"\n          ],\n          \"type\": \"frontmost_application_unless\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"from\": {\n        \"key_code\": \"c\",\n        \"modifiers\": {\n          \"mandatory\": [\n            \"control\"\n          ],\n          \"optional\": [\n            \"any\"\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      \"to\": [\n        {\n          \"key_code\": \"c\",\n          \"modifiers\": [\n            \"left_command\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"basic\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n", "Q: Wiped all disks for Ubuntu installation, but \"macOS Recovery over the Internet\" still knows my Wi-Fi password I wiped all disks for Ubuntu installation.

The error messages are slightly different whether in Safari directly or an in-app browser -\nIn-app browser says 'You cannot browse this page at \"....\" because it is restricted'\nSafari says 'Safari cannot open the page. The error was: \"The URL was blocked by a content filter\".'\nShe was previously using a 1st gen iPad mini (ios9) and has her own limited/child Apple ID. On the iPad she would attempt to visit a website and upon being notified it was blocked, you could click a link to enter the parental password and unblock that site. Since restoring onto the iPhone it seems some of those restrictions have been passed on, in that some sites are accessible but others aren't. The problem is that when seeing an inaccessible site on iOS12, there is no direct link to unblock it.\nScreen time was not set up initially, however upon turning this on, and either setting content restrictions to completely disabled, or having it enabled but having web contact set to unrestricted, or having web content limited but with specific urls in the 'always allow' section, I'm seeing the same behaviour whatever I do.\nWhere else can I adjust these types of settings?\nEdit: I've noticed in settings/safari that favourites are greyed out and set to 'allowed sites' I can view any site which is already listed in favourites but cannot find anywhere to edit the favourites.\n\nA: You are using the new ScreenTime for iCloud (this is different from the local ScreenTime you have disabled). It sounds like the local restrictions on the iPad has been passed on to the limited Apple-ID and then stored on iCloud. The limited Apple-ID has a builtin ScreenTime which stores its settings on iCloud and overrides the local ScreenTime.\nThere are two ways of controlling ScreenTime for iCloud.\n\n*\n\n*From another iPhone with a parent account signed in with. Open settings app, click on parent name at the top. Scroll down to Family Sharing and select your child's limited Apple-ID. At the bottom you can turn off ScreenTime for iCloud. You may also from this screen change limits (e.g. allowing websites e.t.c.).\n\n*From the limited iPhone. Open settings app, click on the name of the child at the top.

It works perfectly fine with my windows laptop.\nI now need to connect my work MacBook Pro provided to me, but under the list of resolutions (and extended hidden resolutions) none of them come close.\nIs it a matter of the cable I'm using? I'm using a HDMI cable with a usb-c adaptor on the end to connect it to the MacBook.\n\nA: Besides the other answer, you might have better results with a DisplayPort cable if your monitor supports it. My 3440x1440 monitor for instance works at 100hz with DisplayPort and only 60hz with HDMI.\n\nA: Yes, the cable is very important. Some HDMI cables do not support a 4k display signal at all, and some only at a lower refresh rate of 30 Hz. You definitely want a version 2.0 or higher HDMI cable capable of support 4k at 60 Hz.\n\nA: I usually follow along this closely and have excellent success.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202351\nOnce you confirm how the display works and how you want to convert it to Thunderbolt 3 you can shop for adapters / cables and get rolling. The current (2019/2020) hardware can run one 6K, one 5K, or up to two 4K displays (or better).\nAs for specifics I tend to choose high quality adapters and cables.

My reasoning for this is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*It asked for your credentials, which indicates the goal was phishing not infecting your devices\n\n*Drive-by infections are not impossible, but they're also not easy. Unless you're a high profile target it's unlikely you would ever interact with one.\n\nI don't believe there is any reason to be concerned based on how you described this.\n", "Q: Terminal - different window colors? Here's an obscure one, it used to be that if you ...\n\n*\n\n*opened a window A (say, green bg, your default)\n\n*open another window B\n\n*open prefs\n\n*change the bg color in prefs to yellow\n\n*that would change B to yellow, but leave the other one green\n\nIn this way you could fairly easily have mulitiple Terminal windows, with, different bg colors for clarity.\nUnfortunately Apple fixed this bug a couple yrs ago!  Changing color in prefs now changes all open windows!\nIs there any way to get different color backgrounds in Terminal when more than one window is open?\n\n(Do note, you can set that BACKGROUND windows have low alpha (look at, strangely, the bottom of the color pane.  This doesn't help at all.  If I have four shells to four servers, I want them to have red, green, blue, yellow backgrounds. Thanks!)\n\nA: You should make four shell profiles by using the duplicate option and create your shells from those different profiles.\nEdit: There are other answers with alternatives that may better suit different use cases. This way is still going to be the nicest approach for consistent re-use of color sets.\n\n\nA: Ah!  Terminal now includes this:\n\nThat menu option alone DOES offer \"individual\" background color change.

Prior to Catalina (10.15) (at least in 10.14), you could click on a checkbox and it'd tick it (even if the PDF wasn't a fillable PDF). You could also click near a line and Preview would identify that there was a line there and insert a text object automatically.\nAm I missing something, or were these features removed?\n\nA: I've confirmed that this feature was removed in Catalina.\nFor confirmation you can see on in the Preview User Guide from Apple.\nIf you check the Mojave (10.14) version, it says \"Click a field or a line in the form. A text annotation box automatically appears.\".\nIf you switch over to the Catalina (10.15) version, it now only says \"Click a field in the form, then type your text.\".\n\n\n", "Q: Is there a difference in performance between a the default scaling option and selecting a resolution? I just got a new 27\" 4k monitor. At default resolution, text and menu items are too small for me to be usable. In the display settings, there are options to \"Scale\" the resolution, but this comes with a notice that scaling may negatively impact performance.\nI've seen online that one can option-click on the Scaled radio button and get a drop down of resolutions. I've done this and selected 2560x1440 and this is comfortable for me.\nMy question is: does the mechanism for choosing a different resolution via the drop down not degrade performance the way the default scaling options does? Or is it essentially doing the same thing, just via a different way of selecting the scaling?\nIn case it's helpful, I have two MacBook computers that I use this display for, with the following GPU information from the system report:\n\n*\n\n*My work MacBook Pro 13\", 2019, with Intel Iris Plus 655 GPU.\n\n*My personal 2019 MacBook Air 13\" with Intel UHD Graphics 617.\n\n\nA: Changing your resolution doesn't really affect performance.  What will give the effect of improving or reducing performance is refresh rate.  A higher refresh rate will smooth things out giving you the \"feeling\" that things are much faster.  A lower one will make things look more \"jumpy\" thus giving the effect of lagging performance.\nThe default scaling is what macOS has determined to be the \"best\" optically for your particular setup.\n", "Q: Canon MP140 Printer driver for Catalina Is anyone able to install a generic printer driver for old Canon printers? I have an old MP140 for which Canon is no longer updating drivers. My Mac doesn't automatically find any drivers so I'm stuck trying to add the printer without any drivers - which my Mac keeps me from doing by graying out the Add button:\n\nI'm hoping to find a way to get this printer running with some generic 3rd (4th even!) party software. I tried connecting the printer via USB cable and ran into the same problem.\n\nA: It's unlikely you'll find a generic printer driver for this particular model.\n\"Generic\" printers use languages like PCL (Printer Command Language) (Developed by HP), or Postscript (developed by Adobe).  Additionally, they could emulate other printers like \"HP LaserJet,\" \"Epson,\" and even \"IBM.\"  There are some Canon printers that do have this type of emulation support like the BJC-210, however, I can find no documentation whatsoever for the MP140.\nJust as an aside, there are generic PPDs (CUPS Printer Description/Definition) for Canon Postscript printers.\nOn the scanner side of things, I did find that the scanner is  TWAIN / WIA compliant.  You should be able to find generic TWAIN drivers, but WIA (Windows Image Acquisition) is Windows only.  While TWAIN drivers for Mac will exist, the problem is most are 32 bit making them incompatible with Catalina (I obviously don't have a MP140 to test to see if it's natively recognized).\nMy recommendation is to retire it.  It's obviously a quality product, but unfortunately it's hamstrung by a lack of \"pro grade\" features like Postscript and PCL printer languages.  When shopping for your next replacement printer, go a step up and get something geared for business and not consumers.  The consumables will be less and the lifespan much longer (I have an old Datamax label printer that still works because of PCL compatibility; it's not even USB!)\n", "Q: MacBook on macOS Catalina 10.15.7 not returning disk space after deletion So I believe I have a drive requiring FSCK or a version of this for Catalina. This started first of all when I was trying to get rid of purgeable space by creating lots of files using the dd if=blah blah of=/users/user/bigfiles/bigfile1 etc etc. When I deleted these files I didn't get my disk space back. Even now deleting large video files has no effect, in fact any deletion gets only minimal space recovery or none at all.\nI have tried all the usual tricks \"First Aid\" (in recovery mode) and all the disk checks I know how to do, booted into single user mode etc, and run utilities like ONYX, but even though it didn't fix my disk it seemed to find something wrong. Can anyone please shed some light of the results?\nAlso some people have suggested this is a local Time machine backup issue so I deleted all my local backups and verified there are none there.\nAs you can see I have some errors when I scan disk Macintosh HD - Data, I get a bunch of\nwarning: xf: INO_EXT_TYPE_DSTREAM: found unexpected stream associated with non-regular file\n\nand then a load of\nwarning; FOUND ORPHAN DSTREAM IDOBJECT (id 384942334 (or whatever) refcnt 1)\n\nThe volume /dev/rdisk2s1 appears to be ok\nAs you can then see from the next screen shot 478GB used and 600MB free\nRebooting into multi user mode I looked at the local snapshots.\nI had already deleted all my local snapshots and can show there are none left with:\nsudo tmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n....and get nothing listed...\nNext I run Daisydisk and you can see 0.5GB free so I scan the disk and see that:\n498GB total used but if you add the items shown you only get approx 260GB so apparently 240GB has been eaten by the system and hidden somewhere.\nAny ideas?\nRegards\nP.S. so I couldn't work out how to insert multiple files (screen shots and a PDF) so here is a link to a Onedrive directory with them in it.\nhttps://silverfoxpc-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/royswift/EoMj7wW0uwtJroUuQWXTfMMBYQVlkbmmRhUsJacEvc4nIw?e=bQ5DJF\n\nA: couldn't fix this so I reformatted the drive and reinstalled and now I am in the middle of a Time Machine recovery.\n", "Q: How to check battery capacity of a new phone (iPhone SE)? So I just bought an iPhone SE in an unofficial store (new packaging and everything, warranty, etc.). The only problem with the phone is, the battery life seems super short to me. In settings -> battery -> battery health it says 100% capacity. But could somebody have taken out the new battery out of the phone and replaced it with an old one before packaging, and for some reason the phone still thinks the battery is at 100% health?\nHow can I make sure the battery is indeed old before I go to an official store and tell them to replace my phone? What ways are there to check the capacity?\nP.S. a rip-off like this maybe couldn't happen in America, but I don't live in America so this is possible, in my opinion.\nAnd yes, I have closed apps and tried different ways of minimizing battery consumption, yet the battery life still seems to me way too short for a new phone.\n\nA: There's no way to check to see if the battery is genuine without opening it up and visually inspecting it.\nWhen the battery gives you it's capacity, it's basing that on a moment-in-time measurement of the battery's charge against a known capacity value (1624 mAh for the iPhone SE; 1821 mAh for 2020 SE). Any 3rd party battery can have that capacity, but how they discharge is what makes the difference (quality of the cells).\nThat said, there are many reasons for quick discharge of your battery: an update to iOS may have a bug, apps being open or utilizing too much resources, etc.  For example, my own iPhone started exhibiting poor battery life the moment I upgraded to iOS 14.  I confirmed it by restoring a backup from iOS 13.\nThat said, \"way to short\" is very subjective - you need to define what way to short is in terms of hours of use compared to what Apple publishes.  However, it's been reported that battery life is a \"Major Letdown\" when compared to other manufacturers.  So, based on how you use the phone and the factors mentioned above, YMMV with respect to battery life.\nIf you're concerned that the battery may not be genuine, the only way is to physically open it and have an Apple technician inspect it.\n", "Q: How to format Hard Drive and reinstall Catalina from USB I have a disk that's so full I cannot install Catalina in Recovery mode as there is not enough space.

In my local Outlook for Mac client, I've deleted my old account and added the new one. But there is still a single calendar out of my control that didn't get migrated AFAIK that I would like to have on my Outlook Calendar. But if I re-add my old account, I get double of all my old emails.\nIs there a way to tell Outlook for Mac to sync just the calendar from a certain account and not the emails for that account? I know you can do this in the native Apple Mail/Calendar clients thru the Internet Accounts settings.\n\nA: Short answer is no. When you add an account on Outlook it will add everything in the account that it has access to without a way of disabling one component.\nGetting back to your question though, you could potentially add the Google calendar onto your Outlook web app (visit outlook.com and follow steps to add a shared calendar) - however that would only give you read access to the calendar.\nSo you have a lot of options of where to go from here:\n\n*\n\n*You can export the Google calendar contents into an Outlook calendar and find a method of importing the events.\n\n\n*You can add the Google calendar as a read-only shared calendar inside the Outlook web app which will then sync to your Outlook desktop and Mobile clients.\n\n\n*You can add your Outlook Exchange account AND your Google calendars on the Apple Internet Accounts section and use the Built in Calendar app instead of the one inside Outlook.\n\n\n*You could go on your old Google Apps/G Suite account and move all your inbox items and sub folders into a Old Email folder of some sort, then at least it's out of your line of sight.\nKeep in mind when IT decides to cancel the G Suite accounts your old calendar will be gone! So plan ahead.. it costs around $6/month per account, so it's only a matter of time before they decide the cost is not worth keeping it around.\n\nA: In System Preferences → Internet Accounts, select the account you want, then chose what you would like to have synchronized.\n\nFor example, in this account, I am only syncing Contacts.  So, add your out of date account and select to only sync the calendar that you're interested in.\n", "Q: IOS 14 - I stopped receiving text notifications while I’m on a phone call.

I was on a phone call, looking away from my phone, relying on text sound notifications to alert me. When the sound alert stopped, I missed a bunch of text messages. I think I found the fix. Settings>Sound and Haptics. Move the Ringer and Alerts slide from left (mute) to right so sound is allowed.\n", "Q: How to edit \"kMDItemXxx\" file metadata on macOS? Today I tried to edit the metadata of a picture file. I used mdls to display them, then looked for a command to edit one. But I couldn't find any.\nFor vanilla metadata, like basic timestamps, touch is good enough. And for these things called \"extended attributes\" (quarantine, etc.), macOS gives you xattr -d.\nBut is there a CLI way to edit, say, kMDItemBitsPerSample or kMDItemFSName, or the key/value pairs used by Spotlight?\n\nA: The Spotlight system collects a variety of types of metadata about files. Some kinds of metadata are what I'd call \"superficial\", and can be easily changed by changing the file properties; but some \"deeper\" ones depend on the contents of the file, and cannot be changed without significant changes to the file itself.\nkMDItemFSName is an example of a \"superficial\" attribute -- it's just the filename, so renaming the file will change it. kMDItemBitsPerSample, on the other hand, is a property of the data in the file (it's the bit depth of an image or audio file). Changing kMDItemBitsPerSample would involve some sort of recoding of the image or audio file.\nMind you, there are some attributes that are in-between in superficiality. For example, mp3 files include metadata like the album name (kMDItemAlbum) and track number (kMDItemAudioTrackNumber) that are part of the file's contents, but can be edited (by some apps, like the old iTunes) without touching the audio content of the file.\n", "Q: How to run an installed application as an admin? Background\nI'm running Catalina 10.15.7.\nI run my macOS system as a limited user (I have admin credentials for admin tasks).\nThis mostly works fine, but it seems many apps, and sometimes Apple themselves, expect most users to be running their systems as admins.\nProblem\nAnyway, I had a program installed (Disk Drill), which was running fine, and then prompted me to install an update.  I installed the update, and now when I run the program I get an error window that Disk Drill can only be run by admins and then the app exits.\nIf I launch a terminal window and switch to the admin user and launch the app from the terminal, it starts just fine.\nQuestion\nHow do I get this app to run as an admin?\nAttempted Solutions\nI tried changing ownership of the .app and .app/Contents folder to that of the admin user, but this didn't seem to make any difference.\n\nA: On macOS the Finder hands off application starts to an admin cleared process named launchd. You don’t really have to do anything to run as admin since all apps run as admin when programmed to do so. What macOS does differently than windows is sandbox details and some files being immutable / read only / protected.\nThe closest analogous item might be adding the disk drill app to Full Disk Access, but I would check with the vendor and release notes before adding it unless you are sure it’s working correctly or have a backup.\nThis message isn’t really correct on macOS and wasn’t on OS X before either.\n\nA: I used the terminal to temporarily run the program in question as superuser/root to solve this.\nIn my case PyCharm CE asked to be run as a privileged user to update itself.\nI looked for PyCharm CE in the /Applications - folder (use ls /Applications to search).\nFor the cases I have encountered it follows a particular structure where there is a command to run the program in the folder /Applications/<app name>.app/Contents/MacOS\nwhich I run as superuser/root with sudo:\nsudo /Applications/PyCharm\\ CE.app/Contents/MacOS/pycharm\n\n(The \\ backslash is because there is a space in the name.)\nI would then update it from within the program itself, exit and restart it as a normal user.\n\nA: The more general, and imo useful, answer here is given in the selected answer, and that is that if a program in macOS complains about not being able to run as a Standard User, it's either an intentional design decision, or, more likely, lazy or incorrect code that does not follow the macOS security paradigm.\nEither way, you probably won't find a solution within the OS, but rather, by contacting the developer directly and asking them to \"fix\" their code.\nIf you're looking for a more specific answer as to what happened with my Disk Drill problem, read on:\nFinal Updates\nI neglected to update this thread so I'll provide a summary here. Disk Drill did attempt to give me workarounds, but I wasn't getting a firm commitment about plans to actually fix this issue. After a couple more emails where I explained that:\n\n*\n\n*Disk Drill used to work fine before under a Standard User account,\n\n*There is no technical reason why Disk Drill should not be able to run from a Standard User in MacOS (thanks to explanations given here in the selected answer), and\n\n*Running a system as a Standard User is a common and fairly routine security best practices,\n\nI guess my emails were finally forwarded to the right person because as of November 9, 2020 I was told that the developers were \"going to fix the issue in the next update\".\nSatisfied with that response, I kind of forgot about the issue because I didn't actually need Disk Drill at that moment. Well, today (January 28, 2021) I decided to download the latest version of Disk Drill from their website and I'm happy to report that it seems to work just fine running as a Standard User under MacOS Big Sur (11.1).\n", "Q: The \"2Do\" application shows a blue dot in app's titlebar on macOS - what is it for? What does the blue dot next to the other red/yellow/green dots do in the title bar of 2Do on macOS?\n\n\nA: The button is specific to the app \"2Do\" which you're running. It is not a general macOS \"thing\".\nYou are not the first person to ask why the meaning of the dot is, or what it does (if anything) when pressed. For example there's a Reddit thread about it here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/aw08z5/what_does_this_blue_button_next_to_the_traffic/\nHowever even though the manual for 2Do shows a screenshots with this blue dot - it is not explained what the purpose of it is.\nI would suggest contacting the support for 2Do to find out more!\n", "Q: Has Catalina broken the logging into external machines? So I've been trying to login to servers and MySQL databases recently and it seems that they all come back with either no error or no connection available errors, and I'm wondering how exactly one would go about fixing this.\nI'm running MacOS v10.15.5 (19F101) [Catalina] on an iMac with a 3.6 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i3 processor (pc serial C02D80Y207F1.) I've attempted to login to countless servers and services away from the computer which have worked on other machines as well as try to use and login-to services including ftp, sftp, mysql which have failed on my mac but not the other machines not running Catalina.\nI'm hoping to try to get some information on either why this is happening or if this is just a bug on my computer- perhaps a misconfiguration?

The problem must be local to your machine or your network. I regularly use the commands you mention (ssh and mysql) to connect to external machines from a Mac running Catalina - so in general it works just fine.\nI would start by ensuring that you have:\na) a working internet connection (you can browse web sites from the Mac)\nb) not running Little Snitch or similar software that blocks outgoing connections\nc) not running a firewall or similar on your router or network that blocks your external connections\nThen debug by examining exactly what doesn't work:\na) can you ping the IP address of the server you want to connect to?\nb) can you ping the host name of the server you want to connect to?\nc) can you connect to other ports on the server (for example a web site)?\nd) does the server log tell you anything when you try connect?\ne) if everything fails, use tcpdump on the Mac and on the server to see network packets going back and forth\nFrom there it should be possible to figure out what the problem with your setup is.\n", "Q: How to stop using Time Capsule as router? I have a Comcast router XB-6T and it's supposed to be better/faster than using my Time Capsule/802.11ac as a router. I'm on a iMac running High Sierra 10.13.6.\nCurrently I thought I was using my TC as a router in bridge mode (however the Comcast guy set it up and the TC says bridge mode off).  I am not very hardware literate but I'd like to make sure I'm using the Comcast router.  We do have Ethernet cables plugged into the back of the TC that goes to other rooms/devices and one USB on the back of the TC that goes to a printer.\nI'd like to know if someone can give me instructions how to no longer use my TC as a router and instead use the Comcast router. I'd like to keep the same Network Name and would also need to know if I need to move any/all of the Ethernet cables from the back of the TC and plug them into the Comcast router instead; I don't know if there is enough availability.\nCurrently the back of my TC the slots are all full. If it makes more sense not to mess with it then I won't. Can someone advise what would be best to do and how to do it?\n\nA: \nI have a Comcast router XB-6T and it's suppose to be better/faster than using my Time Capsule/802.11ac as a router.\n\nBetter/faster is very subjective.  You need to define what \"better\" and \"faster\" mean to you.  But for comparison:\n\n*\n\n*Both are 802.11ac devices\n\n*Both have Gigabit WAN connection (the XB-6 claims \"a maximum\" of 1 GB throughput)\n\n*Both have Gigabit Ethernet ports.  Apple has 3, Xfinity has 2\n\n*Both have dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) radios\n\nSo, from a performance perspective, there's really nothing that stands out.\n\nWe do have Ethernet cables plugged into the back of the TC that goes to other rooms/devices and one USB on the back of the TC that goes to a printer.\n\nWhether or not you have Ethernet cables plugged into the TC or the XB really doesn't matter.  The TC is plugged into the XB (it must be if you have Internet) then regardless of which device you plug into, they're all Gigabit, so there's no advantage to doing this.  The XB6 doesn't mention USB, so you'll want your TC to act as a print server.\n\nI'd like to know if someone can give me instructions how to no longer use my TC as a router and instead use the Comcast router but also I'd like to keep the same Network Name\n\nIn order to configure your Airport Time Capsule, you need the Airport Utility and related documentation:\n\n*\n\n*Airport Utility 6.3.1 for Mac\n\n*Airport Utility 5.6.1 for Windows\n\n*Airport Utility Users Guide\nWe don't know and cannot support your Xfiniti device.  If you want to use that device with the same name as your Time Capsule, you'll need to consult their support options.  That said, if you wish to use their WiFi, you have to make sure the WiFi on the TC is either\n\n*\n\n*turned off; or...\n\n*set up in \"client mode\".\n\nThere's detailed information on how to do this in this Support Document.  If this is not something you're good with and/or don't know how exactly you want it configured, I highly suggest getting a local tech person to come out and set this up. There's simply too many variables for a succinct answer in this medium.  Additionally, there's no way of knowing how the XB is configured to properly advise you how to configure the TC.\nBottom Line....\nIf WiFi on your TC is working fine, then there's no reason to change.  In other words, if you're satisfied with the performance, there's no need to do anything.  If you want to maximize the efficiency and coverage of your WiFi, you need to bring in someone familiar with this kind of work.\n", "Q: How to confirm that a cloned external hard drive is accurately cloned? I've used Carbon Copy Cloner to copy one external SSD, which is currently about to die, to another one. I also have an online backup of the external drive, but I want to confirm that my cloned copy is exactly the same as the old one.\nI can compare individual files using md5sum.

Here's my commands:\n\n*\n\n*hashdeep -rel -r . > hashdeep-outout.txt\nHashdeep (which you can install via homebrew) will create a CSV file listing each individual file with various hashes including MD5 and SHA256. -rel lists the files with the relative path to the CWD, so I can run this command on both the old drive, and the new cloned drive, and the file names will be identical.\n\n\n*sort --field-separator=',' --key=4 hashdeep-output.txt > hashdeep-sorted.txt\nThis sorts the CSV file by filename (the 4th field), so that when I compare the two files (for the old drive, and the new drive) everything will be in the same order.\n\n\n*Then I use just diff to compare the sorted output files.

I recently paid $150 to get the hard drive replaced, and approximately 3 days in, I get another one. This time it happened when I opened up the program \"FL Studio\" for music, and I don't know if this is a reoccurring theme, but it always used to happen before also. Specifically FL Studio. It's either it would shut my computer off with a kernel panic as soon as I open it, or it would shut off about 20 minutes of use into it. What do I do? Was it a hard drive error? I read the report and it said \"Fault CPU\" and I don't know what I means.

things down to the culprit.\nHere are some tips:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you're running the latest version of FL Studio as they often resolve crashing/memory issues, etc on newer revisions of software. There were others who mentioned having Kernel panic issues with Mojave and the update was suggested: https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-download/\n\n*Run the Hardware Test on your system by restarting your computer with the D key held down (D for diagnostics). https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202731\n\n*Listen for other clues such as overheating issues -- if the crash happens after you hear major fan noise, or after a hot day, or if you're doing intense work it may be related to overheating. The old systems will get dust and such in the fans and can overheat more easily. If you feel up to it you can open the bottom of the Mac mini and spray compressed air in the various areas - especially around the fan.\n\n*See if crashing occurs elsewhere as well -- if it's always when using FL Studio, target your attention there.\n\n*BACKUP! Make extra sure you've got good backups going on -- the first drive crash was the reminder, now you'll want to make extra sure going forward that you can recover from another potential crash.\n\nNote: Other potential causes for Kernel panics - Faulty or dirty fan, CPU/GPU issues such as on some of the MacBook Pros the thermal paste started coming loose and causing overheating, RAM issues, data corruption on the drive, application you're running has bugs. The data corruption on the drive is the least likely culprit as you've recently replaced the drive and I'm guessing reinstalled the system software fresh onto the new drive.\n", "Q: How to run Windows 10 from USB on my Mac? I need to create a portable windows To Go workplace for my job and make it runs on a Mac computer, i tried WinToUSB tool and it didn't work, it keeps stucking at 0% when creating Windows to Go with a USB 3.0, so, is there any other way or tools that can create a WTG drive that can be boot and run on a mac?\n\nA: I don't think this is an ideal situation to answer your question, but we run Windows 10 in VMware fusion and you can store the files on external USB. It's easy to set up, clear support path, but you have to install software and have a license for it so it's not something you can show up to the Mac and boot - leave no trace behind.\nCheck out the personal use license for VMware Fusion Player to get started while you wait for someone smarter than me to weigh in with how to do precisely what you ask or explain why it won't work.\n\n*\n\n*https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal\nMaybe a solution like this would help?\n\nA: According to the Microsoft document Windows To Go: feature overview, Windows To Go was removed in Windows 10, version 2004. So you would need to ISO from a earlier version of Windows 10. However, this document also states running a Windows To Go workspace on a Mac computer is not a supported scenario\nThe newer model Macs can run Windows 10 from an external HDD or SSD. These types of installations are not designed to be used on multiple machines. Therefore, I assume you are not interested in this type of installation.\n", "Q: Autocomplete in Chrome Browser, not sure if its Mac OS or Chrome Every time I type \"Th\" in a text field within my Chrome browser, an autocomplete prompt of \"Thanks\" pops up. I've dug around and can't figure it if its a Chrome, plugin, or a macOS thing but its incredibly irritating. Any help please?\n\n\nA: This is called \"Text Replacements\" and it's a function/feature of macOS.\nThis feature will work on any app that uses the Cocoa interface; so apps that use it like all native Apple Apps and 3rd party apps like Chrome will be able to use this functionality.  Apps that don't use Cocoa like Microsoft Word or Firefox won't be able to use Text Replacements.\nTo remove it (stop it from happening), open System Preferences → Keyboard → Text and remove the entry for \"th\". I just tried adding it, and it behaved exactly as you described. It even tried to intercept it as I typed it here until I removed the entry.\n\n", "Q: Can a Mail.app smart mailbox take *nesting* into account? I'm using the fairly old version 9.3 of Mail.app on a computer running El Capitan; I just set up my Gmail account with it, and it seems to be correctly syncing.\nFor organization purposes, I would love to have a smart mailbox that simply contains every message not in another specific mailbox (edit: that is, a folder), which I'll call A. The problem is that I don't keep any messages directly in A -- I keep them in A's sub-mailboxes (sub-folders) B, C, etc, and the sub-sub-mailboxes of those in turn. So the smart mailbox is not very useful.\nIs there any way I can make my dream a reality: A mailbox that only lists messages that are not inside Mailbox A at any level?\n\nA: A Smart Mailbox with the rule Any recipient does not contain [email address of mailbox A] should work. The use of subfolders shouldn't impact this.\nOr just add Account [accountName] for each mailbox that you DO want to include (excluding mailbox A).\n", "Q: iMac goes to sleep because the battery has 0% left I've got an iMac 5k (Ultimo 2014) running Mojave.

This does not require that you delete your existing data and should be non-destructive. However, backups are always good to have.\nReboot into recovery mode (instructions are available on Apple's Website). Ensure that the installer shown in recovery mode is for Mojave (if not, then the system may be updated or downgraded when you do this!). Run the Install macOS option in Recovery mode and choose your existing disk.\nIt will install macOS on top of your disk, but leave your data in place.\n", "Q: Connecting an external camera to iPhone XI, then using it for Skype and Zoom using a smart TV as a screen My boss asked me this question but I think that's entirely impossible.\nHe wants to replicate his iphone screen on a Samsung Smart TV, then, using his Skype / Zoom / Teams app in the Iphone, call people and put the iphone on the table and let people see him from an external webcam. connected to the iphone via bluetooth or wifi. What do you think about? Thank you\n\nA: You should be able to do this with the Apple Digital AV Adapter as it allows you to connect an external monitor to your iPhone/iPad device.  That would be the most efficient method.\nThe second method to do this would be to utilize an AppleTV  connected to the external monitor/TV.  You would then AirPlay the Zoom meeting to AppleTV.  This would meet your requirements of being wireless, but keep in mind that in an office environment where there's lots of demand for WiFi, you may see a choppy video due to network latency and dropped packets.  If possible, create a dedicated VLAN with QoS (quality of service) configured to put priority on that traffic.\nA third option would be to simply get an inexpensive Mac like a Mac mini and connect the screen along with a quality webcam like the Logitech Brio or if the room is large enough, one of their \"pro grade\" conference web cams.\n\nA: There are a number of software solutions that will help you use your iPhone as a webcam. Combining that with screen sharing or HDMI connection from your Mac/Windows to TV or device like Apple TV would likely be the easiest method.\nI recommend you google 'iphone webcam' for a number of good links, otherwise currently (Oct 2020), Kinoni's EpocCam, and Reincubate's Camo appear to be two very good solutions:\nhttps://www.kinoni.com/\nhttps://reincubate.com/camo/\n", "Q: Access 'About this Mac' before creating a user I've wiped and reinstalled macOS in order to sell a 2017 MacBook Pro. Of course, I forgot to take a screenshot of 'About This Mac' to get all the specifics (all I need is the CPU variant).\nI've booted into Recovery Mode to access terminal and try a host of variations on system_profiler. None of them work.\nI don't want to have to create a user just to view my specs and then have to wipe and reinstall macOS again.\nDoes anyone have a working 2020 method for accessing system information from the terminal before creating a user?\n\nA: Use sysctl command to get the CPU brand string.\n% sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string\nmachdep.cpu.brand_string: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-700K CPU @ 4.20GHz\n\n", "Q: ECG Setup in Apple Watch I have installed latest iOS version on my iPhone as well as on Apple Watch. However I don’t see set up option for ECG app in Health app in iPhone. What do I do.\n\nA: ECG availability depends on where you live.\nApple has a list at https://www.apple.com/lae/watchos/feature-availability/#branded-ecg\n", "Q: Changed DMG password now it won't open Hardware: Hackintosh running Mavericks.\nProblem: I had a DMG where I store (stored...) stuff I obviously wanted to keep private, so I unchecked the \"Save in my keychain\" option.\nSome weeks ago, beginning to upgrade all my passwords (iPad, phone etc) to something less crackable (like the 6-digit iPhone lock screen) I changed the password of said DMG to a very long new one. I did it following the instructions in Disk Utility.\nYesterday I tried to open it but it said \"Try again\" a few times until the \"Authentication error\" window appeared.\nI'm very careful with passwords and they are always stored. When I change them I keep the previous one, etc. But I might have screwed this one up because neither password works.\nWhat I did after the change is rename the DMG with a password hint. But when it wouldn't open, I renamed it back to its previous name. Nothing worked.\nAnd since I am thorough with backups too, I updated both backups with the new DMG... so none of them work...\nNow the central question: since I did all this on my desktop computer, could I overcome this with some kind of log file, or anything of the sort stored somewhere in my drive? Of course I have full admin access.\nI took it to my Macbook running Catalina but no luck there either.\nThanks to all !\n\nA: The password used for encrypting the DMG is not stored in a log file or similar. Having full admin access doesn't help you, I'm afraid.\nThe only real resort is to brute-force the passphrase for the DMG. It seems you have a pretty good idea of what the password is and how long it is - that should make brute-forcing worthwhile to try. I'm assuming here that you made a typo when setting the password or something similar to that.\n", "Q: iMac main partition disappeared after deleting a different partition So, I created a 20GB partition in my iMac to install Ubuntu. That worked fine, but then it turned out I needed a bit more space for the software I wanted to install, so I turned the computer off and rebooted on the main partition (Mac HD, I believe). I then deleted the 20 Gb partition, and I'm sure that's the one I deleted because I triple checked it's size, just in case. Something weird happened right away, the Mac HD partition was now being recognized as an external drive. I didn't think too much of it though, as I was more worried about the fact that those 20GB of space apparently weren't available. I then decided to restart the computer, maybe that would fix the issue. Well, the Linux partition was still there but the Mac HD option was gone -.-\nBoth regular and Safe boot take me to a grub command line, as well as booting the Linux partition, so it seems I actually erased it. Running diagnostics (Command-R and D keys on startup) tells me everything is fine. I also tried reseting the PRAM, to no effect.\nI started the Ubuntu installation process, just to see if it would work, and when choosing where to install it there's an empty 20GB \"partition\" of free space, which I imagine corresponds to the partition I created and then erased, as well as 230GB partition, of which an 'unknown' amount is used.\nIs there any hope of recovering the disk? I don't have a complete backup of the system, only a semi-recent backup of important work. I can live with losing some stuff, but I'd rather try to salvage it if possible, it will be quite a nuisance reinstalling all the software I use on a regular basis. If there's a way, how would I go about it? Also, if you have any idea of what might have caused this, I'd love to know.\nThanks in advance!\nEDIT:\nSince no one has answered I decided to give a blind try at this, let's hope I didn't screw up.\nInterestingly, while the first time i used diskutilthe main partition was disk2, it now seems to be disk14.

I wasn't thinking and put my computer on top of the monitor while it was in it's case, kind of like a bookstand. I noticed a weird noise (like a 'computing' sound if you will) coming from the machine and assumed it was just the intensive processes I was running. It started to get quite annoying until I realized that the noise went away when I removed the laptop from off the case. I also regularly travel with the folded case and computer in close proximity. Am I endangering my computer by having this case anywhere around it? Is there anyway to check for damage? I seem to have all my files and the computer works fine.\n\nA: No, a permanent magnet of any reasonable size would not damage your computer.\nYou are not endangering your computer by having the case near the computer.\nThe SSD in your computer is not affected by magnets of that type at all.\n\nA: Permanent magnets have no significant effect on SSD drive based Macs, but note that this is NOT correct for a Mac with a spinning hard drive; a magnet could permanently delete data on that hard drive.\nIt can likely impact speaker sound (or cause speaker sound) as the speakers have tiny magnets themselves. It likely won't harm the speaker (it could pull the speaker cone beyond its range and break it, if there is enough travel room) but as your experience proves, you might hear weird sounds.  Since there are really no other moving parts and DRAM etc are not magnetic in nature, there are few things in current Macs that are impacted by strong magnets.\nAlso note that Macs include permanent magnets in their screen and base, to enable the screen to turn off when closed, so having magnets nearby is not an issue.\n", "Q: iOS can’t add some widgets to home screen I have downloaded iOS 14 and really like the new widgets, but I can’t add some widgets to my home screen.

NordVPN's 'Quick connect' widget is a 'Today extension', while for the widget to work on the Home Screen it must be a 'Widget extension'. This terminology is even more confusing since 'Widget extensions' can appear on the Today View (but only at the top, above the older Today extensions).\nSee e.g. the Human Interface Guidelines for some background, but it's all quite technical. I expect most major app developers to convert their extensions, but they do have to support users on iOS 13 and lower (where the new widgets won't work), so it might take a while.\n\nNOTE\nToday widgets designed for iOS 13 and earlier aren’t available on the Home screen, but remain accessible at the bottom of the Today View and in the macOS Notification Center.\n\n", "Q: Is there a known fix for apps that suddenly stop delivering notifications for any obvious reason? For several years now, I've noticed a really strange thing with notifications delivered from third-party apps on iOS - whereby they will just stop without any obvious reason. When checking within Settings/Notifications, nothing whatsoever has changed - all settings are as they should be. The immediately obvious steps (a device reboot and opening the app in question) don't resolve this - the only way of getting notifications back for the app in question is to remove it completely, and then reinstall it from the App Store. Whilst this isn't a big issue for apps that I'm only interested in notifications for (news apps are a good example), apps that require configuration are less ideal.

Thus changing the creation date on the directories (folders).\nObviously '/path/to/parent/folder' will need to be defined, literally or tokenized, and again without seeing what you already have, I'm not going to waste time guessing, to offer variations on the example shell script code.\n", "Q: How to show \"only mails with attachments\" in MacOS Mail?

I wanted to disable the boot/power on by opening the lid. To do so, I entered the below command in the terminal\nsudo nvram AutoBoot=%03\n\nPost that, I shut down the laptop by going to the Top Left Apple icon. After shut down, I closed the lid. I opened the lid and Voila, it showed the battery indicator 100% on the screen and then the screen went dark. Reasonable, but not for me. This is where my problem starts, as my laptop won't start anymore.\nI have taken the below troubleshooting steps.\n\n*\n\n*Press the Power Button\n\n*Press and Hold the Power Button from 3-10 seconds, (tried all)\n\n*Tried resetting NVRAM\n\n*Tried resetting the SMC, ^ Control ⇧ Shift ⌥ Option ⦿ Power for 10 seconds.\n( I am not sure about SMC reset, as the power was not turning on)\n\n*Opened the back lid, disconnected battery connectors for 60 hrs, hoping SMC would reset.

I am posting a question after a long time, apologies for any improper format.\n\nA: The setting is stored in NVRAM, so resetting that should undo the new nvram setting. Unfortunately in this case, NVRAM is persisted like something written to disk, so neither SMC nor disconnecting the power can undo the setting.\nTry using the automatic power on as part of the NVRAM reset.

I have some text replacement shortcuts configured in my keyboard settings, such as for example ur -> you are. They generally work fine, but in some cases they are not triggered only by spaces or punctuation, but also by alphanumeric characters. When I write in Romanian, for example, the plural of foreign words is formed by adding -uri (e.g. \"1 like\" -> \"2 like-uri\"). When I'm using Messenger on Chrome, this triggers text replacement and becomes \"2 like-you arei\". This doesn't happen on StackExchange, but it does happen on Messenger. Is there anything I can do to make this stop? Or could it be a bug? It's really annoying and it makes it hard to write in Romanian.\n\nA: \nWhen I'm using Messenger on Chrome, this triggers text replacement and becomes \"2 like-you arei\". This doesn't happen on StackExchange, but it does happen on Messenger.\n\nText Replacements work on apps that utilize the Cocoa interface.  This means any Apple application and any third party app like Chrome, will have text Replacements compatability.\nTo better control the replacement triggering as  well as gain functionality whether or not you're using a Cocoa based app, you need an an app like Text Expander ($3.33/mo) or aText ($5).   Both can be configured to use a short cut, a hot hey, or  delimiter (like Tab) to trigger it.  So in your example, you'd have to type \"ur\" followed by Tab for it to trigger.  Firefox, however doesn't  support it.\nAn alternate method would be to put a special character in front of your replacement pattern like a tilde (~) or a an exclamation  mark (!) as its highly unlikely you'll ever type that sequence of characters as a \"normal\" sequence.  This has the advantage of being free, but you don't get the increased functionality of the 3rd party apps like customized triggers and universal availability (not limited to Cocoa based apps)\n", "Q: Most times when I install something it asks to be dragged into applications I kind of get the general idea from this question Why do I have to drag my new apps into the application folder? that I've just unpacked an archive I downloaded.\nbut I'm wanting to understand what the alternatives for me are and any benefits of dragging the unpacked application to a different \"folder\" of my choosing. Is there an advantage to creating separate task oriented folders at all?\nTrying to get comfortable with my imac, but I keep forgetting that dragging into \"applications\" does not actually complete the installation. So why are the web download install experiences not just a one click and you are done activity? (I would use the store, but the app store far too often shows me other unrelated apps above the one I am looking for/ wastes time /distracts me too.) I feel I'm missing some obvious flexible decision point?\n\nA: It's just a convention that adds a layer of security.\nSome apps like VirtualBox, for example have an install script that will do this for you, so obviously it can be done. However, if you have to manually do this, there's no way an inadvertent double click will install the App.\nSecondly, apps can be installed for both users system wide or for individual users (~/Applications) so this manual step gives you a choice of which Applications folder you wish to install it to.\n“Completing the installation” is a misnomer here on macOS.  Unlike Program Files on Windows, you don’t have to have a special place to run an app. You can put that app bundle  almost anywhere (obviously not protected volumes) and have it work.

I was trying to set up Apple Mail on my Mac because someone emailed me a .eml file that I seem to need Apple Mail in order to open. When I tried setting up my Gmail account in Apple Mail, it asked me to give permission for the app to read, edit, and delete emails.\nWhat I Want To Know: Under what circumstances would Apple Mail actually delete my emails from a Gmail account that I set up with it? Would it only be when I manually delete them in the Apple Mail app?\n\nA: The .eml file is a mail file that is based on the MIME RFC 822 specification.  It's basically a text format that pretty much all Mail applications can open\n\n*\n\n*Outlook (macOS, Windows, iOS, Android) / Outlook Express (Windows Only)\n\n*Microsoft Mail (Windows 10)\n\n*Apple Mail (macOS)\n\n*Mozilla Thunderbird\nRegarding your question, you don't need to setup a Gmail acccount (or any account for that matter) to read a single .eml file.

Then use airplay to stream the content of your iPhone to the Apple TV. I personally like this option as then you have a smart projector with plenty of options for playing content without your phone or computer.\nOption 2) Get an Apple Lightning Digital AV Adapter, which then plugs into your iPhone's lightning port and gives you an HDMI port.

How to sharpen? When I try to resize (shrink, in this case) and/or rotate a PNG file, it becomes very blurry.  Besides (obviously) not wanting a blurry image, it's actually critical because these are shipping labels with bar codes and the image is so bad, bar code readers actually have trouble with them.\nThe command that I am using is\n% convert input_file.png -resize 288 -rotate -90 output_file.png\n\n\n*\n\n*-resize 288 → resize to a width of 288 pixels (4 inches) keeping the aspect ratio.  288 is the number of pixels for a 72DPI (printing) resolution\n\n*-rotate -90 → rotates the whole image anti-clockwise 90°\n\nThe file that you get from eBay, USPS Click-n-Ship, or PayPal is a 4x6 inch label either in PNG or PDF.  I choose PNG since I need to rotate it as I'm using my laser printer with letter sized labels (Avery 8127).  I have to resize it because the PNG they provide is huge! Looking at the size in Preview, it's 17x25 inches.\nI have researched this extensively, but the solutions I've found only marginally improve the sharpness of image.  The end result is that depending on the bar code reader it may or may not read it.  For example, I have two readers - a simple 2D Symbol bar code reader that more often than not will fail.  However, my more expensive Focus 3D reader will read it more often, but still sometimes fail.\n\n*\n\n*Imagemagick converted image is blurry\n\n\n*ImageMagick v6 Examples -- Blurring and Sharpening Images\n\n\n*Blurry resized PNG. How do I keep the quality the image?\n\n\n*ImageMagick v6 Examples -- Resize or Scaling (General Techniques)\nFrom this page\n\nHowever, many filters (even the default filters) can blur images slightly. It is part of their nature. So normally this 'short-circuit' for a no-op resize a good thing.\n\nNone of these worked.\nI was under the impression that if I make an image smaller, I wouldn't lose quality however, this doesn't seem to be the case. So, my question is, how can I resize this image so that I can retain the quality?\n\nA: The trick here is to increase the density(resolution) of the original image before doing any other processing like resizing or rotating.\n% convert -density 300 inputfile.png inputfile.png\n\nNormally, it would be necessary to specify the units (-units PixelsPerInch or -units PixelsPerCentimeter) along with density, but since PNG files only use the pixels /cm unit, it's not necessary here.\nThe reason we have to do this is because to resize an image, it must pass through one (or more) of several filters (algorithms).  With a low resolution (like 72 dpi for printing) there simply isn't enough data for the algorithms to use for their calculations.  ImageMagick has a lenghthy section on resizing and the different filters you can use and how they work:  https://legacy.imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/#other.  Unfortunately, none worked well enough until I realized that the data in the image was just too \"thin.\"\nBy doing nothing other than increasing the density we're essentially giving the same element (a single bar code line for example) more data points to work with when we do manipulate the image later on.  The more it has, the more accurate it can be though the trade off is speed.  It will take longer to process.\nBy doing this first and then manipulating the image, I was able to achieve a crisp and clear image at the size I needed for printing on my laser printer.  The other option I had was to purchase a dedicated label printer (like the Zebra or Brother printers) so I could use the high quality PDF they supplied.\nBelow is a more step-by-step process of how to manipulate the image to get the desired result\n\nIf we look at the resolution of the original image file (identify -ping -verbose image.png | head) we see that it's set for a resolution of 28.35x28.35 ppcm and a print size of 42.328cm x 63.4921cm (16.66\" x 25\").\n  Filename: sample_label_orig.png\n  Format: PNG (Portable Network Graphics)\n  Mime type: image/png\n  Class: PseudoClass\n  Geometry: 1200x1800+0+0\n  Resolution: 28.35x28.35\n  Print size: 42.328x63.4921\n  Units: PixelsPerCentimeter\n  Colorspace: Gray\n\nSince everything is metric, to convert to inches, multiply by 2.54.  28 ppcm translates to 72 ppi (or 72 DPI).  This is supposedly the correct DPI for printing.\n You can use the same filename for both input and output so it makes the changes \"in place.\" I'm using a separate file for this example.\n% convert -density 300 sample_label_orig.png sample_label.png \n\nWhen the density/resolution is increased to 300 ppcm, everything falls into place.

Note that geometry not the print size of the label.  It's the dimensions of the label multiplied by the density.  So, a 4x6 inch label would be 10.16x15.24 cm meaning the final geometry would be 300*(10.15x15.24) = 3048x4572.\n% convert sample_label.png -geometry 3048x4572 label_out.png\n\nNow, when we look at the details of the label (identify -ping -verbose label_out.png | head), everything is as it should be.

I'd like to move most of those contacts to iCloud and allow her contacts to be synced from both servers.\nWhen I go into Contacts > Groups, I see one line for Exchange and another for iCloud. If I check the iCloud line, all her contacts on the phone vanish, which indicates to me that the phone is getting contacts from iCloud only.\nCan someone explain to me what is going on here, and how to do what I'm trying to do?\n\nA: There's some things that still aren't that easy to do on an iPhone/iPad and require the use of a Mac (or PC, however steps are harder) to accomplish.\nTwo parts to your question - first off going into Contacts--> Groups is simply a way to turn on and off certain groups of contacts so you are only seeing the groups you want to see. In your situation you would want to have the checkmarks ON next to all the Groups, otherwise you will see the behavior you are describing (accidentally hiding exchange contacts).\nNext, in order to get the Exchange contacts migrated over to iCloud the easiest method is to get ahold of a Mac and follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*(Optional) If this is not your computer, or it's shared with others, consider creating a fresh user account for your Wife in order to do this task so it doesn't mix up content with other people. To do so Click Apple menu in upper left and go to System Preferences. Then click Users & Groups. Click the lock symbol in the bottom left and unlock the window pane with the computer's password. Then click the + sign in the bottom left and create a new user account for your wife to use for this task. Sign out of the account and into her account -- skip through the setup assistant the best you can, but do sign into her iCloud account.\n\n*Go to System Preferences, then click on Internet Accounts.\n\n*Add an exchange account and sign in with your wife's info. Then enable the info you are hoping to transfer - in this case just the Contacts.\n\n*If you didn't do it in the setup assistant, add your wife's iCloud account and make sure to enable Contacts.\n\n*Open the Contacts application on the dock and look to see if both her iCloud contacts and her Exchange contacts show up ok.\n\n*If they do, click on the Exchange section where it says \"All Exchange\". Select all (Command, A on the keyboard) or edit menu, select all. Then drag them onto the iCloud section and be patient as it copies over.\n\nOnce you've copied over the Exchange contacts to iCloud, you can then go back to the iPhone and enable the contacts for both Exchange and iCloud in the Settings--> Passwords & Accounts section. Or if you're running iOS 14 or newer it would be in Settings--> Contacts, then click Accounts near the top and make sure Contacts is enabled on both Exchange and iCloud.\n(Optional) Last tip that helps a lot - in the same Contacts settings page as mentioned above, you can look for the option \"Default Account\". Once you find it set her default account for contacts to iCloud. Doing that will help her out a lot in the future as new contacts will go on her iCloud.\nI love Exchange but have never felt comfortable putting my personal contacts onto a workplace email account that I could lose access to on a moments notice - hence my recommendation for her to set the default contacts to iCloud.\n\nRegarding setup if you don't have a Mac, you can use a newer browser like Chrome/Firefox/Edge, and sign into iCloud.\nSelect the Contacts section and in the bottom left is a cog that will give you the option to \"Import Vcard\".\nNext is the convoluted process of exporting the contacts as a multiple contacts vCard which basically involves exporting the contacts as a CSV file out of Outlook, then using Gmail's import process, then exporting them back out as a Vcard for Apple products.\nHere's reference for those steps: https://www.msoutlook.info/question/803\nAfterwards you would get that long sought after group Vcard you created with the steps mentioned above and upload it into iCloud.\nLastly jump back up to my steps mentioned after 6. and you'll be all set from there.\n", "Q: Passwordless SSH between MacOS and MacOS not working I know there are many tutorials, including instructions on this forum but I find that SSH still asks me for a password.\nHere is what I tried on the local machine:\nssh-keygen -t rsa                   #   Generate Key Pair, accepting all defaults\nssh-copy-id me@192.168.1.235        #   Copy to remote\nssh me@192.168.1.235                #   Still asks for password\n\nI have also tried with a custom key:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/test.rsa\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/test.rsa.pub me@192.168.1.235\nssh-add ~/.ssh/test.rsa\nssh -i ~/.ssh/test.rsa me@192.168.1.235\n\nIn the remote host, I have changed the privileges to authorized_keys:\nchmod 600 authorized_keys\n\nI have tried all the variations to copy the key to the remote server, but they all give me the same results, and the authorized_keys file has the same new key.\nMany of the tutorials are several years old, and some are for linux, so I don’t know whether things should be different.\nIs there an extra step I need to take to use SSH without a password?\nI am on MacOS Catalina.\nUpdate\nI have turned on verbosity, and I get something like this:\ndebug1: rekey in after 134217728 blocks\ndebug1: Will attempt key: /Users/me/.ssh/test.rsa RSA SHA256:…etc…\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO received\ndebug1: kex_input_ext_info: server-sig-algs=<ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa,rsa-sha2-256,rsa-sha2-512,ssh-dss,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521>\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive\ndebug1: Next authentication method: publickey\ndebug1: Offering public key: /Users/mark/.ssh/test.rsa RSA SHA256:…etc… explicit\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive\ndebug1: Next authentication method: keyboard-interactive\n\n\n\nA: If you tell your config file about the setup it will work.\nOpen ~/.ssh/config\nAdd this:\nHost whateverYouWannaCallIt\n  Hostname      192.168.1.235\n  User          me\n  IdentityFile  ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nThen you can do this:\nssh whateverYouWannaCallIt\n\nI recommend when creating the ssh key, to not use a generic one and give it a name for the machine, so one key per computer.

The description stated that this would allow not only video and audio through the display up to 8K, but also would allow charging at the same time due to the bidirectional function of the cable. So far the image and audio are great and as described, but the charging is not working.\nDoes anyone have experience with this? Is there a way I can enable my Macbook Pro to allow the incoming charging through this? I needed a good cable anyway, so if it only does the single function that is fine, but was hoping to limit my usage of the ports and charge and display through a single connection.\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nA: \nIs there a way I can enable my MacBook Pro to allow the incoming charging through this?\n\nThere's is not setting to allow incoming charging because charging is, by design, allowed.  It's a defacto function of the port.\nI think you're misunderstanding how the Thunderbolt port works.  It's a multiplexing of several signals - DisplayPort, USB 3.2, PCIe, and Power.  It doesn't stop doing one when it's functioning as another.  In other words, it doesn't lose the ability to charge and be charged if you plug in a monitor.\nFor your Mac to be able to be charge while your monitor is plugged in, you need the following:\n\n*\n\n*A monitor that supports it (i.e. the LG UltraFine monitors that were designed for Apple/macOS)\n\n*An active Thunderbolt/USB-C cable.  Note that all Thunderbolt 3 cables are USB-C cables, but only quality USB-C cables are Thunderbolt. Active cables support 40Gbs transfer at 2m (6.5 ft.) while passive cables, which are less costly are limited to .5m (1.6 ft.).\n\nA quick review of the technical specifications page for your monitor makes no reference to \"power delivery\" or \"charging.\"  It's also not mentioned in the product description.  If you look at the LG UltraFine specifications page from the link above, you'll notice it specifically mentions \"Thunderbolt 3 with 94W PD.\"\n\nIf your monitor doesn't send power to charge your computer, no cable in the world will make this work.\n", "Q: What user info does Apple disclose to third party app developers, once a user purchases an app? what kind of privacy related info is exposed to third party app developers, if I downloaded and purchase their app?\nFor example:\n\n*\n\n*Physical SIM card info (e.g, Phone number)\n\n\n*iPhone board info (e.g, IMEI number)\n\n\n*My Apple ID\n\n\n*My name and address that I provided Apple as part of the required additional payment information (Like shipping address, even though the apps are not getting \"shipped\" to me, or my PayPal email address)\n\n\n*My MAC address (can it be blocked on iOS 14?)\n\n\n*Info related to the Wifi router I often connect to at my home\n\n\n*Cookies and cache - How may I track and delete them? for example, I deleted an app that had permission to use my location, but when I re-downloaded it, I didn't have to give it permission again, which means there is some kind of cache somewhere.\nI want to get a very clear picture of what kind of info those apps can collect and store about me to identify me in future time.\nThis is also relevant in case someone buys a used phone, what steps are required to start a \"fresh\" page when it comes to any of such apps, so the user does not get confused with the previous owner?\n\nA: \nWhat user info does Apple disclose to third party app developers, once a user purchases an app?\n\nThe short answer is it depends.\nIt depends on what the App developer claims it needs to collect.  Apple doesn't sell your data nor will it give out data \"willy nilly.\"  But if a product/service that you want requires the sharing of data, Apple will share it.\nFrom Apple's Legal page concerning Privacy:\n\nDisclosure to Third Parties\nAt times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers. When we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws. Apple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. For example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device. If you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.\n\nTo put this another way - Apple will share what is necessary to provide you with the product/service you're requesting.  If there is a 3rd party, your private info they have will be governed by their privacy policy.\nAs for your data with respect to individual apps, what gets shared depends on what the App itself is requesting.  However, it's Apple's policy that you be made aware of what personal info the app  requires\n\nApp guidelines\nOn the App Store, Apple requires app developers to adhere by specific guidelines designed to protect user privacy and security. Apple also requires them to provide a privacy policy that you can review. When Apple becomes aware of an app that violates our guidelines, the developer must address the issue or the app will be removed from the App Store. Apps go through a review process before becoming available on the App Store.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\nIn short, the App you purchase can obtain/use any/all the information you described in your question. However, they must make you aware of it.  They may not need nor do you want an App to have have access to PayPal addresses, however, if the App says they collect it, they can.  If they do collect it and don't tell you that would be a violation of Apple's Privacy Policy.\nOn the other side of that coin, your data that they collected (in accordance with Apple's policies) are now governed by their privacy policy.  So, if on the App store, they say that they collect your personal information like a Social Security number, and then turn around and sell it, they may be well within their rights to do so if that's what it says in their policy.\nBottom Line\nBefore purchasing/installing an app, check to see what info the app collects.  Many people marvel at how many free apps there are on the App store not realizing the hidden cost - their privacy.  App developers want to get paid for their work and if they're not charging you anything up front or have in-app purchases, the app isn't the product they're selling - you are.\n\nA: I don't provide citations for all of the below, but for many of these it's simply impossible to prove a negative with a primary source. Apple doesn't list all the data developers can't get, since that would be an infinitely long list.\n--\nIMEI, MAC, phone numbers, etc. are not available to developers: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/31122 (unsure since when for MAC - I don't believe IMEI has ever been available)\n\nApps cannot view your name, email, address, billing info, etc. This would be a reportable security vulnerability if an app found a way to do this.\nApps also cannot access your web browsing data (cookies, etc.).\n\nPrior to iOS 14, apps could use CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo to access network SSID.\nStarting with iOS 14, apps must meet one of the following conditions for SSID access:\n\n*\n\n*The app uses Core Location, and has the user’s authorization to use location information.\n\n*The app uses the NEHotspotConfiguration API to configure the current Wi-Fi network.\n\n*The app has an active VPN configuration installed.\n\n*The app has an active NEDNSSettingsManager configuration installed.\n\nAll of these require explicit user action to authorize.\n\n\nI deleted an app that had permission to use my location, but when I re-downloaded it, I didn't have to give it permission again, which means there is some kind of cache somewhere.\n\nApps must re-request location access. I'm not sure what you did but permissions are reset when apps are deleted - perhaps there's a short delay or cache, but the app wouldn't control it and I'm certain that at least after a restart the app wouldn't have that permission when reinstalled.\n", "Q: Can I use Time Machine to Mirror two Macs?

What's the best file system that I can use for an external HD which I want to use on both a macOS system, and a linux system? I can transfer files using sneaker-net much faster than through an AFP or SMB network share, but I need a file system which both operating systems can read and write.\n\nA: Depending on the complexity of the file structure you want to store and other properties you might like - the easiest way to go is to use exFAT.\nexFAT is fully, natively supported both read and write on macOS, and has been so since Snow Leopard 10.6.5 (from 2010).\nOn Linux the native support came with version 5.4 (from 2019). Your specific distribution might not yet be running 5.4 - in that case a FUSE implementation is available instead.\nNote that exFAT is not well suited if you want to transfer file structures where you want to retain a lot of file permissions/ACLs, or if you have the need for a journaled file system (a file system that is more resilient to power failures and similar crashes).\nIn that case you might want to look into using APFS instead. APFS is the native file system used by default on modern macOS versions. It is however not supported directly by Linux.\nInstead you can buy third-party support from Paragon Software.\n", "Q: What is APFS \"Disk User\" and how to add multiple crypto users via diskutil?

(see fdesetup help for details)\n\n\n*You can add or change the recovery key after the fact using fdesetup changerecovery\n\n\n*You can remove users later using fdesetup remove and you can also remove the recovery key with fdesetup removerecovery\nI don't yet know how to add or remove users/keys to encrypted apfs disks that are not the boot volume.\nLong Version:\nThe convention of having multiple cryptographic users on a disk was done primarily to facilitate FileVault boot disks. Because of this convention, the concept of a disk \"user\" was created to allow disks to be encrypted with a single encryption key for non-boot disks.\nThe disk \"user\" is what would be created if you encrypted a disk using a method other than the \"Turn on FileVault\" method you described above. This is the equivalent of having a disk encrypted by a single password, instead of having multiple users able to decrypt the disk with their own passwords.\nHaving multiple users able to decrypt a disk is important for a startup disk with FileVault as it allows them to enter their own username and password at boot to decrypt the disk and login. Without it, they would have to know the disk encryption password (the disk \"user\") and enter that at boot, then login with their own user credentials at the login screen once boot is complete.\nThis is why FileVault automatically adds additional encryption keys for users to your boot drive when you enable it (in this case, one for your user and one for the FileVault master recovery key in case a user forgets their password and needs to reset it). But if you are encrypting a non-startup disk, having access for multiple users may not be useful or even desirable. This is why encrypting the disk from the CLI only creates the disk \"user\". (I believe this is also the case when encrypting using the Disk Utility app or from the Finder).\nYou can, of course, encrypt a boot disk with only a single disk \"user\" and no other cryptographic users or recovery keys. You will be presented with a password prompt at boot and it will display a disk icon instead of a user icon, and you will have to enter the disk encryption password instead of your user password. Any users on the machine who do not know this password will be unable to decrypt the disk and login to the machine.\nEdit: Just want to add the following:\nNote that the disk \"user\" will only be added to the list of cryptographic users when you first encrypt the disk using the cli (diskutil apfs) or via Finder or Disk Utility. The disk user will not be added if you enable FileVault in the System Preferences, and it cannot later be added to a disk that already has cryptographic users.\nAlso of note, the disk user will always have the UUID of the disk itself.\n", "Q: Every time I start my terminal, I get \".zshrc:source:18: no such file or directory: /sourceme.sh\"? I've been trying to download some softwares. I've deleted those files, but now, I think my zsh file keeps wanting to source a file that's no longer there. Because of that, I get the following message every time I open up my terminal:\n\nThis is really annoying, and I'd like to get rid of it somehow... Thanks!\n\nA: I was able to solve this issue with the following steps:\nOpen .zshrc and edit it. This can be done with the following:\nsudo nano ~/.zshrc\n\nFrom here, you may find a file, whatever it may be named (in this case, it was sourceme.sh). Delete the line that was installed in there. There are many reasons it's in there using nano. Then, save.\nWhere sourceme.sh came from: I downloaded another program that automatically wrote that line in when I configured it, and when I deleted, it could no longer find that file. It could be any other shell script (.sh).\n\nA: The solution that worked for me is the following:\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_resolving-shell-environment-fails\n", "Q: Lexmark E210 Printer install from .ppd file I am excited at the prospect to enable Lexmark E210 printing from Catalina.\nThe E210 \"Seems to be a relabeled Samsung ML-4500.\"\nPPD file can be downloaded from this link.  PPD instructions link for older versions.\nI think the PPD file a set of instructions for the OS to download & install the driver?\nI think it belongs in:\n/Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources\n\n\nYikes!  The .ppd file throws an error:\n\nGuidance, references, lesson-learned are all appreciated.  I have experience installing Windows drivers, however, this is new territory for me.\nDiagnostic Screenshots for Allan:\nMaybe there is a permissions obstacle?\n\nI suspect that it is necessary to resole the connection error above in order for the .ppd file to execute.  Until then:\n\n\nA: This should work.\nThe key here is that it uses the gdi driver; though it's no longer maintained by Samsung, it is is community maintained and appears to have current support.  It's also built into Ghostscript, so it should be there.\nThe short answer is you should be able to manually add the printer using one of the printer models listed on the driver page (link above).\nManually Installing on macOS\nThe location for the (English) PPD files is /Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/en.lproj.  Simply copy your PPD file there.\nWhen you Add your printer, the very last field labeled \"Use\" will be where you specify your driver.  From the drop down, choose \"Select Software\" (left image).  A list of printer software will open (right image).  Start typing the name of the driver you copied in the filter box at the top; you should find your printer.\n \nNote:  In my example, I used \"localhost\" as I currently don't have the printer hooked up to my network, but you would use the IP address of the printer.  As for protocol, use \"LPD\" for these older printers.\nPrinter Drivers\nOne thing you should note is that not all printers are created equal.  It may seem trivial, but depending on engine that drives your printer, you may or may not be able to continue using them.  For example, this printer uses a \"Host Based Printing System.\"\n\nThis means that it's the operating system the local computer that actually does all the rendering of the graphics, not the printer itself.  It's a cost saving move for the manufacturer.  The downside is you have a good chance of this becoming a paperweight down the road.  Fortunately, this was based on a processor from Samsung that had continued support (they also sold this one to Fuji/Xerox)\nGoing Forward...\nWhen purchasing a new printer, be sure to look for a printer that has support for printing languages like PCL and/or Postscript.  If it supports both, it's even better!  If it supports emulations like \"HP LaserJet\" or \"Epson\" or even \"IBM\" you can use those generic drivers as well.  These printers do cost a little more, but they make up for it in longevity.\n", "Q: Is it possible to backup an iOS 7.1.2 device on OSX 10.12, 10.13, or 10.15?

Cannot vouch for it but it's much easier than\nhacking XML.\nIt seems to use sh -c for all commands though, so not sure why that is.\nlaunchd plist generator\nhttp://launched.zerowidth.com/\n\n\nA: It seems you've come up with a very convoluted solution to the problem of not wanting a bash_history.\nI would advise that instead of periodically clearing the history from launchd, you should simply disable history recording:\necho 'set +o history' >> ~/.bashrc\n\nClose the terminal tab and open a new one - and your history will no longer be recorded.\n\nA: Your bash history consists of two \"histories\", not one. One of these histories is stored in a file - its size/depth is governed by the parameter HISTFILESIZE. The other history is cached in memory - its size is governed by the parameter HISTSIZE.\nYou can check the sizes/depth of your histories:\n$ echo $HISTFILESIZE \n$ echo $HISTSIZE\n\nThe reason for two histories is that one is associated with each shell session (HISTSIZE), while the other history is a file ~/.bash_history that is \"permanent\", and eventually receives the session histories when they overrun their max depth, or when the session is terminated. That's a bit complicated to explain, and the picture below may help make the relationship between these two histories clear.\nBut back to your objective:\nRather than taking steps to delete your history, you could simply set HISTSIZE\nand HISTFILESIZE to zero in ~/.bashrc:\nHISTSIZE=0\nHISTFILESIZE=0\n\nIf that's not what you want, you can certainly delete the history file periodically, but know that doesn't delete the session history. Deleting your history file by building a .plist file isn't necessary. The history command is the tool to use for this job (see history --help for details). The following command will delete one session history:\n$ history -cw\n\nDeleting the contents from the history file (~/.bash_history) is done conventionally:\n$ > ~/.bash_history\n\nYou could put one or both of these commands in a crontab, but you'll need to ensure the default shell is bash as history is a built-in.\nFor some related background on the subject of shell history, you could read this related Q&A. It pertains to zsh - not bash, but the principles are the same.\n\n", "Q: iMac 27 How to restore a SSD made invisible after formatting a fusion drive from APFS to HFS+ I bought a used Imac 27 with APFS fusion drive mOdel Identifier iMac15,1 before discovering the previous owner had replaced the original 512 Gb SSD by third party one with an adapter.

Can I delete everything and start again?\nSurely the back overwrites the data and not add more to it. Please help.\n\nA: You paid for a 750 GB backup drive, so Time Machine uses all the storage on it. If you used it for say 5 years, and you still have 86GB free, then every version of every file that ever was on your Mac is still in your Time Machine backup somewhere.\nWhen all the empty space is gone, Time Machine will delete the oldest backups until there is enough space for the next backup, and from then on your backup drive will always stay almost full. So you can restore older files for many years.\n\nA: Time Machine maintains a complete record over time. When you delete something on your HDD/SSD it's gone there, and the space is freed up. But on Time Machine, the deleted files are retained. Why? Well - imagine you deleted those files accidentally... you'd expect Time Machine to cover that error. And so it does.\nAt some point, Time Machine will begin deleting older records when it detects that you are about to run out of space on your backup drive.

Is there an option to stream the file and upload using hdiutil create?\n\nA: It doesn't immediately seem possible, no.\nThe hdiutil tool itself has no option to write to stdout.\nIt cannot be tricked by using /dev/fd/1 as the output file either.\nCreating a named pipe using the mkfifo command doesn't work, as the hdiutil checks for the existence of the file before starting.\nIn this case it is possible easier for you to simply stream over the raw disk contents, and then convert it to a dmg on the receiving end (depending on which utilities you have available there). In your case it is a simple dmg file, so converting it is just a matter of adding a small footer structure to the end of the file after transferring it.\nYou could transfer the raw data using a command like:\ndd if=/dev/rdisk3 bs=1m | curl -TX - PUT -H \"Authorization: Token\" --output /dev/null \"https://uploadlink.com\"\n\n", "Q: MBP water damage diagnosis I accidentally spilled water on to my 2017 MacBook Pro (Touch bar) (keyboard and trackpad), and because I panicked a bit I used the immediate reboot key (shift+control+option+command+power) instead of holding the power key for a few second, which delayed the time until complete power off for about 15 seconds (because the MBP restarted and I didn't notice that until the power chime).

Water spill damage is 'not good', but the effects can vary depending on what part got wet, for how long, whether it was powered, etc, etc, etc.\nHowever, I would not expect the machine to last as long as a 'dry' Mac, nor would I rely on it.\nThere are two main issues: one is electrical shorting, where current travels across the water, damaging the components. This usually happens instantly. The extent of damage and the importance of the component can vary: a problem with a sensor could well be a result of this.\nIf sufficient damage has occurred, then the Mac can be completely lifeless.\nThe other is corrosion from salts in the water that are left behind after the water has evaporated. This is a more long-term issue, and may cause increasing problems with use and time.\nIn short: after water damage, you should take the Mac in to an Apple Repair shop for investigation.\n\"In the worst case, can I still recover my data?\"\nIn 2007, Apple introduced Time Machine as a feature in OS X Leopard. Every file that you want to keep should be on one or more backup copies. This website bears testimony to frequent accidental deletions, catastrophic hardware failures, thefts, fires, etc, etc.\nIf you do not have a backup, you should try to get your files off the laptop onto one (or more) external drive as soon as possible while it still works. Your Mac has its storage soldered directly on to the logic board, so data recovery will be expensive.\n", "Q: One workout missing from phone Yesterday I did two workouts using my Series 6 AW. One HIIT and one walk. Today, when I look at the fitness app on the phone, only one of the workouts is there, the HIIT. Is there any way to force the other to sync?\nI’ve restarted both devices.\n\nA: It appears that as of today (Oct 23, 2020), this is a known bug.  Apple is aware of the issue but no GM fix has been issues yet.  It's been reported that un-pairing/re-pairing the AW doesn't resolve the issue.\nThere's a Watch and iPhone OS versions in beta right now, you can try installing one of those to see if it fixes the problem (installing beta OS's has its own risks so be sure you're aware of them before installing).\nOtherwise, you'll have to wait until Apple puts the fix out for everyone.\n", "Q: Double-clicking on a song in Finder launches Music.app but doesn't play it Back in the day of iTunes, when double-clicking on a song in Finder it oppened iTunes and started playing it.\nNow, using Music, the same action only open Music and copies the song into it.

It's certainly worthwhile making sure you've got an external bootable install media for emergencies.\nAlso, there's not really any point in 'resetting' the Recovery partition and the entire disk itself: erasing the system/user volume and reinstalling using the Recovery partition will suffice to put the Mac back to a 'brand new' state.\n", "Q: Adding a startup script on Big Sur I want to install a startup item in OS X Big Sur which runs a shell script as a user on my machine and connects via ssh to a remote machine I maintain.

I also don't really want to go through all the trouble of installing a userscript manager just for this, especially since Safari's not very friendly to extension developers and often breaks them every update, and (probably because of this) developers don't seem to care for supporting Safari.\nHow can I select part of a link in Safari nowadays?\n\nA: Not the most eloquent way of doing it but still delivers results without any extension.\nHover over link, open contextual menu (two finger press), select 'Inspect Element' (this will open split window and land you on selected element),\n\ndouble click on text between span tags (to make text field 'active'), copy needed part of text, close split window.\n\n", "Q: Stopping false positive malware warnings in Catalina? Today, I received a pop-up warning saying \"hpRaster.bundle will damage your computer. You should move it to the Trash\".\n\"hpRaster.bundle\" is installed by Mac OS X as part of its drivers for my HP Laserjet P1102w printer.\nI ran a malware search on CleanMyMac X, and it only flagged up an issue with Safari. (Dealt with.)\nIs there anything I can do to prevent these false positive warnings happening save waiting for Apple to push updates?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this appears to be an issue with HP printer drivers and/or Catalina 10.15.7 - I'm one of many people with the same issue. Lots of us are reporting the same symptoms on the HP Support forums, but at the time of writing there's no fix. Based on experiences so far, HP are ignoring the issue, hanging up on phone calls, or claiming that you'll need to buy a new printer.\nAll indications at the moment are that there's some kind of issue with the driver signing. Using AirPrint may be a workaround.\nI'll update this answer if anything substantial changes.\nUPDATE: The issue has now been resolved. We can assume that Apple and/or HP has reinstated the code signing certificate, or added the signature to a whitelist, or some other behind-the-scenes magic. No user intervention was required for me - no reinstallation of drivers or anything else, the printer that was failing to start a few days ago now works without any problems.\n\nA: Download new driver from hp support website can solve this problem.\neg: https://support.hp.com/cn-zh/drivers/selfservice/closure/hp-laserjet-pro-p1106-p1108-printer-series/5099191?ssfFlag=true&sku=\n\nA: The HP certificates were revoked due to security breaches and it is not clear if Mac software is vulnerable or just that HP chose to revoke certificates used in both the vulnerable software and Mac software that was not compromised by these specific vulnerabilities.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hp-device-manager-backdoor-lets-attackers-take-over-windows-systems/\n\n*https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06921908\nThe wording of Apple’s pop up did surprise many people, but these CVE are super severe so I don’t disagree with the decision to shut off / revoke all their certificates implicated in known problems and repackage the software they know is safe. It appears this all happened in less than 12 hours on a Friday.\nWe pushed this HP installer to thousands of Macs middle of the day yesterday and t restored all printing before Apple had the updates which we are applying as well to all computers.\n\n*\n\n*https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software12/HP_Quick_Start/osx/Installations/Essentials/hp-printer-essentials-S-5_14_8_4.pkg\n\nA: HP have released a notice about how to fix this issue: reinstall the affected drivers via HP Easy Start, Apple Software Update or downloading drivers from HP’s website.\nI tried the second. I got an error saying the driver is damaged and can’t be installed. But the driver download from HP at https://support.hp.com/gb-en/drivers worked.\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2020/10/26/what-happened-with-security-updates-and-hp-printer-software/\n\nA: This quick recipe worked for me. I deleted the offending file by entering this in my Terminal:\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Printers/hp/laserjet/p1100_1560_1600series/hpRaster.bundle\n\nThen, when I next tried to print a page, a message came up with a \"need to install printer driver\" message with a \"click here to install\" link. I clicked that thing and all is now well.\n\nA: By the time I read this page, I had already tried Apple Software Update (multiple times) so I tried HP Easy Start.  The bad news is that I'm still seeing a diagnostic about Matterhorn.framework, whatever that is.  The good news is that printing proceeds (I reach the summit (heh)) after closing the malware notification.  Closing the earlier malware notifications shutdown printing.\n", "Q: Change highlight color for deadkey previews (like accents: `´^¨) in terminal app I've been tweaking the theme / color preferences in the Terminal.app a bit, after a while I found that when pressing a diacritical mark/accent/dead key there's a highlighted yellow rectangle showing a preview of the accent you're inputting.

I often want to use these on non-active windows and of course they're not visible until you hover over them or activate the window, which prevents instant tracking of their location. I don't think they would be distracting if they were visible on all windows, and I have a feeling there is some tweak somewhere that would disable the auto-hide feature. Has anyone ever done this?\n\n\nA: No, what you're asking for is not possible.  There's no \"tweak\" to remove the \"auto hide feature\" because it's not a feature; it's a design element of macOS.\nApple provides very specific guidance when working with the Title Bar within the Frame in their guidelines in Window Anatomy of their Human Interface Guidelines for macOS:\n\n\nThis is how users interact with the system and specifically, this is how they know what window is active or not.  Apple goes out of their way to document how users should interact with every element; their not going to supply a way to circumvent it.  For context, this can't be done in any OS GUI that I can think of ranging from Windows to GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.  There's no reason for Apple to deviate from this standard.\n", "Q: How to create \"Drag to Applications Folder\" in dmg?

I'm wondering if you can help me by telling me if there is a way to put in some terminal code to delete the downloads folder ? I never use it and apparently you can't just delete it.\n\nA: First of all, you need to change the default location for downloads to your Desktop folder, if that's what you want.\nIn Safari > Preferences > General, there's a setting for the downloads location. This sets the preference for all applications, not just Safari.\nIf you don't do this, then any app that wants to save a file there will likely recreate the folder in the process of saving.\nAs of Catalina, the Downloads folder has a com.apple.macl extended attribute, which is protected by SIP.

When I look up google, I get an IPv6 address and not an IPv4 address \nThis is giving me issues in Wireshark with the source since I can’t manage to map the different addresses for the same name.\n\n\nCan I force lookups to be IPv4 or do I have to handle more than one type of address to use wireshark?\n\nA: What you are seeing is IPv6 dns servers that your Mac is getting from your router. Note that IPv6 dns can still return IPv4 addresses so you will need to handle both sets of addresses since some servers and networks are now IPv6 only.\nIPv6 is a replacement for the older and more common IPv4 that you are used to seeing. Why? Because the world is literally running out of IPv4 IP addresses and the new IPv6 is an enormously larger address space (3.4×10^38 addresses).\nThere is nothing wrong with your Mac. You should leave it alone. Changing that to an IPv4 address, while possible, does nothing for you. And, in fact, it would be like someone deciding to go back to horse and buggy transportation instead of his car because he thinks horses are prettier. Certainly your call and certainly possible but not necessarily the most efficient use of your time and effort.\nThe conversion from IPv4 to IPv6 is taking longer than many people expected but it is happening and eventually the old IPv4 addresses will not be used. My advice to you, \"get used to the new standard.\"\nFor some time, you might try disabling IPv6 entirely or force your Mac to use openly IPv4 based DNS services, but you will break things and be limited even today on what you can do by excluding the possibility of interacting with IPv6 networks.\n\nA: The previous answers are correct when they say nothing is wrong with using ipv6. If you are trying to learn or simplify things you can disable ipv6 in your network settings (which may affect connecting to your router depending on your isp.) to do this go to your network settings and change ipv6 from automatic.\n\nAlso,.. Wireshark allows you to choose an interface (WiFi and/Ethernet ect) to display the traffic from. That won’t be changing.. what you can do is customize the columns being displayed to only show ipv4 (resolved or unresolved) I.e. www.google.com or 8.8.8.8... you would want to remove the ipv6 columns to avoid confusion. You can also define a single or range of IP addresses to display a customized name within wireshark.

I can not find /tmp/debuglog.txt anywhere though.\n\nA: Perhaps that message is from a time where the temporary directory was indeed /tmp many macOS versions ago. Nowadays macOS manages a private temporary directory per GUI user which is provided as the environment variable $TMPDIR somewhere in /var/folders — try open $TMPDIR/debuglog.txt.\n\nA: According to the wiki at\nhttps://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/wikis/DebugLogging\nIf you go to menu at top and select Iterm2>Toggle Debugging,\nit will start the debugging session, if you click it again,\nit will turn off debugging, and then the file will be written\nto /tmp/debuglog.txt.\nI just tried it and it works for me\n\nA: One possible reason for not finding the debug log is that iTerm does not have full disk access. It asks once when first installed, but if you skip giving it the permission, many things still work but it is unable to write to /tmp. Go to System Settings, Privacy & Security, Full Disk Access, and make sure iTerm's access is enabled.

Thanks.\n\nA: Yes, you will be wasting energy and cooling and no the hardware won’t suffer (especially if you let the backlight go off).\nPower cycles cause our Macs to fail three to five years before those we leave on all the time. The longest running Macs we have are the ones that run always.\nWe happily replace batteries and drives when they fail, but the stats are clear for us that if you can leave the gear running, you generally have the longest life. We don’t have as many iMacs as mini and pro and even laptops in rooms due to space, but I see no reason why their engineering would be any different than the rest.\nThis pattern followed from the Motorola to PPC to Intel transitions and I can’t wait to see how Apple Silicon changes the hardware and what doesn’t change.\n", "Q: How can I boot in single-user mode for terminal with grey screen?

I noticed youtube videos take time to load on XR compared to 6s!\nIs this normal or shall I get it checked out?\n\nA: Typically the Wi-Fi antenna is kept close to the outer shell of the phone, so overall thickness shouldn't matter. This may be due to your wireless router being an older model and using an older standard than the XR was designed for (Wireless G/N, for example).

Is this piece important?\nThank you in advance for any replies to my query!\n\nA: It is a structural connector and should be repaired and replaced. The battery is part of what makes the case stiff so your device will be more susceptible to bends. Not having the bottom cover latch in could damage the batteries in a very unsafe way. Same if that piece or even a tiny screw were wedged between any part of the top case or bottom cover and the battery thereby pinching or puncturing the exposed cells.\nRather than risk a fire, I would have someone trained on Mac repairs examine your Mac and evaluate of it’s safe due to any chance a piece of plastic or screw was loose inside. The linked article you mentioned has a much less fragile battery and isn’t as susceptible to torsion due to a fundamentally different case structure design. Your battery has less armor than the older ones and safety depends entirely on zero loose parts being inside the case.\nA proper fit of the bottom plate for ensured protection and structural integrity.

Recently, I poured water onto the keyboard of my MacBook 2017 (4 thunderbolt), and I forced shutdown it. After letting it dry for two weeks, I opened it and everything seems to work. It also passes the Apple Hardware Test.\nHowever, login (login window, switching user, authenticating for root permission, terminal login) is extremely slow, taking around 20 to 40 seconds. After restarting a couple of times, the behavior does not change. After reinstalling macOS 10.13.6, High Sierra, (keeping application and data), the behavior persists. After starting up in Safe Mode and restarting, the time shortened a little bit.\nTo verify that this is not a hardware problem, I copied the system partition to another MacBook Pro (same generation) and I can see the same behavior, suggesting that this is a software issue.\nUpdate: On the other MacBook Pro, I run chflags -R noschg,nosappnd,nouchg,nouappnd / and boot up the machine in Safe Mode (and rebooted). The issue was gone, but only for Safe Mode. Starting again in normal boot recreates the problem, and further Safe Mode cannot correct it.\nThings I have tried on my other MacBook Pro that does not work:\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall macOS High Sierra\n\n*Removing caches and user added filesystems/extensions/launchdaemons/launchagents\n\n*Upgrade to Mojave (login for login window is extremely fast, but terminal login is still slow. Plus it deletes all the files I have in root account (downloads, desktop, documents, etc.)\n\n*Partial copy done by Carbon Copy Cloner from my mac because it disconnected after a certain while in Target Disk Mode. System work and login is fast. But for some reason I forget I erased the system and did a full copy again.\n\n*Repaired home permissions using diskutil resetUserPermissions / 501 then 502, 503, etc.\n\n*Repaired disk permissions using https://www.firewolf.science/2016/07/repairpermissions-v3-now-supports-repairing-permissions-on-macos-mojave/\nThe output of dtruss login root is here.\nThe output of sample login as instructed here: here The main cause is semaphore_wait_trap, but I don't know how to debug it.\nHow can I troubleshoot this problem?\n\nA: I had the same problem everywhere authentication is needed after upgrading to High Sierra. Sampling login process gave similar output where ODRecordAuthenticationAllowed takes longer to complete than usual. The call graph shows that the authentication request dispatched from transaction_simple probably encountered some multithreading issue as caught by semaphore_wait_trap that consumed most of the runtime. So, something else must have been busy with authentication ALL the time. In my case the culprit turns out to be the printer. After updating the printer's driver and changing to use AirPrint from CUPS, login, terminal, browsing etc. are now all working to normal, and sampling login process again produces nothing as now the authentication request is too fast to catch.\n", "Q: MBP 2017 making high pitched noise when in Target Disk Mode Recently, when I was transferring data between two MBPs, I found that the 15-inch 4 Thunderbolt MBP 2017 was making a high-pitched noise when in Target Disk Mode and connected to another mMc. It doesn't matter whether the MBP was charging or not. It doesn't matter when I connect; as soon as I do, it starts making high-pitched noise. What is a possible explanation for this? The MBP does not make high-pitched noise when in Target Disk Mode but not connected to another mac, when booted up into recovery system, when booted up into 10.13, or when booted up into 10.15.\n\nA: There are many reasons for high pitched noises (commonly referred to as electrical squeal).  However, without hearing it and being able to put hands on, it's impossible to diagnose.\n\n*\n\n*Try a higher quality Thunderbolt 3 cable.  An active cable which will handle higher bandwidth and more power is a good bet.\n\n*Determine if it's coming from the speakers by manipulating the volume.  If it is, some part of the audio circuitry is picking up noise and amplifying it.  This is a logic board issue.\n\n*It could be a shielding issue - as silly as it sounds, you might be able to solve this by wrapping the cable in aluminum foil.\n\nThe OS and TDM mode aren't going have any effect on electrical noises; these are created when electrons move through a conductor and they can sometimes produce a squeal or a whine. However, the bottom line is that your Mac is not supposed to be doing that.  If it is, there's likely a failed component and it must be taken in for service.\n", "Q: Homebrew - How to upgrade a HEAD forumla?

Presumably, that would also run if you transferred device to device but for some reason Apple only mentions computer and iCloud setup in the support articles and when I talked with support and engineering about my issue before these articles were published.\nSo far, iCloud has bailed me out three times ( shelf and two friends) and we did make a computer backup, but didn’t try them first. I set up two fast Macs with content caching that saves/serves iCloud data so iCloud restored fly for me and happen faster than a new backup to the same computers over USB. I could see the opposite direction  wing much faster for other setups, so my solution might not be optimal for all, but it works well for me.\nI would not rely on direct migration to fix this and would do what Apple says, on the original device if possible and work with Apple support if you fail to fix it after one go.\n", "Q: How to enable an unsupported HP Thunderbolt dock on macOS Catalina I have an HP Elite Thunderbolt 3 dock, and it will only charge my Mac. Any monitor or other external device it won't recognize.\nI found an article by 9to5mac but tried it without success on macOS Catalina. I also tried this solution without success as well.\nDoes anyone know of any resource how to let macOS use docks which it lists as unsupported?\n\nA: \nHow to enable an unsupported HP Thunderbolt dock on macOS Catalina\n\nYour question answers itself - it's not supported.\nThere's a huge misconception regarding the compatibility of devices being connected to a host computer; it's not limited to Apple, this is applicable across the entire industry.\nJust because a device is identified by the operating system, doesn't mean it's going to work with said operating system.\nFor whatever reason, Apple has decided that this particular dock is not compatible.  It's a pretty safe bet that Apple isn't trying to prevent HP from encroaching on Apple's lucrative Thunderbolt 3 Dock business as Apple doesn't have one.\nIt's all about the sub-components\nJust because a device utilizes a particular technology (Thunderbolt, USB, PCIe, etc.) doesn't mean that it will be compatible with your operating system.  That dock is much more than a \"USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 Dock.\"  There's a video chip, a USB controller, audio (in and out), and even a network chip.  To make all those components talk to the PCIe bus (part of Thunderbolt), you need a bridge (it's another chip).  Any or all of these could be incompatible.\nThunderbolt (USB, PCIe, etc.) is merely the medium that connects peripheral devices to the host; you can think of it as the \"road.\"  While a large 18 wheeler (lorry for our UK friends) works on the road it doesn't mean you're able to park it outside your house.  In other words, it's not compatible.\nManufacturer Blocks\nManufacturers put in these \"blocks\" to prevent you from using something because it's not supported.  It could simply not work or it could crash or even damage your system.\nRemember, there are multiple sub-components on that dock and Apple doesn't include drivers for every single device on the market.  They include only what's necessary for their hardware.  Bypassing the block doesn't magically make these components compatible with each other.  Using the road analogy from earlier, you could pave a bypass around the imposed roadblock but, in the end, you still can't park that truck in your driveway.\nBut, it Charges!\nYes.  This is expected behavior.  Charging is a function that happens outside the scope of the OS.  You can charge your Mac when turned off and even if the drive has been wiped.  Your Mac and the dock are both USB-PD (Power Delivery) compliant meaning they both use the industry standard method to deliver power for charging.  Since it's outside the OS, there's nothing to block nor is there the ability to.\nIs the Macbook 12 inch's USB-C charger interchangeable with other USB-C chargers or devices?\nTL;DR\nBypassing the block isn't going to make it work.  There are sub-components to that dock like video, network, and audio that also must be compatible with macOS.  If it was blocked by Apple or HP, it was done so for a reason - most likely there is incompatible or conflicting hardware present\n\nA: Super smug answer, I'll add some less smug information - I have both HP Elite and G2 120W TB3 docks which worked 90% perfectly in 10.15 (with the unsupported patch installed) - sound, USB3.0, thunderbolt passthrough/USB-C video, networking and charging. The only thing that didn't work was the Displayport based outputs (and VGA I assume but I never tested that). They're all based off pretty standard chipsets and don\nt need any drivers is MacOS.\nSo yes everything you say is correct but if you jump across to Bootcamp it all works so its all in Apples court really.\nThe unfortunate current situation is that from what I can tell there is no patches available for Big Sur to enable Thunderbolt so on my Elite I only have USB-C pass through video (quite happily doing 4KP60) and charging.\nLets hope something comes out in the future as there are lots of the HP docks turning up on eBay that are exlease and never used.\n", "Q: Is JXA still supported?

It's also present in Big Sur.  More importantly, there's been no indication or statement regarding it being deprecated † or removed as a feature from Apple.\nDoes it have a future in macOS?\nIn all practicality, only Apple can answer this. However, IMHO, it's likely to continue for a long time.  JavaScript is a very popular and widespread language meaning there's lots of resources available.  According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for 2020, it was the top in programming, scripting and markdown languages (eighth year in a row).  It would be short sighted to kill it from AppleScript.\n\nRegarding the documentation, (again, IMHO), there's no need to update it.  What was linked there was an intro and nothing has changed since it's introduction.  Anything related to JavaScript is already well taken care of with the countless resources available.\n\n† There's a distinction between being deprecated and dead.

This will work will all Mac laptops.\nUse External Speakers\nA better option, IMO, is to use quality external speakers.  There's a limit to how \"good\" internal speakers sound and a speaker no more than 2 inches (5cm) in diameter driven at a few measly watts isn't going to give you quality sound.

According to some posts in Canon's forum, the PIXMA MP560 printer/scanner isn't supported on Mac OS Catalina. But it hasn't been officially supported since 10.11, and it still works on 10.14.6.\nAnyone have experience trying it on Catalina? Does it work with Apple's built-in drivers?\n\nA: There's been a lot of question regarding these Canon Pixma MFPs of late.  The driver was probably a 32 bit driver which is why it worked up to 10.14.x (Mojave).  Typically, printer drivers will work with newer versions of an OS if the print system hasn't changed significantly.\nFrom a Windows side of things, we had Windows XP printer drivers in Windows 7/8 machines without issue.  Likewise, we had Windows 7 drivers that worked flawlessly in Windows 10.  And here on the Mac side of things, there are lots of discontinued printers that has compatible drivers (I have an HP CP2025dn that works flawlessly).\nUnfortunately, these consumer based MFPs can be difficult to support.  On the OpenPrinting site  this particular printer is listed as a \"Paperweight.\"  This means that there's not even a generic driver that you can get that will support it.\nHowever, what you can do is if you can get it working on an older Mac or a Raspberry Pi running Linux where it is supported, you can share it over the network and print to that print server and let it render the job instead of connecting directly.\n", "Q: How to turn off horizontal split screen on iOS 14 on an iPhone?

(Which gesture even causes the split? I seem to be able to do the split only randomly.)\nA quick google search only yields iPad tutorials** - the screen settings differ on an iPhone.\n\n\nA: This is called Reachability. It is activated by swiping down on the bottom edge of the screen. To get out of this view, you can swipe back up anywhere on the screen or click the up arrow at the top.\nThis is useful when you’re using your phone with one hand and can’t easily access the top of the screen.\nIt can be disabled in Accessibility settings, under “Touch”.\n\nNote that devices which have a home button can activate Reachability by double tapping the home button, and can exit by tapping the home button again.\n\nA: Unlike iPadOS (variant of iOS, renamed to reflect features specific to iPad, such as the ability to view multiple running apps at once), iOS has no ability to view two or more running apps in a split screen mode.\nWhat you are encountering is an iOS (running on iPhone) feature called Reachability. Reachability is a feature available on iPhones with an iPhone 6–sized screen or larger. The rationale is to make single-handed use of larger screens easier by temporarily shifting the on screen elements to make them easily accessible.\nYou can learn more about Reachability in the official iPhone user guide.\nReachability is enabled by default in iOS.

It's a value that, for a lack of a better term, is \"calculated\".  The SMC reads certain values, measures the current charge and depending on the results, you get a \"status.\"\nThis is why you can have a faulty battery one minute, change it out with a good and it in a few moments, it will give you an updated status of \"Charging\" or \"Charged.\" (Granted, it takes more than a \"minute\" to swap a battery, but you get the idea).\nYou can obtain this information with the system_profiler command:\n% system_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep -i \"charge information\" -A 10\n\n\nA: The OS reads the SMC and caches  the results.

I use a shared MacBook Pro with Catalina; I've done some basic research into deleting files but worry deleting too often will shorten the life of the drive (this is for a machine bought in April 2020).\nIn general, how easy is it to recover a file from an SSD as compared to a HDD, especially if you want to ensure something is permanently deleted with little chance of recovery (more sensitive files like medical etc. that you've copied elsewhere).\nI've only ever used Mac minis as Mac computers before now so aren't quite familiar with this.\nI did try Edenwaith's Permanent Eraser but is this overkill?\nIf anyone can guide me on this I'd appreciate it.\n\nA: You don't need to worry about either the security of the deleted file(s) nor the life of the SSD.\n\nIn general, how easy is it to recover a file from an SSD as compared to a HDD,\n\nIt's virtually impossible.\nWhen you \"delete\" a file on an SSD, it tags the blocks as unused and depending on the scheme that it uses (DRAT or RZAT) when the block is subsequently read, it will either return zeros or it will return random data (garbage).  Tagging it as \"unused\" means the drive will recycle it for the next set of writes rather than writing over it to erase and then writing again with actual data.\n\n*\n\n*Can the data on an MacBook Pro SSD be recovered after formatting using Disk Utility\n\n*How to get the \"securely erase\" function of Disk Utility on El Capitan & Sierra\nIn the second linked post, it talks about how the command srm (secure delete) is no longer available in macOS.  It's because it's no longer necessary.  It's virtually impossible to retrieve data once it's deleted from an SSD and if you enable encryption (File Vault), it's gone forever.\nUnlike a traditional HDD, when you delete a file, it doesn't overwrite the file either.  Instead, it deletes the pointer to the file.  Since the data wasn't overwritten, it was easy to recover.\nYou will outlive your SSD\nThe short answer here is that you simply cannot write enough data in your lifetime to worry about wearing out an SSD.  You are more likely to outstrip it's capacity or for it to fail due to a component failure before it wears out.\nLimited Read and Writes on MacBook Air SSD\nUsing Intel's SSD life span calculator as a basis for the calculation, you'd have to take and save 24,0000 digital images per day for the rest of your life to wear out an SSD.\nTL;DR\n\n*\n\n*You don't overwrite data when you delete on an SSD so wear isn't a concern.\n\n*Retrieving the data from a deleted block on an SSD is next to impossible because of the way data is retrieved\n\n*You can't write enough data to  your SSD that wear would become an actual issue to deal with.\n\n\nA: Deleting will add extra writes to a SSD. However, unless you plan on doing many GB per day the overall impact should not be noticeable.\nRecovery is harder than a classic hard drive. A SSD has hidden storage that it uses for wear levelling and covering any worn out parts of the visible SSD storage. A SSD internally is jumbled up as it tries to prevent any constantly overwriting file from burning a hole in the drive by spreading writes around. It only pretends to look organized. You can try to erase but you cannot easily guarantee a full overwrite. Perhaps there are SSD specific erasing apps.\nSince the extra storage cannot be easily accessed (and a SSD will reshuffle the drive to evenly spread out the wear and tear) you should consider full drive encryption. This makes all the storage always scrambled if you are not logged in.\n", "Q: Can I use two USB-C to HDMI/DVI cables to hook up to two monitors from my MacBook Pro (2017)?

This is exactly how you would do it.\nI would avoid using HDMI on your first monitor and instead opt for a pure DisplayPort to DisplayPort connection (the Thunderbolt ports natively output a DP signal). But if you must, use an active adapter for best results.   As for the monitor that uses the DVI port, a simple converter should do, depending on the monitor.  Depending on the resolution that monitor is capable of, you may need a dual link DVI adapter.

Today I took it out and tried to plug in my headphones into the headphone jack but they would not go in. There appears to be nothing stuck in them and I have tried to use a toothpick to try and take dust/dirt out but that didn't work. I've also tried shoving the wire in with force but that did not work either. If anyone has any other ideas they would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: If your headphone jack cannot go in, there are only three reasons why this will occur:\n\n*\n\n*The port is obstructed\n\n*The headphone jack is the wrong size\n\n*There's a manufacturing defect of the MacBook port\n\nYou can't remove dust or dirt if there's no dust or dirt to remove.  Also, you don't want to use a tooth pick as that will push objects in further and can even damage the port.  Compressed air is a better option and if you can do it from the back of the connector (requires opening the case), that would be the most effective method.\nForcing a connector is highly discouraged; if you can't make the connection with the reasonable amount of force that's required, stressing it could break things.  If it doesn't go in, something is wrong and excessive force will make it worse.\nVerify that the headphone jack can be inserted into other devices and that you are indeed using a 3.5mm jack.  Finaly, try other headphones.  If  none can fit, then it's very likely you have a Mac with a manufacturing defect.  If that's the case, try contacting Apple Support. You may have some luck with them swapping out the case even if you're outside the warranty period.\n\nA: Your MBA is still under warranty. Either have the store you purchased it from or Apple themselves address the situation.

I've read a few different sites (including this one), but I am just struggling to parse the information into something that has proven useful to me.\nI downloaded the latest ISO from the Windows 10 site (October 2020 update).  I went through the Bootcamp Assistant prompts - mounting the ISO to a 32GB flash drive, downloading the Bootcamp drivers, and creating the partition (200GB).\nThe MBP critical information is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Mojave 10.14.6\n\n*1TB SSD\n\n*DVD Drive recently not operating correctly (still need to\ntroubleshoot)\n\n*No USB devices plugged in besides flash drive with mounted ISO\n\nWhen I reboot after Bootcamp Assistant is complete, I hold down ALT and am shown three options: my OS X partition, my USB drive, and EFI Boot.  I select EFI Boot.\nI then go through the motions, entering my product key etc, after which I am confronted with a screen with the partition selections.  Of course, I cannot choose the option OS X has created for Bootcamp because of it being recognized as MBR instead of GPT.  I used GPT fdisk (had some trouble with rootless system but was able to get past that by disabling in recovery environment) and received the following message:\nWarning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their\npartition table automatically reloaded!\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.\n\nThis indicates there is nothing wrong and it is indeed a pure GPT partition table, no?  Either way, I thought so, so I went back into OS X and deleted the Bootcamp partition in Disk Utility and manually re-created another partition to use.  I got my inspiration from this article and was able to get back to Windows Setup within EFI Boot, delete the partition within that environment which I had created manually earlier, and then create a new partition with the newly unallocated space.\nAfter this, it begins the process of installing Windows.  Unfortunately, the joy does not last long because I end up with a BSOD, followed by multiple reboots where I have the option to try to \"recover.\"  This results in more BSOD's and a loop of involuntary reboots until I hold down ALT and tell the computer to go back to OS X (with my head hanging in shame).\nI'm at a loss as to what to do next here.  Right now I am downloading an older version of Windows 10 in the background to see if perhaps it's an issue related to that.  This guy seems to believe an older version of Windows is necessary in order to have success.  We'll see.\nAs others have noted, it's not possible to boot from the USB directly as the laptop simply comes up with a black screen indicating there's \"no bootable device, press any key, etc.\"  This would certainly be the preferred method if it were possible.  Any help is appreciated!\nEDIT:  Here is a post outlining the exact place I am at.  The thread indicates USB3.0 drivers are the issue now.  I'm prepared to start over and track down the necessary drivers to add to the appropriate folder in my flash drive, but I'm now starting to wonder if there's any other steps I need to be aware of before I run into potentially the next road block.\n\nA: I would seem to me that you are missing the obvious. If the Boot Camp Assistant configured your Mac to install Windows 10 to BIOS boot, then you should have not tried so hard to defeat this. Install Windows 10 to BIOS boot and if this works, then accept that your model is one of the last built before Apple converted over to UEFI booting Windows 10. From my understanding, the industry switched to UEFI booting Windows in 2011. Apple, which usually is forward thinking in technology, eventually lagged behind and did not convert until sometime in 2012 or perhaps 2013.\nI do not understand how the Windows installer detected hybrid partitioning while gdisk did not. You may not have applied gdisk to the correct drive. Using the Disk Utility or diskutil command to remove and recreate the Windows partition would under Mojave eliminate any hybrid partitioning. This would then allow you to attempt to install an UEFI booting Windows 10. However, if Apple indented for you to install Windows to BIOS boot, then the Boot Camp drivers may only be designed for BIOS booting. This may account for your BSOD issues.\nThere was a previous version of Windows which caused the BSOD to occur due to the version of Boot Camp that was installed. This problem could be resolved by manually upgrading BootCamp or by installed an older release of Windows. Although you did not specify if your BSOD problem occurred before or after installing Boot Camp. Also, there does appear to be previous versions of the Windows Support Software for your Mac which can be downloaded.\nInstalling Windows 10 by BIOS Booting the Installer from an Internal Drive\n\n*\n\n*Here, I assume the internal drive is hybrid partitioned.

It comes with the Mac OS X Lion but nobody seems to know its password because it's a rather dated company asset. I tried to wipe it and reinstall the OS via internet recovery, but it requires the original Apple ID by which this MacBook Pro was purchased which I don't have either. I said so because I tried my own Apple ID and it only told me something like service not available/cannot connect to the server while the internet was perfectly fine.\nSo I downloaded the installer of Mac OS and extracted the InstallESD.dmg, then used it to restore the OS partition after erasing the whole OS partition. However, it seems the installed OS can't boot, as the start disk is not chosen. But in the start disk list, I can only see either a network server of our company, or the Flash drive I used to restore the dmg file. Is there any way I can resolve the matter please?\n\nA: Any Apple account that purchased the OS should work, but be sure you enter your password plus pin tacked on the end. The installer wasn’t prepared for MFA or TFA so this is a bit of an edge case.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915\nSearch to the bottom for the part\n\nThen type your password followed by the six-digit verification code directly into the password field.\n\nBut you don’t really state what you want to do, we don’t know your exact model and if you can just connect this to another Mac in target disk mode and run the installer on a new Mac to install to the old one. Hopefully you can go back to recovery and get the normal install path to work from recovery still.\nI’ve had good luck installing the OS I want to an external drive and holding option to boot as well if you don’t want to install direct over target disk mode.\n", "Q: macOS: Disconnect Wi-Fi without turning it off How can I disconnect from Wi-Fi on Mac without turning it off?

I have here a very strange case...\nI have a MacBook Pro 13\" (A1278) from 2010. Inside it is a 1TB FireCuda SSHD (ST1000LX015) hybrid hard drive.\nThe MacBook was working perfectly until a recent system update.\nSuddenly, the hard drive became totally undetected when within the MacBook: the system cannot boot and the hard drive is totally unvisible; it does not show when holding down the Alt key at start (just after powering the MacBook on).\nHowever:\n\n*\n\n*The hard drive is physically in perfect condition, with all SMART values checked OK.\n\n\n*The volume is in perfect condition. (checked with OS X disk utility)\n\n\n*The partition table is in perfect condition (checked with the disk utility from another MacBook, with the drive in an external enclosure)\n\n\n*The system loads perfectly if the hard drive is put in an external enclosure and the MacBook booted from there.\nSo, I first suspected the SATA cable (altough looked in perfect condition), but:\n\n*\n\n*Some hard drives with the Apple logo are detected.\n\n\n*Other hard drives from all brands (Seagate, Western Digital, Toshiba, Hitachi), but with non-Apple firmware, are not detected.\nBy \"not detected\" I mean that the drive is not listed when holding down the Alt button at start.\nI tried several times to make sure that the problem was not coming from the cable.\nThe Apple Store told the problem was coming from the hard drive, but it is wrong as thus is in perfect condition.\nConclusion:\n\n*\n\n*I suspect some white list of hard drives was introduced at BIOS level by some upgrade of the system, possibly to attract customers into Apple stores.\n\n\n*I don't know yet if there is a firmware white list or a hard drive model white list.\n\n\n*I would like to hear if some of you experience similar cases.\n\n\n*Apart from using Apple-branded hard drives, any solution to solve this issue is welcome.\nNote: holding down Cmd + Alt + P + R did not solve anything.\n\nA: *\n\n*The problem was coming from the SATA cable. Replacing it solved the\nproblem.\n\n*The failure was difficult to diagnose because intermittent.\n\n*Beware of the cable length. One MacBook Pro A1278 from other year could provide a similar compatible cable, but the cable length was different: ok for testing purposes, but not for a replacement.\n\n*According to other posts, MacBook Pro from 2012 experience similar failures.\n\n\nA: No, there is no white list of acceptable replacements for storage disks held in firmware.\nApple doesn't make their own drives. Hard drives are made for Apple by Toshiba and Seagate, and the supplied drives are not 'custom built': they just meet a certain spec.\nI've replaced the hard drive on hundreds of Macs and never had a problem of this sort.\nYou say that the SATA cable \"looked in perfect condition\" and you \"tried to make sure that the problem was not the cable\". You can't tell by looking at it if the cable is faulty. What did you do to test the cable?\nI would definitely try replacing the SATA cable, as they are a well-known point of failure on those models. The fact that the drive works externally but not internally would suggest that.\n(Though to be honest, I would recommend getting a 1TB SSD, as this would significantly improve your Mac's speed.)\n", "Q: Is it possible to export configuration from Apple's macOS Stocks app?

If I set my sound effects to come out \"Selected sound output device\" via the sound Preference panel while using my bluetooth headphones, everything works as expected - both regular sound (like music or video sounds) and sound effects (like sent mail \"swoosh\" effects) come out my headphones.  If I then go up to the volume control icon on the top right of the toolbar, and set the Output Device to Internal Speakers, then all the sounds come out of my laptop's speakers.  But then if I set the Output Device back to my bluetooth headphones, then it also \"magically\" resets my \"Play sound effects through:\" setting back to \"Internal Speakers\" - so that now Music and Video sounds come out of my headphones, but sound effects come out of the laptop speakers themselves.  This seems broken - changing my output device shouldn't change other settings.  Does this do this for other people?  Is there something strange I'm doing to cause this odd side effect?\nUpdate (due to some confusion highlighted by the first attempted answer) - I did not disconnect my headphones during this experiment - I just toggled the Output Device from Headphones to Internal Speakers and back to Headphones.  I would assume that most people would want their \"Play sound effects through\" setting to be \"Selected sound output device\" all the time - since you'd want those sounds to come out of the same place sounds from the Music, TV or other audio/video apps to come from.  It was disconcerting to me the first time I was listening to music through my headphones and heard my laptop make noises (e.g. the mail sent \"swoosh\" sound).  So while I can imagine someone wanting to manually decouple the sound effects device from the general sound device, I would be highly surprised that people would want it to be automatically decoupled every time they put headphones in or out.\n\nA: This is how it’s supposed to work because when you disconnect a Bluetooth sound device, it no longer exists. When that happens everything goes back to the default of Internal Speakers\nI just tried it. I had everything set to my headset and when I disconnected it, it no longer showed up as an output device.\nThere are some apps that remember by output settings so if and when I reconnect my headset it will automatically switch.  It seems that the safety setting is to make sure Notifications always plays and that’s done by the system always setting them back to Internal.\nI also checked with my USB speakers by making sound effects go there and as long as those speakers were there even if Bluetooth was connected and disconnected, the notifications didn’t change to Internal.\n", "Q: How to disable tab preview on mouse hover in Safari for macOS? I have suddently started seeing webpage preview thumbnail in Safari. I have not enabled this option and I wish to turn off this behavior.\n\nHow can I turn it off?\n\nA: The tab preview that you are noticing is a newly introduced feature made available in recently released Safari 14. Safari 14 is going to be made available with the upcoming release of macOS 11 Big Sur and has also been made available via a software update for the users of macOS Catalina 10.15 and macOS Mojave 10.14.\nAs of this writing, there is no directly accessible option made available under either Safari Preferences or the Menu bar to turn off this feature. However, if you don't find the feature useful, there's a slightly involved workaround that could help you disable it.\nFollow the below mentioned steps one by one:\n\n*\n\n*Quit Safari.app.\n\n\n*Launch Terminal.app. You can find it by searching in Spotlight, within Utilities folder under Applications, or within Launchpad.\n\n\n*Copy paste the following line verbatim in Terminal and press the Enter key:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1\nThis would add a new menu item called Debug in the Safari menu alongside the Help menu item.\n\n\n*Now launch Safari.app and you'd notice the Debug menu item alongside the existing Help menu.\n\n\n*In the Debug menu, click to uncheck the Tab Features → Show Tab Preview on Hover (requires restart) option.\n\n\n\n*Now quit Safari.app by using the keyboard shortcut Command + Q.\n\n\n*Go back to Terminal.app and copy paste the following line verbatim and press the Enter key:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 0\nNotice that the last parameter to the command is now a 0 instead of 1.\n\n\n*You can close/quit Terminal.app after running the above command.\n\n\n*Now launch Safari.app and voila! the tab preview is gone. Also, you no longer see the Debug menu either (which is hidden by default).\n\nA: Update - new way for existing or clean-installed Big Sur installations:\nQuit Safari.\nUse Terminal to go to the correct preferences folder with this command:\nopen ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/\n\nOpen the com.apple.Safari.plist file.\nInsert the following lines (preferably directly above the IncludeDevelopMenu entry):\n<key>IncludeInternalDebugMenu</key>\n<true/>\n\nThe 'Debug' menu will now show in Safari.\nUse the \"Tab Features\" selection in the \"Debug\" menu to deselect the \"Show Tab Preview on Hover (requires restart)\" option.\nRestart Safari.\n", "Q: Black Screen when Upgrading RAM in 2019 iMac I bought the iMac with 8GB of RAM, 2x4GB SO-DIMMs.\nI wanted to upgrade to 128GB - 4 sticks of 32GB.

But, if I use all 4 at the same time, I have a black screen.\nAny tip please?\n\nA: The 2019 iMac computer have different memory specifications depending on which model you get - the 21\" and 27\"; the 4K or 5K models.  Not all models support 128GB of RAM.\nIt's also important to note that OWC is not the original memory.  OWC is an after market brand.  If you're positive all of your memory works, but when you install the rest you get a black screen, you may be trying to install too much.  Confirm you have the right memory for your particular application.\nThe 21\" models officially support up to 32GB of RAM and the 27\" models 64GB.  However, independent testing per EveryMac.com confirms that they can support 64GB and 128GB of RAM for the 21\" and 27\" models respectively.\n\n*\n\n*21: i3 4K iMac uses up to 64GB of PC4-19200 2400Mhz DDR4 RAM\n\n*21\" i5 & i7 4K iMac uses up to 64GB of PC4-21300 266MHz DDR4 RAM\n\n*27\" i5 & i9 5K iMac uses up to 128GB of PC4-21300 2666Mhz DDR4 RAM\nYou should be installing these in pairs, but there's no requirement to stagger the installation (slots 1 & 3 or 2 & 4).  See Install Memory in an iMac.  Memory is usually sold in \"kits.\"  A 32GB kit is two 16GB SO-DIMMs and a 64GB kit is two 32GB SO-DIMMs.  So, for example, for the 21\" iMac, you'll need two 32GB kits which will have four 16GB SO-DIMMS for a total of 64GB of RAM.\nHere's a breakdown of the maximum memory per slot for each model:\n\n*\n\n*21\" iMac → Max RAM per slot = 16GB\n\n*27\" iMac → Max RAM per slot = 32GB\n\n\nA: Check the serial number on the ram.

I must connect it to my WiFi network.\nI live in a large shared building of around 12 people, but we all use the same wifi network. A couple of times I've noticed random documents getting printed on my printer that clearly weren't my own.\nIs there a way I can set my printer so that it is connected to the network but so that only I can use it?\nCurrently I must unplug it, which isn't ideal. I even tried turning the printer off but I still found someone else's documents getting printed, it must have turned itself back on somehow.\nAlso, here are the settings I have under Sharing:\n\n\nA: As the existing answers have already mentioned - once connected to a network, any device on that network can print to it. It is not being controlled by your Mac's Sharing settings, it can be accessed directly by anyone on the network.\nIt appears from the manual that there are no additional security settings to define who may or may not use the printer. This is far more common in a business environment but your printer seems more oriented towards a consumer/family setup.\nI think, practically, the solution may be to set the printer up to use WiFi Direct rather than connect it to the existing communal WiFi. This would allow you to specify your own new, separate password, effectively preventing others from accessing it, accidentally or intentionally, without that password.\nOnce set up, disable the regular WiFi connection to remove it from the existing network.\nThe instructions for setting up WiFi Direct start on page 47 of the linked manual.\nYou could, of course, set it up over USB, then your Mac's Sharing settings would indeed come into play - the downside of this would be the Mac would need to be switched on & awake for you to be able to print from any other device; your phone, for instance.\n\nA: Your printer uses WiFi to connect to the local network. Any computer on the same network can then print to it directly, without 'going through' your Mac.\nEven if your printer is off, it's likely that someone else's computer will hold the print job in a queue until the printer becomes available.\nIf you want to prevent that, then you need to look through the printer's manual to see what security features it has. Either that, or turn off the WiFi feature and use a USB cable.\nUltimately, this isn't a Mac software question.\n\nA: The User Manual has no documentation on any security features for that printer.  So, regardless if it's WiFi or connected to Ethernet, it's a wide open printer on the network.  Business class printers will have the ability to lock out users through a variety of methods - I always recommend these printers over the consumer ones for this (and many other reasons)\nThe \"Printer Sharing\" section on your Mac, is for printers connected to your Mac. It allows you to manage who/what can print to that printer via your Mac.  Technically, you can share a networked printer, but as stated before, since that printer is \"wide open,\" anyone can get to it regardless of the policies you configure on your Mac.\nSo, you have two options:\n\n*\n\n*create your own small Wireless network that only you have access to and put your printer on that.\n\n*purchase a USB cable and connect your printer directly to your Mac.\n\n(Option 2 is probably the most effective method).\n\nA: Adding to Allans answer you could always try to \"create your own small Wireless network\" using your cellphones personal hotspot then you (and only you) should be able to print from your laptop or phone to your printer wirelessly.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2020 doesn't recognize second monitor while using usbc I want my MacBook pro-2020 to be closed and have one screen as the main screen(desktop) and the other screen as an extended one. I have 2 new Dell UltraSharp U2419HC monitors, and an UltraSharp U2419H (non-usbc).\nI have connected one screen to my MacBook using type c to type c cable (from screen to MacBook) and another display port cable from one screen to another one.\nIt looks like either my mac detects only one screen, or either I can't get an extended view over the 2 Dell screens.\nCurrently, the 2 Dell screens display the same thing, my Desktop. When I open my MacBook screen, it detects it's own screen and the Dell screen that is attached with the USB c on extended mode but doesn't detect the second Dell monitor.\nWhen I get into the System Pref -> Displays I can only see the Dell monitor that is connected with USB c.\nI have also tried to connect the USB c to a Dell laptop and it did work, so I assume it's not a connectivity issue, and furthermore when I'm connecting the second Dell screen using HDMI cable type c to my MacBook (overall 2 Dell monitors connected directly to my MacBook) it works.\n\nA: Daisy-chaining monitors over USB-C is not supported on macOS. This is due to the fact that macOS does not support MST for monitor daisy-chaining, unlike for example Microsoft Windows. You will need to use Thunderbolt monitors in order to get display daisy-chaining working.\nWith your current hardware, you need to connect each monitor to its own port on the MacBook Pro - or get a Thunderbolt 3 dock that allows you to connect two monitors to the dock, and then the dock via one cable to the MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Upgrade iOS 12 to iOS 13? Seemingly I cannot update using the older IPSW files, only iOS 14.\nI have an iPhone 7 test device with iOS 12, and I only want to update to iOS 13 (iOS 13.7).\nEvery attempt failed with basically the \"not authorized\" error. Tried with Finder, and iMazing.\nHow can I update to only iOS 13 (without jailbreaking)?\n\nA: Unfortunately you cannot. iOS 14 (specifically iOS 14.1) is the current latest version of iOS available and it supports running on iPhone 7.\nApple has stopped signing iOS 13 and it’s not possible to install it over the air or via IPSW file.\n", "Q: tmutil command to install a new larger Time Machine disk, copying old backups to it My old Time Machine backup drive (external USB) is now almost full. I have purchased a larger drive and want to switch to it for Time Machine, migrating all my old backups to the new drive's archive.\nI presume that I start by copying the Time Machine archive from the old backup drive to the new one. Then it seems I need to use tmutil associatedisk but the man terminology is rather confusing. Can someone give me the right parameters? Assume my system drive is called BootDrive, the old TM disk is OldTMDisk, and the new TM disk is NewTMDisk.\nThe iMac runs OS 10.13 (High Sierra).\n\nA: First, to migrate the data, the only thing you can use is Finder (in case you are copying using another method). No other application has been able to copy and preserve the folder hard links. Just drag the backups.backupdb folder from the old drive to the new drive.\nTo associate the disk with your mac, use tmutil setdestination /volumes/NewTMDisk and then tmutil inheritbackup /volumes/NewTMDisk/backups.backupdb/(your mac name). You shouldn't need to use tmutil associatedisk because you have not changed your internal hard disk.\n", "Q: Disable MacBook Pro discrete GPU for specific apps Is there a way to prevent certain apps from switching the active GPU to the discrete graphics card?\n\nI tried looking in System Preferences but there's only a setting to use the discrete GPU all the time.\nMacBook Pro: How to disable discrete GPU permanently from EFI? I read this question and its answers, but it's about disabling the discrete GPU permanently and not per app.\nI want GarageBand to stop using the discrete GPU on my MacBook Pro, to save battery life and reduce fan noise.\n\nA: I think the best answer is gSwitch.\nWhat you could do is use Automator to run the cli command of switch to discrete \"--discrete\" when GarangeBand is opened and switch to \"--dynamic\" or close the app when GarageBand is closed.\n", "Q: Can I set my Mac up to take a screenshot everytime I left click? I understand I am able to set my mac up to screenshot using timed intervals.

Periodically (daily), some of them will stop being responsive in Home and just say \"Not Responding\". This will happen on multiple iPhones in the house, not just mine. Typically it'll clear up later in the day several hours later.\nHowever, the devices are always just fine using either the vendor app on the same iPhone, or using the Home app on my Mac.\nI've tried killing the app to make it refresh, to no avail.\nAll devices have been upgraded to latest firmware. All iOS and macOS devices are on the latest OS releases.\nDevices are:\nYeelight bulbs\nWemo plugs\nVOCOlinc plugs\nWifi signal in the areas they're in is strong, and they're controllable just fine if I don't use the Home app, so it's not a signal issue either.\nAny other tips or tricks?\nIt's pretty irritating to have scenes only half work when a bunch of the devices just fail to respond.\n\nA: The solution is to get a device to act as a HomeKit Hub like a spare iPad, an AppleTV or a HomePod speaker†.\nI was experiencing this same issue until I got an AppleTV and used that as my Hub.  Once that device was on the network continually \"talking\" to the devices, they never \"stopped responding\" again.  I'm using more \"mainstream\" devices like Leviton, Lutron, GE, and Phillips.  I even had some of the newer brands like Weemo and Yeelight as you did, but found them even more flaky.  I have Ikea in the house, none of it has an electrical cord (there's only so much compromise I'm going to make and devices with 120V of mains current running through it isn't one of them).\nIt's not how strong or weak your WiFi is nor is how often you refresh your apps - it's how frequent (infrequent actually) it sends out traffic to update the Apps. If you're app on your phone misses it, it see's it as not responding.  I could usually fix it by issuing a command, having it fail, wait a couple minutes and the device would then become responsive. When I put the first AppleTV in, the issue completely went away.\nMy advice is two fold:\n\n*\n\n*Implement a Hub device\n\n*Stick to more conventional brands.\n\n\n† iPad 3rd Gen or later, iPad Air or later, iPad mini or later, AppleTV HD or 4K, or HomePod is required to act as a home hub.\n", "Q: PHP Version 7.3.22 to be removed in future macOS I just attempted to load a new development page without having created the httpdconf entry, & got the PHPinfo page with the following in the header...\nPHP Version 7.3.22-(to be removed in future macOS)\nDoes this mean Apple are intending to remove PHP from a future version of macOS? Or is it simply flagging that this version of PHP will be replaced?\n\nA: php -v gives the following response:\nWARNING: PHP is not recommended  \nPHP is included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software.  \nFuture versions of macOS will not include PHP.\n\nThe release notes for Catalina contain the following remark:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-catalina-10_15-release-notes\n\nScripting Language Runtimes\nDeprecations\nScripting language runtimes such as Python, Ruby, and Perl are included in macOS for\ncompatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS won’t\ninclude scripting language runtimes by default, and might require you\nto install additional packages. If your software depends on scripting\nlanguages, it’s recommended that you bundle the runtime within the\napp.\n\nIn short: macOS continues to include 'legacy' versions of things like Python, Ruby, Perl, and indeed PHP, so that existing code won't break, but Apple is leaving it to the user to install the versions that they want to use.\nAt the time of writing, 10.16 ('macOS 11') continues to include these languages.\n\nA: My understanding of “the plan” is for the OS to not come with PHP included. Apple did a similar transition - removing many open source tools and bundled code bases - from the Server.app\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208312\nMany of the server services went to the OS. Now the OS will be slimmed in the same manner. You will still be able to install PHP as you please / whichever version, but you’ll have to choose whether it comes from the App Store or another vector.\nHistorically, these take a year or three to implement, but there’s nothing stopping Apple from pulling PHP from 11.0.1 or any other mid-year point release.\n\nA: I got really surprised when I first saw this message on Terminal today, but to be honest, as I developer I don't like neither recommend using built-in scripting language like PHP, Ruby or even Apache, I always do and recommend if you need those tools so build and compile it yourself based on your needs, for an example I never use built-in PHP and Ruby because macOs always come with an outdated version of it.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade to an SSD with the newest macOS from an old HDD with old macOS on MacBook Pro 2012? As per the title, my MBP 2012's hdd with Mavericks installed had recently failed and I am looking to replace it with an SSD.\nI also have a MacBook Pro 2017 that I'm going to use to install macOS Catalina on the new SSD, so that I can directly use my MBP 2012 without having to wait for internet recovery.\nQuestion is, can the MBP 2012 recognize the Catalina-installed SSD, even if I assume the firmware is for the old Mavericks? Or do I have to go through internet recovery?\n\nA: Broadly speaking, any volume with MacOS on it should boot on any Mac that the OS supports.\nThere are some exceptions to that rule, of course. The newer T2-chip Macs complicate things with their SecureBoot settings. And some Macs require firmware updates on their internal drive before they can use APFS volumes -- though in your case the EFI partition will be created when you install the OS.\nSo it should work.\nThe better alternative would be to create an 'installer disk' on a small USB thumb drive, and boot to that, on the 2012 MBP, to install on the SSD once fitted internally.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201372\n", "Q: Different hibernate modes on MacBook Pro? Sorry if this question will appear to be stupid.\nIs it possible to set one hibernate mode (for example 3) when macbook is on power adapter and another hibernate mode (25) when it’s on battery. Is it absolutely nonsense or...? hehe\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Yes, you can set different hibernation modes with pmset.\nMost articles on the subject give the command pmset -a hibernatemode X (where X is a number). The -a flag is for 'all' modes: you can alternatively set -b for battery and -c for charger.\nWhether there's any benefit in doing so, is another matter! Modern RAM is quite efficient, and you're not likely to reap significant battery time savings: you'll just slow down the sleep and wake processes. The 25 setting was used in much older laptops.\n", "Q: Why I cannot extend value column for plist files? This is what I see and cannot extend the value column at all. Why is it so? Is it a bug or am I missing something?\n\n\nA: It's a bug. The Value column is meant to be the remaining width in the window.\nYou can fix it by dragging the right side of the window small enough to hide some of the Value column, then dragging the window bigger again. When you drag the window bigger this time, the right edge of the Value column will follow the side of the window.\n", "Q: zsh comment character Many bash scripts invoke the #character to indicate a comment.  Catalina migrated to zsh.  The command:\n# Comments should elicit no response\n\nreturns\n\nzsh: command not found: #\n\nI find useful command examples on the web: it is helpful  to annotate commands with said #weblink so that it is captured in the history.\nI did find this post: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11873793/4953146\n\n*\n\n*Is there a reason for the # not to be recognized as the comment character in zsh?\n\n*How can the terminal be configured to recognize the character as a comment?\n\nQuestion 1 sets the context for deciding on a method to address question 2.  It would nice to be able to configure the character once and all future instances of zsh would follow.  If there is / was a good reason why the feature was disabled, I would like to understand any reasons.\nUnderstanding the 'why' is important to determine the 'how'.  There seems to be many ways to restore # commenting in zsh.  One durable solution is to add to the configuration file: sudo vi /etc/zshrc:\nsetopt interactivecomments\n\nOther methods (not durable) include invoking ksh or sh.\nMany thanks to user3439894 & Allan for supporting / advancing the question.\n\nA: This is due to how Bash/Zsh is configured to handle comment characters in interactive and non-interactive shells.\nNormally, comment characters are not recognized in interactive shells by default, so this behavior is normal.\nFrom the Bash Reference Manual, Chapter 3.1.3 - Comments:\n\nIn a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the interactive_comments option to the shopt builtin is enabled , a word beginning with ‘#’ causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored. An interactive shell without the interactive_comments option enabled does not allow comments. The interactive_comments option is on by default in interactive shells.\n\nThe difference between interactive and non-interactive shells is that in the former, input and output is via the user's terminal whereas in the latter commands are asynchronous (no interaction).  Though you are in an interactive shell, when you start a script, a non-interactive subshell is created.\n\n*\n\n*Interactive Shells (Chapter 6.3)\n\n*Command Execution Environment (Chapter 3.7.3)\nThough I've referenced Bash in this answer, Zsh is the same.  Chapter 6.7 - Comments reads almost the same:\n\nIn non-interactive shells, or in interactive shells with the INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS option set, a word beginning with the third character of the histchars parameter (‘#’ by default) causes that word and all the following characters up to a newline to be ignored.\n\n\n\nIf there is / was a good reason why the feature was disabled, I would like to understand any reasons.\n\nI hesitate to use the word \"disabled\" as it's merely an environment variable that sets up the execution environment; it's simply \"not set\" by default.  There's no documentation as to the reasoning why Apple (ultimately) chose to set it.\nI can confirm that in other operating systems I've tested (FreeBSD and Debian), I installed Zsh (v5.8) and in both, the behavior described is the same as it is here - it's not set.  This points to a decision by the Zsh folks that this was their preferred behavior of the execution environment.  As we can't speculate as to why Apple did something, it's even more difficult to speculate why Zsh did/didn't do something and why Apple didn't modify it.  Though it's probably a safe bet that Apple just went with the defaults.\n\nA: I disagree with this answer.\nIt is not a matter of going with defaults. (\"Apple just went with the defaults.\"), but a matter of features.\nIn zsh the # symbol works like a regexp quantifier, providing extended globbing. So\nls fo#                                                                                                         \n\nmatches the files:\nf fo foo\n\nand so on, that is zero or more o. While the double # matches one or more characters, that is:\nls fo##\n\nmatches\nfo foo\n\nWhile for interactive use this type of globbing is convenient, in a script it is better to use proper regexps. In particular, ls is discouraged for scripts, because it cannot be parsed reliably, in favour of find, which sports a -regex option to execute a command for each matching path.\nBecause in (long) scripts comments are necessary, but we can do without hash-globbing, they are activated. Instead, in interactive use, it is assumed that the benefits of globbing outweigh the lack of  comments.\nIn Bash, there is no such a globbing feature, so it is conveninent to always have the commenting #. However, you can restore the interactive comments in zsh too with:\nsetopt interactive_comments\n\nIn this case, given:\nls fo#\nls fo # this is a comment \n\nthe first # works as a glob, the second after a space,  is a comment.\nYou can also disable extended globbing altogether with:\nunsetopt extended_glob\n\nThat being the case, and while zsh is in many ways superior to Bash, replacing Bash with zsh was a poor design choice.\nIn fact, zsh differs from Bash in several subtle ways, and your collection of one-liners might not work as expected.\nMicrosoft adopted a better approach when introducing their new shell: it was not the new default, but just a new (better) alternative.\n\nA: Not an answer but a work-around:\nThe bash/zsh do-nothing built-in command, :, can be used for simple end-of-line comments.  Beware though, because it is a command, not a comment, (a) you need to precede it with a ; and (b) it expands its arguments.  So, for example, : ... $(rm foo) or : ... ; rm foo will execute the command rm foo, which may not be what the reader is expecting.\n", "Q: Folder name change in Finder but not changed in Terminal iMac running Mojave 10.14.6\nI changed a folder name in Finder but I can't see the change in Terminal.\nold folder name: A.B\nnew folder name: A\nin Terminal ls still shows A.B\ncd . or cd .. then cd back won't change the ls outcome.\nin Finder using Go to Folder can go to the new folder name, however the Path bar at the bottom shows the new name but Copy as Pathname or New Terminal at Folder are using the old name.\nRestarting the iMac won't fix.\nWhat kind of bug is this?

They were still on my iCloud and when I looked into my iPad which synced these files and folders, they were all there. When I went to the terminal and entered one of the iCloud synced folders (e.g. Desktop) and did ls -a, the files and folders were not there.\nHave restarted Mac several times, restarted finder, still no luck. How to make those files and folders synced to iCloud reappear?\n\nA: In the end, after a couple of hours of frustration, I solved my problem by: Opening Finder > Finder Preferences > iCloud and uncheck all the options (on my Mac these were iCloud Drive, Desktop and Documents). Close preferences, reopen and recheck the same boxes. The files and folders reappeared in my finder.\n", "Q: In macOS settings, what is the difference between apps accessing to iCloud vs iCloud Drive I know the difference between iCloud and iCloud Drive. But I don't get what's happening if I allow – Mail for instance – to access iCloud or iCloud Drive.\nMail won't save my emails as files in a folder called \"Mail\" in iCloud Drive, so what will it do with the Drive and what would it do in iCloud (not drive)?\n\n\n\nA: There's really not much difference, but the way to generally look at is:\n\n*\n\n*iCloud is all the behind the scenes things like settings, scripts, messages, etc.\n\n\n*iCloud Drive is the user \"usable\" front end where you can directly access files and such as you normally would on a computer.\nLet's use Photos as an example... You don't really access Photos either via the actual photo files nor do you really need access to the Library (database) file.  All of this happens behind the scenes and you access your Photos via the Photos app whether it be on your Mac or your iDevice.  A third party app (Lightroom for example) would want access to your Photos so it might ask for permission to use \"iCloud.\"\nLooking at a different (random) app, maybe you get a \"Journaling\" app that lets you chronicle the day's events.  It saves it in a Rich Text format and can use any number of online services like iCloud Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, et al.  That may ask you for access to \"iCloud Drive\" because it's saving a file in the more traditional sense - to a common location where you save documents.\nGoing back to Mail, it may need access to both.  It will utilize the mail back end of \"iCloud\" to synchronize mail across the devices or access contacts, but will also utilize \"iCloud Drive\" as a place to save and get attachments.\nI applaud your diligence in questioning what Apps are asking for and this is an excellent line of questioning.  What you should also be looking for is what the app in question is accessing when it accesses iCloud or iCloud Drive - i.e. Contacts, location, mail etc.  I was recently looking for an IP subnet calculator (a networking thing) and it wanted access to my Photos and Location.  Needless to say, it didn't get downloaded.\n", "Q: Can you make Bluetooth hardware work out-of-the-box in Boot Camp? I have a Bluetooth keyboard (the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic) paired to OS X. When I boot into Windows, the only way I've found to get it to work is to manually put it into pairing mode again and pair it through the Windows Add a Bluetooth Device option. But then when I reboot back into OS X, the keyboard is disconnected and I have to re-pair again. Is there any way to keep it paired to both?\n\nA: No, this is not possible.\nLooking at this from the perspective your your keyboard, it believes it's connecting to two different machines.  When a pairing request is made, due to security, a \"key\" is generated at that time.  The keyboard and host exchange it - then \"agree\" it's genuine and proceed to pair.\nWhen you switch operating systems, say to macOS now, that OS has never seen your keyboard so when you attempt to pair, it doesn't work as there's no key.  So, you pair it and a new key gets generated, agreed that it's genuine and you continue your merry way, keyboarding happily until you switch OSes again.\nNow, the key your first OS had doesn't match what it expects from the keyboard and the whole pairing dance has to be repeated.  This is because your keyboard only supports a single pairing.  What you need is a keyboard that supports multiple devices like the Logitech MX series of products where it will support 3 different devices.  There are many of these out there besides Logitech (I personally use a Keychron K8), but some are definitely better than others at the pairing aspect, so be wary of that when selecting one.\n", "Q: Change mac id of usb-c to lan adapter I recently got a Macbook pro 13 inch and I bought this docking station for all the ports I need. The issue is that my university network requires registration of mac id to use internet in campus and it's a cumbersome process. I already have a windows laptop that is registered so I wanted to change the mac id to start using my macbook. I followed this article to change my mac id, but I noticed two interfaces en1 and bridge0 have the same mac id, and I can only change mac id for bridge0 interface. Although changing mac id of bridge0 interface changes the mac id displayed in the advanced properties of Thunderbolt Bridge service in Network Preferences I still can't access internet. I am quite new to Mac OS and changing these stuff were quite simple in Windows, is there any way I can achieve what I want??\nUpdate 1\nI had a portable Windows installation lying around and I used it to boot into Windows on my macbook and I can change mac id and access internet perfectly on Windows, so it can't be related to any faulty hardware.\nUpdate 2\nAfter again booting into mac os now the interface in properly recognized in Network Preference as USB 10/100/1000 LAN and new interface name en7. I guess I only had to reboot after intallation of drivers but mac os didn't prompt me to do so. I followed the same article I linked before and trying to change mac id results in an error with message:\nifconfig: ioctl (SIOCAIFADDR): Operation not supported on socket\n\nAlso, using spoofmac as suggested results in same error as spoof-mac uses the same method to change mac id.\n\nA: macOS has always been \"iffy\" when it came to spoofing MAC addresses unlike other OSes so it's not a (faulty) hardware issue.  It's more of a \"how Apple likes to do things\" issue.\nMy advice is the following (in order):\n\n*\n\n*Get that MAC address registered with the university.\n\n*Use SpoofMAC to, well, spoof your MAC address.\n\nYes, I think you should just bite the bullet and register your MAC with the university.  Yes, it's a PITA, but the downside is simply too costly for the time you're attempting to save.  If they happen to catch you (and they can), you're going to face disciplinary action because in the end, you agreed to their terms of service whether you remember agreeing to them or not.\nThat said, there are genuine uses for spoofing your MAC address and to do so on a Mac, you can use SpoofMAC.  It's available via GitHub (see link above) or via Homebrew.\nOnce you have it installed, you simiply execute the following command with the actual MAC address and your network device as needed:\n% spoof-mac.py set 00:00:00:00:00:00 en0\n\nThey also conveniently provide instructions for launching this at startup.\n", "Q: How can I install Pages or iWork on a Mac running High Sierra 10.13.6?

It’s as though the NFC chip is not enabled in the background.\nI tried on other iPhones and it worked properly. Is this an iPhone 11 issue?\n\nA: Turns out I was in Airplane mode, and the NFC chip is not enabled in the background when in Airplane mode.\nThe reason other NFC functions work (e.g. write, Apple Pay, etc) is because there is an explicit NFC foreground UI present, which turns on the chip even when in airplane mode.\nUnfortunately, this means you cannot have an NFC tag turn off airplane mode, for example.\n", "Q: Can I delete files in /Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Logs?

However, with respect to system load and beach balling, if the system cannot get data quickly, the CPU has to wait, the longer the CPU has to wait, then subsequent tasks have to wait as well.\nDrives:\ndisk0 - TOSHIBA MQ01ABD100 1.00 TB (Mechanical - 5400 RPM) \nInternal SATA 3 Gigabit Serial ATA\n\ndisk1 - Samsung SSD 840 EVO 250GB 250.06 GB (Solid State - TRIM: No) \nInternal SATA 6 Gigabit Serial ATA\n\nYou have your system on the faster SSD connected to the faster (SATA III) interface whereas your user data is on the slower HDD connected to the slower (SATA II) interface.  From this setup, you are literally making your CPU wait when user data must be accessed.\n32 Bit Apps\nCatalina doesn't support 32 bit apps so the fact that you're currently running 32 bit apps under Catalina says that you did an in-place upgrade of macOS.  In general, I'm not a fan of in place upgrades of any OS especially macOS.  Apple often makes (often radical) changes to things from one OS to another.  I have found that starting with a clean slate is usually the best course of action.  If you had issues prior to the upgrade, you will still have issues after the upgrade except they're possibly made worse by the differences in how things are done.\nI suggest doing a clean install of Catalina or Mojave if you can't live without those 32 bit Apps.\nDrive Layout\nThis is a confusing layout at best.  I think you wanted to segment your user data to the 1TB hard drive and leave the SSD for the system.  The problem with this is temporary files - that's usually stored on the system drive.  So, even in an ideal setup, you're still going to have that crossover where there seems to be duplicates on both drives.  The other issue, discussed earlier, is the disparity in transfer speeds; specifically the interfaces for each.  The primary is SATA III (6 Gbps) where as the secondary is SATA II (3Gpbs) - literally half the other.\nYour best bet here is to avoid this complex setup and just go with a single drive setup.  A simple 1TB SSD can be had for less than $100 USD makes this a simple and easy fix.  Connecting it to the SATA III interface will ensure it gets the highest throughput.  Then use the slower drive on the slower interface as your \"self contained\" Time Machine backup drive.\nThe next option here would be to create a Fusion Drive out of the two installed drives.  While it's not as fast performance wise as a pure SSD, you will definitely see better performance because it will manage what data resides on the spinning hard drive and what resides on the SSD.  You will also have greater capacity - 1.25TB - with greater flexibility to make use of.\nA third option is to get the 1TB SSD and use the existing 250GB SSD in a core storage volume and then use the 1TB HDD for backup.  You will just need an inexpensive USB to SATA adapter/enclosure.  This will give you a nice option for backups.\nTime Machine\nFrom EntreCheck:\nMajor Issues:\n  Anything that appears on this list needs immediate attention. \n  No Time Machine backup - Time Machine backup not found.\n\nThere's no point in running EntreCheck and not following it's recommendations.  You've got a well bodged setup and nary a lifeboat in sight!  From unsupported and unsigned apps (per EntreCheck) an overly convoluted drive setup I'm surprised that a backup isn't enabled on a nearly decade old machine!  Even if everything was perfect in it's setup, it could still fail due to old age!\nMy recommendation is to get a Time Machine backup going immediately!  There are so many issues that get asked about here on Ask Different that can easily be fixed with a restoration from a  Time Machine backup.\nWhile this is last on my list, it's actually the most important action you can take at this time.  Before attempting any fixes, you should tackle this first.\n", "Q: Will a 2015 MacBook logic board work on a 2016? I have an early 2016 MacBook A1534 with a failed SSD.\nI was thinking of buying a logic board from the A1534 early 2015. Everything looks fine by the looks of it all connections match up just fine.\nBut maybe there’s more I don’t know. Can anyone tell me if it will work? Could the pins be different?\nPicture on the left is a 2016 and on the right is a 2015.\n\n\n\nA: No, this will not work.\nIt's not the connectors you have to worry about, it's the screw hole locations and Apple is notorious for changing this very minor but critical detail to prevent this exact thing from happening.\nFor example, I just finished restoring a Mid-2007 (white) MacBook.  I ordered a bottom case (improperly listed as a 2007) and while every single connector lined up properly, it would not go in because of very subtle differences in where support posts and screw holes were placed - sometimes as little as a couple millimeters.\n\nCould the pins be different?\n\nAbsolutely!  Apple makes changes all of the time depending on the components they source.  The MacBook Pro's you referenced could very well have an issue where the pins are different.  After all, it's the 2016 MacBook Pro models that suffered the \"flexgate\" (display cable) issue where the 2015's did not.  The cable was made shorter and the back light power pins (21V) were moved too close to a data pin (3V) resulting in machines that had fried GPUs.\nMy advise is to have the SSD repaired.  There are firms out there that will do board level repair like this for about the same price as you're going to pay for a different logic board.\n", "Q: Big Sur Beta repeatedly will not install I have tried with the last 2 public betas, as well as dev beta 9 and 10 (the current beta) and no matter whether i choose to upgrade from my existing catalina install, or make a bootable usb of all 4 of these betas (i have tried them all), wipe my hard drive clean and then install from fresh, ALL of them give me the error: \"An error occurred preparing the software update\"\nThis occurs after the initial copying of files during big sur set up, the machine then reboots and gives a message like \"29 minutes remaining\". I then get the message above and the Mac is totally bricked. It can only be fixed by doing an internet recovery of Catalina and then restoring with Time Machine back up.\nA thorough search of the internet hasn't yielded any meaningful results aside from 1 thread on the dev forums where a few people had reported the same error and no answer was given.\nI am using a 27\" iMac 2019. Does anyone have any ideas what is causing this problem? I am now getting to the point that I'm worried I wont be able to actually install the final release when it is launched.\nThanks for any help you can give.\n\n\nA: This issue can still occur with the public release of Big Sur, 11.0.1.\nIn one case, this is network related. I don’t have the specifics but check to see if a simple restart of your modem solves the issue. If you are tech savvy enough to make sure you have obtained a new public IP, ensure that you do.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2011 has faulty power button - How do I enable any key or lid open boot settings? I'm working on an Early 2011 MacBook Pro 13\" which suffered a little water damage.\nAfter cleaning the system I can get it to turn on by disconnecting the battery, then reconnecting it and connecting the charger.  It automatically turns on and everything operates fine.\nIf I do a shutdown though, I have no way of turning it on without repeating the battery/charge sequence (which resets the date and time).  It doesn't respond to the power button press, any keyboard key presses or lid open.\nI was hoping there is a way to enable a \"turn on when lid open and/or any key\" type setting.  Is this possible?\nThe system is running MacOS X 10.12.6.\n\nA: Opening the lid to turn on a Mac only works if the Mac is asleep/hibernating.  If the power is off, it will need to be turned on.\nThe reason you have to disconnect the battery is because although your power settings may call for \"boot after power failure,\" there's never really a power failure if you're battery is connected (and has sufficient charge).\nThere's two ways you can address this:\n\n*\n\n*Short the power pads.  This is a \"stop gap\" way to turn on a Mac so that you don't have to disconnect the battery.  Simply bridge the two pads with the blade of a slotted screwdriver or, if you're really daring, solder a wire loop (long enough to come out of the case) with a momentary switch to make it more convenient.  This way, you don't have to keep opening the back cover.  It's a total bodge, but it'll get you by.\n\n\n\n*Replace the keyboard.  I actually reference this exact keyboard in this question/answer:  Keyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix.  Look under \"Replacing Keyboard\" in the Answer for specifics.  It's actually very inexpensive.  You may also be able to find the button by itself on eBay.\nI advise the latter.  You may be able to get away with only replacing the button rather than the whole keyboard, but either way, it's a better, more reliable fix.\n", "Q: Why My MacBook Pro’s battery is swollen and it don’t turn on nor charge? It’s 13 inch early 2015 My MacBook Pro’s battery is swollen and it don’t turn on nor charge?\nIt’s 13 inch early 2015.\nI found my MacBook dead suddenly . Later I opened it up but found that the battery is swollen and after that I tried to unplug the battery and turn on the Mac using AC POWER but it didn’t turn on?\n\nA: The MacBook Pro battery is based on lithium-ion technology. Swelling of the battery can be caused basically by two different things:\nThe functionality of the battery is based on chemical reactions within its components. These reactions happen when you charge the battery, and when you use it to power your device. However, as time passed, this reaction is no longer perfect, and gas can be produced as a byproduct. This gas makes the battery swell.\nThe second cause is that the battery is internally structured in \"compartments\" that are seperated from each other. If for some reason tiny holes occur in the membranes that make out the separation, then moisture from the air could make it into the battery and react with the chemicals. This can cause swelling as well.\nIn either case, a swollen battery is not fit to be used - and should be handled very cautiously as it is a safety issue as well. A swollen battery could break out in fire spontaneously.\nI would suggest disposing of the battery via the correct channels immediately.\nThe battery needs to be replaced with a new battery in order for you laptop to function again.\n", "Q: Before Catalina, do live photos count as both photo and video in the \"Photos\" app tally? I'm just wondering whether live photos were counted twice because they were photos but also videos. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: No, they weren't counted twice in Mojave for example.\n", "Q: How to turn off display by pressing the power button of MacBook Pro 2016? (Changing the behaviors of the power buttons) I'd like to know how to change the behaviors of the power button of the MacBook Pro to have \"turn off display\" function. (As far as I know, default setting of a single press of the button gives you nothing or switching users depending on situations.)\nI noticed a similar question was asked many years ago in the link below.\nHow do you change the behavior of the power button in Lion?\nHowever, this terminal tip is outdated (press to sleep is not default anymore) and I want to have the display turned off instead of hibernating the whole system or popping up a dialogue. My university Ethernet disconnects any hibernated devices and that's why I'd just like to have the display off (and locked simultaneously).\n(I added \"turn off display\" button at the far-right side of the Touch Bar, but it's definitely a waste of Touch Bar real estate. More Touch Bar space for scribbling videos is desired...)\nAs I couldn't find anything that satisfies my situations above, let me ask you all. ‍♂️\n\nA: Unfortunately, what you're asking cannot be done.\nIn fact both issues have been brought up before, numerous times here on Ask Different so it's technically a duplicate, but it's difficult to do a \"double duplicate\" so, see below for supporting links on each topic.\n\n*\n\n*There's no way to disable the internal display\n\n*\n\n*Can.

The power button has to do with controlling the state of your Mac:  on/off/sleep.  The display's state of being on/off is not a setting you can control outside of \"power.\"\nAdditionally, commands are not outdated simply because they're dated.  They become dated when it no longer functions  in subsequent changes like OS or hardware updates.  Currently, the power button still controls sleep/hibernation.  See:  https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/log-out-sleep-restart-or-shut-down-mchlp2522/mac\n\nA: As far as I know there's no Apple supported method of changing the power button behavior like that.\n", "Q: Face time in a middle east version of iPhone in India I am planning to buy an iPhone 12 pro for my brother who is in Dubai now. But after a few months, he will go back to India.\nMiddle East version of the iPhone doesn't have face time installed by default because it is not supported in UAE. But, If he takes his iPhone to India, can he install and use the face time in India? We buy only the unlocked version.\nI checked with the iPhone customer care. They say, ”it is completely based on the carrier you are using”. If I ask my service provider they are asking me to check with iPhone support.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I would not expect FaceTime to work if you unlock a phone purchased in Middle East.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204042\n\nFaceTime may be unavailable if your device originates from this country or region and becomes unlocked or is used in another country or region.\n\nThe footnote is very broadly worded. My presumption is that phones sold in the entire region have legal or contractual restrictions causing FaceTime to be bound to specific carriers and/or the device remain in specific geographical boundaries for FaceTime to operate or be blocked. It’s unlikely even if you export it closed box and do first activation in India that you would bypass UAE intended restrictions.  However, Apple did write this as a footnote, so I can’t say you’re out of luck across the board.\nIf you are uncertain when it’s time to spend your cash, be sure the return policy lets you test in India soon enough to return the device if you can’t be sure the features you need will work with the eventual carrier and eventual location. (Or be OK with whatever profit or loss you take reselling a “brand new phone” locally is acceptable risk)\n\nA: Thanks, @bmike. FaceTime is working fine in India.\nMy brother had to travel back to India earlier than expected. So he unboxed it and created/activated account from India. It took 24 hours to get the FaceTime active, but then it started working fine.\nTo conclude, in my case, the Middle-east's unlocked version of iPhone and unboxed/activated the Apple Id from India doesn't have any issue in using FaceTime.\n", "Q: MacBook restarts when idle MacBook Pro 2019 13\" If I don't use the laptop, it goes into sleep mode about 5-10 minutes.

I unenrolled from macOS Big Sur beta program, however I am still getting the 11.0.1 \"update is available\" notification. I would like to remove this so that I upgrade directly to 11.0 when GM is released. I don't want to install 11.0.1. Is there a way to delete cached update data so I only get 11.0 when it's eventually released?\n\n\nA: The following Terminal command will stop your Mac from accessing the software update catalog for Beta software:\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL\n\nYou might need a restart, or relaunch of System Prefs and Command R to reload the Software Update pane at least.\n", "Q: Screen capturing Android tablet via Mac I'm working on a project that requires me to screen-capture game play from a game on a Pixel C tablet, but I have an iMac.  I'm wondering if there's a way for me to plug the tablet into the iMac and get the tablet's screen to show up on my iMac screen so I can record the game play footage.\nDoes anyone know if this is possible?  Or know an alternate way to record the screen from an Android tablet via a Mac?\n\nA: From a Mac perspective, this is no different than capturing video from an analog or digital source.\nDepending on the output of the Android Tablet, you can use an  analog capture device  or a digital (HDMI/DisplayPort) capture device.  That interace will allow you to input the video to your Mac.  You'll also need capture software (these devices come with it).  I have used both and currently use the HD60S for capturing output from all sorts of devices like laptops, iPads/iPhones, an XBox (not much) and a DVD/VHS player for trans-coding old movies.\nThe critical part comes down to your Android tablet and what video adapters it supports.  Basically you need an adapter like the Lightning to Digital AV Adapter that allows you to connect an iPad/iPhone to a screen or projector but one made for Android - an Android to HDMI adapter.  Unfortunately, that's not something I can recommend as Android isn't very much discussed here (and I personally avoid Android like the plague - my experience is limited here).\nHowever, you connect that adapter into the video capture device described above, and you can record game play to your hearts content.\n\nA: If you don't mind enabling developer mode in the Android Tablet and enabling adb debugging, scrcpy is a great utility you can install on MacOS to show your Android Tablet display live in a window in MacOS.\nThen you can do still screen captures, make video recordings from your Mac screen (using Quicktime, for example), demo something on your Android Tablet to others in a Teams meeting with screen sharing, and so on.\n", "Q: Remove or edit a synthetic.conf file in etc/ I have a Mac in which the user has placed a synthetic.conf file in etc/\nThe file contains an entry for home creating a synthetic link to some directory. This makes it unbootable. Normally the computer is running Catalina. I can boot it using a Mojave startup that was still on the drive. I have admin privileges.\nI would like to delete or edit that file. I can't even find it. This problem is beyond me.\n\nA: To edit or remove synthetic.conf when it is causing catalina not to boot or login to your user, you must first boot into Recovery mode (hold down CMD+R during he boot sound). Then from the Utilities menu open the Terminal.\nIf you have FileVault enabled you will need to unlock the boot drive (there are other questions with answers on how to do this from the terminal so I wont repeat those here).\nProvided that you have unlocked the boot drive you should be able to use the ‘find’ utility to locate your synthetic.conf like this:\ncd /\nfind / -name synthetic.conf\n\nFor me it was inside a ‘private’ folder.\nThen you can delete it with ‘rm’ or edit it with ‘vi’ if you’re feeling brave; I just deleted mine. Turns out that if you put spaces in it, instead of tabs, it causes your system not to boot on Catalina - What a great feature Apple :-)\n\nA: I installed Catalina on an external drive and then using the terminal I was able to navigate to the original etc directory and delete the synthetic.conf file, and then able to boot from the internal drive.\n", "Q: Does Sidecar support sound? Apple Sidecar for Mac is a great way to use the iPad as a secondary screen.\nHowever it appears that there is no support for sound. Is this correct, or am I doing something wrong?\nI am on MacOS Catalina and iPadOS 14.1\n\nA: Sidecar extends your display and audio is not a component of a display.\n\n*\n\n*Use your iPad as a second display for your Mac with Sidecar\nThis is just another way to extend your desktop with another monitor.  When you do that, you don't extend your audio as well.  Audio is a different entity all together.  In the support document linked above, there's no mention, whatsoever of audio.\nIt's probably confusing that when you connect a monitor with built in speakers via an HDMI cable that the display supports audio.  That's not entirely accurate - as stated before, display and audio to macOS are two distinct entities.  It will see the speakers of the display as an audio device and you have the option to send audio there or to the internal speakers or to any other connected audio device.  So, while it's built in, they're not tied together.\nSidecar doesn't make the speakers of the iPad appear as audio devices to your Mac.\n\nA: You just connect Airfoil, and then SideCar\n.\nAnd if you want to use your [iPad and Mac] Speakers at the same time, use MacOS's Audio Midi\n.\nHave a nice day! \n", "Q: How do I know which Bluetooth chipset is being used by the iphone?

Resetting the PRAM and SMC (in any conceivable order several times) did not seem to work.\n\nA: It turned out to be a hardware issue. One of the connectors was loose. It’s the  rossmann group details what exactly happens: briefly it’s the connector near the hinge of the laptop that causes a BSOD, by (I think) sending the LCD power rail straight to the CPU and tripping the protection features.

You can fix that by changing the regular expression (outside the scope of this question), but I'll suggest using jq. It lets you use a command line utility to parse JSON data. Again, if you're connecting to that server with an IPv4 address, then this change won't be needed (until your ISP in the future updates you to an IPv6 address).\nI therefore end up with\n\"%F{white}%M %n %y %j $(curl -s https://api.myip.com | jq .ip -r) %F{green}%2c%F{blue} [%f \"\n\n", "Q: How to update to ios 14 How do i restore my phone from the beta version back to the original ios 14 version.

I highlight quite a bit of pdfs regularly. The one solution, although extremely inefficient, I found is to save and close the file regularly after 1 or 2 new highlights and open it again. Even with this, unfortunately, the highlights are not saved properly 10 to 20% of the time. Anything more than 2 highlight changes, I am certain they all are not saved 90% of the time.\nMy question is if there is a keyboard shortcut to open a recently closed preview file? It's a pain to right-click preview every time and open the just-closed file from the list? Any ideas to avoid this problem with preview is also very welcome. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: \nMy question is if there is a keyboard shortcut to open a recently closed preview file?\n\nThe following was tested in macOS Catalina 10.15.6 and worked for me while Preview has focus. (No third-party applications needed.)\nIf you just want to open the most recently closed document in Preview, then the following example AppleScript code used in a Run AppleScript action in an Automator Service/Quick Action and assigned a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services can do it.\n\n*\n\n*In the Run AppleScript action in the Automator Service/Quick Action, replace the default AppleScript code with the following example AppleScript code:\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click first menu item of ¬\n        menu 1 of menu item \"Open Recent\" of ¬\n        menu 1 of menu bar item \"File\" of ¬\n        menu bar 1 of application process \"Preview\"\n\n\n\nIf you want to choose from the Open Recent menu in Preview, then the following example AppleScript code used in a Run AppleScript action in an Automator Service/Quick Action workflow and assigned a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services can do it.\n\n*\n\n*In the Run AppleScript action in the Automator Service/Quick Action, replace the default AppleScript code with the following example AppleScript code:\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    set OpenRecentMenuList to ¬\n        get name of menu items of ¬\n            menu 1 of menu item \"Open Recent\" of ¬\n            menu 1 of menu bar item \"File\" of ¬\n            menu bar 1 of application process \"Preview\"\n\nif the number of items in OpenRecentMenuList is greater than 2 then\n    set OpenRecentList to items 1 thru -3 of OpenRecentMenuList\nelse\n    display dialog \"The Open Recent menu is empty.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n    return\nend if\n\nset menuItem to (choose from list OpenRecentList) as string\n\nif menuItem is \"false\" then return\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click menu item menuItem of ¬\n        menu 1 of menu item \"Open Recent\" of ¬\n        menu 1 of menu bar item \"File\" of ¬\n        menu bar 1 of application process \"Preview\"\n\n\n\nI assigned the following keyboard shortcut to the Automator Service/Quick Action in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\n\n\nNote: The usual security caveats apply. Permissions will need to be granted as prompted and or required in: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy >\n\nThe example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted.\n\nA: There isn't a built-in menu command \"Open the last document\" (or similar), so there's nothing you can apply a key command to.\nYou may be able to create an AppleScript that simulates clicking 'the first item' in the \"Open Recent\" submenu, whatever that may be. You'd then need to trigger that script as a Service with a key command in System Preferences > Keyboard.\nTo be frank, if Preview is still not behaving 100% of the time with this fix, then you're better off using a different PDF Viewer/editor. Foxit Reader is one of many that are free with highlighting built in, and has many advantages over Preview.\n\nA: One way of achieving desired result is to use Finder's Recent window:\n\n*\n\n*⇧-⌘-F: open the Recents window, showing all of the files you viewed or changed recently.\n\n*open recent file from Recents window\n\n*make changes, save, close file (⌘-W)\n\n*⌘-Tab to make Finder's Recents window active\n\n*file you opened earlier is selected, press ⌘-O to open it again\n\nAlternatively, if you don't mind closing application altogether and opening it again, close file and application with ⌘-Q and you will be directly back in Recents window where file is selected. Then just open it with ⌘-O.\nIt's two key presses after closing the file and application. It works on all recents files not only files used with Preview.\nTo be clear - it works from whatever Finder window. So navigating to file using Finder and opening from there will deliver same results - after closing file (or file along with application) fall back to Finder window and open file again.\n", "Q: Should I turn the iPhone 12 out of the box? I just bought myself an Apple iPhone 12 -- my first iPhone. Should I turn it on and start using it “out of the box” or should I charge the phone first and then when its full, turn it on?\n\nA: A new iPhone comes with around 50% charge on its battery. You can start using it out of the box and there's no need to charge it fully before starting to use it.\nWhile it may not currently be applicable on an iPhone 12, if there's a newer version of iOS available for your model of iPhone, you may need to plug it into power outlet if you wish to install and update to the latest version of iOS. And that too would be required only after you have finished setting up the device.\nBut generally speaking, an iPhone battery is charged at factory to enabled it to be used out of the box while also ensuring that the battery chemistry remains intact while in shipment.\n\nA: Tear off the wrapping and start immediately.\nYou can’t tell the battery level until you turn it on, so it’s a bit of a moot point waiting as when you start charging, it’s now on.\nUnless you really love suspense and want to charge it and prepare yourself for running the assistant in a different network or location, the phone experience is designed to be ready when you are.\n", "Q: Triple boot Catalina 10.15.7, windows 10 (not bootcamp but NTFS), Ubuntu 20.10 I am using a 1 TB SSD with a macbook pro 2012 initially split into 2 x 500g: Catalina and Windows 10 NTFS (NON bootcamp partition). To install Ubuntu, I had to use the Catalina partition because the Windows partition would not allow me to partition it. So I end up having a 250G Catalina partition, a 250g Ubuntu partition along with a 500G Windows 10 partition.\nBoth, Catalina and Windows 10 (non bootcamp) partitions were running perfectly before the Ubuntu install. The Linux installs went very well. I have used David Anderson install process. Here is the link:\nHow can I triple boot MacOS Catalina , Ubuntu 18.04, and Windows 10\nI did follow the step very carefully. The result was a fully working and fast Ubuntu partition. This thing shot down in less than 3 seconds and boot in less then 10. Anyway, I manage to install Refind which made all 3 partitions appear on startups. After booting Catalina and Ubuntu with success, the Windows partition fails to do so, showing instead this message:\n** No bootable device, insert boot disk and press enter. **\nThis is usually called for a bootcamp partition problem but it seems the Ubuntu install, particularly the step where we use grub, and the step where we need to prevent hybrid disk use, may have or probably did broke something into Windows NTFS partition.\nI am new to all this stuff so bear with me.\nWhat I did next? I install the third party software gdisk and ran the thing into recovery mode. Here is a link of the procedure :\nBootcamp: no bootable device – insert boot disk and press any key\nI followed the steps carefully hoping the hybrid state would fix the window partition and keep Catalina and Ubuntu running. It was a long shot I guess. The result was as expected: bad. Ubuntu is not showing up into the boot menu ; refind does not work anymore, and when I use the Mac option startup menu, Catalina and Windows hard disk do show up but Windows won’t boot. I get this message:\n** Error loading operating system_**\nNo doubt the hybrid part seems to have broken both Windows and Ubuntu along with Refind. Nothing can be done from that message window except restarting the mac from the power button.\nOnce I boot into Catalina, the Windows 10 partition still shows up on the desktop. All files are there. The Ubuntu partition is still visible in disk utility partition view. It is located right between Catalina and Windows partition as you can see on the screenshot. By the way Windows partitin is the \"OS\" one.\n\nEven when Ubuntu was booting perfectly, it did not show up anywhere except in disk utility partition view or on startup when Refind was still working before the gdisk process.\nSo, I guess the problem may come from the fact that Ubuntu was installed in second position because the NTFS Windows partition is non-partition-able.\nAny idea to fix this?\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu 20.10 when macOS 10.15.7 Catalina and Windows 10 (version 20H2) have already been installed.\nThis answer assumes Windows is installed to BIOS boot. This can be verified by viewing the contents of the Windows Disk Management application window. Below is an example when Windows BIOS boots. Volume (Disk 0 partition 1) has a status of Healthy (GPT Protective Partition).\n\n\nNote: To get a better look at an image, either click on the image or open the image in a new window.\n\nBelow is what would appear when Windows EFI boots. Volume (Disk 0 partition 1) has a status of Healthy (EFI System Partition).\n\nBelow are the basic steps.\n\n*\n\n*Use the macOS Disk Utility application or diskutil command to create a ExFAT partition which will be to contain the Ubuntu installation. Below is an example for the use of the diskutil command.\nThe output from diskutil list disk0 is shown below. This shows the partitioning before adding the new ExFAT partition.\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.2 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         578.6 GB   disk0s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data OS                      578.6 GB   disk0s3\n\nThe command given below gives approximately have the space used by the APFS container to the new ExFAT partition.

First, the diskutil command added enough partitions so the Windows partition no longer is included in the 4 entries allowed in the Master Boot Record (MBR) table. Second, the installation of Ubuntu removed any existed hybrid partitioning required by Windows. The easiest solution would be to recreate hybrid partitioning so the Windows partition would be included in the MBR table. Below are the steps that would include partitions 2, 4, and 5 in the the MBR table. The fifth partition is the Windows partition.\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu.\n\n\n*Press the control+option+T key combination to open an Terminal window.\n\n\n*Enter the command given below.\nsudo gdisk /dev/sda\n\n\n\n*The gdisk command is interactive.

Below are the commands to enter.\nr\nh\n2 4 5\ny\nff\nn\n83\nn\n07\ny\nw\ny\n\n\n\n*Select Quit Terminal from the Terminal pull‑down on the menu bar.\nI should also mention that rEFInd can be configured to execute gdisk. See Installing Additional Components on Rod Smith's The rEFInd Boot Manager: Installing rEFInd webpage.\nThe problem with this solution is the third partition was omitted from the MBR table. The macOS operating system has a tendency to rectify this omission.. This can happen when the Mac starts or restarts to macOS. Or, when the Disk Utility application or diskutil command is used to erase, format and/or partition a disk. The result is gdisk may need to be employed repeatedly to remedy the situation. This is why my other answer may be a better choice.\n", "Q: 100GB of system data I was trying to update my iPhone with iOS 14.1\nI was told that I didn't have enough storage left, I was very surprised since I'm using about 10 of my 128 gigabytes available\nAfter investigation, it appears that the 114GB is used for \"other system data\", which seems absurd.\nHow to free up this space? (I guess most of it is irrelevant)\n\n\nA: If possible, try deleting an app or two (optimally, one with some data stored on the iPhone) and see if this changes. If it goes up, this could be a \"known\" bug, in which case the only solution I'm aware of is, sadly, the nuclear option....  wipe the iPhone from Settings, and restore from backup (make sure to backup first!).\n\nA: After saving some space to download the update and installing it, the bug has been fixed.\nOnly 9GB are used in this category.\n", "Q: Connecting 2 monitors and peripherals to a 2017 MacBook Pro I have a 2017 MacBook Pro (13 inch with two Thunderbolt 3 ports). I wanted to connect 2 monitors as well as a mouse and keyboard to it for work. I was wondering if this would be too much of a workload for the Mac  or if this is a normal thing to do with such a device.\nI was looking at either buying a Henge dock or a cheaper option such as this 14 in one USB C hub  I found on Amazon.\nDoes the adapter make a difference for this too?\n\nA: \nI was wondering if this would be too much of a workload for the Mac  or if this is a normal thing to do with such a device.\n\nWhat is \"normal\" is very subjective. What you actually intend to do with your Mac is what determines if it's capable of handling the processing load.\nThis model is capable of handling two external displays up to 4K each but that doesn't mean you're going to be driving high intensity graphics apps like gaming or video production with this configuration.\n\n*\n\n*There's no discrete GPU meaning it utilizes your CPU display chipset and up to 1.5GB of system RAM for video memory\n\n*There's only one Thunderbolt chip so, your video bandwidth is limited.\n\nAlso, just because a computer can do something (it has the capability) doesn't mean it's sized appropriately for doing that thing long term.  Example:  just because you have the ability to plug in two display's to your MacBook Pro without a discrete GPU doesn't mean you that you've sized it right - you probably should have purchased the 15\" with 4 Thunderbolt port model with Radeon GPU.  It's even possible you should have gone with a desktop.\n\n*\n\n*External Monitor Blurry text and Sluggy Mouse on MBP 2020\n\n*A1398 2015 - inadequate fan behaviour/noise\n\n*Adjusting graphics cards settings in Mojoave to reduce overheating with external monitor (MacBookPro2018)\n\nI was looking at either buying a Henge dock or a cheaper option [USB Hub] .... Does the adapter make a difference for this too?\n\nYes! That device you linked to is a USB Hub.  Meaning, all the benefits of Thunderbolt will go unused.  If you want to get the best possible performance out of your machine, you need to use the components that will make the best possible use out of the resources you have.  Get a proper Thunderbolt Dock instead.\nThe Henge dock, does nothing more than take your TB ports and move them so you can have the Mac \"in an upright and closed position.\"  Other than being slick, it gives you no audio, video, Ethernet, USB...nothing.

It will affect all your other privacy/location settings as well.\nBut, once this has been reset, you should be prompted to trust the iOS device when it reconnects to your Mac. Once the two devices have trusted each other, the plist file in the Mac's Lockdown folder should be overwritten with the new trusted plist.\nIf you really want to remove the lockdown plist manually, I am not too sure how Catalina works with the separate OS system partition, as I am on macOS Mojave. But on macOS Mojave, you need to have SIP disabled and remove the plist through rootless. Only do this if you are comfortable with using rootless. If you are not comfortable using rootless, reseting privacy and location settings on the iOS device should be more than enough.\nHowever, if you decide to use rootless, you really shouldn't remove the entire lockdown folder, but rather the specific plist for the UDID associated with your iOS device.\nYou can find the UDID of the iOS device (when connected) in macOS's System Information>USB>Serial number. Alternatively, run the  command system_profiler SPUSBDataType and look for the serial number for the iPhone. The iPhone should still show up in System information when it's physically connected via USB, even if you can't access it in Finder.\nOnce you have found your UDID, note it down (because the serial number doesn't contain a hyphen, but there is one in the UDID's plist filename).\nNow you will have to go into rootless, which you can do through terminal using sudo su - command, and navigate to the lockdown directory (on macOS Mojave it's /var/db/lockdown) and list all the files in the directory, and look for the plist with a filename that matches your UDID of your iOS device (again there should be a hyphen in the filename somewhere).\nYou should then be fine to remove the file (still in rootless) using the rm command, you don't need to use sudo rm in rootless. For me (on Mojave), the command to remove the plist in rootless is rm /var/db/lockdown/UDIDnumber.plist.\nWhen you are finished in rootless, remember to logout by pressing Control+D in terminal. Once again, don't use rootless if you are not comfortable with it. So, be VERY CAREFUL using rootless.\nLet me know if this solves your problems. I know there's a few trust issue bugs with iOS devices connecting to some Macs (but not all?) or only when hotspot is turned on. But hopefully this won't be your issue.\n\nA: What did help finally was the update to iOS 14.2.\nThings just started to work again.\n", "Q: Developer of a tool says I need to run an exe file and chmod it on mac I am trying to use a tool written to help convert output of one program to a file useable by another.\nThe tool when downloaded is a lot of files and a .exe file.\nI assumed this is not the Mac version, but the developer says that it runs on Mac OS and I need to CHMOD +x it and it will run.\nI can't even get to the stage of trying that as my mac defaults to use the Unarchiver for  .exe files.

On iPhone Messages, SMS text messages come through from political groups and all kinds of other nonsense.  These are not phone numbers I interact with.  Some of them are short codes?\nWhy don't they all go to the \"Unknown Senders\" tab, since I have that setting turned on?\n\nA: From Apple documentation:\n\nYou can filter iMessages from people who aren't saved in your\nContacts.\n\nThere is difference between iMessages and SMS/MMS. You can read about it in Apple documentation: About iMessage and SMS/MMS\nBased on that it is relatively safe to assume that if you have SMS (text in green bubbles) then filtering doesn't apply.\n", "Q: Is uninstalling apps on iOS thorough? first of all, my as accurate as possible definition for \"thorough\":\n\n*\n\n*No executables (binary, scripts etc.) left on the iOS device\n\n*The application itself and the provider of the application has no way of utilizing the computing power of the iOS device (browsing the homepage of the app provider in a browser doesn't count, apparently)\n\n*Configuration files need not to be cleaned, and can stay unless these configuration files somehow can be executed on the iOS device\n\nAnd this is going to be a multi-faced question so a rather comprehensive answer is expected but not required, feel free to give your input.\nI'm from one of the Asian countries that are notorious for censoring internet access and monitoring citizens' digital devices.\nBecause of work I have to install several iOS apps that is developed within my country, and it is pretty much open secret that these apps monitor user behaviors and collect privacy data. The former employees say it out loud on social media without qualms, the CTO made it plain that they cooperate with the authority and news reports every now and then reveal people (usually criminals but who knows) get caught  because the police simply pull the chat log stored on a server somewhere.\nI plan to migrate all these apps to another phone, and uninstall them from my iOS device so I could chat more freely with my love interest, (so xe could send me risque pictures, there, I said it)\nSo here's the question, is the unintallment thorough? Will apps leave binaries, scripts and other executables on my device, even if I uninstalled the app?\nMy phone is genuine, from original manufacture, not rooted or jailbroken at all\nI understand if it's linux core OS we are talking about I probably shouldn't worry all that much but iOS is basically a closed-source BSD system, I want to be sure.\nIf you think there are exploits and flaws in the iOS itself and could be exploited by apps, feel free to inform me also, much appreciated.\nEdit:I wasn't talking about iOS itself, I have confidence in it (else I wouldn't buy an iPhone to begin with), I'm talking about whether APPs could find exploits to continue running/semi-running on the device. I hope I make sense.\n\nA: Yes, app uninstallation on iOS is very thorough. The app is in a normal circumstance not able to leave behind executable bits and pieces to infiltrate your phone, spend resources or otherwise change the behavior of the phone.\nNote that the app might leave data behind in the iCloud, in your Keychain and other places - but it is data, not executables.\nThe reason I write \"normal circumstances\" is that you're considering app made by national states for the express purpose of spying. In that case, it is possible that the app exploits some kind of vulnerability in iOS that allows it to alter your system permanently. This would have to be done without somehow alerting Apple to it in their reviews. I wouldn't consider it likely for almost any app though.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2019 suddenly dead and does not turn on While I was doing a heavy task using my MacBook pro 2019, it got freeze suddenly (the color wheel keeps spinning). Then after 1 or 2 seconds the MacBook Pro suddenly shut down. Now it is not turning on. There is even no screen indicator or no chime when I plug the charger. Also, I did SMC reset and NVRAM reset. But still no luck. What should be the reason for that and what are the possible solutions?\n\n*\n\n*No errors in the screen\n\n*No sound\n\n\nA: When you have power issues, the most likely cause is hardware.\n\n*\n\n*Follow precisely the steps to reset your SMC\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\nThis is something you want to do once, not regularly reset it - more than three resets in a month = a trip to repair for us at work.\nYour machine has a T2 chip, so that also controls power on, so in rare cases if you can't boot to external media / Internet Recovery, you might have success reviving or restoring the firmware portion of the T2 system which can make all the data unrecoverable - so also read that through a couple times before attempting any portion in the middle.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-2/revive-or-restore-mac-firmware-apdebea5be51/mac\nWhen these steps fail or you decide it’s hardware, seek someone trained to diagnose and repair your mac. Good options are at the consultant and Apple service locations listed at https://locate.apple.com\n", "Q: Is there a way to see what time a message was sent? There are many websites that incorrectly claim that you can do this by swiping left and holding within the Messages app, but this actually shows the times that the messages were received, not sent.\nI'm talking about a situation in which the sender or recipient doesn't have reception, the recipient's phone is off, etc. The Android Messages app shows both sending and receipt time, which I find very handy.\nIs there a way to see on an iPhone what time a message that I received was sent?\n\nA: Generally, no.\nThe only easy source of send times is visual inspection on the sending device.\nForensic analysis of the message database would be needed to get more precision or data that is not displayed by the iOS app.\n\n*\n\n*https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2020/10/the-forensic-view-of-imessage-security/\nThere will be server logs in some cases (SMS being less secure / more logged than Apple as a carrier using iCloud and your AppleID for delivery) as well, but on the receiving device you will likely need to jailbreak it and dig into the database and log files.\n", "Q: Unable to create Shortcut for creating new note in Evernote I am trying to create a Shortcut that will create a new note in Evernote. It should ask me to enter some text for the note.\nIn my Shortcut app, I create a new Shortcut and for Content I select Shortcut Input. But when I run this Shortcut, it simply creates an empty note in Evernote and does not ask me for any input text. Below is the screenshot.\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\n\nA: You need to use the 'Ask for Input' action before the Evernote app.\nThis way, you will be asked to enter text that can then be used in Evernote (with the 'Provided Input' variable).\nNote that the 'Shortcut Input' variable takes the content from where you called it (for example a website in the share sheet).\n", "Q: Cronjob macOS does not work if set with a bash external script I'm trying to create a new cronjob which launches a script every time at startup.

Any ideas why it is not working, and how can I get it to run?\n\nA: There is no need to check whether there currently is a crontab installed or not. Just run\n(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo '@reboot bash /Users/user/myscript.sh') | crontab -\n\nto add the @reboot line to your crontab (or create a new one).\n\nA: Solved. Crontab needs \\n at the end of the latest line to execute commands:\nvar=$(crontab -l 2> /dev/null);\nvalue=$(echo $?);\nscript='@reboot bash /Users/angelorosa/script.sh';\n\nif [[ $value = 0 ]];\nthen\n    printf \"$var\\n$script\\n\" | crontab;\nelse\n    printf \"$script \\n\" | crontab;\nfi\n\n", "Q: Catalina install error for EVERYTHING \"The operation couldn’t be completed.

However since the last iOS update I can’t seem to restrict Chrome anymore. The apps are just missing from the \"Always Allowed\" screen.\nHow can you limit access to the internet on an iOS device to certain hours? It feels like a bug to only be able to limit every other app on your phone!\n\n\nA: I have found a solution! It's not perfect, but I've been testing it and it just about works:\n\n*\n\n*In Chrome, on the device in question, go to this address: chrome://flags/\n\n*Then search for \"screentime\" (all one word).\n\n*You should see: Enables ScreenTime Integration\n\n*Switch this to ENABLED.\n\nIt's a bit glitchy, but it works. It locks Chrome in the way you'd expect it to.\nIn the meantime, tell the developers how important this is to you here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1162695\nIt seems the longterm plan might be for Chrome to fully support Screen Time (like Safari does), allowing users to manually allow access to specific websites during Downtime.\nMore information: https://www.chromestory.com/2020/09/chrome-ios-screen-time/\nIt's unclear when this feature will be added however.\n\nA: Just to add my findings to this. It seems that chrome is not visible as an app to set screen time for when setting the child’s limit from the parent phone. However when I opened screen time on my kid’s iPad, I could enable chrome screen time rules there.\nPS: I did enable screen time flags in chrome as posted above as well.\n", "Q: Macbook resetting itself when playing a game I have a problem with my MacBook Air 2017 and I need help.\nI was playing Heart of Iron 4 on my Macbook Air and all of sudden, my Macbook Air restarted itself.\nI restarted it and now I have this annoying fan sound running all the time and my battery percentage disappeared, I went through the setting to enable \"Show battery percentage\" but it keeps disappearing after enabling it.\nCan I fix it myself or do I have to go in-store to fix it?\n\nA: While it might be a little late, this sounds like an overheating issue. I would advise you to try and keep it well ventilated, and if possible have it serviced, even diagnostically. For example, blow some compressed air to clear the dust.\nI would also recommend someone open it up, and clean off the dust manually, as compressed air is barely sufficient to fix these issues. If you can, also try to install a a temperature monitor and fan control program. While you did manage to fix the symptom by resetting the management controller, this will come back.\n\nA: I figured it out, just do an SMC reset on your MacBook Air.\n", "Q: How to connect to a particular share after automatic connection to a network drive after a Mac start up? There are solutions I can find how to automatically connect to a network drive whenever the Mac starts up, such as\nsmb://synology.local\n\nBut this drive has many shares, such as Public, Private and Backup.\nHow would you automatically connect to Backup as well, assuming some other automated tool needs to access the path /Volumes/Backup?  (using any Settings, app, or Bash / Zsh commands or script that can be added to system startup?)\n\nA: Just connect to the share that you want to connect to on startup.\nThen, add that to your Login Items under your account in User & Groups in your Systems Preferences.\nMake sure that you save the password to the volume when connecting, otherwise you'll have to enter on connecting.\n\nA: I think I found the answer: when we connect to a network drive using System Preferences, we actually specify the share to connect, so using the instructions such as on:\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21600/mount-a-windows-share-in-os-x-and-have-it-reconnect-at-login/\nWe'd actually specify to connect to\nsmb://synology.local/Public\nsmb://synology.local/Backup\n\nor any other shares at system start up.\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to look through a directory, preview file by file, and choose to keep or delete it? I'm mostly looking to do an initial pass of a folder of 10k images and I want to go through one by one and mark each for deletion or for keeping. Any easy way to do that on a mac or is there a photo organization program that will do this?\n\nA: Open the directory then instead of opening the image, you can press space to open a preview of that image. Now you can navigate through the images using your arrow ( ←→ ) keys.\nIf you want to delete any one of them then just go back to finder and the same image will be selected that you were previewing.\n\nA: The Finder has four 'View' styles: Icon, List, Column, and the last one, which is either called \"Cover Flow\" or \"Gallery View\", depending on what version of OS you have.\nThis view lets you scroll through successive QuickLook Previews of each image in the folder.\nYou can select Gallery View by clicking on the icon in the Toolbar that selects the view, or using the View menu, or with Command 4.\n\nA: Since you are talking about images, here's three methods I use:\nFirst:\nOpen the directory in Column view.\nMinimize all the higher columns by grabbing the vertical divider and dragging it the the left.\nSelect the first image in the directory.  A preview appears to the right.  If it is not one you want to delete, use the down arrow until you get to one you want to delete.\nGrab the column divider to the right of the preview.  Not the window edge, but the divider.  Drag it right as far as you can to make the preview bigger.  If you reach the window edge, keep going; the window edge will follow.\nWith the Command key pressed, click on the next image.  A preview of it will appear on top of the first one.  If it is not one you want to delete, with the Command key still pressed, click it again to de-select it.  Otherwise, leave it on the pile.\nKeep going down the column that way, for each image, either keeping it on the pile or deselecting it.\nWhen you get to the end, right-click (control-click) on one of the selected filenames and \"Move to Trash.\"  You could also drag it to trash, but there's a risk of accidentally letting go along the way and having the whole pile end up somewhere you don't want it.\nSecond:\nI have the program called GraphicConverter (GC).  If you want it, it is available from that link or from the app store.  I double-click an image, and GC opens it for editing.  If it is one I want to keep, I click the \"Next\" icon in the toolbar above the image. If I want to remove it, I use Cmd-A to select the entire image, and then Delete.  This changes the image to either transparent or all solid background color.  Then I click the \"Save and next icon.  Repeat until it cycles around to the image I started with.\nThen put the directory in icon view, select all the one-color images and delete them.\nThird:\nMake the window as big as possible.  Drag the slider in the lower left corner to make the images big enough to judge.  Select \"Sort by (anything)\" from the View menu.  (You need this because it brings back into the window the images that were moved out of sight by resizing.\nScroll down the window, deleting the ones you don't want.  If you find it unpleasant that they rearrange after each delete, you can instead use Cmd-click to have selections add to a collection and delete the whole collection later.\n", "Q: How can I tell if my Mac Wifi adapter supports \"ap mode\" First, a long preamble: I've got a set of smart plugs which I'm planning to flash with a new firmware using https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert. Long story short, this utility does over-the-air flashing of these devices with a new firmware. Very convenient and useful. List most smart home stuff, it seems, this is windows and linux only. This is not such a big problem in light of Docker and Docker Desktop for MacOS or Virtualbox, however the utility is failing with a complaint that my Wifi NIC (interface en1) does not support \"AP Mode\".\nHere's my question: how can I decisively tell whether my NIC supports (or does not support) AP mode? I've read that many (but not all) Mac NIC adapters may be lacking this feature, but am not sure how to tell using ifconfig whether this is the case. I can share my wifi connection, and I can sniff packets using WiFi on that mac, so this seems to me to indirectly indicate this is the case. But if not, I'll just get a USB dongle that will work and use that.\nBonus question: anyone recommend a MacOS compatible USB dongle that supports AP Mode in case my iMac does not natively do so?\n\nA: As far as I know all Macs sold within the last many years support AP mode.\nI doubt that your problem is that your WiFi card does not support AP mode, rather it is the fact that you're operating on a virtual network interface inside VirtualBox or Docker - and that doesn't allow exposing such features to the guest OS.\nInstead remove the WiFi interface from the host (i.e. it should not \"grab\" it over USB/PCIe or whatever - it should not load its drivers). Then expose it to the guest as a USB/PCIe device, and let it grab it.\n", "Q: Unable to place call from Mac using iPhone I have a Mac and and an iPhone. I want to make phone calls to my saved contacts from the Contacts app on my Mac without picking up my iPhone.\nBut when I click on the call icon in the Contacts app, Skype launches instead.\nCalling via iPhone was working fine previously, but now Skype launches instead. I do not wish to use Skype.\nI do not remember changing any settings, and I want the old behavior back to call from my iPhone and not from Skype installed on my Mac.\nHow can I resolve this issue?\n\nA: Apparently you installed Skype and it got configured as the default app for making telephone calls (default app your Mac would use to handle tel: links).\nYou can try to revert to the previous/default behavior by launching FaceTime app on your Mac, going to Preferences and opening the Settings tab. Look for the value selected for Default for calls: at the bottom and make sure FaceTime is selected.\n\n", "Q: Unable to install mac Big Sur beta 11.0.1 in Macbook pro 2020 'I am unable to install Big Sur beta 11.0.1.

Usually I just copy/paste successful actions I do on the command line into a text file. That's a bit of an error prone and cumbersome process and I sometimes forget to do it.\nDo you know of a way to automatically log commands that return successfully (I'm thinking of things like cmake, make etc. but also basic commands like cd) to a text file in order to keep a record of how you managed to finally successfully set up your environment to compile that one stubborn piece of code? For instance...\nI'm on a MacBook Pro, MacOS Catalina, using iTerm2 with zsh and oh-my-zsh extension, as well as powerlevel10k.\n\nA: \nDo you know of a way to automatically log commands that return successfully ... in order to keep a record of how you managed to finally successfully set up your environment to compile that one stubborn piece of code?\n\nYou first need to answer the question What constitutes a successful command?\nYou're probably thinking \"that's easy!  One that works and exits with a 0 code!\"  To get a better perspective of that, you need to define what a failed command is.  The broadest of definitions will be any command that has an exit code of not zero.  Does that mean the command has failed?\nNo.  It doesn't.  Commands fail for any number of reasons and that doesn't mean what you typed was in error.  Let's use a very simple example:  ssh.  If you connect to a remote server and exit cleanly (type exit when your done), you will get an exit status of zero (0).  However, if you poweroff the machine, you will get an exit status of one (1) when the connections is broken.\nDid your command fail?\nTry it.  Connect via SSH to any remote.  Exit cleanly then issue the command echo $?.  Do it again and then issue poweroff or kill your session on the remote and issue the echo command again.\nI also use Zsh and I created a custom prompt that prefaces my prompt with  a green check  or a \"red X\"  depending on whether the last command failed or not.\nHere's a sample with the SSH example used above.\n\n\nDid the command actually fail?  No, it didn't but the result generated an error code because something in the process failed.  This holds true for the commands you issue compiling software as well.  Your command can be syntactically perfect, but the compile will still fail because you have an error in your code. Did you want that command ignored?\nBASH_COMMAND Environment Variable\nOut of curiosity, I investigated this and it’s not a trivial thing to do.  You cannot use history because it’s designed to be interactive and not scripted.\nIn Bash, there is an environment varialbe called $BASH_COMMAND.  It’s the command that is about to be or is being executed unless the command was called from a Trap, then its the command executing at the time of the trap.\nIn order to make use of this, you would have to execute all of your commands within a DEBUG trap:\ntrap ‘prev_command=$thiscmd; thiscmd=$BASH_CMD’ DEBUG\nmycommand\nif $? -eq 0; echo $prev_command >> somefile.txt; else echo “Command failed”; fi\n\nThis would be the logic, but in all practicality, it doesn’t work because you have to execute your command within a trap.\nI haven’t found an equivalent in Zsh (yet... but I doubt I’ll continue my research).\nZsh Addons\n\nI'm on a MacBook Pro, MacOS Catalina, using iTerm2 with zsh and oh-my-zsh extension, as well as powerlevel10k.\n\nI'm not a fan of these things especially for the novice user.  You're bringing in lots of extra complexity and add-ons to prettify your command prompt and shell environment.  I encourage folks actually learn how to do this manually so you understand the underpinnings of your system.\nThe code for my above example is actually very simple:\nPROMPT=\"%(?.%F{green}✓.%F{red})%fallan@%m %F{blue}%1~ %f%# \"\n\nIn fact, I create a simple function (in ~/.zshrc or `~/.bash_profile) for when I have to cut/paste terminal output to public forums like this:\n# (Re)sets the prompt on the fly\nsetprompt() {\n\n  case \"$1\" in\n    se) # Obfuscates username to \"allan\" for StackExchange posts\n        PROMPT=\"%(?.%F{green}✓.%F{red})%fallan@%m %F{blue}%1~ %f%# \"\n        ;;\n    *)  # Default is to set the prompt back to the original\n        PROMPT=' %(?.%F{green}✓.%F{red})%f%n@%m %F{blue}%1~ %f%# '\n    ;;\n  esac\n}  \n\nBottom line, this really isn’t feasible.\nAvoid all those add-ons.  It's just wrapping.  Learn to use the core shell first, then add things as you go.  This will help you in actually learning the system.  You're looking for shortcuts to things and this will actually hinder your effectiveness.\nTL;DR\nDon't do this.  A command that failed isn't necessarily a bad command.  You can very easily \"ignore\" a perfectly good command because it failed due to an issue not related to the command itself.\n\nUsually I just copy/paste successful actions I do on the command line into a text file. That's a bit of an error prone and cumbersome process and I sometimes forget to do it.\n\nIf you're finding copy/pasting to be error prone, you're doing it wrong.  If it's cumbersome and you forget, then rethink your workflow.  I have OneNote open on my second monitor at all times so I can refer to and take notes as soon as I need to. Find a flow that works for you.  The built in shell history isn't a substitute for good note taking.\nNot only is this not a good practice overall, it’s not feasible at due to how you would go about capturing the last successful command.\n\nA: As user3439894 stated in the comment already, there is a history file recording all commands issued on the command line regardless of success or failure.  This list of commands is finite, however, and will toss off the oldest command after having issued a number of commands.  I have not checked, but I think on average that would be somewhere between 500-1000 commands (maybe more).\nWhether a command was successful or not is not stored beyond the last command given.  The exit code of the last command can be retrieved using the $? variable (non-zero is meant to indicate that an error occurred).\nThe reason this is not stored for longer is that in almost all cases it would not be useful.\nExample:\n\n*\n\n*You opened Terminal just now and find yourself in your home directory (typically indicated by a simple tilde ~).\n\n*Now you issue cd Downloads, which under normal circumstances shall be a successfully issued command.\n\n*Finding yourself in Downloads now, you can try to recall the last command by pressing the up-arrow key and hit Enter one more time.\n\n*However now, unless you manually created another directory called Downloads inside your Downloads directory, you will see that this time the command will fail.\n\nSo, in order to have a useful list of commands which were successfully issued, you would need to also record the environment, which includes the current path you were located in, the files which were available at the time you issued the command as well as their content and possibly other things I may have forgotten to list.\nYou therefore see that such a list is impossible to obtain or even worse to maintain.\nIf this is for you to learn how zsh works, it is better to look through manpages or online resources rather than tediously record successfully run commands along with their arguments in a text file as the next time you run them, they may no longer be successful or provide results you would not expect, effectively hampering your learning experience by confusing you.\n", "Q: Running Cron with an updated Bash version Is there a way to get cron to run with an updated version of Bash that's been installed?\nMy OS came with Bash 3.x installed stock and I've upgraded it to 5.x with macports.\nWhen I query bash --version from a terminal.app window the 5.x version is reported.\nIf I run the same query from within a cron job: * * * * * /temp/test_bash.sh >> /tmp/test_bash.log 2>&1 the 3.x version which came stock with the OS is reported.\nMacOS 10.10.5\n\nA: This should be easy to sort.\nFrom your shell, examine the full path of the bash you prefer\nwhich bash\n\nThen edit your script in tmp to call the same path to bash (or your script has to source in the dot files, but it’s custom to just make each item in cron know the full proper path and not depend on startup and login files as that is much more light weight for cron)\nI’ll end with one last link on good customs for cron environment being intentionally different than an interactive shell.\n\n*\n\n*Use cron to screencapture on Mountain Lion\n", "Q: Is there a way to stop macos from changing audio input when new device connects? As in the subject, I've searched for the answer to this online already, but found nothing. I am advanced user myself, but have not found any way to do this.\nThe gist - I have my preferred audio input device, which is a USB microphone. I also do have my preferred audio output device, which is wireless headphones. These headphones also have built-in mic. The issue is that whenever I connect my headphones (turn them on -> automatic connection via bluetooth), the audio devices on my mac automatically change. I am fine with automatic switching of audio output device, but audio input is annoying one is 100% of time after turning on my wireless headphones I need to open sound preferences and change input device to USB microphone. From what I observed, this happens for any new input device that connects to macos.\nThe question: Is there any way to disable automatic switching of audio input device whenever new one connects?\nPS: I have seen these Qs, but there is no acceptable answer:\n\n*\n\n*Set audio input/ouput device priority\n\n*Stop Automatically Switching to Bluetooth Audio\n\nA: I haven't tested it, but you could try creating an Aggregate device in Audio MIDI Setup.app that contains both your USB Mic and your Bluetooth headphones.\nThat way, the 'device' doesn't change when you connect your headphones: it's just a part of the existing selected device.\n\nA: This little app seems to do a good job forcing MacOS to use a given audio input and not switch: https://github.com/milgra/airpodssoundqualityfixer\n(Found on the related question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/438258/141873.)\n\nA: If you can’t figure a way to stop this entirely, here’s a quick tip to change input from the menu bar to recover without delay.\n\n*\n\n*Make the sound prefrences to show on your menu bar\n\n*Hold options keys while cliking on the icon to change the output or input device\n\nsource : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BFm0vP_Ys&ab_channel=9to5Mac\n\nA: No. This is the prescribed behavior as you've already noticed.\n\nI am fine with automatic switching of audio output device, but audio input...\n\nHow is the OS supposed to differentiate the difference between the one (device) you're OK with and the one you're not?  The way macOS sees this is that you've plugged in two distinct audio devices - input and output.  It then switches to them because  your Mac the assumes you want to use that device now as you've connected it; so it switches to it.\nA quick workaround would be to disconnect and reconnect your USB microphone after connecting your headset. You would probably have much better results if you connected the headset via cable to a USB DAC rather than Bluetooth. This way, audio always sees the USB as connected  whether or not a headset is connected - the auto switch won't engage.\nI do this with my Bluetooth Sennheiser headset (headphones and mic) effectively turning it into a headset only device.\n\nAudio Recording\nI'm adding this in here because the OP mentioned in comments that this was for an \"audio recording\" setup. This section will attempt to address issues in this context.\nYour Bluetooth headset is the wrong tool for the job.\nmacOS is designed to be (out of the box), something that you plug in an it goes to work.  I'm not saying it can't be used for audio recording.  What I'm saying is that it's architecture for the user to open the lid connect their things and start working.  This includes audio devices and the behavior you're seeing is that philosophy in action.  Why they chose not to do allow you to tweak it is entirely an Apple question.\nSo, whether Apple intended this behavior or not, you're using the wrong gear to record audio.\nBluetooth headsets are probably the worst thing you can do for audio recording/production.  You have inherent latency (radio signals are slower than electrical signals which travel the speed of light), the DAC inside the Bluetooth headset is nowhere as robust as the DACs of proper equipment and you don't get the necessary, granular, control necessary for proper audio recording. It's also prone to external interference, noise, and general signal quality issues.\nJust taking a very simple example - watch the evening news where they interview someone remotely and you can easily see the difference between someone with Airpods (as good as they are) and someone who spent a little bit extra on a proper microphone, a proper headset - and this is before we get into acoustic foam and mixers and gear!\nIf your goal is to record audio, you need a quality microphone and a quality interface (aka a mixer).  If you're just getting started, you don't need to spend buckets of cash to make this happen.  You can get a proper microphone input for under $50USD.  This will allow you to have a quality DAC, an input that you can control and a monitor port that will allow you to hear your input (your voice) before and after it goes through your Mac.\nAs you grow and add instruments or more voices to your recordings, your equipment should grow along with you.\nBottom Line\nA Bluetooth headset is designed for listening or making phone calls.  Can you do recordings with it?  Sure.  However, it's not designed for it and it will show.  You need the right gear for the job: a quality microphone and a proper interface to capture and/or output that sound.  Short of that, and the quality of your final product will suffer.\n", "Q: How to boot into recovery mode on Catalina?

In the mean time make sure all your data / backups are current. When you’re ready, you will want to get an external drive and erase the drive completely (not just erasing a volume, but complete erase per this page)\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496\nMany people will select Macintosh HD and erase it, rather than erasing the container, so be sure you follow the “How to erase your disk” part and not “How to erase a volume on your disk” portion.\nThen run the installer to install on the blank drive - once that is done, you can hold the option key to test things boot, migrate data in from backup and make the call if and when you do the erase on the internal drive.\n\nIf you wanted to try a half measure, delete any old installers you have (including stand alone bootable installers) and get a copy of Catalina fresh from the App Store and run that installer one time. It might fix the built in recovery partition, but I really don’t like messing with things at this point. Yes, we could fix your one issue - but it shouldn’t have broken and what else might be broken as well that you don’t know about. Better to erase IMO.\n", "Q: How to convert photos from heic into jpg? On ios devices photos are stored in heic. I turned on the option to \"send originals\", so when I send a photo from my phone to my mac, it is in heic format.

For my own purposes I'd like to stick to the more efficient heic-format.\nWhat ways are there to convert photos heic to jpg on macos?

According to the docs, when a conversion is deleted, \"all of the messages in a conversation will be deleted\".\nSomehow, when I delete a conversation, sent emails are not deleted which creates orphans in the \"Sent\" folder.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: These are two totally different entities.\nThe confusion comes in from a misunderstanding of how messaging works.  It' helps to understand the concepts:\n\n*\n\n*Your Inbox are what you received via your incoming server\n\n*\"Conversations\" is a collation of related messages you've received by your email client.  There's no conversation the server is aware of.\n\n*Sent Messages are messages that were transmitted via your outgoing server\n\nWhat's important to know is that as far as your server is concerned, there's no such thing as a \"conversation.\"  There are just messages in folder (Inbox, Outbox, Sent, Junk, etc.).\n\"Deleting the conversation\" is nothing more than a feature that was implemented to help organize your Inbox.\n", "Q: First time iPhone user here, some of my App icons on my Home Screen sometimes “blink” (turn to grey for a second), whats the meaning of it? i've just got my first iPhone (7), and i'm kinda new to the iOS and everything, but today i've noticed something that i'm not exactly sure what it was, but it seemed like some of my App's icons on my homescreen blinked/flickered (turned grey) for just a sec in a random order, then went immediately back to normal, is there any info on what happened?\n\nA: The app likely updated. When the app update is installing, the app is temporarily unavailable.\nAlternatively, iOS may be cleaning the app. If your device is running low on space, iOS may delete temporary/cache data from the app’s container. This will temporarily make the app unavailable, for a couple seconds and show ‘Cleaning…’ in place of the app name.\n", "Q: Working with two screens Sometimes I connect my MacBook to my TV to watch a movie. I don't use screen mirroring, but have the TV arranged above the Display of the MacBook. Dragging a window with the touchpad to the TV screen is easy enough, but I don't like the user experience. Is there a way to manage my windows with key combinations? Thus, is there a key combination to move a window from one screen to another?\nIf I could arrange windows between screens with Mission Control that would also be great; but as far as I can tell Mission Control is limited to the current screen. Thus, I found no way of moving a window from one screen to another using Mission Control.\nAlso I would like the Dock to always stay on my MacBook Display. Usually it does, but often enough it vanishes only to appear on my TV screen. Is there a way to control this on macOS Mojave 10.14.6?\n\nA: The dock will stay on the primary display if you disable 'Displays have separate Spaces' in Mission Control prefs. This will also enable all the settings below to work seamlessly, rather than fighting with what Spaces you have frontmost on each display.\nIf you use VLC for playback - which I'd highly recommend as being a) free, b) really easy to use but c) with lots of really complex options if you really need them -  you can set it to open in its own fullscreen method, which ignores the macOS native fullscreen, which otherwise will automatically black out the other screen. You can also dictate which display to open the playlist & the playback video on.\nThis means you can use the laptop screen for your playlist & the TV for the movie.\nThere's a lot you can do if you juggle these options. It's worth a few minutes messing with them to see what suits you. [You usually need to re-launch it for these to kick in.]\n\nSet as above will hide the playlist as you start playback. Disabling the first option will allow you to keep them separate if you want. Disabling native fullscreen stops the OS from blacking one display [unless you specifically enable it on the right] & making a new Space [both of which I find infuriating… yet another reason I never use Apple's fullscreen.]\nIf you're using this setup for movie playback, I think this will remove any need to be dragging windows from screen to screen at all.\nSet & forget.\nThe only downside I've ever found with VLC is that it forgets your current playlist if you quit/relaunch/reboot. It will remember current playback position inside any one file, once you reload your playlist, but not which was playing. It's not like most Mac apps in that respect.  For everything else, it pretty much 'just works'.\n\nA: I like to keep it simple and avoid third party window managers. They exist and do precisely whatever you want, easily set up to be controlled by key shortcuts, but in this case I close the lid and watch the movie in closed clamshell mode, zoom the window to full screen.\nThe mission control key shortcuts can also yet you set up a second display on the TV so you can have one layout for the normal windows and switch to a second layout for movie time.

Most are Thunderbolt 3 though there are a few that are only USB with Alternate Mode display.    So, when you go from that USB-C port to HDMI, you're converting the signals.  That signal may stay high because the conversion isn't \"clean.\"  This is why I always recommend using an active adapter that will recreate the signal versus a passive one that just \"rearranges the signals.\"   I believe that will sort your issue as well.\nHowever, on a DisplayPort input on a monitor, there's no conversion - the signal is clean.  So, when you turn it off, it's off.  If you can use DisplayPort, then I recommend that over HDMI There's no conversion and it's a better signal.\nWhat you're seeing is just one of the many idiosyncrasies of HDMI.

The work laptop is kind of secondary currently. For personal use, I just use the Macbook Air.\nWhat I would like is to be able to hook up EITHER my Macbook Air (for personal use) OR my Macbook Pro (for work use) and use the laptops as the main 'hubs', linked to two large displays for both from the iMac and the Thunderbolt Display, so that I can transport my stuff easily to/from the office if I need to (where I can hook into another display at work). I don't need the laptop screen to be visible but the main aim is to have two large displays linked to either laptop I need to use.\nIs this possible with my Macbook Air and 2 large displays? Is this possible with my Macbook Pro and 2 large displays?\nCurrently, I have the following cables (excluding the power supplies):\n\n*\n\n*To link the Thunderbolt to the iMac, I have a cable that comes out of the display and splits into two: a Thunderbolt connector and a MagSafe 2 connector. I use this with the iMac currently.\n\n*I also have a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter which I can use to link the Pro to the Thunderbolt Display. Could I get something that would allow me to link the iMac to it too?\n\n\n*\n\n*What additional cables do I need to purchase?\n\n*Can I chain the Thunderbolt Display to the iMac to the Macbook Air, or is it not possible to have two screens with the Air as it only has one Thunderbolt port?\n\nThank you so much for help in advance!\n\nA: Your question(s) are answered in this existing post:\nWhat are the requirements to use iMac screen as a second monitor - Target Display Mode?\n\nWhat I would like is to be able to hook up EITHER my Macbook Air (for personal use) OR my Macbook Pro (for work use) and use the laptops as the main 'hubs', linked to two large displays for both from the iMac and the Thunderbolt Display, so that I can transport my stuff easily to/from the office if I need to (where I can hook into another display at work).\n\nLaptops are not \"hubs\" of any kind so, it's not clear what you're attempting to do here.  If you're attempting to sync all your work/personal things between the laptop and the desktop, then it's a different topic altogether (a different question) and easily solved with a Cloud service (OneDrive, iCloud Drive, etc.)\nAs for the cables - what you want to do is really not feasible.  First off, you are limited to Thunderbolt because that's what the 2013 iMac requires.  However, each notebook has a severe limitation to accomplishing what you want to do.  Let's look at them individually and not as a part of a larger puzzle:\n\n*\n\n*2013 MacBook Air\n\n*\n\n*Single Thunderbolt port / only supports one external display\n\n*To get a second display, you'll need a USB Video Adapter (it's like installing a second video card in a desktop machine)\n\n\n\n*2020 MacBook Pro\n\n*\n\n*No longer supported for Target Display Mode to the iMac\n\n\n\nSo, right out of the gate, your MBA can't support the two displays and while your MacBook Pro supports up to 2 external displays it can't support your iMac as a second display (see the above link about Target Display Mode).\nSo, to connect your MacBook Air to either the iMac or the Thunderbolt Display, your need a Thunderbolt Cable.  That's assuming it's the older Thunderbolt Display.  If it's the new LG Ultra Fine, you'll need a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 1/2 (Legacy) Adapter.  However, it's probably \"too much\" monitor for that legacy MacBook Air - it'll work poorly.\nAs for your MacBook Pro, if it's the older Thunderbolt Display, you'll need the same thing as your MBA - the Thunderbolt Legacy Adapter and the Thunderbolt Cable.  If it's the new UltraFine Thunderbolt Display, you'll need a quality Thunderbolt 3 Active Cable.\nTL;DR\nYou can't do what you're asking.  The MBA only supports one display and while the MBP supports 2 external displays, it no longer supports Target Display Mode meaning, in this scenario, it only supports one display.  You might get the MBA to support two displays with another USB Video Adapter, but it will put a hurt on performance as USB is not an ideal interface for video.\nMy suggestion is to focus on your workflow to ensure all of your data is where you want it to be so that you can use any device, where ever you happen to be, and be assured that your data is intact.\n", "Q: Mac Mini 2018 (w/T2) Ignores Cmd-R, Option, and anything else on reboot I have a 2018-era Mac Mini (Macmini8,1) running Catalina 10.15.7.\nI am unable to get the system to recognize any commands I hold down during system reset. I have tried both my existing wireless keyboard (Microsoft with a USB dongle) and a plug-in USB keyboard. Regardless, if I hold down Option during boot, I get no menu. If I hold down Command-R, I get no Recovery mode. If I hold down Command-Option-P-R I do not get the behavior that indicates the NVRAM has been zapped. In all cases, I boot directly into the normal OS and log-in screen.\nI did try the command line technique, but this did not solve the problem I'm after, as it's not possible to adjust the System Security Tools when you do it this way. :-(\nAdvice welcome--thanks!\n\nA: I'd try an Apple keyboard.\nOne of my Mac Pros has a Logitech Windows keyboard, which it completely ignores if I want to do diagnostics.

There also seems to be no way to view or control these file associations, nor any long-press → \"Open with...\" type of action.\nAnyone got any insight into this maddening behavior?\n\nA: You can select the app to open your file by long pressing your file.

I'm using macOS 10.13.6 and 101 windows keyboard. Each time I press Fn + F5 together I can play/pause my vlc player.\nI'm trying to make it easier by lock Fn key so that I need to press just F5 itself to play/pause.\nper a post\n\"system preferences>keyboard and mouse>keyboard\" can lock Fn key.\n\nHowever, no matter I check that option or not, I have to press Fn key and F5 key together to play/pause my vlc player.\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: A windows keyboard will not necessarily send the same Fn combinations as a Mac keyboard. One way to test the Preference itself is switching is to listen for the error beep. When you press [actual] F3 in Finder, it should error beep, because it has no assigned function. The alternate Special Function should invoke Exposé, moving all your windows out so you can see them all. Whether you hold Fn to invoke this depends on which way that pref is set. The pref switches immediately as you check/uncheck it, you don't even need to close the window.\nIf it still beeps on both settings, the keyboard is likely sending the wrong message.\nIt's hard to tell what message the special function keys send because they're combined in the keyboard & acted upon before anything else in the computer can read them.\nTry Key Codes (freeware) from the App Store & test to see what shows when you press F1 and Fn/F1. The 'true' F-key will show a true code, the Special Function version will show nothing, it will just do the special function. If that's not what you see in KeyCodes, then you can be fairly sure your keyboard is not sending something the Mac can act on.\n", "Q: (10.15.7) From where can the Quartz image filters be accessed? I stumbled upon the Quartz image filters when I was building a Quick Action in Automator.  From within Automator, I was able to preview the image filters, and some of them are actually pretty cool.  I'm aware that the PDF Quartz filters can be applied via exporting an existing PDF opened in Preview, however this is not true of the image filters.  Oddly enough, they aren't available in ColorSync Utility either, even though the PDF filters are.  A few of them appear in Photo Booth.  Beyond Automator workflows, is there anywhere else that these filters can be accessed?\n\nA: Firstly, I think you mean Quartz Filters, not XQuartz. Quartz is the graphics subsystem in macOS, XQuartz is an X11 (unix GUI) environment for macOS ('X11 on quartz').\nThere are two types of Quartz Filters: 'Quartz Filters' and 'Quartz Composition Filters'.\nQuartz Filters are normally found in /System/Library/Filters. They should be accessible in ColorSync Utility, under the Filters pane of the toolbar.\nThe following are the system installed filters in that folder:\nBlack & White.qfilter\nBlue Tone.qfilter\nCreate Generic PDFX-3 Document.qfilter\nGray Tone.qfilter\nLightness Decrease.qfilter\nLightness Increase.qfilter\nReduce File Size.qfilter\nSepia Tone.qfilter\n\nYou may have other filters installed in either /Library/Filters or <user>/Library/Filters.\nHowever, it's likely that you're talking about Quartz Composition Filters, which provide a range of manipulations to images. The Automator action to apply Quartz Composition Filters states:\n\nThis\naction can use any Quartz Composition of type Image Filter installed\nin the Quartz Composer Composition Repository (“/Library/Compositions”\nor “~/Library/Compositions”) as long as it does not depend on time.\n\nThe system-bundled filters are in /System/Library/Compositions. They include things like Blur, Mask, Mirror, and other effects.\nAs for where they can be accessed: the answer is 'not many places'. (Yet again Preview fails to be a flagship/showcase for the impressive features of the underlying architecture.)\nYou can of course create a droplet Application with Automator that will show the Action at runtime, allowing you to select and define the filter each time. (You may want to duplicate the image beforehand.)\nThese things are called Quartz Composition Filters because they were created in Quartz Composer, a developer tool for processing graphical data. However, this has been deprecated in Catalina, so it will not be developed further and may be removed from the OS at some later point.\n", "Q: How can I get the Finder to show metadata? I am running MacOS Mojave 10.14.6 on an iMac. Sometime last July, the Finder started hiding the metadata of downloaded photos. Its behavior varied for a while, but now it seems to have settled down to the following.\nI open a pic -- e.g., https://fs3.fotoload.ru/f/0220/1580572066/e367aaa0e2.jpg -- in a browser window and drag it to the Desktop. The Finder's Get Info shows this:\n\nI open a Column-view Finder window for the Desktop, with all the Image Preview Options enabled, and select the pic. I get this:\n\nI drag the pic to a folder, which is also in Column view. The metadata appears briefly (< 1 sec), then changes to this:\n\nGet Info shows only this:\n\nThat's also what I get if I drag the pic directly from the browser to the destination folder.\nIf I open the pic in Preview, it shows the metadata. What can I do to get the Finder to act like it used to and always show the metadata? I have installed no Finder extensions or photo management software.\n\nA: Under the View menu, there is an item \"Preview Options\". This allows you to specify what data will be shown in the Preview pane.\nThis item (and the various parameters it contains) may only be available when you the Preview panel is showing and you have an image file selected.\nThese are the defaults:\n\n", "Q: suspect message \"sshd-keygen-wrapper would like to receive keystrokes from any application\" I am receiving this message about \"sshd-keygen-wrapper would like to receive keystrokes from any application\", here is a screenshot:\n\nI find it suspicious... this binary is located at /usr/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper and never had this message before. the closest to a solution that I found is that it is harmless... does anybody know a bit more about it?\n(disclaimer: I am using a MacOS, and this relates mainly with unix / linux software - so after some thoughts, I thought it was more apporiate to post it here than on another forum.)\n\nA: I assume you have just enabled SSH logins for you Mac - if not, I would find it suspicious too!\nWhen you enable SSH logins, the system needs to generate a host key. The host key is needed for clients to be able to verify that they're logging on to the same computer each and every time they connect. This works the same way as on Linux and other Unix-type systems.\nIn order to generate a host key, the SSH software needs a lot of good, random numbers. An common input source in generating random numbers is sampling keyboard input (amongst other things). This is why it requests access to receive keystrokes.\nYou could give it access, generate the key and revoke the access immediately.\nYou could also generate the SSH host key via other means or on a different machine, and securely transfer it to this Mac. This way you won't have to grant access. The host key is stored in the /etc/ssh/ folder.\nPlease note that you should not just copy over the host key already in use by another computer - this would defeat the purpose of the key!\n\nA: This happens when you run something (apps/binaries/scripts etc.) needing Accessibility Permissions while in an SSH session on that machine.\nYou can reproduce this in the following way:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to remove sshd-keygen-wrapper from the Accessibility list so it is allowed to ask again for permissions\n\n*\n\n*\n\n\n\n*ssh localhost to SSH into your own machine\n\n*Run something requiring Accessibility Permissions\n\nHere in my example I'm running the hotkey utility skhd to generate an F11 event.\n\nSo, if you're not connecting to your Mac through SSH, better check if you have SSH open without a password. Apple calls it Remote Login in System Preferences -> Sharing.\nThe only other way this could happen is if someone else logged in through SSH on your computer.\n", "Q: Am I being hacked?

Then I can drag the cell border down to fill the column with increasing consecutive dates.\nIs it possible to do this with calendar months? A rough approximation would be to set each cell to be \"cell above plus 30,\" but this would give a different date each month. I want to be able to fill cells with the same date each calendar month. In other words, if a cell contains \"7/11/20\" I'd like to be able to drag the cell border down to automatically fill the next cell with \"7/12/20\".\n\nA: You can try formula and get easily what you are looking for.\nEDate, starting row and month =1 (which increase the month when you scroll it)\n\nFINAL RESULT WILL BE:\n\n", "Q: iOS 14: daily automation not running I have set up a simple automation to run a Shortcut at 6am every morning.

Depending on what automation you do, you may need to have it run in the HomeKit controller so it triggers from a device that is running and cleared for background tasks.\nYou can certainly report it to Apple as a bug, but everything I see from power management, automations are designed to be user triggered or relevant to the device in a near term sleep state, not that it wakes itself up and runs work in the background.\nI would expect it to run once you wake the device after 6 am, though. That would be worth a bug if the task never triggers.\nI’ve had an automation run each day for a week, so I’m not so sure this is a bug at all in iOS 14.\n\n\nA: Whatever was stopping this from working has gone away - it’s started working without me changing anything \n", "Q: Can one access all application data when given physical access to an iPhone? An answer on SO to a question on whether or not you could access stuff in the cache of Mobile Safari, stated that no, this was not possible, as each app runs in its own sandbox. I am unsure how this really answers the question on whether you can access the application, as even if each application lives in its own sandbox, not being able to access stuff on the outer filesystem, it might be that there is a way to access stuff in the sandbox from the outside. For instance, a VM lives inside of a sandbox, but one could still mount the filesystem in the VM from outside of the VM.\nWe make an app that makes use of a WKWebView and I would like to know whether caching images locally on the phone would enable an attacker to gain access to those images or if there are mechanisms built into iOS that prevents anyone with physical access to the device from getting to them.\nI know that a lot of stuff is possible if a device is jailbroken, but there might be other ways as well?\n\nA: The sandbox protects data from app A from being accessed by app B, it doesn't protect data against the OS or any OS-level access. And as has already been mentioned in the comments: Once an attacker gets physical access to a device, all bets are off anyway.\nIf you want to specifically protect data items you need to add encryption within your app to handle this.\n", "Q: Default browser in Google maps on iPhone iPhone recently allowed me to set Chrome as the default browser, but this has not affected browsing from google maps.

The SATA cable connecting your SSD to the Mac is intermittently failing. This is a common problem in MBPs of that vintage.\nThe good news is that this means the data itself on the drive is ok, and the internal cable just needs replacing. Alternatively, you could get an external USB enclosure (a box with a USB cable), and put the SSD in there. You may want to get a repair shop to do this.\n2. The drive itself has failed in some way.\nIf this is case, then it is very unlikely that your data can be recovered.\nBackups of data are essential to prevent data loss from drive failure.

I'm using iOS 13.\n\nA: It's Icloud , Icloud cached installed app permission data.\nTurn off the Icloud Sync and then reinstall app.\n\nA: App permissions are stored somehow by the system, not the app itself.

I see, for example, that the Microsoft User Data folder is not being synchronised because it is ineligible.  That shows with a struck-through cloud icon.  And I don't see this Microsoft folder appearing on my iPhone.\nApple documentation says that ineligible folders are usually because there is not enough iCloud storage for the element.  That does not seem to be the case with my Microsoft User Data folder as it is only 40 Ko and I have nearly 1 GB available on my iCloud space. To me, it seems that behaviour is specific to the Microsoft directory.\nHow can I replicate that behaviour to another folder?

I have a stereo audio file that has two mics and when one person speaks it plays in one cup of my headphones and when the other speaks it plays in the other cup. Is there a way to \"center\" this audio so it plays out of both cups rather than just the one?\n\nA: First, make sure you have a stereo project (timeline), unless you are dealing with 5.1 (surround) files:\n\nSelect the clip, and at the property inspector set it to dual mono:\n\nNow both tracks will play at both channels.\nBy doing that you will also enable breaking apart clip itens (command+shift+G):\n\nTracks are now independent from the video.\n\nYou can manually map each one for whatever speaker you want.\n\nJust remember you can't break apart all the channels before setting them to mono. If they are grouped you will just detach it from the video.\nAlso, expanding the audio tracks (option+control+s) won't do pretty much anything regarding channels, it is just a tool for visual aid and some editing purposes.\n", "Q: How to \"securely\" erase my MacBook's SSD I would like to sell my Macbook Pro, but I want to make sure that there is no way to retrieve the deleted data from my SSD.\nIs there a way to completely delete all files on a hard drive so that even a forensic expert cannot recover anything?\n\nA: You don't need to.\nOnce you erase an SSD on  a Mac, it's unrecoverable even from a forensics standpoint.  This is because of the type of TRIM command that the hardware (SATA controller on the logic board and the SSD) issues.  Basically, if you were to stop an erase mid-process you theoretically could take it to a lab or the manufacturer to recover data.  So, it's not impossible but highly, highly improbable recovery is possible. I've previously written about this topic:\n\n*\n\n*Can the data on an MacBook Pro SSD be recovered after formatting using Disk Utility\n\n*How to get the \"securely erase\" function of Disk Utility on El Capitan & Sierra\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/288756/119271\n\n*Recovering files from SSD and SSD life?\nIf you want to be even more certain, turn on File Vault (Apple recommends this) when you reset it.  Then disable it (for the next user).\n\nA: Yes\nYou can boot into the recovery mode and then erase your hard drive. By turning on security options when erasing the drive, it will overwrite the drive completely multiple times, which will make it nearly impossible to read any data again.\nThere is a good guide about how to prepare your Mac before selling it, which can be found here. Only thing to add is to enable security options when deleting - as mentioned by the answer from @IconDaemon this is not possible on SSDs.\nEven the Apple support page has a clear guide on what to do.\nNote: It took me one search with the keywords erase mac hard drive for sale to find this article at the top.\n\nA: Because you have a SSD installed in your MBP, you cannot use the 'secure erase', nor the 'erase free space' options in Disk Utility. It is better to boot your MBP into macOS Recovery while your SSD is protected with FileVault, then wipe the drive and reinstall macOS.\nFrom this post at Backblaze are instructions on how you can also use Terminal commands whilst in macOS Recovery to do the secure erase you're looking for:\nSecurely Erasing Free Space on Your SSD\n\nIf you don’t want to take Apple’s word for it, if you’re not using FileVault, or if you just want to, there is a way to securely erase free space on your SSD. It’s a little more involved but it works.\n\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty, let me state for the record that this really isn’t necessary to do, which is why Apple’s made it so hard to do. But if you’re set on it, you’ll need to use Apple’s Terminal app. Terminal provides you with command line interface access to the OS X operating system. Terminal lives in the Utilities folder, but you can access Terminal from the Mac’s Recovery System, as well. Once your Mac has booted into the Recovery partition, click the Utilities menu and select Terminal to launch it.\n\n\nFrom a Terminal command line, type:\n\ndiskutil secureErase freespace VALUE /Volumes/DRIVE\n\nThat tells your Mac to securely erase the free space on your SSD. You’ll need to change VALUE to a number between 0 and 4. 0 is a single-pass run of zeroes; 1 is a single-pass run of random numbers; 2 is a 7-pass erase; 3 is a 35-pass erase; and 4 is a 3-pass erase. DRIVE should be changed to the name of your hard drive. To run a 7-pass erase of your SSD drive in “JohnB-Macbook”, you would enter the following:\n\ndiskutil secureErase freespace 2 /Volumes/JohnB-Macbook\n\nAnd remember, if you used a space in the name of your Mac’s hard drive, you need to insert a leading backslash before the space. For example, to run a 35-pass erase on a hard drive called “Macintosh HD” you enter the following:\n\ndiskutil secureErase freespace 3 /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD\n\nSomething to remember is that the more extensive the erase procedure, the longer it will take.\n\n", "Q: How create a crontab on mac?

Since all bandwidth is used I can't update it manually, so I didn't try.\n\n\n*Auto App-Update, checked and it is already set to not auto update over Cellular and Wi-Fi.\nAfter all these steps, the problem is still not solved. So I reset my iPhone deleting all data.\nThen I restored all data from iTunes Backup and tried to download all apps and it took a huge time and lot of data because something is running in background. So I paused some of apps from downloading and then cancelled the download of these big apps like Apple Office Apps, Google Office Apps and MS Office Apps and GarageBand.\nI had a lot of photos and some files in the Files app in On my iPhone part and not in iCloud Drive.\nMy iCloud drive and iCloud backup is always turned off.\n\nThen I deleted all my Apps to check if any app is doing it.\nFirst WhatsApp and then every other non-apple apps + Watch app and Translate app.\nIt didn't work.\nOn 3rd November, I deleted all the files in my On my iPhone in Files app and deleted all my photos.\n\nNow the phone, despite having nothing, is still using all the Wi-Fi bandwidth.\nThere is no way to check the Wi-Fi usage from iPhone.

If I leave my computer alone for some 1-2 hours, I don't know exactly how long, it tries to logout. But I have terminal programs running (CLI tools fetching data from FTP, or doing processing of some kind, etc.), so the computer never fully logs out. I don't want it to logout though, I want it to stay logged in. It's also quitting the browser and my text editor, which I don't want it to do.\nWhat settings do I change? In System Preferences, I clicked \"Start after: Never\". I put Energy Saver to never sleep with or without battery.

The only thing I can do is to wait or kill them when I get impatient. Is there any way to inspect what these programs are doing, e.g. reading/writing files, system calls, waiting for something, etc.?\n\nA: Why yes you can inspect running programs. It’s technical, but very doable.\nOpen up the Activity Monitor and look for the program you see hanging. Select it with the mouse / pointer. Then click the gear and rather than forcing it to quit, choose System Diagnosis...\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/activity-monitor/quit-a-process-actmntr1002/10.14/mac/10.15\nYou should be presented with a pretty lengthy Privacy Notice, which I recommend everyone read and make screen capture if you want to read later. Then let the process run. It first gathers all the time-sensitive information about that specific process - what it’s doing, what memory it has asked for, what files and network connections it may have, then this tool packages all manner of very detailed information about just about everything on the system. Logs, errors, file systems, network setup, etc...\nThe main items to look at are the samples - and if this is something you wish to do often, you can even get Xcode which has an “instruments” app that attaches to running processes to look in to them and determine why they hang.\n", "Q: How can I make sure texts from friends with iPhones don't go to iMessage instead of my Android phone? I have always used an Android phone, but text messages from certain friends get hijacked by iMessage. How do I prevent iPhones and MacOS Messages from sending me iMessages? I need all messages to be SMS or MMS.\nSome friends with iPhones will text me, but I don't receive the message. Today I noticed the Message app on my Mac had notifications. I never open this app since I don't use iMessage, but I looked today, and found multiple \"lost\" messages from several weeks ago.\nPlease note that this is NOT the same question as Removing phone number from iMessage. My Android phone is not, and has never been, registered with iMessage, and I have already followed those instructions. Another poster (cpcallen) had the same question as me--How can I ensure that friends with iPhones send me SMS/text instead of iMessages?--but it was closed, being deemed as the same as the Removing phone number question. It's actually fairly different.\nI have tried:\n\n*\n\n*Leaving my Messages app closed on my Mac. But somehow messages from these people get hijacked.\n\n*Deregistering my mobile number using Apple's online Deregister iMessage tool. When I attempted this, I got the message \"Your phone number is not registered with iMessage.\"\n\n*Finding a setting on my Android phone that addresses this. The\nproblem is apparently (and logically seems to be) on the Apple end.\n\nThings cpcallen says he tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Closing Messages.app. I still get macOS notifications of messages.\n\n*In Messages > Preferences… > Accounts > [my email address], untick \"Enable this account\". Then my friends messages disappear and I never\nsee them at all, at least until I reenable in Messages.app.\n\n*Looking in System Preferences and on icloud.com and appleid.apple.com    to see if there is some setting I can disable—but\nI've not found    anything relevant.\n\n*Using Apple's Deregister iMessage tool to unregister my mobile    number. When I attempted this it gave me the message \"Your phone\nnumber is not registered with iMessage.\"\n\n\n\nA: You can not control how the sending phone addresses messaging much from your phone. As you mentioned, you have already deregistered your cell phone from Apple serves so that leads to the conclusion that your contacts are sending to your AppleID, by their choice.\nYour only lever on the receive side is to change your AppleID to something no one knows. Then, you won’t have incoming iMessage transmissions by email or by mobile.\n\n*\n\n*It’s likely not practical to get everyone to change their address book to clear their contact database to suit your preference, each time they make a mistake sending to your AppleID.\n\n*It’s also equally impractical to just block them entirely on Apple devices and hope they change the way they communicate.\n\nBut it never hurts to ask nicely, maybe people would change up their conversations instead of reusing the old conversation that is easy rather than checking the “to” closely.\n", "Q: No timezones for any location I cannot set any timezone on my Mac.

Not just nice for me to be able to exercise during meetings, also nice for my girlfriend who would get a ripped nerd as BF.\nDoes anyone have an idea of where I should start to look in to this? All the googling I have tried to find a starting point have rendered nothing as it is getting mixed up with kind of \"How to use video in a google meeting\"\nAll help is appreciated!\n\nA: Not a direct answer, since I don't know GoogleMeet, but if you're using Zoom or WebEx, just record yourself through your webcam then use that video as your virtual background. Just be sure to make the video long enough so it loops well.\n\nA: I would suggest installing OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) from this web site:\nhttps://obsproject.com/\nIt allows you to create content in a variety of ways, including green screens, etc. In your case it is just a simply video you want playing.\nIf you have the very latest version of OBS a virtual camera plugin is included with the software. If you have an older version, you can download and install the same OBS Virtual Cam plugin from here:\nhttps://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam\nWhen installed you'll have a VirtualCam option in the Tools menu in OBS, where you can start a virtual camera.\nFinally in Google Meet select the virtual camera as your camera. Now the output from OBS is transmitted to meeting partners in Google Meet - and from OBS you can control whether the video is a pre-recorded file, your actual web camera, or something entirely else (like a still photo or similar).\n", "Q: Guarantee/force remote shutdown Situation: a mac running 10.14, accessed from a Windows laptop via TeamViewer remote desktop software.\nProblem: sometimes apps will prevent shutdown. \"Xcode interrupted shutdown\" or similar. Once every 1-3 weeks.\nBecause the TeamViewer app on the mac quits successfully — terminating the network connection before the \"$app interrupted shutdown\" message is shown — I never see this message myself and only know about it because coworkers with physical access report it to me when I ask for their help.\nWhen the mac fails to shut down, the automatic boot-up the next morning also never runs, therefore the TeamViewer app on the mac never re-opens, therefore I can't connect to it remotely the next day.\nQuestion: Is there some way to force the mac to shutdown, no matter what state it is in, even when apps interrupt the process?\n(Software solutions only — while a timer switch that periodically cuts power would work, I don't want to risk physical damage from regular power interruptions).\n\nA: Have you tried to execute shutdown from Terminal:\nsudo shutdown -h 2011032000 \"Shutting down at 8:00pm tonight\"\n\nYou can specify the precise time, using the yymmddhhmm format, and using a 24-hour clock for the time.\nAt least it doesn't ask me to quit or save any running program. It will simply quit anything running in.\nYou can make automator script to execute too if this helps for your requirement.\n\nA: Power Manager\nPower Manager can be used to remotely shut down a Mac. You can do this to a schedule or on-demand through a secure remote connection.\nApplications that traditionally block log out are not a problem for Power Manager. Power Manager works through a series of steps to safely shut down a Mac; these steps are:\n\n*\n\n*Running applications are sent a friendly quit request.\n\n*Running applications are given time to quit.\n\n*If an application has not quit in time, the application is force quit.\n\n*With all the applications quit, the user is logged out.\n\n*Once all the users are logged out, Power Manager then asks macOS to shut down.\n\nI am an engineer working on Power Manager, so feel free to ask technical questions or get in touch via the company's support e-mail address.\n\nA: I cannot test this with TeamViewer, but I managed to get it to work over Apple Remote Desktop. I was connected to a Mac I could also physically watch whilst I was doing this remotely.\nI did it all via the GUI for best emulation of what may happen over Teamviewer.\nYou need the Fast User Switching menu item enabled on the remote Mac - System Prefs > Users & Groups > Login Options\nSwitch to another admin user. Sign in.\nFrom the Apple menu, select Shut Down [I used Restart for convenience but I'm sure there's no real difference]\nThe following message appears…\n\nRestarting my cause other users logged into this computer to lose unsaved changes\n\n\nEnter your admin credentials & hit Restart/Shut Down as appropriate.\nThis will [seemingly gracefully] 'force' quit any app that demands an answer before it would normally quit.\nI tested with a Photoshop document with unsaved changes. This is normally guaranteed to prevent Shut Down. There was no noticeable delay at all, the Mac shut down as though everything had just quit as normal.\nNote: The unsaved changes were indeed lost after reboot.\n", "Q: How to disable Safari's Frequently Visited blacklist on macOS?

Before I stored anything on it, space was 1TB, after storing around some files of around 2GBs, things were okay. But once I removed those files from the SSD, it still occupies that 2GBs of space.\nSo, can anyone explain:-\n\n*\n\n*Why these 2GBs of space was still showing even after the files were removed? Also, can we factory reset the device?\n\n\n*Also, the format it is using is ExFAT, does Mac uses it by default or it depends on the SSD?\nThe other ones are listed in the below screenshot:-\n\n\nA: I am not sure if I completely understand what you're asking, but I'll try to answer your questions:\n\ncan we factory reset the device?\n\nIf you are talking about the SSD, then there is something like a factory reset. It is called formatting and you can do it in the disk-utility app (pre-installed on macOS)\nYou can follow Apple's guide or this guide. In short, I recommend formatting in MacOS Extended and using the GUID table, but I am no expert whatsoever.\nThis process will delete all files on the drive.\n\nAlso, the format it is using is ExFAT, does Mac uses it by default or\nit depends on the SSD? The other ones are listed in the below\nscreenshot\n\nExFat is a format type. Formatting types are mentioned in the second article. In short, ExFat can be read from both windows and Mac, yet it doesn't always play nicely with Mac and may eventually lead to compatibility issues. Therefore, I would not recommend it, also because with compatability software like Paragon you can read MacOS Extended drives in Windows.\n\nA: \nWhy these 2GBs of space was still showing even after the files were removed? Also, can we factory reset the device?\n\nThere can be many things that cause that space to appear used like not emptying the trash, the utility you used, how you formatted it, etc.  I need to see what you did to give you a good answer.\nDrives don't have a factory reset like a phone  but you can erase them very easily with a tool like Disk Utility.\n\nAlso, the format it is using is ExFAT, does Mac uses it by default or it depends on the SSD?\n\nThere is no format that's dependent on an SSD. APFS is made for SSDs but one SSD isn't going to work with one format while another won't.  ExFAT is just an option; there is really no default. You have to define what you want. If you want to share this device with Windows and Linux, then ExFAT is good. If not, JHFS+ or APFS are perfectly fine too.\n", "Q: Safari reuses already existing tabs instead of opening new ones If I click a link in say an e-mail or application and that exact link already has an open tab, Safari will focus that tab instead of opening it anew at the end of the current window.\nI would prefer this behaviour to be different because moving the focus is really distracting and often I want the new tab to open in the current window/context.\nIs there a way to change this?\n\nA: In Safari Preferences -> Tabs -> Check the box for \"⌘-click opens a link in a new tab\".  Then use ⌘-click to force it to open a new tab in Safari when clicking the same URL domain.\n", "Q: Can someone install a keylogger on a non-Jailbroken iPhone? I personally myself never had an iPhone all my life except I once owned an iPod touch back in 2012 for a couple of months but I am still a tech savvy person and I know the JailBreak process and Android rooting. But here goes my question and its a very simple one.\nCan someone install a Keylogger on an iPhone which is not-Jailbroken and its running in its default factory state regardless if its iPhone 6 or iPhone 12 and regardless of whatever iOS version its running inside it? I personally read some Quora forum questions and many people were denying that iPhone is so secure that no kind of keylogger can be inserted/installed and hidden if that iPhone isn't \"JailBroken\". They were implying like the following quote from one of the guy replying to the question.\nAs long as your iPhone is not rooted you are safe (most likely the case).\nThe only other way someone can “hack” your iPhone is by going in through iCloud. Just make sure 2 factor authentication is turned on. Maybe change your password too and you’re good to go!\nI’ve made keyloggers for Windows/Android/etc.…. it just can’t be done on iPhone without jailbreaking.\nSo I want the experts here to confirm if whatever this guy is saying, is true that iPhones are one of the most secure platforms in the world and no one can spy on it by merely installing a 3rd party keylogger app to spy on the owner of that phone unless and except if that iPhone is successfully jailbroken and definitely APPLE itself can see our data which is not a concern for me. My only concern is that no other 3rd person like someone from friends and family, can do a keylogging trick on someone's Locked non-jailbroken iPhone.\nThank you. Awaiting replies.\n\nA: Yes, but only with the Apple ID & password.\nThis makes it really a parental tool on a child's account rather than a general threat to regular users.\nThere's a list here of some of the better-known loggers, but most are jailbreak only, the others need AppleID details.\nhttps://janetcpatterson.medium.com/top-10-best-keyloggers-for-ios-771d85b2d330\n", "Q: List and define SMB shares from command-line In MacOS, is it possible to list and/or define SMB shares at the command-line?\nOn a Linux machine with Samba, I can use the testparm command and the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.\nOn Windows it would be the net share ... command.\nOn Mac, I only know the \"System Preferences\" > \"Sharing\" GUI.

Who knows.  You have to do proper diagnostics to determine what is wrong.  Simply looking at something is just guessing.\n\nCould replacing keyboard backlight flex fix my keyboard problem?\n\nPossibly, if it is what's causing the issue.\nYou have to test the cables - that means checking continuity and resistance on each pin.  It can also be the keyboard controller.  It can be any number of things and only putting hands-on and doing actual diagnostics can you be certain.\nIt's understandable that you want some more certainty than guessing, but unless it's blatantly obvious like the cable is burnt or cut, nobody can simply look at a picture of an electrical component and tell you proof positive that it's the failure point.

There already exists a worldwide standard for connecting tripods—1/4-20 UNC  screw—to cameras (the hole you see at the bottom of any camera made in the last few decades).\nThis is a silly little question, but somebody needs to ask it.\nAre the MagSafe magnets in the iPhone 12 series strong enough to reliably hold the phone, only through magnets, to a tripod?\nOtherwise it seems like an obvious contraption, one that enables users to use one of their existing tripods rather than acquire a tripod specifically for just this edition of this phone. (If you found such a contraption and have experience with it, please share.)\nUpdate\nWe are unlikely to ever get even a hint from Apple that the magnets are strong enough for snapping to gadgets attached to a tripod or to ones attached to car vents, for the simple reason that Apple would be setting themselves up for yet-another frivolous class-action lawsuit, even if they used Neodymium magnets in the iPhone 12—especially with the still-fresh memory of the last outlandish MagSafe lawsuit. (After many years of use, I can attest that a MagSafe cable is much safer when perpendicular to a MacBook, because it snaps off much more easily when pulled, yet the lawsuit succeeded in proving exactly the opposite.)\nIn this question I'm soliciting anecdotal evidence that the magnets are usable for snapping on/off by a careful user (who of course takes his/her own risks).\nUpdate 2\nQuite likely this is a lot more handy for attaching the iPhone 12 to car vents, with the convenience of one-handed snapping on and off everytime you step in/out of the car, and the reduced risk of the phone falling only a short distance, likely on a carpet.\nUpdate 3\nApple was not the first to bring to market (i)Phone magnetic cases and attachments with the MagSafe line.\nMoft and MagBak also have offerings, possibly preceding Apple's.\nIt's still unclear whether anyone released a camera tripod magnetic attachment, or a car vent magnetic attachment.\nOther options:\n\n*\n\n*Peak Design\n\n*Manfrotto\n\nA: \nAre the MagSafe magnets in the iPhone 12 series strong enough to reliably hold the phone, only through magnets, to a tripod?\n\nMagsafe is for charging not mounting; it helps align the charger.  Even if they are strong enough to hold the phone, are you willing to put a $700USD (or more) device hanging by just a magnet?  You use the 1/4\" or 3/8\" screw posts to securely hold camera gear with proper mounts (hot/cold shoe), why would you risk your phone this way?\n\nOtherwise it seems like an obvious contraption, one that enables users to use one of their existing tripods rather than acquire a tripod specifically for just this edition of this phone.\n\nI don't see what MagSafe has to do with a tripod in any way.  You didn't need MagSafe to use your phone with a tripod before MagSafe.  I literally just purchased this Manfrotto Mount (see below) to hold my iPhone on a tripod and additional 1/4\" posts to attach LED panels.\n\n", "Q: Time Machine thinks the size of my backup is bigger than the source I have a new MacBookPro 16\" with a 500Gb SSD. Currently it has 332Gb of files on it.\nI'm trying to run the first Time Machine backup, and it keeps failing because there's \"not enough space\".\nBy default, it estimates a full backup to be 674Gb.\n\nEven if I exclude the entire source drive, it reckons it will take 353Gb.\n\nBoth drives show no errors when analysed with Disk Utility. Anybody know what might be going on?\n\nA: I eventually resolved this, though I'm not sure exactly what the issue was. Steps I took:\n\n*\n\n*Wiped and reinstalled the OS using a SuperDuper backup.\n\n*Initially, Time Machine then showed the 'correct' size estimate, but then quickly changed to the incorrect version again. At this point, it was also showing me a phantom Time Machine backup drive that I couldn't remove.\n\n*Now suspecting some corrupted settings, I switched to my admin account. Having wiped my SuperDuper backup to use as a Time Machine drive again, I tried to set up Time Machine there instead. Here, I could remove the phantom drive, and the size estimates looked correct.\n\n*I switched back to my user account, and added back my TM exclusion folders. Everything still looked good.\n\n*First backup completed successfully \\o/\n\nIt's possible trying to sort things out in the admin account may have worked in the first place, without the full reinstall. I guess we'll never know...\n", "Q: How can I troubleshoot bluetooth occasionally restarting on MacBooks? During the last 4 years I've had 3 different MacBooks (one personal, two from different jobs) that had the same issue: bluetooth randomly dropped all connections. I typically have a bluetooth keyboard, mouse and headphones connected but headphones are typically optional.\nIf it happened with one machine, I would blame myself for messing something up or maybe faulty hardware in that particular unit. However, this is my third macbook that's suffering from the exact same issue. Bluetooth either comes back after a few minutes or I restart the thing manually. It's a bit annoying during conference calls.\nIs this by any means a known issue and something I could do anything about?\n\nA: I have never experienced such an issue on any of my Macs. I haven't heard others complain about it either.\nAs far as I understand, you're saying that Bluetooth stops working for a few minutes every once in a while - even with only a keyboard and a mouse connected - and it happens often enough that you're impacted even within a single conference calls.\nI would try using wired devices and only having a single Bluetooth connected device. Try different combinations to see if you can single out a faulty device.\nIf that doesn't help, try going to other locations and see if the problems goes away. You might be dealing with interference from a noise source, which have affected all 3 Macs in the same way.\n", "Q: Slow HEIC Viewing on Mac When viewing HEIC images with QuickLook from Finder on my MacBook Pro (2019) there is always a slight delay of almost a second. Other formats (jpg/png) work just fine.\nWhen viewing the images in Photos they show up instantly.\nCan this be fixed?\n\nA: Since I found no fix I wrote a small app that uses macOS components to display the HEIC instantly.\n\nA: Another possibility is using a third-party app such as ApolloOne. I have tried and succeeded in skimming through 50 HEIC files in just a couple of seconds. In contrast, QuickLook took nearly a whole second to view each individual HEIC file.\n", "Q: Google Authenticator after an iphone motherboard replacement A little while back my iPhone X started having motherboard issues and was unable to be booted up.\nI was using Google Authenticator to store many accounts, some of which may be impossible to get to without those codes.\nFrom what I understand Google Authenticator is tied to your hardware, and as a result when I restored my icloud backup to a new phone, the Google Authenticator keys are lost.\nThis leaves me no choice but to try to get the old iPhone working so I can safely restore an iCloud backup to it and have the google authenticator codes appear again. If it’s the same phone this will work fine.\nThe question is:\nIf the phones motherboard is replaced, does that effectively change the hardware so much that google authenticator won’t recognize it as being the same phone?\n\nA: Google Authenticator stores your accounts in the iOS Keychain. There's nothing special about the way this is done - it is the same as with other apps on the iPhone.\nWhen you restore an unencrypted backup, these types of Keychain entries are not included in the backup - and thus cannot be restored. It does not matter if it is restored to the same \"motherboard\".\nIf you instead make an encrypted backup (including iCloud backup) and restore from that, your Keychain entries will be restored - and thus your Google Authenticator accounts.\nThis is entirely intentional from Google, and they have set up the app exactly to do this. If it weren't setup that way, your accounts could be compromised without having the \"second factor protection\".\nThe mechanism through which the backup is “linked” to the actual device is entirely implemented by Apple - there’s nothing Google Authenticator-specific about it. The data is encrypted using the Secure Enclave’s unique is as part of the encryption key. The Secure Enclave is a special component of the processor on the iPhone that allows, amongst other things, encryption/decryption of data based on a unique ID that cannot leave the Secure Enclave.\nThis means that it is not possible to just read out the unique id to perform the decryption somewhere else. In practice this means that the data can only be restored on that physical device (I.e. the device having the same Secure Enclave as when the backup was made).\nI know it is too late for you now, but when setting up 2FA accounts, you really want to set up at least 2 devices, so that you have a backup device in case one is lost for any reason.\nIf the services you use do not support having multiple 2FA codes, I would suggest instead using a different Authenticator app that allow syncing the secret behind the 2FA code between devices. The free Authy app from Twilio is a very popular choice.\n", "Q: Is it possible to livestream the screen of an iPad? I have been looking for a way to livestream the screen of my iPad to Discord or some similar service so friends can watch but I haven't been able to find any clear info if this kind of thing is even possible, let alone which apps support it. Discord and Twitch seem to not support it in their apps at least.\nI know Airplay is for streaming to TVs but this doesn't seem to be useful for me. Is this possible to do? My first preference would be streaming to Discord but alternatives would be good as well.\n\nA: Yes. Engage screen recording and you will see which apps allow you to stream from that app. Also, Airplay to an AppleTV or video out often can be sent to an HDMI capture card.\nTo try this you could use Zoom or WebEx or TeamViewer or Microsoft Teams. We pay for and use the last two at work widely, but I believe all of them let you try and use the app for non-commercial uses after registration.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935\nAlso, the squirrels are awesome. Check out if you broadcast from a computer and share your iPad to it. Amazing things are possible for sharing now from iOS 14.\n", "Q: How to reset screen time app limit in iPhone? I have screen time limit set up for Social apps with a passcode. After allowing an app to be used for the rest of the day, if I change my mind afterwards how can I lock that app again besides waiting until the next day?\nI have tried disable screen time and enable it again. Also tried to change the passcode. Nothing works, the app stays unlocked no matter what I tried.\n\nA: As far as I know, you can't do that because you have approved the application for that day... So you can't switch the app restriction back for this day, you must wait for tomorrow.\nBut instead of \"allow app for the rest of the day\" when the time limit has been reached, you can simply cancel the time limit for this app in the settings...\nIf you still want to have the screen time limit again afterwards, you simply have to reactivate the app limit in the settings and then the app can't be called again, when the preset screen time is reached (even if it is switched off and on again, it remembers the time used).\nHowever, that is not the point of the thing (screen-time-limit-app), but fulfills your purpose!\n", "Q: Time in GMT or Missing Time Zones in systemsetup The problem\nMacBook Pro (Catalina 10.15.7) decided to start showing GMT in the status bar and system preferences last week. It is physically in Pacific time (PST) and I'd like it to show that time instead.\nTroubleshooting thus far\nFollowing Apple instructions\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Date & Time:\n\n*\n\n*\"Set date and time automatically\" is turned on using Apple Americas/U.S. (time.apple.com.)

Maybe this is \"where it gets good\".)\n\n*\n\n*date returns the correct (local) time\n\n*systemsetup gettimezone returns GMT\n\n*systemsetup listtimezones returns Time Zones: and nothing else\n\n*systemsetup settimezone America/Los_Angeles returns America/Los_Angeles is not a valid timezone\nDid the timezone list somehow go missing? Can I add it manually? Is there an update I can run to re-link this somehow?\nI'd like to resolve this without an OS re-install if I can. Help me Ask Different, you're my only hope.\n\nA: I was experiencing this same problem after updating to 10.15.7. The fix for me was copying the old /private/var/db/timezone/tz/2020a.1.0/icutz/ictuz44l.dat to the new /private/var/db/timezone/tz/2020d.1.0/icutz directory. Make sure you backup the 2020d.1.0 version before replacing. After the copy is complete, restart the timed service.\nThe new version must have been corrupted somehow.\n\nA: I didn’t have to “fix anything” so this isn’t super satisfying as an answer, but the problem has resolved itself. I see no updates that would have affected this and took no further action.\n\nA: I waited about a week, but the issue persisted. I began to have issues with Calendar.app wherein some events were reported correctly (but in GMT) and some events were reported incorrectly (as if my timezone was restored to Eastern Time).\nMy most recent tz folder was 2021a.1.0:\n# ls -rt /private/var/db/timezone/tz/ | tail -n 1\n2021a.1.0\n\nMy next most recent tz folder was:\n# ls -rt /private/var/db/timezone/tz/ | tail -n 2 | head -n 1\n2020f.1.0\n\nFollowing @armiller's suggestion, I was able to fix my Mac by running this in Terminal.app:\nbroken=$(ls -rt /private/var/db/timezone/tz/ | tail -n 1)\nprevious=$(ls -rt /private/var/db/timezone/tz/ | tail -n 2 | head -n 1)\n\ncd /private/var/db/timezone/tz\n\nsudo mv $broken/icutz/icutz44l.dat $broken/icutz/icutz44l.dat.bak\nsudo cp $previous/icutz/icutz44l.dat $broken/icutz/icutz44l.dat\n\nI then opened the Timezone selector in System Preferences. Now the timezone is set to a real value. My Calendar uses the correct time. Unfortunately, the clock in the menu bar was still wrong. Restarting the OS fixed the clock in the menu bar.\n\nA: 2022 Update - I faced a similar issue today on my M1 Max MacBook Pro on macOS Ventura 13.0.1. When I logged in, the time displayed was suddenly in GMT and when I tried to change this through Settings > General > Date & Time the settings pane for adjusting the Date and Time would not open!\nI tried to call Apple Support but their solution was to reinstall the OS (duh!). When that did not help me, Google let me to this thread. Similar to @justmydisplayname systemsetup listtimezones returned Time Zones: and nothing else for me too.\nI had another iMac running macOS Ventura 13.0.1 which I used as the donor for the icutz44l.dat file. However, when I tried some of the commands above, I kept getting Operation not permitted error. To get around this, I had to reboot into recovery mode, mount my drive using Disk Utility and then use the terminal to overwrite the icutz44l.dat file.\nOnce I had done this, things went back to normal. The clock was showing time in my timezone and the Date & Time pane was working as expected again. Thanks everyone for your tips.\n", "Q: Set default music app Can I change the default music app on OS X? When I accidentally press the play/pause button on my headset it opens the Music app (formerly part of iTunes), which I never use or plan to use ever.\nI will be super happy to map that button to mute/unmute the system audio, but that could be a long shot.\nI would be satisfied by setting my default app to VLC, so at least I can use the button to play and pause the music on my favorite app.\nAs a last option, I'd settle for disabling that functionality, so at least accidental presses don't fire up a nagging app on top of my work forcing me to close it.\n\nA: How to change default music app on macOS:\nRight-click on your audio file (mine is mp3), and select 'Get Info'\n\nDropdown 'Open With'\n\nSelect your desired app, from the app chooser (I chose VLC)\n\nThen, click on 'Change All'. What it will do is when you open the mp3 file, it will open in VLC. So you will have to do the steps again with an m4a or wav or ogg files.\n\nNow if you open the app, it will run in VLC!\n\nYouTube video to change default music/audio app\n\nA: There's an app called NoTunes. It's a background service that will stop the Music app from launching and allows you to set up an alternative app if needed.\nSince it's a background service, it would consume some energy.\nIt's not perfect, but it works.\n", "Q: Neighbor's Airplay device is sometimes visible in Airplay menu I need help understanding why I'm sometimes able to see my neighbor's Airplay-enabled device (a smart TV or Apple TV, I don't know) when wireless and (I think) Bluetooth is enabled on my Macbook Pro and Airplay is \"looking for TV\".  If I regularly click the Airplay icon in the menu bar, I might see this device about 1 out of 40 times or so.  If I leave the menu open when this device is listed, it will disappear in a few seconds.\nIf I try to connect to this device, the system says that the wireless signal is too weak.\nI'm definitely on my wireless network.  The signal strength of my neighbor's WiFi is 3 out of 4 \"bars\", so I can at least see that their network is available, but it has a lock icon and I've never tried to connect to it.\nI'm 100% certain that this device is not on my wireless network.\nBasically, I want to understand why I see my neighbor's Airplay device from the list of devices I can connect to.\n\nA: Airplay devices can be discovered in two ways:\nThe most obvious is using Bonjour on the local network, you're connected to. It is basically a kind of broadcast DNS lookup that allows devices on the same local network to find each other.\nThe not-so-obvious method, which is what you're experiencing, is through peer-to-peer Airplay. This works by devices discovery through low-energy Bluetooth. If you choose to connect to such a device, the devices communicate through Bluetooth to setup a direct device-to-device WiFi connection. This type of connection does not use your local access point / router or your internet connection - it is direct communication between the two units.\nIt is fully possible that the signal conditions are so that you can discover the device through Bluetooth, but it is not possible to get a good enough signal to establish the device-to-device WiFi link.\n", "Q: iOS Disregards Airplane Mode Setting on Reboot I’m using an iPhone 11 Pro on iOS 14, but I have also observed this behavior on iOS 13 as well as on an iPad running iOS 14.\nSometimes, when I go to reboot my phone I will close all apps (just to cleanup the app drawer, I’m not trying to manage what’s running myself) and then put the phone into airplane mode so that it will be in airplane mode when it eventually reboots.\nWhat I’ve noticed is that about half the time, after closing all apps and putting the phone into airplane mode, when the phone reboots, LTE is active, wifi is not connected, and the last few apps that I closed are in the app switcher. If I do it again, it works as expected. I also notice that if I wait for 30-60 seconds after closing everything, and then reboot, I almost never see this behavior.\nThis is more of a curiosity than anything but I wanted to see if there was a reason for this? Does iOS not immediately store the open apps and airplane mode status when set?\nThanks!\n\nA: This is by design.\nI've tested this on several iOS devices of various iOS versions (iOS 9, 13, 14 and iPadOS 14) and all do the same thing.\nI haven't found anything that specifically says so, but it makes sense so that if it's ever lost/stolen while in Airplane mode (WiFi/Bluetooth/Cellular off) when it comes back on after a period of time, it will automatically turn things on to be able to be found.\nIf you turn off WiFi individually, you get a message that it's \"disconnecting from WiFi for 24 hours,\" not permanently. This is obviously to get you connected again in case you forget or the phone is lost or stolen.\nIt falls into a design philosophy of \"fail secure\" meaning if everything fails, it will fall back to a config that will allows you to find it and/or wipe it.\n", "Q: Does the \"powermetrics\" command line tool come pre installed on mac?

If I update safari from the app store it will update to the latest release version (~14).\nHow can I install a specific version of Safari on the iPad?\n\nA: The version of Safari browser is tied to the version of iPadOS running on your iPad. It's not possible to pick and install a specific version of Safari which is lower than the current latest version of iPadOS.\nIf you wish to use a specific version for development and testing, you can install Xcode on your Mac, which would give you access to iOS/iPadOS simulators running on macOS.\nThereafter you can pick and download a specific older version of iPadOS (such as iPadOS 13.1).\nThe only con is that instead of Safari running on a real iPad device, you'd be testing on a software simulator of Safari for iPad running atop a desktop/laptop computer.\n", "Q: Transfer private MP3 files from my PC to my iPhone SE 2020 tl;dr: I want to add my own .mp3 files (and audiobook etc.) to my iPhone SE 2020.

I certainly know this was not there before,I don’t know how long it has been in supervision for but I’ve only now seen it. I looked up how to remove the supervision and I was told to factory reset my iPad so I tried but it is telling me that there was an “error connecting to the Apple ID server”.

It can't be easily undone/removed.  The reseller, or possibly the org who returned the device, will have to release it from MDM via Apple Business Manager, at which point you'll have to erase/reinstall iOS or possibly use DFU mode if that option is locked.\nAfter that, during set up you will not be prompted for MDM enrollment, and it should be free from any management.\nUntil this is done, any number of operations can be remotely performed on the device by the organization or person managing the MDM instance (e.g. locking it, pushing settings, etc.).\n", "Q: How to add image to file format .mp3 on a Mac?

Is there anything similar for Outlook?\n\nA: \nIs there a way to install outlook custom add-ins in Mac from terminal without requiring manually installation.\n\nYes.  From Microsoft Documentation:\nSideload Office Add-ins on iPad and Mac for testing\nFor side loading the add-on in Office for Mac, you need to save/copy the manifest file to the wef folder. If the folder doesn't exist, you must create it.\n\n*\n\n*Word: /Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Documents/wef\n\n\n*Excel: /Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/Documents/wef\n\n\n*PowerPoint: /Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Powerpoint/Data/Documents/wef\n\nA: The add-ins for Outlook are saved in a different way than add-ins for Word, Excel and PowerPoint. When you install a custom add-in from a manifest, the only thing actually installed is the manifest file, which is placed in a subfolder in:\n/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Outlook/Data/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/16.0/Wef/\n\nThe actual folder name depends on the installed version of Outlook. For example on my installation, the subfolder is named:\n{7C3F43ED-AE0C-944A-A24C-7600FF485918}/5mwIVoCDw1ZTUJCywA2uyg==/Manifests/\n\nThe manifest.xml file is renamed to the value of the  tag and the value of the  tag inside the manifest - like this:\n  <uuid>_<version>\n\nFor example if your manifest includes this:\n<Id>EC13B9A0-5BA2-676A-956B-C583BDC94D5E</Id>\n<Version>1.1</Version>\n\nIt would be named like this:\nec13b9a0-5ba2-676a-956b-c583bdc94d5e_1.1.0.0\n\nUnfortunately just adding your file to the directory is not enough to fully install the add-in. The next time you open Outlook, the add-in will actually be installed and show up in the ribbon - but after a short while, Outlook will discover that it is not supposed to be there, and it removes the add-in again. Including deleting the file from the file system.\nThis indicates to me that the installation of the add-in is registered with Microsoft's servers - the same way as when you add an add-in from a URL.\n", "Q: QuickTime - Record internal audio and not external audio My goal is to record my screen with internal audio, but leaving out external audio.

OK, I want to look at my calendar and know when I will be paid. I normally use Apple's Calendar, but I also have access to Microsoft Outlook.\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*I'm paid every month;\n\n*I'm paid always on the last possible day before the 28th day of the month;\n\n*I'm paid always on a working day.\n\nTherefore, notwithstanding the bank holidays (public holidays in the UK):\nI should always be paid on the 27th, except when it's on a Saturday or Sunday, in which case I'm paid on the previous Friday.\nIt's pretty simple, really, but for some reason that looks impossible on my calendar:\n\nThe options for recurring are.. [[first to fifth]|last] [day|weekday|weekend day|[a day of the week]] and nothing else. I cannot specify it must be before the 28th. I can tell it to recur every 27th, but it will be wrong two or three times in a year.\nThen I remembered there's a bunch of calendars that can be synchronised online, like webcal.fi, and I read about it and they use a small file format called iCalendar, with extension .ics, but I can't figure out how to make complex recurrence rules. I thought \"how do they calculate the recurrence of easter, for example?\" and proceeded to look for it. Alas, all the iCal references for easter I found are a bunch of hard-coded dates for each year, no logic involved.\nThus.. my question: Is there any way I can set this event recurrence up? Can it be done? How?\nThank you!\n\nA: No.  You can't create a recurrence for this granular of a rule set.\n\n*\n\n*I'm paid every month;\n\n*I'm paid always on the last possible day before the 28th day of the month;\n\n*I'm paid always on a working day.\n\nSo, to simplify it, you're paid the 27th of every month unless it's a weekend or holiday, then you're paid the previous workday.\nYour options are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Schedule a year or two of a monthly recurrences for the 27th then go through the next 12/24 entries and manually fix the ones that fall on a weekend or holiday.  This is probably the quickest and most effective method because you can quickly scan your calendar for conflicts.\nUsing the calendar below, you can find only 3 instances where the 27th falls on a weekend in less than 30 seconds.  Easter being a 4th entry is also simple to modify.  It's simply not efficient to code these one-offs.\n\n\n*Create a CSV (Excel) file of your pay periods and convert them to .ics.\nYou're finding hard coded calendars with no logic because it's far easier to make the single change manually than to write the logic for it.  Your payroll admin also processes these anomalous events manually.  The problem with trying to automate this is...\n\n*\n\n*holiday events vary too much from culture to culture\n\n*holiday events in calendars aren't \"calculated;\"  they're event entries like every other event entry (team meeting, dentist appointment, parent/teacher conference, etc.)\n\n*holiday events are not all equal.  Not all banks/companies will observe all holidays (close).\n\nYou could create the code using an opensource ics library to generate the .ics files your particular organization, but you're not going to find this recurrence pattern available in the calendar apps.\n\n\n", "Q: Change default indent size in mail.app My mail.app seems to default to a barbaric 8-space indent-size.

And checking my backup data on my iPhone there doesn't seem to be an option for Notes.\n\nA: I'm sorry to say this but I think your note is permanently deleted.\nHere's why: \nDeleting text in a note is like deleting text in a Word-document. When you delete all text in a Word-document, you can still undo (using CMD+Z) while the document is open. If you closed the document, the undo history gets deleted. And I thinks iOS Notes works this way. Try to create a new Note, add some text, go back, exit the app (by swiping up) and open it again. Can you undo(shake the device) to remove text? No. Undo history is gone.\n\nA: You may be able to recover the Notes on your Mac using the Local Snapshots.

I'd create the directory from Terminal while setting it hidden with SetFile, applying ACL's to prevent any modifications while also removing all normal privileges (rwx), all in the hope that Apple doesn't mess with it until the next upgrade.\nThat said, if your are the type that always shows all files including the hidden ones, then what's mentioned in the paragraph above is a moot point.\n\nNotes:\nTo boot to macOS Recovery from a running occurrence, normal mode boot, of macOS, you can use the following compound command from Terminal:\nsudo nvram \"recovery-boot-mode=unused\"; sleep 2; sudo reboot\n\nThen before rebooting from macOS Recovery, in Terminal from the Utilities menu, run:\nnvram -d recovery-boot-mode\n\nThe latter is not necessary in some versions of macOS, however, it doesn't hurt either way.\n", "Q: Why is my MacBook going to sleep when it's configured not to?

To treat the line as a comment, you have to start the line with a comment character.\nBash Reference Manual (Chapter 3.1.3) - Comments\n\nIn a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the interactive_comments option to the shopt builtin is enabled (see The Shopt Builtin), a word beginning with ‘#’ causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored. An interactive shell without the interactive_comments option enabled does not allow comments. The interactive_comments option is on by default in interactive shells.\n\n$ shopt -s interactive_comments          <-------- Enable interactive_comments\n$ shopt -u interactive_comments          <-------- Disable\n\nTo make this permanent, put the command in your ~/bash_profile or ~/bashrc.  It's enabled by default in Bash\nZsh Reference Manual (Chapter 6.7) - Comments\n\nIn non-interactive shells, or in interactive shells with the INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS option set, a word beginning with the third character of the histchars parameter (‘#’ by default) causes that word and all the following characters up to a newline to be ignored\n\n% setopt interactive_comments         <------ Enable interactive_comments\n% unsetopt interactive_comments       <------ Disable\n\nTo make the setting permanent, place the appropriate command in  your ~/.zshrc.  It's disabled by default in Zsh.\n\nA: All Cmd. does is sending CtrlC to the shell running in the current Terminal tab/window.\n\nSo you can get the same effect in iTerm2 by just typing CtrlC.\n\n", "Q: No longer receiving iMessages from an iCloud email address I have just got a new (2020) iPhone SE, and having an issue with iMessages.\nI was previously in a group conversation - most of the recipients are phone numbers (with iPhones), but one is an iCloud email address.

Everyone else in group chat can see our messages fine.\nWhat's going on here? I've tried turning imessages on and off. Any other tips?\n\nA: If another iCloud account can’t see your messages, it could be as simple as they have blocked you. It could be more complicated that Apple thinks they blocked you so they would have to work with Apple support, but you can’t really tell what’s happening to someone else’s iCloud account by design.\nIf you send them a message that’s about all you can know was Apple accepted it from your device.\n", "Q: Is /Users/Shared preserved after reinstalling the OS?

When I click on a PDF link in Safari, it opens using Preview. At the bottom of the PDF file, there are controls buttons (see here https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/safari/ibrw1090/mac). When I click on \"Save on your Mac\" control button, it is saved on my Downloads folder. I would like to specify the location when saving the PDFs. One solution I found was to use command+s when viewing the PDF. This solution does not work all the time, namely, if I am not viewing the PDF using the actual PDF URL, e.g., https://blablabla..../pdf.pdf. This happens for example in the IEEE Explorer when viewing PDFs. When using command+s in a PDF in IEEE Explorer I download the website (.webarchive file) instead of the PDF (.pdf file).\nWhat I would like to do is to be able to save PDFs in specific locations in my MAC. Is it possible using Preview in Safari? If not, probably using another software will solve the issue, so how can I open PDFs in Safari using different software? I looked for solutions on the internet but I am not able to find a solution. Thanks.\n\nA: Are you viewing the PDF using Safari's default PDF reader and using Command+S keyboard shortcut within Safari? Or are you pressing the Open with Preview option in the control box (as in the Apple support article you linked), which loads it in Preview, where you can then save wherever you want?\nIf you are pressing the Save on your Mac option within Safari's PDF reader, then by default it saves to the ~/Downloads folder, unless you have chosen to change the Downloads folder to a designated file path/folder yourself? You can change this within Safari's General preferences tab, but remember any other file you download will also download to this designated download folder. This might be useful if you're bulk downloading PDFs all at once to the same folder.\nThe alternative is, when you are viewing a PDF within Safari, you can select File>Export as a PDF from the menubar which should then prompt you with a save dialog box.\nAnother alternative is, before clicking on a PDF link on a website/search result, you can right click and select Download Linked File As which will then prompt you with a save dialog box. It's a bit tricky to know if the link is a PDF but if the URL ends with .pdf then typically it will load using the PDF reader within Safari and download as a proper PDF. In Google Search results there's also a little symbol indicating it's a PDF (highlighted in my image below).\n\nFinally you can use other PDF readers with their own Safari PDF reader plugin which may prompt you with the save dialog box when you press download, but I am not sure about this. From memory, I believe Adobe Acrobat did do this several years ago, but overall I found the experience using Adobe Acrobat PDF reader within Safari a bit slow and clunky, so I reverted back to Safari's default PDF reader.\nLet me know if this helps!\n", "Q: How to find all folders that are larger than 1GB or 10GB on the Mac HD?

Since svg is scalable without resolution loss, it might be a solution. Is it possible to capture a screenshot as svg format? I'm running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6\n\nA: The built-in utility used by macOS to take screen shots does not support the SVG file type. It supports raster graphics, even saved as a PDF it's an encapsulated raster graphic image in a PDF document wrapper.\nAs an example, using https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/mac.svg, here is what the contents of the file looks like:\n<svg viewBox='0 0 90 100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>\n  <path d='M62,0c2,10-9,24-20,24c-3-14,9-22,20-24M5,36c5-8,13-12,21-12c7,0,12,4,19,4c6,0,10-4,19-4c6,0,14,3,19,10c-16,4-15,35,3,39c-7,17-18,27-24,27c-7,0-8-5-17-5c-9,0-11,5-17,5c-7-1-13-7-17-13c-9-10-15-40-6-51' fill='#AAA'/>\n</svg>\n\nIn Safari it appears as  as:\n\nIn order to have it scalable, it needs to be in the code format shown above and viewed by an application that understands it, and can translate the code into an image for viewing, etc.\n\nA: In principle, anything in macOS that you can print, you can save as a PDF. Just use the PDF pull-down in the bottom-left of the print dialog.\nThese PDFs are actually vector based, so they are scalable like you describe. You could use one of the many tools to convert this PDF to SVG, but this is not guaranteed to work perfectly.

My iPhone has thousands of photos. I'd like to store them in iCloud Photos, to help me migrate to a new iPhone with less storage.\nI've set it up, following the section in the iPhone User Guide and the Set up and use iCloud Photos support document.\nLooking at my photos in a web browser at icloud.com/photos, it seems my iPhone has only uploaded some of my photos. I can only see about my last 6 months of photos there, but I have many more on my phone.\nThe documentation I've linked to above is extremely minimal for a complicated feature like this, and doesn't seem to help.\nHow can I tell the status of the iCloud Photos upload process on my iOS 14 iPhone?\n\nA: On your iPhone, in the Photos app, at the bottom, select the Library tab. Then select All Photos.\nThen swipe upwards.  This should reveal some hidden information about the status of the iCloud Photos upload, which I've highlighted with a red box in this screenshot:\n\nHere, this uncovers that the iPhone has paused the upload, to save battery power. I'm not sure if it warns you about this - perhaps it doesn't, or do you eg have a kid that might have dismissed an alert without telling you?\nIf you press the blue Resume \"button\" / link, it'll continue uploading.\nThe iCloud Photos support document does have a hint about this in the (literally) small print. Emphasis is mine:\n\nYour collection is uploaded to iCloud each time your device connects to Wi-Fi and your battery is charged. When you have iOS 11 or later, your library can be updated over mobile data also.\n\nIf you've spent a long time trying to figure this out before finding this information, don't blame yourself. In my opinion, this is an example of poor design from Apple - this feature has low discoverability.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro headphone jack cuts in and out I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), and I constantly wear a pair of headphones while using it, and have for the past several years I've had it.

I've had this sort of problem before where it was caused by the headphones' audio jack (which I solved by getting new headphones), but I'm sure that that isn't the case here, because I experience no such problems when using the same headphones with my iPhone or my work computer. I'm also pretty sure it's not a software issue, as I have bluetooth headphones that I use occasionally (and don't like as much), and they don't experience similar problems.\nSo far I'm afraid to break anything further, so all I've really done is try to clean out the headphone port with a can of compressed air. Is there more I can do to repair the jack?\n\nA: The headphone jack has a connection problem - loose/broken solder joints, corroded connectors, and/or worn contacts.\nThis sentence confirms the diagnosis:\n\nTo fix the problems I have to wiggle the cord back and forth until the computer is satisfied.\n\nIf you have to take a physical action to solve a problem, it's a physical problem.  By wiggling it back and forth, you're making sure there's a good connection, but after a while it will lose it's connection again.\nTo fix this, you need to replace the headphone jack and this means electronics rework.  There are shops that specialize in this type of work and even though it's an Apple, it can be done and the shop doesn't need to be \"authorized.\"\nIf you decide not to fix it, you can use a Bluetooth headset or get a USB DAC that will allow you to connect your analog sound devices to a USB interface.\n", "Q: Upgrading RAM with 2 different memory modules I have recently upgraded the RAM of my Macbook Pro mid 2012 which initially has 2GB & 2GB in the slots to 2GB & 8GB. Now, I have a 10GB RAM in it. After a day of upgrading, I noticed that the performance of the system has increased a bit. But will two different capacities in the slots bring a problem in the future?\n\nA: DDR memory must be 'matched pairs' to get optimum performance.  That being said, any performance increase (which depends on the kinds of tasks you're running) from that pairing effect would be vastly outpaced by increasing your RAM from 4 to 10 GB, thus minimizing swaps to disk.

I cannot resize this partition to add a new one. When I tried using either Disk Utility or diskutil, it says\n\nYou can’t perform this resize unless it has a booter (target partition is probably too small)\n\nEssentially I am having the same issue as described in this question: Can't resize partition: \"You can't perform this resize unless it has a booter\"\nHowever, the answer to that question does not work for my scenario because there is no unallocated space after the single partition and I cannot manually add the booter using gdisk or gpt because of that.\nMy question is,\n\n*\n\n*is there other ways to shrink this partition, besides moving everything out and reformatting it. Or,\n\n*how do I add in the required booter partition (so that I can resize normally using Disk Utility)?\n\nNote that this is a Core Storage volume because it is encrypted.\n\n*\n\n*I had the idea of forcibly creating a new GPT table where there is enough space for the booter, but I haven't done that because I don't know how that would affect the existing partition.\n\n*I also tried using diskutil cs resizeVolume, which will resize the inner Logical Volume, and then I could add another Logical Volume after it. The problem is that these two volumes will then share the same encryption key AFAIK, which is not desirable.\n\n\nFYI, here are all the things that have happened that put me in this situation:\n\n*\n\n*This is a brand new 14 TB hard drive. I originally formatted it into two partitions: one 10TB and one 4TB. Both were HFS+ journaled encrypted (so they were Core Storage volumes).\n\n\n*Later, I attempted to resize them into 12TB/2TB using Disk Utility, which failed miserably.\n\n\n*After this, the second 4TB partition could not be found, and the first one could not be mounted. This was reported by diskutil cs info about the first partition (originally 10TB):\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 69E42F2B-A2E4-41EC-93A9-4D62C0C9082B\n|   =========================================================\n|   Name:         -none-\n|   Status:       Initializing\n|   Size:         0 B (0 B)\n|   Free Space:   -none-\n|   |\n|   +-< Physical Volume 4BBFE85D-06C3-4285-98D9-D6D30E3E4031\n|       ----------------------------------------------------\n|       Index:    0\n|       Disk:     disk2s2\n|       Status:   Failed\n|       Size:     14000175669248 B (14.0 TB)\n\n\n\n*However, I managed to completely recover the first partition (filesystem intact and fsck passed), by destroying and recreating the GPT table, in which the first partition occupies the entire disk — that is, the end of the partition is now right before the secondary GPT. Now the GPT looks like this:\n      start         size  index  contents\n          0            1         PMBR\n          1            1         Pri GPT header\n          2           32         Pri GPT table\n         34            6\n         40       409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  27344355255      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n27344764895           32         Sec GPT table\n27344764927            1         Sec GPT header\n\n\n\n*And now I cannot resize the 14TB partition.\n\nA: I followed David Anderson's advice and discovered that the partition (as described by GPT) is 3584 bytes (7 LBA blocks) larger than the Core Storage Physical Volume. Using this information, I did manage to shrink the volume to add a second partition.\nThe process is, however, quite scary: it involves a kernel panic, then some more cryptic, unhelpful, unfixable diskutil errors, and then yet some more frightening failures.\nAnd so let this be an anti-answer:\n\n*\n\n*if you are dealing with an Apple-designed filesystem (such as HFS and APFS),\n\n*and you don't have professional knowledge of the inner workings of them,\n\n*and you find your volume in an inconsistent state — it should be considered inconsistent as soon as Disk Utility starts complaining —\n\n*and yet the volume is somehow still usable (you can see your files and such):\n\nThen, for the love of your data and your well-being, instead of trying to fix the problem by meddling with the volume header or partition table (like I did),\nJust move everything out and reformat.\n\nI eventually lost no data. Here is my process. I hope that people more knowledgeable than me could point out all the mistakes I made.\nNote: 1 block is 512 bytes.\n\n*\n\n*(First, I made a copy of the first 512 bytes of the partition, which contains the Volume Header, using dd).\n\n\n*Using the gpt command, I learned that my second GPT partition (the main partition) has a size of 27344355255 blocks; following this specification of Core Storage (which is the abstraction layer that allows HFS encryption), I examined the partition volume header and learned that the Core Storage Physical Volume only occupies 27344355248 blocks. This means there was an extra space of 7 blocks.\n\n\n*I then decided to free these 7 blocks by recreating the GPT table (using the gpt command), also marking the type of the new partition as Apple Boot.\n\n\n*I attempted to create an HFS+ volume on the new partition using diskutil. This is not possible because an HFS+ volume requires a minimum of 512 KB.\n\n\n*With the unformatted Apple Boot partition, I made the risky move of asking Disk Utility to resize the 14 TB partition. This time, Disk Utility did not complain about missing booters. However, before the resizing had finished, a kernel panic struck.\n\n\n*After restarting, diskutil reported that the original 14 TB partition is now 12 TB, still intact. The 7-block Apple Boot partition now occupied the remaining 2 TB free space, still unformatted.\n\n\n*Then, I modified the GPT table again, this time adding a 262144-block Apple Boot partition after the now 12 TB partition, and another Core Storage partition taking up the remaining space.\n\n\n*At this point, both the 12 TB and 2 TB partition is showing up in Disk Utility. Upon reformatting the 2 TB partition as a JHFS+ encrypted volume (so that it too has a booter), both partitions can be resized freely using Disk Utility with no errors.\n\n\n*The only caveat was that using First Aid (diskutil verifyVolume) on the 12 TB volume now persistently reported the error \"Incorrect size for volume\" (right after it says the volume \"appears to be OK\", too). This could not be fixed using any diskutil command. But despite the error, the two volumes can still be resized and normally mounted.\n\n\n*At this point, it would seem that my original question has been solved, to a large extent.\nThis is what the partition scheme now looked like:\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER \n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *14.0 TB    disk2 \n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1 \n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage - Main Partition -      12.0 TB    disk2s2 \n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3 \n   4:          Apple_CoreStorage Time Machine            2.0 TB     disk2s4 \n   5:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s5 \n\n\n(The rest of this is me not knowing what I am doing.)\n\n*\n\n*After this, I came up with the hypothesis that the \"Incorrect volume size\" error that Disk Utility kept complaining about was about the Logical Volume, and not the Physical Volume.\n\n*\n\n*Core Storage has many abstraction layers, the order of which is Physical Volume → Logical Volume Group → Logical Volume Family → Logical Volume.\n\n*If I am understanding it correctly, PV is the closest to the GPT partition, LVF is where FileVault encryption occurs, and LV is the volume that users can see.\n\n\n\n*To test this out, I deleted the 2 TB partition via Disk Utility. There was no issue. The hard drive now contained EFI, the 14 TB partition, and the 134.2 MB booter.\n\n\n*I attempted to use diskutil cs resizeVolume to resize only the Logical Volume back to 12 TB, and not the Physical Volume. The resizing could not proceed because of the \"Incorrect volume size\" error. (The same went for diskutil cs resizeStack).\n\n\n*Then I had the horrible idea to revert not only the GPT table, but also the Core Storage volume header, to the state when this question was posted.\n\n*\n\n*This is in the hope that diskutil verifyVolume will then auto-adjust the volume size, and then I can start over the process, but resize the Logical Volume first.\n\n*I made a backup of the current volume header, then dd rewrote the first 512 bytes of the volume using the backup .img file I made of the header at the start of this answer.\n\n*After I did that, the 14 TB volume once again was unmountable. All diskutil operations would fail at this point.\n\n\n\n*I attempted to revert this change by writing the 512-byte volume header back. Then, another kernel panic occurred.\n\n\n*This time, things got much more serious. For the next few hours, every time I connected the hard drive to my laptop, macOS immediately kernel panicked — whether it was in normal mode, Recovery, Safe Mode, or Single User Mode.\n\n\n*I tried booting into Ubuntu from USB, and examine and manipulate the Volume Header from there, to no avail.\n\n\n*I almost lost hope, when I remembered that, back when the partition first failed, I ran dd through the first few GBs of the partition and saved it as an image, which was since deleted. I recovered it using Disk Drill, and after painfully comparing hex dumps, I decided to copy the first 62500 blocks (32 MB) of the image file back to the partition.\n\n*\n\n*My idea was that this would cause macOS to recognize the volume in the same way that it recognized the original 14 TB volume when it first failed, and then if I redo the steps I described in the question (recreating the GPT table), I could get the volume back a second time, and I thought that the worst that could happen is I would lose all file changes since the partition first failed.\n\n\n\n*Shockingly, not only did this recover the partition, but all the files that were on the hard drive before I broke the partition the second time are still there.\n\n\n*Now I am in the process of backing up everything so that I can start the hard drive fresh.\n\nTo reiterate: when in the slightest doubt, backup!\n", "Q: How to extend PATH of LaunchAgents in ~/Library/LaunchAgents?

The opening is smooth no doubt but I have to use other hand to the base.\nIs this uncommon?\n\nA: This is totally normal. The variation in the clutch and hinge strength is quite low. The variation in hand placement, position, size, strength, number of digits and bones in people’s hands vary widely.\nThe kids are designed more for staying open at an angle for years than always opening with the weight of the bottom.\nStarting from the MacBook Air and especially the MacBook 12 the weight of the processor is almost never enough to lift only the lid with one finger. Gravity usually needs an assist until many years of wear and openings have happened. Same with the Pro, but those have a higher base to lid weight ratio and you can sometimes get some of them to open without jiggling.\n", "Q: Unhide hidden app purchases on iOS 14.2 I have hidden a number of app purchases, and I would now like to unhide them.

My Pictures folder was archived by Backblaze.\nAfter I installed Catalina, I attempted to open the Photos library (restored from Backblaze) and got this message:\n\nI don't recall the process exactly, but I was able to open Photos which included some of the original photos.  As you can see, this new library (highlighted) is substantially smaller than the other libraries:\n\nHow do I get the photographs and the meta data from my older library?\n\nA: The first thing to check is whether Photos Library.photoslibrary (the 53.31GB one) is Catalina- or Mojave-compatible (Or neither - i.e. it's somehow got corrupted).\nIf you have access to two Macs - one running Catalina and the other Mojave, try to open the library on both and see which one can open it. Do make sure you're opening the correct library (Since you have more than one):\n\n*\n\n*In Mojave, open Photos > Preferences > Library location > Click on the current library, navigate to where your desired library is located, and select it.\n\n\n*In Catalina, open Photos > Preferences > System library. Navigate to where this library is located, and set it as the system library.\nIf you don't have two Macs, try this: Right-click on the Photos library > select Show package contents > If there's a folder named Masters, it's Mojave. If there's a folder named Originals, it's Catalina (Be very careful not to make any changes to any of the folders or files, otherwise it'll corrupt the library).\nIf you open Masters or Originals, the unmodified versions of all your photos will be in there. Latest edited versions (for Catalina) will be in Resources > Derivatives. An easier way to extract the photos along with metadata is with a Mac app named Photos Takeout, but that will only work if your library isn't corrupted.\n\nA: I upgraded to the non-beta edition of Bur Sur, which allowed me to open the newer file (which contained all of my photographs).\nIs doesn't answer my original question, however.\n", "Q: Mail: all accounts set to offline but still receive emails In Mac Mojave, when I want to focus on work then I switch all email accounts in Mail.app to offline mode.

Safari only provides a \"quick viewer\" of sorts for PDF files and is only rendering what was provided.\nWhat you need to do is open it in Preview.\n\nSimply right click anywhere on the PDF in Safari and select \"Open With Preview.\"  Once you're in Preview, you can rotate the PDF with ⌘ CommandL or ⌘ CommandR to rotate left and right respectively.\n\nA: Using Preview is a terrific alternative as mentioned above.\nPreview can even save the PDF with the new rotation.

The signal is there, but it may not be sufficient enough to be detected.\n\nMy question is could I go from HDMI to DVI, then from DVI to VGA; would it work?\n\nNo, I don't advise this at all (note:  it may \"work,\" but it won't be reliable). A general rule is more conversions = more points of failure.   You are better off making a single conversion:  HDMI → VGA.  Less complexity = better reliability.\nYour best bet is to get an active HDMI to VGA adapter.\nThe key to getting a reliable signal is using an active adapter. (The above link described a similar question regarding a Mac mini as well).   The difference between an active and a passive adapter is that the former recreates the actual signal whereas the latter only \"reorganizes\" the pins outs.\n", "Q: How to determine if all items in a list are the same I'm currently in the works of an AppleScript calculator that extrapolates arithmetic linear sequences (sounds fancy but it really isn't). One of the processes it must go through is finding the common difference between each item. Plugging this difference (d) into the equation for arithmetic progression, along with the term you want to know (n) will predict the nth term in any sequence.\nTo determine the common difference, you must first find the local difference between each pair of numbers in the sequence. Then, compare every difference; if they're all the same, the sequence is linear and the common difference is equal to the local difference. If not, the sequence is nonlinear and there is no common difference. I've figured out how to find the local differences of each number, but the latter seems to be a bigger challenge. The code I've made to determine the local differences spits out a list of numbers. My theoretical process would just compare the first item to every other, and if every comparison returns as true, then set the common difference to the same as the local difference. Below is my way of finding the local difference of a list of numbers:\nset sequence to {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}\nset x to 0\nset dif_check to {}\nrepeat ((number of items of sequence) - 1) times\n   set x to (x + 1)\n   set selected_item to (item x of sequence)\n   set local_dif to ((item (x + 1) of sequence) - selected_item)\n   set dif_check to dif_check & {local_dif}\nend repeat\nreturn dif_check\n--> result: {1, 1, 1, 0}\n(* Since every item in the resulting list isn't equal, it would be nonlinear and the common difference would just be n/a. *)\n\nHow would I determine if every item in a list is the same? I've tried numerous times, including this script I experimented with, but I realized it didn't get me anywhere closer to the resolution:\nset dif_check to {1, 1, 1, 0}\nset first_term to (first item of dif_check)\nset x to 1\nset common_dif_check to {}\nrepeat ((number of items of dif_check) - 1) times\n   set x to (x + 1)\n   (item x of dif_check) = first_term\n   set common_dif_check to common_dif_check & {result}\nend repeat\nreturn common_dif_check\n--> result: {true, true, false}\n(* This takes the first item of the list and compares it with every item after, returning a true or false and adding the result to another list. I thought this would have solved it, but instead just turns out as the same situation as before. *)\n\nTo reiterate, how would I determine if every item in a list is the same? Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I’m not sure if this will help but this following code will remove duplicate items from a list and create a new list from the results. It will then count the items of the new list and if the items in that new list is greater than 1 … that means all of the items of the original list were not the same\nproperty difCheck : {1, 1, 1, 0}\nproperty allItemsAreTheSame : missing value\n\nset itemCount to count of removeDuplicates(difCheck)\n\nif itemCount is greater than 1 then\n    set allItemsAreTheSame to false\nelse\n    set allItemsAreTheSame to true\nend if\n\non removeDuplicates(theList)\n    script k\n        property |List| : theList\n        property tmpList : {}\n    end script\n    repeat with itemRef in k's |List|\n        set theItem to itemRef's contents\n        if k's tmpList does not contain theItem then ¬\n            set k's tmpList's end to theItem\n    end repeat\n    return k's tmpList\nend removeDuplicates\n\n\nA: Only a couple of modifications required.\nset dif_check to {1, 1, 1, 0}\nset first_term to (first item of dif_check)\nset x to 1\nset terms_are_same to true\nrepeat ((number of items of dif_check) - 1) times\n    set x to (x + 1)\n    if ((item x of dif_check) ≠ first_term) then\n        set terms_are_same to false\n    end if\nend repeat\nreturn terms_are_same\n\nThe trick is to use a variable that is set to true unless one of the comparisons fails.\n", "Q: iOS 14 broke my Shortcut I have a shortcut that I created in 2019 and it stopped working after iOS 14 upgrade.

Only a few specific ports/protocols are allowed. I have a pretty basic set of rules that work very well.\nWhile working on a different problem, I realized I could add a few more rules and button things down even tighter by specifying specific ports on specific network interfaces. So for example, on one network interface, only access to 80 & 443 are allowed, no mail or vpn access to that interface.\nSo here is what one of the old rules looked like:\npass in quick proto tcp from any to any port { 80 443 } keep state\n\nAnd this is what one of the new rules looks like:\npass in quick proto tcp from any to en1 port { 80 443 } keep state\n\nThe difference is subtle but I'm specifying a specific network interface, not just in to 'any'. This particular server has three connections to the internet.\nThe problem is... pf will no longer start up right at boot with these new rules. When I specify the interface, my pf startup script fails to start pf. And I have to do it manually through the terminal.\nAt first glance, the problem seems like my script is probably just trying to use network interfaces that aren't up yet. But I'm already waiting for them to come up. Here is my pf startup script, it has been working perfectly for years, until this rule change.\n#!/bin/bash\nipconfig waitall\n/sbin/pfctl -e -f /etc/pf.conf\n\nWith the new rules, nothing gets loaded at system startup when this runs. But if I run the same pfctl command once the system is up, it loads the rules and starts the firewall just fine.\nI modified my script to save multiple copies of ifconfig so I could see how the status of the two interfaces en0 and en1 progress. Before the ipconfig waitall command, they are there with no IPs. After the command, they still have no ips and they show up as 'inactive'. Over the next few seconds, the various IPs start to load up. But the two interfaces show up the whole time.\nSo the easy patch solution would be to just run ipconfig waitall followed by sleep 6 and call it a day. But I'd rather learn exactly what is causing the hangup so I can wait for that exact 'thing' to be ready, instead of leaving the firewall completely open for 6 seconds. It is a high traffic server and gets lots of hack/ddos attempts so every second may count.\n\nA: There is a small error within your added rule:\npass in quick proto tcp from any to en1 port { 80 443 } keep state\n\nthe fields after the key from and to shoud be IP address and port specification, but not an interface name.\nTo apply your rule explicitly on incoming traffic on interface en1, you should write like this, with macro so as to be able to\nmaintain your PF rules very quickly:\next_if = \"en1\"\n\npass in quick on $ext_if proto tcp from any to any port { 80 443 } keep state\n\nIf you test the loading of your pf.conf interactively, pfctl should warn you about a syntax error. As a positive side effect this rule will be independant of the\nIP address attributed to en1, thus you won't have any\nkind os synchronization do wait.\n\nA: Read this article about DDoS attacks maybe it will help to you\nhttps://journalofcyberpolicy.com/2020/10/02/33-types-of-ddos-attacks-dissected/\n\nA: You shouldn't have to create your own plist to enable the pf firewall on boot especially since you're using the default rule set.  You just need to enable it.  This will launch at the \"correct time\" when all of your interfaces are configured and up.\nStep 1:  Edit the Apple supplied plist\nThe file you're looking for is  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist.\nChange the Disabled key from \"true\" to \"false\".  Here's what it should look like:\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Disabled</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.apple.pfctl</string>\n    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>\n    <string>/var/run</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/sbin/pfctl</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>pfctl</string>\n        <string>-f</string>\n        <string>/etc/pf.conf</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nStep 2:  Load (or reload) the plist with launchctl\n% sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist\n\nStep 3:  Firewall should be enabled upon boot.\n\nMy recommendation...\nYou should not expose the Mac (or any server) directly to the Internet but instead, it should be behind a firewall box/appliance!\nDon't get me wrong - I am a huge fan of pf.  You should still enable the pf firewall on the Mac.   However, if what you're saying is correct that even for a couple seconds you get slammed with DDoS attacks, the (Mac) server shouldn't be dealing with them; your firewall should.  In fact, you should have a proper pfSense firewall in front of this server.  By having a separate firewall, the Mac will always be protected regardless of its status (i.e. an inadvertent rule change mistakenly opens it up).\nYou also gain the advantage of being able to run packages like pfBlocker-NG on the appliance (will drop connections from known bad actors based on black/white lists) giving you a higher level of protection.  Having it on the appliance frees up your Mac from having to handle those processes.\n", "Q: Customise drop shadow size (larger) in Preview.app In Preview you can draw shapes.\nYou can add a drop shadow to these shapes.\nHowever, I can't seem to figure out how to make the drop shadow larger.\nOn the scale of the image I am annotating, the drop shadow just looks like a tiny black border.\n\nA: Preview doesn't support this.\nI solved it by drawing a square inside of a fully transparent image, adding the drop shadow, saving it, closing it, reopening it, then rotating and resizing the drop shadow until it fit my needs and copy/pasting it into my original document.\n", "Q: Macos opens Instruments when I press \"Command\" + \"~\" The default combination to switch between windows of the current app in macOS is ⌘ Command `.

What is the technical name of the following file-open capabilities of macOS programs?\n\n*\n\n*open a file that is dragged from the Finder onto the applications’s dock icon\n\n*open a file from the \"Open with\" Finder dialog in a specific application\n\n*open a file that is \"sent to\" the application by a third party application like LaunchBar?\n\n\nA: In all instances, it's called \"opening a file.\"  macOS (like other operating systems including Windows and Linux) support multiple methods of opening a file.\n\n*\n\n*Drag and Drop is supported throughout the OS.  If you drag and drop a file onto another graphical element, it will (attempt to) open that file within the context of that element.  If it's a folder, Finder will open that folder to accept the file.  If it's an application, it will open that application with that file (as input).\n\n\n*Open With is just an alternative to the default action of \"Open\" in Finder which uses the file's default associated application.  This allows you to select from alternates registered with macOS or manually select an app.\n\n\n*A 3rd party app does the same thing by opening a file with it's associated default or alternate application.  There's no different method of opening files as already provided for by the OS.\nThe applications associated with different file types are registered in LaunchServices.  So a PDF might be associated with Preview or Adobe Acrobat Reader.  LaunchServices will have those relationships established within it's database.  This is how \"Open With...\" is populated with alternate apps.\nFrom a command line perspective, this is how you can have a .doc or .docx file automatically be opened by Word, for example when typing\n% open foobar.doc\n\nBut then, if you want to open it with Pages, you can issue the command\n% open -a Pages foobar.doc\n\nYou can also launch the application and specify the file as a \"command line argument\" even for a file that's not even associated with an app (you wouldn't use a browser to view text files even though it is supported).\n% /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox ~/Desktop/foobar.txt\n\n", "Q: I can't find LINE IN - Audio Input Problem with a Mac Book pro early 2015 I'm trying to record on my Mac book pro early 2015,  but the Line-In port does not appear.

NO Way.\nUnthinkable there is no solution to be able to boot into Catalina or into High Sierra on a new iMac 2020.\n\nA: Your sticking point is actually much simpler than that.\nNo Mac can boot to an OS older than itself.\nThere's the occasional edge-case when a new Mac is released right on the cusp of a new OS, but otherwise, it's simply not possible. There are no drivers for the hardware in the older OS, as the hardware hadn't been invented yet, so Apple stops you from even trying.\nYour only solution would be to run High Sierra in a Virtual Machine.\n\nA: Sad but true, same answer as stated by @Tetsujin in other words, obviously this rule holds:\nYou can safely go back without risk to any version that came out after the Mac model came out. Else you run the risk that the old OS X doesn't know what to do with the new hardware features and becomes unstable.\nReference found in Apple Support Communities\n", "Q: Restoring Saved Webpages on Home Screen from Backup I ran into an update issue with my iPad, and took it to the Apple store to fix it.

I managed to restore my information from a backup that was made a few months back, but one of the most important things that wasn't restored were a large number of Safari webpages saved to the homescreen, organized into sub-folders, etc. These represent quite a large time investment to manually restore, and it may be impossible for me to do so from memory.\nI read through this post about restoring additional information through an iTunes re-sync, but I'm not sure that the linked scenario applies here, and I don't have a device to test this with.\nI tried reaching out to Apple support / the Apple store, but they could not or would not help me.\nAny help that you could provide to restore these saved webpages would be incredibly appreciated! :)\n\nA: For a restore to work, the data must be backed up in the first place.\n\nI managed to restore my information from a backup that was made a few months back, but one of the most important things that wasn't restored were a large number of Safari webpages saved to the home screen\n\nThe critical piece here is,  was all that work you did backed up at any point?

Am I missing something?\nAlso, what should be the appropriate allocation size considering I am planning to store photos, documents and backup data? For eg. this review suggests formatting the hard disk before using with appropriate allocation size on Windows (like 128kb).\nIf we follow the answer provided here, could you please explain how to change allocation size (instead of device block size) with newfs_exfat\nPlatform: macOS High Sierra\nVersion 10.13.6\n\nA: The diskutil command is a more reliable than the Disk Utility application when creating two ExFAT partitions on a drive. I do not believe you can specify the Allocation Block Size when ExFAT formatting a partition with either the diskutil command or Disk Utility application. However, you can with the newfs_exfat command.\nThe Allocation Block Size was originally referred to as the cluster size. Microsoft defines the cluster size as follows:\n\nCluster size represents the smallest amount of disk space that can be used to hold a file. When file sizes do not come out to an even multiple of the cluster size, additional space must be used to hold the file (up to the next multiple of the cluster size).\n\nBasically, a larger cluster size results in faster access times, but at a cost of more wasted space. Certainly, if you have a large number of files significantly smaller that the cluster size, then you will find the volume is consuming far more space than the sum of the file sizes. The is no easy way to answer what you should choose for a cluster size. This really depends on the quantity and size of the files themselves.\nThere are alternatives, if you are using the disk to archive documents. For example, you could create a single file compressed archive of many documents. This eliminates the wasted space that normally occurs at the end of each file. Again, accessing an archive usually take additional time. You can easily create a zip archive by using the Finder Application. However, you can not use the Finder to view the contents of a zip file without first unzipping the file. You can list the contents of a zip file by using commands entered in a Terminal window. Or you can install a third party tool with a GUI. You can also use the Disk Utility to create a compressed dmg file. Here, you can use the Finder to mount and view the contains of a dmg file without first having to extract the contents.\nExample\nBelow is an example where a 1 TB disk is partitioned into two 500 GB ExFAT volumes. Here the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme is used. The identifier for this disk is disk1. Basically, you specify the size of the first partition and the rest of the space is allocated to the second partition.

I have been tasked with \"fixing\" my wife's MacBook. I'm a technical support engineer for SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD on the Windows platform, so I have to do a lot of self-learning with the MacOS environment as I go. I've exhausted everything I could find mentioned online and would be very appreciative of some insight from more experienced users.\nTHE GOAL\n\n*\n\n*Access the HD to recover important documents and pictures.\n\nTHE SITUATION\n\n*\n\n*My wife left her computer unused for many months. The battery ran\nout and it was left 100% dead for a good while.\n\n\n*When charging it back up and trying to log in, the machine will not accept my wife's machine password (she had written it down previously). We've tried over 50 iterations. We tried all passwords and all permutations of any Apple passwords past and present. No dice.\n\n\n*So far, no method of resetting the password has been successful.\n\n\n*The machine seemingly can't connect to the internet to reset the password via Apple ID even though I have verified it is connected to Wifi. I tried multiple networks to rule out faulty internet. It rejects incorrect passwords, so I know it actually connects when the Wifi credentials are entered correctly. At this point, her Apple ID is the only credential I can independently verify is accurate.\n\n\n*My wife inadvertently activated FileVault and can't remember if/where she stored the Recovery Key. Big \"uh-oh.\"\n\n\n*Because FileVault is active, I cannot access the macOS Utilities (⌘+R held while booting) to run the 'resetpassword' command in the Terminal. It only boots to the Recovery OS which isn't helpful.\n\n\n*I also am locked out of single-user startup (⌘+S held while booting) which is disabled when FileVault is active. I was hoping to run some command-line codes to reset the password or create and admin account.

During its November 10, 2020 event, Apple has announced that Adobe is bringing its major apps to Apple Silicon, starting with the Lightroom photography software. They also said that all current versions will continue to run, but the new ones will take advantage of Apple Silicon directly. How can it be the current versions will run on the new ARM processor, since they were compiled for x86 Intel processors?\n\nA: Apple is using Rosetta 2. Scroll down the page for this bit:\n\n“With Big Sur and M1, Mac users can run a greater range of apps than ever before. All of Apple’s Mac software is now Universal and runs natively for M1 systems. Existing Mac apps that have not been updated to Universal will run seamlessly with Apple’s Rosetta 2 technology.”\n\n\nA: Apple includes a software called Rosetta that works like a \"bridge\" between the Apple Silicon and Intel by \"translating\" the intel binaries into Apple Silicon binaries that can be executed on Apple Silicon.\nReference and more details:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment?language=objc\n\nA: When they transitioned from PowerPC to Intel, they made Rosetta so PPC apps can run on Intel.

What now? I've always found it difficult to get pictures out of my own iPhone, yet still doable with enough work. But my wife's iPhone is another animal. I am at a total loss with this iPhone 7+ (iOS 13.3.1), I feel like I've tried virtually everything. Here's what I want from this iPhone:\n\n*\n\n*All files in their original qualities.\n\n*All metadata, especially timestamps that tell you when the picture was taken.\n\n*All original internal image names (IMG_0678.JPG, etc.) used by the iPhone, not goofy new ones made up by Windows (001.JPG).\n\nHere's what I've tried to get these darn jpegs out of this aluminum jail cell. In all of these cases, when relevant, I have 'trusted this computer' on the iPhone.\nIn MacOS 10.14:\n\n*\n\n*iTunes (up-to-date): iTunes could not connect to this iPhone. Could not save the pairing record.\n\n\n*Airdrop from iPhone to Macbook: Freezes on the iPhone whenever I try to export an image with airdrop. Also in the past, if I remember correctly, the Macbook would recognise the iPhone but the iPhone would not recognise the computer (or maybe it was the other way around).\n\n\n*Photos app: Device is recognised, but no photos are found.\n\n\n*Image Capture app: Device is recognised, but no photos are found.\n\n\n*Third party app, iFunbox: Device pairing required. Please launch iTunes and pair your iOS device with this Mac.\nI have not tried iCloud, because I have more than 200GB of pictures to transfer and only 5GB of space on iCloud.\nIn Windows 7:\n\n\n*Windows explorer shows the iPhone (sometimes), but its content usually appears empty. When it does not appear empty, it shows the DCIM folder, which itself usually appears empty. Once it did not appear empty and the pictures were there, but when I repeatedly tried copying the contents of one of the 26 1XXAPPLE folders (1 folder is about 1300 files), the copy process randomly stopped with no error message after having successfully copied 4 files. The 'copying' progress box simply vanished and copying stopped. On inspection of one of the photos that was ''successfully'' copied, I notice that the original image on the iPhone had a size of 2.88MB, whereas the copy I had made on Windows had a size of 26.4KB.\n\n\n*Right click iPhone in Windows Explorer and click 'Import Pictures and Videos': After copying about 5 photos it outputs The following error occurred while importing IMG_0688.MOV: The exact error is unknown. Make a note of this error code, which might be useful if you seek additional help to resolve this problem: 80042007. What do you want to do? (a) Try again (b) Skip this file (c) Skip all files with errors ''Try again'' leads to the same problem. ''Skip this file'' leads to one successful file copied and then the same problem with IMG_0693.JPG. ''Skip this file'' again leads to the same problem on the next photo. ''Skip all files with errors'' skips most (about two thirds of) files. Also this approach gives the files imported into Windows new names (001.JPG, 002.JPG, instead of IMG_0692.JPG, IMG_0693.JPG). Not only is this confusing, but it's also annoying because with the IMG_XXX.JPG system, only photos taken on this iPhone had an IMG_XXX.JPG name, whereas with the 001.JPG system all JPGs including random photos received from contacts on whatsapp get a 001.JPG style name.\n\n\n*iTunes (up-to-date): Produces error message: iTunes cannot read the contents of the iPhone 'iPhone of X'. Go to the Summary tab in iPhone preferences and click Restore to restore this iPhone to factory settings. Would erase the photos, so not acceptable.\n\n\n*Third party software, attempt 1 -- Some freeware on my wife's computer a while back: This has allowed me to export pictures, but it failed to export their metadata (time taken, etc.), making the exports not really acceptable.\n\n\n*Third party software, attempt 2 -- Nero Kwik Media: Requesting to discover files on the iPhone crashes the program.\nIn Ubuntu 18.04:\n\n\n*Usually an iPhone's filesystem is directly accessible in the file manager. Instead, when I plug in the phone I get a dialog box: Unable to mount X's iPhone - Unhandled Lockdown error (-3).\n\nWhat's wrong with this iPhone? Is it a regional problem? We bought it last year refurbished from Amazon UK when we were living in the UK and we now live in Canada. It's hard for me to believe that all of these problems are independent. Apart from this problem, the iPhone works well. There are about 26,500 photos and 3300 videos to export.\nUp next, 12. Send myself 2650 emails for the photos and forget about the videos?\n\nA: In cases like this, I've found iExplorer the only way to 'crack the aluminum jail cell', so to speak. It has macOS and Windows versions of the app, and a free trial version to experiment with before purchase. It can also open iTunes backups of the device on your Mac/Windows device as well. If the backup is encrypted, you will need the password.\nDisclaimer: I'm a very satisfied customer of Macroplant LLC, and have no financial or other ties with the organization.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to move tabs around in Firefox on a Mac The equivalent of it in Windows would be Ctrl + Shift + PgUp / PgDn.

When that window closes, the rest here will be true...\n\nYou have to break a bunch of preconditions to jailbreak a device and load older versions in iOS since they are designed to be updated only and never regress. The short answer is without you listing exactly what you have done, letting the current version be reinstalled is the pragmatic solution to a working phone that isn’t broken.\nThe version you downloaded may be tampered with and it certainly isn’t signed by Apple so you’re in essence asking how to set up your own trust chain to run unsigned code.\nThe problems you experience are normal, expected when you attempt to downgrade with perfectly working hardware.\n", "Q: GMail option missing from share sheet on iOS I'm running iOS 14 and use both Mail.app and Gmail (personal and work respectively).

Is it true that if we dual boot Mojave and Catalina, or if we dual boot Catalina and Big Sur, we can go the traditional way of creating two APFS partitions, and each partition is one container and in it, just have one volume and it is Mojave or Catalina, respectively. Each OS would then have a fixed size (for example, 250GB each, on a 500GB SSD drive).\nBut with APFS, we could also have one single APFS partition on the physical hard drive -- and so it is one container, and then create two volumes: one for Mojave and one for Catalina, and they can dual boot this way?  This actually has the benefits that each OS is not limited to a fixed size, because Mojave can be 150GB and Catalina can grow to 350GB, and if Catalina goes down to 200GB, now Mojave can grow to 300GB -- dynamic flexible sizing?\n\nA: Below is an example of where the macOS versions named Mojave, Catalina and Big Sur (beta) have been installed in the same container.

This is not true. In this example, Mojave uses 4 volumes, Catalina uses 5 volumes and Big Sur uses 6 volumes. The Preboot (disk1s2), Recovery (disk1s3) and VM (disk1s4) volumes are shared by all three macOS versions.\nBelow are the result of enter commands to get the volume uuid for the MyMojave, MyCatalina and MyBigSur - Data volumes. Each UUID is generated when a volume is created and therefore all such UUIDs are unique.\ndma@dmas-Mac-mini ~ % diskutil info MyMojave | grep \"Volume UUID\"\n   Volume UUID:               7C48B3D0-263E-4C25-9268-FD4001759334\ndma@dmas-Mac-mini ~ % diskutil info MyCatalina | grep \"Volume UUID\"\n   Volume UUID:               DCC8D3B0-3308-4FCC-B057-D4CE495A91FF\ndma@dmas-Mac-mini ~ % diskutil info \"MyBigSur - Data\" | grep \"Volume UUID\"\n   Volume UUID:               383CF355-F467-48CE-9124-B24149322EA7\n\nNormally, macOS boots from the Preboot volume. Although all three macOS version share the same Preboot volume, they do not share the same preboot software. The preboot software for each macOS version is stored in a folder which has the same name as the UUID for a volume uniquely used by each macOS version. For this example, the boot software for MyBigSur is be stored in the folder named 383CF355-F467-48CE-9124-B24149322EA7 on the Preboot volume. Note that the name of the folder is the same as the volume UUID for the \"MyBigSur - Data\" volume given above.\nBasically, the same setup is used to store the macOS Recovery software for each version of macOS, except the Recovery (disk1s3) volume is used.\nThe VM (disk1s4) volume is used by all three versions of macOS for virtual memory.\nMojave has an additional volume which is the root volume. For this example, this root volume is named MyMojave and has the identifier disk1s1.\nWhen booted to Catalina⁩, the root volume is mounted read-only. For this example, this root volume is named MyCatalina⁩  and has the identifier disk1s6. Catalina has an additional volume which is both read and writeable. For this example, this volume is named MyCatalina - Data and has the identifier disk1s5.\nWhen booted to Big Sur, the volume is named MyBigSur(disk1s8) is not even mounted. Instead, a snapshot volume (disk1s8s1) is mount as root. Big Sur has an additional volume which is both read and writeable. For this example, this volume is named MyBigSur - Data and has the identifier disk1s5.\n", "Q: Is there a macOS equivalent of the Windows assoc command? I am looking to change a file association on the Mac using some sort of script. I know that I can do something like that in Windows using the assoc  command.\nIs there something scriptable on macOS which will do a similar job?\n\nA: No. Apple file mapping is implemented very differently than windows does it. The file metadata has many variables that affect launch services and mapping a particular file to a particular app.\n", "Q: Microsoft Outlook on the Mac App Store - no option for in app purchase Microsoft Outlook on the Mac App Store requires an Office 365 subscription. There is supposed to be an option to subscribe using an in app purchase - I want to use this option.\nHowever, the darn thing never gives me any option to do so. I initially tried to activate using an old account, but that account does not have an Office 365 subscription.\n\nI have tried in vain to remove every trace of Outlook and start over - I've removed the keychain entry for \"Office,\" and removed more or less everything with \"Microsoft\" in the name in ~/Library (including the obvious stuff in ~/Library/Containers, /Library, and /System/Library. I've removed the application from /Applications as well, emptied the trash, and rebooted.\nI have tried clicking \"Stay Offline,\" to open outlook, and then open its list of accounts - there are none. I have also tried using outlooks profile tool to remove the existing profile, to no effect.\nBut once I install the app from the Mac App Store, the blasted account is still listed. I do not have any other office applications installed.\nSo, how can I either (a) reset outlook completely so it doesn't show this account (and thus hopefully gives me the option to use an in-app purchase to subscribe, or (b) force outlook to activate using an in-app purchase?\n\nA: For any future readers, the Mac app store version of Outlook simply does not work the way I expected. You will not be given the option to subscribe using an in-app purchase until after you have created or logged in with a Microsoft account.\nOnce you have logged in with a Microsoft account, then will you have the option to subscribe using an in-app purchase.\n", "Q: Is it safe to still use an iBook G4 on Wi-Fi? I have recently bought an iBook to run a specific software. The machine is still pretty good but I was chatting with someone and they recommended not connecting it to Wi-Fi.\nIs there an issue with doing this? Is it unsafe for some reason?\n\nA: What your friend is likely talking about is not connecting it to the Internet as the newest macOS that works on that Mac is OLD.\nAnd that matters because it does not have the benefit of updated patches to macOS that make it more secure and more importantly it runs a badly outdated version of Safari that may not even connect to most modern websites due to standards changes in web publishing and the outdated security certificates built-into old versions of macOS.\nDepending on which iBook you have you may be able to install a more modern browser. I have an old G4 tower with some older, never updated, apps on it that I use from time to time and use a version of Firefox called TenFourFox. It (as I have been told) supports G3 and G4 processors. So that particular browser would be safe to use due to its more modern foundations, if slow on modern websites.\nI believe there are other, alternative, browsers for legacy versions of macOS, but I have no direct experience with them. Other folks here may be able to chime in and offer suggestions, but it would be good if you edited your original question and add the model of iBook you have and the version of macOS installed on it.\nBut without a more modern browser I would also suggest you avoid connecting to the Internet, merely for safety reasons. Wi-Fi, itself, is likely okay as long as you are only using it to transfer files between your local Macs and not going out onto the Internet.\n", "Q: How to downgrade Composer via homebrew? My Composer updated to version 2 but I need to keep it running in version 1.\nHow could I downgrade my Composer via Homebrew since I don't see different formulas to version 1 and 2?\nI already tried to run these commands below but it didn't work.\nbrew switch composer 1.10.15\nbrew install composer@1.10.15\n\n\nA: To check the versions available you can run this command:\nbrew log composer\n\n\nThen install Composer and change the version directly via Composer command.\nbrew install composer\ncomposer self-update 1.10.15\n\nTo toggle between the 1.x and 2.x:\ncomposer self-update --1\ncomposer self-update --2\n\n", "Q: Default paper size for 4\" x 6\" label printer - Mac OS 10.15.7 I have two 4\" x 6\" label printers.

If the filenames do *not* begin\n# with \"/\", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so \"logs/access_log\"\n# with ServerRoot set to \"/usr/local/apache2\" will be interpreted by the\n# server as \"/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log\", whereas \"/logs/access_log\" \n# will be interpreted as '/logs/access_log'.\n\n#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.

I need for the javascript and css to work (though naturally I understand anything that makes external requests will not work, this is fine). I am happy to download the html files and assorted assets if it helps though I suspect it will not.\n'Reading List' does nothing for me. Safari is enabled to back up to my iCloud, I have safari set to automatically save offline. But every webpage (e.g. a wikipedia article) I have picked, if I add it to the reading list and then go offline, it tells me I can't view it.\n\nA: Thanks Kevin Grabher for the answer.\nFor those who want to use this, to get to 'Send As' you should press 'options' after pressing the bottom middle button.\nThere are natural and understandable limitations, namely that you will need to make sure you arrange things such that you capture all the assets in doing this. There's several ways to do so. For me I just inlined the assets I needed, hosted locally on my computer, accessed my local server, did this webarchive thing and hey presto, it works!\n", "Q: Suddenly \"Safari Starts With: A New Window\" Setting Is Missing I have a macbook pro 13\" from 2015 running Mojave at the moment.

It is an Apple USB non-cordless mouse; the Mac came with a cordless mouse but that died.\nIt usually comes good after unplugging and replugging the mouse from the USB port, a few times.\nIt is possibly a hardware issue, but if it is, why does right-clicking do anything at all?\nProbably the only \"uncommon\" way I use my Mac is I leave the emacs editor constantly running; emacs is a huge program and I guess there is a chance it is doing something strange.\nIs this a known issue? Or does it sound like a hardware issue?\n\nA: In fact it was a hardware issue. I confirmed this by waiting for the behaviour to reappear, then plugging the mouse into a different computer. (See comments below the question).\n", "Q: Any way to watch Netflix on an iOS device running outdated software? We recently bought a used 1stGen iPad Air (MD788LL/A).  It looks like we can't install the Netflix app because it requires iOS 13, and our iPad cannot be updated to that version of the operating system.  Is there any way to work around this?  Is it possible, for example, to watch Netflix in the Safari browser?\n\nA: If you don't have access to a newer iOS device, or don't want to mess up the accounts on your friend's phone, you can \"purchase\" an app through an older version of iTunes.  Apple provides links for the last app store enabled iTunes versions.\nOf course, not all apps will work on older devices, even if there's a version of the app that's compatible.  For instance, an online game might no longer be supported on the game's servers.  Or Netflix could drop support for older iOS devices.\n\nA: It is a common thing among outdated apple devices.\nIf you have a friend, relative or access to any device with the latest iOS, just open up your account from them.\nInstall the app, delete it and log out.\nOnce you go back to your own device, the app will be listed in your \"Purchased\" section.\nWhen you press download from there, the prompt will say something like (paraphrasing) \"The latest version of Netflix is not compatible with your version of iOS, do you want to install latest compatible version?\"\nFrom then, you can install the app and use it up until Netflix cuts support for that version of app.\n\nA: If you're looking for a more long-term solution, you can probably jailbreak your iPad considering its iOS version. There are multiple jailbreak tweaks such as AppAdmin that allow you to download and install earlier versions of applications; you can find one that is compatible with your device, and then use it.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina, macOS Big Sur and Windows 10 - Triple Boot Plan With the release of macOS Big Sur, I am contemplating the following plan and wanted to get some advise on any risks or if this plan will even work or not. My current setup is:\n\n*\n\n*macOS Catalina as the primary OS - This on an APFS container.\n\n*Blank Placeholder for macOS Big Sur - This is also an APFS container.\n\n*Bootcamp Partition for Windows 10.\n\nI plan to install macOS Big Sur on the blank placeholder above; know that it is a separate container and not a new volume on the same container as the primary OS.\nI have a lot of customizations on macOS Catalina and will not be able to do a clean install, migrate all apps, change all settings and migrate all customizations in one day. Allowing me to choose which OS I want to boot into will allow me to take it slowly.\nWhen the day comes that I no longer need macOS Catalina all I need to do is delete the container and resize the macOS Big Sur container to take up all the space that's left. Will this -\n\n*\n\n*Cause any issues with iCloud Music and iCloud Photo libraries as I will use them on both macOS Catalina and macOS Big Sur?\n\n*Jeopardize my Bootcamp partition in any way?\n\n*Allow me to reclaim the space used by macOS Catalina currently so when I remove it I can allocate that space to macOS Big Sur?\n\n*Any other issues?\n\nAny advise is welcome and appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*Cause any issues with iCloud Music and iCloud Photo libraries as I will use them on both macOS Catalina and macOS Big Sur?\nNo.\n\n\n*Jeopardize my Bootcamp partition in any way?\nNo.\n\n\n*Allow me to reclaim the space used by macOS Catalina currently so when I remove it I can allocate that space to macOS Big Sur?\nNo.\nI would suggest one of the following two alternatives.\n\n*\n\n*Use the Disk Utility to add a new APFS volume in the same APFS container partition as Catalina, then install Big Sur to this new APFS volume. Later, you can use the Big Sur Disk Utility to delete the Catalina volume group.\n\n*Boot to Catalina macOS Recovery. Use the Disk Utility to create a new APFS container partition. Enter the same name use by current Catalina. Next, use the Disk Utility to restore (replicate) Catalina to this new APFS container partition. Quit the Disk Utility and then choose →Startup Disk… from the menu bar. Choose to restart from the replicated Catalina. This would be the one that is not initially highlighted. Use the Disk Utility to erase the APFS container partition with the original Catalina. Enter a name for the new APFS volume where Big Sur will be installed. Next, quit the Disk Utility and install Big Sur to the new APFS volume you just created. If necessary, first download Big Sur from the App Store. Later, you can remove the APFS container partition with the replicated Catalina and merge the space back into the APFS container partition with Big Sur.\n\n\n\n*Any other issues?\nNo.\nHowever, user user3439894 has suggested the following popup message could be an issue. This popup may occur when booting Mojave on a Mac with Mojave and Big Sur installed in either the same or different APFS containers.\n\n", "Q: Catalina localhost ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED I have seen a number of threads that are close but no answer quite hit the mark for my issue. I have a MacOS AMP environment for testing that was setup using homebrew and that had been working swimmingly in Catalina since about January. Then about a month ago, after a \"minor\" Catalina update (and resulting crash), I got ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED when trying to access http://localhost (and 127.0.0.1 in case you are wondering about the hosts file).\nAt the time this happened, one thread I read suggested it could have something to do with the AV software. After I uninstalled the AV software, I was once again able to access localhost. Problem solved...or so I thought. Because after the latest Catalina update, I am once again not able to access. Thing is, I never reinstalled the AV program.\nThe MacOS firewall is off. Apache and PHP error logs are clear.\n$ sudo apachectl configtest\n\nReturns\n\nSyntax OK\n\nAny other ideas? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The key here is understanding the error message being generated.\n\n*\n\n*When you see a message indicating a connection was refused (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED) this means that the server actively rejected the connection attempt.  This is usually a firewall issue where the firewall rejects the packets.\n\n\n*When yo see a message indicating a time out (ERR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT) this means that your client waited for a response and nothing happened.  This could be due to the service not being up/running, or not installed.\n\n\n*Getting an result back from configtest only checks to see if your httpd.conf file is correctly formatted, not that it's doing what you want it to do.  However, your httpd.conf file has little to do with whether your connection is refused or not other than the IP and/or port it listens on.\n\n\n*Finally, http://localhost and 127.0.0.1 (your hosts file) is a DNS related, not firewall.  An error here can cause your host to be not found but not rejected.\nThings to check\nSo, unfortunately, nothing you've looked at is related to this.  What you have to look for is your firewall.  First, disable your firewall and see if it's working. Next, check your httpd.conf file for the Listen directive and make sure that is set properly.\nFor Best Results\nUnless you're hosting a website on a Mac sever (very rarely done), don't install an AMP stack on your Mac.  Instead, deploy a small VM running the OS that you'll ultimately deploy to.  This way, you can configure the AMP stack exactly for what you'll be using in production and macOS updates won't have any effect on your web server configuration.\n", "Q: Using fn+F1 and fn+F2 keys change brightness instead of being used as standard function keys When I press fn+Function key, most keys are used as standard function keys.

I'd still like my brightness keys to change the brightness, but only when fn is not pressed.\n\nA: Make sure the commands aren't duplicated in Shortcuts\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Display\n\n", "Q: Removing the “unread messages” indicator when messages were deleted by bug So, I recently experienced what seems to be quite an old bug in the default Messages app for the iPhone: while I was typing a text message, my phone’s battery died, and when the phone was powered back on, my text message history seemed to have been entirely deleted. However, there’s still the little number in a red bubble on the app’s icon indicating unread messages, which I don’t seem to be able to remove since I can’t read the deleted messages.\nIs there any way to recover the messages so that I can read them (other than using a cloud backup I haven’t made), or a way to reset the unread messages indicator to display the correct value for the messages it has access to?\n\nA: Reboot your phone.\nI discovered a solution for this one accidentally when I turned my phone off for a time, and then back on again - when it was turned back on, the list of messages was fully restored.\nIt's possible that the simplicity of fixing this issue is why Apple hasn't patched the bug in the 5+ years it's been known about.\n", "Q: Unable to delete/resize partition with DiskUtility I have a 1TB external drive with two Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partitions that I would like to merge into just one single partition. They are called Backup HD and EXT HD (see pictures). I cannot resize, nor delete, the partition Backup HD, which is empty right now. How can I do it? Why can't this be done?\nAs you see from the first picture (1), the button with - is greyed out and I cannot remove it. However, I can remove the partition EXT HD. Should I first create a new partition Untitled on the left of Backup HD (see picture 2), copy there all data from EXT HD, delete EXT HD and then resize Backup HD?\nThanks!\n\n\n\nA: The pie chart used by the Disk Utility application can give an user the impression that partitions are stored in some sort of circular fashion. Actually, partitions are store linearly. The output from the command diskutil list will shows this. Also, this output will show partitions that can be hidden when viewing the contents of a drive with the Disk Utility application. Most likely your drive is arranged with the Backup HD partition occurring before the EXT HD partition. In this case, macOS offers no effective way to merge the space from the Backup HD partition into the EXT HD partition. One solution would be to backup the data on the EXT HD partition, create one large partition, then restore from the backup.\nThere exists third party tools which can do what you are asking in your question, but before using such a tool, you should backup your data. However, once backed up there is no need to use the third party tool.\n", "Q: Does the Mac mini with M1 support the LG 5k display? I have the 1st gen LG ultrafine display. Will it work with the 2020 Mac mini M1-based machine?\nUpdate: The LG 5k 1st gen is quite prickly. It doesn't work with an AMD eGPU which does work with the 2nd gen LG. It seems to have some non-standard DisplayPort over thunderbolt implementation. This egpu.io article has details: https://egpu.io/forums/gpu-monitor-peripherals/lg-ultrafine-5k-now-usb-c-powered/\n\nA: So far, it does not. Just connected my new M1 to my LG Ultrafine 5k and it blanks out randomly despite using the same connection that works fine with my 2018 Macbook Pro and despite the M1 Mini driving a 4k VewSonic (HDMI) without any issues (which looks quite nice, but would prefer to be able to use the 5K and its built in camera.\n\nA: I have a mini M1 and an LG 4K Ultrafine.  I first connected the display with an OWC Thunderbolt cable, and had problems waking the display.  I bought an Apple Thunderbolt Cable (0.8 m) and that fixed all problems.

I considered and gave up on three providers:\n\n*\n\n*Google Calendar, because the calendar would either be public on the internet or the other person would need to set up a Google Account and link it to their device (which they are too busy to do);\n\n\n*Amazon Workmail, because the person would either need to check the calendar on the web, or link their device (again, they are too busy to do);\n\n\n*iCloud, because I would need to upload all my local calendars, which for privacy I did not want to do.\nMy solution was to export the local Calendar to an .ics file, and code a function on my NodeJS server that served that file under three conditions:\n\n*\n\n*the URL contains a secret key\n\n*the URL contains a GET parameter with a secret key\n\n*the request comes from a pre-approved IP address.\n\nAnd it works well. Here is the NodeJS code:\n/**\n *\n * GET /calendar\n *\n * URL: http://domain.com/secret1?secret2=secret2\n *\n **/\nrouter.get('/secret1', async (req, res) => {\n\n  // Access control\n  let ips = [\"\", \":::fff:127.0.0.1\"];\n  if (!(ips.includes(req.ip))) {\n    return res.redirect(\"/404\");\n  }\n  if (\"secret2\" != req.query.secret2) {\n    return res.redirect(\"/404\");\n  }\n  let filepath = path.join(__dirname, \"cal.ics\");\n  if (!fs.existsSync(filepath)) {\n    console.error(\"*** Error in serving calendar file\");\n    return res.redirect(\"/404\");\n  }\n\n  res.sendFile(filepath);\n});\n\n", "Q: Google authenticator iOS app crash / fails to load after iOS 14.2 update When I tap the app, it immediately crashes.

The size is less than one square centimeter.\n\n\n\n\nWhy does it appear on my screen? And how can I get rid of it forever?\n\nA: Since this is happening in Safari several additions could inject content that doesn’t directly come from the websites you listed:\n\n*\n\n*VPN or network injection (very unlikely as it would break most secure sites that use TLs)\n\n*Content blockers (very suspect, try disabling them all, then enabling then half at a time)\n\n*CSS modifications (less common, but very likely if you use them)\n\n*Developer tools and experimental features (Settings app > Safari > Advanced)\n\nThe developer tools and attaching your iPad to desktop safari and opening web inspector is the tool I use to dissect an odd website behavior.

I have a large .bz2 file of 18 gigabytes and there's no way it will extract on to my very small computer storage. So I got an external hard drive, copied the file to it, and pressed 'extract' expecting it to extract to the hard drive. About 1/4 the way through, it stopped because it ran out of space because it was expanding on my computer storage, not the drive's.\nI then looked at this question and tried to extract it like so but it turns out .bz2 is not .zip (obviously) so when I tried putting this command in terminal:\nunzip /Volumes/My\\ Passport\\ for\\ Mac/lichess_db_standard_rated_2020-10.pgn.bz2 -d/Volumes/My\\ Passport\\ for\\ Mac\n\nit gave me the following error:\nArchive:  /Volumes/My Passport for Mac/lichess_db_standard_rated_2020-10.pgn.bz2\n  End-of-central-directory signature not found.

And I was able to get back to work.\n\n*But later in the day — around now; 7:00pm to 8:00pm EST — I continued to get those “Installation failed: An error occurred while installing selected updates.” messages seemingly endlessly.\n\n*Frustrated again, I ran Onyx again and lo and behold… I am now downloading Big Sur; 3.25GB of 12.18GB so far with a 2 hour estimate for download.\n\nSo while I am willing to accept the idea that Apple’s servers are overwhelmed, I don’t find that to be a clear answer here. Between the Gatekeeper/OCSP issues as well as my need to run Onyx to clear caches to get the download to start again, this all points to something else happening.\nI mean at this point the canned excuse of Apple’s servers being overwhelmed to handle a planned software update seems — honestly — to be silly. Apple can cleanly get iOS updates out with little issue and streams audio and HD videos all the time. But somehow core OS updates fail like this? Nah, Apple screwed up\nAnd I am not the only one to share the opinion that the scale and demand for Big Sur cannot really be considered a factor in this; here is a take on AppleInsider about the issues that happened on November 12, 2020; bold emphasis is mine:\n\nIt wasn't about demand\nIt's also a little too easy to blame the problems on just how many people were trying to download macOS Big Sur. This was a failing, it isn't an excuse to claim Big Sur is popular.\nAgain, there aren't many companies that can push out an OS update to so many users, but this is was actually one of Apple's smaller cases.\nTrue, macOS Big Sur was a very large file to download, but according to Apple's last unit sales volume data from a few years ago, there are at least 20 iPhone users to ever one Mac owner - and this ratio has surely only increased with time. So iOS 14, for example, was a far bigger deal to distribute from a volume of data perspective.\nApple can do OS distributions at large scale. Apple has now done this many, many times. And, it does it with popular media as well — the download crushes from a new Disney movie are fairly incredible, we understand, with 4k movies of similar size as Thursday's Big Sur download.\n\nBut at least there are online communities — such as this one — where we can share experiences to move forward.\n", "Q: Will macOS Big Sur remove the default Python installation for good? I initially thought that this would happen with Catalina, but since it didn't happen a similar question is again relevant:\nMy question is two fold:\n\n*\n\n*When I eventually update to macOS Big Sur, will the Python (2.7.X) installation – which currently ships with macOS – get removed from my system?\n\n*What about if I do a fresh install; will python be gone then?\nRelevant section from macOS Catalina 10.15 Release Notes (emphasis mine):\n\nScripting Language Runtimes\nDeprecations\n\n*\n\n*Scripting language runtimes such as Python, Ruby, and Perl are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS won’t include scripting language runtimes by default, and might require you to install additional packages. If your software depends on scripting languages, it’s recommended that you bundle the runtime within the app. (49764202)\n\n*Use of Python 2.7 isn’t recommended as this version is included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS won’t include Python 2.7. Instead, it’s recommended that you run python3 from within Terminal. (51097165)\n\nSource: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-catalina-10_15-release-notes\n\nI can't find anything about this in Big Sur's release notes though.\nEdit: I am not actively using Python 2, I'm simply wondering this since it might affect some 3rd party software which relies on the OS's Python installation.\n\nA: Python 2.7 is still present on my system despite the fact that I have never installed it myself so I think that it is safe to assume that it is still present for this year.\nHowever I, like your computer, will recommend that you switch to Python 3 if at all possible because Python 2 is only included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software and is no longer being updated/supported by the Python Software Foundation.\nEdit: I know that this isn't about Big Sur anymore, but MacOS Monterey version 12.3 is removing the default python 2.7 installation. I just installed the beta and no longer have python 2 :)\n\nA: Several parts of the OS rely on python2 scripts that Apple haven't updated yet. So the 'for legacy purposes' is as much for Apple as any third-party scripts you might be running.\npython2 scripts are used for several of the Automator actions for PDF manipulation, and the xattr command, among other things.\nInterestingly, python v2 in Big Sur is a Universal Binary, so has been compiled for Apple Silicon.\npython3 is included as part of Xcode Command Line Tools: there is a little stub python3 command that tells you that you need to install Xcode (Command Line Tools) to run python3.\n\nA: No, on Apple Macs being shipped with Big Sur, Python 2 and Python 3 are both still included.\n$ which python\n/usr/bin/python\n\n$ python --version\nPython 2.7.16\n\n$ which python3\n/usr/bin/python3\n\n$ python3 --version\nPython 3.8.2\n\nThis is on an M1 Mac mini running macOS Version 11.0.1.\n\nA: No, it didn't get removed in Catalina, nor in Big Sur, and not even on the initial release of Monterey, but finally in macOS Monterey 12.3 it does get removed: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12_3-release-notes#Python\nUpdate: @Bemipefe confirmed that python did get removed even when just upgrading (and not doing a clean install) from macOS 12.2 to 12.3.\n\nA: Yes python 2 is installed on your system. A fresh install won't change this. The python-2 is write protected and probably can't be removed.  Apple use to run python 2 scripts when starting up. I suppose it still does and hence the write protection.\n", "Q: All applications cannot open unless Internet is off I'm running macOS Catalina 10.15.7 and today I have a problem with starting up programs.\nIf I try to open any application from the Dock, it'll bounce forever, and in some cases freeze the screen entirely. On the other hand, if I turn my Wi-Fi off, everything opens instantly. So the only way I was able to type this message was to turn my Wi-Fi off, open Google Chrome, and turn the Wi-Fi back on. This is completely reproducible, I have basically a clean install of the OS, and doing the typical things like clearing PRAM didn't change anything.\nThe issue is very closely tied to having Internet. For example, if I have Wifi on but the internet is not working, then everything opens fine too.\nI strongly suspect that macOS is doing something dumb, like waiting for a response from a slow server before allowing an application to open, possibly as part of its mandatory notarization. Mathematica is infamous for doing something very similar, but there's an option you can select to keep it from trying. Is there something similar for macOS?\nThis is indeed a widespread issue, currently climbing up on HN.\n\nA: This issue has now been resolved by Apple. The original post is preserved below.\n\nAs of 8 pm UTC, Apple's notary service is having 'performance' issues according to Apple's status page, which may be slow enough performance to cause timeouts or simply lock macOS trying to communicate with the service.\n\nDeveloper ID Notary Service - Performance\nToday, 8:00 PM - ongoing\nSome users are affected\nUsers may be experiencing issues with the service. We are working to resolve the problem.\n\nCurrently lots of people are installing the just-released macOS Big Sur and putting a lot of stress on Apple's servers, which may have been the cause of this issue.\nCatalina's Gatekeeper verifies notarisation on every app when launching the app. This process requires confirmation from Apple before launching the app.\nPeople on slow network connections have suffered from slow app launch since this was introduced. With Apple's servers slow due to the stress caused by everyone updating, the slowness has been moved to Apple's side, but it's still present, and exaggerated for most people.\nWith the notary service having issues, macOS is unable to contact this service. Since macOS detects a network connection, it keeps trying to communicate with the notary service, rather than giving up as it does when not connected to a network at all. When not connected to the network, macOS defers the check to next time the network is available and may still show a warning when launching apps.\nA workaround is to disable AMFI (Apple Mobile File Integrity). This should be considered a last resort, as this disables a key security check on macOS. First, disable System Integrity Protection (csrutil disable from Recovery) to be able to set NVRAM values, then run\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1\"\n\nDon't forget to set this back at some point. Reset NVRAM by holding cmd+alt+P+R on boot until the second chime (or just that key with boot-args=\"\") and re-enable SIP.\n", "Q: All notes mysteriously disappeared across all synced devices. Can I recover? All of my notes that are synced through iCloud have just disappeared across all of my synced devices. I use this application every day and would really like to get these notes back, but I can't explain how they disappeared.\nHere's what happened:\n\n*\n\n*I went to my notes app earlier today on my laptop\n\n*The notes app took a while to sync with iCloud\n\n*When it finished syncing, all my notes disappeared and there is no Recently Deleted section.\n\n*I went to my iPhone and had the same behaviour.\n\n*When I went to my iCloud account in my browser to check my notes, it was empty, too.\n\n*I went to my old laptop, disconntected it from the internet and made a backup of all the files in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.notes/Data/Library/Notes. This laptop has my notes up to early April of this year.\n\n*When I reconnected the laptop to the internet, it synced as well, and I lost everything (thought I still have the backup).\n\nSeveral questions:\n\n*\n\n*What could have happened here such that all notes were deleted?\n\n*How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\n*Is there any way of recovering these notes now? (For example, might they be in my iPhone backup?)\n\nI do use Carbonite to back up my laptop files, but ~/Library/Containers/ is not one of the folders being backed up.\n\nA: I have three questions here and I was able to figure out the two, with a guess for the first.\nWhat could have happened here such that all notes were deleted?\nI don't know exactly, but my guess is that the notes database was corrupted somehow. Most likely, the corruption happened on my phone (since I upgraded an OS patch two days ago). When my iPhone synced its corrupted database with iCloud, all notes there were deleted too. And then the corruption was passed on to my laptop. This is just a guess, though.\nHowever, it seems like others have had this problem, too.\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\nThe key thing to remember is that syncing is not a backup. If you sync corrupted or deleted data, then everything is corrupted or deleted. The most important thing to do is make sure you have backups of all your important data AND check to make sure that your backups are actually working properly.\nIn my case, the backup software on my laptop was not backing up anything in my ~/Library directory (which is where the notes archives are stored) unless I went in and changed some arcane settings. After this was done, I have this folder backing up.\nI also installed Exporter from the app store which allows you to export your notes to text. This will be another stopgap for me if this ever happens again.\nIs there any way of recovering these notes now? (For example, might they be in my iPhone backup?)\nIt turns out that yes, these notes were being backed up on my phone, but it was more complicated than just applying this backup to get the notes back. If I didn't do anything else, once the phone starts syncing with iCloud, all the backedup notes were immediately deleted because the synced notes on iCloud is \"newer\" (ie- the database corruption happened after the backup, so the corruption overwrote the notes).\nWhat I needed to do was:\n\n*\n\n*reinstate the backup\n\n*immediately put my phone into airplane mode so no syncing happened\n\n*open the notes app\n\n*move all notes to a non-synced folder outside of iCloud\n\n*take phone out of airplane mode\n\n*let the sync complete (ie- the local phone's synced folder and iCloud are now both without any notes, but the non-synced folder has all notes).\n\n*Move the notes back to the iCloud folder.\n\n*Allow sync to happen as normal.\n\nThis solved the problem.\n\nA: You may be able to recover the Notes on your Mac using the Local Snapshots. Your Mac makes a backup of your changed files every hour, even when no external drive is connected.\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder click on \"Go to Folder ...\" and go to ~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/\n\n*Select all items in that folder\n\n*Enter the TimeMachine\n\n*Navigate to a recent backup before you have lost your Notes by clicking on the layers behind the top Finder window\n\n*Click on Resotre\n\n", "Q: Big Sur: An error occurred while installing the selected updates I tried to update the macos from the 10.15.7 to the recently released Big Sur.

In my network lots of latest iOS and macOS devices.\nTo disable DoH for Firefox is used this guide Canary domain - use-application-dns.net. I search for a similar solution for Apple based devices.\n\nOperating systems Apple\nApple's iOS 14 and macOS 11 will support both DNS over HTTPS and DNS\nover TLS (DoT) when they are released in the fall of 2020.\n\n\nA: There's no similar network-wide opt-out canary domain feature for iOS and macOS in general. However, if you use for example Firefox on macOS, you can use that feature to disable it for that one browser in particular - unless the user opts-in to DoH/DoT in which case the feature does not do anything.\nYou can usually block DoT in your OpenWrt router by blocking outgoing port 853. You can usually block DoH by blocking port 443, however that would also mean blocking most web sites.\nNote that if you do block port 853 in your router, iOS will give the user a warning that encrypted DNS is being blocked by the network!\nIf there's a specific DNS server (or smaller list of servers) that you do not want to be used on your network, you can block all traffic to that IP address in your OpenWrt router. Similar warnings apply.\nFinally if you have control over the Apple devices yourself, you can use MDM to change their DNS settings. In particular you could for example enable DoH and point it to your own server - or point it to a server that doesn't exist - effectively disabling it.\n", "Q: How do I recover a MacBook Pro with a nonfunctioning screen? I have a MacBook Pro with a screen that is not functioning (always black). I have tried the following:\nTurn on normally: Touch Bar above keyboard shows escape key, brightness buttons, volume control, and nothing else.\nShift-Control-Option-Power: turns computer off; no change in status when it turns back on.\nReset PRAM using Command-Option-P-R: Also no effect. I'm not even sure I'm doing this correctly, because it says you're supposed to do it when there is a startup sound, and I am not hearing any startup sounds.\nTry to startup in safe mode by holding shift: Touch Bar above keyboard shows only escape key.\nTurn on normally and enter password: Touch Bar shows what it normally shows after logging in.\nPlug smartphone into USB port on computer: Smartphone charges normally when computer is on.\nBecause of the last two items, I suspect that the rest of the computer is working correctly and it is only the screen that has failed. Ideally I would like to get the computer working again but even if that is not possible, there is data on there that I would like to get off. What should I do now? I'm wondering if connecting an external monitor might help. Or if there's some way to see what's happening on the computer, of access the hard drive, through an external device?\n(As far as I know, nothing happened to the computer, such as a drop or spill, immediately between the last time it successfully turned on and when it started failing. But prior to the failures, I did notice a series of brighter-than-normal and darker-than-normal patches across the bottom of the display,  creating a visual effect similar to a theater curtain.)\n\nA: You could either get the screen repaired or connect it to an external monitor.\nRepairing it could cost a lot, but that would be the best solution as your Mac would be fully functional again.  Take it to an apple store or call apple and they will know what to do.\nIf you are simply looking to get your data off of it or need a temporary solution, I would highly recommend connecting it to an external monitor.  That would be the easiest way to see if the computer is fried, or if it's just the screen.

After certain actions, such as starting the screensaver and other \"innocent\" things, the system locks up for about a minute. The mouse pointer can be moved, but nothing else reacts or moves on screen. I just have to wait it out.\nLooking at the console, I can see six .crash files for tccd, with timestamps about 10 seconds apart, after each such event. The contents are like this:\nProcess:               tccd [11633]\nPath:                  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Versions/A/Resources/tccd\nIdentifier:            tccd\nVersion:               221.260.3\n\n...\n\nCrashed Thread:        1  Dispatch queue: com.apple.root.default-qos.overcommit\n\nException Type:        EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)\nException Codes:       0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000\nException Note:        EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY\n\nApplication Specific Information:\ndyld3 mode\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[NSFileManager fileSystemRepresentationWithPath:]: nil or empty path argument'\nterminating with uncaught exception of type NSException\nabort() called\n\nTo trigger the problem, it is sufficient to open the Desktop & Screensaver preferences, which shows a preview of the screensaver.\nUPDATE: Trying to choose the picture source for screensavers causes a several minutes long hang. It seems that the problem is with the screensaver trying to access data on disk. The picture source has always been set to the default though.\nI have now completely disabled the screensaver to try to avoid this problem. But unfortunately, it is sometimes (non-reproducibly) triggered by other actions as well, typically either using dictionary lookup (with \"force-click\") or using quicklook in a file-chooser dialog.

You can automate things on macOS.\nBefore you start, since you are a developer - make a time budget for things you need to do so you can learn how to automate. Then have fun learning things, the first is how to split up a project into small tasks.\n\n*\n\n*https://xkcd.com/1205/ quick estimator for time budgets\n\n*https://xkcd.com/1319/ much of what you seek could fall under continuous maintainance / ongoing development, though...\n\nHave you tried seeing how much time you can waste on containers? (jk, not really) it’s far superior to making lots of user accounts and you can’t just use virtual environments for such a wide ranging project.\n\nA: I found your question because I am interested in the same kind of thing for my own working environments. I don't have any complete answers but I have some experiences.\nOne approach that I am exploring for setting up the environment is using Keyboard Maestro, which can create scripts, simple or complex, much like AppleScript but with more features, especially including being able to find button images on the screen. It's not free ($36), but I was hooked enough by the 30-day free trial to spring for it. It allows you a wide variety of triggers to invoke scripts, from opening or closing an app to plugging in a USB device to keyboard hotkeys, text typing, or mouse gestures. There's also a very helpful user forum, which is a big plus.\nOne way that I'm using for SWITCHING defined workspaces is the free app Current Key, which lets you define hotkeys to switch between desktop workspaces. It also has some hooks with AppleScript to identify when you have manually switched desktop spaces or to programmatically move to a new space.\nI'm looking at being able to press a hotkey combination to go to a new screen and have KBM make sure that the screen is set up the way I want it to be for that project's work.\nI recently went off on a sidetrack of also wanting to modify the desktop ICONS by changing the actual Desktop file, but the only way I've found to refresh that layout is by restarting Finder and that takes too much time to invoke just when moving from one workspace to another.\nIn looking for an alternative, I found http://www.shirt-ediss.me/clarity/ which I understood to do exactly that, give different desktop icon sets and arrangements on different desktops. After testing it, I realized that it changes the whole icon arrangement for all desktops. It can let you swap between different sets of different desktop icons, each with its own arrangement.\nClarity works by moving everything out of the Desktop folder rather than replacing the whole folder, so restarting Finder is not needed. That means it gets a new set of icons (none, or restoring the original set, or whatever) fairly quickly. However, if you've hiddent everything or are using a limited Desktop contents, you might have trouble finding things that have been put aside.\nI hope these notes help you.\n\nA: Just to add my 2¢...\nEverything you listed can be scripted locally on your Mac, save one:  keep the local environment isolated\nTo do that, you need separate environments.  The best way to do this is with VMs, but instead of having a VM for each and every project, you can create a single base VM with a disk image in Multiattach Mode.\nWhat this allows you to do is create a base VM with your generic setup, then have as many VMs attach to it and they will create differencing drive images so that  each one will have it's customizations as you described but the disk size for each VM will only be the modifications you make.  The benefit here is that you can instantly clone a machine for a new project, make all your setups and when you're ready run that project you launch that VM.\nYou could do this on a MacBook Pro with a few VMs, but if you have \"hundreds\" you probably want to invest in some server grade (or workstation class) gear or even push it out to the cloud like Azure or AWS (I'm currently testing Oracle cloud and it's horrible IMO)\n\nA: Here are some specific suggestions for a subset of your asks. Note that none of these are Mac-specific, but I've used them all successfully on a Mac for years (I'm using them right now!) My gain a lot for free by being UNIX-compatible ;)\n.env files\n\n\n*\n\n*set env variables\n\n*applying git stashes with local dev connection strings\n\n\nThis is a technique for application configuration that avoids the need to dirty your source-controlled files just to make local configuration changes. A popular example is NPM's dotenv.\nThe gist is that you have one or more .env* files in your project folder that are ignored by source control. When you start your applications in development mode, they read environment variables out of these files for their configuration.

But not sure if this is the case than will I able to take the backup again that exists on iCloud ?\n\n\nA: Yes. You can erase your new phone and run the setup again. Apple cloud servers are seeing outages and general slowdowns around product launches this week so I would check them before trying a restore.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\nYou need these to be working for a restore: App Store, Apple ID, iCloud Account & Sign In, iCloud Backup, iOS Device Activation.\nOthers may be needed depending on your settings and expectations.  Your process is solid and there’s not much you can do - whatever is in iCloud is all you can get so hopefully it’s just slow internet and you don’t have to get Apple Engineering involved to look at your backup logs and perhaps fix or deliver news on what can be restored at this point.\n", "Q: Big Sur Update wiped my /etc/apache2/extra I think the title is self explanatory, but to say it again, I updated to MacOS 11 and all my extra configs of Apache decided to go bye-bye.\nTo add insult to injury, there appeared a bunch of *.conf~previous files, who are also the default settings and not mine...\nWhile it is just a  setback, and I can redo everything, does anyone have any idea of where and if I could find the old ones?\nEdit: After finishing and recovering everything, only then did I realize that macOS kept all my changes neatly in the Relocated Items on my Desktop. For anyone looking into this in the future, be sure to check if it is there...\n\nA: Just restore them from the backup you made before starting the upgrade. That's way quicker then searching for them on the upgraded system.\nOn APFS based systems, remember, your custom files and data are on the “data” filesystem and not on the system itself.\nAlso, look for a relocated items folder on your desktop in case Apple intentionally set aside your modifications.\n\nA: Apparently modified .conf files are reset to their original state not just during the initial upgrade to Big Sur but also during minor updates.\nYour modified .conf files are placed in \"Previously Relocated Items n\" subdirectories in /User/Shared.\nThis is the last line of the httpd.conf file:\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/other/*.conf\nTo keep your modified .conf files from being overwritten after each update you could put them in the \"other\" directory.  If you have more than one .conf file and there are order dependencies then put those .conf files in a subdirectory of \"other\" and include them from a .conf file in \"other\".\n", "Q: Exclude folder from sync from iCloud to device (laptop) I have many devices connected to an iCloud account, and for some devices (specifically laptops with small disks) I would like to exclude folders from sync'ing DOWN to the laptop from iCloud. I know there are solutions from excluding folders from sync'ing UP to iCloud, but I want the opposite. Is this possible (in any MacOS version)?\nAdditionally, at Apples support site \"How to free up storage space on your Mac\" it says:\n\"Files stored only in iCloud show a download icon\", but this is not true, I have folders with that icon that are stored locally on my drive, taking up huge amount of space on my Laptop with a limited size disk.\nI have the 2TB storage plan on iCloud but the typical SSD laptop disk is way smaller than this, so it seems obvious to me that I don't want the full iCloud drive sync'ed to my Laptop.\nSidenote: I'm starting to believe that my sync functionality have mucked up some way, since folders and files marked with the \"cloud\" icon is still stored on my laptop and in my Library -> Mobile Documents folder there is an iCloud Drive folder which IN-TURN contains an iCloud Drive folder.\n\nA: iCloud Drive is a syncing solution so you can't exclude folders from getting synced from the cloud onto your computer. You can have macOS manage the space on your Mac though by going to System Preferences->iCloud, clicking on \"Options\" at the end of the iCloud Drive line and selecting \"Optimize Mac storage\". This will just sync the whole folder structure without downloading the content unless you need it. Non-downloaded files/folders will show a Cloud icon in Finder.\n\nA: I have same scenario, and found this solution which worked for me..\nApparently as of Catalina 10.5 you can right-click and \"Remove Download\" to clean up your local file system,  but still keep it in iCloud to download again if needed.\nDelete a file locally, but keep it in iCloud\n", "Q: What could happen if the iMac adhesive did not seal correctly at the top of the display? I upgraded my iMac's hdd to an ssd, but the adhesive did not reseal the top of the iMac correctly. There is a gap of approximately 1mm between the chassis and the display. (The sides are fine.)\nWhat is the worst thing that could result from this gap? Should I open the iMac back up and repeat the process?\n\nA: The worst that could happen is the glass will fall out. I’ve personally seen this happen\nShould you repeat the process?  In short, yes.  You want to not only be positive that you’ve got good adhesion around the entire case, but you don’t want to leave gaps where debris, or moisture could get in.   Additionally, airflow is dependent on proper seals; an air gap could cause air to “leak” resulting in inefficient air flow and higher operating temperatures.\nThe new adhesive and your time is cheap compared to the cost of a new LCD panel.\n", "Q: What generates this message to update? I'm on macOS Catalina 10.15.7 and iOS 14.1.  This AM when I connected my iPhone to Mac, I got this pop up.  It is not something I see re: regular updates - never gotten it before.  I just X'd through it and continued as usual. I recently synced the other week with all the same software and didnt get it.  Have not made any os or ios updates or changes to warrant message.  I did use the Learn More linkbut did not get any useful info from Apple other than then saying its needed to connect - which is is NOT as i X'd through it and was able to connect.  What is it for?  Whats it mean?  Anyone else get one?\n\n\nA: Not a definitive answer, but anecdotally…\nIt's happened on every Mac here that is linked to an iOS device, on first connect after 14.1/14.2 [we held off 14 for a while]\nWhy, idk, but yes, something changed [or is about to change once you do update to 14] in the phone/pad that needs a macOS/iTunes update.\nNo Catalina here, but his happened on both High Sierra & Mojave Macs. I had assumed, prior to your question, the it was because we weren't up to date on macOS itself, but it seems not to be the case.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make a Safari window narrower than the width of all the pinned tabs? I use a lot of pinned tabs. So many that the width of all of them is greater than the screen width on my MacBook Pro.\nOn Catalina if a Safari window got larger than the screen width (typically due to using a VNC-style application on a larger screen), I could make it match the screen width instead by closing and reopening Safari. I then navigate off-screen tabs using the keyboard. This has only worked once for me so far on Big Sur – usually the window opens to at least the width of all the pinned tabs, with a portion of it off-screen.\nRegardless, sometimes I would like a Safari window to be smaller than the width of the pinned tabs, for example when taking notes on the other half of the screen.\nSo, is there any way to make the window narrower than all the pinned tabs, both in Catalina and Big Sur?\n\nA: Safari-> Preferences-> Tabs\nThen change Tab Layout from Separate to Compact\n", "Q: Can the spacing of menu bar apps be modified in Big Sur? It's much too wide, which is a problem if you use a lot of menu bar apps.\n\nA: It is the approach Apple is taking, getting the menu bar items wider. Some conspiracy theories are stating that it might be the beginning of touch screen macs since the new UI is a lot more touch friendly. You can watch \"Snazzy Labs\" video about it while Big Sur was in beta. I believer it was called \"Big Sur's Secret\" or smt...\nBack to your question, no. At this point, until a developer gets his hands on a 3rd party app or apple listens to its customers resisting the change, you cannot change any of the Big Sur spacings.\nAddition: At the time of writing this answer, there were no software capable of doing such thing. However, as the answer above me mentioned a newer version of \"Bartender\" capable of such thing. This answer is obsolete.\n\nA: Actually, there appears to be some way to do this, since the newest version of Bartender allows you to change or remove spacing in the menu bar. The app costs $15 (but offers a four-week free trial).\nTo change the spacing with Bartender, install the app, open the preferences window, and under \"General\" change \"Menu bar item spacing\" to \"Small Spacing.\" After logging out and back in (or, if that doesn’t work, rebooting), the changes should take effect.\n\nA: You can hold Cmd ⌘ and drag some of the icons to remove them to reduce the amount you have in the menubar. With some of the new additions Apple has put in, there is some redundancy and you no longer need some of them. For example - you no longer need the Sound menubar item. I know it's not a huge help - but it seems these days every little bit counts, lol..\nGood luck!\n", "Q: LG UltraFine 5K Display connected to a MacBook Pro mid 2015 - Webcam/Mic/Speaker not working I have an LG UltraFine 5K Display connected to a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015).\nI am using a Thunderbolt 2 -> 3 adaptor to connect to the monitor (and the display works just fine).\nThe issue is that my Mac doesn't seem to recognise the webcam/mic/speakers that are built into the monitor.\nDoes the Monitor support webcam/mic/speakers from a thunderbolt 2 <-> 3 adaptor? If so any suggestions as to what might be the problem here?\n\nA: \nDoes the Monitor support webcam/mic/speakers from a thunderbolt 2 <-> 3 adaptor?\n\nNo.  According to the specifications, it's a Thunderbolt 3 monitor that provides connectivity.  You need a Thunderbolt 3 port.  The adapter only allows you to convert Thunderbolt 3 to 2 or 1 but it doesn't give you any more bandwidth than what you have on your existing MacBook.\nYou have enough bandwidth to drive the display, but not enough to drive all the peripheral devices connected to it.\n", "Q: LyX start every time as a new application I use LyX and I installed last version 2.3.5.2 on macOS Catalina 10.15.7.\nWhenever I launch the application the system shows a progress bar saying 'Verifico \"Lyx.app\"...' (this is Italian, in English it should read something like 'Verifying \"Lyx.app\"...' or 'Checking \"Lyx.app\"...').\nAfter that a window pops-up saying '\"Lyx.app\" è un'applicazione scaricata da internet. Confermi di volerla aprire?' (that translated is '\"Lyx.app\" is an application downloaded from internet. Do you confirm you want to open it?'), and I answer \"yes\".\nThis behavior is OK for the first run, but it repeats every time I launch the application, and seems more a problem of macOS than a problem of Lyx. Can someone help?\n\nA: I finally realized that the folder /Applications/LyX.app/ didn't have write permissions not even for the proprietary user, differently from all other *.app folders in /Applications, so the execution of the command\nchmod +w /Applications/LyX.app\n\nsolved the problem.\n", "Q: What harm will denying ocsp.apple.com do? After the recent issue of trustd trying to connect to Apple's overloaded servers, and causing slowdowns to Macs around the world, one discussion page suggested a temporary fix:\n\nThis command in Terminal will edit your /etc/hosts file to block\nconnections to the problematic Apple server:\necho 0.0.0.0 ocsp.apple.com | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts\n\n\nIt then said \"you REALLY do not want to leave that line in /etc/hosts—it MUST come out later!\".\nDoes anyone know what the consequences might be of obstructing trustd in this way long-term?\n\nA: OCSP requests send a hash for every program you run, so that trustd can report the information (to a third-party CDN run by another company, Akamai).  The purpose is to effectively verify whether the app that is launching is notarized or not by attempting to validate any Apple-related cryptographic certificates.  With the release of macOS 11, we could no longer block certain Apple OS services with apps like Lulu and Little Snitch, as per the new restrictions to how third-party kernel extensions can function as well as to their scope of control.  This feature was then removed with the release of macOS 11.2.\nIf you always know what you're installing and you trust the processes running on your Mac, there might not be an immediate consequence of blocking the OCSP requests.  Since they require an internet connection, you could instead toggle your network connection to resolve any slow-downs the next time Apple's servers freeze up.  If you want to block the OCSP requests, your solution should work (at least for that address).  If you want to disable the service, you can try the following commands:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.revocation.plist OCSPStyle None\nsudo defaults write com.apple.security.revocation.plist OCSPStyle None\n\nI can't verify that it will make a difference, since Apple removed the conventional method to accomplish the equivalent in Keychain Access → Preferences years ago.\n\nA: The OCSP protocol is used to check whether or not a certificate has been revoked. In this context, it is used to give Apple the opportunity to revoke the “blessing” it has given to a specific piece of software. This could happen for example for example if Apple discovers that it contains malware, or when the software developer turns out to be a scammer, or similar situations.\nBlocking OCSP does not interrupt normal certificate validation. Your Mac will still be able to tell whether or not the software has at some point received the “blessing” from Apple that makes it pass validation. If you have non-signed software or software signed by someone else than Apple, this will still be picked up by the system.\nDisabling OCSP access only means that software that Apple once validated won’t be subject to checks in the future to see if Apple decided to revoke that validation.\nWhether or not that is sustainable for a longer period of time depends on your own threat assessment. For ordinary users, I would recommend not blocking OCSP, as it serves as an extra layer of protection against malicious software.\n\nA: trustd handles the validation of certificates.\nIf you permanently block this, you will block the method for validating certificates used for a number of functions within the system from  kext and app authenticity to certs in your keychain etc.\nFrom the man page\n\ntrustd provides services for evaluating trust in certificates for all processes on the system.\n\n\nA: Happend to me that this service, on slow internet connection or login-required hotspot, whe the macbook wakes from stop condition just block the keyboard and trackpad, after having successfully blacklisted on the hosts file the problem goes away... so, even it is not a ocsp server problem, this service can slow your computer a lot waiting for every single hash to be received and validated.(Macbook pro 2019 13\")\n", "Q: Printing warning: “hpPostScriptPDE.plugin” will damage your computer Network Printer: HP LaserJet Pro MFP M125ra\nAfter updating to latest Catalina MacOS / MacOS BigSur 11.0.1,\nwhen I try printing i received warning:\n\n“hpPostScriptPDE.plugin” will damage your computer.\n\n\n\nA: I had the same problem after updating to Catalina 10.15.7 on my older Mac Mini. To fix the printing warning (and allow printing) I first deleted the HP drivers and then installed new ones. My HP Color LaserJet 2025 wasn’t one of the options with the new drivers but the OS selected Laserjet CP2020 and it seems to work fine.

This created a startup error that has now forced me to reinstall my OS from Internet Recovery.\nI'm one of a number of MacBook Pro users unfortunately plagued by a longstanding issue apparently related to faulty power chips on the motherboard of my 2015 Retina MacBook Pro (most notably documented here as well as on a number of Macrumors threads and AD questions). It's my understanding that this issue affects the the 820-3662 and 820-3787 logic boards. For clarity's sake, I have methodically assessed and eliminated most other potential causes for the crashes, and when I initially diagnosed the problem, I went through all the typical steps including several fresh installs, EtreCheck, and an Apple hardware and software diagnostic (all unremarkable).\nThis problem has been reliably solved in the past by disabling several Thunderbolt-related kernel extensions on the SSV (and reportedly as well by this app, though I haven't tried it myself), which I've been doing every time I update the OS.\nProbably against my better judgment, I updated to Big Sur, and after a bit of forum trawling (I am not a developer and much of this is over my head), my understanding is that Big Sur has, in the process of becoming more secure, made it much more difficult to write the SSV.\nOn advice from several threads and blog posts, including the following:\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2020/06/25/big-surs-signed-system-volume-added-security-protection/\n\n*http://disq.us/p/2ak4vda\n\n*Mount root as writable in Big Sur\nI've done the following:\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the Terminal in Recovery Mode (reboot holding Command-R and open Terminal under Utilities in the menu bar).\n\n*mount -uw /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD (on my Mac, I understand nomenclature can vary).\n\n*Navigate to the relevant folder with cd /Systems/Library/Extensions/\n\n*Rename the relevant kernel extensions from the suffix .kext to .kext.BAK (disabling them) with mv AppleThunderboltNHI.kext AppleThunderboltNHI.kext.BAK, for example\n\n*Repeating the above with each of the relevant kernel extensions - many users have been able to get by with just disabling the above, others have had to disable nearly all thunderbolt-related kernel extensions. Fortunately I don't actually use these functions on my MacBook. The list that I used this time comes from here and includes:\n\n*\n\n*AppleThunderboltDPAdapters.kext\n\n*AppleThunderboltIP.kext\n\n*AppleThunderboltPCIAdapters.kext\n\n*AppleThunderboltEDMService.kext\n\n*AppleThunderboltUTDM.kext\n\n*and finally, the above-mentioned AppleThunderboltNHI.kext\n\n\n\n*Disabled protections with csrutil authenticated-root disable\n\n*\"Blessed\" the changes I've made in the snapshot I've been working with with sudo bless --folder /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot\n\n*Rebooted into normal mode.\n\nThus far, seems like it's working (I've had no crashes) but I'll need to use the laptop for a week or so to tell - the crashes are fairly unpredictable.\nI've posted this for two purposes:\n\n*\n\n*I hope that if this works, it's a useful resource for others that are less savvy, like myself.\n\n*As mentioned, this is well above my head and I'm hoping someone can check my work and make sure I haven't done anything completely egregious.

So the su or sudo command is not necessary since you are already using superuser privilages. Try the command ls -lah to see your permessions of the current directory. Or ls -lah whoami to see your user permissions.\n\nA: This is a very common misunderstanding and an understandably confusing situation.\n\n*\n\n*You are already root user in recovery terminal\n\n*Recovery terminal dramatically changes mounted filesystem paths ( be sure / is what you think it is before making changes)\n\n*Recovery terminal is a severely restricted shell, many commands are intentionally not available\n\nWhen you take instructions that were written for a full shell (su and sudo), they will break. This is good since you have none of the protections (guardrails) of a normal shell so the system is designed to only work with fully qualified paths to precisely the limited subset of tools that are available. Brew is designed to not even use sudo except for specific limited setup and maintenance tasks so it uses the normal shell like the normal shell uses recovery shell. You are crossing two intentionally designed abstraction barriers to ask for brew to run in recovery.\nThink of recovery terminal as a spare tire. It’s designed to get you to a service station at low speed, not to continue your race or journey. If you get an error in recovery - that error lets you know you need better instructions or to be with a mechanic that can help with your repair. Being skilled about working in a restricted shell is a specialized area and most people don’t need to spend any time learning it. This same advice applies fairly evenly for cron and other restricted tools or environments like containers.\nSo to answer your question, do not rebuild your entire tool chain in recovery, instead you can use these to restrict and encrypt your data so that someone with physical access can only destroy your data and not modify it.\n\n*\n\n*FileVault\n\n*Firmware passwords\n\n*Activation Lock\n\n\nA: The macOS recovery environment is on a separate, small partition of your startup disk, so /bin, /usr/bin, etc. are not the same folders as on your full installation of macOS.

A new version of VeraCrypt will be required which references the correct path and addresses any other issues related to Big Sur.\n\nA: Upgrading macFUSE fixed this for me\nhttps://osxfuse.github.io/2020/11/30/macFUSE-4.0.4.html\n\nA: They fixed the issue over the weekend as far as the installation of VeraCrypt but the application still complains about not finding \"OSXFuse 2.5 or above\" when trying to mount a file.\n", "Q: Get Info shows incorrect volume size for ZFS pool on MacOs Catalina I'm currently running ZFS on MacOS Catalina, version\nzfs-1.9.4-0\nzfs-kmod-1.9.4-0\n\nAfter replacing my 3TB disks with 6TB ones ZFS sees the current sizing as\n SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  CKPOINT  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP  HEALTH  ALTROOT\n5.46T  2.59T  2.87T        -         -    15%    47%  1.00x  ONLINE  -\n\nHowever Get Info on the volume shows 4.71TB with 2.97TB free. Any ideas why this is the case and should I be worried about the disparity in free space? i.e. could this cause issues down the track where the OS sees more available space than exists?\n\nA: You don't need to worry, I think.\nShort and quick explanation\n\n*\n\n*Get Info's \"Available\" is correct, but \"Capacity\" is not what you intuitively expect it be. It's actually used space + available space of the corresponding ZFS dataset (not the pool! it's the dataset inside the pool).\n\n*Moreover, Get Info uses decimal units, zfs uses binary units.\n\nA more detailed explanation follows.\nThere are two different things going on here.\nDecimal units and binary units.\nFirst of all, Finder's Get Info returns Kilobytes, Gigabytes and Terabytes in base 10 (KB, GB and TB), while command line tools such as df, zfs and zpool report values that use base 2 (KiB, Gib, TiB).\nThis means that 1GB = 1000^3 = 10^9 bytes, not the same number of bytes as 1GiB = 1024^3 = 2^30. In fact, 1GB = ~0.931GiB. Google provides a handy digital sizes converter to play with these conversions.\nThis is true of any filesystem you use on your Mac. On my system, I have a HFS+ partition. Its size is reported as such:\n\n*\n\n*60GB by Get Info;\n\n*56G by df -h.\n\nCapacity, as reported by the ZFS datasets to the OS, is not the underlying pool size, but something else.\nZFS is not just a filesystem, but a Volume Manager too. You could have any ZFS Dataset inside your pool, sharing the same available space, each consuming up a portion of it. You start with a root dataset, but you could add any number.\nWhat does your \"Get Info\" report? Hint, it's not the size of your pool, even though intuitively, you were probably expecting that. My guess is, it probably reports a number regarding your root ZFS dataset (which is not the same as your pool!), and that number should be USED bytes + AVAILABLE bytes.\nLet's check it on a real system.\nI have a pool named Tank on my system. zpool list's output is:\nNAME   SIZE  ALLOC   FREE\nTank  1.81T  1.32T   509G\n\nI have three datasets inside it: the root, Tank, and two nested datasets, Tank/DataOne and Tank/DataTwo. zfs list's output is:\nNAME           USED   AVAIL   REFER\nTank          1.32T    451G    336K\nTank/DataOne  45.9G    451G   45.8G\nTank/DataTwo  1.27T    451G   1.21T\n\nNote that I don't keep any real data inside the root dataset. USED reports all space consumed by the datasets, its snapshots, its nested datasets and their snapshots. REFER reports space used by the filesystem itself at the current time (no snapshots, no nested stuff). You can see that most of the data is in DataTwo, with 0.06TiB of snapshots too. There are finer grained options to zfs list if you want to: zfs list -o space adds also the columns USEDSNAP USEDDS USEDREFRESERV USEDCHILD).\nLet's go on and see what non-ZFS tools say. df -h output is:\nFilesystem        Size  Used Avail\n/dev/disk2s1      451G  336K  451G\nTank/DataOne      497G   46G  451G\nTank/DataTwo      1.7T  1.3T  451G\n\nGet Info says:\nName     Capacity  Available\nTank     483.81GB   483.81GB \nDataOne  533.02GB   483.81GB\nDataTwo    1.82TB   483.81GB\n\nConclusions\nYou can easily see that the values of df's \"SIZE\" and Get Info's \"Capacity\" are the same number of bytes, with different units. Rounding up the results: 483.8GB = 451GiB, 533GB = 497GiB, and 1.82TB = 1.7TiB.\nMore important, let's see if the sum of zfs's AVAIL + REFER values equals df and Get Info values, or not.\nNAME    AVAIL  + REFER\nTank     451G  +  336K = 451GiB = 483GB\nDataOne  451G  + 45.8G = 497GiB = 533GB\nDataTwo  451G  + 1.21T = 1.65TiB = 1.81TB\n\nThe last value differs slightly, but I think it's due to rounding ups here and there that skew the result. Apart from that, everything checks perfectly.\n", "Q: What is the best way to block ocsp.apple.com on mac? There seems to be some bug where mac os is constantly contacting http://ocsp.apple.com. You can prevent it by turning off the wifi, but then your computer is nothing more than a fancy calculator. Is there a program, vpn, or even the firewall option, to block this site from the whole os?\n\nA: The best way is to block it at the Internet gateway as you won't be successful blocking locally it at the machine.\nBig Sur has apparently got a new API that prevents apps like Little Snitch from blocking those connections and will even circumvent your VPN\nSource:  sneak.berlin\n\nThe version of macOS that was released today, 11.0, also known as Big Sur, has new APIs that prevent Little Snitch from working the same way. The new APIs don’t permit Little Snitch to inspect or block any OS level processes. Additionally, the new rules in macOS 11 even hobble VPNs so that Apple apps will simply bypass them.\n\nSo, if Apple makes Little Snitch useless and even bypasses your VPN to call home to report what, where, when and even how you use your Mac then the only way to do this is at the network gateway.  So, while Apple can force the machine to behave the way it wants, it still has to send packets over the network.  Block all outgoing traffic at the router to http://ocsp.apple.com and there's nothing Big Sur can do about it.\nUsing pfSense.\nI'm a big proponent of using \"commercial grade\" routers and networking gear even in the home.  pfSense makes some excellent hardware appliances but their firewall software is available for download, for free.  You just need a cheap core 2 duo PC (small form factor is best, but any desktop or tower will do), a small SSD (32GB is more than enough) and an additional NIC card (quad Ethernet cards can be had for less than $50USD).  This will give you a very efficient router using the same firewall software enterprises use.\nStep one:  Identify the IPs needed to block.  Simply pinging ocsp.apple.com will give you their IP - 17.253.13.206.  However, there are probably fallbacks so an nslookup would be advisable (nslookup ocsp.apple.com and it yields two more IPs - 17.253.13.207 and 17.253.13.201.\nStep two:  Create an alias to reference this list of hosts.  pfSense allows you to have aliases to individual hosts, a list of hosts, and even whole networks.  The benefit here is that you can write the rule once and as the networks change and evolve over time, all you have to do is edit the alias and not the rule.  Below is a screen capture of the alias configured in pfSense for all three hosts.\n\nStep 3:  Write the LAN rule to block/reject the traffic.  Simply create the LAN rule to block any connections to OCSP alias (list of hosts).  The source can (and should) be \"any,\" but you could configure this for just one Mac or any/all Macs behind the firewall.  Use both IPv4 and IPv6 to ensure all your bases are covered. Same with TCP and UDP.  Below is the rule summary screen showing this configuration.\n\nStep 4:  Apply the changes.  You may find in your testing (as I did) that nslookup didn't provide all the hosts and there's apparently a range of IPs from 17.253.13.201 through .207.  pfSense allows you to select ranges by using the syntax:  17.253.13.201 - 17.253.13.207 and it will auto generate each host.  To test, simply ping using the DNS name or any of the the IP addresses in the range.\nOptionally, you can have these attempts logged as well (you can even do this prior to blocking) so you can see every time your Mac(s) reach out and call home and using optional plugins like Snort you can capture the actual packet data and see what's being transmitted (and received).\n\nA: A quick and easy solution is to use your system's hosts file to redirect requests to localhost.\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"127.0.0.1  ocsp.apple.com\" >> /etc/hosts'\n\nThen you'll want to make sure this has been applied by clearing the DNS cache - which on the latest version is done by forcing the DNS responder to restart:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n", "Q: Mid 2014 Macbook Pro Retina - Black screen on boot, no chime I recently tried to install big sur on my macbook through a bootable USB drive. Everything went well until during the install the computer auto rebooted and showed the apple logo and load bar then went blank. I guessed the system was still installing so I waited 10 hours but still a blank screen. Now I have tried to unplug the USB and restart but the computer seems to be stuck in some kind of limbo. Here are the symptoms:\n\n*\n\n*No chime when powering on\n\n*Backlight turns on but nothing is displayed\n\n*Fan spins\n\n*Ignores closing laptop lid (Fan still runs and backlight on)\n\n*No display signal (external displays say no signal)\n\n*USB gets powered on\n\n*Cannot boot into anything (Recovery, internet recovery, verbose mode, safe mode, usb drive)\n\nI have tried:\n\n*\n\n*Resetting SMC\n\n*Resetting NVRAM\n\n*Removing battery, leaving for an hour and reconnecting.\n\n*Replacing SSD with a working SSD from an identical macbook model. (still nothing)\n\n*Removing and wiping SSD using another computer\n\n*EDIT: I tried letting the computer sit with the screen blank to drain the battery as a last resort and now it will display the red low battery graphic if I press power on. But still no boot.\nIt seems base system is missing or corrupted. I have tried everything. What do you think?\n\nA: It’s the I/o, disconnect it and it will work again. Or change the I/o board. Tried it and it worked! Good luck\n", "Q: Sound effect to confirm text is copied to clipboard How do you set a sound effect to confirm text is copied to clipboard? I am looking for my mac to make a ding whenever I copy something.\n\nA: I only know of one Clipboard manager for macOS that has the ability to play a sound when you copy/paste:  Copy 'Em for Mac ($10USD).\nTo be candid, when I was evaluating clipboard management tools, I didn't see many with this feature because it seems like it would get annoying very quickly.  Besides my extensive use of the clipboard which required me to look for a management tool (I settled on FlyCut†), having a sound every time something was sent to my clipboard - normally selecting and copy/cut, using the CLI tool pbcopy or from my password management or text expansion/replacement tools - I would imagine that my computer would sound like a telegraph operator keying out some Morse code.  You might be better served with something that gives you visual feedback rather than audible.\n\n† Flycut is an open source tool that is \"free\" though the developers do accept donations and I highly encourage folks to send them some compensation if you find their app/utility of use to you. I prefer to support this type development effort because their code is open for all to see.\n", "Q: How do you remove the clock time from the menu bar in macOS? In macOS Big Sur and Monterey, the clock in the menu bar now toggles Notification Center.\nI use iStat Menu to display the clock in the menu bar, and it looks bad having two times visible:\n\nIs there a way to re-add the dedicated Notification Center menu bar icon, as existed in Catalina and previous versions of macOS?\nHow can I remove the time and clock from the modern macOS menu bar?\n\nA: I also use (and LOVE!) iStat Menus. Best solution is to display the date with iStat and the time with the system. Decent compromise.\n\n\nA: The clock is no longer optional for Big Sur and newer macOS. It drives the do not disturb shortcut (option + select) and summons the Notification Center when selected.\nTo minimize screen area, select the analog clock icon preference for the menu bar:\n\nSystem Preferences > Dock & Menu Bar > Clock > Time Options > Analog\n\nThis is not what you want as per the title, as it removes the text of the time from the menu bar, but as per the question's description, it does set Big Sur notification to a single (clock) icon.\n\nIn terminal.app, this preference can be scripted or set from the command line:\ndefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock IsAnalog -bool true\n\n\nA: There's no way to do it now because the time serves as the button for showing the notification center and the widget view. Hope it gets fixed in the future.\n", "Q: Make the window title less chunky in big sur In Big Sur the window title bar looks too chunky in icon only mode. It looks like the bar was designed for \"Icon + Text\" but doesn't shrink when you remove the text.\nExample:\nIcon and Text:\n\nIcon only:\n\nText only:\n\nIs there a way to shrink the size of the title bar so that it doesn't look so chunky. So it looks more like this:\n\n\nA: good news, the chunky bars problem is being worked on:\nhere's MEMiniMe.\nit needs macForge, and it isn't working on mac m1 yet as far as i know, but hopefully ..soon.. we'll have a solution for these horrible fat bars.\n\nA: defaults allows you to set some \"hidden\" settings for the window style. At the moment I only found one that allows you to go back to the old toolbar style with\ndefaults write -g NSWindowSupportsAutomaticInlineTitle -bool false\n\nIf there are other NSWindow setting in Big Sur then they may be listed on macos-defaults.com in the future.\n\nA: Based on the MeMiniMe answer, i looked at the code and all it does is to use the undocumented \"setToolbarStyle\" function which is defined as normal in the Cocoa headers.\n[toolbar setDisplayMode:NSToolbarDisplayModeIconOnly];\n[window setToolbarStyle: NSWindowToolbarStyleUnifiedCompact];\n\n\nA: It is possible to use the open source app ThemeEngine to edit .car files and tweak all the UI. The V.3 branch is for macOS Big Sur and later.\nI tested it on Big Sur and an Apple M1 and, from what I can tell, every part of the theme is modifiable. colours, icons, traffic lights, size of the different UI elements, .etc.\nA short feedback report can be found here. This is screenshot of the app:\n\nThe downside is that SIP needs to be disabled, a few actions in Terminal are required and you must reboot to apply the modifications, each time. But it does work.\n", "Q: How can I program my iPhone so it opens an app automatically when it connects to CarPlay or my car’s Bluetooth How can I “program/setup” my iPhone so it opens an app automatically when it connects to CarPlay or my car’s Bluetooth?\nDoes Automator or shortcuts do that?\nIf yes, any recommendations/steps to follow?\n\nA: You need to create a Personal Automation in the Shortcuts app.\nWhen you initially create the automation, it will ask you for the condition that will cause it to launch.  There are several options like time of day, when you arrive or leave somewhere and even when something gets connected.  Select \"Bluetooth.\" (If your car supports CarPlay and you have it configured, you can select \"CarPlay\" instead)\nOnce you choose Bluetooth, you will how have the option to choose the specific device.  Select your car.\nThen you can choose your action.  If you want to open a particular app, simply click on \"Add Action,\" select \"Scripting\" and then select \"Open App.\"  Tap on the \"Choose\" link to select your app.   When finished adding your action(s), tap next to see the summary.  Tap \"Done\" when finished.\nWhen your iPhone connects to your car's Bluetooth, it will execute that action.  Keep in mind it can't differentiate when you disconnect and reconnect so if you happen to disconnect Bluetooth while driving and then reconnect it, it will launch the app again so you might want to add a simple confirmation dialog (yes/no) confirming you want to launch the app; this too can be done in \"Scripting.\"\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur version 11.0.1, no paste option in Finder I upgraded macOS yesterday to Big Sur version 11.0.1, since then there is no paste option in finder, using Cmd + V doesn't work either, just plays a sound.\nI can see that the file is copied to the clipboard, but there is no way to paste it. I spent over an hour talking to Apple support on this issue, no solution.\nI've searched online and found several posts saying to kill pboard, which I've done, still doesn't work.\nDuring the conversation with Apple we created a new account and logged in, everything works on that account, seems that my account which is the one I need is the one thats now broken.\nHas anyone got a fix for this?\n\nA: Any problem that only occurs in one user account has a standard solution:\nYour problem is caused by something in your user account. This could be:\n\n*\n\n*third-party software that is triggered to launch automatically, or something like a Finder extension.\n\n\n*A setting or preference that is wrongly configured.\n\n\n*Something else that exists inside your ~/Library folder. (the ~ sign means the current user's home)\nCheck System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items to see what is set to load at Login. It's possible that one of those might be incompatible with Big Sur and causing problems. Check for updates. Disable all of them, reboot and test the problem.\nCheck Finder Extensions in System Preferences > Extensions. Test the problem with any third-party extensions disabled. (You'll need to reboot or restart Finder, at least.)\nCheck the LaunchAgents folder in the ~/Library. This may contain scripts that trigger background apps. These may need updating. Again, remove the plist files to another location, reboot and test.\nIf none of those things work, then you'll need to 'divide and conquer'. Start removing entire folders from the ~/Library, reboot and test. If the problem is still there, replace the folder. If it goes away, restore half the contents of that folder, and test again. Gradually, you'll focus on the problem.\nLikely folders are the Preferences folder, which contains ... well, preferences; and the Containers folder, which contains individual apps' working files.\nNote that this is all in the user's Library, not the root level Library. The user's Library may be hidden in the Finder. Hold the Option key and click on the Go menu in the Finder, and Library should be a menu item.\nThings not to do:\n\n*\n\n*Don't reinstall the OS. The OS is working fine, as shown in the new user account. That will do nothing, except waste your time.\n\n\n*Don't migrate to the new user account. Changing user account can cause problems with existing file permissions. Also, if it happens again, will you keep moving on to new account after new account?\n", "Q: After updating to Big Sur the process \"opendirectoryd\" is using 70% cpu I've just updated my Macbook Air to Big Sur.\nAfter the update the process opendirectoryd is constantly using about 70% of cpu.\nI've searched for the same problem, I haven't found any Big Sur related problems.

I installed it from App Store and it's 28 gb, while my Mac only has a SSD of 128gb.\nI use vscode for all my c/c++ programs so is there a need for me to keep Xcode on my device?\n\nA: For C/++ you only need the compiler (clang)/toolchain, which can be installed via commandline:\nxcode-select --install\n\n\nA: No\nYou'd need to install Xcode only if you wish to build native apps for macOS, iOS/iPadOS, watchOS or tvOS.\nCompiling/Building C/C++ programs does not require you to have a full Xcode installation.\n\nA: You can download and install the Command Line Tools to save space. These tools are enough to compile your project to an executable binary:\n\nWhat is the Command Line Tools Package?\nThe Command Line Tools Package is a small self-contained package available for download separately from Xcode and that allows you to do command line development in macOS. It consists of the macOS SDK and command-line tools such as Clang, which are installed in the /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools directory.\n\nYou can remove the Xcode application and run the Terminal command:\n xcode-select --install\n\n", "Q: VoiceOver in macOS Big Sur echos zoom level Very frustrating change here.

I do most of the \"work\" I do on my Mac as a Standard user (Apple parlance for an unprivileged user). I also frequently use the CLI (zsh mostly now) via the Terminal app. I use MacPorts as a package manager, and various utilities such as find, rsync, launchctl, ip, mount, log, softwareupdate, etc etc etc. As it frequently happens, something I am trying to do from the CLI requires privilege elevation via the sudo command.\nHowever: According to this document, it seems that Apple does not support the use of sudo by Standard users:\n\nOnly administrator users can use sudo. If you’re not logged in as an administrator, you can do so by entering the following command, where adminUsername is the name of an administrator user:\n\n\n% su adminUsername\n\nThis seems clumsy and inconvenient: su and then sudo. It is also at odds with the way sudo works on other platforms I use. Of course macOS requires Admin user authentication to perform some tasks in the GUI, but this is generally not the way that sudo operates; i.e. any user may be granted privileges to perform specified tasks by the Admin user for the system.\nI won't ask \"why\" Apple does it this way as that can only be an opinion here, but I will ask if there is a work-around - can sudo on macOS be made to work as it does on other platforms?\n\nA: sudo on macOS does work as it does on other platforms - at least through macOS 10.15.6:\nIf you, as a \"Standard\" user, want or need privileges to perform certain tasks, those privileges may be granted by the Admin user in the sudoers file. If you are both the Admin user, and the unprivileged StandardJoe user, this becomes a bit trite, but here's how it works:\n% su AdminUser\n# authentication, and then:\nAdminuser %\n\nNow, as Adminuser, use the visudo command to edit the sudoers file:\nAdminuser % sudo visudo\n\nThis will open the sudoers file in an editor (perhaps pico). This next step is not the way things would be done on a multi-user system, but in this case as there's only one user, and we're trying to make a point, we'll abandon convention & 'throw caution to the wind' :)\nAdd the following line to the sudoers file:\nStandardJoeUser ALL = (ALL) /usr/sbin/visudo\n\nSave the file, and exit the editor. Then exit the Admin user's shell:\nAdminuser % exit\n%\n\nWhat have we just done? We have given your StandardJoeUser user permission to make any changes he wishes to the sudoers file. With that permission, you - as StandardJoeUser - can add the privileges you need - or ALL the privileges available to the Admin user if you choose.\nTo continue as StandardJoeUser, we'll now grant him the same privileges under sudo as the Admin user has:\n% sudo visudo\n# authenticate with StandardJoeUser's password\n\nAgain, the sudoers file is opened in the editor. This time, add the following line just below the one added previously:\nStandardJoeUser ALL = (ALL) ALL\n\nOnce again, save & exit. Now - StandardJoeUser can sudo anything - same as the Admin user. There is no need to change to the Admin user (su); you may sudo under your Standard user's credentials.\nDebating the wisdom of this change could be classified as opinion under SE rules, so I'll stop here. The answer to the question should be clear enough now: Yes, sudo on macOS does work the same as on other platforms; it seems the document you referenced could be classified as inaccurate under some definition of the word.\n", "Q: Does trustd leak information about users' software usage to Apple and/or third parties? When discussing a recent outage of Apple's OCSP server, people on various Twitter accounts (in the threads following this tweet) and \"fefe's blog\" claimed that the way trustd works on macOS would leak information about which software was used when to Apple and potentially to third parties as well. I always thought that trustd only sent hashes upstream and used OCSP stapling to prevent disclosing that sort of information.\nIs there any reliable information out there about the privacy implications of trustd on macOS?\n\nA: macOS (as implemented in November 2020) occasionally sends out “some opaque information about the developer certificate of apps” based on timeouts and if it detects the ability to connect to Apple servers to check for certificate revocation.\nApple has also announced some substantial improvements as a result of last week’s events. They also fixed what I termed a “rookie mistake” of inadequately documenting and committed publicly to addressing the architecture of this feature. Time will tell how fast these roll out and if the systems are more resilient without compromising agility to contain malware and react to revoked certificates.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491\n\nGatekeeper performs online checks to verify if an app contains known malware and whether the developer’s signing certificate is revoked. We have never combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices. We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are launching or running on their devices.\nThese security checks have never included the user’s Apple ID or the identity of their device. To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs.\nIn addition, over the the next year we will introduce several changes to our security checks:\n\n*\n\n*A new encrypted protocol for Developer ID certificate revocation checks\n\n*Strong protections against server failure\n\n*A new preference for users to opt out of these security protections\n\n\n\nThe best two technical write ups I have seen of what in hindsight looks like a rookie mistake by Apple about inadequate documentation on how trustd functions made a bad day much worse for Apple and people that support or use macOS.\n\n*\n\n*https://blog.jacopo.io/en/post/apple-ocsp/ (credit to Jacopo Jannone for the wording of “some opaque information”)\n\n*https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/ocsp.html\nThe best non-technical summary (but also based on technical analysis and background) is John Gruber’s summary.\n\nJust an embarrassing bug for Apple on a high-profile launch day.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/14/macos-trustd-bug\nThe failed or congested OCSP service did cause a very widespread denial of service outage on macOS client computers November 12, 2020 for more than 90 minutes.\n\nA crucial difference between OCSP and notarization is that the latter is only checked on first launch of the app. The notarization status is cached permanently and has no expiration, unlike OCSP. Thus, notarization only affects your ability to install new apps, it doesn't affect your ability to launch already installed apps.\n\nI am certain that security researchers are probing these services heavily and some will publish think pieces whether or not Apple has made mistakes. If Apple has, I expect some to collect substantial bounty by responsibly reporting if user privacy is being actively compromised.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/\n\nA: \nIs there any reliable information out there about the privacy implications of trustd on macOS?\n\nI don't think we need a deep dive into the privacy concers of what trustd does and how it does it.  If we just look at four points in  Jeffery Paul's blog (referenced in the first link - Jacopo Jannone -  supplied by bmike's answer) we can see where the privacy issues stem from:\n\n*\n\n*The OCSP requests contain date, time, location, ISP, and application hash\n\n*The OCSP requests are transmitted unencrypted.\n\n*It's hosted by a 3rd party company (Akamai)\n\n*Apple is a partner in PRISM  that grants federal police agencies warrant-less, unfettered access to this data.\n\nWhat does this tell us?\n\n*\n\n*There is a log of what application you used, when you used it and where hosted by a company that has their own privacy policy and procedures.\n\n\n*This information can be be easily obtained through a simple man-in-the-middle attack, or by the ISP (of the coffee shop you're hanging out in) simply sniffing the traffic as it passes through their network.  Even the coffee shop itself could potentially sniff this traffic!\n\n\n*PRISM access is essentially based on the  \"honor system\" that the government \"cannot\" access info on Americans without first obtaining a warrant.  However, recent history tells us otherwise.\nA knee-jerk reaction to these points would point you down a path leading to \"conspiracy theory.\"  It's not that.  It's that this information paints a picture of you and your activities and this information is not protected nor is it held on Apple's own servers - a company that loves to promote their stance on \"privacy.\"\nUsing trustd to validate certificates of apps is one thing, but the fact that a log is created and maintained of not only a users activity on their computer they supposedly own, using software they supposedly and allegedly have full rights to use but also where and when they use it is concerning.  IMO, this information shouldn't even exist in the first place.  The fact that it exists on the servers of a company users didn't directly and explicitly contract with to share this data with is beyond troubling.\nTo whom does this computer belong to anyway?  Apple, or the user?\n", "Q: How do I close a port on a Mac?

And I confirmed it and did the normal things: Safe Mode, clean caches, check the disk for errors, run the hardware diagnostics, zap the PRAM/NVRAM. The result: nothing found, still slow.\nSo time for a new Mac for her (a new MBA) and I scrub the drive on the old MBA clean of all data with disk utility, run first aid and (try to) reinstall macOS (Mojave)in the hopes that a clean reinstall will do the trick.\nInternet Recovery mode errors out when trying to install Mojave from Apple's servers (and a 30 minute boot), so I make a Mojave installer on a USB-3 flash drive and boot from that.\nIt takes almost an hour to boot the flash drive and even then the progress bar completes but nothing happens. So I built another installer and verified this one will boot an older Mac Mini I have. Works fine, but on the MBA same as before: an hour to complete booting but I never get the Install MacOS Mojave screen. It sits, completed on the black screen with a filled progress bar.\nSo Diagnostics finds nothing, disk first aid finds nothing, zapping the PRAM/NVRAM does nothing, and now I have an old MBA with no OS that won't install a new OS and stumped as to what is going on. Not sure it is worth taking to Apple for repairs as repairs would likely cost more than the Mac is worth.\nAny suggestions or even ideas what it might be?\n\nA: If your installer/boot media works fine on a different Mac but fails on your MacBook Air, the issue is likely hardware (logic board).\nYou don't need a drive to load the installer.  If you boot from USB or boot from the network (Internet), it is caching the installer in memory.  If you're to run diskutil list command while the installer is running, you'll find many \"disks\" from 0 to 20-something.  These are the RAM disks and this is normal.\nWhat you've done by booting both Internet Recovery and USB installer is bypass a potential failure point - the internal storage device.  The fact that the problem still exists  using both of those methods indicates you have logic board issue (possibly CPU or memory).  By booting from Internet, you remove both the USB bus and the internal storage from the equation.  Process of elimination says there's nothing more to bypass - the problem is with your main board.\nApple (service) isn't going to do anything that you've already done.  Apple won't repair this - they will quote you for a logic board replacement.  This normally runs about $5-700 USD.  At that price point, I'd go for a new machine.\nAlso Sell that one as salvage and recoup some money.  The screen is good, the battery, case, keyboard, trackpad, etc. can all be used for repair parts by a shop.  Even the logic board can be salvaged for individual components (the SMC chip is in high demand).\n", "Q: OSX - Not enough disk space to copy file I've been having issues with my Corsair keyboard and the first step given to me by support was to try updating the firmware. After plugging in the keyboard with the reset button held, it shows up as an external drive. When trying to copy over the firmware file using Finder, I would get an error along the lines of \"file cannot be copied because there is not enough disk space\". The file was the same size as the listed amount of free space on the external drive so I expected this to work.\n\nA: I was able to copy over the file by using the terminal. If you hit command + space and search for terminal, you will open the terminal app. There you can type ls /Volumes to list the connect devices. For me this was CRP DISABLD. Then cd into the volume cd /Volumes/CRP\\ DISABLD (use a backslash to escape any spaces). You can use tab to complete the name of the Volume if you start typing the beginning of it. Then use mv or cp to copy the file over: mv ~/Downloads/STRAGE_ISP_V205.bin . (the . means the directory you're currently in). In my case all the commands were:\n➜  ~ ls /Volumes\n➜  ~ cd /Volumes/CRP\\ DISABLD\n➜  CRP DISABLD mv ~/Downloads/STRAFE_ISP_V205.bin .\nmv: ./STRAFE_ISP_V205 (1).bin: unable to move extended attributes and ACL from /Users/monroe/Downloads/STRAFE_ISP_V205 (1).bin: No space left on device\n\nAfter moving the file over, mv showed the warning that it was unable to copy over the extended attributes and ACL from the original file.

I have noticed that sometimes when I open my laptop the battery had dropped to 99% or even 97% after a day or so.\nI have it set up to sleep after being closed for 5 seconds, and I've verified that by seeing that if it is closed for longer than five seconds I need to use touch-ID or a password to start using it.\nThere's probably a smarter way to find out or look up if/when it last entered sleep mode, but I don't know of it.\nBut sometimes while working I suddenly need to stop for hours or longer, and in some cases I am running Python from iTerm2 and have a matplotlib plot open that I don't want to close (I use widgets and it has a control panel and settings I want to continue to use later).\nAnd sometimes I notice that when I open my MacBook Air again the battery is down.\nTesting, I see that I still need to use touch ID after 5 seconds when in this state.\nQuestions:\n\n*\n\n*Could running Python and Matplotlib be keeping my computer from sleeping?\n\n*Is there some way I can find out or look up if/when it last entered sleep mode? This will be helpful in debugging of this problem.\n\n\n \nclick for full size\n\nA: \nI have noticed that sometimes when I open my laptop the battery had dropped to 99% or even 97% after a day or so.\n\nA 1 to 3% drop in battery over a 24 to 48 hour period is very normal and expected.  When you put your Mac to sleep, any processes will be suspended (provided you don't close the iTerm windows).\nThe small drop in battery is likely due to PowerNap (MacBook Air support since 2010) which will periodically wake the computer to check for email, updates, sync iCloud documents, messages, notes etc.\n\nCould running Python and Matplotlib be keeping my computer from sleeping?\n\nCould it?  Yes.  But based on the symptoms you presented, no it's not.  Your Mac wouldn't go for \"a day or two\" and only lose 1-3% charge if there was an active process preventing it from sleeping.  A super easy way to confirm this is to check the process of the script (you never mentioned what it does so my answer is generic here), if the script has finished or made progress during that time then it was obviously running.  If it's right where you left it, then your Mac was asleep.\n\n*\n\n*Do Terminal processes stop if Mac sleeps?\n\nIs there some way I can find out or look up if/when it last entered sleep mode? This will be helpful in debugging of this problem.\n\nThere's no problem to debug.\nWhat you're seeing is completely normal.  A 1-3% (average 2%) battery charge drop over \"a day or so\" is well within the norm even with PowerNap disabled.  If your Mac wasn't sleeping, your complaint would be vastly different - it would be that the battery drained completely and crashed your app/process.  To diagnose that issue, you'd issue the command\n% pmset -g assertions\n\nThat will tell you what's preventing your Mac from sleeping.  It should return zeros.\nThe other reason why \"a problem\" shouldn't be assumed is that there's a very important distinction between sleep and hibernation.  When your Mac sleeps, the CPU goes into a lower power mode (not off) and the current state is held in memory (there's a lot more, but let's limit it to these major functions).  This means there is a power draw.  If you want to stop the power draw (technically you can't completely stop a battery from discharging due to physics and chemistry governing the battery), you have to hibernate your computer.  This is where the state will be written to disk and the power turned off.\nNow, to see when your Mac went to sleep, you can obtain the log from pmset as well:\n% pmset -g log | grep -i \"sleep\\|wake\" \n\nThe problem with this is that with the newer versions of macOS, the computer will still wake for arbitrary reasons even with PowerNap disabled.  I know this because I can hear a bar code scanner \"reset\" (it makes a tone when connected to USB) periodically even though I have the Mac  sleeping with PowerNap disabled.  For some reason, it resets the USB bus.  I haven't investigated this more because a) it happens on every Mac I've used and b) the Mac has never had any ill effects when woken.  All processes were suspended as they were supposed to.\nBy limiting the scope of symptoms to the drop in battery charge over a period of days, you'll end up looking for solution to a non-problem.\n", "Q: Can iPhone 12 be used safely in pouring rain? After some googling, I see many articles on circumstances where an iPhone can be used, but none that say definitely that is perfectly okay to actually do so (or whether it's risky to do so). Also problematic is that most of the top google results come from news paper websites, which are not technical in nature, and therefore not the best sources of such specific questions, and often word sentences to avoid committing to any specifics (and worse, some are speculative i.e. written before the details were released by apple!).\nQuestion: if it's pouring rain and you're going out into it, can you continue a phone conversation while walking in that rain?\nAssumptions\n\n*\n\n*That the device should be thoroughly dried afterward before charging or using any any peripherals\n\nIf your iPhone has been exposed to liquid, unplug all cables and do not charge your device until it’s completely dry ..  allow at least 5 hours\n\n\n*\n\n*That the rain is falling like normal (i.e. it is not pressurised)\n\n\nTo prevent liquid damage, avoid .. pressurised water or high-velocity water, such as when showering, water skiing, wakeboarding, surfing, jet skiing and so on\n\n\nA: According to the Technical Specifications of the iPhone 12, the splash, water, and dust resistance is rated as follows:\n\nRated IP68 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes) under IEC standard 60529\n\n(I picked the minimum ratings - iPhone 12 as a baseline)\nWhat does this mean?\nIP68 ratings means the following:\n\n*\n\n*The first digit, 6:  Protection from contact with harmful dust\n\n*The second digit, 8: Protected from immersion in water with a depth of more than 1 meter (manufacturer must specify exact depth)\n\nFor dirt and debris, this means that some dust that's kicked up from a gust of wind is fine.  Going through a sand storm in the desert is not.  As for water, this means you can safely submerge your phone in water about 18 feet deep (deep end of a pool) for about 30 mins (10 mins longer than the 20 required for you to stay out after you eat).\nCan you go swimming with it? Not really. These ratings are for water and it doesn't cover chemicals like chlorine or the salinity of ocean water. Can you drop it in your tankard of ale? Nope. It's not certified for booze.\nCan you use it in the shower? It depends, if it's just the standard (builder) shower head that you get \"with the house\" you're probably fine.  If it's a fancy massaging shower head that pressurizes the water with those oh, so pleasing pulsing jets of water, then no.\nAs for a rain storm, if you get wet while in a light to moderate shower, you should be fine. But if you're thinking of continuing your conversation in an all day downpour or while you report on a hurricane/tropical storm making landfall, then no, it won't survive. Remember, even submerged, there's a maximum amount of time it can stay submerged.\nTL;DR\nIt's water resistant not water proof. Apple's technical specifications tells us exactly what the resistance levels to dust and water are. If you happen to get wet (in the rain) while using your phone, you should be fine. They tell you how to dry it off and how long to do so before charging because water conducts electricity. This is to prevent short circuits when connecting up to 20V to your phone.\nBesides, talking in a heavy downpour is logistically next to impossible. It's loud - the person on the other end will have difficulty hearing you as you will with your caller. As a resident of Florida, I can attest that a severe downpour while sheltered is still very difficult to hold a conversation.\nIf you're using the phone in the shower....that's a whole different conversation for a different Stack Exchange site.\n\nA: Yes. Use any IP68 rated iPhones in the rain, it’s safe to you and low risk to a new / undamaged phone.\n\n*\n\n*I sure wouldn’t charge it until it’s good and surface dry and I would use wireless charging until you’re sure the lightning connector is thoroughly air dried without heat.\n\n*Use it all you want, keep it as dry as reasonably possible and once you drop it (in a case or not in a case), you could be breaking the seal that makes it water resistant.\n\n*I prefer to use my watch and AirPods when it’s really wet and keep my phone safely sealed in a pocket or cheap barrier.\n\nI like the clear pouches from REI over the hard shells, but whatever floats your boat....\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur Dictionary.app doesn't use system proxy When using Wikipedia in Dictionary.app on macOS Big Sur 11.0.1, Dictionary.app sends HTTPS requests to *.b.akamaiedge.net and is not utilizing system proxy (HTTP or socks5). How do I fix this?\n\nA: This phenomenon is not unique to Big Sur—it likely dates back to when the Dictionary application was first introduced in Tiger. @1110101001 did some reverse engineering to figure out what's going on.\nDictionaryServices.framework makes network connections via the now-deprecated CFHTTPStream. According to an Apple engineer and Apple's own code, any software which uses CFHTTPStream will ignore the system's proxy settings, unless the developer goes out of their way to add a few extra lines of code.\nTo fix this problem, we'll need to inject some code which does what the original developers did not—tell the app to apply the system's proxy settings before running CFHTTPStream.\nFirst, compile the following code (e.g. clang -framework AppKit -framework Foundation -o ProxyFix.dylib -dynamiclib /path/to/code.m) to create a library we can inject. This was also mostly written by 1110101001; I tweaked it to work with apps that use two-level namespaces.\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <objc/runtime.h>\n#include <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n#include <dlfcn.h>\n#include <AppKit/AppKit.h>\n\n#define DYLD_INTERPOSE(_replacement,_replacee) \\\n    __attribute__((used)) static struct{ const void* replacement; const void* replacee; } _interpose_##_replacee \\\n                __attribute__ ((section (\"__DATA,__interpose\"))) = { (const void*)(unsigned long)&_replacement, (const void*)(unsigned long)&_replacee };\n\nCFReadStreamRef myCFReadStreamCreateForHTTPRequest(CFAllocatorRef alloc, CFHTTPMessageRef request) {\n    printf(\"Injected ProxyFix!\\n\");\n    CFReadStreamRef ref = CFReadStreamCreateForHTTPRequest(alloc, request);\n    CFDictionaryRef systemProxyDict = CFNetworkCopySystemProxySettings();\n    CFReadStreamSetProperty(ref, kCFStreamPropertyHTTPProxy, systemProxyDict);\n    return ref;\n}\n\nDYLD_INTERPOSE(myCFReadStreamCreateForHTTPRequest, CFReadStreamCreateForHTTPRequest);\n\nWe now need to insert this library into the Dictionary application. Luckily, macOS comes with a built-in mechanism for injecting code in the form of DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES. If you, like me, are running an ancient and lovably-hackable version of macOS such as 10.9, all you need to do is run your app after setting this environmental variable. For example, run in Terminal:\nDYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/path/to/ProxyFix.dylib /Applications/Dictionary.app/Contents/MacOS/Dictionary\n\nIf you're running macOS 10.6 or below, or if the application isn't code signed (possibly because you removed the code signature via optool or similar), you can also add this environment variable to the app's Info.plist, so that the library is injected automatically.\ndefaults write /Applications/Dictionary.app/Contents/Info LSEnvironment -dict DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES @executable_path/../Frameworks/ProxyFix.dylib\n\nUnfortunately, newer versions of macOS have additional security features to prevent code injection. Starting with 10.11, you will need to disable System Integrity Protection in order to use DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES. On the newest OS's such as Big Sur, you may (or may not) need to take further steps as well, such as disabling AMFI—I'm not entirely familiar with all of the new security checks Apple has layered on in recent years.\n\nP.S.

Do I need to wory? One of my company computers - a Macbook Air, was shown to have security vulnerability as part of a recent external network scan.\nThe issues are related to Linux 4.0. Mac OS is a UNIX flavor, not Linux (FYI - I'm not an expert at all!!). I'm wondering if these vulnerabilities are perhaps related to the router connecting the computer to the internet? Maybe the router is running on Linux?\nThese are the issues:\n\n*\n\n*CVE-2015-8830: https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2015-8830.html\n\n*CVE-2018-10938: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10938\n\n*CVE-2017-7273: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7273\nIs there a way to patch/fix these issues? I upgraded to Big Sur, yet the vulnerabilities remain.\n\nA: Rather than fight your security team or do their job I suggest you turn on your firewall and block all traffic, and ask them to rescan. That should fix their bad detection problem. Unless you’re running docker or another actual Linux VM, their fingerprint detection is incorrect or the scan isn’t of your machine. I would even offer to connect to their network with VPN so they can be sure they are scanning your hardware directly and not some NAT device or router between you and them.\n\n*\n\n*How do I close a port on a Mac?\nAlso, don’t blame security too hard - this security theater happens in most organizations. They likely didn’t even bother to check your network address and could be blaming you for the last person to be assigned that DHCP address on your network. They are likely as under funded, over worked as you are. However, security is something you’d hate to not do your part so engage them to be sure they are correctly mitigating the threats they received - if it’s not you, they need to focus their efforts eleswhere as something they scanned needs patching.\nAlso, if they continue to pester you, figure out how much you value your time and buy this firewall so you can confirm they are scanning your device.\n\n*\n\n*https://obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html\nI think just running little snitch is one of the most effective deterrents in a corporate setting as much malware checks for it.

June 5, 2007\nOrder MA609LL\nModel A1211 (EMC 2120)\nFamily Core 2 Duo/Late 2006\nID MacBookPro2,2\nRAM 1 GB (upgraded to 3GB)\nVRAM 128 MB\nOn this machine, there is no Mac OS X anymore.\n(I have the original install DVD + DVD Leopard + Snow Leopard.)\nInstead there is Debian 10.6 that I can use through command line only (TTY)\nI would like to install Windows 10:\n\n*\n\n*via a USB bootable (my preference)\n\n*or via bootable DVD\n\nGRUB is installed and works - I can not use rEFInd for technical reasons. I can not use BootCamp as there is no Mac OS X on it.\nTo install Windows 10 on this MacBook Pro, I was thinking booting with bootable device and install from Grub.\nI also have an old PC with Windows 10 installed and an new external DVD writer.\nWhat are my options?\n\nA: One technical reason you can not use rEFInd is that rEFInd is a boot manager. To boot Windows you need a boot loader. The rEFInd boot manager instructs the firmware which file or data to boot from. The actual booting is not done by rEFInd.\nGrub is a boot loader. Grub may be able to boot Windows. However, Windows on your model Mac needs to interact with a functioning BIOS. No BIOS means no successful booting of Windows.\nInstalling 64 Bit BIOS Booting Windows 10\n\nThis installation method does not require OS X (macOS) to be installed on the Mac. However, the assumption has been made that the firmware is capable of BIOS booting and the processors are Intel with 64 bit cores.\n\nAn improved method of installing Windows 10 can be found here. This improved method does not require the use of the optical drive on the Mac.\nMany early 64 bit Intel Mac models contained firmware which prevented BIOS booting from 64 bit Windows installer DVDs. Here, I will assume your Mac is one such model. This installation guide will explain how to use Grub to BIOS boot the 64 bit Windows 10 installation software.\nCanonical explicitly developed a 64 bit version of Ubuntu for Macs of your vintage. Specifically, Macs with the following characteristics.\n\n*\n\n*Use Intel processors with 64 bit cores.\n\n*Can not boot from optical media with multi‑boot boot entries.\n\nThis Ubuntu would install with a BIOS booting GRUB that could boot a 64 bit Ubuntu. Installers using this arrangement ended with Ubuntu 14. The memory requirements for Ubuntu 14 are under 3 GB. So, one possible strategy would be the following.\n\nInstall a BIOS booting 64 bit Ubuntu 14 Server, then use the included Grub to BIOS boot the current 64 bit Windows 10 installer. The installation of the BIOS booting 64 bit Windows 10 will replace Grub and Ubuntu 14 Server.\n\nHere are the steps for implementing this strategy.\n\n*\n\n*Download a BIOS booting 64 bit Ubuntu 14 Server ISO file. In this example, the file ubuntu-14.04.6-server-amd64+mac.iso was downloaded.\n\n\n*Burn the ISO file to a DVD. I used a reusable RW DVD.\n\n\n*BIOS boot from the DVD. Start up your Mac and immediately hold down the option key until the Mac Startup Manager icons appear. Insert the DVD and select to boot from the DVD icon with the label Windows.\n\n\n*Install Ubuntu Server. When an image similar to the one shown below appears, you can choose for the installer to add the parameter nomodeset to the linux command line. This can be accomplished by pressing F6 and selecting nomodeset from the menu. With Install Ubuntu Server highlighted, press return to continue.\n\nIf you internal drive already has mountable partitions, then an image similar to the one shown below may appear. If so, then select Yes.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select Manual.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select the line containing (sda).\n\nNote: The existing partitions shown depend on how the disk was previously partitioned. Below is a example. Your disk will probably show different partitions.\n\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select Yes.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select the line containing FREE SPACE.\n\nHere you want to create a new primary partition at the beginning of the available space. When asked for a size, enter a new smaller size value. This value can be determined by subtracting 16 GB and the desire size of the swap space from the value shown. For this example, the desired size of the swap space was chosen to be 6 GB. Since the initial size was 137.4 GB, a new size of 115.4 GB was entered. The size value you will enter most likely will be different. Configure the rest of the partition settings as shown below, then select Done setting up the partition.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select the line containing FREE SPACE.\n\nHere you want to create a new logical partition at the end of the available space. When asked for a size, enter the desired size of the swap space. For this example, the value was already stated to be 6 GB. You should enter the value you have already determined. Configure the rest of the partition setting as shown below, then select Done setting up the partition.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select the line containing FREE SPACE.\n\nHere you want to create a new primary partition from the available space. When asked for a size, do not change the value shown. Configure the rest of the partition setting as shown below, then select Done setting up the partition.\n\nFor this example, the result is shown below. Select Finish partitioning and write changes to disk.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select Yes.\n\nIf an image similar to the one shown below appears, select Yes.\n\nFinish installing Ubuntu.\n\n\n*Create a NTFS volume on the unused internal drive partition /dev/sda3. Since the new volume will be NTFS formatted, the MBR partition type needs be changed from from 83h to 07h. To make the change, first enter the interactive command given below.\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\nNext, enter the following commands to change the MBR partition type.\nt\n3\n7\nw\n\nFinally, enter the following command to restart the Mac.\nsudo reboot\n\nEnter the following command to NTFS format /dev/sda3.\nsudo mkfs.ntfs -L WINSTALL -Q /dev/sda3\n\n\n\n*Install ExFAT filesystem support. Enter the following commands.\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install exfat-fuse exfat-utils\n\n\n\n*Locate block devices for the internal HDD and the desired 64 bit Windows 10 installation ISO file. In this example, the file Win10_20H2_English_x64.iso exists on a ExFAT formatted flash drive. Plug the flash drive into the machine. The lsblk command can be used to list all block devices. For this example, the output from this command is given below. Since the swap is block device sda5, the internal HDD is block device sda. Since the flash drive is approximately 16 GB in size, the block device an be determined to be sdb1.\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0   128G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0 107.5G  0 part /\n├─sda2   8:2    0     1K  0 part \n├─sda3   8:3    0    15G  0 part \n└─sda5   8:5    0   5.6G  0 part [SWAP]\nsdb      8:16   0  16.6G  0 disk \n└─sdb1   8:17   0  16.6G  0 part \nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom  \n\nIf your determined different block devices, then make the appropriate substitutions in the following commands.\n\n\n*Transfer the Windows 10 installation files from the ISO file to a volume on the internal drive. In this example, the following commands were used. Basically, you mount, copy and unmount.\n\nNote: The boot.wim and install.wim files are very large and therefore may take a long time to copy.\n\ncd ~\nmkdir winstall iso flashdrive\nsudo mount -t exfat /dev/sdb1 flashdrive\nsudo mount -t udf -o ro,nosuid,nodev flashdrive/Win10_20H2_English_x64.iso iso\nsudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda3 winstall\ncp -Rv iso/* winstall\nsudo umount winstall iso flashdrive\nrmdir winstall iso flashdrive\n\n\n\n*Use Grub to boot the Windows 10 installer stored on the internal drive. Enter the command below to turn off the Mac.\nsudo shutdown -P now\n\nRemove the flash drive. Start the Mac. When the window shown in the image below appears, press the C key.\n\nWhen the window shown in the image below appears, enter the following commands. This will boot the Windows 10 installer.\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ntfs\ninsmod ntldr\nset root='(hd0,msdos3)'\nntldr /bootmgr\nboot\n\n\nProceed with the installation of Windows 10.\n\n\n*Create the partition for Windows 10. When you reach the window shown in the image below, select Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).\n\nWhen the window shown in the image below appears,  leave Drive 0 Partition 1 highlighted and click on the Delete button. Next, click on the OK button in the popup window.\n\nWhen the window shown in the image below appears, leave Drive 0 Unallocated Space highlighted and click on the Next button.\n\nProceed with the installation of Windows 10.\n\n\n*Install the Boot Camp Support Software (Windows Support Software). The Boot Camp Support Software is on the Snow Leopard installation DVD. The files can be accessed from Windows. Officially, only 32 bit versions of Windows can be installed on your Mac. Since I do not have your model Mac, I can not predict how difficult it will be to the adapt the software for use with a 64 bit Windows. You should consult lx07's answer for more information.\nA Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) ISO file can be downloaded from the website Mac OS X Snow Leopard Install DVD. You should verify the download by computing the SHA256 hash value. The Get-FileHash Power Shell cmdlet can be used to compute a SHA256 hash value. Entering Get-FileHash along with the path to the downloaded file in a Power Shell window should produce the following SHA256 hash value.\nCBEEB2378C40B20A9B06236F567DE593E9030A0A865515B50CF6D35833E25CD5\n\nUnder Windows 10, the Boot Camp Support Software can be accessed by mounting this ISO file.\n\n\n*Remove unnecessary partitions and extend the Windows 10 partition. Boot to Windows 10 desktop. Next, right click on the Start button and select Disk Management. A windows similar to the one shown below will appear.\n\nRight click on the last partition shown for Disk 0. Select Delete Volume…, as shown below. In the popup window, click on the Yes button.\n\nRight click on the free space shown for Disk 0. Select Delete Partition…. In the popup window, click on the Yes button.\n\nRight click on the partition with the volume label WINSTALL. Select Delete Volume…. In the popup window, click on the Yes button.\n\nRight click on the partition with the drive letter C:. Select Extend Volume…. In the popup window, click on the Next button. Again, in the next popup window, click on the Next button. In the next popup window, click on the Finish button.\n\nThe result is shown below.\n\nExit the Disk Management application.\nAn Alternative: Installing Xubuntu\n\nNote: I have no way to verify if these instructions will work for your model Mac. Based on the problems posted regarding the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics processor, I suspect these instructions will not result in a successful installation. Although, the problems seem to be associated with EFI booting and here only BIOS booting is employed. Even if the instructions do not work for your model Mac, users with a different model Mac may find the instructions useful.\n\nFirst complete steps 1 through 4 outlined in the section titled \"Installing 64 Bit BIOS Booting Windows 10\".\n\n*\n\n*Locate block devices for the internal HDD and the desired 64 bit Xubuntu installation ISO file. In this example, the file xubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso exists on a FAT32 formatted flash drive. Plug the flash drive into the machine. The lsblk command can be used to list all block devices. For this example, the output from this command is given below. Since the swap is block device sda5, the internal HDD is block device sda. Since the flash drive is approximately 16 GB in size, the block device an be determined to be sdb1.\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0   128G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0 107.5G  0 part /\n├─sda2   8:2    0     1K  0 part \n├─sda3   8:3    0    15G  0 part \n└─sda5   8:5    0   5.6G  0 part [SWAP]\nsdb      8:16   0  16.6G  0 disk \n└─sdb1   8:17   0  16.6G  0 part \nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom  \n\nIf your determined different block devices, then make the appropriate substitutions in the following commands.\n\n\n*Transfer the Xbuntu installation ISO file to the unused partition on the internal drive. In this example, the following commands were used. Basically, you mount, copy and unmount.\n\nNote: The xubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso file is very large and therefore may take a long time to copy.\n\ncd ~\nmkdir flashdrive\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 flashdrive\nsudo dd if=flashdrive/xubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sda3 bs=1M\nsudo umount flashdrive\nrmdir flashdrive\n\n\n\n*Use Grub to boot the Xubuntu installer stored on the internal drive. Enter the command below to turn off the Mac.\nsudo shutdown -P now\n\nRemove the flash drive. Start the Mac. When the window shown in the image below appears, press the C key.\n\nWhen the window shown in the image below appears, enter the following commands. This will boot the Xubuntu installer to a live version of Xubuntu.\ninsmod iso9660\nset root=(hd0,msdos3)\nlinux /casper/vmlinuz\ninitrd /casper/initrd\nboot\n\n\n\n\n*Install Xubuntu. The Xubuntu live desktop will appear as shown in the image below. To start installing Xubuntu, double click on the icon labeled Install Xubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.\n\nProceed with the installation of Xubuntu. For a brief moment during the installation, the following screen will appear with a warning message.\n\nThe above screen will quickly be replaced by the screen shown below. Here the same warning message appears, but is partially covered.\n\n\nThe intent is to install to the existing partition /dev/sda1.\n\nHighlight the /dev/sda1 device, then click on the Change button. In the popup window, do not change the size value. Configure the rest of the controls as shown below, then click on the OK button.\n\nFor this example, the result is shown below.\n\nClick on the Install Now button, then click on the Continue button in the popup window. Continue installing Xubuntu. When the screen below appears, click on the Restart Now button.\n\n\n\n*Remove the unnecessary partition and extend the Xubuntu partition.

I clean installed Windows 10 Technical Preview in 2014 (without earlier Windows version) and have been upgrading it since to version 1909 currently.\nTo install Windows you need to ensure the disk is partitioned correctly (with hybrid MBR), somehow get the Windows files onto the disk and then install drivers.  You can not use a USB installer - your options are either to use a DVD, a VM or to remove the disk and install using another PC.\nI'd suggest considering upgrading to a SSD (I paid €40 for a 120GB but it seems they are around €20 now) and installing Windows on it before putting it the MBP if you have access to another computer.  This will kill two birds with one stone - you get much better performance and easier installation.\nPerformance will still not be great though - it is fine for basic web or MS Office tasks but I find it overheats when running Skype or YouTube.  I also have Linux and OSX (Lion and El Capitan) installed and performance is similar but Windows runs cooler (I do use Throttlestop to undervolt the CPU which helps).\n\nPartitioning\nYou need a hybrid MBR to boot in legacy BIOS mode.  This can be created manually using gdisk from Windows/Linux or macOS.  It is described in the documentation but this is mine as an example (I have a couple of small OSX GPT partitions after the MBR limit of 4).\nPS C:\\> .\\gdisk64.exe \\\\.\\physicaldrive0\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.3\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: hybrid\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with hybrid MBR; using GPT.\n\nCommand (? for help): r\n\nRecovery/transformation command (? for help): o\n\nDisk size is 250069680 sectors (119.2 GiB)\nMBR disk identifier: 0xEBD711AE\nMBR partitions:\n\nNumber  Boot  Start Sector   End Sector   Status      Code\n   1                     1       409639   primary     0xEE\n   2      *         409640    172376718   primary     0x07\n   3             172378112    180766719   primary     0x27\n   4             180766720    201738239   primary     0x83\n\nRecovery/transformation command (? for help): p\nDisk \\\\.\\physicaldrive0: 250069680 sectors, 119.2 GiB\nSector size (logical): 512 bytes\nDisk identifier (GUID): 569B72DC-B014-4DD3-B28A-A95CA047CBEE\nPartition table holds up to 128 entries\nMain partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 33\nFirst usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 250069646\nPartitions will be aligned on 8-sector boundaries\nTotal free space is 525694 sectors (256.7 MiB)\n\nNumber  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name\n   1              40          409639   200.0 MiB   EF00  EFI System\n   2          409640       172376718   82.0 GiB    0700  MacWindows\n   3       172378112       180766719   4.0 GiB     2700  Recovery\n   4       180766720       201738239   10.0 GiB    8300  Arch\n   5       201738240       222447615   9.9 GiB     AF00  macOS2\n   6       222709760       249807495   12.9 GiB    AF00  macOS\n\nRecovery/transformation command (? for help):\n\n\nGetting Windows onto the disk\nYour mac will not boot non OSX installers from USB.  You can see this with rEFInd - it will identify USB installer but if you try to load it you get the error message:\n\nThe firmware refused to boot from the selected volume. Note that external hard drives are not well-supported by Apple's firmware for legacy OS booting\n\nThere are three options I can think of to get Windows onto the disk.\n\n*\n\n*Burn Windows installer ISO to DVD and boot from that if your superdrive works.  Mine doesn't (as is common on these old MacBooks) but this sounds the easiest.\n\n\n*Create a virtual machine and access the disk using raw disk access.  There are various guides for this (see Native Install Windows 10 on mac pro 1.1 / 2.1 without usb or dvd or bootcamp).  This method is fairly straightforward but you need to install an OS first.\n\n\n*Open the MBP, remove the disk and install using a Windows PC.  There are numerous guides for installing Windows on either internal or external drives so I'll not duplicate it here as it isn't mac specific.  Just make sure to install in legacy BIOS/CSM mode or apply image using dism to disk you partition and format yourself.  Power off when it gets to first reboot (or after applying image). Check partitioning (both GPT and MBR partition schemes created) then remove disk, replace it in the mac and it will boot up fine (at least in my case).  If using SSD you should patch the mbr before first boot as it is inconvenient to change to AHCI mode later - see below.\nDrivers\nAfter booting into Windows install bootcamp drivers - any version of bootcamp will do as the main reason is to get right click working on the touchpad. I used version 5.1 as that was then current but I don't think it matters much. See @David Andersons answer to Using Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033 to install 64 bit Windows 7, 8 or 10 for installation instructions.\nIf there are missing drivers most you will find through Windows update.  The only two I had to deal with manually were these:\n\n*\n\n*Radeon driver can be found from https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=X1600 I use the Windows 7 one and it works well.\n\n\n*Sigtel driver can be found in Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033.\nInstall these through device manager - browse to top folder and install - for example:\n\nAdditional steps for SSD\nFor SSD you need to patch first track of mbr as Apple disables AHCI mode.  You can find details here [HOWTO] Boot Macs with Intel Chipset in AHCI Win7 Vista XP Linux\n\nCopy the patchedcode.bin to a USB stick\nBoot with MacOSX Setup CD (or Ubuntu Live CD or anything else where you can write the MBR to the disk)\nIMPORTANT: Make a backup of your mbr first: dd if=/dev/disk0 of=backup.bin bs=512 count=1\nUnmount all mapped drives from your disk0: umount /dev/disk0s1, umount /dev/disk0s2, etc.\nWrite the new mbr: dd if=patchedcode.bin of=/dev/disk0 bs=440 count=1\n\nYou can find the required patchedcode.bin file here (If the link goes dead google \"AHCI patchedcode.bin\").\nWith this disk performance is not too bad - it is close to 150 MB/s SATA 1 limit.\n\nBoot manager\nA slight aside as you don't need it to boot Windows but you mentioned boot managers. You have 32 bit EFI so the firmware will only call a 32 bit EFI executable. This doesn't mean that you can't run 64 bit OS though.\nI use rEFInd as I find it is convenient - it will automatically find OSX and both legacy and EFI Windows installations and start them. Note you need legacy Windows with hybrid MBR partitioning scheme for this MBP, EFI installation is for more recent models. If you want a 64 bit linux you can chainload grubia32.efi (which is created by specifying --target=i386-efi on grub-install ) or Syslinux both of which rEFInd will also find automatically.\nYou can install rEFInd manually by simply copying the files to the EFI partition and then setting the path to the .efi executable in NVRAM using bless, efibootmgr or bcdedit (depending on OS) as described in the documentation.\n\nA: The press release Apple Introduces Boot Camp indicates Boot Camp was officially introduced with the release of OS X 10.5 (Leopard). You Mac model was originally shipped with OS X 10.4.8 (Tiger). This is why I think your Mac may not have the updated firmware to BIOS boot operating systems such as Windows. You can determine your current firmware version and apply updates by installing OS X. See About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers for available downloads.\n\nNote: With recent releases of macOS, firmware update are include in the macOS installation software. However, this type of firmware updating did not exist for any version of OS X officially supported for your Mac.\n\nOn page 5 of Apple's Setting Up Boot Camp (copyright 2010), you can read the following.\n\nYou can use a 32-bit version of Windows XP or Windows Vista with any Intel-based Mac computer.\nYou cannot use a 64-bit version of Windows XP on any Mac computer.\nYou can use a 32-bit version of Windows 7 with any of these Mac computers:\n•  An iMac or MacBook Pro introduced in 2007 or later\n•  Any Intel-based Mac Pro, MacBook, or Mac mini\nYou can use a 64-bit version of Windows Vista or Windows 7 with any of these Mac computers:\n•  A Mac Pro or MacBook Pro introduced in early 2008 or later\n•  An iMac or MacBook introduced in late 2009 or later\n\nSo officially, you can not install Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10. Upgrading from a previous version may be possible. Also officially, you can not install a 64 bit Windows. Upgrading from 32 bit to 64 bit is not possible with Windows.\nSince the Boot Camp Support Software is not available for download for your model Mac, you will have to get the software from an OS X installation DVD.\n\nBe aware, that if you view a Snow Leopard DVD from OS X, the you will see OS X installation software. However, if you put the same DVD in a machine running Windows, you will see the Boot Camp Support Software containing the Windows drivers.\n\nApparently, if using the Boot Camp Support Software from a OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) DVD, the version of Boot Camp is 3. I have provided links for the version 2 and 3 updates.\nI am not saying you can not deviate from what Apple officially states is available for Windows. Since I do not have access to your model Mac, I can not state which deviations will work. I can state the following:\n\n*\n\n*You will not be able to boot a Windows installer from a USB port.\n\n*You will not be able to EFI boot any version of Windows.\n\n*The Windows drivers provided in the Boot Camp Support Software are design for a BIOS booting Windows. Trying to use these drivers with an EFI booting Windows is known to have issues.\n\n*A newer version of the Boot Camp Support Software (Windows Support Software) can provide a newer version of Boot Camp. However, unless Apple specifically states the version is for your Mac, then most likely the version will not have the correct drivers for your model Mac.\n\nUsing a DVD to Install a BIOS Booting Windows 10\n\nThis installation method does not require OS X (macOS) to be installed on the Mac. However, the assumption has been made that the firmware is capable of BIOS booting and the processors are Intel.\n\nMany early 64 bit Intel Mac models contained firmware which prevented BIOS booting from 64 bit Windows installer DVDs. Here, I will assume your Mac is one such model. The latest 32 bit Windows 10 installer DVDs also can not be booted on these model Macs. However, my answer to the question “Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install explains how to remedy this problem. Here the assumption is made that the DVD used to install Windows 10 will have been created by procedure outlined in my answer.\n\nNote: During the installation of Windows 10, you may have to remove all existing partitions before being allowed to proceed.\n\nAfter completing the Windows installation, install the Boot Camp Support Software (Windows Support Software). The Boot Camp Support Software is on the Snow Leopard installation DVD. The files can be accessed from Windows. Officially, only 32 bit versions of Windows can be installed on your Mac. Since I do not have your model Mac, I can not predict how difficult it will be to the adapt the software for use with a 64 bit Windows. You should consult lx07's answer for more information.\nA Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) ISO file can be downloaded from the website Mac OS X Snow Leopard Install DVD. You should verify the download by computing the SHA256 hash value. The Get-FileHash Power Shell cmdlet can be used to compute a SHA256 hash value. Entering Get-FileHash along with the path to the downloaded file in a Power Shell window should produce the following SHA256 hash value.\nCBEEB2378C40B20A9B06236F567DE593E9030A0A865515B50CF6D35833E25CD5\n\nUnder Windows 10, the Boot Camp Support Software can be accessed by mounting this ISO file.\nAfter installing Boot Camp to your Windows installation, you should make sure your Mac is blessed to BIOS boot by default. The steps are given below.\n\n*\n\n*In Windows on your Mac, click the show hidden icons arrow  in the right side of the taskbar, then click the Boot Camp icon , then choose Boot Camp Control Panel.\n\n*If a User Account Control dialog appears, click Yes.\n\n*Select Windows as the startup disk.\n\n*If you want to reboot, click Restart. Otherwise, click OK.\n\nAn alternate method to insure the Mac is blessed to BIOS boot by default, would be to boot from a OS X (macOS) installation DVD or USB flash drive, open a Terminal window and enter the command given below.\nbless --device /dev/disk0 --setBoot --legacy\n\nDual Boot Example\nThis answer was tested using the following downloaded ISO files.\n\n*\n\n*The English 20H2 edition of Windows 10. This is the October 2020 update. The names of the downloaded files were Win10_20H2_English_x32.iso and Win10_20H2_English_x64.iso.\n\n*32 bit Kubuntu Desktop LTS 18.04.5. The name of the downloaded file was kubuntu-18.04.5-desktop-i386.iso.\n\n*64 bit Xubuntu Desktop LTS 20.04.1. The name of the downloaded file was xubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso\nPart I. Partitioning and Installing 32 Bit Windows 10.\nThis is an example where a rewritable DVD is burned for a 32 bit Windows 10 installation. During installation of Windows 10, the drive will be partitioned for a future dual boot, where Kubuntu or Xubuntu would occupy the first partition. The steps are given below.\n\n*\n\n*Create a 32 bit Windows 10 installation DVD. Use the instructions given in my answer to the question “Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install.\n\n\n*Boot from the 32 bit Windows 10 installation DVD.\nWhen the image below appears, enter the key combination shift+F10 to open a Command Prompt window.\n\nEnter the following commands to partition the drive. The value of 60000 MB can be replaced with your desired size of the partition for a future Kubuntu or Xubuntu installation.\ndiskpart\nlist disk\nselect disk 0\nclean \ncreate partition primary size=60000\nformat label=AVAILABLE quick\ncreate partition primary\nformat label=BOOTCAMP quick\nlist partition\nexit\nexit\n\nContinue with the installation of Windows 10.\n\n\n*When the image below appears, select Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).\n\nNext, highlight the BOOTCAMP partition as shown below, then select the Next button.\n\nContinue and complete the Windows 10 installation.\n\n\n*Follow the same instructions regarding installing the Boot Camp Support Software and blessing the Mac to BIOS boot, as given in the above section titled \"Using a DVD to Install a BIOS Booting Windows\".\nPart II. Replacing 32 Bit Windows 10 with a 64 Bit Windows 10\n\nNote: If you are satisfied with a 32 Windows 10, then you can skip the part and proceed to part III.\n\nThis is an example where a 64 bit Windows 10 was desired, but a dual layer DVD containing a 64 bit Windows 10 installer was unavailable. The 64 bit Windows 10 ISO file will be used to replace the 32 bit Windows 10 with a 64 Bit Windows 10.\n\n*\n\n*Use the File Explorer to format the AVAILABLE volume. Below is an example image. Select the Start button, then select the OK button in the popup.\n\n\n\n*Use the File Explorer to mount the 64 bit Windows 10 ISO file.\n\n\n*Use the File Explorer to copy all the files from the mounted 64 bit Windows 10 ISO file to the AVAILABLE volume.\n\n\n*Use the Disk Management utility to mark active (bootable) the partition containing the AVAILABLE volume, as shown below. When the popup window appears, select the Yes button.\n\n\n\n*Restart the Mac.\n\n\n*When the image below appears, enter the key combination shift+F10 to open a Command Prompt window.\n\nEnter the following commands to format the BOOTCAMP volume. Also, set the active (bootable) flag for the partition containing the BOOTCAMP volume.\ndiskpart\nselect disk 0\nselect partition 2\nformat label=BOOTCAMP quick\nactive\nexit\nexit\n\nContinue with the installation of Windows 10.\n\n\n*When the image below appears, select Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).\n\nNext, highlight the BOOTCAMP partition as shown below, then select the Next button.\n\nContinue and complete the Windows 10 installation.\n\n\n*Follow the same instructions regarding installing the Boot Camp Support Software and blessing the Mac to BIOS boot, as given in the above section titled \"Using a DVD to Install a BIOS Booting Windows\".\n\n\n*Use the File Explorer to format the AVAILABLE volume. Below is an example image. Select the Start button, then select the OK button in the popup.\n\nPart III. Adding a 32 bit Kubuntu Installation\n\n*\n\n*Burn the downloaded 32 bit Kubuntu ISO file to a DVD.\n\n\n*Boot from the 32 bit Kubuntu DVD.\n\n\n*Install Kubuntu. When the image below appears, select Manual, then select the Continue button.\n\nHighlight the /dev/sda1 device line, as shown below. Next, select the Change button.\n\nIn the popup window, leave the partition size unchanged and set the other controls as shown in the image below. When finished, select the OK button.\n\nThe results are shown in the image below. Next, select Install Now button, then the Continue button in the popup window.\n\nFinish installing Kubuntu.\nPart IV. Replacing 32 Bit Kubuntu with a 64 bit Xubuntu\n\n*\n\n*Create a partition to hold the 64 bit Xubuntu ISO file. First, boot to Windows. Use the Disk Management utility to shrink the BOOTCAMP volume and the containing partition, as shown below.\n\nWhen the popup window appears, enter a value for the amount of space to shrink. The value need to be larger than the size of 64 bit Xubuntu ISO file. In this case, 2000 MB was entered, as shown below. Next, select the Shrink button.\n\nCreate a new simple volume in the unallocated space, as shown below. When the popup windows occurs, select the Next button. Again, in the next popup window, click on the Next button.\n\nWhen the popup windows shown below appears, select Do not assign a drive letter or drive path, as shown below. When finished, select the Next button.\n\nWhen the popup windows shown below appears, select Do not format this volume, as shown below. When finished, select the Next button. In the next popup window, click on the Finish button.\n\nFor this example, the result is shown below. Close the Disk Management utility.\n\n\n\n*Install the 64 bit Xubuntu ISO file into the new partition. First, boot to Kubuntu. Open a Konsole Terminal window. The assumption has been made that 64 bit Xubuntu ISO file is named xubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso and resides in the ~/Downloads folder. Enter the commands below to copy this file to the new partition create in the previous step.\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo dd if=xubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sda3 bs=1M\n\n\n\n*Reboot the Mac. When the image below appears, press the C key.\n\nEnter the commands given below to boot the Xubuntu.\ninsmod iso9660\nroot=(hd0,msdos3)\nlinux /casper/vmlinuz\ninitrd /casper/initrd\nboot\n\n\n\n*When the desktop shown below appears, execute Install Xubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.\n\nProceed with the installation of Xubuntu. For a brief moment during the installation, the following screen will appear with a warning message.\n\nThe above screen will quickly be replaced by the screen shown below. Here the same warning message appears, but is partially covered.\n\n\nThe intent is to install to the existing partition /dev/sda1.\n\nHighlight the /dev/sda1 device, then click on the Change button. In the popup window, do not change the size value. Configure the rest of the controls as shown below, then click on the OK button.\n\nFor this example, the result is shown below. Click on the Install Now button, then click on the Continue button in the popup window.\n\nFinish installing Xubuntu.\n\n\n*Remove the unnecessary partition and extend the Windows 10 partition. Boot to Windows 10. Use the Disk Management utility to delete RAW primary partition, as shown below. In the popup window, click on the Yes button.\n\nRight click on the partition with the drive letter C:. Select Extend Volume…. In the popup window, click on the Next button. Again, in the next popup window, click on the Next button. In the next popup window, click on the Finish button.\n\nThe result is shown below.\n\nExit the Disk Management application.\nReferences\nApple MacBook Pro 15-Inch \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.16 Specs (Late 2006, MacBookPro2,2)\nApple MacBook Pro 15-Inch \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.2 (SR) Specs (Mid/Late 2007, MacBookPro3,1)\nApple Introduces Boot Camp\nSetting Up Boot Camp\nInstall Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp\nAbout EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers\nBoot Camp - Windows XP Drivers Update 2.1\nBoot Camp Drivers Update 2.2 for Windows\nBoot Camp Software Update 3.1 for Windows 32 bit\nBoot Camp Software Update 3.1 for Windows 64 bit\nBoot Camp Software Update 3.2 for Windows 32 bit\nBoot Camp Software Update 3.2 for Windows 64 bit\nBoot Camp Software Update 3.3 for Windows\n“Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install\nStart up your Mac in Windows or macOS with Boot Camp\n\nA: I would buy a cheap PC or newer used Mac.

However, all other scaled options are outputting at 1080p. Is this expected? I saw somewhere that if I use DisplayPort instead of HDMI, I may have additional options, but I can't find any official documentation. Is that true?\n\nA: \nI saw somewhere that if I use DisplayPort instead of HDMI, I may have additional options, but I can't find any official documentation.\n\nIt depends on the capability of the monitor, the cables and the converters.  If, for instance your monitor supported HDMI spec 1.4  but you used an older cable certified with the 1.2 spec, you'd be limited to the refresh rates you could use at certain resolutions (i.e. 120Hz at 720p).  When connecting display devices (whether HDMI or DP), there's a number of variables you have to account for to ensure you're getting the best (or maximum) performance; it's not so simple to say \"HDMI gives you this\" or \"DispayPort gives you that.\"\nThat said, I would say that DisplayPort provides you with better reliability than HDMI due to the fact that the native signal is DisplayPort.  You have to convert that signal to get HDMI.\nNow, when you convert, you introduce complexity and that can affect reliability and performance.\n\n*\n\n*What's wrong with HDMI?\n", "Q: How to add access to the camera to one app which doesn't appears in the system preferences ->privacy menu? Hi I have an app which take screenshoots from my macbook, but I didn't give access to the camera when I installed the app, that's why I am not able to use this app now, which has very nice tools to comment and edit the screenshoots. My question is, how can I give permissions to this app if it doesn't appears in the menu system preferences -> privacity -> camera, how can I add this app to this section or give the camera permissions? Thanks!\n\nThe app is lightshot I was able to use it in another mac, where I gave the permissions when I installed it, the another problem here is that when I installed it again it didn't ask me to give permissions maybe for some kind of history.\nFor more clarity, what I would like to do is to be able to show the lighshot app in the privacy -> camera section, just as in the next picture.\n\nThanks!\n\nA: Apps only appear in privacy settings when they attempt to use the category.\nThe Camera privacy settings refers to photographs and videos from the built-in camera, which is not something Lightshot uses.\nThe list on the left of Privacy settings also contains Screen Recording lower down, which is what is required for apps to be able to take screenshots.\n", "Q: How can I read the battery level of a MacBook in Swift? I have seen many post here/on SO and many docs on Apple's website about reading the battery level on iOS, but what's the best way to do this on a MacBook? In the past the only way I've found to do this is with a time-consuming bash command piped to grep, which seems very inefficient. (as seen and adapted from, although I can't locate the original source I read,  here and here) Is there a better way to do this programmatically? I've also seen this, but that only appears to have an Obj-C version. Is there any way to do this in Swift?\nEDIT\nThere's actually a better way that doesn't take any significant time (ioreg -l -w0 | grep Capacity shows current charge and maximum capacity), but it is still a seemingly unneeded bash script.\n\nA: Yes, it can be done fully in Swift. You mention that you have found a sub-optimal solution for you in using the \"ioreg\" command line tool. You can find the full source code (in C) for the ioreg tool here - for inspiration:\nhttps://github.com/opensource-apple/IOKitTools/blob/master/ioreg.tproj/ioreg.c\nThat tool gets the battery level for you by reading the properties of the I/O devices - the battery level being one such property. It reads them using a function that in Swift is available as IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperties() in the IOKit framework.\n", "Q: Invisible Space preventing me from growing HD partition to original size \nI want to restore my original Macintosh HD disk to its maximum size however in the partition map which should be 121.33GB it only adds up to 84GB.

I have an older MacBook Pro that generally runs just fine. But sometimes, it slows so much as to be unusable - to the point that I can type a couple dozen characters and sit back to watch as they take a full 10 to 15 seconds to appear on the screen.\nChecking Activity Monitor, I can not find any problems, and in fact, see that the system and user are both only using 4% to 5% of CPU, leaving the CPU 90% to 92% idle - I have never sen it go below 86%.\nOnly 10 to 12 GB of the 16GB memory is being used.  I am displaying All Processes and set the Update Frequency to 1 second.  I am maxed out on the OS with High Sierra 10.13.6.\nSimStreamProcessorService often shows up at the top of the list when the computer slows to the point of being unusable and after a Force Quit the computer will operate normally.  For awhile.\nIs there a reason Activity Monitor is not showing me how I can use 90% of the CPU?\n\nA: Unfortunately the answer is most likely \"yes.\"\nThere is a reason, or at least a possible to likely reason(s).\nThis could easily be bound to a failing component (logic board, drive, I/O etc.) As if there are hardware problems those won't show up in activity monitor. Ask someone who (very recently) knows.\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Mac while holding the d to go into diagnostic mode. The Mac will do its thing and report any problems it can.\n\n*Boot the Mac into Recovery Mode by holding the ⌘r kees at boot.\n\nOnce in recovery mode go to Disk utility. Select the top drive (your boot drive) and click on First aid.\nBoth of those tests will find gross issues with your Mac. It is not a guarantee that it will find a problem with any hardware or soft errors/bad blacks on the SSD. But it is always with trying.\nOK so we've tried diagnostic tools, how about a different user profile? Go into System Preferences, create a new admin user and log in as that user. Problem gone? The issue was something in your user profile. The fun part is finding what it was. And by fun, I mean no fun at all.\nIf nothing is found there. I would back up your whole drive (Time Machine or 3rd party utility) Create a flash drive macOS installer with your preferred OS version (there are tutorials all over the place on hot to do this). Boot from the installer, re-format your HD and install the OS fresh.\nOnce that is done boot your mac normally and before restoring any of your apps, docs, pics or settings see if the problem is still there.\nIf the problem still exists it is most likely hardware and time to either have it repaired or buy a new Mac.\n", "Q: How to determine wasted space by large chunk size on macOS RAID array? Working on a system that was created with a macOS RAID array with 256k chunk size for the members. The drive was originally to be used for video and image editing and storage, but has now become a multipurpose drive that has a lot of smaller files on it.  How can I determine the amount of wasted space on the drive that might be caused by this large chunk size?\nIf it is too considerable I believe I'll move these files to another drive and recreate the array with smaller chunk size commensurate with the usage now.\n\nA: The chunk size of your RAID array does not determine how much space on disk a single file uses. Therefore no space is actually wasted due to having a larger chunk size than optimal.\nThe amount of space wasted is instead determined by the file system block size, which is independent of the RAID array chunk size. On macOS, you're typically looking at APFS, which uses 4096 byte blocks - or HFS+ which uses 512 byte sectors that are typically grouped together in allocation blocks of 4096 bytes (unless you have a RAID drive that is more than 16 TB, then it is larger).\nYou can determine your allocation block size by running this command in the Terminal (change the device node to match your disk setup):\ndiskutil info /dev/disk2s1\n\nUnfortunately lots of \"myths\" and wrong information has circulated regarding RAID chunk sizes, as it has been seen as a form of \"dark arts\" to choose the right size. It is essentially hard to choose the optimal chunk size from a long list of options without actually benchmarking with the actual data and operations done on them.\nHowever, in your case you actually have the type of setup you want. If you have many small files, you actually want a big chunk size on your RAID. If you have fewer, large files, you want a small chunk size on your RAID.\nUnfortunately some have heard the opposite advice here. That comes from the fact that if you have a single disk, you want the opposite - i.e. for storing few, large files you want big blocks, and for storing many, smaller files, you want small blocks. This is because you want to minimize the number of block operations per second with large files to optimize throughput, whereas for smaller files, you want to optimize for latency by having smaller blocks and thus more operations per second.\nHowever, on a RAID-system with many disks - things are ofcourse different. When dealing with large files, you want to distribute the workload evenly over many drives to optimize performance. This means relatively small chunks so that you can get many drives working for you at once - each with their own small chunk. On the other hand, when you're dealing with small files, you want to ensure that most operations can be completed by a single drive only, so you get the lowest latency possible. This means a large chunk size to ensure that your data is contained in a single chunk that can be processed by a single disk.\n\nA: \nHow can I determine the amount of wasted space on the drive that might be caused by this large block size?\n\nThis is actually quite a difficult exercise and there's a whole discipline dedicated to architechting storage solutions. An answer here simply cannot do it justice.  However, the main issue is this condition:\n\nThe drive was originally to be used for video and image editing and storage, but has now become a multipurpose drive that has a lot of smaller files on it.\n\nThis means that the size of your files can vary wildly making an accurate forecast darn near impossible.  Not only do you have to know how the file sizes vary, you have to know how they vary over time as well.  There has to be an understanding of all the \"things\" that generate these blocks:  the OS, the filesystem, the applications, they array type, even the hardware contribute to these factors.\nFor an excellent perspective on this, HPE (Hewlett-Packard Enterprise) has an excellent write up:  Busting the Myth of Storage Block Size\n\nI don't know of any tools for the Mac (and I haven't done this type of exercise in a long, long, long time).  However, I did use tools like Sun Microsystems' Swat (Sun StorageTek Workload Analysis Tool). Storage vendors will typically include this type of tool as a value add to their storage solution.\nTo get this type of analysis on the Mac, you'll definitely need something similar to assist you in analyzing how your storage is allocated.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 - What can cause the front camera, rear camera and the flash to stop working, all at the same time? The front camera, rear camera and the flash light all stopped working simultaneously after I changed the charging port of my iPhone 6 myself (Apple doesn't do this).\nI initially thought that the cable might not have been seated properly but that is not the case, I'm pretty sure.\nIs there a way I can go about diagnosing this?\nEdit:\nI followed this video for changing the port - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnX_KKJnjOQ\nThe rest of the phone, including the new port, is working totally normally.\n\nA: There is a power supply chip responsible for powering both cameras if you removed the display you may have accidentally have damaged this small and delicate chip, without power to the cameras the flashlight will also not work.

My MacBook Pro 15” 2018 stopped working. The CPU model is:\n\n2.6GHz 6‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.3GHz\n\nI brought it to official Apple Service. They didn’t tell me what got broken, they just said in order to repair it I need to replace a logic board.\nI brought my MacBook to another unofficial service. They found that the CPU got damaged. They changed the CPU and my MacBook Pro works now. And it is cheaper than the official Apple Service wanted to charge my for the new logic board. My Mac is still at the service shop, I’m gonna collect it from the service shop this week.\nMy question, is it safe to replace a CPU only? I heard that Macs can break again and a better option is to replace a logic board entirely. Is this true? Does anybody have anything to say about it?\n\nA: Depends on what you mean by \"safe\" exactly. Replacing a CPU is in itself safe in terms of not inherently creating any new risk of damaging the computer, or creating safety risks for the user.\nHowever the tech must take care to replace the CPU in the correct manner (i.e. you need to handle it properly without damaging the new CPU), and you need to replace the CPU with the same model (i.e. replacing the CPU with a higher wattage CPU is not a good idea).\nNote that if the CPU was damaged due to a problem with the logic board itself (for example if it was damaged by an overvoltage caused by a logic board problem) - then you are ofcourse still at risk of damaging the new CPU also.\n", "Q: How to remove Windows partitions on external HDD? \nHi!

I am on macOS Catalina.\n\nA: The message Homebrew shows you after installing curl gives you all the required details\n==> Caveats\ncurl is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,\nbecause macOS already provides this software and installing another version in\nparallel can cause all kinds of trouble.\n\nIf you need to have curl first in your PATH run:\n  echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/curl/bin:$PATH\"' >> /Users/pse/.bash_profile\n\nFor compilers to find curl you may need to set:\n  export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib\"\n  export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/curl/include\"\n\nFor pkg-config to find curl you may need to set:\n  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig\"\n\n\nSo you need to either alias the Homebrew curl so it gets picked up in interactive shells or add its path to PATH as explained in the text above (which explains it for bash, you need to add the respective entry to .zshrc (or wherever zsh takes its paths from)).\n", "Q: Pair a bluetooth mouse directly with Macbook Air I have Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse, which has a dedicated Bluetooth receiver USB dongle. When I plug it in on the left-hand side of the laptop and the mouse is physically on the right-hand side of the laptop, there is some kind of interference and the mouse does not work, it only works when the mouse is physically on the left-hand side of the laptop, closer to the dongle.\nIs there a way to pair the mouse directly with the built-in Bluetooth in the Macbook Air so I don't have to use the USB dongle?\nIt is Macbook Air 13\" 2020, and Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse.\n\nA: *\n\n*The mouse has a fixed connection to the dongle, you can not use a normal bluetooth connection\n\n*Once the bluetooth dongle fails or you lose it, you can't simply buy a new dongle, since you are unable to pair the mouse to it again. This means once you will end up with a useless mouse\n\nNote: You have to dig a little deeper into the reviews/questions for example here on Amazon to verify that you can not buy dongle replacements\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur creates duplicate versions of files Several times in a day, I notice duplicate versions of my files being created. Refer to the screenshot - empty.html.erb was duplicated, and a new empty.html 2.erb was created.\nWhat is causing this, and how can I stop this?\n\nI feel like this might have something to do with TimeMachine and backups, since it only started after I enabled backups to iCloud and moved my files from ~ to ~/Documents/\n\nA: The problem seems to be that you're using git ontop of iCloud Drive. I.e. the problem is not with Time Machine and backups at all - it is instead that you have chosen to store your ~/Documents/ folder in iCloud Drive, which is not compatible with programs such as git.\nThe issue is that iCloud Drive treats each file as an individual and independent file, whereas git assumes a specific relationship between the files. Git uses hidden files that contain information about other files in the folder - it expects them to be \"in sync\" - and it expects it is the only program manipulating the files; this assumption does not necessarily hold here.\nImagine for example that you run a git operation that touches several files in your folder - it might move stuff around, delete and recreate, change access times, etc. It does so very quickly while keeping its own state. iCloud Drive is triggered by these changes and starts a sync - however there's a lag between git something and the sync being triggered. Then later iCloud Drive might have sent something to the server and received data back, and it goes to store it and sees that the file (or its metadata) has changed underneath it. Now iCloud Drive has a conflict that could be solved by overwriting your local file, trashing the file just received from the server - or as the case is here - preserving the new data by saving it with a \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", etc. suffix.\nThis problem is common with almost any file syncing system, so you would experience similar problems with Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.\nThe solution to this is to not an iCloud Drive backed Documents folder, or move your git repository out of the Documents folder.\n", "Q: Replacement for CGSession --suspend? I used to cause my iMac to put up its lock screen from shell scripts. It was dead simple:\n'/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession' -suspend\nIn MacOS Big Sur, /User.menu/ is not at that location, and I cannot find a file named CGSession. What is the equivalent command line in Big Sur? I would like to avoid using root privilege for this task.\n\nA: User.menu is but one of many missing on macOS Big Sur, namely Battery.menu, Bluetooth.menu, Clock.menu, Displays.menu, Eject.menu, IrDA.menu, UniversalAccess.menu, User.menu, and Volume.menu.\nAssuming you have not changed the system default keyboard shortcut for Lock Screen, ⌃⌘Q, the following command in Terminal will lock the screen:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to key code 12 using {control down, command down}'\n\nThe first time I executed that command it failed and I was prompted with two dialog boxes, the first being:\n\nAfter clicking OK, the second one was:\n\nClicking Open System Preferences took me to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility, where I clicked the check box for Terminal after unlocking the pane.\nI then executed the command again in Terminal and it locked the screen.\nAfter unlocking the screen, I then created a shell script as lockscreen in /usr/local/bin, e.g:\ncd /usr/local/bin\nsudo nano lockscreen\n\nAdded the following code:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to key code 12 using {control down, command down}'\n\nThen pressed ⌃X followed by Y and then Enter, and back a the prompt:\nsudo chmod +x lockscreen\n\nI then executed the lockscreen command and it too worked, and without having to make any additional security changes. It also works when calling it from other shell scripts.\n\nNote: If you prefer to use a osascript shebang, instead of zsh, use the following code:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to key code 12 using {control down, command down}\n\n\nA: FWIW, I use a workaround which doesn't exactly suspend the session but rather puts the laptop to sleep. In my workflow, these achieve the same thing as both times I get to the lock screen. Bonus part of putting the machine to sleep is it's more power efficient as I actually prefer it going to sleep when I walk away from it.\nalias lock=\"pmset sleepnow\" in my .bashrc/.zshrc file. Alternatively, pmset displaysleepnow achieves somewhat similar behaviour to what CGSession -suspend did.\n", "Q: apsd/mDNSResponder spamming thousands of DNS queries per second on macOS Big Sur I upgraded a machine to macOS Big Sur two days ago, and after a day or so my PiHole DNS server randomly stopped working, which upon inspection was caused by gigabytes of logs for DNS queries made by the Big Sur machine overwhelming the poor thing. I monitored DNS requests on the machine with tcpdump:\n$ sudo tcpdump port 53 -k NP\nxx:xx:xx.xxxx (proc mDNSResponder:32622, eproc apsd:108) IP 192.168.0.xxx.xxxxx > pi.domain: 24541+ A? xxx-courier-x.push-apple.com.akadns.net.

Anyone got insight? Or experiencing something similar and have more details to add?\n\nA: This keeps coming up every day or two, so eventually I wrote a small utility called mDNSSupervisor to monitor mDNSResponder and restart it whenever it's apparently going berserk. Doesn't solve the underlying issue of course but enough to cure the symptom and be mostly safe from its effects.\nYou can download the tool if you want from https://github.com/zmwangx/mDNSSupervisor (free, WTFPL licensed).

Can anyone advice please? Thank you so much! Terminal after restart (before restart it was showing ttysXXXX on the first line\nThis is the content of the suspicious installer:\n\n\nA: The problem with getting pirated software is three fold:\n\n*\n\n*The websites that host the software will often do contain  trackers, adware, spyware, malware, etc.\n\n*The software itself can be modified to install additional malware\n\n*Some of it is innocuous - simple scripts to open ports/back doors, log keystrokes or steal your identity.\n\nMicrosoft and IDC published a whitepaper entitled  The Dangerous World of Counterfeit and Pirated Software (making it quite apropos considering it was pirated Office software) and this answer makes extensive use as a resource.\n\nIn  the  search  for  counterfeit  copies  of  Office  on  the  Internet  (across  270  Web sites and P2P networks), we encountered malware just by visiting these sources: tracking cookies and spyware detected on our virtual PCs from 75%of the sites, Trojans and malicious adware at 14%\n\nWhat this means is that just showing up to search for and download the software, you're immediately attacked using a wide array of tools like malware, adware, spyware, trackers, etc.  It's a shotgun approach by the site/hackers to see what they can get from you.\nNeedless to say, not only are they trying to get something on your computer, the fact that they're using trackers tells us they're building a profile.\n\nHowever, 60% of the downloaded software didn't come with activation keys, which meant  some  users had to  go  back  to  the  download  site  at  least  once  and sometimes  repeatedly  to  obtain  illegal  keys.\n\nThis is an interesting technique...what better way to get a better \"picture\" of your victim than to force them to return to get activation keys or cracks.  This  also inherently treks them that the installation of their compromised software was successful!\n\nMost  of the  CDs/DVDs  came  with  extra  software,  whether  wanted  or  not,  and often the installation process displayed unusual behavior, such as music playing during installation, pop-ups showing up with Web links to dating or pornography sites, or links to other sites known to be potential security threats\n\nEmphasis mine\nGranted, you didn't get an actual CD/DVD media, but these care commonly distributed as disk images (ISO/DMG) and the \"unusual behavior\" is in line with what you and/or your brother saw with respect to Terminal.\nThis is the crux of the problem!\nA simple script (bash or sh) is all that's is required to open some firewall ports or modify a user shell environment file like .bash_profile or .zprofile to source some malicious code every time you open a Terminal shell.  These types of scripts won't necessarily show up as malware.  It could be a simple script using curl to connect to a website run by a hacker sending something as innocuous as you IP address or using scp to silently copy a file like your key chain.\nRemember, the genuine installer requires Admin credentials to run and you provide them when you enter your password. Any nefarious steps added will then be installed with admin (sudo) privileges.\nI'm assuming that the Terminal screen you're referring to is showing a login from a different TTY. (It's very difficult to see the Terminal prompt in the 4th picture). The script could have opened a backdoor to your computer.\nThe Risk\n\nA good majority of people worry about data loss and they should be.  Ransomware can bring you or your business to a complete halt because the perpetrators are literally holding your data hostage by making it inaccessible and unusable.\nThe second is identity theft (this is the bigger risk IMO).  Having the installer add some scripts (even to cron so they run periodically) to  send things like browser cookies, your IP address, your bookmarks, password files (keychain) and even install keyloggers (we'll get back to this one).  It would be super easy to figure out that you banked at ACME bank, did your shopping at H&K and Amazon, you have a VISA from BankOne, and a MasterCard from BankTwo and you use the same username for them all.\nKeyloggers\nKeyloggers are a very special type of malware.  They straddle the line between bona fide malware and legitimate software.  From Malwarebytes:\n\nAlthough for our purposes, keyloggers operate in the context of malware, they are not always illegal to install and use. Keyloggers are a common tool for corporations, which information technology departments use to troubleshoot technical problems on their systems and networks—or to keep an eye on employees surreptitiously. The same goes for, say, parents, who want to monitor their children’s activities. Suspicious spouses are another market for keyloggers.\n\nThis means a keylogger commonly used by (for example) parents to oversee their children's' behavior while online can be utilized by a hacker to capture your keystrokes.  Using a simple bash script, it would be super easy to scp that file to a website somewhere.\nPutting this altogether now, we potentially have a method to gather all of your browsing/surfing info creating a profile or a \"picture\" of you, your password (key chain) files, your location on the web (IP) and your passwords (and other credentials) all sent to an obscure web location.  All of it operating under the radar because technically, none of it is malware; they're just scripts calling built in tools like curl or scp.\nMitigation\n\n*\n\n*Make a different back up of your data!  Ransomware works by encrypting your existing data with a key only your attacker knows.  If your data happened to get compromised, you don't want overwrite an older, but clean Time Machine backup with bad data.\n\n\n*Wipe your drive and reinstall your OS.  It's not impossible to clean this up; it's tedious and time consuming.  Additionally, you'll always be wondering if you \"got everything.\"  The most efficient way to be positive that you've removed all potential threats is to wipe your drive clean and reinstall macOS (from a trusted source, of course).\n\n\n*Reinstall your Apps manually or restore from a Time Machine backup taken prior to the install of pirated software.  This way you can be certain you're not bringing back compromised files.\n\n\n*Manually copy/restore data that was backed up post infection as you need it.  It's very likely the data is safe, but for piece of mind, take an extra step and give it a once over before copying back to your system.\n\n\n*Change your passwords!  Especially if you reuse credentials for different services.  The problem here is that you don't know what was compromised - so the safest course of action is to change the password so that if it was compromised, the exposure is limited.  It's very important to use different credentials for different services.  Using a (paid) product like 1Password, Keeper or the open source KeePass can help you do this.\n\n\n*Going forward, consider using APFS snapshots before installing software.  This will allow you to roll-back to a previously known-good state of your system.\nTL;DR\nThe pirated software obviously did something when it was installed.  The problem is, if it simply installed some scripts that copy files and installed a keystroke logger, it can circumvent detection by malware scanners and anti-virus tools.\nThe only efficient and surefire way to fix this is to wipe your drive clean and reinstall.  The problem is, you don't know what was done, so you have to assume the worst and mitigate it from that standpoint.\nLoss of data is always a big concern so having regular backups would be (again) a saving grace here. Identity theft is (IMO) more of a concern so changing your passwords to your accounts, especially ones that have critical data on you (i.e. financial, medical, taxes, etc.) is a high priority.  Even though you may have to reuse login/username (lots of websites use email addresses), never reuse your password - don't make it easy for the attackers!\nFinally, understand the time/effort that goes into fixing this all to save a few dollars by getting some pirated software.  Hopefully I've painted a picture of the immense risk that you were opened up to, but as you go through the clean up process, you'll see how time and labor intensive this is.   Your brother owes you big time on this one...I see you being treated to a very expensive restaurant visit in the near future.\n", "Q: Upgrading from Mojave 10.14.3 to Mojave 10.14.6 (or at most Catalina), but not to Big Sur?

The webpage I want to remote debug is opened in Safari on an iPhone SE with iOS 14.2.\nThe answers I got on StackOverflow suggest that I should upgrade my macOS Safari and/or my XCode version installed on my Macbook.\nI see that there is a download for Safari 14.0.1 Beta 4 but it requires at least macOS Mojave 10.14.6.\nFrom https://xcodereleases.com/, I see that my current XCode version 10.3 is the latest I can get given my MacOS Mojave version 10.14.3\nSo I definitely have to upgrade my MacOS version.\nWhen I go to Preferences -> Software Updates, I see this screen:\n\nThen if I click on \"More info...\" under \"Other updates are available.\" I get this screen:\n\nSo it looks like I could upgrade to MacOS Mojave 10.14.6, which would allow me to install XCode Xcode 11.3.1 at most and also upgrade Safari to version 14\nGreat, but I fear that clicking on the \"install now\" button would also install the latest and recently released \"Big Sur\" because this is what i see on the Software Updates screen.\nSo this is my (indeed simple, but I wanted to provide more context) question: Can I make sure I upgrade to Mojave 10.14.6 only and not Big Sur from the Software Updates screen I see ?\n\nA: Yes, clicking on \"Install now\" in the second screenshot will install only the updates listed and ticked.
