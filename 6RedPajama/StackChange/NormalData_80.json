["Q: What exactly happened with Apple throttling iPhones? I'm doing a business report on Apple Inc. and I'm on the legal issues section and I have to list and describe a few recent (last ~5-10 yrs) issues/lawsuits that the company faced. So far a major one appears to be them throttling old iPhones, and from what I've searched it seems that this was caused by an iOS update of some sort that slowed phones, preventing them from abruptly shutting off. So people thought their phones were defunct and bought new ones, while they didn't know they simply could've replaced the battery. Thus, lawsuits were filed. Am I right on this?\nAny correction/clarification would be appreciated. Providing any other major lawsuits/cases against Apple would also be appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: Some say throttling.\nOthers say the system stays running until you can have the battery serviced.\nYou are right. Lots of opinions and people taking action without learning the physics and basics. If Apple had been more open what was happening sooner, the lawsuit might not have succeeded to reach class-action status, but laws can be horribly flawed (slavery, death sentences, chopping off fingers or hands for instance). In the US pretty much anyone can sue and sometimes settling is smart to avoid risk of an adverse finding and not an admission or merit or guilt.\n", "Q: New Macs keep asking about old discarded Mac credentials I have only been using modern Macs for a year or so now. I was due to get a 2019 MBP from work in early 2020, so I got a 2009 MBP a few months before that to orient myself.\nI created an Apple ID and an iCloud account on the 2009 MBP. With a little difficulty, I was able to apply those credentials to the semi-locked-down 2019 MBP from work.\nSince then I have\n\n*\n\n*done a fresh install of the 2009 MBP\n\n*left the previous employer, returned the 2019 MBP, and started a new job\n\n*bought a 2020 M1 MBA\n\nDuring the 2009 MBP reinstall and the M1 MBA setup, I was asked for the login password on the 2019 MBP from my former job. I still remembered it, but that kinda freaked me out.\nNow I'm about to get a new Intel MBP from the new job. I don't want the credentials from the previous 2019 MBP to be associated with my personal 2020 M1 MBA or the new job's Intel MBP in any way.\nDoes this make sense to any of you? How can I undo those links and not create any new links from the surrendered 2019 MBP to any future Macs I get?\nUpdate\nThanks to @jaune, I went to my Apple ID web page and looked at the Devices section. The 2019 MBP from my previous employer did not appear. I guess I need to learn more about the keychain, @jksoegaard !\n\n\nA: Could it be that you forgot to sign out of iCloud on the 2019 MacBook Pro from your former job?\nWhen setting up a new device, if iCloud Keychain is active, you will be asked to type the login password or passcode of another device that you are signed in to with your Apple ID, see Approve a device to use iCloud Keychain for details.\nIf you forgot to sign out of iCloud on one of your devices and have given the device away, it could happen that Apple asks you to type the password of that device. In this case, you will have to manually remove the device, as explained in this support article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205064. For example, using the Apple ID website:\n\n*\n\n*Sign in to your Apple ID account page (https://appleid.apple.com), then scroll to Devices.\n\n\n*Click the device to see its details, then click \"Remove from account.\"\n\n\n\n*Review the message that appears.\n\n\n*Click again to confirm that you want to remove the device.\nFor more information on how Apple designs security, see the Apple Platform Security website.\n\nA: This happens due to you having iCloud Keychain enabled. The Keychain is end-to-end encrypted so that Apple cannot decrypt the contents of your keychain on their servers.\nWhen you add a new computer to your iCloud account, it tries to download the keychain to that computer. The contents cannot however be accessed with just the iCloud password - you will need to give the passphrase for the old device. Even though that device is really not around anymore, it was used to protect the Keychain originally, so its passphrase can help you unlock it now.\nNote: The Keychain is not somehow \"permanently\" linked to your old computer. Now that you have started using your new computer, you do not need the old computer's passphrase anymore. If you choose to add new devices later, you will be asked to enter the passphrase of your new computer instead.\n", "Q: How do I delete iTunes from my MacBook Pro I no longer need iTunes on my MacBook Pro and want to remove both the application and the music stored locally.\nHow can I accomplish this on macOS 10.12 Sierra?\n\nA: To delete iTunes Music:\nYour iTunes Music is stored in a Music Library. The default location is in the Music Folder in Finder.\nIf you don't know where the Music folder is, open Finder and click Go > Home and open the folder Music.\nYou can delete this entire folder. It will offer to create a new blank Library next time you open iTunes. You will lose all the music, of course, when you delete this folder.\nMusic/iTunes Application\nOn macOS Sierra you can delete iTunes, but I'd recommend against it. You would likely have to disable security features. Remember that Music is just a few hundred megabytes - less than 0.08% of even the smallest hard drives.\n\nA: From your comment:\n\nI want to delete the application and the music too\n\nUnderstand that updates to macOS Sierra can/may restore the iTunes.app, in which case you'd have to perform some of the following steps again. Upgrading macOS will install iTunes.app, or Music.app, depending on the version you upgrade to.\nNote: Make sure you have a current backup of the media you have in iTunes before you delete your music, etc.\nPlease read and understand these steps before proceeding.\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > User & Groups > You > Login Items, fo iTunesHelper exists, then Click the lock to make changes., entries your Admin credentials, select iTunesHelper, then click the [-] button.\n\n\n*If iTunes is closed and it shows on the Dock then control-click (right-click) it and select: Options > Remove from Dock\n\n\n*Open Terminal and use the following compound command to reboot to Recovery Mode:\n sudo nvram \"recovery-boot-mode=unused\"; sleep 2; sudo reboot\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Assuming you are an Admin account, type in your password and press: enter\n\n\n*Once in Recovery Mode from the macOS Utilities menu, click Utilities > Terminal and run the following commands, which assumes that Macintosh HD is the name of your Startup Disk:\n cd '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Applications'\n rm -r iTunes.app\n reboot\n\n\n\n*One back to your normal Desktop, to remove the media content of iTunes, your music etc. that existed in iTunes, open Finder and navigate to the Music folder in you Home folder and control-click (right-click) on the iTunes folder and select Move to Trash, then empty the Trash. On the Dock control-click (right-click) on the Trash can and click Empty Trash.\n", "Q: How to check how much \"free\" iGPU VRAM the system have in MB? How to check how much free iGPU VRAM the system have?\nI thought it was a simple easy task, but so far I don't find any useful result by googling.\nI knew how much VRAM I have. I knew I could run system_profiler SPDisplaysDataTyp at cml. I knew I could check GPU % of each application in Activity Monitor > % GPU Column. I knew there is Activity Monitor > Window > GPU History Window etc..\nBut none of them tell me how much iGPU VRAM the system uses and how much free VRAM is in MB value.\nDo anyone know how to check the info?\nCML way is preferred.\nif not, Built-in tool is preferred.\nif not, Open source tool is preferred.\nif not, Free tool is prefered.\nThank you very much.\nEdited: I don't want to use a paid app for this purpose.\n\nA: You can check this using the iStats Menu program, which is a paid app that you can try for free for 14 days:\nhttps://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\nNote that you'll probably find that the VRAM is maxed out, and there's much you can really use this metric for unless you happen to be a developer actively developing your own software using the GPU. In that case, you should use the free Instruments tool from Apple instead.\n", "Q: system storage full after migrating to new iPhone, old phone has plenty of free storage I have an iPhone 11 128GB with around 30GB of used storage.\nMost of the photos are uploaded up into 200GB iCloud which is full at the moment.\nI got an iPhone 12 and transferred data & settings over from iPhone 11, device to device as described here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210216. The transfer itself took around ~30min.\nWhat I ended up with, is an iPhone 12 with 122GB of storage is use, photo library taking around 90GB of it. My assumption is that for whatever reason a LOT of the photos from iCloud got stored locally on iPhone 12. The phones have same amount of photos in the libraries.\nHow can I get rid of the photos that that are currently LOCAL on iPhone 12, while they are living in the iCloud (uploaded from iPhone 11)?\n\nA: You most likely have selected keep originals in the photos settings.\nOpen the settings app and scroll down or search for photos. Then under the iCloud section there should be listed the following options:\n\n*\n\n*Optimise iPhone storage\n\n*Download and keep originals\nSelect the first option and your iPhone will offload older photos and only store them in iCloud. Only new photos and often viewed ones will be stored locally, so you can save a lot of space on your phone. Alternatively you can select this option if you go into [your name] -> iCloud -> Photos as described on AppleSupport.\n\nA: To answer my own question - I had to upgrade to the 2TB icloud storage, performed a fresh iCloud backup of the old iPhone 11. Restored it on iPhone 12 and storage is back to normal.\nNote - restoration of backup via iTunes ended up in the same situation - freshly restored iPhone 12 had ~100GB of used storage space. The backup itself was ~90GB, so I suspect that the photos that icloud photos \"moves\" to icloud are still on the device, just marked for deletion. Somehow the iTunes backup/restore or the device-to-device transfer restores them to the device too.\n", "Q: Text substitutions for superscript and subscript There is a way to individually create text substitutions on Mac for most applications, by going to System Preferences→Keyboard→Text and then creating text substitutions. For example, I've made the following ones for ₂, ₃, × and ²³. \nIf I wanted to, I could create more and more shortcuts like this, but that takes a lot of time. Is there a way to use Automator and/or Applescript and/or Terminal to make such substitutions for all such cases? For example, if I type _5002, it should come out looking like ₅₀₀₂.\n\nA: Here is one solution using the command line:\n\n*\n\n*Converting numbers to super/subscript\n\nThe sed utility allows you to use a translation table to convert characters to other characters:\n$ echo \"abc513\" | sed -e 'y|0123456789|⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹|'\nabc⁵¹³\n\n$ echo \"abc513\" | sed -e 'y|0123456789|₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉|'\nabc₅₁₃\n\nFrom there, we can write a tsubst script:\n$ cat ./tsubst\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction superscript { echo \"$1\" | sed -e 'y|0123456789|⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹|'; }\nfunction subscript   { echo \"$1\" | sed -e 'y|0123456789|₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉|'; }\n\nfunction phrase_from_shortcut_pattern {\n  if [[ \"$1\" =~ ^\\^(.+)$ ]]\n  then\n    # ^ -> superscript\n    echo \"$(superscript \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\")\"\n  elif [[ \"$1\" =~ ^_(.+)$ ]]\n  then\n    # _ -> subscript\n    echo \"$(subscript \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\")\"\n  else\n    echo \"$1\"\n  fi\n}\n\nphrase_from_shortcut_pattern \"${@}\"\n\nThat script takes one argument, a Text Replacement shortcut pattern with a ^ or _ prefix to indicate a super or subscript transformation, and returns the corresponding phrase:\n$ ./tsubst _answer42\nanswer₄₂\n\n$ ./tsubst ^answer42\nanswer⁴²\n\n\n\n*Generate phrases from lists or ranges of shortcut patterns\n\nWith that script, we can use bash loops and substitutions to generate phrases from a list of shortcut patterns:\n$ for p in _42 ^42; do echo \"${p} -> $(./tsubst \"${p}\")\"; done\n_42 -> ₄₂\n^42 -> ⁴²\n\nOr a range of shortcut patterns:\n$ for p in _{6..8} ^{9..11}; do echo \"${p} -> $(./tsubst \"${p}\")\"; done\n_6 -> ₆\n_7 -> ₇\n_8 -> ₈\n^9 -> ⁹\n^10 -> ¹⁰\n^11 -> ¹¹\n\n\n\n*Adding text substitutions from the command line\n\nThis is the tricky part... I found one command-line utility that does its job well: shortcuts.\n$ shortcuts read\n0: \"jrv\" —> \"J’arrive !\"\n1: \"omw\" —> \"On my way!\"\n\n$ shortcuts create \"xyz\" \"XYZ\"\n\n$ shortcuts read\n0: \"xyz\" —> \"XYZ\"\n1: \"jrv\" —> \"J’arrive !\"\n2: \"omw\" —> \"On my way!\"\n\n$ shortcuts delete xyz\n\n$ shortcuts read\n0: \"jrv\" —> \"J’arrive !\"\n1: \"omw\" —> \"On my way!\"\n\n\n\n*Automatically adding Text Replacement entries...\n\nNow we can compose the two utilities to add entries to the Text Replacements preferences:\n$ for p in _42 ^42 _{6..8} ^{9..11}; do\n>   ./shortcuts create \"${p}\" \"$(./tsubst \"${p}\")\"\n> done\n\n$ ./shortcuts read\n0: \"^11\" —> \"¹¹\"\n1: \"^10\" —> \"¹⁰\"\n2: \"^9\" —> \"⁹\"\n3: \"_8\" —> \"₈\"\n4: \"_7\" —> \"₇\"\n5: \"_6\" —> \"₆\"\n6: \"^42\" —> \"⁴²\"\n7: \"_42\" —> \"₄₂\"\n8: \"jrv\" —> \"J’arrive !\"\n9: \"omw\" —> \"On my way!\"\n\nAnd the result in the Text Replacements preferences:\n\n", "Q: Behaviour of development certificate in apple developer portal and keychain This is a question regarding Apple Development Certificates. There are two parts:\nPart 1: create and download certificates on apple developer portal.\nBackground:\nI can download my teammates developments certificates as well as mine on the apple developer portal certificate management page. When I download others', there is no private key linked to the certificate, When I download mine, there is. This makes total sense: I should have only access to my own private keys.\nQuestions:\nThe question is: is this determined by the developer portal? I log into developer portal, so when I download the certs, developer portal will give me the private key if the certs belong to me?\nThe next question is: where does the private key come from? Does developer portal generate the private keys based on the CSR I uploaded when I create the certificate?\nPart 2: certificates in keychain\nBackground:\nIn keychain, there is a \"My Certificates\" category. After I imported the certificates for myself and my teammates, all my certificates appear under the \"My Certificates\" category, and my teammates' certificates are excluded from this category. This makes total sense.\nQuestion:\nHow does Keychain know that these certificates belong to me? What information in the certificates are used by Keychain to achieve that? I thought it's the apple id in the certificate, but when I log out from my Macbook, Keychain still knows my certificates.\n\nA: First part of your question:\nNo, this does not have to do with the developer portal at all. The private key is on your local computer in advance, and \"linked up\" with the certificate when you download that. The private key is not stored in the developer portal, and it is not generated by the developer portal either.\nYou generate the private key on your local computer as part of generating the initial CSR.\nSecond part:\nKeychain assigns certificates for which you have the private key to the \"My Certificates\" group. It has nothing to do with your Apple-ID.\nIf the private key is on your computer, the corresponding certificate is listed under \"My Certificates\".\n", "Q: Is it possible to rename an USB or Bluetooth audio device? I am using a Bluetooth headset. To charge it, I need USB, and when connecting that, it appears two times as audio device - obviously once as Bluetooth device, once as USB device. Both audio devices show up with the exact same name. This is no huge problem, but everything sometimes gets confusing and weird. If I'm in video conferences and busy with other stuff, I don't want to spend even seconds to fool around with that.\nIs there a way to permanently rename such a device? I assume both a Bluetooth and an USB device has a unique ID which is the actual way for the laptop and the device to communicate; I guess the name is just a human-friendly label. At least the Bluetooth device is surely a persistent thing inside the Mac, since it knows that it has coupled with the device before.\nIf that is not pssible, is there a way to permanently block a specific USB device from ever showing up as audio device at all?\n\nA: After any Bluetooth device is paired and connected, Go to Preferences->Bluetooth and right-click the device you want to rename. From the context menu, select the ‘Rename’ option.\n\nA: To change the name of your USB Device you will need to reprogram the microcontroller in your USB Device with the name of your choice.\nYou'll have to reflash or edit the device's firmware again, which isn't trivial unless your gamepad happens to have open source firmware, but even then you'll need some know-how on how to edit, build, and flash it.\n\n*\n\n*So to make it as easy as possible, open the Audio-MIDI-Setup\n\n\n*Go to the \"+\" and press \"Create device with multiple outputs and select your device\" (or \"Create Multi-Output Device\")\n\n\n*Click on the name of the created main device to rename it to whatever you want. It should now be found in the sound system settings under your chosen name.\n", "Q: Lost admin privileges on iMac It happened after changing admin name following migration to new Mac Air. I've tried various suggested fixes calling for Single User Mode, then mount-uw/ and rm /var/db/. AppleSetUp, also going to Disk Utility and following suggestion to mount, etc. Nothing works. Every time I run a command I get no such file or directory, which I can only assume is why these fixes aren't working. Two questions:\n1.Is there another step to the usual fixes that I need to be taking to avoid \"no such file...\"?\n2. If all else fails, if I were to back up the system from Time Machine (pre-problem causing event), will my old admin privileges (name, password) be restored and things will be as they were, say, two weeks ago?\n(High Sierra 10.13.6 if that matters)\n\nA: It’s going to be hard to offer blanket advice since if your hardware has failed, your backup is suspect, no amount of correct process will help. This would be a data recovery project which is very different than trying to recover from a lost password, admin database corruption.\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling the current OS from recovery should fix the machine enough to follow this guide to reset the password. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211672\n\n*If you know your backup is good, erase the Mac and then migrate back. https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac\nIf you ask a follow on question making notes which parts of the password reset process you chose and what step was the last you could complete, we might be able to offer a process change in case you missed a step or there’s an undocumented fix, but there are a ton of steps in the reset process, hard to guess where your case diverged from the expected path...\n", "Q: How to set the default command, with options, to open a file on MacOS?

I would like to restore my iphone to iOS 14.3.7. After finding signed firmware I tried using iTunes but kept getting error 9 . I found the solution in iFixit where Barry's answers stated that (in short) this is Apples way of giving trouble by removing signed firmware! However he suggested a solution that utilizes paid version of the software to flash earlier version of firmware (ISPW) into iphone, using Reiboot\nNow my iphone is completely unlocked, with my account signed in and everything is legit, yet if I restore earlier ISPW, then iTunes keep giving me error that I cant install old firmware! I need to know if there are any free tools online or Github project that can flash old firmware into iPhone? or anyway to check what is causing kernel panic.\nWhen I say old firmware i mean just one step earlier revision where my iphone didnt keep rebooting!\n\n(update 1) iOS 14.4.2 is known to have heating issue which is perhaps why my iphone is rebooting - source\n\nA: If I have to be honest (and it’s really neat that you are doing this), you probably shouldn’t install previous firmware. It’s probably rebooting for a reason. There might be some broken blocks or code. It could also be infected, possibly malware or an app that uses your device for Crypto Mining. It could also be your device. Please let me know if this helps!\n", "Q: What is the difference between Export as PDF and Export > Format: PDF (Preview) Recently I drew a simple line on a blank page in Preview. I realized, that if I export the Document via File > Export as PDF, and open the exported Document, I don't have the ability to move around and edit the line.\nIf I alternatively use File > Export and then choose 'Format: PDF' I can edit the exported file later.\nSo this lead me to the question, why there are 2 different PDF Export 'Formats' in Preview. I believe that this might pose a slight security risk, since editable PDF Documents can later be manipulated.\n\nA: Firstly, PDFs can always be edited, and if you used a decent vector artwork editor (of which Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer, Inkscape, and Picta Inc.'s Graphic are examples, and Preview is not), you would be able to move the line from either export method. There is no 'security' to be had.\nThere are certainly differences between the two types of PDF Export. File > Export As PDF will place your image onto the default paper size. This is most noticeable if you have an image that's not A4 or US Letter. File > Export > Format: PDF will keep the dimensions of the image.\nThe former type of Export keeps the line data as an annotation, whereas the latter type of export flattens the data as just a 'line' within the PDF.\nAs to why Preview has such as clumsy interface: only an Apple insider can tell you that. There are many mysteries about why Preview is such a terrible showcase for the brilliant Quartz graphics APIs that lie beneath, and we may never know.\n", "Q: Copy filename of file selected in Finder to clipboard using Automator with Applescript I'm trying to create an Automator Application that begins with selecting a Finder item.\nBefore continuing I would like to copy the filename only, not the pathname to the clipboard.\nHow can I do that?\nThanks very much in advance!\n\nA: To place the name of the Finder item without its extension onto the clipboard, you will need to add a Run AppleScript action with the following example AppleScript code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    \n    set fileName to first item of input\n    \n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        tell disk item (fileName as text) to ¬\n            set {theName, theExtension} to ¬\n                {name, name extension}\n    \n    if theExtension is not \"\" then\n        set theName to ¬\n            text 1 thru -((count theExtension) + 2) ¬\n                of theName\n        set the clipboard to theName\n    else\n        set the clipboard to theName\n    end if\n    \n    return input\n    \nend run\n\nThe return input in the example AppleScript code will pass the Finder item(s) onto the next action in the workflow.\n\nNote:\nAs coded it will only place the name of the first selected Finder item, without its extension, onto the clipboard, as per your comment.\n", "Q: Rosetta 2 is not installed on M1 The terminal writes about a successful installation, but it is nowhere to be found.

If you are sure you don’t have Rosetta and it’s not running and you did get a new Intel app after the error, one lpotential cause of that error is if your network has failed to deliver the update from Apple content delivery network (hard to tell if CDN is overloaded or it’s your network with one try, though).\nI would restart the machine and try again.

I have a 17” unibody MacBook Pro that is broken (the GPU and motherboard are gone). Is it possible to use its screen as an external display?\nI suppose it would need some kind of specific connection to feed power to the screen as well as the video.\n\nA: Imagine building yourself a monitor, and the only part you have is the screen display itself. No input port, controller circuitry, nor power supply.\nThere are not going to be easy steps that you can follow unless you can determine the OEM of the panel and dig up a kit and guide to provide a display assembly that drives that LCD panel.\n\n*\n\n*Use MacBook Pro LCD Screen as a standalone monitor\n\n*Can my Macbook Pro's display receive inputs from other sources?\n\nA: Is the screen broken? If not, you might be able to make yourself a monitor using the screen. You will need video ports and some LCD controllers. You might be able to code your own firmware for the monitor, because it might need proprietary drivers. You can practice using other screens. There is something I must advise, and that is that you will probably spend more time and money trying to build your own monitor than just buying one.

Today I bought a 2017 Macbook that has a water damaged LCD and a faulty closed-lid sensor. My intention is to factory reset it and use it as a build system (i.e. develop my app on my desktop, then remotely connect into the machine to compile / distribute).\nWhen in MacOS, I can ⌘ Command+F1 to mirror to an external display, but obviously that doesn't work in recovery mode. One suggestion was to boot to recovery, then simply close the lid to make the external display the primary display, but with a faulty \"lid closed\" sensor, I can't do that.\nAnother suggestion was to close the lid, then run a fridge magnet over the corner of the unit to activate the closed-lid sensor. I tried this, but it just puts the unit to sleep, and I need to open the lid to start it back up.\nSomeone else suggested attempting to drag the window over from one screen to another, but I tried a bunch of times and had no luck because it's a bit of a stab in the dark to hit something that thin.\nI have a dock at work that I intend to try (so I can close the lid, do the magnet, then use an external keyboard to try and wake the device), but until I can get to it, I'm wondering if there's a way to mirror the display, or at least move the window so I can proceed with reinstallation of MacOS?\n\nA: The solution that worked for me, and was suggested to me by someone over on Reddit, is to remove the bottom of the Macbook and unhook the LCD cable. Once I did that, the external screen acted just like the internal screen. I could see the Apple logo, the recovery mode welcome screen and all that jazz.\nThere's teardown instructions over on iFixit, but I didn't need to follow all the steps. I just needed to undo the screws (steps 1-8) and unhook the trackpad cable (steps 9-11) to get the case open far enough to unhook the LCD cable (steps 19-23)\n", "Q: Mac \"other\" storage super hidden I've looked through quite a few other posts about this issue and they always seem to get resolved by some iTunes or document storage that the Mac is accidentally tracking as part of the \"other\" storage. But my Mac has no files on it except for System files and Steam.\nI used it a long time ago but wiped everything clean, now there's 87GB of other files somewhere?

Before you tell me to upgrade, Mavericks is my favorite version and anything after it runs like crap.\nPlease help me fix this!\n\nA: UPDATE: I have successfully been able to fix my problem. I started off by making a Mavericks USB installer, then I made a disk image from the drive. My mistake was making a .cdr file and burning it. I tried again by making a .dmg file instead. I now have Mavericks installed. It also took significantly quicker to get into the recovery menu.\n", "Q: Delay when pressing Command-Shift-4 The better way to take a screenshot is Command-Shift-4.\nBut since switching to Big Sur on an M1 Mac, I am seeing that this key combination produces a delay before seeing the crosshairs.\nWhen a computer doesn't do what I ask right away, I do the same thing again and press harder. So how do I prevent this delay and reduce RSI?\n\nA: Open the Screenshot app, and in the Screen Recording options, select \"None\", for the audio input.\nI have no idea why, but this will fix the delay before the crosshair appears for Cmd+Shift+4 screenshots.\n\nA: Sounds like a possible hardware issue with the keyboard. You may have to bring it into an Apple store for diagnosis.\nBut if you really want to know for sure you could do a re-install or clean install of the Mac OS which would rule out any software problems.\nIf you want to try something less drastic, create a new user and log in as that user and see if you can replicate the issue.\n", "Q: Stolen Package with Ipad Pro WiFi only I purchased an Ipad Pro 12.3\" for my kid for school, and we purchased it directly with Apple. The carrier claims they delivered it and left it in the porch (we dont have a porch). Then their excuse is that Apple didnt request signature delivery so they left it at the door or porch and they cant do anything. I contacted Apple and they are doing due investigation, but I was pretty much told that they cannot block the device even if I ask for it and having the serial number which is in my receipt. Is there anyone that knows how to do this? I can check the info on the order receipt, but since it never reached us, it has no apple ID on it nor anything. It was stolen BRAND NEW on the package, or delivered to the wrong house.\n\nA: You are out of luck in terms of locking it out. If you had ordered it from a business or school registered with Apple Schoo Manager it would have been pre-associated with your organization, but as a regular consumer, with no Apple ID ever having been associated with the device, you have no ability to control or tack it.\nHowever, I suspect that Apple will send you a new one and since you had no personal info on the device I would not invest much time into tracking it or locking it.\n", "Q: Complex Appear In Keynote Presentation In my presentation, I have a slide with six lines.

But trying to reverse the process does not work; e.g., to type CTRL+J or ALT+0010 etc. Any advice on how to replace newlines in cells with, for example, space?\n\nA: Solution for some cases could be:\nCopy cell(s) (⌘ + C), paste special (⌃ + ⌘ + V), select 'Values', click 'OK'\nCaveats: there must be space at the end of line, otherwise there will be no separation between lines (it removes newline but doesn't replace); it doesn't work in-cell (source and destination cells must be different)\n\nA: Hi Aivar Paalberg and thanks for the answer. This does not work, unfortunately. It seems that Excel for Mac has a very limited capability in that respect. I think that such things work better under MS Windows.\nAnyhow, I managed to solve my problem with Apple Numbers where this becomes next to trivial: Numbers allows \\n and one can replace it with whatever s/he wants.\n", "Q: Macbook 12\" doesn't sleep/wake on close/open I bought an Macbook 12\" 2016 which doesn't want so sleep when I close the lid.

I'm running Mojave 10.14.6 on mac mini late 2014.\nIt has internal hdd drive. I bought an external ssd to speed things up and run everything from it, and use internal hdd as a data storage\\time machine\nI installed OS on ssd and am running the mac from it, but I can't seem to erase the internal hdd drive.

I often want to open the \"Sound\" System Preferences pane using Spotlight. But when I type sound it always shows \"DaftCloud for SoundCloud\" from the App Store as the top hit. I have never intentionally chosen this item. I have probably hit it a couple of times by mistake, but the vast majority of the time, I navigate one step down using the keyboard and choose \"Sound\". I rarely listen to music, and never to \"DaftCloud\" and I never use \"SoundCloud\". This top hit is weird to me. (Is Apple selling top hits on Spotlight?)\n\nI have seen claims that Spotlight can \"learn\" from user behavior. This doesn't seem to be the case here. I have even intentionally opened \"Sound\" repeatedly using Spotlight, and it still shows \"SoundCloud\" first.\nInterestingly, typing soun (without the final d) shows the \"Sound\" preference pane first, but as soon as I complete the word sound, it switches to \"SoundCloud\". (Again, is Apple selling the \"sound\" keyword?)\nAnyway, I want the \"Sound\" preference pane to be the top hit for sound. Is there any way to achieve this?\nI have explored the Spotlight \"Search Results\" settings. But they don't seem to offer a way to remove App Store suggestions. I cannot remove \"Applications\" because that will remove the \"Sound\" preferences from the results.\nSome sources claim that I should be able to drag around the \"Search Results\" in settings, but they don't move for me.\nI can force \"Sound\" preferences to the top by using the search query kind:system preferences sound, but that is absurdly long to type.\n\nA: Uncheck Siri Suggestions in System Preferences / Spotlight.\nThat should prevent SoundClound from showing up. :-)\n", "Q: How to install OSX on NVMe drive only (no SATA drive) I just pulled the 128GB NVMe SSD + 1TB disk drive (known together as a fusion drive) out of a late 2014 27\" iMac.

You have a BIOS booting Windows 10 installed on the internal drive. You should probably install Windows 10 to BIOS boot from an external drive. The instructions given in your link are for installing an EFI booting Windows on an external drive.\nBIOS booting Windows installations can only access the first 2.2 TB of the installation drive, when the sector size is 512 bytes. The may be a problem since your external HDD is 5 TB in size.\nThe Boot Camp Assistant should be able to create a USB flash drive Windows 10 installer. This installer should be bootable on your Mac. You could use this installer to try and install Windows 10 on the external drives. These drives will need to be either MBR partitioned or hybrid partitioned like the internal drive.\n\nWhile the Boot Camp Assistant can create a USB flash drive Windows 10 installer, the Boot Camp Assistant probably can not be used to install Windows 10 on an external drive. This usually requires manual installation using the Windows CLI.\n\nUPDATE\nUser Cordvision posted the question Big Sur: Booting Win10 from SSD and Disable Internal Drive. This question documents how a firmware update included with macOS has resulted in problems BIOS booting Windows from external drives. I found that on my 2013 iMac the Mac Startup Manager will not always display an icon or the correct icon for an external BIOS bootable drive. Also, when choosing to BIOS boot from an external drive, the Mac may instead try to BIOS boot from a different drive. To overcome this limitation, I installed the rEFInd Boot Manager. This is a free product.\nInstalling BIOS Booting Windows 10 on USB HDD Using 2013 iMac\nThese instructions will probably only work with 2012 though 2014 Macs.\nI do not have the same hardware as you have. This is as close as I can get. I am also using a wireless apple keyboard and mouse. I would recommend using a wired Apple keyboard and mouse during the installation. If you have any questions about what a step does, you probably should first ask for an better explanation.\nI have Catalina, High Sierra and a BIOS booting Windows 10 installed on the internal HDD. Windows 10 is installed in the partition with the identifier disk0s3. The external USB drive does not have any operating systems installed. I will be installing a BIOS booting Window 10 the partition with the identifier disk2s3.

Below is an image of my selection from Boot Camp Assistant included with Catalina. Do not use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10. Only create the flash drive installer from the download Windows 10 ISO file. This file can be download from this Windows website. The file I downloaded was named Win10_20H2_English_x64.iso.\n\nWhen finished, check to see if the root folder on the flash drive contains the file named AutoUnattend.xml. If found, change the name to NoAutoUnattend.xml.\n\n\n*Download and install the rEFInd Boot Manager from the SourceForge rEFInd website. Here I will assume the downloaded zip file was expanded to the folder refind-bin-0.13.2. If you have a different folder, then make the appropriate substitutions. Note: The diskutil commands may state the volume is already unmounted and the refund-install script will produce an error message with respect to either the sed or bless command.\n\nNote: disk0s1 is the EFI partition on my Mac's internal drive. If this is not true in your case, then make the appropriate substitutions. In addition, you can use the EFI partition on the drive where you are installing Windows 10, as an alternative location for rEFInd.\n\ncd ~/Downloads\nxattr -rc refind-bin-0.13.2\ncd refind-bin-0.13.2\ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk0s1\n./refind-install --usedefault /dev/disk0s1\necho \"scanfor biosexternal\" >> /Volumes/EFI/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf \ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk0s1\n\n\n\n*Shutdown the Mac. Remove all external drive except the Windows 10 installer flash drive. Start the Mac and immediately hold down the option key until the Mac Startup Manager icons appear. Highlight the external drive icon labeled EFI Boot, then select the arrow under this icon. This will boot to Mac from the Windows 10 installer flash drive. Below is a image similar to the external drive icon you will see.\n\n\n\n*The first window to appear should be similar to the one shown below. At this point, you can plug in the drive where Windows will be installed.\n\nProceed as one would for a GUI installation of Windows. When a window similar to the one shown below appears, press the shift+F10 key combination.\n\nNote: If you press the shift+F10 key combination before the image below appears, then the Windows installer may not have loaded drivers from the Windows Support Software.\n\n\nThe result should be the appearance of the Command Prompt window shown below.\n\n\n\n*Enter the command given below to determine the drive letters.\necho list vol | diskpart\n\nIn this example, drives d: and f: were determined to be the ExFAT volume on the Windows installer flash drive and the ExFAT volume where Windows will be installed, respectively. If your drive letters are different, then make the appropriate substitutions in the remaining steps.\n\n\n*If necessary, enter the command below to get the names of the available Windows installations.\ndism /get-imageinfo /imagefile:d:\\sources\\install.wim\n\nIn this example, the name Windows 10 Pro will be used. If you choose a different name, then make the appropriate substitution in the following step.\n\n\n*Enter the following commands to begin installing a BIOS booting Windows 10.\n\nNote: the first dism command will take a long time to complete. You should ignore any error messages from the second dism command.\n\nformat f: /q /v:BootCamp /fs:ntfs\ndism /apply-image /imagefile:d:\\sources\\install.wim /name:\"Windows 10 Pro\" /applydir:f:\\ /checkintegrity\ndism /image:f:\\ /add-driver /driver:d:\\$WinPEDriver$ /recurse /forceunsigned\nbcdboot f:\\windows /l en-us /s f: /f bios\nbootsect /nt60 f: /mbr\nexit\n\nWhen finished , close the Windows Setup window by clicking on the red box with the X mark. In the next window, select Repair your computer, then Turn off your PC. After the Mac turns off, remove the flash drive.\n\n\n*Start the Mac and immediately hold down the option key until the Mac Startup Manager icons appear. Highlight the internal drive icon labeled EFI Boot. Below is a image similar to the internal drive icon you will see.\n\nHowever, if you installed rEFInd to an external drive, then you should instead highlight the external drive icon labeled EFI Boot. Below is a image similar to the external drive icon you will see.\n\nNext, hold down the control to change the straight arrow to a circular arrow. Select this circular arrow to boot the Mac to the rEFInd Boot Manager. With the icon shown below highlighted on the rEFInd display, press the return key. If the icon does not appear, then press the esc key to refresh.\n\n\n\n*Finish installing Windows 10. The computer will automatically reboot to rEFInd, then Windows 10 on the external drive. When finished installing Windows 10, plug in the Windows 10 installer flash drive and execute the Setup application in the BootCamp folder on the flash drive. Afterwards, eject and remove the Windows 10 installer flash drive before restarting the Mac.\n\n\n*There should be an Apple Software Update application installed on your Mac. Execute this application to get updates from Apple. I would recommend installing any updates to Apple Software Update first.\n\n\n*Finally, check with Windows Update for any additional (optional) driver and other software updates.\nAdditional References\nMan page of gdisk\nMan page of refind-install\nDISM Image Management Command-Line Options\nDISM Driver Servicing (.inf) Command-Line Options\nBCDBoot Command-Line Options\nBootsect Command-Line Options\nBIOS/MBR-based hard drive partitions\nThe rEFInd Boot Manager\nThe rEFInd Boot Manager: Configuring the Boot Manager\nThe rEFInd Boot Manager: Using rEFInd\n", "Q: MacBook M1 Big Sur crashes every time when I open \"About This Mac -> Storage -> Manage\" Background: I'm using a MacBook Pro with M1 chip and Big Sur V11.1 (got it last month).

Is this true?\nBut Optimise Mac Storage means full content of the iCloud Drive will be stored on the Mac.\nSo it seems that's already a way to backup the iCloud.\nDoes this mean I have to choose whether to back it up to the Mac or to Time Machine?\nWhich would be better?\nEdit:\nOne reason for my confusion is because before I posted here originally, I was searching online, and I read that Time machine will backup iCloud drive , even if \"Optimise Mac Storage\" is turned off ...... and that it actually -should- be turned off for time machine to backup iCloud Drive more effectively ....\nHere is the original quote I had read: \"Time Machine will backup iCloud Drive, as long as you have not enabled \"Optimise Mac Storage\". If \"Optimise ...\" is enabled, it will be a game of chance, which documents have been downloaded from iCloud are locally available on your computer, when Time Machine is running.\"\nAnother edit :\nSo if that's true, and optimise Mac storage is turned off, time machine backing up iCloud, from the answer below, it still wouldn't be backing up Notes specifically ?\nClarifying:\nFrom the answer below, I can conclude that optimise Mac storage turned on won't save notes to time machine,\nbut what if it (optimise Mac storage) is turned off, would time machine backup iCloud (or iCloud Drive?)

It's not one or the other, it's ‘only iCloud’ or ‘iCloud and locally’.\nHowever, the premise that Optimise Mac Storage controls the storage of notes locally is false. That setting controls iCloud Drive, which Notes does not participate in. Notes has its own category of iCloud storage and there is no way to guarantee all notes are stored locally.\nNotes stores a cache of recently used iCloud notes in\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Caches/CloudKit\n\nThis destination is excluded from Time Machine by default.\n$ tmutil isexcluded ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/D*/L*/Cac*/C*\n[Excluded] …\n\nTherefore Time Machine will not back up this folder even if it did contain all your notes.\n", "Q: Where in System Preferences do I find how to enable system extensions?

When determining what's eating up my cellular data I look at data usage in the settings app. There the biggest consumer by far is \"system services\" and inside that item \"safari services\" is responsible for 95% of all usage.\nThis doesn't really tell me anything useful. What is Safari services? Who is it providing services for? Safari? 3rd party apps? Me? I assume it's not to me or Safari since then I don't see why the data isn't just listed under the Safari app directly, and the same thing if it's to 3rd party apps. If neither then I don't see why it's such a big consumer of data to begin with.\nHow do I cut down on its data consumption?\niOS 14.4 on iPhone 8\n\nA: According to Apple, Safari Services is a framework that application developers can utilize to integrate Safari behaviors and features into their applications. For example, when you open a link in Discord (a messaging app), it opens in a mini version of Safari, from which you can quickly return to your chat, or open the link in the 'full version' of Safari.\n\nYou might be seeing excessive data usage if you frequently open data-heavy websites like YouTube through other apps like Twitter, for example. I should note, however, that I tested this on my phone, running iOS 14.5 (18E5199a) and could not find the mentioned \"Safari Services\" category; instead, I see the relevant data usage attributed to Safari itself. It's possible that there has been a recent change regarding this behavior.\n\n\nA: If you go to settings, try the following set up and see if it works.\nSettings->Safari\n\n*\n\n*General\n\nBlock Pop-ups Yes\n\n\n*Privacy & Security\n\nPrevent Cross-Site Tracking Yes\nFraudulent Website Warning Yes\nThen clear all your History and Website Data\n\n\n*Settings for Website\n\nSet Ask option fro Camera, Microphone and Location.\n\n\n*Reading List\n\nAutomatically save Offline No\nI Have this main settings and don't experience any issues.\n\nA: Safari Services seems to refer to things like tabs syncing via iCloud, considering that after I turn off Safari under iCloud its data consumption stops. When I turn it on again it quickly rises to the top data consumer under System Services.\nSince \"iCloud\" already has its own separate item under System Services this terminology seems unnecessarily misleading.\n", "Q: Mac OS X tiger not installing on iMac G5 late 2005 I’ve tried pressing/holding down c,x,control,alt,command and everything, and it still hasn’t worked. I’ve tried downloading even the ISO of the disk that came with it, and it still hasn’t worked. I’ve been trying for two days, is there any solution to this?\n\nA: Probably the medium you have inserted is not bootable by your computer. You can use an USB drive for the reinstallation of Mac OS 10.4 . However, if I recall right, iMac G5 is capable of running 10.5 Leopard as well. It doesn't really matter. I am gonna continue this answer with the assumption of you have a disk image of either 10.4 or 10.5, as well as your mac is currently working or you have access to another mac; since you have mentioned you downloaded the disk image in question itself.\nPreparation of installation drive:\n\n*\n\n*Find an USB drive, with 8gb or more storage.\n\n*Insert it into the USB port of your computer.\n\n*Open up Disk Utility.\n\n*Select your drive and go to erase section.\n\n*Select \"OSX Extended (Journaled) as your disk format and hit erase. (This will delete everything on the thumb-drive, thus make sure that you don't have anything valuable within the USB drive.)\n\n*When it finishes, right click on mounted drive and select get info.\n\n*Go to \"Sharing and Permissions\" section of poped up window.\n\n*Click the lock and enter your password.\n\n*Uncheck the setting \"Ignore ownership on this volume\".\n\n￼\n\n\n*Click the lock again in order to save the change you have just made.\n\n*Mount the dmg file of the Mac OSX installation (you can copy from the installation disk or download it from internet.)\n\n*Open up the Disk Utility again, this time select the partition you have created in step 5.\n\n*Go to restore section.\n\n*Select mounted DMG file (not the file itself the mounted image) as the source.\n\n*Hit restore.\n\nBooting with the thumb-drive:\n\n*\n\n*Boot/Restart your iMac with \"CMD+OPTION+O+F\" keys pressed.\n\n*Type devalias and press enter.\n\n*On the bottom of response from the command in step 2 you will see a drive named ud.\n\n*In order to boot from your drive, type boot ud:,\\\\:tbxi\n\n*You should be able to boot from the USB drive.\n\nInstallation of Mac OSX:\n\n*\n\n*You should be greeted with the welcome screen.\n\n*Proceed the installation by clicking continue.\n\n*Select your hard drive, and click options.\n\n*Select \"Erase and install\". Make sure the format is selected as \"OSX Extended (Journaled)\".\n\n*Click continue, and it should be installed.\n\nHope if helps, the process of creating USB drive of 10.4 , 10.5 etc. can be done via any other Mac. Steps are the same.\nPs: Sorry for lack of images during the process. I am using Mojave right now so your screen responses might vary. Only the get info screen is pretty much the same as the \"kitten\" era of Mac OSX.\n", "Q: Why is ~/.zprofile always sourced on every interactive session? from zsh document, ~/.zprofile should only be sourced at login shell, and should NOT be sourced at every interactive session (for example, a new tab in a terminal).\n\n*\n\n*I am running MacOS Big Sur 11.2.3 (20D91).\n\nBut I can confirm that my ~/.zprofile is sourced at every interactive session (a new tab). Why is that? Is this a bug? How to stop this incorrect behavior?\n\nA: Each Terminal tab is a login session on macOS by default. You can run w to see that each tab/tty running a shell has a process name starting with - attached to it (which indicates a login shell).\nAdditional information (related to bash, but the same is applicable to other shells)\n\n*\n\n*What options does Terminal pass to bash on startup?\n\n*Why doesn't .bashrc run automatically? (some of the answers explain details)\n\n*What are the differences between /usr/bin/login and /usr/bin/bash?\n\n*Why doesn't Mac OS X source ~/.bashrc?\nPS: If I remember correctly we have a Q&A which goes into even more detail on this including a rationale why macOS considers each Terminal window/tab to be a login shell. I didn't find it yet though...\n", "Q: Removing free partition on Macbook Macintosh HD Let me tell you the story to understand the problem.\nI installed Ubuntu 20.04 on my mac as the second OS. Later I decided to delete it, and being not good in all this stuff, I decided to just remove the 30gb partition I gave for Ubuntu. However, EFI partition was left.\nI downloaded Paragon and erased this EFI. But it is not merged still with my Macintosh HD!\n\nSo my question is how to merge it (include literally the 314.57 Mb partition) with my hard disk (APFS-container)?\nI tried to format it as HFS+ and then tried to make it APSF but my system felt and I had to install macOS again.\nP.S. Disk Utility says that there is a trouble and to repair it, I need to go to recovery mode. But when I go to RM, it says the same thing - even though I turned off filevault as some sources say.\nI will be very thankful to you for your response!\n\nA: You a not suppose to remove the EFI partition. This partition was created when macOS was installed. To remove the Ubuntu files from the FA32 formatted volume stored in this partition, take the following steps.\n\nNote: I realize, it is to late for you to follow these steps. I post the steps for others who may have the same question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to macOS and open a Terminal application window.\n\n\n*Enter the command below to mount the volume stored in the EFI partition. This volume will have the name EFI.\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\n\n\n\n*Use the Finder application to remove the EFI/BOOT and EFI/ubuntu folders from the EFI volume.\n\n\n*Enter the command below to unmount the volume stored in the EFI partition.\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\n\n", "Q: Magic Trackpad 2 jumpy and erratic unless plugged in Although the trackpad is fully charged, it's not working properly when not plugged in. Apple says to start in Safe mode but even that didn't work. I've tried turning off bluetooth then back on again. Is there a solution other than just keeping it plugged in from now on? I don't live near an Apple store unfortunately.\n\nA: I have noticed the exact same behavior on my Magic Trackpad.\nRebooting, disabling/enabling bluetooth didn't work, however (while trackpad is unplugged, but connected via Bluetooth) toggling the physical switch on the back of the trackpad off and on again does seem to resolve it somehow.\n\nA: All depends on dry air, it seems to need air humidity above 30% to work smothly.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a paid application which makes use of an Automator service? The functionality of my application is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Get highlighted text from any application in macOS.\n\n*Do some processing on it, including interaction with a server.\n\n*Show output as a dialog on macOS.\n\nI know that we can read the highlighted text from any application if we use a Mac Automator service. This pretty much works for me with only one caveat. The Automator service can be read and modified by anyone. I would like to distribute this as a paid application. Hence, I would prefer that my application not be modified or even read by anyone.\nIs it possible to do so?\nI'm fine with using something other than an Automator if the functionality written above is satisfied.\n\nA: Yes, it is definitely possible.\nI don't think the logic that it is necessary that a paid application is opaque and static is true. It is entirely possible to sell software while providing access to the source code and letting the customer modify it. Software has been sold that way by large and small companies for decades.\nIf you really want a technical solution, you can use obfuscation to hide the plain text of scripting languages such as AppleScript. Some languages have an eval-like functionality enabling you to deobfuscate source code and run it directly, whereas for AppleScript you probably want to store it in a seperate object file and run it - or employ OSAKit to be able to run the source directly.\nMost programmers in closed-souce, commercial software would probably not employ such \"tricks\", but rather go for a compilable language such as Swift, Objective-C, C++ or similar to get an executeable that is not immediately \"readable\" by humans.\nNote that all software that can be run can also be reverse-engineered.\n", "Q: Safari redirecting to http instead of https When using Safari 14.0.3 on Mojave, if I paste https://gramhum.com in the address bar, I am redirected to greatfon.com, but the \"https://\" part disappears and the query is sent unencrypted via port 80. It is blocked by the firewall, so it fails.\nI have to manually retype the URL to make it work. Same thing happens if I click the link inside an HTML file.\nThe option \"Show full website address\" is enabled, and if I replace https://gramhum.com with https://greatfon.com, it works.\nI have no problem with Firefox and Chrome (these browsers redirect properly to https://greatfon.com).\n\nA: I wonder if you may be seeing a feature that was a bit controversial when Apple introduced it, namely, not showing the full website address.\nIf you go to Safari > Preferences > Advanced and check \"Show full website address.\" and then once you are on \"https://anywebsite.com\" just click once in the address field. That should show everything including the http/https string.\nDoes that solve your issue?

Disk Utility and fsck says\n\nMissing directory record (id = 33496403)\n\nWhat can I do now?\nEl Capitan on MacBook Pro late 2008.\n\nA: If you have a backup I'd recommend formatting the drive, reinstalling macOS and restoring from backup.\nIf you don't have a backup you could try 3rd party tools like Alsoft DiskWarrior or Micromat TechTool to repair the volume. Alternatively you could manually back up data via Terminal or by booting from an external drive (and using Finder) if the volume still mounts.\n\nA: You will need your second mac, If you don't have one, borrow one from your friend. In the other mac, Make a Bootable USB Installer for OS X El Capitan\nIn your MacBook Pro 2008, Attach the Bootable USB, Boot your mac while pressing Option(Alt) key. Select the Boot Disk. The name will be Install OSX El Capitan. Open Disk Utility. Select the internal drive and click Erase.\nIn the pop-up menu (OS X Extended should be selected), enter a name, then click Erase.\nOnce it's done formatting, Close Disk Utility, Select Install OS X.

Once it's done downloading, it will reboot, once it's finished installing, do the setup.\n", "Q: How do I make a bootable USB out of .bin file I was following the instructions in https://createyourownos.blogspot.com/ to make my own tiny OS. I managed to do the compile and the assemble step, but how can I make a bootable USB out of .bin file?\n\nA: It is not in general possible to create a bootable USB from any \".bin\" file.\nAs per your comments you are not willing to detail how you arrived at the \".bin\" file, how it was created, what it contains, or anything like that - we can then conclude that it is not possible for you to create a bootable USB from this \".bin\" file.\nUPDATE: You have since updated your comments with the source of your \".bin\" file being from a specific blog-tutorial on making a simple operating system. In this case your operating system is 32-bit, where Macs today commonly boot 64-bit software. Your operating system also relies on the BIOS to actually do something, but this is not the way modern computers work.\nI would suggest to you to keep using qemu or similar to boot your operating system in. Alternatively, buy an old, simple PC that you can tinker with. This will give you fewest headaches.\nAlternatively, you need to ensure that the Mac enables the legacy BIOS CSM (compatibility support module) while booting. This can be done by ensure your disk has one of the old MBR partition tables (i.e. not GPT) and that your partition is set as bootable. You operating system then needs to moved into that partition accordingly.\nDepending on how old your Mac is, you probably want to go along the road of loading rEFIt in first, and install the old legaby-BIOS version of GRUB 2 as a boot chain to ultimately boot your OS.\nIf you have the newest M1 Mac, you operating system cannot work at all due to it being 32-bit Intel only. If you have a newer Mac with T2, you'll need to relax secure boot restrictions in order to get going.\n", "Q: MacBook goes to sleep when I keep a bluetooth speaker on top of it This is kind of a weird question. Since the last year, I have observed multiple times that when I keep my bluetooth speaker on top of my mac, near the trackpad, it suddenly turns off and goes to sleep.\nThis happens quite frequently but not always.\nI am using MacBook Pro 2012 mid and my bluetooth speaker is beetel s2. Also I connect my speaker to mac with aux cable and not bluetooth (sound flickers in case of bluetooth connection).\n\nA: The MacBook detects your lid being closed with a magnet. Speakers also have a magnet, thats how they work.\nWhen you put your speaker on your Mac, it \"thinks\" the lid was being closed and goes to sleep.\n", "Q: iMessage - How to block SMS from contacts without phone numbers? I am sometimes getting SMS messages in iMessage app from empty contacts. Such contact has a name (even it’s not in my contacts), but doesn’t have a phone number or email address. Hence, “Block this Caller” doesn’t work.\nBonus question:\nHow it is possible that Messages app accepts such SMS messages anyway?\nMain question\nHow to block such SMS messages or enable some option that will prevent SMS without a phone number?\nHere is an example of such empty contact. No phone number, no email - “Block” button doesn’t work.\n\n\nA: SMS delivery is something your cellular carrier has the most control over. They make money delivering SMS so the trick is to convince them to let you not receive “fake” sms with bogus caller ID. That really varies by carrier and region so once you’re sure you’ve configured you SMS service as you want it, then the iOS settings are next best thing to try.\n\n*\n\n*Contact your carrier - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204039\n\n*Use Apple settings - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201229\nFiltering all unknown SMS and using do not disturb work best for me, but you may have to experiment with the controls to find your best mix of getting messages you want, not seeing those you don’t need to see immediately and engaging blocks on ones that are annoying pests.\nIn the end, you can’t block a number that doesn’t get reported correctly from the carrier or that you don’t know. Apple has a service added to allow third party applications to screen your calls - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099  but this doesn’t (yet) work for potentially screening junk messages.\n", "Q: Graphics glitch - checkered pattern in Chrome I've had this MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) for a while now, but today it glitched out with huge green fields in all apps.\nAfter a reboot I see this checkered black/green glitch pattern in Google Chrome on some sites, in some \"sizes\".

Example: no social media, he hasn't sent me a message, no email, etc. I know that the iPhone pulls pictures from many places but in this case, we don't have anything in common.\nHow would his picture appear on my phone under his contact name?\n\nA: You can remove any contact photo from the contacts app. It’s going to be hard for us to guess your setup without sitting shoulder to shoulder and reviewing all the places you could have added an account. The likely culprit is the other person chose to share that image with you when asked by Apple permission to share their name and icon. They may not be aware this happens or mistakenly tapped the allow button while they were putting the phone in their pocket.

What I would do is create a new folder inside Pictures and place my image files in there.\nYou can use the Photos app to browse your library in the directories you placed in the new folder under Pictures. If you would like to not use the Photos dedicated library, you can remove that option in the Preferences of Photos under General > Importing > Copy items to the Photos library. Make sure iCloud Photos is deselected under the iCloud tab in Photos.\n\nA: You can make a folder that contains several sub-folders. And let's just call this folder HDD-Photos. So we create a folder within ~/Pictures, otherwise everything is confusing.\nUse the terminal and use it to create a subdirectory of ~/Pictures\nmkdir ~/Pictures/HDD-Photos\n\nSwitch to the removable medium, the hard drive from which you want to transfer your data to the Mac afterwards.\ncd /Volumes/HDD-Photos\n\nCopy all files from the removable medium to the HDD-Photos folder\ncp -R * ~/Pictures/HDD-Photos\n\nNote: If you don't want to work with the terminal, that's no problem either. You can import the photos/ videos from the removable medium into the folder of your choice in the Finder using drag & drop\n\nYou can also import all of your photos & videos into the macOS photo library. To do this, simply open the directory with the ending \".photoslibrary\" to open the Photos application. When you have this open you can press SHIFT + CMD + I. Now a Finder window opens where you can import your file.\nPlease note, however, that all of your videos and images are then stored in one directory. You can also select certain images from the photo library and save them in an album in the sidebar of the photo library. You can save multiple albums and store photos or videos on them.\nIf you prefer the variant above where everything is separated from each other, you can of course take the one above.\n", "Q: Is there a way to merge Safari history databases?

Specifically is there a process I can used to take one set of backup files (History.db-shm, History.db-wal, and History.db) and merge them into another set?\n\nA: Keep one set in Safari and insert the other into another browser and then import it in Safari.\nChrome should work fine for that. https://github.com/Roman2K/hist_safari2chrome\nCreate a db file for Chrome and replace the empty one under the folder for Chromium in ~/Library.\nQuit Chrome and import History in Safari.\n\nBetter way is to use sqlite to merge them.. but I'm illiterate in that language.\n", "Q: Comparing Time Machine backups with Beyond Compare? Would it be safe to compare Time Machine backups with Beyond Compare? Or would Beyond Compare somehow corrupt the backups? Thanks\n\nA: Beyond Compare would not corrupt your Time Machine backups so long as you just compare files and folders, but it would certainly corrupt the backups if you use any features which alter your data.\nAnd, from what is on the Beyond Compare web site there is nothing to suggest that it is aware of the specifics of how TM writes to the destination disk.\nSo between lack of awareness of TM formats and risk of modifying/corrupting the backup, I recommend you not use Beyond Compare.\nFor functionality and safety, it is much better to use a tool designed for Time Machine.  That means BackupLoupe, as @mmmmmm has suggested. BackupLoupe reads the TM destination and builds its own database of the content.  Under no circumstances can it modify your TM backup.\nAs well as making it easy to find significant changes, BackupLoupe includes a search capability to assist when finding files to recover.\n", "Q: how to restore Desktop files from iCloud Basically I signed out and in my apple Id to fix some handoff issues....\nBut I just noticed that all my files on Desktop DISAPPEAR !!!\nI have the desktop folder in my iCloud but not sure what happens..\nI restarted the laptop but won't fix..\nTrash bin doesn't have the files from desktop either...\n2018 Macbook Pro, OS: latest Big Sur\n\nA: System Preferences... -> iCloud -> Options -> iCloud Drive -> Select the checkbox for Desktop & Document Folders.\n\nA: If you would like to store your Desktop and Documents folders in iCloud, make sure the feature is selected in System Preferences > Apple ID > iCloud Drive (Options) > Desktop and Documents Folders.\nIf this option is selected and you still don’t see your Desktop and Documents folders in the desktop of your Mac but still see these similarly titled folders inside of your iCloud folder, then what you can do is drag and drop the files you would like to have on your desktop and the same for the Documents folder.\n", "Q: How do I tap on bottom right to trigger a secondary click? Similar to Tap with two fingers for a \"right-click\" or secondary click but I want tap bottom right for secondary click?\nThey only have the option for Click\n\n\nA: What you need is BetterTouchTool. I use it to define actions for taps in corners of my trackpad, but it knows abut middle of top and bottom of trackpad. It can do taps, swipes and gestures with up to 5 fingers.  It is so configurable that what it does is only limited by your imagination or your ability to remember what you have configured.\nThis was also the answer to Triple finger tap for middle click.\n", "Q: Are messages included in iCloud System backup if iCloud Messages is disabled? With iCloud Backup, there are two ways data is stored: Apps Using iCloud and Backups.\nThe Backups portion is the equivalent of a full backup performed iTunes.\nApps Using iCloud is app data written to the cloud storage, but accessible by apps and services outside of restoring your phone from a backup.\nOn iOS, it is possible to have your Photo Library backed up with the system backup while keeping iCloud Photo Library feature turned off.\nWhen browsing the system backup options, Photo Library appears as an option but Messages does not. This leads me to believe that Messages could be excluded from the system backup.\nIf iCloud Messages as a service is turned off, are Messages data still included in the iCloud full system backup of the phone?\n\nA: Your Messages will only be backed up to Messages in iCloud if that is enabled.\nIf you disable Messages in iCloud, then Messages will backup to iCloud Backup if it's enabled and Messages are enabled specifically for the backup (this is the switch in your iCloud Backup settings).\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207428\n\nA: I don't believe so - if you back up to a computer, everything is backed up as a full system image. When you back up to iCloud, it doesn't actually take a full system image (which in some cases could be hundreds of gigabytes in size), it establises what is backed up in iCloud, what you've selected as an option, and backs up your settings and app data, but not the whole system.\nWhich is why when you restore from an iCloud backup, you have to wait for your apps to download again, unlike if you restore from a computer backup where it's all immediately there.\nIf you want your iMessages backed up, you need to select the option.\n", "Q: Can't Access Move.mil on MacBook I am currently trying to connect to move.mil and safari won't let me use it because it is not receiving \"valid\" certificates from it, how do I bypass this because I used to use this site all the time on my windows computer but now I can't on my MacBook\n\nA: The certificate issue is not your fault and there’s nothing to bypass.

A simple delay command with an appropriate value could be used instead, but with the include delay of a tenth of a second in the repeat loops it shouldn't have to wait any longer than need be. In other words, I'd only use simple delay command if I want to slow the script down from going through the various events of the UI. It's doubtful that it would need to be adjusted, but obviously do so as/if necessary.\nIf the timeout is reached, the script aborts at that point without any error message. The single-line if i ≥ 20 then return statements can be turned into a full if block and include an error message via the display dialog, display alert, or display notification command as wanted.\n", "Q: VS Code Icon not updated in Big Sur I'm on macOS 11.2.3 (20D91).

However the battery life is nowhere near the 24 hours Apple says.\nI took notes, and got 9½ hours of listen time, before the Charging Case was empty (5%; no longer charging the Airpods). Once the Case is empty, the Airpods slowly discharge, inside the Case, at around 6% per hour. This appears to be the case for others, but this would mean they would be empty within a day.\nI exclusively use them when walking the dog, so 4 times a day, for about 30 minutes. I get only 4 days of use out of them, before I have to recharge them.\nMy question is; Is it normal to get so few hours out of them, with my usage pattern? Or should I have them checked out, by the store, under warranty? I know the 24 hour they promise is under ideal conditions, but getting around half that seems odd. Other than this, I'm really liking my Airpods.\nSome additional info:\n\n*\n\n*My volume is always below 50%\n\n*I have them connected to my iPhone 8 (which supports Bluetooth 5 AFIK)\n\n*\"hey siri\" is disabled\n\n*I only listen to podcasts (Overcast App)\n\n*After walking for half an hour, the Airpods charge is around 90-93%, which is about right (10% of 5 hours = half an hour). When I put them in their case, and wait for them to charge up again, the case looses 6-8%. One would expect this to be only 2-3%.\n\n*I measured charging only the case with a generic Charger Doctor, and got 326mAh of current usage (5% -> 100%).\n\n*One would expect the case to add 19 hours of usage (i.e. 24h total - 5h for the Airpods themselves). So I get exactly halve.\n\n*I tried looking this up, but everyone is only talking about the battery like of the airpods themselves (5h), not the case (or both combined).\n\n*(I don't live near a Apple store)\n\n\nA: Apple:\n\nA single charge provides up to 4.5 hours of listening time or up to\n3.5 hours of talk time on your AirPods Pro. If you charge AirPods Pro for 5 minutes in the charging case, you will get about 1 hour of\nlistening time or about 1 hour of talk time.\n\nAs mentioned in the comments:\n\nNo, it's not normal battery life. You should just return and replace\nthem\n\nNote: Telephoning, for example, puts a particularly heavy load on the battery, but even listening to music usually brings the editorial staff's Airpods to their knees after just under an hour and a half.\n", "Q: Format and Restore Mac from Time Machine, without disturbing Bootcamp I want to format my Mac's internal drive, but I have Bootcamp installed and I don't want to disturb it.\nIs it possible to take a backup using Time Machine and then format the Mac, later restore the entire Mac from Time Machine without affecting Bootcamp?\nIf yes, How do I do it?\n\nA: Apple does not document how to do this, so you would need to be very careful and know how to erase a portion of the Mac. And yes, it’s technically possible to selectively erase and then reinstall macOS if you have a good second system to rescue things if you render your system drive in-bootable.\nThere’s no easy way to document foolproof steps, but lots of dual and triple boot expertise here. If you have a 100% surefire way to back up everything and restore it - including windows, you can proceed to experiment. You will be using commands with no undo in this step, so you might spend less time working on being able to reinstall Windows and follow Apple’s much easier erase and restore process.

Finally, these URLs are passed into the following Applescript for loading:\n# input is the list of url's from the previous task\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    # The below is an applescript loop\n    repeat with theURL in input\n        tell application \"Google Chrome\" to open location theURL\n    end repeat\n\n    # We must return something so we just return the input\n    return input\n\n end run\n\nWhen I actually run it, it sometimes works. Other times it does nothing (Chrome is running but has no window or tab loaded) or it opens the 3 new tabs along with whatever tabs were already open when the app was run.\nAt first I thought perhaps it was being affected by a browser preference which tells Chrome what you would like to have open on startup. I initially had Chrome set to open Gmail. I changed this preference to open only a blank new tab. This did not affect the results (except that when the app otherwise runs successfully now there is an additional blank new tab open, which isn't ideal but I don't care about much).\n\nA: If an application is what you want, then the following example AppleScript code can be saved as an AppleScript application in Script Editor:\nset myURLs to {\"https://www.example.com\", ¬\n    \"https://www.apple.com\", ¬\n    \"https://apple.stackexchange.com\"}\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    activate\n    close windows\n    set winID to id of (make new window)\n    tell window id winID\n        set URL of active tab to first item of myURLs\n        repeat with i from 2 to (length of myURLs)\n            make new tab at end of tabs ¬\n                with properties {URL:item i of myURLs}\n        end repeat\n        set active tab index to 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: Even though another answer was already selected as the accepted answer, it never hurts to view alternate techniques, which return the same desired results.\nproperty theURL : {\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applescript\", ¬\n    \"https://stackexchange.com/\", \"https://apple.stackexchange.com\"}\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    activate\n    close every window\n    tell its (make new window)\n        set URL of tab 1 to theURL's item 1\n        repeat with i from 2 to count of theURL\n            set URL of (make new tab) to theURL's item i\n        end repeat\n        set active tab index to 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: zshrc file invisible in finder but present in terminal When I give ls-a in my root folder I can actually see zshrc.\nbut when I open my root folder in finder using the open . command, It's not visible.

I can't find it in the finder.\n\nA: According to Wikipedia:\n\nIn computing, a hidden folder (sometimes hidden directory) or hidden file is a folder or file which filesystem utilities do not display by default when showing a directory listing.\n\nThe ls command, of course, is a directory listing. The -a option \"do not ignore entries starting with .\" (ls man page)\nSo, yes the file is invisible, or hidden.

I am trying to write a script to record an audio file and save it to a different script bundle - \"PlayPro.scptd\" - with the name passed to the script from an Excel file. The path - savePath - seems to be correct but it doesn't work. It does nothing when I run it. Here is my script:\non RecordM4a(RecordName)    \n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set r to POSIX path of ((container of (path to me) as text))\n        set r2 to \"PlayPro/Contents/Resources/AudioFiles/\"\n        set savePath to r & r2 & RecordName\n        display dialog savePath\n        tell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n            activate\n            set doku to new audio recording\n            start doku\n            delay 4\n            stop doku\n            set newDoc to last item of (documents whose name contains \"Untitled\")\n            export newDoc in file savePath using settings preset \"Audio Only\"\n            close newDoc saving no\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    tell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n        if it is running then\n            quit\n        end if\n    end tell    \nend RecordM4a\n\n\nA: Try this. The key issue is probably that you did not include the script bundle extension in r2, which makes savePath incorrect.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set recName to \"audio_rec.m4a\"\n    set pathName to (container of (path to me)) as text\n    --> \"MacHD:Users:username:Desktop:\" \nend tell\n\nset appName to \"PlayPro.scptd\"\nset intPath to \":Contents:Resources:AudioFiles:\"\n\nset afPath to pathName & appName & intPath\n--> \"MacHD:Users:username:Desktop:PlayPro.scptd:Contents:Resources:AudioFiles:\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to open afPath\nset savePathName to afPath & recName\n--> MacHD:Users:username:Desktop:PlayPro.scptd:Contents:Resources:AudioFiles:audio_rec.m4a\"\n\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    activate\n    set doku to new audio recording\n    start doku\n    delay 4\n    stop doku\n    set untDoc to front document\n    export untDoc in file savePathName using settings preset \"Audio Only\" with replacing\n    close untDoc saving no\nend tell\n\nNB I didn't see any intent for requiring posix paths so I removed them. Unless you expect some other script to meddle with your quicktime player windows, you can simplify that reference. I'm assuming that the folder 'AudioFiles' exists already, and that the destination script bundle is in the same folder as this script.\nAs an aside, why an Excel file? It might be worth considering using csv, which would be easier to get the string from and probably make your process quicker overall as you don't have to deal with Excel just to acquire a few characters. Finally, on the matter of making a good question, it is helpful when the details include what happens. 'It didn't work' isn't helpful at all — you wouldn't have asked the question if it worked. For example, your problem here isn't with quicktime player — as you suggested, it's about referencing a folder correctly.\n", "Q: Can't move files or folders to some positions As you can see in the below video, I can not move files or folders to some positions on desktop.

Now, the only solution I've found is a hack that uses a keyboard shortcut to toggle the condition of Do Not Disturb. This won't work for me because I don't know in advance the state of the setting before I run the app and I specifically want to turn it off when the app is run (later I'll turn it back on).\nIf there's no way to specifically turn Do Not Disturb on or off, then I suppose what I need to know is how to ascertain the current state of the setting and only execute the keyboard shortcut if it is not in the desired state.\n\nA: This is not as elegant as I was hoping for but it seems to work.\nAfter playing with the Record feature for a while, I seem to be able to turn DND on when it's off:\n-- Click the “Notification Center” menu bar item.\ndelay 1.109957\nset timeoutSeconds to 0.0\nset uiScript to \"click menu bar item \\\"Notification Center\\\" of menu bar 1 of application process \\\"SystemUIServer\\\"\"\nmy doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)\n\n-- Click the “<fill in title>” button.\ndelay 2.096055\nset timeoutSeconds to 0.0\nset uiScript to \"click UI Element 3 of group \\\"Do Not Disturb\\\" of scroll area 1 of window \\\"Notification Center\\\" of application process \\\"Notification Center\\\"\"\nmy doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)\n\non doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)\n    set endDate to (current date) + timeoutSeconds\n    repeat\n        try\n            run script \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\"\n\" & uiScript & \"\nend tell\"\n            exit repeat\n        on error errorMessage\n            if ((current date) > endDate) then\n                error \"Can not \" & uiScript\n            end if\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend doWithTimeout\n\nand vice versa:\n-- Click the “Notification Center” menu bar item.\ndelay 2.508349\nset timeoutSeconds to 2.0\nset uiScript to \"click menu bar item \\\"Notification Center, Do Not Disturb enabled\\\" of menu bar 1 of application process \\\"SystemUIServer\\\"\"\nmy doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)\n\n-- Click the “<fill in title>” button.\ndelay 1.176098\nset timeoutSeconds to 2.0\nset uiScript to \"click UI Element 3 of group \\\"Do Not Disturb\\\" of scroll area 1 of window \\\"Notification Center\\\" of application process \\\"Notification Center\\\"\"\nmy doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)\n\non doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)\n    set endDate to (current date) + timeoutSeconds\n    repeat\n        try\n            run script \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\"\n\" & uiScript & \"\nend tell\"\n            exit repeat\n        on error errorMessage\n            if ((current date) > endDate) then\n                error \"Can not \" & uiScript\n            end if\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend doWithTimeout\n\nIt would be better if there were a solution that checked its state or explicitly specified the desired new state instead of just toggling.

I've also tried clicking the element named Announce the time:, but that didn't work either.\nHow can I toggle the Announce the time: checkbox?\n\nA: Using Accessibility Inspector, a part of Xcode, it shows that some of the time the Announce the time: checkbox reports \"Parent does not report element as one of its children\" and as such will cause AppleScript code to fail under certain conditions, and under other conditions not fail. In other words, writing my own code I can get it to check that checkbox sometimes and not other times.\nIn trying to ascertain a pattern to see how to workaround this situation I came to the conclusion that using fully visible UI Scripting was the most reliable way. It's also unfortunately an ugly way and requires letting the script finish without interruption once started, otherwise it will fail for sure. Such are the pitfalls of fully visible UI Scripting.\nThe example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested in Script Editor under macOS Big Sur with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate setting in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nThis script requires that the Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls checkbox is checked on the System Preferences >  Keyboard > Shortcuts tab, and as coded, the script checks its status and toggles the checkbox, as necessary, based on its current status.\n\nExample AppleScript code:\n--  # Check to see if System Preferences is \n--  # running and if yes, then close it.\n--  # \n--  # This is done so the script will not fail \n--  # if it is running and a modal sheet is \n--  # showing, hence the use of 'killall' \n--  # as 'quit' fails when done so, if it is.\n--  #\n--  # This is also done to allow default behaviors\n--  # to be predictable from a clean occurrence.\n\nif running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n    try\n        tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n    on error\n        do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\"\n    end try\n    delay 0.1\nend if\n\n--  # Make sure System Preferences is not running before\n--  # opening it again.

This results in significant performance improvements to launch time.\n\nbut they store most of the macOS libraries.\nLet me expand on this: the contents of /var/db/dyld/ (Catalina and earlier macOS versions) and /System/Library/dyld/ (Big Sur and later) are essentially the same. They both store pairs of files: a text map file (with a .map extension) and a binary shared cache file (without extension), for example:\ndyld_shared_cache_x86_64h.map\ndyld_shared_cache_x86_64h\n\nThe text map file contains information about the shared cache file, and looks like this:\nmapping  EX 1331MB 0x7FFF20000000 -> 0x7FFF73398000\nmapping  RW  224MB 0x7FFF80000000 -> 0x7FFF8E0C6000\nmapping  RO  432MB 0x7FFFC0000000 -> 0x7FFFDB0E0000\n\n\n/Library/Apple/System/Library/Accounts/Notification/CloudBookmarksAccountsNotifier.bundle/Contents/MacOS/CloudBookmarksAccountsNotifier\n                  __TEXT 0x7FFF20040000 -> 0x7FFF20042000\n                  __DATA 0x7FFF81B6B108 -> 0x7FFF81B6B8F0\n              __LINKEDIT 0x7FFFC05C0000 -> 0x7FFFD8A4A538\n\n/System/Library/AccessibilityBundles/AXSpeechImplementation.bundle/Versions/A/AXSpeechImplementation\n                  __TEXT 0x7FFF20042000 -> 0x7FFF20048000\n                  __DATA 0x7FFF81B6B8F0 -> 0x7FFF81B6CF70\n              __LINKEDIT 0x7FFFC05C0000 -> 0x7FFFD8A4A538\n\n/System/Library/Accounts/Access/CloudKitAccessPlugin.bundle/Contents/MacOS/CloudKitAccessPlugin\n                  __TEXT 0x7FFF20048000 -> 0x7FFF2004C000\n                  __DATA 0x7FFF81B6CF70 -> 0x7FFF81B6D840\n              __LINKEDIT 0x7FFFC05C0000 -> 0x7FFFD8A4A538\n(...)\n\nThe format of the map file (which is unchanged in Big Sur) is pretty straighforward:\n\n*\n\n*It contains a 3-line header\n\n*It contains several hundreds of entries, one for every file included in the shared cache file, that specify where relevant sections of the specified shared library can be found in the shared cache file\n\nPrior to Big Sur, all shared libraries listed in the map file (that's 1809 in Catalina) were also located in the file system.\nIn Big Sur and later, most are not. In fact, in Big Sur 11.2.3, only 12 out of 1956 of the listed libraries can be found in the file system:\n(for file in $(grep / /System/Library/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_x86_64.map); do ls $file; done) 2>&1 | grep \"No such file or directory\" | wc -l\n1944\ngrep / /System/Library/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_x86_64.map | wc -l\n1956\n\nThat's most probably the reason why the cache files were moved from /var/db/dyld to a SIP-protected folder, namely /System: to make it clear that you shouldn't mess around with them.\nIf you delete the shared cache files in /System/Library/dyld/, I'm afraid your system won't be able to boot or run.\nFurther reading\nHow to fix an extracted dyld from dyld_shared_cache_x86_64?

How can I enable the star rating display (as Windows Explorer does for instance)?\n\nA: Capture One [& many other photo apps] usually store that data in a sidecar XMP file along with RAW edits etc, not in the photo itself. Usually, only another similar app will be able to read them, by associating the sidecars with the originals.\nI don't ever edit in Capture One, I only ever use it as a tethering solution then hand off to ViewNX, so I've not tested which other apps can read those particular XMP files.\nFor comparison, I've never found anything which can read the star ratings from Nikon's ViewNX-i other than other Nikon apps.\n", "Q: (iWork) Numbers: Cut and Paste, macros Is there a way to \"cut\" certain cells and paste them to another cells or sheet without losing formulas with references to other cells (such as MS Excel does with command+X).\nNumbers does not support Excel macros at all?\n\nA: One way to cut formula and paste in new location with references 'in tact and relative' is following:\n\n*\n\n*navigate to desired cell containing formula\n\n*⌥ + ⏎ ('enter cell edit mode', same as F2 in Windows Excel)\n\n*⌘ + A ('select all')\n\n*⌘ + X ('cut')\n\n*⏎ ('exit cell')\n\n*navigate to destination cell\n\n*= (opens popup window for entering formula)\n\n*⌘ + V ('paste')\n\nAlternatively one can make references in formula absolute with ⌘ + K and then cut-paste whole cell.\n", "Q: Slight blue shade on my MacBook Pro \nI am seeing a light blue shade on anything I open in my MacBook, it just started suddenly and I don’t have any idea why its happening.

They have auto-update set to ON. Does anyone know how I can resolve this?\n\nA: When you add an individual tester to a specific build, they're not automatically added to new builds you push to TestFlight. You need to do that manually - or add the user to a group.\nNote that even if the individual tester is added to a specific build, it doesn't mean that it is available to them yet.

If I select the unsorted mails in Mail.app's Inbox, then Mail > Message > Apply Rules, the unsorted messages immediately move to the correct specified mailbox. In all other respects, Mail.app runs correctly and quickly.\nMy setup uses Spam Sieve, but these Rules are below the Spam Sieve rule in Mail.app's Rules list, so SS has already done its exam and, I think, isn't involved in this oddity. The only Rule that runs an AppleScript is the Spam Sieve \"Remote Training\" Rule, which appears on the Rules list above the Spam Sieve Rule. The non-sort behavior also occurs if the machine (an iMac) is in Safe Mode.\nThe same issue has been asked about here and here. As suggested, I discarded all the rules, then quit Mail.app, restarted the Mac, and then recreated the rules from scratch. The same behavior continues.\nAny idea what's going on here, or how I might improve Mail.app's performance?\n\nA: The issue was mine.\nI deleted all the existing rules, and remade them from scratch. Some new rules didn't work well at first, but I modified the conditions (adding a condition with a problematic email selected creates a condition based on that email's attributes) and then used the \"Apply Rules\" selection from the \"Message\" menu to test their effect.\nAfter a few days of testing, sorting is now almost always correct, and immediate.\n", "Q: Copy file to protected directory using AppleScript \nI'm trying to simulate Finder's file copy, but to a protected directory, using AppleScript.

Not sure whether to ask this in the apple or law SE but it's very apple specific, so I'll ask here. I own a 2016 MacBook pro that I bought second-hand. Some of the keys get stuck, which was the reason Apple offers a complimentary repair service for affected models. I've known this for a while but I only now got around to taking my MB to a repair store. They informed me that the \"quality program\" as they call it is only valid for up to 4 years after purchase. Replacing the keyboard now would cost over $600. Are there any options to get apple to pay for the repair once the repair window has closed?\n\nA: No. Once the 4 year extended warranty program elapses the computer is no longer covered. This, of course, is problematic given that the issue recurs regardless of the age of the computer or previous repairs.\nSince current models do not suffer this issue, the only real solution is to get a new computer - or pay the repair price.\n", "Q: Record all macOS notifications I use Chrome and other softwares which display notifications, and sometimes I miss them. Most of the time, these notifications are not recorded in \"Notification Center\", nor can they be find in the software. How can I preserve a history of all notification that is shown?\n\nA: This is not the ideal answer, but it is a start.\nNotifications are transient and it is not intended that they are put into any history which is easy to use. But you can write software which can catch some aspects of notifications.\nNotification activity does get recorded in the system log. To get you started a command like this will show recent notifications (you may need to modify for High Sierra, I am using Big Sur):\nlog show --predicate '(subsystem == \"com.apple.unc\") && (category == \"application\")' --style syslog --info --last 1h\n\nYou could write an application which spawns a subprocess running that command, collecting the output, and storing essential activity.\nNote that though it records the application that sent the notification, it does not show the content of the notification.\n", "Q: inifinitely regressing \"ls\" drive under \"Volumes\" First of all, I am aware the \"ls\" command means list all items in a directory.\nYesterday an icon appeared on my desktop with a picture of a drive labeled \"ls\".

He's been editing a film and over time the RAID device has filled completely up. I'm not sure exactly how much total storage it offers, but it's around 10TB and there is only about 280GB of free space left. That's about 97-98% full. I remember from college that having a spinning disk too full is BAD for performance but this is ridiculous. His MacBook seems fine until you plug in the RAID, at which point the entire OS crawls to a halt. The Lacie shows up for perhaps a moment in the finder (and Disk Utility) but then the entire thing grinds to a halt. His MacBook crashes constantly. I think we need to free up some space on that drive or he stands to lose a lot of work and possibly some footage as well. If we can just get access to the drive and stop all the unnecessary disk traffic to it, we might have a chance.\nIt seems clear that the GUI elements (About this Mac, Disk Utility, Finder) really bog things down. My guess is that these make numerous informational and file listing requests on a polling basis as soon as you open the window, which causes the already-distressed drive even more stress. I suspect (but this is just speculation) that there might be some kind of routine defragmenting going on or something.\nI was imagining that using Terminal commands to inspect the drive's information and contents might help stop a lot of the disk traffic. I was considering starting the machine in single user mode or something.\nCan anyone suggest a course of action where I can connect to the drive via terminal and NO OTHER PROCESSES interact with the drive? Can we stop all indexing on this drive or any byte shuffling that might be doing defragmenting and that sort of thing?\nEDIT: it seems clear that we need to stop Spotlight from indexing this RAID array. Unfortunately, we've tried opening the System Preferences->Spotlight->Privacy and then clicking '+' and dragging the drive into the privacy list, but the system is so busy that it refuses to make the change. We need to be able to prevent indexing of the drive before it gets plugged in somehow.\nEDIT 2: per jksoegaard's suggestion, here is the dmesg output. It was tricky to obtain this information -- the machine is quite unstable from the moment you plug the drive in. This was the dmesg output just after the Storage icon disappeared from the finder and just before the machine crashed.\nEDIT 3: Also per jksoegaard's suggestion, we have booted the machine in recovery mode with the drive connected.\nThe drive is much better behaved in recovery mode than it is when the Mac is booted normally. It is noteworthy that all of the drives appear in the disk utility and each has S.M.A.R.T.=verified and each drive appears to be in good health. We can also use the terminal to list the drive's contents and even remove files.\nIt does look like some piece of software must be slamming this drive when the mac boots normally. Any hints on how to identify this process would be much appreciated.\nAlso, I'm not at all certain, but it looks like whoever set it up didn't follow the Lacie installation instructions, instead choosing to set it up as Apple Raid?  I don't know this for certain, but expect it might be disastrous to install the Lacie drivers & software if they were not used originally. Plz see attached images:\nLooks like apple raid!\n\nEach drive is listed individually.\n\nEDIT 4:\nWe have been trying to work with the drive attached to the mac booted in recovery mode, and the drive is still being SUPER flaky, but you can actually work with it a bit. For example, we were able to copy a folder to another USB drive reasonably well. We then tried to delete that folder on the RAID drive using rm -r /Volumes/Storage/music/dir then we got some weird prompts like\nrm /Volumes/Storage/music/dir/file.mp4a: No such file or directory\noverride rw-r--r-- _unknown/_unknown for /Volumes/Storage/music/dir/file.mp4a?\n\nAnswering yes to all those seems to satisfy the drive, but then when the rm completes, the flakiness comes raging back and when we try to ls -l /Volumes/Storage we get:\nls: /Volumes/Storage: No such file or directory\n\nContinued attempts to copy or delete files from the drive eventually crash the laptop, even though its' running in recovery mode.\n\nA: It is not so that having an external disk near filled up causes slowness of the system. That it not a rule. Having 280 GB free space on a 10 TB external RAID-array is perfectly fine, and does not in anyway in itself cause any slowness.\nOf course if you're regularly adding data to the drive, you would want to consider adding extra disk space, as you would eventually run out of free disk space to store new files.\nIt is also not the case that Disk Utility and Finder make numerous information and file listing requests on a polling basis. Opening Disk Utility will query the RAID for it's size and partitions once - that is a very basic request that should take a fraction of a second. Similarly opening Finder will list the files and folders in that particular folder once - not continually polling for a file list.\nIf you have other programs running that are actively saving, adding or removing files on the external drive, then that would cause Finder to update its information about those files.\nFurthermore it is not the case that \"routine defragmentation\" takes place when using Finder or Disk Utility.\nAs for you question on how to connect to the drive via Terminal without other processes bothering you - I would suggest booting the Mac in Recovery mode by holding down Cmd-R while booting the computer. From there you can open an undisturbed Terminal window.\nHowever, I would highlight the possibility of a controller or drive failure might be the cause of all your problems. I would immediately check the Console for signs of disk I/O errors. You can also run the command sudo dmesg from a Terminal to get more insight into current kernel error messages and warnings.\nAnother thing to look out for are programs that by design try to access all files on external disks. For example check whether you're running backup software (such as Backblaze or similar) or antivirus software that is set to backup/scan all files on external drives. You could temporarily pause/disable them to check whether or not they are causing problems.\n", "Q: Built-in MacBook screen recognized as a separate display I have a late 2011 Macbook Pro 13 inch.

I also cannot dim the screen using the buttons on the keyboard.\nAnother problem is that my internal speakers are not showing up in my sound preferences. I tried plugging in headphones in the headphone jack, but that didn't work either. When I boot up the computer, there is a chime that plays, so that is a good sign that the speakers work.\nIf there is anyone that can suggest any additional kext files I can download to make the display and audio work properly, that would be appreciated.\nThank you!\n\nA: Whalro! Unfortunately, I can’t supply any kexts. Most Macs made in 2011 or before aren’t fully compatible with the patcher. My 2011 iMac has all of the same issues. I still haven’t came across any fixes yet. By the way, have you tried using the patch updater? I hope I was helpful! Cheers!\n", "Q: What built-in utilities are available in macOS for managing/monitoring process/disk/memory/IO/file? I think Activity Monitor can be used for managing/monitoring processes, but I am confused about the other four: disk/memory/IO/file.\nAre all these four functions be managed/monitored out by Disk Utility?\n\nA: There are a lot of tools, both in the graphical interface and at the command line, for viewing and configuring these various parts of macOS' operations. I'll give you a summary of the most relevant ones.\nFor viewing processes in the GUI, Activity Monitor is the primary tool. It can also view other per-process things like memory usage, and disk and network activity (and it also gives some overall stats at the bottom of the window). You can also view open files and network ports for processes you own by selecting them, and clicking the Inspect (circle-with-an-\"i\"-in-it) button in the toolbar, then selecting the Open Files and Ports tab. And it can kill (force-exit) running programs.\nAt the command line, top is my favorite tool. I use top -u -s5 to show top CPU-using processes (updated every 5 seconds, because the default of 1 second is too fast). top -orsize will show top \"real memory\" usage instead. And it shows overall stats at the top of the screen. ps is the other main tool; by default, it only shows your command-line processes, so use ps -A (or -ax or -e) to show all processes. Check the man page for lots more options. You can use kill to kill processes by PID, or killall to kill them by name (/program). (Warning: on some other OSes, killall does different, and much more lethal, things, so think before you type.)\nA lot of the process management in macOS (especially running background processes) is handled by launchd, and you can query and manage it from the command line with launchctl (warning: this can be a bit confusing). Apple doesn't provide a GUI for interacting with this, but there is a third-party option: LaunchControl from soma-zone.\nFor memory: since that's pretty much used by processes, use the process monitoring tools to see what's going on. You can get some whole-system virtual memory stats from vm_stat (warning: these stats are in pages, not KB or MB or anything like that) or sysctl vm.swapusage (or if you want to drink from the firehose, sysctl -a vm). Memory management is thoroughly automated, so there aren't really any tools to configure it.\nFor disks: Disk Utility is the GUI tool of choice, both to see how things are formatted and to make changes (erase/format/partition/etc). Recent versions hide some of the complexity of what's going on, which I find just makes it more confusing; to show full info, choose \"Show All Disks\" from the View menu (or the View pop-up in the toolbar). At the command line, diskutil is its counterpart.\nFor files: if you just want to look around, it's Finder in the GUI. Apple makes a fair bit of the filesystem invisible in the Finder (which is sort of a \"don't mess with this unless you know what you're doing\" indication); if you want to see the normally-hidden parts, you can toggle show-all mode with Command-Shift-Period (this also works in standard open and save file dialogs). At the command line, it's ls (I use ls -AleO@ to show hidden files and various obscure attributes).\nIf you want to see what files (/folders) are taking up all your space, you can get a basic summary with Apple menu > About This Mac > Storage tab, and a little more info by clicking the Manage button there. There are a bunch of third-party utilities that give more detail. At the command line, it's df to show which volumes are getting full (df -h for human-readable sizes), and du to see how much space is used by each subfolder (and subsubfolder and...) (I mostly use sudo du -xhd1 /path/to/folder to give a human-readable listing that only goes one folder level deep). Note that you'll need to grant the Terminal Full Disk Access to let its commands see into \"private\" areas of the filesystem.\nFor file activity, in addition to Activity Monitor, you can use lsof to get a (huge) snapshot of which files are open (it las lots of flexible -- and confusing -- options), and fs_usage to get an (extremely detailed) running log of file accesses.\nFor I/O, it really depends on the type of I/O you're interested in. If you want to see what's connected, System Information (click the Apple menu, hold the Option key and choose System Information) will give you a huge amount of information about the system's configuration (and not just about I/O devices/attachments). system_profiler is its command-line counterpart.\nYou can use iostat to look at I/O throughput per device (mostly disk access).\nFor network I/O, use the per-process tools above (and sudo lsof -i to see open network ports). To view and change the network connection settings, use the System Preferences -> Network pane and its command-line counterpart networksetup. For detailed network status, use the Network Utility, netstat, and ifconfig.\nOther I/O... is rather scattered around. Several types, like Bluetooth, Displays, Sound, etc have panes in System Preferences. If you have a specific type you're interested in, you'd have to specify it.\n\nA: No, the Mach kernel carries out all the operations. The apps just look at counters and report what the kernel has done.\n", "Q: Boot Camp Error When booting to Windows on my MacBook Pro 15\" Late 2016 (A1707 EMC 3072) I receive this error intermittently. It happens on every reboot. Sometimes immediately. Sometimes after several minutes. It's a generic Windows error message prompt/alert.\n\nBoot Camp\nThe system has encountered an error. A restart is required to recover.\nDo you want to restart now?\nOK | Cancel\n\nAll drivers and utilities were installed in Windows using the files generated by Boot Camp Assistant -> Download Windows Support Software while booted in macOS on this exact same machine.\nRestarting does not resolve the issue. Windows 10 Pro (latest) is installed and Apple Software Update shows all Boot Camp and other Apple software is up to date.\nAny tips on troubleshooting this? This is my first time trying Windows in Boot Camp. Is this sort of issue not uncommon?\n\nA: Don't wipe the macOS partition from the drive. Don't try to make Windows 10 the only OS on the MacBook's disk\nI had installed Windows 10 on my MBP by wiping the disk completely and booting a Windows 10 USB installer then installing drivers/supporting files that had been pre-prepared from Boot Camp Assistant. My reasoning was that I did not care about macOS on the machine. I only wanted to run Windows 10.\nApparently, this results in a limited experience. I assumed installing the Boot Camp files in Windows 10 would provide optimal support. That was not the case for me.\n\n*\n\n*The touchbar was not working at all in Windows 10\n\n*I was encountering the error mentioned above in Windows 10\n\n*The Boot Camp support services (which handled right clicks, mouse driver behavior, and other niceties) took a while to load in Windows 10\n\nInstalling Windows 10 \"normally\" through Boot Camp in macOS provided a much better experience.\n\n*\n\n*The touchbar worked in Windows 10\n\n*The error above went away in Windows 10\n\n*Overall performance/behaviors seemed better in Windows 10\n\nI'm now losing ~50GB of space to a macOS partition I never intend to use, but the install process resulted in a much better experience, which seems worthwhile.\nIt seems that installing Windows 10 on a bare macOS drive and installing Boot Camp support files does not produce the exact same experience as installing Windows 10 via Boot Camp and preserving the original macOS install in tandem.\n", "Q: Renew apple developer membership after it expires I had an app on the appstore and a few days ago my membership expired. I want to renew it now, but when I click on the renew membership button, it takes me to the apple website with some sort of referral code on top.\nHow can I proceed to renew my membership?\n\n\n\nA: You need to just wait and try again in an hour or two. The Apple Store is down right now  pending the new products that can be pre-ordered later today (in about an hour).\n", "Q: Where does Apple Appstore commission for inApp purchases apply? I always knew that Apple has commission from paid apps, but I only just found out this applies to inapp purchases as well. Due to this, many apps raise the price of their inapp purchases on appstore so that they do not lose revenue when compared with other platforms where they sell these services. This obviously worries me as I do not want to spend more money than I have to and I want to know, when does the commission apply so I can try to avoid it as much as I can.\nExamples of this:\nYouTube premium - costs 13$/month on iPhone, but 10$/month everywhere else - 30% extra\nTwitch Subs - cost 6$/month on iPhone, 5$/month everywhere else - 20% extra\nSpotify premium - costs 7.3€/month on iPhone, but 6€/month everywhere else - over 21% extra\n\nI do not know any other examples than this, but I am sure there are many, because not everyone is willing to take a 30% revenue cut.\nMy questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Does this apply on shopping apps like Aliexpress, eBay, Wish or not?\n\n*Where else does this apply?\n\n*What should I avoid paying for through an iOS app and rather pay for through my PC?\nI mean I pay monthly for many things. If I slapped an extra 20% on only half of them, I would be paying quite a bit extra! Say you pay for YouTube premium, 2 Twitch Subs and a Spotify Premium, which would total to 20$ and 6€ (about 27.5$ total) per month, but through iPhone it would cost me 25$ and 7.3€ (about 34$) per month, which is almost 7 dollars per month, I mean thats almost enough for another membership somewhere.\n\nA: Yes, Apple takes a cut of the price both purchasing an app itself - and for in-app purchases. If they didn't do this, I imagine all apps would be free, requiring an in-app purchases - effectively circumventing the whole system.\nThis is similar to how it works on Android phones, where Google Play Store takes a similar cut of both the initial app price and additional in-app purchases.\nOn both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, the standard cut is 30% of the initial app price as well as for in-app purchases. However for subscription based in-app purchases, the cut is reduced to 15% after one year.\nIf the seller is a small business the fee is reduced to 15%. On the Apple Store that applies for companies selling less than $1 million worth of product on the App Store in a year. On the Google Play Store that applies for the first $1 million worth of product sold in a year.\nYour question is then about shopping apps. The fees above apply to everything sold through in-app purchases. Items that you purchase by other means are not affected.\nThis means that for example physical goods and services, and person-to-person services (for example online fitness training, online tutoring services, medical consultations, etc.) are sold by other means, thus you're not paying Apple or Google anything in that case.\nFor some types of apps with digital content, Apple allows app sellers to let users access content they have purchased outside the app - for example from a PC. This is typically the so called \"reader apps\" (tv/movie streaming, magazines, newspapers, e-books, music streaming, etc).\nRemember that when you purchase subscription from a vendor web site instead of through the App Store, you'll have the terms and conditions given by that web site. They might be worse than what you'll get from the App Store.\n", "Q: Draggable icon in the title bar? Previously, one could see an icon of the document in the title bar of any open window. For instance, In Pages there would be a small Pages icon to the left of the title of the document. I used these to save the document to new locations when I didn't know the original, for instance, when I opend it from Mail.\nThis does not appear to exist in Big Sur. I am missing it. Is there a way to get it back?\n\nA: The draggable icon in the title bar is not gone in Big Sur, just hidden.\nTo display it, simply place the mouse over the document name for a second, and it will appear. Hold shift to remove the delay before the icon appears.\n\nWhen the icon is visible, you can drag it to another folder as you desire.\nNote that it is not necessary that the icon be visible if you just want to display the full path to the file.

I'd like to find this reason as well as a some kind of a solution for this problem.\nI'm using Dropbox 121.3.4266 on macOS Big Sur 11.2.3.\nUpdate: I've uninstalled Dropbox client, deleted the local Dropbox folder and have reinstalled Dropbox again. At the moment du -sh Dropbox returns just 6,3G, so the problem seems to be solved.\n\nA: Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud and other could sync programs often show different sizes on one file. You want to check a few files to look at the size on disk as well as the settings about saving space / dehydrating files / optimizing storage before trusting any one tool to measure on disk allocation.\nI use ncdu on Macs where I have homebrew running or du -s /path/to/folder to double check things. Finder and even Apple’s system information don’t always tell the true story with cloud files.\nYou can also get a good measure by using Time Machine to back up the folder and checking size there.\nAssuming you are actually that far off, the fix would be to boot to recovery and run disk utility one time on the drive to correct and detect any accounting errors, then potentially uninstalling the sync app to clean up the folder.\n", "Q: Can I detect the frame rate of a video using built in programs or tools?

For example: man ls or man grep. You can get comprehensive documentation on man by entering man man.\nSome of the basic keys used by the man command are the f key to page forward, the b key to page backward and the q key to quit.\nTry using the mouse to highlight the command, then right click on the highlighted text and select Open man page. See example below.\n\n\nNote: The highlighted text can not contain spaces.\n\nSome commands are builtin. This means the command is part on the current shell. If you are using the zsh shell (which is the macOS default shell), then you will need to enter man zshbuiltins for documentation.\n\nA: Also consider using apropos to \"search the whatis database for strings\" that can help find the right command.\nUse the -t option of man to \"format the manual  page\" in a manner that Preview.app can display:\nman -t apropos | open -f -a Preview.app\n\n\n\nA: An analogous action for obtaining a man-page, described in the answer by @David Anderson, above, can be performed with a shell function that leverages the special URL, x-man-page and the open command. This allows viewing man-pages in a Terminal session without taking over the Terminal window from which man was requested. Instead, a new window will be opened to display the man-page contents.\nWith bash, add this to your ~/.bashrc file; with zsh add the same to ~/.zshrc:\nfunction xmanpage ()\n{\n    if [ $#   -eq 1 ]; then\n        open x-man-page://$1;\n    elif [ $# -eq 2 ]; then\n        open x-man-page://$1/$2;\n    fi\n}\n\nIf only a name is passed to the function, the man-page for section-1 (user commands) is returned. To select man-pages from another section, specify the section number of the object, followed by the name in interest. For instance, to see the stat command information:\nxmanpage stat\n\nAnd to see the stat system call details from section-2 of the man-pages, do:\nxmanpage 2 stat\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to make a 2009 MacBook (A1342) boot from USB? I have a 2009 MacBook which I'm trying to factory reset/re-install. I have a USB bootdisk but sadly holding option to boot from USB doesn't work - I don't believe these models support it (A1342). It is definitely Intel (MacBook7,1, boot rom version MB71.0039.B0B). The Mac currently has Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.8) installed.\nIs there a way to load up and use the USB drive in an alternative manner? For instance from within singe user mode, or using a third party DVD bootdisk that will then, in effect, retro-fit the USB boot?\nOr alternatively, is it possible to partition the main drive to create a recovery drive in some way?\n\nA: Any Intel Mac should be able to boot from USB. So the possibilities are:\n\n*\n\n*that this particular Mac can't boot at all\n\n*that the USB disk is not configured correctly.\n\n*that the USB port is damaged.\n\nMake sure that the USB drive uses the GUID partition map (not Apple Partition Map, nor Master Boot Record).\nMake sure the OS on the boot disk is an OS that supports that hardware: - macOS 10.6.1 (Snow Leopard) to 10.13.6 (High Sierra).\n\nA: A search for A1342 by everyman.com results in the following Macs:\n\nYou have a conflict in your question.

There appears to be an update to MB71.0039.B0E for the MacBook (Mid 2010), which requires at least Mac OS X 10.7.2 to install. According to this Apple website, this update would give a MacBook (13-inch, Mid 2010) the ability to use Internet Recovery and thus an alternate method of reinstalling OS X/macOS.\n\nIt would be very remiss of me not to mention Tetsujin's answer to the question How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS?\n\nThere is also the Apple websites How to get old versions of macOS and How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\nRegardless of whether your Mac is a 2009 or 2010 year model, the maximum macOS that can be installed is High Sierra (macOS 10.13.6). The pre-installed OS X was Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.1 or OS X 10.6.3), so you would not be able to use an USB installer created from the original Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) DVD.\nUpdate:\nOne path could take which would not use any USB ports are as follows.

This step may not be necessary, since installing Sierra and/or High Sierra will also upgrade the firmware.\n\n*Again use this answer to upgrade to High Sierra.

I'm working a lot in PhpStorm and there use the keyboard-shortcuts for Forward and Backwards - which on windows are Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right Key.\nNow I read that this is on Mac Command + [ and Command + ]. Fine ... but since I use a German keyboard, ] is on Option + 6 and [ is on Option + 5. Pressing Command + Option + 6 does not navigate me Forward nor Backward.\nIs there a ment-to-be solution for this problem? Or am I supposted to actually reconfigure my keyboard to find something that actually works? There must be more people than me having this problem, so I'm curious, what solutions exist.\n\nA: I don't know for your exact situation, but very often this kind of command stays in the same physical location, even if the letters typed would be different - see Shortcut for toggling between different windows of same app? for a similar situation [that one, however, is compounded by the fact US keyboards are missing the key immediately right of the left shift key, to make it universally true].\nI'd definitely try Cmd + the two keys to the right of P, which is where the [ & ] keys are on an English layout.\nIf you are running Safari, you can check for this visually in the History menu.\nThis is on a UK English system…\n\n", "Q: Will disabling and deleting iCloud photos also delete iCloud shared albums? My photos were taking up too much iCloud storage space, so I decided to \"Disable and Delete\" my iCloud photos. However, I also have quite a number of iCloud Shared Albums that I've shared with other users. Will selecting the \"Disable and Delete\" option only delete my own photos uploaded on iCloud, or will it also delete all my iCloud Shared Albums that I have shared with users?\nI understand that iCloud Shared Albums don't count towards iCloud storage and iCloud Shared Albums is also activated under a different area in settings (Settings -> iCloud -> Turn on iCloud Photo Sharing). Is it right, then, to think that disabling and deleting iCloud photos (therefore clearing up my iCloud storage) will have no bearing on iCloud Shared Albums? Thank you!\n\nA: Shared photos don’t count against your storage, but they do depend on you having an iCloud primary library on one device.\nWe would need to know how you manage your photo library to give any more guidance. You could be iPhone only, iPad or Apple TV or Windows and Mac in the mix. Lots of variables and a call to Apple support is the best way for you to understand your exact setup if you have questions.\nIn a nutshell, you could delete all the photos from your online library to shrink it and leave just the shared photos to reduce your bill and toll on the free space Apple gives to each AppleID when they activate iCloud.\n", "Q: Higher RAM vs Higher Storage I am planning to buy the new MacbookAir with M1 chip.\nMy usage\n\n*\n\n*Basic Word, PowerPoint editing.

Immediately after rendering videos in .mp4 format they will be uploaded to Youtube and do not require save them MacBook Air storage.\n\nA: Opinion-based this may be… however, there's a slightly new paradigm with the M1 \"Hard disk\" storage configuration.\nIt is so fast that it makes additional RAM less useful than it was in the past. This is because it is now part of the same chip, rather than having to be accessed over a bus system to another component.\nReceived wisdom if you have to choose between the two is to go for more \"SSD\" storage rather than more RAM, as paging is now almost instantaneous.\nAnother consideration is that once chosen, it can never be changed, so don't come up short on storage, unless you want to be carrying round an external drive for the next few years.\nHaving said that, no-one can choose for you, you have to finally make your own call ;)\nI shall be using this same received wisdom in a week's time, when the Apple Store opens orders for me to buy a new iMac. Right now, I'm going to be going for 512GB or 1TB \"SSD\" & possibly only 8GB RAM, depending on pricing [which I cannot see just yet].\n", "Q: Is is possible to get audio notifications working for subfolders for Apple Mail on macos?

We've kept the video files on an external drive which is evidently dying -- like totally dying. Let's call this dying drive OldDrive. Fortunately we have a backup drive that has all the same files in exactly the same file structure -- it's an exact copy of the folders and files on the original drive. Let's call this NewDrive. Unfortunately, NewDrive is a different drive with a different manufacturer and different name in the finder. Since OldDrive is dying/dead, we cannot use any of the Final Cut Pro library functions to move the library from within. Is there any way in Final Cut Pro to just tell it to link all the video files on NewDrive instead? It would be a real chore to try and relink every file one by one.\n\nA: Reconnecting the original and even proxy media is very easy in Final Cut Pro.\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect your oldDrive\n\n*Connect your newDrive\n\n*Open the Final Cut Pro X library and open the media tab. All media which can't be found will look something like this:\n\n*In your top menu bar go to file, next reconnect media and then select original media.\n\n*Search for the files on the newDrive.\n\nThis Apple support article covers this also very well.\n", "Q: Can I run an 8k display on an M1 Mac, at 30hz? I want to buy an M1-based Mac. Tempted by the new 24-inch Imac but I suspect the answer will not change whether it's a Macbook Air, 13-nch Macbook Pro, or Mac Mini, as they all run the same SoC.\nCan I run an 8k display on it?\nI understand that a 6k monitor is supported at 60hz. Assuming we're talking 16x9 aspect ratio:\n(8 ^ 2) / (6 ^ 2) = 1.77777... # we must square because 4k, 8k etc refers to one dimension and there are two\n\n60hz / 1.77777 = 33.75hz\n\nIn other words, with the same pixel-rate as 6kx60hz, the display system should be able to do 8k by 30hz. Question is, is this supported?\nI'm very interested in buying the 8k LG Nano 55 and, since I'm mainly doing static graphics, the refresh rate is not too worrisome for me (I was an early adopter of 4k for the same reason and 30hz was not a dealbreaker).\nWill an M1 Mac support 30hz 8k over HDMI 2.1? Might it even support it at 60hz or something in between? I've known Mac tech specs in the past to be conservative. Actually if Apple is talking about 6k with its own 6016x3384 resolution \"6k\" monitor, as opposed to simply expanding Full HD by three as I did above, then the above calculation compared to the LG is 36.82 hz. Basically I'm guessing/hoping that 8k would be fine, but that since Apple doesn't do an 8k monitor, it's only providing a max resolution of 6k because that's the top product it sells. But I'd love to get confirmation from someone who might have tested this in reality.\n\nA: You are right to be cautious. The drivers are highly tuned for Apple official specs which allow for 6016 by 3384 pixels (20.4 million pixels) at 218 pixels per inch and 60 Hz. However, I’m seeing lots of references that the M1 mini implements DisplayPort 1.4 which has bandwidth for 8K at 60 Hz.\n\n*\n\n*https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/11/how-apple-silicon-on-a-m1-mac-changes-monitor-support-and-what-you-can-connect\nSince these are ThunderBolt 3 / USB 4 devices, you might get the display and count on a return policy if it doesn’t work well enough out of the gate. Apple also is updating the graphics drivers and Big Sur to work with these ultra wide and high pixel count monitors that are more and more common.\nI don’t recommend a TV for static graphics, but assume you’ve done that research and are ok loving with or disabling all that processing (motion smoothing, AI sharpening) that comes with choosing a TV over a monitor / display. What does the vendor say would be my final decision if you can’t find a retailer that will let you test things.\n", "Q: Big Sur SMB File Sharing won't work - \"There was a problem connecting to the server\" My goal is to share files on Machine A (my MacBook Pro running Big Sur version 11.2.3) with other Macs on my home network.  My understanding is that I must/should do this via SMB, but if it's possible/preferred to do using AFP or some other Finder-accessible approach (as opposed to command-line tools like scp), I'm open to suggestions.\nAt this point, I can't even access the files via SMB from Machine A itself.\nHere are the variations I've tried so far to set up sharing.\nUse the Sharing pane in System Preferences to:\n\n*\n\n*Simply turn File Sharing on with nothing listed under Shared Folders and no accounts checked under Options...->Windows File Sharing\n\n*Turn File Sharing on with a single folder owned by an admin account listed under Shared Folders (with 644 permissions selected) but no accounts checked for Windows File Sharing\n\n*Turn File Sharing on with nothing listed under Shared Folders and an admin account checked for Windows File Sharing\n\n*Turn File Sharing on with a single folder owned by an admin account listed under Shared Folders (with 644 permissions selected) and an admin account checked for Windows File Sharing\n\nHere's what I've tried so far on the client side:\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, use Cmd-K (Connect to Server) to connect to smb://[Machine] or smb://[Machine]/[ShareName] or [Machine], where [Machine] is 127.0.0.1, an IP address for Machine A, localhost, the name of Machine A, or the name of Machine A with \".local\" appended.\n\n*\n\n*I am never prompted to enter a password.\n\n*This results in an error dialog with the message \"There was a problem connecting to the server ... The server may not exist or it is unavailable at this time. Check the server name or IP address, check your network connection, and then try again.\"\n\n\n\n*In Terminal, run mount_smbfs //[Machine]/[ShareName]/ /Volumes/[NameOfEmptyFolder] or mount -t smbfs '//[Machine]/[ShareName]' /Volumes/[NameOfEmptyFolder].\n\n*\n\n*I am prompted to enter a password in each case.\n\n*This results in the error message mount_smbfs: server rejected the connection: Authentication error (and also mount: //Machine]/[ShareName] failed with 77 in the case of the mount -t command).\n\n\n\nI've even tried rebooting once and repeating all of the variations above, with the same results.  I've gotten file sharing to work on this computer in the past, but this is my first time in quite a few months I've needed to do that again.  Upgrading to Big Sur is the most obvious difference from before, but there are probably other differences I'm not thinking of.\nDoes anyone have suggestions for how I can get file sharing to work?\n\nA: This worked for me connecting MacOS Monterey and Big Sur to an SMB share on Ubuntu 20.04.  Note the cifs used as the URL scheme.\nmount -t smbfs cifs://user:password@server/share /mountpoint\n\n\nA: Filesharing, screensharing, printersharing.

The first time I inserted the card, it showed up and I deleted all the files on it. I went to plug it back in the dashcam and it still showed \"storage full\". I plugged it back into my Mac and it will not show up anymore. Not sure what's going on here.\n\nA: This may vary by dash cam.  With my dash cam, you must not delete files on the SD card using Finder or some other operating system utility.\nThe dash cam is intended to manage its own storage and, by itself, will remove old video when full keeping just the most recent.\nIf there is a need to reinitialise the SD card, this has to be done with the utility provided for the dash cam.\nIn your case, I think you have corrupted the storage and need to reinitialise the SD card in the way required by the dash cam.\n\nA: I think that with a normal erase using the delete button, the data doesn't actually erase the data, it just pretends that the data has been erased. This also enables you to undo the accidentally deleted files.\nI think you need to format your media in Disk Utility.\n", "Q: macos: change default \"zoom in\" for any application?

But you can help it with:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure \"Optimized battery charging\" is on.  System Preferences > Battery.\n\n*Avoid having power connected all the time, though this is mitigated by macOS and the setting optimise battery charging.\n\n*Avoid letting the battery go below 25%, but if needed sometimes don't worry.\n\n*If you are going to turn it off for many weeks, let it run down to 60% before turning it off.\n\n*Avoid high temperatures by keeping air flow around the MacBook - for example, don't rest it for long on soft bed covers.\n\nApple don't say, but battery is probably happiest between 40% and 80%.\nEdit:\nApple are very reticent about precise advice regarding battery health. The most recent Apple battery support note has no advice on maximising battery health - only about battery life (time usable on battery power).  The only reference to battery health is the tick box for \"Optimized battery charging\".\nHow to Prolong Lithium-based batteries is a relatively recent general discussion of strategies to assist battery health. In particular Figure 6 shows the effect on batteries due to to different use and charging strategies with maximum battery lifetime being from keeping the battery between 65% and 75% at all times.  Read this (and some of its links) with interest and to gain some understanding of battery performance - but not to hamper use of the new MacBook Air.\n\nA: Your new M1 Mac not only has sophisticated battery management software, but is also one of the most efficient laptops on the planet.\nYou don't need to do anything. Just use it as you need. There is very little you can do to improve (or worsen) the battery's life.\nOf course, keeping it plugged it will reduce the number of charging cycles, but in all likelihood, a 5-year-old battery will need servicing, regardless of whether it has 50 cycles or 1000.\n\nA: Gilby said it all, maybe except one more. If you live somewhere where temperature drops below 5 deg celsius make sure to keep your laptop warm when transporting it. Just one hour in temps around zero or below can easily kill your battery.

How can I prevent tooltips from appearing when I hover elements with the title attribute, in Safari 14 on macOS Big Sur?\n\nA: You can change the delay for all Safari tooltips by setting NSInitialToolTipDelay. If you set a really long time, it's like they're disabled. For example, 10 seconds:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari NSInitialToolTipDelay -int 10000\n\nDelete to use the default value\ndefaults delete com.apple.Safari NSInitialToolTipDelay\n\n\nSafari stores preferences in its sandbox container and defaults will only look in the container if you don't have a preferences file from a time when Safari wasn't sandboxed (e.g. if you've upgraded macOS and kept your home directory). Check you don't have a ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist file for defaults to use the one at ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist, or manually provide this domain to defaults:\ndefaults write ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari NSInitialToolTipDelay -int 10000\n\n", "Q: Battery discharge while Macbook was turned off in 1 week. Possible causes? I brought my MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon about 1 month ago, and I'm using it to work on pet projects occasionally, but not daily. I left it unused for one week and when I turned it on it wasn't starting, as the battery was drained (the screen indicator was showing).\nAFAIK laptops should not discharge entirely after a mere 1 week of no use. Charging it back went fine, the OS is reporting the battery health is good, coconutBattery was also showing that everything is ok, the battery has 3 cycles so far. I ran last shutdown in the terminal to double-check shutdowns and exclude the possibility that I put it to sleep instead. I also rand Apple Diagnostics and no problem was found, so I'd assume it's not the logic board or any other hardware. After charging I also did a quick test to see how much it discharges in about 2 hrs and then after 4 hrs, but it was still at 100%.\nI've stored the notebook in a drawer at room temperature (~22°C). So, if the diagnostics are real, I can't think of what could've drained my battery. Any ideas?\nEDIT: New idea that came to me: could it be that I closed the lid too fast after selecting shut down, consequently making it sleep instead or not turning off some hardware properly?\nEDIT #2: I ended up investigating logs with log show --style syslog. There are some SMC errors saying something like \"could not write SMC key\". I'm quite new to innards of MacBook, but this sounds to me like it couldn't shut down properly. That would also explain why there are syslog entries from hours after I've shut down the computer and also from the following day.\nEDIT #3: About 24hrs. since last recharge and I've switched it on/off several times, and also used it a bit (cumulated usage about 1h), and the battery just recently dropped to 99%. So I'd rule out battery defects and say it was probably a shutdown failure (maybe I closed the lid too fast or maybe some process was blocking the shutdown).\n\nA: These terminal commands will show sleep/wake activity since the MacBook was last powered up.\npmset -g log | grep -e \"Wake from\" -e \"DarkWake\" -e \"due to\"\npmset -g log | egrep \"\\b(Sleep|Wake*|DarkWake|Start)\\s{2,}\"\n\nThey both extract  data from the power management log and produce very similar output.  Try one or other (or both). The output includes the battery charge level.\nYou may be surprised at the number of times the MacBook at least partially/briefly wakes whilst you thought it was firmly asleep.\n", "Q: terminal opens with \".zprofile:6: no such file or directory: /opt/homebrew/bin/brew\" After downloading brew from this command\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nI am running these two commands\necho 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' >> /Users/alibaig/.zprofile\neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n\nI am getting this\nzsh: no such file or directory: /opt/homebrew/bin/brew\n\nOutput of cat ~/.zprofile\neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n\n\n\nA: Maybe you need to install Homebrew?

This answer involves merging while attempting to preserve the Projects volume in a separate partition.  Here, I assume there is no data to be saved on the Untitled volume. You can not directly merge the partition containing the Untitled volume into the partition containing the Macintosh HD volume, because the partition containing the Projects volume is between these two partitions. This answer will clone the Projects volume to the partition containing the Untitled volume, then merge the partition that contained the original Projects volume into the partition containing the Macintosh HD volume\n\nThe example used in this answer was taken from a virtual machine with Catalina installed on a much smaller internal drive. The drive was not encrypted.\n\nThe steps to clone and merge are given next.\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Disk Utility window and then press the ⌘+1 key combination to insure the proper sidebar is displayed, as shown below.\n\n\n\n*First, highlight the Untitled volume shown in the sidebar, then select the Restore button.

I quit and opened the Disk Utility to be sure I was seeing the correct results. There should now be one Projects volume, as shown below.\n\nYou are finished.\nInstructions When Projects Volume Is Formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\n\nSince your Projects Volume is APFS formatted, you can ignore the instructions below.\n\nBefore proceeding with the numbered steps given above, first execute the following instructions. Click on the Disk Utility window and then press the ⌘+2 key combination to insure the proper sidebar is displayed, as shown below.\n\nNote: Your container numbering may different.\n\n\nNext, highlight the container for the Untitled volume shown in the sidebar, then select the Erase button. For Format:, select the Mac OS Extended (Journaled), as shown below.\n\nFinally, select the Erase button in the popup window. When finished, select the Done button. I needed to quit and open the Disk Utility to see the results. The Untitled volume should no longer be in a container, as shown below.\n\nYou can now proceed with the numbered steps given above.\n\nA: Firstly, you don't need to have separate partitions. In what follows I assume you want all the files in all three existing partitions.\nI recommend having one partition which is formatted as an APFS container. The container can then have multiple volumes - in your case: Macintosh HD and Projects. The volumes will all share the 500GB disk, but will not be restricted to particular sizes like your 350GB, 75GB and 75GB.\nBefore you do anything with your disk structure make sure you have a good backup of everything you need to keep.  The backup of Macintosh HD is in case of mistakes/disasters.  You need a backup of Projects and Untitled because you will be deleting them.\nI apologise for lack of screenshots, but I don't have a free disk or two required to replicate your setup.\nThe steps are:\n\n*\n\n*Check you backups are good.\n\n*Copy the content of Projects and Untitled to another disk.\n\n*In  Disk Utility remove the Projects and Untitled partitions.\n\n*That will allow the main partition to grow to fill the disk. You should then have one partition of 500GB with a Container which has 2 obvious volumes - under Big Sur or Catalina they will be Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - Data.\n\n*Still in Disk Utility, select the Container and add extra volumes as required. Add Projects. The volumes all share the same 500Gb disk space and, by default, will expand as required - only limited by the total of 500GB.  If you want to limit the size of the Projects volume, you can do this when creating the volume by using \"Size Options\" - you may want to set the quota (maximum size).\n\n*Exit Disk Utility and, using Finder, copy your project data back into the new Projects volume. Copy the Untitled data into some folders in Macintosh HD - best in your home folder or the /Users/Shared folder.\n\nWarning: If you have a disaster (due to either your mistake or my incorrect instructions) you will need to do a reinstall of macOS and recover your data from backup!! So make sure your backups are good and you know how to recover.\nFinally, do consider if you really need multiple volumes. Everything (folders and files) is much simpler to manage if all your data is in the Macintosh HD volume.  If you don't have a strong reason for multiple volumes then just use one, placing folders under your home folder or /Users/Shared.\n\nA: Ok You have no chance, your 75 Go space on Volume Untitled can only be added to the Container disk2 (Volume Project) and i suppose it's not your choice.\nBut but but, there is a way to repair this :\nFirst you clone (with Carbon Copy Cloner free 1 mouth in test period) your Volume Project on Volume Untitled. Keep in mind in CCC to deactivate the SafetyNet option for the Target Volume.\nAfter this, you rename Volume disk2s1 as Untitled and Volume disk1s1 as Project.\nYou can umount the Volume disk2s1\ndiskutil umount disk2s1\n\nan after test if the new Volume Project is good and if ok, you give me the result of\ndiskutil list\n\nand i give you the commands to add the 75 Go space of Untitled at your Container system\n", "Q: Why does the 2021 Mac have a lower Ghz processor than the 2017? When I look at the 2017 specs it seems the 2017 provides\n3.4GHz\n3.4GHz quad‑core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz)\n3.5GHz\n3.5GHz quad‑core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 4.1GHz)\nConfigurable to 4.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz)\n3.8GHz\n3.8GHz quad‑core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz)\nConfigurable to 4.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz)\n\n\nWhere as the 2021 processor starts at only 3.1Ghz and goes up to the same processing of 3.8Ghz:\n3.1GHz\n3.1GHz 6‑core 10th-generation Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz\n\n\nA: I take it you are concerned that in some way a lower GHz indicates less powerful CPU.  But let's look in a little detail at the GHz values and the different 'generation' of CPU.  I will just consider the lowest specs, that is\n\n*\n\n*2017: 3.4GHz quad‑core Intel 7th-generation Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz)\n\n*2021: 3.1GHz 6‑core Intel 10th-generation Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz.\n\nFirstly there is 3-generations of Intel's Core processors between the two.  Without attempting to be specific, we can assume some improvement in efficiency for the same speed processor.\nFor mostly single-threaded applications (e.g. browser, word processor) the Turbo-boost value is important.  Here we see in increase in processor speed from 3.8 to 4.5 GHz.\nThe processor load will increase as more applications (and background tasks) are running and as the type of application moves to those being multi-threaded which can use many processor cores.  Such applications include photo and video processing.\nAt maximum load, all 4 cores (2017) or all 6 cores (2021) will become fully utilised.  When fully utilised the processor speed may reduce to 3.4 GHz (2017) and 3.1 GHz (2021). If we multiply cores by GHz (3.4x4 and 3.1x6) we can see that that the newer processor is capable of considerably more work - the lower speed is outweighed by the increase in core count.\nIn practice both CPUs will probably run a bit faster than 3.4 and 3.1 GHz when under full load unless the ambient temperature is high.\nIn summary we have three things making the newer CPU outperform the older one:\n\n*\n\n*Newer generation of processor;\n\n*Single threaded speed (maximum Turbo Boost);\n\n*Core count (even though base speed is lower).\n\nYou also might like to know that, as a power saving measure, both processors will reduce their speed when under a light load.\nAnd, of course, there are considerably higher performance CPUs available for both 2017 and 2021 iMacs if that is desired.\nFinally you might like to browse Geekbench results for the two processors:\n\n*\n\n*2017\n\n*2021\nThese show a modest improvement in single threaded performance and a greater improvement in multi threaded.\n", "Q: My iPhone cannot \"see\" all the books on my Mac via Mojave iTunes I have 18 books in Books.app on my Macbook Pro running Mojave.

I had previously not been able to find any explanation of what \"Move Books From iTunes\" was about or what it did.\nSo I reported that here as an \"Answer\". Except that it didn't last.\nNow, of 18 books in Books on my Mac, iTunes Devices > My iPhone > Books shows 8 of them. A few minutes ago it showed 5 and then I did the \"Move Books From iTunes\" routine again. It reported that it was moving 15 books. I don't know which ones are missing from the 15 because I now only show 6 of them after updating. 5 books, a different 5, then 8, now 6. And the current 6 does not include any of the ones I'm actually reading. I would quit trying if and when I finally got all 3 of those on the iPhone at the same time.\nI keep restarting iTunes, rebooting my iPhone, restarting Books on the Mac, running the \"Move Books From iTunes\" routine, in hopes that some combination will be the magic sequence of what is being updated in what order so that I can read those three books on my iPhone. Right now, it can't even \"see\" them to allow me to select them.\nUpdate: It appears that every time I run the Books \"utility\" File > Move books from iTunes, I toggle between two sets of books. One set has 6 books and the other 16, with a total of 18 different books. I have no clue what put which books in which list.\nUnfortunately, there are two books that I am in the middle of, one happens to be in each list, so I cannot switch between those books without connecting my iPhone to my Mac, using \"Move books from iTunes\" to get the other list active, and then syncing that list. My previous set of books disappears off my phone, replaced by the new set. Then I can read in the other book. I repeat that when I want to go back to the first book.

I know that one can encrypt a whole disk using File Vault when the disk is first used and loaded with user data.\nWondering whether encrypting at time of disk disposal would be equality effective?\n\nA: No, it won't be as effective. Encrypting before writing anything (/anything important) is the best (most secure) option, but if you miss the opportunity to do that there are still methods better than retroactive encryption.\n(Note: this is mostly inapplicable to the built-in SSD in newer Macs with the T2 chip or \"Apple Silicon\" CPUs, since they automatically encrypt the data volume, with an encryption key protected by the Secure Enclave. Turning on FileVault on these models doesn't encrypt the volume, since it already is encrypted -- it encrypts the encryption key. However, any data stored on other volumes or other SSDs is not protected by this, so the following discussion does apply.)\nWhen you retroactively encrypt a drive, what you're basically doing is overwriting the old (unencrypted) data with an encrypted version. Overwriting the whole disk with zeros or random data is better for several reasons:\n\n*\n\n*Encrypted data might be decryptable if the key/password leaks, is guessable, accidentally gets stored somewhere else, etc. Zeroes and random data cannot be decrypted because they don't contain any (relevant) information. Encrypting sounds like it's providing some extra level of protection, but this is illusory.\n\n*Depending on how the encrypt procedure works, it might not bother to encrypt \"unused\" portions of the disk -- but they might still contain leftover copies of old files (Ezekiel Elin mentioned this in a comment). I don't know exactly how macOS' current implementation works, but I know that overwriting the whole drive with zeroes/random data doesn't have this problem (well... with a caveat I'll get to).\n\n*macOS' volume encryption works at the volume level, and doesn't encrypt parts of the disk outside of your data volume. And there are a few types of info that may be stored outside of that.\n\nThere's also a problem that even overwriting with zeroes or random data doesn't solve: the SSD itself doesn't expose all of its storage space to the computer, so if you erase/overwrite \"everything\" from the computer... you haven't actually erased/overwritten everything. Reading the hidden residual data generally involves disassembling the SSD and bypassing its controller to read from the raw chips, so it's not something people are likely to do unless they think there's something of serious value on your SSD, so you probably don't have to worry about this. See my answer here and the links in it for the gory technical details. Long story short, overwriting the entire exposed space twice is generally -- but not necessarily -- enough to overwrite all the actual data.\nSo, in summary: if there's something of really high value on the drive, either don't ever write it unencrypted in the first place, or physically destroy the drive before disposing of it. For reasonable-level sensitive data (e.g. your banking info), overwrite twice with zeroes and/or random data before selling/donating/whatever.\n", "Q: Installing MacOS 11.3 creates a Relocated Items.nosync with changes to private/etc/group I just installed MacOS 11.3.

I noticed that Big Sur 12.3 update notes mention that Hibernation support has been added for M1 Macs. I have an intel MacBook Pro and have never noticed an option to Hibernate.\nIn contrast to Windows machines, In Intel Macs the only available options are are Sleep, Shutdown, and Restart.\n\nA: Except in the most general way it is better not to translate terms like 'hibernate' and 'shut down' from Windows to macOS. Macs does not 'hibernate' in the same way as older versions of Windows - it is better to think of macOS having stages of sleep.  The final stage can be considered as hibernation.\nShutdown, too, is different on Macs and Windows. When you shut down Windows 10, it writes its state to disk (i.e. hibernates) ready for a rapid startup. On the other hand, macOS does a full shutdown, closing all applications, stopping system processes and halting.\nHaving got that out of the way:\nOn a MacBook there are these stages of sleep:\n\n*\n\n*Sleep or memory sleep: This is what happens when you close the lid or let the computer idle for some time. Power to display, disk, and other systems is turned off;\n\n*Standby or Safe Sleep: Memory state is written to disk and after a certain period memory power is turned off (standard 3 hours);\n\n*Hibernation: All power is off, all state has been written to a disk image. You know this has happened if when you open the Mac you see the Mac icon, and then see a progress bar while it is loading state from disk.\n\nThus the macOS 'Sleep' action includes a hibernation phase as a final step.  Mostly macOS avoids the final hibernation stage to ensure rapid start when opening the lid.\nMy Intel MacBook never hibernates - it probably would if I left it for many days with the lid shut (but not turned off).\nThough I don't have an M1 MacBook, I suspect that allowing a hibernate state will not make a lot of difference in practice.\nAt this point the question is answered, but to continue a somewhat further:\nThe pmset command does have an option called hibernatemode which is just one parameter for controlling sleep. This can have 3 values (this is an extract from man pmset:\n\n*\n\n*hibernatemode = 0 by default on desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.\n\n\n*hibernatemode = 3 by default on portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from hibernate image.\n\n\n*hibernatemode = 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want \"hibernation\" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.\nFor MacBooks there are just the two values: 3 and 25.\nMy memory is that 25 was introduced about 15 years ago, but went out of favour for more recent Macs. It is strongly recommended not to use 25 as 1) it can cause issues when waking due to FileVault, and 2) makes for a slow restart.\nTo control the stages of sleep, it is best to leave hibernatemode as 3, and to modify other parameters of pmset. This is mostly to control the timing of sleep stages, but also whether the Mac wakes up for network activity whilst the lid is closed.\nI am going to firmly consider tuning of sleep parameters as outside the scope of the question.\nAs a final point, you can investigate what macOS is doing while sleeping with one of these two similar commands:\npmset -g log | grep -e \"Wake from\" -e \"DarkWake\" -e \"due to\"\npmset -g log | egrep \"\\b(Sleep|Wake*|DarkWake|Start)\\s{2,}\"\nYou may be surprised at how much activity is going on whilst asleep.\n\nA: Hibernation mode is activated when you fully close the laptop lid for a little bit. Hibernation mode is turned off when you open the lid.\nUsually its seamless enough that you don't notice its happening. It's not always that smooth on windows due to the larger number of drivers and compabtability issues that windows has to deal with.\n\nA: This behaviour is one of the options when you close the lid of your laptop. There are two modes:\nhibernatemode = 3 by default on portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk),\n         and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from\n         hibernate image.\n\nhibernatemode = 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the\n     disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want \"hibernation\" - slower\n     sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.\n\nPresumably, the latter optional mode is now available on M1 Macs. It has been on Intel Mac for many years. But it's not something you'd noticed in the GUI: it's a command line option for the pmset command.\n\nA: On Intel and M1 Mac, you can tell if it can hibernate ( within the clear Apple specification¹ ) with the command:\npmset -g cap | grep hibernate\n\nthis will answer you in most cases with:\n$ pmset -g cap | grep hibernate\n hibernatemode\n hibernatefile\n$\n\nwhich means this Mac can manage hibernate mode and use a file\nto store the state of MacOS: the hibernatefile which is by default: /var/vm/sleepimage.\n\n¹    see man pmset\n", "Q: How can I copy / select all source code in Safari I am able to view the source code of a page in Safari, but I'm unable to find how to \"select all\" in order to copy it.

However, the two thunderbolt ports on my Mac are so close together that I cannot use the power cable and the USB-to-thunderbolt adapter simultaneously.\nWhen I try to back-up my Mac with the external hard drive using Time Machine, it says that \"Time Machine can not back up because the computer is running on battery power.

One end should have a USB Type C plug. The plug on the other end depends on the drive you purchased. Below is an image of plug and port types.\n\nYou can distinguish USB Type A from USB 3.0 by color. If the port or plug is blue, then you have USB 3.0. If the HDD's existing cable has a USB Type A plug, then the new cable needs to be rated for a transfer speed of at least 480 Mb/s. Otherwise, the HDD's existing cable has a USB 3.0 plug. In this case, the new cable needs to be rated for a transfer speed of at least 5 Gb/s.\nSolution #2\nUse an adaptor cable instead of an adaptor. In this case, I would recommend a cable which is USB Type C male on one end and USB 3.0 female on the other end. This cable would be placed between the existing HDD cable and the Mac. This type of cable would be compatible regardless of whether the existing cable has a USB Type A or USB 3.0 plug.

This was needed because I change routers from time to time and this change gives a new IP Address to my server device.\n\nA: The solution was to add a short shell script in the Automator application to get the IP address based on the MAC address.\nip_address=$(arp -a | grep \"YOUR_MAC_ADDRESS\" | cut -d \"(\" -f2 | cut -d \")\" -f1)\n\nurl_beginning=\"afp://\"\n\nurl_end=\"/YOUR_USER_NAME\"\n\nurl=\"$url_beginning$ip_address$url_end\"\n\necho $url\n\nThe code above will get the IP address (example: 10.0.0.5) of the device with the YOUR_MAC_ADDRESS MAC Address (example: 0:10:75:57:13:22). Then it will concatenate the correct URL (example: afp://10.0.0.5/YOUR_USER_NAME) and connect it as shown in the image below.\n\n", "Q: MBP + external monitor : alternative to \"scaled\" display to have smaller apps? I am facing a lot of small annoyance with my external display (4k, 27\" benq, T3 connection) like :\nit wakes up with the wrong resolution, the mouse feels incredibly slow (it looks like the speed is also \"scaled\") and some application just struggle to display higher resolution (namely jetbrains products).\nSo, I moved back to the standard resolution… but everything is too big now. I've reduced the zoom in some apps, but the menus remain huge.\nSo, are there any solutions (apps or whatnot) to either fix the \"scaled\" display issues… or to keep the standard resolution, but having slightly smaller apps ?\nThanks a ton…\n\nA: You don't say exactly what resolutions you're using, but if you use the native 4K resolution without scaling, then that will display everything as small as possible.\nThe whole point of using a 'scaled' display is to keep the clarity of the high-pixel density, while enlarging the screen objects, such as buttons, text, etc.\n", "Q: Can I get AVX support on my new MacBook Air (M1 CPU)?

I personally use FastScripts and I am not associated with its developer, just a satisfied user of the product.\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*This second example AppleScript code includes some error handling, in that if the tmp file (value of the tmpFileName variable) is not created the script aborts without any message. This can be changed by converting the if not my writeToFile ... statement to a full if block and include an appropriate display alert, display dialog or display notification command, as wanted, followed by the return command.\n\n\n*The repeat loop as coded is written to wait up to 3 seconds for the HTML file to load and should be more than enough time. Adjust if necessary.\n\n\n*As coded, it assumes the clipboard contains just lines of text with one URL on each line.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: Shortcut to take screenshot and save to specific folder Is there any way I can get a specific keyboard shortcut to take a screenshot and save it to a particular folder ?\nThe use case is quite simple: I listen to radio frequently and take screenshots of the songs I like. The screenshots go to my Desktop though. I would like to use a different shortcut than cmd + Maj + 4 so that when triggered the screenshots default to another folder.\n\nA: With native macOS You can only change the default save location for all screenshots to one location. The screenshot commands can't be split to have some screenshot commands go to one location, whilst other commands go to another location.\nIf your Mac is running Mojave or later, you can easily change the default screenshot location in the Options menu in the Screenshot app.\nMore information about Screenshots and the Screenshot app can be found at this Apple Support document. It is possible to customize the default macOS Shortcuts to key sequences you want to use, but you can't associate individual keystrokes with different save locations.\n", "Q: Why the need to update MacOS for iOS 14.5 I just updated my iPhone to iOS 14.5...

I have an old application I've been using on Linux for a quite a while that I like very much, and I'd like to use it on macOS sometimes.\nIt's called hcm, and it lives at https://stromberg.dnsalias.org/~strombrg/hcm/\nIt's mostly about running commands on remote hosts (mostly X11 graphical applications, but some interactive shells), a little like putty, but with predefined hosts and commands.\nI mostly use it to start terminal emulators that'll do a script(1)-like tty log locally, while giving interactive access to a remote host over ssh.  Each new tab from a given terminal emulator gives a new tty logfile, and a new shell on the remote host again over ssh.\nIs there a macOS terminal emulator, preferably an opensource one, that will respect $SHELL on each invocation?  I gave iTerm2 and kitty a try, but they seem to ignore a test $SHELL.  Alacritty wouldn't even run, with or without a test $SHELL, saying \"Alacritty cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.\"\nSuggestions please?\nThanks!\n\nA: This answer is not using $SHELL, but achieves the same result and more easily.\niTerm2 profiles, as well as setting colour scheme, can use a specific shell for each profile.\nAs an example I have set the builtin Red Sands profile to bash and not the default login shell (zsh).\nIn the menu choose Profiles -> Open Profiles.\n\nAdd profiles or modify them with \"Edit Profiles...\". Here is Red Sands with a custom shell.\n\nNow return to the main iTerm2 window and, in the menu bar, choose Profiles -> Red Sands.  This opens a new tab running bash.\n\nTaking this a step further (you want to run ssh for remote access) you can run a command when starting the shell/tab. Here I have added an ssh command to my Red Sands profile.\n\nSo setup however many profiles you want for the different shells and actions you need.\nNote: My iTerm2 expertise is at the beginner level.

This uses the Net::Ping module to perform a simple\n        syn/ack check.\n\n        Use of this option is highly recommended when subnet ranges are\n        used.\n\n    --ping_timeout *number*\n        This sets the timeout used when the \"ping_test\" feature is enabled.\n\n        Due to the implementation of Net::Ping syn/ack checks, this timeout\n        applies once per destination port used. Also, if the number of hosts\n        to ping is greater than the number of filehandles available pings\n        will be batched, and the timeout will apply once per batch. You can\n        set 'ulimit -n' to improve this performance.\n\n        The value is in seconds. (default: 2)\n\n    --sock *sockfile*\n        Sets the Unix domain socket filename to be used for interprocess\n        communication.

Number is optional and will default to 1 if\n        omitted.\n\n        Currently only one level of debug is supported.

They (as of now) are not manipulable in GParted and I need to shrink the drive as I need to migrate data off a drive. This is all done on a Linux system as I no longer have the privilege of using a macOS system.\nMy first thought would be to convert it to HFS+, conversion clearly being possible due to the existence of Paragon's APFS to HFS+ Converter (which as of this writing is no longer available for download) and the fact that I don't think deduplication would have affected my files too much so space occupied shouldn't be too different.\nI was considering running Paragon's tool within Darling but running alpha-level software to manipulate my (sole) backup is not on the top of my list and as far as I know, the converter does not have a CLI-only interface.\nThat being said, is there a (better) way to convert an APFS drive to an HFS+ (non Journaled) partition on Linux?\n\nA: Paragon Software has a product called APFS for Linux. This would allow read/writing to APFS without have to convert to HFS+. Evidently, you have to build and install the driver. So this would in theory work with any current Linux distribution. The only drawback is the APFS container would have to be pre Big Sur. In other words, the APFS container would have to never had Big Sur installed. Currently, Paragon Software is working to overcome this limitation.\nUpdate: In a comment, the OP posted there exists a read-only FUSE driver (apfs-fuse) available that might be Big Sur compatible.\n", "Q: Does iTerm (or iTerm2) on Mac allow storing host connections with user/password ( for quick access to different hosts) Does iTerm (or iTerm2) for Mac allow storing and quickly-connecting to hosts?\n(for Windows, even PuTTY lets us save connections. not clear when it comes to Mac)\n\nA: Yes and no.\nThe usual way is to set an ssh entry as a profile in Iterm. Here is an example  for a local NAS.\n\nThe no is for the password - iTerm does not provide a way of associating the password with a login. But in practice this is not a problem as you should be using Public Key Authentication\nIf you are not using PKA then look at use of expect with ssh e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/4786000/151019\nNote saying \"even Putty does this\" is a very high bar, Putty is has a lot of functionality.\n\nA: iTerm2 has a Password Manager window, which uses the system's keychain to securely store passwords. In my case it pops up a fingerprint prompt when you open it.\nThe password manager is separate from the profile (where you store your SSH command), but in the profile, \"Session\" tab, you can choose \"Open password manager automatically\" so it pops up whenever you activate the profile.\n", "Q: finder search not showing thumbnails When I search filenames of images in Finder, using the box in the upper right corner, the result does not display the thumbnails, see attachment where I searched for 2015.\nOtherwise the thumbnails display normally.\nI have already deleted com.apple.finder.plist in Library/Preferences and relaunched Finder and in \"Show View Options\"  Cmd ⌘   J   the show icon preview box is ticked.

Hence, I want to keep the previous functionality to get suggestions when right-clicking on an underscored word but would really want to turn this popup function off.

I realize that iOSapps can run on m1 macs, however that requires downloading the app from the App Store. I did discover that iOS apps can be extracted as .ipa files on an intel Mac. When these files are moved to an m1 Mac they can execute ‘normally’. However before execution they query their environment and they know they are not on their original iDevice and they change their behavior.\nIs there a way to attach a debugger to this iOS process on the Mac to study what the iOS process is doing?\nOne way is to run an iOS app in a sandbox on the m1 Mac so it thinks it’s on the original iDevice. Then I could compare the sandboxed execution with the execution of the same app unsandboxed. But I need a way to ‘run an iPhone Os’ on a Mac. Can an iOS image be run as a virtual machine?\nPlease note that I do not have the source code of these apps so I cannot get the debug compilation from Xcode which can then run in corellium\n\nA: Yes, you can attach a debugger to such an \"iOS process\" just like you would attach debuggers to other processes. You'll probably want to disable SIP.\nThere's no sandbox that works like \"an original iDevice\" (whatever that might be).\nIn pure technical terms, you are actually running the iOS app in a virtual machine already (no, it doesn't have to be full machine emulation to be a virtual machine). However, for the intent of your question, no that is not something you can do.\nI suspect your actual problem is that you're trying to run an app that tries to detect jailbroken iPhones. The detection method is within the app, and so it is not the same from app to app. If you knew what detection method was being used, you could most probably circumvent that. An alternative is simply to remove the check from the app binary.\n", "Q: iCal invites sent to my Gmail address (which is also my Apple ID) get added to iCloud My Apple ID is my Gmail address. I also use Google Calendar as my main calendar. But, when someone sends me a calendar invite from their Apple Calendar app, I don't get an email in Gmail, and it there's no invite on my Google Calendar. Instead, it gets added to the built in iCloud Calendar that I never use. This causes me to miss events that I need to be added to.\nI tested this on my own, and \"invited\" another Gmail account I have from the Apple Calendar app - it sent an email invite to that Gmail, which I could open, click add to calendar, and have on that calendar. This is what I want to happen when someone else with an iPhone and iCloud Calendar invites my main Gmail to a meeting.\nThis never used to be an issue for me in the past when I didn't utilize an iPhone (but still had the same Apple ID), but now I am unable to receive any invite from an Apple user to that specific Gmail. It appears as though Apple recognizes the email address when someone tries to invite me, and instead of sending the invite to the email, just adds it to the iCloud calendar.\nIs there a way to turn off this iCloud calendar from accepting invites, so that these invites can be sent to my Gmail as a normal email invite?\nUnfortunately, switching to using the iCloud calendar is not an option. I know I can subscribe to my Google Calendar in the Apple Calendar app, and to my iCloud Calendar on Google Calendar, but I need these events to actually populate on my Google Calendar itself, not just subscribe so that I can \"see them all in once place\".\nThank you!\n\nA: If your Apple ID is a Gmail email address, and someone sends you an invitation from an Apple device, your Gmail account won't get the invitation, but it will be added automatically to your iCloud calendar.\nWhy? Because your Gmail email address is recognized as an Apple ID, and that takes precedence: the invitation is added to your iCloud calendar instead of being delivered per email.\nThat's the default behavior, but fortunately, it can be changed to behave the way you want, as explained in this thread on Apple Communities:\n\n*\n\n*Log in to https://www.icloud.com with your Apple ID.\n\n\n*Open Calendar:\n\n\n\n*Select Preferences from the gear icon:\n\n\n\n*Select the Advanced tab and, under Invitations, check \"Receive event invitations as: Email to <your Gmail address>\":\n\n\n\n*Save the settings.\nNow you should receive invites per email instead of being automatically added to your iCloud calendar.\n", "Q: WiFi connection on my iPad automatically gets disconnected when the screen goes off When screen goes off on my iPad, the WiFi gets disconnected automatically.

This happens with any file I try to delete, and I have full permissions on the files I'm deleting.  When I enter the password, the file is moved to the trash (and not immediately deleted) as normal.\nThis is on Mojave 10.14.6, and it started happening after I installed security update 2021-003 (though I don't remember if it started happening immediately after that).\nNote that I can move files to the trash from a command line.  mv blah.txt ~\\.Trash works just fine (no sudo needed).

It detected the Beryllium virus on my bootcamp partition. Resolving the problem through Avast is not successful. I then booted up Windows 10 and run a full scan (full and offline modes) using both Avast and Microsoft Defender, however Beryllium was not detected. I then went back to MacOS and did a full scan with Avast and still detected Beryllium. What should I do moving forward?\n\n\nA: The pagefile.sys file is used by Windows as virtual memory. Basically, Avast running under macOS is giving you a false positive and thus can be ignored. I tested this by performing a clean install of Windows 10 (20H2) in a VMware Fusion Player (12.1.1) virtual machine. Next, I installed Avast and found no malware. However, I wanted Avast to scan pagefile.sys for viruses. Below is the procedure I used.\n\n*\n\n*I restarting Windows to boot to the Windows Recovery Environment. Basically, I held down the shift key while restarting Windows.\n\n\n*I navigated to a Windows Command Prompt window.\n\n\n*I entered the following commands. Basically, I wanted a copy of pagefile.sys.\nc:\nattrib -h -s pagefile.sys\ncopy pagefile.sys pagefile.bin\nattrib +h +s pagefile.sys\nexit\n\n\n\n*I booted back to Windows.\n\n\n*Using the File Explorer, I selected to run a scan on pagefile.bin, as shown below. For a better view, click on the image or open the image in a new window.\n\nThe result is shown below.\n\nSo Avast under Windows is ignoring the pagefile.sys file, but does not under macOS. Being this test was made from a clean install of Windows, I assume this found malware threat is a false positive and can therefore be ignored.\n\nA: Kaspersky Threats says that the Beryllium virus is harmless, so you mightn't need to worry about it. I have zero knowledge of computer code, so if you still want it gone, I have no idea how.\n", "Q: Send push notification to iOS without a native app?

I have some apps that I bought personally that I would like to use on my work laptop.\nCan I sign in with my Apple ID and then install these app versions there and then sign out?\nI guess I would not receive any updates for them that way?\n\nA: You would need to give your Apple ID password in order to update them.\nYou are allowed to install apps on 5 Macs.

I have taken the data for the current value of the cryptocurrency using stock quote so it updates every few minutes.

I’m not sure how to make the x axis correspond to a date and how to link this with the profit, I don’t really want it to update every few minutes as the figures do but possibly once daily. Can anyone help please? \n\nA: To create a graph of profit over time, you need data over time. Spreadsheets can only plot graphs of data present in a table, or interpolated between. That means you need a table containing rows for each time point you want plotted, not just the current value.\nNumbers can import ‘delimited or fixed-width text files’. If you can find a source for the data you need over time, you can import this into Numbers and plot the data over time.\nCreate one row for each point in time over a contiguous time period with regular interval and use a line graph, or plot using a scatter graph for non-contiguous/non-regular time (other types cannot be used, see Time as x-axis in chart with Apple Numbers).\n", "Q: What happens if you are being tracked using an AirTag but you don't own an apple device?

Could this be a software issue? This is my first post on this StackExchange community, so I apologize in advance if my post doesn't meet community standards.\nAn immediate family member recently started having a bizarre issue with her iPhone: its screen works, displaying the lock screen with no visible signs of damage after pressing the power button, but it doesn't respond to any screen input (touch, swipes, etc.). I've tried to force-restart the phone three times, but the screen is still unresponsive to input. I've also consulted this Apple discussions thread, but I'd like to rule out any software issues before seeking a repair with Apple.\nSome specific details about the iPhone and the issue at hand:\n\n*\n\n*The iPhone is a 64 GB iPhone 11 (not Pro).\n\n*The iPhone's iOS version (seemingly) can't be determined since I can't unlock the phone and hence access the Settings app or have it be detected by a computer.

Thank you for the help though everyone, I think I making a second partition for swap isn't needed for Ubuntu.\n\nA: From what you have presented in your question, you are finished using the Disk Utility. When you install Ubuntu, you can use the tools provided by the Ubuntu installer to finish partitioning the drive. You can used these tools to do the following.\n\n*\n\n*Delete the existing MS-DOS (FAT) formatted partition labeled UBUNTU.\n\n*Create a new partition for Ubuntu. You should give this the mount point /. If necessary, save some free space for the swap partition.\n\n*Create a new partition the desired size of the swap space. With the current releases of Ubuntu the creation of this partition is optional.\n\n\nNote: Ubuntu will use the hidden EFI partition created when OS X was installed. This EFI does not appear in the image you posted. However, this EFI partition will appear in the Ubuntu installer when you change the partitioning. You can use the OS X command diskutil list to see all partitions including the hidden ones.\n\n", "Q: Dock is stopping me from unmounting a hard drive I just upgraded to Catalina and am using an external drive as a system drive and need to unmount my internal drive, but I can't.

When I first saw this, I removed Apple Music from the Dock, but it still wants that tile and, rather than getting it from the external drive, that is the system drive, it's using the one on the old internal drive.\nI tried killall dock; sudo diskutil umount /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD and get the same message as above. (I hoped that it would unmount the drive while Dock was restarting and before it got a file lock.) I've considered just deleting that file, but I don't know what consequences that would create.\nI need to unmount that drive so I can reformat it.\nExtra (probably unnecessary) details:\nThis is part of an upgrade from Mojave to Catalina. I tried to start the update and it wouldn't, since my system drive was not in APFS. I had an extra drive, so I hooked it up via USB and formatted it in APFS, then used SuperDuper to copy my internal drive to the external. I upgraded the external to Catalina. My next step was going to be to reformat the internal in AFPS, then use SuperDuper again and copy everything on the external drive (Which is now a new Catalina update) to the internal drive. It appears EVERYTHING else is using the external for all system resources and the ONLY tile the Dock is not getting from the internal drive is this one iTunes tile.\nSo what is the best and safest way to deal with this to unmount the internal drive? I've considered using a forced unmount, but that doesn't always work and can cause problems. I don't want to just delete the tile file until I know what it'll do or if there are unexpected consequences.\n\nA: [This answer cropped up earlier in the week for a totally different question, but it seems appropriate again here…]\nI would be more inclined to prevent the volume from mounting in the first place, then it won't need to be ejected.\nYou can prevent it from mounting using fstab.\nI wrote an earlier answer on using this, so I'll link to that rather than covering the same ground again. The question itself is entirely unrelated, but the answer contains step by step for fstab\nTime Machine restore to new partition, different computer\n\nA: Can you try boot in Safe Mode (press Shift key when boot) and retry with the terminal :\nBelow adapt the name of internal Drive with diskutil listcommand, try :\ndiskutil umountdisk force diskX\n\nIf ok you can reformat this internal disk.\nKeep in mind that the system need an internal disk with a EFI partition (formatted GUID) because it's the only way for future Firmwares Updates.\n", "Q: Keyboard predictions when typing in Safari address bar (iPhone) When typing something into the search / address bar in Safari or Firefox, the predictions and autocorrect are disabled. This means I don't get suggestions to complete the current word I'm typing either.\nIs there a way to enable this functionality? It does seem to work in a lot of places e.g. iMessage, but also realised it doesn't work in the app store search bar.\nI've just moved over from Android, so apologies if this has an obvious answer.\nPhone is running iOS 14.4.2\n\nA: The QuickType predictions don’t show when the text field has autocomplete disabled.\nThis is most often seen in inputs where completions appear as part of the text entry in the app. For example, regular QuickType predictions don’t appear in the Safari address bar because Safari shows autocomplete suggestions from your selected search engine. This is the same for App Store search, Spotlight, and others.\n\nA: Though grg's answer says why this happens, it does not fix the problem.\nMy workaround has been switching to use SwiftKey instead of the default keyboard, this enables predictions seemingly everywhere.\n", "Q: Display virtual adapters in network settings I've configured a host only adapter in Parallels Desktop.

However, if I call recipients one at a time, their end rings and they pick up. It doesn’t matter who I call (my parents, sister, or in-laws) or if I call from my iPhone 12, my wife’s iPhone 12, or either of our iPads Pro. All of our devices run iOS 14.x (this has been happening since January and I haven’t noticed a change across updates). The receivers all use new iPads (we bought the family iPads in January to FaceTime with our daughter), but lack the skills (and we lack the patience) to help troubleshoot.\nIs there a fix for this?\n\nA: In the end, no matter how motivated you are to solve someone else’s problem, you can’t. Due to privacy designs, you do not get to know if someone else has blocked you or has do not disturb engaged or their device is just messed up.\nIn my experience, having a couple people one very slow rural cable Internet with buffering and lag means I have to call them one at a time (sometimes via landline) and have them start the “group call”.\n\n*\n\n*Have you tried having someone else initiate the group calls?\n\nAnd the next time I’m physically visiting anyone where the group call struggled, I might ask ‘How is your tech doing?” Only if they want help do we go intotheir iCloud and notification settings if they feel they are having problems. Most of the time they like it how it is and either intentionally or unintentionally don’t want all their devices ringing every time a group call starts. Only one time did my relative say “yeah, this is really bugging me let’s get to the bottom of it.”\nMy group FaceTime calls are super reliable with people interested in keeping their contact list clean and understand push notifications and have got their devices all set up to be notified by FaceTime when a call starts. If they want a group call, listen if they prefer zoom or let them drive the timing / orchestration of it would be my advice. Stick to 1-1 calls (or smaller groups) if those are the ones they tend to answer.\n\nA: AFAIK Group FaceTime calls don’t ring by design (unlike 1:1 FaceTime calls) - they instead send a notification.\nTo ring everyone on the call: swipe up to open the menu on the bottom and press “ring” next to each person’s name (simultaneously).\n", "Q: How to execute terminal command on energy efficient cores on M1 chip? I want to run nodejs process on E cores, but when I run it I see that it uses P cores even if there is a 0.3 second task.\n\nA: What you want to do is technically known as setting a \"CPU affinity\", i.e. letting the operating system scheduler know, which CPU core a process should be allowed to run on.\nAs far as I know, macOS does not come with a GUI or command line program for setting CPU affinity directly. This is unlike some other operating systems, such as for example Linux that features a simple taskset command for that purpose.\nHowever macOS does come with a command line tool for setting, amongst other things, the scheduling policies - amongst these the desired Quality of Service (QoS). This means that you can indicate that your prefer to run on the energy-efficient cores by starting your command line this:\ntaskpolicy -c background mycommand\n\nApple does provide an API for programmers that allow them to set CPU affinity directly.\nAs you indicate that you want to set the CPU affinity for various nodejs processes, it seems likely that you're developing software or running open-source software where you can modify the source code. In that case you can set the CPU affinity by way of the thread_policy_set() function.\nFor example if you have a Mach thread named thread that you want to schedule only on core #7, you can do it like this:\nthread_affinity_policy_data_t policy = { 7 };\nthread_policy_set(thread, THREAD_AFFINITY_POLICY, (thread_policy_t)&policy, 1);\n\n", "Q: Font book: duplicates are not actually duplicates I have a problem when installing new fonts on Font book.\nI'm want to use this font: https://github.com/sunaku/tamzen-font, following the doc I download the zip, extract it and drag & drop all of the content of the /ttf folder into the app Font Book.\nThe problem is that of all the different font sizes available in the /ttf folder, when I try to select on of the new font, apps (like iTerm) recognise only one: TamzenForPowerline\n\nIn Font book all the different variants of the font are marked as duplicated, even though they are not (as you can see from the image the fonts are different):\n\nNow, how can I tell Font book that those font are actually different?\n\nA: this is based on bitmap fonts (OTB) which in the past where optimised for a certain font size. This is not a font family. Therefore the Font ID - which is used by Fontbook to identify fonts - of each of them is the same.\nYou could use e.g. FontForge to change the ID, but for a variety of reasons I wouldn’t recommend that. Why not use a vectorbased, monospaced font? There are lots available for free including bitmap-like looking  ones e.g. here, here or here.\n", "Q: Chrome back/forward gestures reversed on Big Sur At first Chrome back/forward gestures stopped working after upgrading to MacOS Big Sur.

If I unselect that it fixes this problem, but then the vertical scrolling direction is reversed.\nAnyone else seeing this?\n\nA: That sounds like the right direction.

This tutorial was designed for Ubuntu, what would be the MacOS equivalent?\nIf it matters, I am on an Intel Big Sur machine.\n\nA: Linker scripts can be used with the GNU version of ld to customise how you want your program to be linked. Essentially not all customizations can be made with command line arguments, and instead you specify them in a linker script.\nThe ld command on macOS on the other hand allows you to specify all the possible customizations through the command line arguments. Therefore linker scripts are not used and not supported.\nIf you really want to find an \"equivalent\" option to -T, it would be @. You can go ld @file [...] and the contents of the file named file will be added to the command line arguments. It does not give you further possibilities for customisation than those already available as command line arguments.\nNote that linker scripts made for the GNU version of ld cannot be used with the standard macOS supplied version of ld.\n", "Q: Determine an SSIDs Index Value in the Preferred Networks List Im looking for a way to use the macOS networksetup command (and some string/line filtering mojo) to output all SSIDs from the Preferred Networks, and then determine what index my corp SSID is located at (and then take action depending on what index value it has).\nExample:\nadmin@mac1 ~ % networksetup -listpreferredwirelessnetworks en0\nPreferred networks on en0:\n    Denny's\n    Hipster Cafe\n    Hilton Hotels\n    My_Mom's_Basement\n    Airport\n    Marriot - Public-5G\n    HOME-OFFICE\n\nYou will see each line shows an SSID. 'Denny's' is at index 0 (top) and, therefore, is the prioritized SSID.\nLikewise, you will see my Corporate network ('HOME-OFFICE') is at the bottom (index 7 of 7).\nHow can I get the index value using a shell script? I have tried parsing the output and then building/filtering/appending a list using tools such as wc, grep, etc but haven't gotten the logic right thus far.\nI already have the logic to move my corporate SSID up to index 0, but I only want to run that logic if the SSID 'HOME-OFFICE' is NOT already at index 0 - which I can't seem to figure out.\n\nA: Formulating the problem in terms of “which index does my corporate network have?” makes the problem more complicated. Since you only want to know whether it's at the top of the list, just check whether the top of the list is your corporate network.\nZsh\nHere's a way to put the network names into an array in zsh. This uses three nested parameter expansion constructs around a command substitution:\n\n*\n\n*${(f)$(…)} splits the output of the command substitution into lines (f flag).\n\n*${(@)…##[[:space:]]##} strips off the prefix matching the pattern [[:space:]]##, meaning one or more whitespace characters. ([[:space:]]#, meaning zero or more whitespace characters, would be equivalent, since removing an empty string has no effect.) The goal is to strip the leading tab. ${(@)…#$'\\t'} would work too, but would be fragile in case a different version of macOS uses a different amount of spacing. The pattern needs setopt extended_glob, which is off by default. The @ flag ensures that the data is processed as a list of strings (list of lines from the previous step) and not as a single string.\n\n*\"${(@)…[2,-1]}\" selects the elements of the array from the second one (zsh arrays start at 1) to the last one (-1). This removes the “Preferred networks on …” line. The @ flag ensures that each line ends up in a separate array element. The double quotes ensure that spaces inside a network name do not cause each word of a name to end up in a separate array element.\n\nsetopt extended_glob\nnetworks=(\"${(@)${(@)${(f)$(networksetup -listpreferredwirelessnetworks en0)}##[[:space:]]##}[2,-1]}\")\n\nNow you can check whether the first element is what you want:\nif [[ $networks[1] != \"HOME-OFFICE\" ]]; then\n  …\nfi\n\nIf you do want the (1-based) index of a network name, you can use the i array subscript flag.\necho $networks[(i)\"HOME-OFFICE\"]\n\nSed\nYou can use sed to extract a specific line by number. Line numbers start at 1. Use the -n command line flag to suppress printing and the p command to print the desired line, or use the d command to delete all lines except the desired one. Use the s command to strip off leading whitespace; note that there is a literal tab character and a space inside the brackets.

My parents use windows and iPhone, and I have to run tech support for them.\nThe windows photo import tool fails, because the photo's arn't really on the device, and apple lies to windows saying that they are available for import, so it fails halfway.\nIf I install iCloud for windows, will it sync photos to the laptop via photostream? or will it continue to delete photos after 1000 photos?\nIf photostream isn't enabled, will it start randomly deleting photos older then 1000 days that my parents take, without them understanding what is happening? or will it give some sort of warning / clean up prompt?\nOr is this likely something they are already familiar with as (mildly tech illiterate) users.\n\nA: I have the exact same problem. Using on iOS over USB isn't recognized by Windows Photos, and doesn't show up in Explorer, even though the device is detected in iTunes.\nI use iMazing. It's a third-party software, but it can open iOS devices when connected with USB. iMazing also can open a backup of an iOS device that is made with iTunes.\niMazing can export photos as .heic, save bursts as multiple photos, and save videos of Live Photos along with the .heic.\nI've compared the quality and metadata of the downloaded files with the originals on the iPhone, downloads from iCloud web, and other general file transfer apps. I believe the iMazing versions to be the easiest and best.\n\nA: My issue ended up being driver related, what tipped me off was that the iPhone wasn't browseable in 'This PC' with DCIM available, so the photo app must have been using some alternate method of transferring the files.\nDownloading the official drivers to make the iPhone show up as a removeable storage media device, allowed Windows Photo's to transfer all of the files successfully.\nThe files didn't seem to be packaged with iTunes as explained in https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204095\nSo I ended up installing iTunes normally, checking for the drivers and not finding them, installing iTunes from the windows store, then following the instructions to update the driver in device manager.\n", "Q: How to setup Disk Quotas on macOS Big Sur?

But some forums on the internet say, I should not delete the private/var/folders. I am not sure what to do. I have no important data to lose. Now should i delete this folder? If yes what is the correct way to delete these huge files?\n\n\nA: You can do a Safe Boot (press the Shift Key when you boot) and verify if you get free space after doing a normal reboot.\nThe Safe boot clean system cache files.\n", "Q: T2 Mac with empty internal storage won't boot from install USB Every year or so I like to do a fresh install of Mac OS on my machines. The method I've always used is to download the OS from the App Store, create an installable USB with Terminal, boot into the USB, format the internal storage and then install.\nThis has not worked on my most recent Mac, which is a 2018 Intel Mac mini (the only one I have with a T2 chip). It first wouldn't let me boot into the USB due to a security restriction, so I rebooted into recovery mode and formatted the internal storage there. Before restarting I attempted to restart to the USB with Target Disk Mode, but it wouldn't pick up my USB within about a minute of waiting (maybe I should've waited longer) so I just restarted it normally and tried once again to boot to the USB on startup.\nEvery time I select the USB device on startup, it falls back to internet recovery mode. The yellow USB drive icon just instantly turns into the globe and prompts me to connect to WiFi. I've tried this method a few times but it sounds like any blip in the connection causes it to give up, and this has happened to me 4 times now. Is there any reason why a T2 Mac with no OS would not boot to a USB device? Is there anything else I can do besides retry internet recovery until it finally downloads everything in one go?\nThanks!\nUPDATE: I did eventually get Internet Recovery working. See my answer below\n\nA: Ahhh… Catch 22 mistake, I'm afraid.\nYou can't boot to USB with Secure Boot on & you can't toggle Secure Boot settings without an admin account, which was of course erased when you formatted.\nYou will need to use Internet Recovery to get back to a state you have an admin account, or take a trip to an Apple Store, with proof of purchase.\nSee Apple KB - About Startup Security Utility\n\nA: I did eventually get Internet Recovery working. I was getting various errors (-1008F, -2106F and perhaps others) after long periods of time spent waiting for the boot to complete. While some of these may have been down to a shoddy internet connection, it seemed as if it would just error immediately after the bar had reached 100%.\nAfter doing a bit of digging I removed the Mac from my iCloud account via appleid.apple.com as well as perform all steps on this guide to restore a Mac with Apple Configurator 2 (I found about that on this thread). You will need an additional Mac on hand to do the latter.\nAfter doing that, then booting with Internet Recovery and then reinstalling from the recovery menu I still needed to log in using my iCloud credentials as well as my old local account. Fortunately for me that wasn't a problem at all, but bare that in mind if anyone reading is in a similar situation!\n\nA: Do you have another Mac? You can still use Target Disk Mode on these Macs, without any security problems. So you may be able to install an OS or restore a backup that way.\nOnce you've got an OS on the disk, there may be an extra step to get the admin user recognised by the Recovery Partition, so you can alter the Secure Boot settings.\nSee my answer here:\n\"No administrator was found\" in Startup Security Utility\n(I have one of these Macs, and I disabled Secure Boot the minute I got it.)\n", "Q: Can't change APFS external drive icons Edit: The problem somehow resolved itself today. I'm not sure how, but I suspect it is because I restarted the computer. I don't believe granting Finder.app full disk access was needed, since I undid that yesterday.\nOriginal post:\nI can't change icons on APFS-formatted external drive volumes. I've tried many things as detailed below, but nothing is working for me as demonstrated by the screen recording below (click for higher quality):\n\nIn the screen recording you see that I'm able to change the icon on \"old Mac Pro\" which is an external volume formatted as Mac OS Extended Journal (using the usual procedure: pasting an image into the upper left of the Get Info). However, the same procedure does not work on the APFS formatted volume, regardless of whether I copy/paste or drag either .png or .icns formatted images.\nI've tried this on both a 2015 MacBook Pro and a 2020 M1 MacAir, both running Mac OS 11.3.\n===========================\nDetails of what I've tried:\nThis site says .icns files are required sometimes (since Catalina).\nThis site describes making .icns files using Preview (I found this works for icons when images are 512x512). This video shows making .icns files using a automator quick action found here. User BOrax on this site suggests a need to grant Finder.app full disk access, which I tried using System>Security>Privacy>Full Disk Access>\nhit + then navigating to /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app  -- again, nothing helps.\n\nA: In a similar issue I had an actual \".VolumeIcon.icns\" file on the system volume of a Catalina installation, instead of only on the data volume, just linked to from the system volume.  Only the generic icon showed on the Desktop, no matter what.\nRemoving this icon file and replacing it with a link to the data volume (as intended) solved the issue for me and I could subsequently paste an icon that did show on the Desktop again.\nAlso, when pasting a new icon, use the Data volume, not the icon on the Desktop.  If you cannot find it in Finder, use Disk Utility, select \"APFS - Data\" in the sidebar, right-click and choose \"Show in Finder\".\nYou could try this, before carrying on removing the icon file on the system volume.\nSince you are running Big Sur on the external drive, which seems to have an actual icon file in the system volume's root directory, I've tried an exercise and removed the link there on a Big Sur volume and again replaced it with the same link:\n.VolumeIcon.icns -> System/Volumes/Data/.VolumeIcon.icns\nSetting the external drive (in your case named \"APFS\") as startup disk in System Preferences, I rebooted into its Recovery, holding cmdR at reboot.\nThere - launching Terminal from the \"Utilities\" menu - I disabled authenticated root with...\ncsrutil authenticated-root disable\n\n(Note: csrutil disable was used earlier, but I don't think this should make a difference)\nWithout restart I checked the volumes and their mount path with...\nmount\n...which shows the system and data volumes of the drive in question (named \"APFS\" and \"APFS - Data\" respectively).  The system volume clearly shows \"read-only\":\n/dev/disk6s5 on /Volumes/APFS (apfs, sealed, local, read-only, journaled)\nSo I went ahead and mounted it writeable:\nmount -uw /Volumes/APFS\n\n...and checked that \"read-only\" had gone with another mount command, which showed:\n/dev/disk6s5 on /Volumes/APFS (apfs, sealed, local, journaled)\nGoing ahead, I removed the link (which would be a file in your case):\nrm /Volumes/APFS/.VolumeIcon.icns\n\n...changed to the root directory of the drive's system volume...\ncd /Volumes/APFS\n\n...and created the link again:\nln -s System/Volumes/Data/.VolumeIcon.icns .VolumeIcon.icns\n\nChecking again with...\nls -al\n...showed the correct link:\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel    36  3 May 14:10 .VolumeIcon.icns -> System/Volumes/Data/.VolumeIcon.icns\n\nNow I deviated from the instructions on this site and did not bless a new snapshot\nbless --folder /Volumes/APFS/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot\n\n...but just rebooted twice into the APFS volume, which I was allowed to do (maybe deleting the link and just recreating it was not considered change enough).\nPS.  The question is though, if this is worth doing for the sake of an icon on the Desktop.\n", "Q: Why do I have two 'Macintosh HD - Data' partitions?

Luckily, the center of objects is a natural \"snap to\" location for the magnet.\nOnce you have a magnet set in the center, you can easily terminate your lines at that magnet.\nTedious, yes.

Below is how it could be done in case you wish to do it no matter how:\n\nIn the example above, the data for both high and low blood pressures are shown in three separate columns, assuming there are three time zones in a day to be highlighted. I used the formula shown in the picture to separate the readings by time zone (you can do all of the separation manually if you like but doing it all manually might turn out to be extra tedious and it might be cumbersome to apply new time zone limits if you change your mind). Of course, the formula is slightly changed for each column so that it refers to the correct cells. In addition, the first non-zero reading in each second and third columns is overwritten manually with the number to its left to get continuity in chart lines (the second 73, 72, 143 and 142).\nI used the Format -> Style sidebar menu option to set the high and low lines with the same color after selecting the respective part of each line as shown in the picture below:\n\nI used a relatively old version of Numbers (6.1) to produce the table and the chart above but I reckon you would have no trouble producing them as well in case you have a newer version.\nHope these help!\n", "Q: Showing previously scanned page when scanning several pages The scanner window allows us to combine multiple pages in a single PDF document.

Let's say I want to automate the following tasks:\nSend the letter \"a\" twice every 2 minutes\nSend the letter \"b\" ever 30 minutes\nand send the letter \"C\" every 1 hour.\nIf I make a loop with delays in it, then I won't be able to repeatedly send \"a\" - I can only send it once in the first 2 minute cycle, not every time.  What can I do to put together all these commands?  Do I just have to make several running scripts?\n\nA: Not sure if you realize it but key stokes sent by System Events goes to the active front most window of the front most application and as such the target must remain front most and you basically cannot use the computer for anything else while the process is happening.\nThe example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested under macOS Catalina as an AppleScript stay open application, with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate setting in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nIn Script Editor, copy and paste the example AppleScript code into a new document and change \"TextEdit\" and \"Untitled\" to the appropriate values for the target application and window you want the key stokes to go to. The existing values were for testing purposes.\nWhen saving, on the Save As: sheet, change File Format: to [Application], and under Options: check the [√] Stay open after run handler checkbox.\n\nExample AppleScript code:\nproperty appName : \"TextEdit\"\nproperty winName : \"Untitled\"\n\nglobal theCounter\n\non run\n    set theCounter to 0\n    delay 60\nend run\n\non idle\n    my isItTimetoSendKeystroke()\n    return 60\nend idle\n\non isItTimetoSendKeystroke()\n    set theCounter to theCounter + 1\n    if (theCounter mod 2) = 0 then\n        my sendKeystroke(\"a\")\n        my sendKeystroke(\"a\")\n    end if\n    if (theCounter mod 30) = 0 then\n        my sendKeystroke(\"b\")\n    end if\n    if (theCounter mod 60) = 0 then\n        my sendKeystroke(\"C\")\n    end if\nend isItTimetoSendKeystroke\n\nto sendKeystroke(thisKey)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell application process appName\n            set frontmost to true\n            perform action \"AXRaise\" of window winName\n            keystroke thisKey\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend sendKeystroke\n\non quit\n    continue quit\nend quit\n\n\nNotes:\nIf you are just automating the typing of text into a text box or document, you can delete one of the my sendKeystroke(\"a\") and change the other to my sendKeystroke(\"aa\"), otherwise if simulating a key press for, say a game, then you would probably want it as it's currently coded.\nUI Scripting can be kludgy and prone to failure.\nSome applications will not respond to keystroke and or key code commands of System Events, as they are designed not to respond this type of event in this manner. Games are the typical type of application that may not respond.\nPersonally, I do not like this type of UI Scripting and have posted this more just as a proof of concept. It has been my experience that some AppleScript stay open applications can over time consume more memory and eventually crash. They can also cause the fans to spin up and maintain high RPMs. This probably has to do more so with some of the code being run, however, as a general rule I try to accomplish the task in a different way that does not become resource intensive, if possible.\nCredit to Tetsujin for his comment to the OP, which was the basis for this answer.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: Here's what I was able to come up with, but with a modified usage to send every 10 and 40 seconds:\nset countTime to 0\nset e to 0\n\n    repeat while e < 42069\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            keystroke \"a\"\n            keystroke return\n            if (countTime mod 40 = 0) then\n                 keystroke \"b\"\n            end if\n            \n        end tell\n        set countTime to countTime + 10\n        delay 10\n        set e to e + 1\n    end repeat\n\n", "Q: MacBook Optimized Battery Charging doesn't work I bought a M1 MacBook Pro 5 months ago and have been using it plugged in almost ever since, the battery is extremely rarely worked (probably once every few weeks). \"Optimised battery charging\" is turned on and working correctly for months, it would stop charging and be on this status \"Charging On Hold (Rarely Used On Battery)\".\nAbout 2 months ago, I had to take it somewhere for a day so I clicked the \"Charge to Full Now\" button, and optimised charging has stopped working ever since. The battery is always 100% charged, \"Optimised battery charging\" is still checked in System Preferences, macOS 11.3. How do I get it to work again?\nNote: \"Charge to Full Now\" may not be the cause, it's the most relevant thing I can think of that may have triggered the issue.\n\nA: Sometimes the \"smart\" algorithm fails to predict correctly.  For example, if you don't use it on a regular basis, then the algorithm doesn't know when you'll need the 100% next, so it keeps it at 100% until it figures out your pattern of behaviour.\nYou can try unplugging in on a regular basis for a while, to allow it to start predicting your behaviour.  However, I would recommend simply to read Can I tell my Mac to charge to 80% only? for other ways to get the battery to stop charging at 80%.\n", "Q: Activate FaceTime and Messages on Wi-Fi iPad with email address only? Is it possible to activate FaceTime and Messages on Wi-Fi iPad using Apple ID's email address only?\nSomeone has Wi-Fi Pad but doesn't have an iPhone. Although there is a phone number associated with the user's Apple ID, that phone number is not associated with FaceTime or Messages because it is not on an iPhone. When trying to activate FaceTime or Messages on the Wi-Fi iPad, the Apple ID email address is shown, but the Sign On option is greyed out and neither Facetime nor Messages can be activated with that email address only.\n\nA: it is possible. I'll try to walk you through the process in the best and clearest way possible.\n\n*\n\n*Create an iCloud account. (You can create this with an existing email address, just click the “use my current email” button)\n\n\n*Go to “Settings - Messages - Send and receive” than make sure the email you want to use is checked in both the “receive” and “start” sections. (I know we are setting this up in message settings, it will also apply to FaceTime)\n\n\n\n*Go to “Settings - FaceTime” and check the email in both the “Caller ID” and the “You can be reached at” sections. You may have to scroll down.\n\n\n\n*You're done! Open the FaceTime app and begin a call! Note that if you only have the wi-fi model, you will need to be in wi-fi.\nHope this helped!\n\nA: Yes you can\nI am using iPad (6th Generation) with only Wifi and I am able to use the FaceTime & Messages there without an iPhone. My registered number with apple account is being used via an Android phone and not an iPhone.\n\nA: It fixed itself after about 4 days. Without changing anything now I see the option to enter the account password and to sign into FaceTime and Messages using the existing email address of the Apple ID. Maybe it was a temporary glitch with the Apple servers or problem with the account.\n\nA: \n[...] the Apple ID email address is shown, but the Sign On option is greyed out and neither Facetime nor Messages can be activated with that email address only.\n\nI have experienced this described state too. A grayed out 'Sign in with Apple-ID'. The interface in this state is not very straightforward. I wish we had a picture or better gif of this state.\nThe 'greyed-out Sign On/In', as you described it, (confusingly) informs us that one cannot sign in, however, if you click on the e-mail address (and possibly hit enter), it will continue.\nSo the GUI / Interface is creating an incorrect expectation of what is going on and what you can do (and can't do).\n(I am not 100% sure if it matters, but I would start with iMessage settings page first.)\n", "Q: How does AirTag calculate the relative position from an iPhone? When looking for an AirTag, the iPhone shows the angle and distance to where the AirTag is located.\nThe distance can be calculated from the signal strength. But how do they find out the angle in which the tag is located?\nScreenshot taken from MKBHD's Youtube video\n\n\nA: It is possible to determine the angle because the AirTag has a carefully designed antenna emitting a signal in essentially all directions. When the signal arrives at the iPhone, which is responsible for the angle calculation, the pulse amplitude will vary according to the angle in which the signal arrives at the iPhone antennas. Carefully created software can then use the measured amplitude values to calculate the angle.\nNote that this is by no means a simple task, as it concern handling input at high speeds from two or more antennas and correlating information to determine when the same emitted signal is received by the antennas at different times. As far as I know, the AirTag also transmits at two different UWB frequencies at the same time - presumably to alleviate inaccuracies due to multi-pathing.\nNote that the software also has to keep track of the phone’s own movement under use. I.e. if you rotate the phone, the angle shown to the user should be compensated for that. This is quite simple, and it is not in any way necessary for the user to move the phone around in circles in order to do the localization.\nAs for distance measurements, that is actually not calculated based on the signal strength itself as you speculate, but rather it is done by measuring time of arrival (i.e. Time Of Flight based localization).\n", "Q: AirTag can’t be used to recover stolen item if thief has an iPhone? The AirTag has an anti-stalking mechanism, so than when an unknown AirTag moves with your iPhone you will get a notification.\nThis would mean that a thief who has an iPhone will get notified that the stolen item is being tracked. The thief then can locate the AirTag with their own iPhone and disable it.\nSo for theft situations the AirTag seems to be pretty useless to me.\nAm I missing something? Is there a solution to this built in?\n\nA: AirTags are not marketed by Apple as an anti-theft solution. It is for lost items only (i.e. when you can't remember where you left your car keys in your home).\nIf an AirTag is stolen, the thieve can detect the tag (given that they have an iPhone running a sufficiently new version of iOS) and disable it. Indeed even if they haven't, the AirTag will after a time emit a sound when moved, alerting the thief to its presence. However, you will still be able to see its last known location in Find My.\n", "Q: Is installing Windows on Macbook Pro for Game development good and efficient I have a Macbook PRO, new to game development. Looks like Windows is the recommended OS for game development. Will installing Windows in mac with bootcamp assistantfor Game development good. Is anyone here is doing that? Or continue to use MacOS for game development. Im going to be using Unreal Game Engine.\n\nA: If you look at it objectively, then yes installing Windows in BootCamp is both \"good\" and \"efficient\" in the sense that (a) this is a supported configuration for your computer that will not \"break\" anything, and (b) you'll be able to make full use of the computer's hardware's performance.\nOn the other hand, I don't see you couldn't keep using macOS for game development as well. There's no rule or general recommendation that Windows is always \"best for game development\" - far from it.\nIf you're planning to develop a game for the Mac or for iOS users, I would stick with the Mac. If you're developing a game only for Windows users, there's good arguments for running on the same target as your own users.\n", "Q: Does Magic Mouse automatically sync up with Windows in Boot Camp? I may be just going slightly mad, but hear me out.\nI have a Macbook Pro running Catalina. My Magic Mouse 2 has been paired to it for a while.\nI just installed Windows 10 to dual boot it using Boot Camp.\nNow, I just got out the mouse thinking I needed to pair it again in Windows, but then I noticed it was already paired and working automatically! I really do not recall pairing it in Windows. I could be awfully forgetful and already did it, but I really do not remember doing so!\nDid Apple make some feature in the Boot Camp tools that are installed in Windows causing bluetooth devices such as MM being synced between macOS and Windows?\n\nA: Once the wireless mouse is paired to the Mac, the mouse will work with Windows, the Mac Startup Manager, Mac Recovery, etc. Specific to your question, the Boot Camp Assistant restarts the Mac to boot the Microsoft Windows installer in such a way as to keep the mouse paired with the Mac. When installing Windows without the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant, often (but not always) a user has to plug in a wired mouse to install Windows and pair the wireless mouse after installation completes.\n\nUnless you have installed Windows without the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant, you never realize how many steps are automatically done for you.\n\n", "Q: security dump-keychain -d I'm having troubling finding an details on what -d switch means in security : https://ss64.com/osx/security.html\nIn the commandline :\nsecurity dump-keychain -d login.keychain , what is the use of the \"-d\".\n\nA: Online manpages can be outdated or incomplete.

This link (https://tidbits.com/2019/10/28/redownload-archived-macos-installers-to-address-expired-certificates/) contains links to several versions of macOS.\nThese installers are just applications, and how you download the installer varies depending on which version of the operating system you're trying to download. Recent versions require using the Mac App Store to download. It will show up in your Applications folder. After it's finished downloading, just drag it to your external drive.\nApple doesn't make finding these files easy; it wants everyone to use System Preferences to update or Recovery Mode to reinstall. I suspect that's because it's the best way to make sure you have the most recent version (security patches included).\n", "Q: Password-Protect Apps MacOS Big Sur I need to block an app with a password for privacy, but I can't find this feature in Screentime.\nIt used to be in the old Parental controls in Mojave and earlier, but it seems to have been removed in more recent versions.\n\n*\n\n*free apps preferred\n\nIs there a 3rd party app to block apps with a password?\n\nA: From a quick internet search, I found this article that lists two apps:\n\n*\n\n*AppLocker is free to block one app, with a $10 purchase to unlock full functionality.

I'm a little worried about a process I see in Activity Monitor called 'EscrowSecurityAlert'\nDescriptions provided other forums ranges from it being a sign of malware:\n\nThe threat to your Mac is CleanMyMac. Delete it.\n\nthrough to it being harmless:\n\nThis should be perfectly fine as something\n\nand descriptions I don't understand (I can't think of anything I use that requires 'data escrow'):\n\nEscrow is a data security measure in which acryptographic key is entrusted to a third party (i.e., kept in escrow). Under normal circumstances, the key is not released to someone other than the sender or receiver without proper authorization. Key escrow systems can be considered a security risk at the user puts access to information into the hands of the escrow agent holding the cryptographic key; however, key escrow systems are used to ensure that there is a backup of the cryptographic key in case the parties with access to key lose the data through a disaster or malicious intent.\n\nQuestion\nRegarding the 'EscrowSecurityAlert' process - is this something that ships with macOS or have I installed it myself somehow?\n\nA: Yes, it's part of macOS & has been since perhaps Mavericks.\nWikipedia lists it in List of macOS components but provides no description -\nThe iPhone Wiki gives a brief description\n\nThis application works with the iCloud Keychain servers. It manages the password uploads and anything that keychain tools does.\n\nBy definition an escrow service is one who acts as a middle-man in a complex or expensive process. It is often used when buying/selling a house. The escrow company holds both the deeds and the money until all parties have completed the legal requirements to transfer the property, preventing either one from 'running off with the money'.\nIn computing terms it is an arbitrator between two not-necessarily-yet-trusted 'clients'. It prevents any data from one leaking to the other until full trust is established. In effect, it doesn't let anything 'run off with the money'.\nThis is, in effect, a less mind-numbing version of your last link & quote.\n\nA: /System/Library/CoreServices/EscrowSecurityAlert.app is part of macOS and is involved in the configuration and maintenance of the iCloud Keychain security code.\nFor example, prompts for entering the code to configure a new device with access to the Keychain.\nIf you've ever seen one of these messages, it's a dialog from this app:\n\n*\n\n*ESCROW_ELE_ALERT_MESSAGE\n\nCreate New iCloud Security Code\nA new security code must be created because of a change to iCloud Keychain servers.\n\n(Apple wrote a support article about this message: If you're asked to create a new iCloud security code)\n\n\n*RECORD_BURNED_ALERT_MESSAGE\n\nUpdate Your iCloud Security Code\nYour security code was incorrectly entered too many times on one of your other devices and can no longer be used.\n\n\n\n*RESET_CONFIRMATION_MESSAGE\n\nReset and Turn Off iCloud Keychain?\nAll passwords in iCloud Keychain will be deleted, and iCloud Keychain will be turned off on all your devices.\n\n", "Q: Why is healthissues.today using my screen 24/7 on my iPhone and how do I stop it?

But now: How do I wire it up so it adds the key to my keychain?\n\nA: Keychain integration is a feature added by Apple that is not in the standard release of OpenSSH. As you have now installed the standard OpenSSH release from HomeBrew, you won't have this functionality anymore. You have discovered this as the UseKeychain option now gives configuration errors - adding the IgnoreUnknown configuration only makes the error message go away, it won't actually bring back any functionality.\nIn order to get Keychain integration, you will want to uninstall the HomeBrew version of OpenSSH and use the version supplied by Apple.\nThe version in HomeBrew will not for the foreseeable future have Keychain integration - it's not that they can't make it work at all, but rather that they have found the implementation that was made to be too big a risk for the project, as it's a big change that doesn't come from the OpenSSH project itself. You can read about that discussion here.\nIf you look at the link, you'll see that you can still download the old patch, and try that out if you like. However, as it is no longer maintained, it is a security risk.\nSimilarly you can download a third party mod to add Keychain support here. However that hasn't been updated since 2017 it seems, and as such would also be a security risk.\n", "Q: How can I deactivate the speaker on the Airtags?

How can I still change my passcode?\n\n\nA: To verify your identity to reset the Screen Time passcode, you log in with your Apple ID. In your screenshot, it says ‘Sign in to iCloud…’ implying it’s not currently logged in.

Fonts I want are included in in the files fonts.dir, fonts.scale and fonts.list. I've verified the fonts I want are in Font Book in User.\nI think I'm missing something pretty obvious, but can't seem to find it. How can I get TTF fonts made available for use by X11?\n\nA: So it turns out that xlsfonts does not list all fonts known, but rather either only the X server's fonts, or the fonts that are dealt with “classically”. fc-list will list the fonts that are dealt with in a more modern fashion (or that are on the X client?).\nIn the case of xterm, use the -fa flag to use TTF (and other non-bitmapped?) fonts. For example, if xset q shows directory X in the font path, and directory X has a fonts.dir file (made by running, e.g., mkfontdir X) and a fonts.scale file (made by running, e.g., mkfontscale X), and you've run fc-cache -v, you should be able to run (e.g.) fc-list someFontName and see all the styles that font contains, and be able to xterm -fa 'Input Mono:style=Regular', assuming Input Mono is a known font.\n", "Q: Issues with the SSD storage system on Mac OS I need of some help with a Mac book pro’s SSD storage.\nCurrently running Mac OS Catalina Version 10.15.4 with a flash storage drive with 121 GB of space.\nFor some reason, the system keeps running out of virtual memory, and when I check the storage manager it displays a lot of odd behavior.\n\nI get this error message all the time, and it’s not possible to turn off automatically. I think though for this one, it has to do with the browser taking up a lot of space, so if I check the browser’s task manager I can see which tabs are taking up a lot of space, and I close them to free up some virtual memory space.\nBut the problem has more to do with the overall storage on the flash storage drive. When I open the storage manager it shows that about 50% of my disk space is going to other. That’s a lot of space.\n\n\nIn the screenshot above, I wish I could show the time, because I think something tricky is going on, after a half second, 15GB disappear from the other category (from the first image to the second, they were only taken a second apart). So I think my memory problems are coming from the way the OS is coded.\nAnd often the only way to get through these memory issues is to restart the computer -- which for some reason removes a lot of virtual space. I think the new SSD drives treat virtual memory almost like RAM or a cache system now days, way different than the physical disk drivers from before.\nWhat I was wondering, is there anyone out there that can point me in the right direction or link me to some articles or tutorials on how to go about debugging this?\nI currently reading up on Kernel Programming, but I bet Apple isn’t going to allow me to fix this myself.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/vm/vm.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000905-CH210-BEHJDFCA\nCould anybody point me in the right direction on how to fix this?\n\nA: Several points to make  here:\nFirst and foremost - the difference between the two screenshots is not just that the \"Other\" category shrunk. If this was the case, I can understand why you argue that this must a bug of some sort. However, if you look closely you'll see that a new row appeared named \"Other Users\" - and this accounts for the changed numbers as it takes up 12,49 GB of its own.\nEssentially when you open that window, the system displays the information currently available to it - while at the same time scheduling a new calculation in the background. This means traversing part of a disk index in order to group the storage used into meaningful categories.  In your case that means that another user on your Mac has 12,49 GB of files in their account.\nThis is by no means a consequence of \"how the OS is coded\", nor are your memory problems caused by \"OS coding\". The window you're looking at, and the calculations that continually update, are not in any way part of the operating system kernel.\nI would strongly recommend using a program such as Disk Inventory X or DaisyDisk to locate large files, and see if there's something you can do without, or perhaps move to secondary storage, in order to clear up space.\nThe reason you're seeing the \"Force Quit Applications\" window a lot is that you have programs running that are filling up your physical RAM. As you have a relatively small capacity of 8 GB of RAM, programs like Google Chrome will quickly fill it up. Some times you can save lots of memory by using alternative browsers such as Safari or Firefox. You could also consider upgrading the RAM capacity, if that is possible with your model of laptop.\nNormally though, applications filling up the RAM won't result in the \"Force Quit Applications\" window. Instead the operating system would automatically use part of the disk drive to offload RAM in order to keep all applications running - a process known as \"swapping\". If this happens a lot, you will end up with a slower system - however you won't have to quit applications. When your disk is completely full, as yours seem to be, swapping becomes impossible, and you'll have to quit applications instead.\nContrary to your statements, it is not so that this process is different with SSD than with traditional hard drives. It is exactly the same process. Swapping is done in exactly the same way with SSDs as with traditional hard drives. However, as SSDs are usually much faster, the performance hit taken by swapping is not as severe here.\nThe reason rebooting your Mac helps is because this stops all the running programs - and thus reclaims all RAM they have been using. This also means that any disk space used for swapping is reclaimed as the programs using that space are no longer running. This is why you see the amount of free disk space go up a bit after rebooting. If you continue to run the memory hogging programs, the amount of free disk space will go down again eventually when the system swaps data out from RAM.\nHowever, none of the above is because the operating system uses \"SSDs as system cache\", or because SSDs are treated differently than \"disk drives from before\".\nI wouldn't recommend that you spend time on researching kernel programming for solving this problem. Judging from your questions, you'll have an extremely long learning curve, as you would first need to understand how operating systems work, and the basic concepts. However, it is not so that Apple \"won't let you\" fix this problem - nor that they \"won't let you\" do kernel programming. You can do all the kernel programming you want.\nHowever, it is completely the wrong direction to take in order to solve this problem, as it is not caused by an operating system bug, or a deficiency in operating system functionality compared to other common desktop operating systems.\n", "Q: How do I get an app from my old phone onto a new phone without updating the app (via IPA file)? Using an icloud backup will result in the newest version being loaded, so I think I need to make an IPA file of the app and use configurator to load it onto my new phone. However, I need an IPA of the current version I have, not the updated version. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: This can be done from Configurator 2 if and only if you already have the .ipa file.\niTunes used to sync .ipa files back from the phone as part of the backup strategy. This practise stopped some years ago & has since relied entirely on OTA downloads of current versions from the App Store.\nIt may be possible to use the older & now unsupported last version of iTunes that allowed this, to extract an .ipa from the current phone, which you could then re-sync to a newer phone… assuming it will run on the newer phone.\nThe link to the last version of this 12.6.x.x is here - Apple KB: Deploy apps in a business environment with iTunes however it appears it will not run in later macOS versions without some effort. See MacRumors: iTunes 12.6.5.3 on MacOS Catalina and also apparently will still work for an iPhone 8, but not an 11 - Reddit: Does iTunes 12.6.5.3 work with iOS 14?\nAll of this does imply it might be a tougher job than it once was. I cannot test any of this empirically, I'm afraid.\nAs a long shot, you may have the .ipa buried deep within Time Machine, if it goes back far enough. This was actually how I achieved a similar task a few years ago.\n\nA: @Tetsujin is correct, mostly. In the spirit of completeness:\nThere are 3rd party iOS backup programs that will do this. I got iMazing as part of an app bundle and found it to be my most useful app. Note that I hold no interest in the company that develops the app, just a happy user.\niMazing (I believe iExplore as well) will back up the.ipa files to your Mac. Once they are on your Mac you can then restore them to another iOS device.\nObviously this will take up a fair bit more disk space on your Mac as you are storing the iOS apps there as well. Also I think it has a free trial period, so that you could verify that it does what you need it to do before committing your hard earned $$.\n", "Q: Safari mute tab while it isn't playing audio In Safari 14 on macOS Big Sur 11.2.1, How can I mute the current tab in Safari when it isn't playing audio right now?\n\nA: I don't think you can.\nEven if you add a key command, it simply doesn't respond & stays greyed-out unless there is actually audio playing. It doesn't even highlight if video is playing, if it has no sound.\n", "Q: Does Apple Mail verify message has been moved to new folder before deleting it from old folder? I am using Apple Mail and switch email providers. I want to Move my messages from one account to another. I need to be confident that when I move (not Copy) messages from one account to another account using Apple Mail, that the messages are truly on the new account before they are deleted from the old account.\nDoes Apple Mail verify the new message has been stored (committed) to the new account before it deletes it from the old account?\nThank you.\n\nA: Through my own testing, I have been able to confirm that Apple Mail will return mail to the original folder if there are any issues moving it to the new account/folder.\nAt first, Apple Mail will show the mail message(s) as deleted from the original folder, then if/when an issue occurs that prevents the message(s) from being saved to the new account/folder, the message(s) will be returned to the original account/folder.\n", "Q: Does Apple Mail prevent duplicates from being created in the same folder when copying/moving messages and how? I am migrating email from one email provider to another using Apple Mail. I want to make sure that I do not accidentally create duplicates as some emails are duplicated in various sources.\nIf I try to copy the same email from two different sources into the same folder, does Apple Mail prevent the duplicate from being stored?\nIf so, does anyone know how Apple Mail determines if the email message is a duplicate (same body, subject, from, to, etc)?\n\nA: Not only does Mail not prevent the presence of duplicate messages (2 messages with identical headers and contents, including time stamps), but it (or iCloud) sometimes creates duplicates (buggy behavior). These can be hidden in Mail.app but you will see them in iCloud-Mail (via Safari) or with another mail client such as Outlook.\nIf you need to delete duplicates you may want to have a look as https://www.macworld.com/article/2046576/how-to-delete-duplicate-email-messages.html .\n", "Q: By what principle does the AirTag work? I hope to understand it so that I can also tell whether the following situations work:\nFirst of all, does an AirTag talk to any unencrypted Wifi or cellular tower, or random people who walk by and have the BlueTooth turned on?\nSo by understanding what principles it works by, then I hope to know whether the following situations can work:\n\n*\n\n*If I want the AirTag to be able to tell where my car is parked, or where that AppleTV remote control (with the AirTag attached) is, and I had an iPhone near me all the time.\n\n\n*If I leave an AirTag in my car's cup holder, and yesterday night, I parked my car 2 streets way, and I didn't have my iPhone with me, so today, can I use my iPhone to find my car? What if the car is more than 200 or 500 feet away?\n\n\n*What if the AirTag is attached to a Belkin string attachment and is taped to the back of the Apple TV remote control. Then if the remote is dropped under the bed and is out of battery, can the AirTag still tell where it is when the battery has run out of power?\n\n\n*What if our cat or dog took the key and the AirTag, and bury it somewhere in the backyard or in a park nearby?  So all this time, there was no iPhone nearby (assuming I am not at home).\n\nA: No, AirTags do not communicate over WiFi (unencrypted or encrypted), nor does it communicate with cell towers. It does communicate over Bluetooth and UWB, and the signals it emit can be received by random people walking by, if they're within range.\nYour situations:\n\n*\n\n*Yes, AirTags can help you pinpoint the location of your AppleTV remote with an AirTag attached to you. It is best at doing so if you have a newer iPhone (11+). For your car it depends on how big the parking lot is, and how often other people will walk around the parking lot near your car.\n\n\n*Yes, you can come back the next day to locate your AirTag even though you didn't have the phone with you when you left the AirTag. If the AirTag is so far from you that you cannot receive its signals, you must rely on some other iPhone user being sufficiently near the AirTag at some point.\n\n\n*Your question is a bit ambigious. The use of the Belkin string attachment has no impact on whether or not you can find the AirTag. If you mean that the AppleTV remote has run out of battery, that again has no impact on whether or not you can find the AirTag. If the AirTag itself has run out of power, then you cannot use the very precise location method that shows you the angle and distance to the AirTag. It is possible to see the last known location of the AirTag on a map even when out of battery. Note that AirTags have a fairly long battery life.\n\n\n*This depends on how deep the AirTag is buried and what kind of material is on top of it. The AirTag does not know it is buried - it will still emit its signals, and if there's a receiver (i.e. someone with an iPhone) in range, you can get notified about the position of the lost AirTag.\n", "Q: iOS 14.5 - Podcast app does not show previously played episodes I updated my iPhone 7 to iOS 14.5.

The iMac is running exactly the same OS.\nThe cables I have are Thunderbolt into Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 adapter.\nWhen I press Command + F2 absolutely nothing happens, no sound, no change on screen at all.\n\nA: Macbook's with USB-C ports do not support Thunderbolt 3 and therefore the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter can not be used for Target Display Mode. See Use your iMac as a display with target display mode and About the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter\nHowever, if your new MacBook really is a 2020 MacBook Pro, then your question is a duplicate of Target Display Mode not working on MacBook Pro 13\" 2020.

However, I have a 2013 iMac with High Sierra and Catalina installed. When running Catalina, Target Display Mode works for video, but not for sound.\n\nA: The solution was that the iMac was running Catalina and that was too new an OS for target display.

What it says on the tin.\nBalenaEtcher straight up doesn't offer the option to select individual partitions and UnetBootin... well, straight up will not open. I click, it'll ask if I'm sure I want to open it, and then the icon will pop in and right out of the dock.\nAlso, what I'm doing this for is to attempt installing Windows 7 on a partition of the boot drive and then upgrade it to 10 from inside the install itself so I can 1. Work with a sub-4GB ISO file which apparently makes software happier and 2. Upgrade from pirated to legit Windows. There very possibly may be flaws with this plan (especially since the Boot Camp drivers in another partition of the drive in question are made for Windows 10) so if there are feel free to let me know.\n\nA: Your model Mac is suppose to be Windows 7 compatible. Windows 7 should include SP1 or later. The Boot Camp Assistant included with macOS can be used to install Windows. There is a chance Mojave will not allow the installation of Windows 7. In this case, the easiest solution would be to install High Sierra to a new volume in the same APFS container as Mojave. You can then use the Boot Camp Assistant from High Sierra to install Widows 7. After Windows 7 SP1 is installed, you can remove the High Sierra volume. The Boot Camp Assistant will probably inform you that you will have to manually copy the Windows Support Software to the flash drive. There will be a link to the website with further instructions. After installing Windows 7, you can upgrade to Windows 10. After you successfully active Windows 10, you can elect to use the Boot Camp Assistant to remove Windows and reinstall a clean version of Windows 10. This version should automatically activate. Also, the clean install of Windows 10 should UEFI boot.\n", "Q: \"Critical software update required for your Mac\" loop after erasing EFI partition So I accidentally erased the EFI partition when I was trying to erase my usb and im now stuck in a \"Critical software update required for your Mac\" loop, Ive already tried: resetting nvram and pram, reinstalling macOS big sur from recovery mode, using a mobile hotspot and updating in safe boot but none of them worked, what can I still do to solve this problem?\nI also cannot wipe my disk.\ndiskutil list internal:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:       Microsoft Basic Data EFI                     313.5 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         500.0 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +500.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD - Data     369.1 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 503.7 MB   disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                622.1 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      1.1 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            15.3 GB    disk1s5\n   6:              APFS Snapshot com.apple.os.update-... 15.3 GB    disk1s5s1\n\nI finally got a disk to back up the mac and I was able to clean install big sur and that solved it.

Online I can find screenshots of a dialog that looks like similar this but has a search bar at the top. That version also has an icon in the top right that switches to the expanded dialog that I'm used to. But as you can see neither of those exist in the screenshot above, and I don't know how to make them appear.\nIs there a way to search for unicode symbols from this dialog, or switch it to the old one, or is there some other convenient way to search for unicode symbols in Catalina? I sometimes need to use obscure mathematical symbols, and it's not really feasible to find them by just scrolling through the list.\n\nA: Uh, I always figure these things out myself immediately after posing the question. Here's the solution - I hope it will be helpful for someone else:\nTo search for characters, you just press ctrl-CMD-space to bring the dialog up and then start typing. The search bar appears as soon as you type something, along with the button that switches to the \"character viewer\" window.

(Or at least, they 'loosened' it sufficiently that it has subsequently broken.)\nFrankly, your school has given you a 10-year-old laptop, with no battery, and a broken trackpad. (And a startup disk called \"aaaaaa\".) Because there's no battery, the CPU performance will be throttled at best.\nAt worst, the power adapter can’t supply enough current at all times to even make the OS stable.

So sad\nEveryone help me please\n\nA: Brother recommends using AirPrint with Big Sur. Unfortunately, your model does not support AirPrint. As an alternative, Brother recommends you download Brother iPrint&Scan from the Apple App Store. Note: Most reviews for the Brother iPrint&Scan software are not very good.\nWhen viewing the Downloads webpage, there is no printer driver available for macOS 11. Therefore I would assume Brother will not be releasing a printer driver for your current macOS 11.3.1.\n\nA: The good news is that the Brother MFC-1910W fully supports macOS 11 \"Big Sur\", as you can see in the printer's Supported OS page:\n\nThe bad news is that the printer doesn't support AirPrint, a feature in macOS (and iOS) that supports printing without installing printer-specific drivers. In my experience, AirPrint is especially convenient for MFPs because of its support for scanning.\nI'd recommend that you return the printer and purchase one that supports AirPrint. Check Apple's AirPrint device list for a complete list of supported devices.\nIf that's not an option, you will have to install iPrint&Scan from the Mac App Store (the Mobile Print/Scan Guide for Brother iPrint&Scan (Apple Devices), although it applies to iPhones/iPads, may be helpful).\n", "Q: How do I select non contiguous Numbers spreadsheet cells using applescript?

The method, whatever it is, is private, but I only need this for myself (not a public app).\nIs it possible to use dtrace or dtruss to figure out what the System Preferences app is doing to signal the OS to update its cache for a particular checkbox?   I want to write an Objective-C program to do the same thing, but I need a dtrace/dtruss expert to help me.\n\nA: macOS uses NSUserDefaults to implement defaults. It offers an Objective-C interface and is part of the Foundation framework used by System Preferences and most applications to deal with preferences.\nCaching of defaults is handled by the framework and the calling application is not expected to know about or manipulate the cache. See NSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification and Key Value Observation (KVO) for how applications can track changes.\nCFPreferencesSynchronize\nNSUserDefaults itself is implemented with the C based CFPreferences set of functions, found in CoreFoundation framework.\nIn this layer, the documentation for the function CFPreferencesSynchronize reads:\n\nThis function is the primitive synchronize mechanism for the higher level preference function CFPreferencesAppSynchronize it writes updated preferences to permanent storage, and reads the latest preferences from permanent storage.\nOnly the exact domain specified is modified. Note that to modify “Any User” preferences requires root privileges (or Admin privileges prior to OS X v10.6)—see Authorization Services Programming Guide.\nDo not use this function directly unless you have a specific need. All arguments must be non-NULL. Do not use arbitrary user and host names, instead pass the pre-defined constants.\n\nmacOS 11.2 is partly open source. Be sure to check if defaults is part of the open section. This may be useful in determining which domains and suites the preferences affect.\n\nA: I have a solution.  The secret is to manipulate the macOS SpeechSynthesisServer.app after changing the Time Announce preference setting using defaults write.  There is no saved copy of the settings, and no special Objective-C process is needed.  (Dale Sedivec helped via email after I read his June 2019 post about System Preferences at assert.cc).\nTo turn \"Announce the time:\" ON:\ndefaults write ./com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs TimeAnnouncementPrefs -dict-add TimeAnnouncementsEnabled -bool YES   \nopen /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/SpeechSynthesis.framework/Versions/A/SpeechSynthesisServer.app\n\nTo turn \"Announce the time:\" OFF:\ndefaults write ./com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs TimeAnnouncementPrefs -dict-add TimeAnnouncementsEnabled -bool NO    \nkillall SpeechSynthesisServer # takes effect after 30 seconds\n\nIn both cases, re-launching System Preferences causes the System Preferences GUI to show the new Time Announce checkbox setting.  The launching or killing of SpeechSynthesisServer.app causes the OS to respect the new setting.  I'm using Keyboard Maestro to do this.\n", "Q: Send a notification to my iPhone when a website's content changes I would like to be notified quickly (ideally within an hour) if a certain website (that is not under my control) changes.

My understanding is that iCloud can't do this, and you have to manually share or add to a shared album.\nRight now we're using Google Photos as an alternative - just set Google Photos to use partner sharing, and turn on automatic backup. However, Google Photos is getting ready to end unlimited storage, and I'd rather not pay for their space since I'm already paying for iCloud.

I found that memory swapping is less when the MacBook is newly booted up, and more when I don't shut down for a few days.\n\nHowever, I cannot find any relation why that is the case, or is that just a coincidence? I also got similar results when I use iStatMenus 6. Here is the recent 7 day results (white portion is when the computer is shutted down):\n\nIt seems like kernel_task is writing more the longer I leave it on, but I don't see any correlations between the two. I am using similar apps each day. Also, I am currently not worried about my SSD life because it is only writing 30GB per day max, and I have 100% SSD lifetime. Thanks for answering.\n\nA: kernel_task is not an actual process like the others you see in Activity Monitor, it is a kind of “virtual process” that actually represents the kernel itself.\nThis means that it is not kernel_task itself that performs some job and in the process writes to disk, rather the kernel is continually (many, many times per second often) asked by your running programs to do stuff on their behalf.\nYou won’t find any “template” or “fixed model” for how kernel_task behaves, as that depends on whatever the rest of the programs on your computer is doing.\nYou also write about swapping. This is done when the amount of free RAM is not sufficient to cover the requests from running programs. These requests are dependent on whatever you’re doing with your computer. For example if you’re running a web browser, some sites might require almost no RAM to display - and others might require lots and lots of RAM.\nAs for why it tends to be more after running your computer for a long time - that is actually quite logical. Over time you have probably run more and more different programs, have more things loaded in (open documents, web site tabs, etc), and even more that contribute to your total RAM Usage than when you just booted the computer.\nSome programs might also leak memory due to bugs This means that long running programs request some memory, and then forget about it, never giving it back to the operating system, even though they’re no longer using it. The longer you keep programs running, the more leaks you’ll eventually have. You can reclaim the leaked memory by closing the program - or by rebooting the computer.\n", "Q: Getting error on opening Microsoft remote desktop: The file “com.microsoft.rdc.application-data.sqlite” couldn’t be opened My mac has turned off due to a power cut.

I learned that you can do this by writing simple Automator services and then making keyboard shortcuts to those services (under System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services). I followed the instructions here and I now have the Automator service I need in place and I can also tell it to use a shortcut like ⌥+⌘+T to open it.\nHowever, I don't want to use ⌥+⌘+T to open a terminal. I would like to use ⌘+return instead. When I try to do that, System Preferences acts as though I haven't specified any shortcut at all; I think it doesn't like to set up shortcuts involving the return key. It lets you use most other keys though, as far as I can tell. (aside: I played around and it looks like the only keys you aren't allowed to use in this menu are return, delete, caps lock and fn.)\nDoes anyone know a way to work around that?\n\n*\n\n*An ideal workaround would let me set it up directly in the System Preferences Menu.

In such cases, a performance penalty is of no consequence.\nThe only discussion I can find is here, though I don't find it particularly convincing or authoritative.\n\nA: Yes, in theory it is possible to emulate a M1 Mac on an Intel Mac. As such there's nothing \"magical\" about the M1.\nHowever in practice you're going to run into various problems, mainly that there's no readily available software that does this. You can get much of the way of emulating the CPU itself using qemu. qemu already supports emulating various aarch64 CPUs, but it doesn't emulate the M1 and its Apple-specific instructions (yet), nor does it emulate the rest of the SoC or the rest of the Mac's peripheral units.\nLast there's the question of legality.

Click the image, then if you see a magnifying glass with a + in it when you hover your cursor over the letters, click again so it goes beyond your window size [or repeatedly tap  Cmd ⌘   +  until it no longer fits the window].\nHold Shift & scroll mouse wheel.\n\nIt would be interesting to know if this affects trackpads too, but I don't have one to test.\n\nA: Update\nNow seems to be fixed in latest release of AdGuard.\n\nIt's an issue with AdGuard, specifically the Web Annoyances Ultralist.\nReported to the developers in https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/82833\nwith a dev response\n\nOk, better disable this filter. It can break something in Safari, also our filters compiler has one issue AdguardTeam/SafariConverterLib#21\nAfter release which will contain the fix for problem above, you can try that filter again.\n\nI have that filter disabled for now & will test again after the next release.\n", "Q: New M1 Macbook Pro, warranty expired I bought a new MacBook Pro with an M1 chip today from a third-party supplier. After all of the setup, I found that its warranty was listed as expired.\nThis model released earlier this year and is definitely not over 1 year old. I used Geekbench to test it and all marks looks good.\nDoes anyone has any idea on what I could do?\n\nA: A call to Apple support or web interaction would let you provide purchase information to correct an accounting error on the registration. This has been true for a decade and isn’t specific to the M1 Mac.\nTo get to this, open the “About this Mac” item from the Apple menu or use this handy web site - https://support.apple.com/repair-products\n\nSelect the service tab and then the check my coverage status. Apple doesn’t need you to provide anything but a receipt that you obtained from your seller in most cases.\nAlso keep in mind, sales into some countries mean you have to provide proof of purchase or seek support first from the person you bought the product or a company in the region of first sale instead of Apple directly.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/statutoryrights.html\nHopefully you didn’t buy a Mac that didn’t even finish manufacturing by Apple or was stolen directly from Apple. I clearly can’t know what information an Apple agent would find in their research to decline coverage. There are so many edge cases you may not have considered that someone at Apple not only has faced multiple times, but had to write a playbook for how to handle these rare cases so they’re being consistent and not “shooting from the hip” call by call. One might be if you had a Mac they used in store for a display and it was stolen during a robbery. I could understand the call asking for support on those Macs to be a short one and read from a script that is designed to bring the call to a quick conclusion.\n", "Q: How to download macOS-Catalina-10.15 I'm looking to download a macOS-Catalina-10.15 but can't find it anywhere on the web nor the apple website. Could anyone help find a safe site, preferably apple to download? Thanks.\nI have a Macbook-Pro\n\nA: Mr. Macintosh lists 8 ways of getting macOS installers. All get them from Apple though some involve running scripts to make it easier. I suggest one of these:\nMethod 1. The easiest way (if your Mac is eligible) is via the App Store.\nMethod 8: Direct Apple links to some installers.\nMethod 5: For myself, I often the Mac Deploy Stick (MDS).  This is 3rd party software (aimed at those who administer many MACs), but inspects what is available from Apple and downloads what you choose.\nBut select a method for yourself. All download from Apple.\n\nA: Here is an official apple support page about the installation of older macOS versions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683\nThere you can find a link for Catalina.\n\nA: To download MacOS Catalina, you need to search the App Store for Catalina and download/install it from there.\n", "Q: Numbers: How do I make it display the full year I have a Numbers spreadsheet that shows the date as 5/6/21, but I want it to display the dates as 5/6/2021, the full year.

Here, choose \"Date & Time\" and configure the Date entry to an option with full years.\nRead more in this Apple Support document: https://support.apple.com/guide/numbers/format-dates-currency-and-more-tan23393f3a/mac\n\n", "Q: How do you find an AirTag on the web How do you find an AirTag on the web using iCloud.com's FindMyiPhone (not the app?)\n\nA: AirTags can only be tracked with Find My app, either on an iPhone/iPad or Mac - but not on the web.\nInstructions from Apple for locating and AirTag:\n\nOpen the Find My app, then tap the Items tab.\nChoose the AirTag you want to locate in the Items list.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210967\n\nA: You can't find it on the web using https://www.icloud.com/find.\nIt is only visible in the owner's iPhone via the Find My app. It works away from the owner's phone.\nBasically, it updates its location every time the tag finds any iPhone around.\n\nA: It doesn't have a built-in GPS signal sender, so it can only be used by your cell-phone App which means the range is under 15 meters.\n", "Q: New iTerm2 Window Here option open two tabs When I right-clicked a folder and choose the services -> New iTerm2 Window Here option in the menu, I am getting two iTerm2 windows like this.\n\nBut I don't need that root level terminal here (The right side terminal of the image), because I only need this folder path terminal only. How can I stop this behavior?\n\nA: There is open issue iterm2 opens two window or two tabs when launched from services where possible workarounds are described (also root cause of the problem as well).\nFrom productivity point (if you end in shell anyway) you could consider switching to console based file manager (like vifm, ranger, nnn, Midnight Commander etc). You will get productivity boost from relying on keyboard only. There is also command-line fuzzy-finder fzf which could be handy.\n\nA: I found a solution that works, I left iTerm2 Settings > General > Startup as Use System Window Restoration Setting and also left Advanced > Enable session restoration on. I changed the setting under Advanced > Open a window at startup? to No. Now everything works as you would expect, I startup iTerm2 and it opens one window, I quit and open a folder from Finder in iTerm2 and it starts with that directory and only one window.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Macbook Pro high CPU temp I am currently using a macbook pro 16'' 2019 with intel i7.\nI am doing some calculation about molecules geometry and wavefunctions with some chemical professional software.\nThey are very CPU intensive and can use up to 4 core during calculation with OPENMPI.\nI've seen with Intel Power Gadget that the CPU temperature is in range 85-96 C degrees.\nIs it normal?\nCan theese temperatures damage my laptop or there is even the risk of a battery explosion?\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro is a sophisticated product, with very capable power management and controls to prevent over-heating.\nIt is designed to be used, and to work hard if needed. You do not need to monitor the temperature, and you cannot damage your computer through use.\nIntel CPUs can run over 100˚C quite normally. Your Mac has fans, which will speed up to increase cooling, and the OS will throttle the CPU if it gets too hot. In extremis, the CPU will shut off, rather than get so hot that damage might occur.\nThere is no way that Apple could, or would, sell a laptop whose battery was at risk of explosion as a consequence of high CPU usage. (Well, not without a recall or a lawsuit.)\n", "Q: Prevent icon from appearing in my Mac's Dock when I text on my iPhone I don't want iMessage on my MacBook anymore, at all.  I've signed out of all accounts on my MacBook but when I start a text on my phone, this creepy icon appears, so it still knows I'm texting. \nI've read various related questions here, here, here and here but they're not quite getting at the same thing.\nDoes anyone know how to prevent this?  I'm running Big Sur and hadn't noticed this previously, but I tend to leave a while before updates (precisely because there's always something annoying like this).\n\nA: When an app appears in the Dock with a badge that looks like a stylized iPhone:\n\nmacOS is making you aware that you started something on another device (a Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch) and you could pick it up on your Mac. This functionality is called Handoff.\nTo turn it off:\n\n*\n\n*Launch System Preferences and click General\n\n\n*At the bottom of the pane, deselect “Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices”:\n\nMore information about Handoff\nHandoff is one of a set of integration features called Continuity (other Continuity features include Universal Clipboard and Sidecar).\nApple recently added an article about Handoff to the Mac App Store app:\n\n", "Q: Export emails but keep them searchable I've got a couple of mailboxes for old businesses on my MacMail. I keep them there because there are loads of emails, and I may need them in the future. The reason I haven't just exported them and archived them is that I still want them to show up in search results when I search through my emails.\nThe problems I have are:\n\n*\n\n*I keep getting notifications that I have to put the passwords in for these mailboxes. That's very frustrating.\n\n*For some reason, something keeps blocking my IP address from one of the business' domain name. Any time I log onto a different wifi, it blocks that IP address too. I suspect it's something to do with invalid details on one of these mailboxes (but if it could be anything else, please let me know).\n\nMy ideal solution would be to have these mailboxes sat there, but completely inactive, not connected to the internet in anyway, just a repository for a bunch of emails. But I may have to face facts that I may need to delete them altogether, exporting the emails first. But then they won't be included in the search. Is there any way I can have my cake and eat it?\n\nA: You can move the emails to a 'mailbox' which is only on your Mac.   The instructions here assume you have the latest version of macOS and Apple Mail, but older versions are much the same.\n\n*\n\n*In Mail's sidebar on the left you should see \"On My Mac\". With the\nmouse, hover, click on the disclosure triangle to show the mailboxes\n(folders) inside \"On My Mac\".\n\n\n*Create a new mailbox (folder) by clicking on the + symbol.  You may\nwant to create multiple mailboxes to keep your emails organised. You\ncan even create a tree structure if you want.\n\n\n*Then just drag and drop (with the Command key pressed) your old\nbusiness emails from the external mailboxes into your new mailboxes\nwithin \"On My Mac\". The command key ensures that you do a copy (not a\nmove) as you probably don't yet want to delete them from the external\nservice.\n\n\n*Alternatively use 'Copy to' from the Message menu.\n\n\n*You can now disconnect from the old mail services.\nThe emails will be indexed (it will take a little) and be available to Mail's search.\nBecause the emails are now stored just on your Mac, you become responsible for ensuring your backups are sound.\n", "Q: How to reset Mac user password while having working TouchID access Do to the some reason I have not figured out yet, after having changed my MBP password (via the boot screen password expiration overlay triggered by jamf) I can't seem to authenticate with either the old or the new password, yet I can still use my TouchID to login.\nHow can I reset my password given that I am still able to authenticate with TouchID?\nI assumed that getting a root shell would allow me to reset the password with passwd but can't get past sudo -i without a valid password.\nSince I can authorise with TouchID I tried opening the root terminal with applescript:\ndo shell script \"/usr/bin/open -a iTerm .  & > /dev/null 2>&1 &  \" with administrator privileges\n\nThe script triggers the ootb GUI authentication dialog which I can approve with TouchID, and it shows the iterm2 terminal window in root mode, but the window is not interactive, i.e. it does not accept any keystrokes.\nIs there any possible solution out of this other than backing up everything while I still have access to files, and then reinstall the OS from scratch? (FileVault is enabled.)\n\nA: Proceed at your own risk\nYou can try to add TouchId as a method to authenticate sudo.\nIn Finder go /etc/pam.d/, copy sudo to your desktop.\nEdit this file in a text editor and add auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so as top line. It should look like:\n# sudo: auth account password session\nauth       sufficient     pam_tid.so\nauth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so\nauth       required       pam_opendirectory.so\naccount    required       pam_permit.so\npassword   required       pam_deny.so\nsession    required       pam_permit.so\n\nNow copy this sudo file to /etc/pam.d/. Finder will ask you if you want to replace the existing file. If you select replace, Finder will ask you to authorise the action via TouchID.\nFrom that point on you can invoke sudo with TouchID.\n", "Q: Internal hard disk won't wipe, can't reinstall OS because not enough disk space My MacBook Pro 2017 (running Big Sur) is not booting.

I will attach the text of the document below.\nso I viewed a diff between /etc/group and ~/Desktop/.../group.system_default and saw that\nthe line containing _trustd:*:282:_trustd exists in group.system_default but not in /etc/group.\nAnother odd thing I realized is the 'Date modified' on the file on group.system_default is 1. Jan 2020. This computer and the install are both from 2021.\nCan somebody explain what is going on? I am not sure which of the files came with the macos-update and which I suposedly modified in the previous version.\nI also don't understand what _trustd:*:282:_trustd means.\nDocument in Relocated Items Directory\n\nDuring the last macOS upgrade or file migration, some of your files couldn’t be moved to their\nnew locations.

The modified files are\nin the Configuration folder, organised in subfolders named after their original locations.\nTo restore any of the custom configurations, compare your modifications with the configuration\nchanges made during the macOS upgrade and combine them when possible.\nConfiguration files with the suffix \"system_default\" were edited or customised but the changes\nwere allowed to remain installed. The system_default version of the file is provided to\ndemonstrate what the Apple-supplied version of this file would look like.\nIt is recommended you compare the two and evaluate whether you wish to integrate any changes\nApple may have made to the default version.\n\n\nA: My policy is that it falls into the category of \"Nothing to worry about\" and I delete them every time with no noticeable side-effects. (At worst, the system_defaults files will be restored to Relocated Items on the next system update.)\nBut Apple does seem to be saying \"You have some system files which are different from their defaults, so instead of restoring the defaults, we're going to leave them here, and let you decide which one you should install.\"\n... which is a very un-Apple thing to do.\n\nA: To your question, which file is the modified one, the document you've added already explains that:\n\nConfiguration files with the suffix \"system_default\" were edited or\ncustomised but the changes were allowed to remain installed\n\n...which means your current file \"group\" is the modified one and \"group.system_default\" is the default one, but wasn't installed, because the changes to \"group\" were allowed.\n\n_trustd:*:282:_trustd\n\n...is a user of the same named group on your computer, as also found in \"Directory Utility.app\" (for which you can search in Spotlight).\n\"282\" is the \"PrimaryGroupID\".\nThe man pages for trustd mention:\ntrustd(8)                 BSD System Manager's Manual                trustd(8)\n\nNAME\n     trustd -- Daemon and LaunchAgent that performs trust evaluations\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     trustd\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     trustd provides services for evaluating trust in certificates for all processes on the system.\n\n     This command is not intended to be invoked directly.\n\nBSD                               May 7, 2021                              BSD\n\nWho initiated the changes, or why, I cannot say - I would think you yourself should have a better idea, if you've done any modifications, or which application you've installed, that could have changed the \"group\" file.\nOr maybe somebody else here knows.\nAbout the date: if you look through the system volume, you may find that pretty much all system files have the same modification date (which is new in Big Sur with its boot snapshot).\n", "Q: Drawing a time chart in Numbers 11 I am trying to use numbers to plot a chart of my electricity consumption.\nI have  a table that looks like:\n\n\n\n\ndate\nconsumption\n\n\n\n\n01/01/2021\n10\n\n\n15/01/2021\n110\n\n\n17/01/2021\n140\n\n\n10/02/2021\n180\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see the measurements are not taken at regular intervals (I am nerd but not to that extent).\nIf I try to generate a graph selecting this table I would have something like this:\n\nAs you can see the X axis is regularly spaced: the 4 points are equally distant and one could infer that the consumption is simply linear.\nBy adding in column A all the possible days of the year and in column be the corresponding value, I have this result:\n\nFrom this graph I can detect that there is an acceleration of consumption between the 15th and 17th of January.\nIn other words, the second graph is drawing each point in the right moment in time.\nIs there an option to do this automatically without having to add every single day of the year (or hours, in other use cases) to a column?\nThanks!\n\nA: The format of your dates is not one of the date formats in the US version of Numbers, so the dates are interpreted as arbitrary text values. When you change dates to something universal like 2021-01-10 then the dates are recognized and the distance along the horizontal axis is proportional.\n\nYou may also have to select the date column and explicitly tell Numbers, in the Format>Cell sidebar what the date format is.\nI tell my students this: You will also enjoy using the YYYY-MM-DD date-format because it sorts correctly as mere text, even as numbers, while all other formats do not.\n", "Q: How to enable Force Click on Catalina I like the force click feature to look up the definition of a word but I can't enable it on my system.

In AutoHotKey, using the keyword \"ExitApp\" can allow the user to stop a script with a keypress.  For example, Esc::ExitApp can stop a script by pressing \"esc\".\nNow, with a combination of do shell script (using a bash function like read) and on idle and then calling exit somehow, I thought this was possible in AppleScript.  However, inside of an Automator function, you can't save an AppleScript as \"stay open\" - pasting the on idle thing underneath on run only loops through idle once without providing opportunities for listening for keypresses.  Any ideas?\nExample:  Let's say I have this script in an automator workflow:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set i to 0\n     repeat while i < 100\n       keystroke \"a\"\n       set i to i + 1\n       delay 5\n     end repeat\nend run\n\n\nA: I’m not quite sure if my solution will help you or not.\nI have a whole bunch of different AppleScripts attached to folders by use of Folder Actions and I also run AppleScripts directly from the Script Menu in the menu bar.\nOccasionally one of my AppleScripts decides to misbehave and freezes or gets stuck and trying to quit the running AppleScript from the spinning gear in the menu bar does not work either.\nMy solution in these circumstances is to run this following AppleScript code.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set pidList to unix id of application processes whose name is \"osascript\"\nend tell\n\nset text item delimiters to space\ndo shell script ({\"kill -9\", pidList} as text)\nset text item delimiters to \"\"\n\nI saved the AppleScript code as a .scpt file and run it using Voice Commands, but you can just as easily use the code in a new Automator Quick Action then assign it a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.\n\nNOTE: One of the drawbacks of this solution is that if you are running several scripts at the same time, this will force quit each one. As far as I know, there is no way of knowing which osascript belongs to which running AppleScript. (Not knowing which is which forces me to force quit each one.)\nAgain, I don’t know if any of this will help you or not.  If nothing else maybe it will help spark some ideas for you.\n", "Q: Restore Messages using Time Machine (not iCloud synced) I've made a stupid misclick and deleted 4 years worth of Messages conversation with my significant other. They're not synced to iCloud, but I do have a recent Time Machine backup. I thought I could restore it from there, and I followed older how-to's (older because they are about iMessages, and I am using Messages on Big Sur).\nWhat I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*close Messages\n\n*restore the whole Library/Messages folder from Time Machine\n\n*reopen Messages\n\nNot only did it not work, but it screwed up absolutely all conversations as well. Now, every time I click on a contact's conversation, it disappears. It's like they're in cache, but it can't find them in the database when it tries to load them in full.\nSo: how do I restore my Messages database from a Time Machine backup?\n\nA: OK I've tried a few different things, and I've got something that works. There are two key points:\n\n*\n\n*You need to restore the whole Library/Messages folder (not just chat.db, as is said in most how-to's)\n\n*Before you do this, you need to close Message. But also, after you restore, you need to reboot the Mac.\n\nDoing all of these things (close, restore whole folder, reboot) means that when you restart and open Messages, your backed-up version is present and functional.\nPhew!\n", "Q: Shortcut keys to delete all text to end of line (or all text after cursor)? Edit: This question was marked as duplicate and closed, but I checked the suggested duplicates before asking mine and found they had different particulars, even if they were about the same topic.

One example filename for me is 00aabeab60f635dc810b27b8b884e90115caef61. All characters would be hex digits.\nIn iTunes Preferences under Devices you can see the individual backups, if any. Selecting one, then right-clicking will pop up a menu with the choice \"Show in Finder\".

So if you're not sure if there are any files there, go ahead and run it just in case.)\nConcerning the lost firmware password: on modern Macs, there's no way to reset or bypass this without Apple's help, and it's going to limit what you can do with the Mac until you get it fixed. I'd recommend getting in touch with either Apple or an Apple-Authorized Service Provider about having it reset.

I'm seeing apps, through my own iPhone/iPad, that I'd like to get on to my son's iPad. I'd just like to somehow beam them over there, or download on my device and share with his. Is there a way to do this?\nI don't need to become the sole buyer of apps on his and his mother's devices again, like my understanding of Purchase Sharing.\nI set up Family Sharing a while ago. There's me, my son and my partner. It's pretty locked-down for the child.\nInitially, I set up Purchase Sharing, but I undid that when I realised it simply made me the sole purchaser for apps bought by both him and his mother. That wasn't necessary. Instead, I set up a family bank card against the child's account and required permission for all purchases.\n\nA: As you know, one of the benefits of Family Sharing is that one person (the Organiser) can take responsibility for purchases of all apps, books, music, etc. on family devices even when the users of those devices have their own Apple ID allowing contacts, messaging, etc. to be kept separate from those of the Organiser.\nThat is the method you should be using even if there are some frustrations.  You could just add your son's account to the 'family' leaving your partner to manage her own purchases (if that is appropriate for your family).\nYou can't just transfer/share an app from your Apple ID to another Apple ID. That would be open to abuse. Family sharing was introduced to satisfy your needs whilst allowing Apple to maintain control of the use of purchases.\n", "Q: How to play an mp3 on an iPhone without installing anything?

But you will need to pay if you want to recover any of the files it finds.\n\nA: Sorry not to have answered earlier, but only now I saw the question.\nFirst off - you didn't have to extract the hard-drive from the old Mac to access it. Every Mac I know has a \"Target Disk Mode\" meaning, you boot the Mac while holding the \"T\" on the keyboard, and the Mac becomes.... an external hard drive! you can then connect it to any other Mac and access it.\nNext, since you do experience problems with this hard drive (can't boot) there's good chance it is malfunctioning at some level - maybe just a few bad sectors, maybe it's on the verge of dying, maybe already dead. In any case - it is not wise to use any disk-fixing utility or actually any program that may attempt to change anything on the drive.\nThere are two things I would do:\n\n*\n\n*First, find some good S.M.A.R.T status utility that can query the\ndrive and provide detailed information about its hardware state\n(e.g. Volitans\nhttps://www.volitans-software.com/apps/smart-utility/)\n\n*Find a good non-destructive disk recovery program (I'm addicted to the old \"DiskWarrior\"  from https://www.alsoft.com) which reconstructs a drive all in RAM, mounts it for you on your desktop so you can play with the pseudo hard-drive and copy whatever you can to a good backup drive, and only then - it can attempt to fix the original.\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: I'm going to go out on a limb and try to answer the question that you may be thinking but not asking directly: Is there any way to recover my non-functional hard drive and/or computer?\nA: Yes, you are in luck there are several options.\n\n*\n\n*First, if your computer is completely failing to start, even in (normal) Recovery Mode, it's very likely that you have an NVRAM issue and fortunately this is super easy to fix by resetting the NVRAM. Here are the steps from Apple's official support docs:\n\n\nShut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.\n\n*\n\n*On Mac computers that play a startup sound, you can release the keys after the second startup sound.\n\n*On Mac computers that have the Apple T2 Security Chip, you can release the keys after the Apple logo appears and disappears for the second time.\n\n\nPlease visit this support page for more details: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063\n\n\n*If reseting the NVRAM didn't help, and you are not able to use the normal Recovery Mode (as you mentioned in your question), you have another option: Mac computers have something called Internet Recovery Mode. This mode downloads a recovery OS from the internet and allows you to run basic operations on your computer. After booting into Internet Recovery Mode, you can use the native macOS/OSX Disk Utility app to try to correct whatever software issues your disk may have.\n\n\nTo manually start up from Internet Recovery, press and hold either of these key combinations at startup:\n\n*\n\n*Option-Command-R\n\n*Shift-Option-Command-R\n\n\nPlease visit this support page for more details: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\n\n\n*If running Disk Utility in Internet Recovery Mode doesn't solve your issue, then as @Motti Shneor suggested, you can try connecting your mack to another computer using Target Disk mode and copying over your files.\n\n\nConnect the two computers with a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable. On the Mac you want to use as the disk in target disk mode, do one of the following:\n\n*\n\n*If the computer is off, start it up while pressing and holding the T key.\n\n*...\n\n\nPlease visit this support page for more details: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/transfer-files-mac-computers-target-disk-mode-mchlp1443/mac\n\n\n*If Target Disk Mode doesn't work, but you have the option of either using Internet Recovery Mode (or pulling out your hard drive and plugging it in to another computer), there are some great command line tools for recovering data from a corrupted hard drive. Please see my previous answers here and here for details. I've personally used both of these, and they are good for the following use cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first option is a native dd command. This will attempt to copy your entire disk into a mountable disk image file on an external drive. While doing this, it will replace any physically damaged sectors of the hard drive with zeros: This means all of your undamaged data will be fully accessible without any issues on the new disk image.\n\n*The second option is to use PhotoRec (a third party command line tool), which will attempt to bruit-force read all the data from your hard drive and look for specific file types in it. (You can specify the file types you want when you run it.) This is useful in case your boot sector somehow got destroyed leaving your hard drive inaccessible. (Please note though, both of these options require your hard drive to be un-encrypted, and for you to have at least some degree of read capability on it.)\n\n\n\n*Continuing from #4: If your issue really is due to a damaged boot sector, you may not need to spend the many hours it will take to run PhotoRec. Check out this almost-magic guide to try to fix your damaged boot sector using TestDisk (another third party command line tool). (Again this requires your hard drive to not be encrypted and be at least somewhat accessible.)\n\n\n*Lastly, if you reached this far, it's probably because your hard drive was encrypted and you're about to give up hope. Fear not, you still have 2 more options! First, when you encrypted your drive, Apple would have given you a prompt asking if you wanted them to save your encryption key on their server. If you agreed to do this, you might be able to reach out to Apple Support and ask them for help to decrypt your hard drive. Second, if you didn't trust Apple with your encryption key, fear not! It's actually not that hard to decrypt a hard drive. While I haven't done this myself, I knew someone who had, and apparently it's not that hard to find tutorials on it. (As a personal example, a couple years ago I stumbled on an official tutorial from Intel about how to decrypt a hard drive using one of their tools. So there are articles out there if you've got the patience to find them.)\nClosing remarks:\nIn the first few options above, I gave some keyboard shortcuts to use while trying to boot your computer. You can find a summary of these (and other useful commands) on this Apple support page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255. Quickly glancing over this page, I see a few more options that might be able to help you fix your computer, but I didn't list them in my answer because I have not personally tried them, so feel free to try them out if nothing else helps.\n", "Q: Volume password challenge in Migration Assistant I'm trying to migrate a user account from an old MacBook Pro to a recent, two-year-old iMac.\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro, Mid-2010, High Sierra\n\n*iMac, High Sierra\n\nI'm able to open Migration Assistant on both devices. The device I'm migrating to sees the source device, it totals up the capacity utilization of the accounts I can migrate from. I choose the account on my source device that I want to migrate.\nWhen I'm ready to go, though, Migration Assistant on the target device gives me a message saying that I must supply a Volume Password for an account that is authorized. I thought this was because my source machine used FileVault. I input the password for that account on the source device, but it wouldn't authorize.\nTherefore, I decrypted my source machine, meaning I turned off the FileVault protection. It took  a couple of days to do that.\nMigration Assistant still gets to a point where it requires a Volume Password. I don't know what it means. I've tried every password used by every account on the source and target devices. I'm still blocked from migration.\n\nA: I resolved the Volume Password issue. I did two things, so I don't know which of the two actions resolved it or if they both played a part together. If you encounter the same Volume Password issue, maybe your scenario will resemble mine and this will help you, too.\n\n*\n\n*The accounts on my target iMac had issues with their iCloud configuration. I reentered the authentication for those iCloud accounts.\n\n*Returning to the Migration Assistant, this time when I ran through the wizard I waited for the source accounts and documents to be identified completely before advancing to the next screen which prompted me to create a password for the administrator account I was migrating. Formerly, I created the password on that screen before the previous screen completed identification of the file sizes to be migrated, while going back and forth between the two screens until the file sizes were calculated completely.\n\nThis time, I waited until the file size calculation was complete before advancing to the next screen for creating a password for the administrator account I was migrating.\nThe next screen is where, formerly, Migration Assistant challenged me for a Volume Password. This time, the prompt didn't refer to a \"Volume Password,\" but instead said it needed authentication for an account authorized to create a new user. I realized this meant an account on the target machine. That must have been what it was trying to do at this point before. I still don't know why it didn't work in the former case, because I know that all the passwords I tried included those target machine accounts, too, and they didn't work. This time, instead of challenging for a Volume Password, the screen identified for me the name of an administrator account on the target machine.\nI supplied that account's password and the migration began.\nSo, it works now. As an extra reward for surmounting this surreal problem, while I was fixing my iCloud synchronizations I got the attached error message. Mind you, there is only one iMac on my network. The source for my migration is a MacBook Pro.\nThis is a perfect OSX koan and it is my single favorite error message ever.\n\n\nA: If you have an external disk available, you can make a clone from the 2010 MBP then plug this external disk to the iMac and request the migration of the account from it. Carbon Copy Cloner create Clones very well and the trial version is free for 1 month and fully operational.\n", "Q: Add a Service to an Application, not General I have a script that I'd like to show up in the Services menu of the QuickTime app.\nI already know how to make scripts show up in the \"General\" section of Services, which makes them available in every app.  And know macOS comes with categories of Services in System Preferences.\nIs there a way to assign a custom script to a single application?\n\nA: To have an Automator Service/Quick Action show up in only a given application's Services menu, then in this case set, e.g.:\nWorkflow receives [Automatic (Nothing)] in [QuickTime Player]\n      Note that [Automatic (Nothing)] is the default and can be changed as appropriate.\nWhen setting in [QuickTime Player] the Automator Service/Quick Action will only appear in the Services menu of QuickTime Player, although it will show under General: in the application's Services menu.\nIt this case it will also show under General in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nAs you can see in the pictures below, Say Foobar shows on the Services menu of QuickTime Player, but not Safari.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to move home controls in control center? I enabled home controls in control center. I have 6 favorites that display in control center. However, I use them less frequently than the custom control center items that appear below them (just off screen on a second gen iPhone SE). It's really annoying to have to scroll to turn on the flashlight, which I use all the time.\nIs there any way to either:\n\n*\n\n*move the home controls to the bottom?\n\n*Add alternative home controls (like via Siri shortcut or something) amongst the custom items below (i.e. with the official \"home controls disabled\")?\n\n*At least show only 1 row of home controls (like the big button and 2 favorites) or will a second row be filled in with frequent items?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*There is no way to move the buttons resulting from the \"Show Home Controls\" toggle to a different location.\n\n*There is no way to add custom home-related buttons other than a single home button.  That single home button can be placed anywhere among the custom-added buttons and opens a sub-control-center-view, defaulting to your home favorites.\n\n*There is no way to specify the selection and ordering of the frequently used home controls resulting from the \"Show Home Controls\" toggle\n\nSo the best you can do is disable the \"Show Home Controls\" toggle and add the custom home button, placing it where you want among the custom-added buttons.\n", "Q: What could trigger low *data* mode on a iPhone besides the manual switch? Something is enabling low data mode on wifi on my iPhone(s) from time to time. I usually only notice when I see apps not updating or when I install or want to update an app. It then asks \"Are you sure because of xx MB?\".\nI use (automated) shortcuts in my daily life, but low data mode isn't even an option via shortcuts, only low power mode, which does not trigger low data mode switch inside the wifi profile. My shortcuts do control airplane mode and wifi switch, but I am at loss how any combo's of that could result in low data mode.\nQv1: Does anyone have any idea what could enable wifi low data mode (besides the manual switch inside a wifi profile)?\nAdditional remarks:\n\n*\n\n*low data mode is also a switch somewhere under mobile data, this question is not about that switch; only the wifi variant.)\n\n*low power mode is not active when I encounter this state so the battery icon is green.\n\nAdditional remarks added after comments and time:\n\n*\n\n*Wifi profiles are synced accross devices, iPhones and Macs. (Thanks jksoegaard.)\n\n*I disabled the checkbox 'Connect automatically...' for most Wifi networks inside the Mac settings because I do not want the Mac connecting to Wifi networks automatically. (It is connected via Cable.)\n\n*Due to unclear circumstances I had to uncheck all the checkboxes again, it seemed to have forgotten my preferences.\n\n*Later on, I encountered my phone in low data mode again.\n\nThe evolved question:\nIf there is a true causality, I don't know for sure; might be a coincidence. I can only guess on what caused the Mac (wifi) setting's amnesia, so I cannot reproduce it.\nQv2: Could you somehow unintentionally cause low data mode (inside wifi profiles) on your iPhone by changing settings on your Mac related to the same wifi profile?\n(Low data mode does not exist on MacOS wifi profile as far as I know.)\n\nA: In regards to my comment, triggering off low data mode for Wifi.\n\nWifi Low Data Mode\n\nTo turn off WiFi low data mode regarding your Wifi connection, instead of cellular low data mode. This should not interfere when you change your cellular connection to low data mode.\n\n*\n\n*Step 1: Open Settings and go to Wi-Fi.\n\n*Step 2: Tap the name of your WiFi network.\n\n*Step 3: Enable or Disable Low Data Mode\n\nSuggestions: Update to the latest operating system, as well.\n\nYou might also notice that sometimes applications will not be allowed to refresh their data in the background, and FaceTime calls as an example are not the same quality as they normally would be. The same goes for streaming video, as well.\n\nEnable Or Disable Low Data Mode For Celluar\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 1: Open the Settings app and go to Cellular Data > Cellular Data Options.\n\n\n*Step 2: Enable or Disable Low Data Mode.\n\n\n*Step 3: Might be Celluar Roaming\n\nA: As far as I know, there's nothing in standard iOS that automatically changes this setting.\nHowever, there's a few pit falls you might have run into instead:\n\n*\n\n*The setting is synchronised across your devices using iCloud. This means that if you enable Low Data Mode for a specific WiFi network on your iPad, this setting is then automatically enabled on your iPhone. Perhaps a family member is changing this setting on another iOS device which triggers a change on your iPhone - lots of confusion.\n\n\n*The setting is automatically enabled when connecting to Personal Hotspots. This means that if the WiFi network you're connecting to is not for example a home router or an office network, but instead an iPad or iPhone that is sharing its internet connection, then Low Data Mode will automatically be enabled every time you connect.\n\n\n*You might have multiple SSIDs (network names) for your home network, and you're only changing the setting on one them - creating confusion. For example if you have separate SSIDs for 2.4 Ghz and 5 GHz, or separate SSIDs for a guest network or even separate access points in your home, you should be aware that changing the Low Data Mode setting only changes it for that specific SSID. If you later connect to a different SSID on the same network, you'll need to make the change again.\nUPDATE: You have since updated your question to basically ask a different question:\nThere's no setting in the macOS GUI for Low Data Mode. There's no way to set this from System Preferences or any other built-in GUI tool or command line tool.\nThis means that it is extremely unlikely that you could turn on Low Data Mode for a WiFi network simply by changing a settings for the WiFi network on the Mac.\nHowever, it does not mean that it is fully impossible. If it did indeed happen, it would indicate a bug in Apple's software where somehow changing an unrelated setting makes macOS synchronize a Low Data Mode setting for the network, which your other devices would then pick up.\n", "Q: Is there a way to reverse changes done to a txt file in Documents by Readdle? I wanted to open a txt file on my iPhone/iOS. When I clicked the file in iOS file app, it opened up in Documents app automatically. I then before I knew it managed to overwrite some codes/passwords I had saved in the txt file. Stuff I cannot remember. I then closed the documents app and thought no harm done, as I can just open the txt file and repeat the previous procedure. But when I clicked to open it, and it automatically opened up in documents app, the changes were still there, as it apparently saved all changes done. And now I can't seem to find any option to reverse and open up the original version of the txt file, before I accidentally changed a few passwords.\nI mean, open up a document and writing something, and no option to go back to original, nor any option to make changes reverse. Kinda stupid. The app apparently saves any changes done and that's it. But there got to be a way to reverse the action somehow?\n\nA: Generally, file management applications have the ability to handle any type of file.\nFrom the iCloud drive, for instance, you can make it open the specific file in a specific application by holding your finger on the file icon you desire to open. You then select and by selecting the \"More...\" option from the menu that will hopefully appear, and then selecting \"Share Item... \" and finally selecting an application from the list.\nReversing the actions might be undone by simply opening back to the default application it was made to be opened with.\nA similar question was answered here, you might need a specific application to handle text files.\nReference:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7652455\n", "Q: Does any macOS email client besides Outlook allow use of public shared folders in Exchange?

I stopped the recording after the session ended (with the setting set to save to Desktop), clicked the icon that appeared on the lower right corner to open the file, and played back a few minutes to make sure it worked.\nI then clicked Share to send it via AirDrop to my computer, which did not work; the status remained \"cancelled\" despite my efforts. I assumed I'd be able to access it through my phone by sending it through a third app, so I pressed cancel on the AirDrop pop-up window.\nThe entire screen recording closed and (apparently) vanished forever after the action. I'm extremely frustrated because I can't seem to locate this video.\n\nA: Check ~/Library/ScreenRecordings/ (the Library folder in your home directory).\n\nA: This would be so much more useful if I could take a picture of taking a picture, but it seems Apple doesn't allow that.\nIf you go to System Preferences, Keyboard, Screenshots and note the key sequence for Screenshot and recording options, you can use that to record the monitor or portion of the screen, and specify where to save it. Options (which see) include saving to Desktop, Documents, Clipboard, Mail, Messages, Preview, and Other Location…. I suspect you saved your first recording to the clipboard, and the second to the Desktop, but I have no idea how you changed the destination between recordings.\n\nA: It's probably Dropbox. I had the same problem a while ago, even with screen capture set to save files on my Desktop, they always ended up in a Screenshots folder within Dropbox.

Based on the answer, I should be able to determine a method by which proper screen can be obtained.\n\nA: The Mac mini models, that support up to 3 displays, normally use one of the USB-C ports for the display with the initial Apple logo. The HDMI port would only be used for the initial Apple logo display when there are no USB-C port connected displays. I can only assume that if three displays were connected, then the same USB-C port connected display would always be the initial Apple logo display.

I got the commands from this medium.com post but it's only supposed to change the tab color.  I have removed them now, but tabs are blah.  Better than the line spacing.\n\nA: echo automatically adds a newline to the end of what it prints; since the escape sequence it's printing doesn't actually display anything on screen, this has the effect of printing a blank line. One option is to add the -n option to echo to tell it not to print the newline, but for complicated reasons some versions of echo will just print \"-n\" as part of their output (and then go ahead and print the newline too). printf is much more reliable for things like this (though it can be more complex to use correctly). See \"Why is printf better than echo?\" on the Unix & Linux stackexchange.\nIn this case, you can just replace echo -e with printf, and it should do the same thing but without the unwanted newlines:\nprintf \"\\033]6;1;bg;red;brightness;18\\a\"\nprintf \"\\033]6;1;bg;green;brightness;26\\a\"\nprintf \"\\033]6;1;bg;blue;brightness;33\\a\"\n\n\nA: Comment out or remove the following three lines from ~/.zshrc\n#echo -e \"\\033]6;1;bg;red;brightness;18\\a\"\n#echo -e \"\\033]6;1;bg;green;brightness;26\\a\"\n#echo -e \"\\033]6;1;bg;blue;brightness;33\\a\"\n\nEach echo actually creates a new line (on BigSur 11.2.3) and together they create 3 new lines on every new window/tab.\n", "Q: Can I charge an iPhone XS from my Macbook Pro 2015 when my MBP is running on battery?

When I boot it up, it shows a grey screen with a question mark on a folder.\nI have figured out that the issue is with the internal SSD as I can boot from a USB installer with Mojave just fine. I can see the internal disk with diskutil and also see /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/ from the terminal. I was able to recover the few files this way that I hadn't backed up earlier. However this was too slow as even an ls command on the Macintosh HD Volume takes a couple of minutes to execute and the system.log in /var/log shows loads of error messages of this type: Kernel[0]: disk1: I/O error.

If you are an Objective-C programmer and have Xcode you could roll-your-own app to update the file and what's cached in memory. Sans that, here is a method using a third-party command line utility, shortcuts, and a shell script that works for me.\nThe bash shell script I've written uses the shortcuts binary executable to backup, delete and restore the Text Substitutions. The backup and restore are simple and straight forward compared to deleting the Text Substitutions as shortcuts can only delete one shortcut at a time. It's relatively quick. I have 200+ items in my Replace | With list and the script takes ~4 seconds to delete them, and a fraction of a second to restore them.\nThis was tested under macOS Catalina and macOS Big Sur with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate setting in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\n\nNote: First make a manual backup of your Text Substitutions by going to System Preferences > Keyboard > Text, pressing ⌘A to highlight all entries of Replace | With list, then click-hold with the mouse, then drag and drop to the Desktop, or any folder of a Finder window.\nThis will create a file named Text Substitutions.plist that can be dragged and dropped onto the Replace | With list in System Preferences > Keyboard > Text to manually restore.\nThe example shell script code in conjunction with the shortcuts command line utility does it own backup and restores from its backup, but always make the manual backup described above just to have if ever needed.\n\nInstall shortcuts by one of the methods mentioned in the link.\nI downloaded the source code, reviewed and verified there was nothing ominous in the code, then built it using Xcode.\nIt's also available thru Homebrew, in Terminal brew install rodionovd/taps/shortcuts, or download as a pre-built binary.\n\nNote: The following instructions and example shell script code are for use as an executable shell script in Terminal, and or can be used in a Run Shell Script action in an Automator Service/Quick Action and assigned a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nI'd suggest testing as an executable shell script first to ensure that it works for you, then use the example shell script code in an Automator Service/Quick Action.\nIn Terminal, run the following compound command:\n      Assumes the pwd is your HOME directory.\nf=trw; touch \"$f\"; open -e \"$f\"; chmod +x \"$f\"\n\n      Note: trw = Toggle Replace With (Had to name it something.)\nIn the opened trw document copy and paste the example shell script code into it, then save and close it.\nBack in Terminal:\n./trw\n\nWill toggle the state of the Text Substitutions.\nNote: After testing, move trw to a directory defined in the PATH to be available without typing: ./\n\nExample shell script code:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# set -e\n# set -x \n\nshortcuts=\"/usr/local/bin/shortcuts\"\nautomator=false # true or false\n\n\nmessage() {\n    [ \"${1}\" == \"xmissing\" ] && msg=\" The 'shortcuts' executable is missing!\"\n    [ \"${1}\" == \"already\" ] && msg=\" The text substitutions deletion is already in progress!\"\n    [ \"${1}\" == \"backedup\" ] && msg=\" The text substitutions have been backed up.\"\n    [ \"${1}\" == \"nobackup\" ] && msg=\" No text substitutions to backup or restore!\"\n    [ \"${1}\" == \"restored\" ] && msg=\" The text substitutions have been restored.\"\n    [ \"${1}\" == \"deleting\" ] && msg=\" The text substitutions deletion is in progress...\"\n    [ \"${1}\" == \"finished\" ] && msg=\" The text substitutions deletion has completed.\"\n    [ $automator == false ] && printf '%s\\n' \"${msg}\"\n    [ $automator == true ] && printf '%s\\n' \"$(date -j) ${msg}\" >> message.txt\n    [ $automator == true ] && [ -n \"${2}\" ] && \\\n    osascript -e \"display notification \\\"${msg}\\\" with title \\\"Toggle Replace With\\\"\"\n}\n\nbackupdir=\"$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.$USER.shortcuts\"\n[ !

It is coded like this as /usr/local/bin/ is not in the PATH passed to a Run Shell Script action in an Automator Service/Quick Action.\nThe first time the shell script is run it creates a backup of the Text Substitutions to restore from, so it is imperative that there actually be some text substitutions to backup! A current backup is made each time prior to deleting them from the ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist file and is restored from the last backup.\nThe reason a third-party application is being used is in this use case it does something that the macOS default utilities cannot do, which is dynamically update the changes to the system. In other words, the defaults command as well as the /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy command in this use case does not update the system to the changes and has the same issue as swapping out the ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist file.\nWhen using the example shell script code in a Run Shell Script action in an Automator Service/Quick Action, you need to set automator=true in the line after, e.g., shortcuts=\"/usr/local/bin/shortcuts\"\nBackups are saved to:\n$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.$USER.shortcuts/Text_Substitutions.plist\n\nThe example shell script code when run as an executable shell script outputs messages to stdout and you see them as you go, however, when used in a Run Shell Script action in an Automator Service/Quick Action messages are displayed in Notification Center and also log to:\n/private/tmp/com.$USER.shortcuts/message.txt\n\nI will try you add comments to the code and or add additional notes here in the next couple of days.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer Note: The example shell script code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any additional error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted.\n\nA: TextView windows that use macOS's Text Replacement usually provide a menu item to toggle Text Substitution off and on.\nEdit > Substitutions > Text Replacement\n\nYou can set a keyboard shortcut for this menu item in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts.\n\n(Here I've done it just for TextEdit, but you can do it for All Applications if you want.)\nToggling the key command gives me the following, when I type omw:\n\nThis achieves your goal of switching the replacement status without the complicated effort of maintaining and switching two complete preference files.\n", "Q: How to view the quota limits of an APFS volume that I had set at the time of its creation?

Periodically Time Machine verifies sparsebundle backups with fsck_hfs. When the sparsebundle is on a Time Capsule (TC) it does this by creating a partial and much smaller representation of the sparsebundle on the TC, transferring the result to the mac into\n/private/var/db/com.apple.backupd.backupVerification \n\nand then running fsck_hfs on it locally (it mounts the local sparsebundle as can be seen with diskutil list).\nThe problem is that it takes a very long time for fsck_hfs to verify this representation of very large TC sparsebundles (e.g. >24hrs).\n[This leaves the timemachine process showing in the menu as if it was stuck 'verifying' with the real Time Capsule disk apparently no longer mounted under /Volumes - which confuses many into thinking the process has died]\nfsck_hfs is launched by its parent process backupd with the parameters -f -n -x -E . There are various posts about fsck_hfs working much more efficiently if allowed to use more memory (-c option). By default (at least on my system) it seems to be limited to 3Gb.\nMy question is, is there anyway to pass a config that might cause backupd to launch fsck_hfs with the additional (-c) parameter and so run faster?\n\nA: As far as I know, there's no configuration file or GUI part of the setup that you can use to force Time Machine to let fsck_hfs use more than the default amount of RAM for caching.\nThere's however a kind of \"workaround\" for making this work anyway. You replace /sbin/fsck_hfs with a new program (script or binary) that checks if it is run by Time Machine, and if so adds \"-c 8G\" (or whatever you want) to the command line parameters given to fsck_hfs. If it not run by Time Machine, just run fsck_hfs with the given parameters.\nIf you're on a recent macOS, you'll need to disable SIP in order to replace fsck_hfs.\n", "Q: Finding which files the migration assistant failed to transfer I ran a transfer of about 4 TB of files from my failing Mac to my new Mac.

Is this safe to use?\nIf not, which is the correct cable to use for this Mac?\nEdit: on the plug it says 10A, 250V AC\n\nA: If it needs 110v then you need a power transformer, not just a kettle plug.\nThe plug known as a kettle plug often isn't one…\nSee the list of power couplers on WIkipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320#Appliance_couplers - a 'kettle plug' is actually a high-temperature [C15] version of the more common IEC C13 plug.\nYou can buy IEC 13s just about anywhere - & many people have spares from old computers etc still kicking around in drawers.\nThe C15 has a notch to prevent plugging a 'low temperature' C13 into it. Plugging the other way, a high temp C15 into a low temp C14 appliance is no issue.\nYour issue isn't the plug, it's the voltage.\nIf you plug a 110v Mac into a 240v supply, you will kill it, stone dead.\nIf you can get a photo of the appliance rating sticker on the back, then we can be more certain.\nModern computing/electronics has universal voltage, anything from 100v to 250v would be fine.

Sense1 is only to inform the card whether a 6 or 8 pin plug is plugged in.\nI think the big difference in your usage is that 8-pin plugs are able to pull 150 W, where 6-pin plugs only provide 75 W at max.\nAs far as I see the Sapphire HD 7950 needs 80 W at idle.\nSo I see 3 Possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*Buy a 6 to 8 Pin Cable and risk your power supply (amazon link) (worst idea)\n\n*Use the card with only 150 W max (75W from PCI Power Supply + 75 W directly of the mainboard)\n\n*Get another Power Supply\n\n\nA: Well, in the end it came down to \"what works\"…\nUsing two 6-pin cables, Apple standard as supplied with the machine from new, it simply refused to register to the PCI bus at all. It would light & the fans would spin, the machine would start up but register nothing in the PCI at all. I could test this by remoting into it with Apple RDC.\nI got a couple of 6 to 8-pin cable converters, 4 quid[bucks/euros] for three with next day delivery on Amazon Prime [they were cheaper than buying just two] & it immediately works as advertised, right from the boot screen.\nSlight update - well, for some reason it would hang the first Mac after a few hours, so I moved the card to my other. Now works fine. Older 6-pin 7950 moved to the first Mac.\nI wonder if there's a difference in the PSU spec. Crashy Mac is a 'real' 5,1 3.33GHz 6-core. Stable Mac is a 4,1 with firmware upgrade, 3.46GHz 12-core. Maybe the dual CPU required a heftier PSU?\nAnyway. Done. Next, Mojave… then who knows, Big Sur, now this is a spare 'experimantal' machine ;)\n", "Q: AppleID Two-factor Authentification with Email address Suppose I have 2FA activated for AppleID, and I lose my phone and I need to log in with my AppleID. This becomes further complicated when I travel to another country and have to use another, local phone number for some time.\nI wish I could use my email-address for 2FA instead of my phone number.\nIs there any way I can log in with my AppleID if I don't have access to my phone number?\n\nA: Yes, you can login with your AppleID using any trusted device without having access to your phone number.\nThe first time you login with your AppleID using an iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch or Mac, you'll be asked if you want to trust the device. This saves data on the device that allows you to login again without having to your phone number at all.\nWhen you need to login with your AppleID you can use any of the trusted devices to generate the necessary six-digit verification code. So if you're logging on to a new, untrusted device, you can use the code shown on your Mac, iPad or another device as verification. You do not have to use your phone number at all.\nThe trusted phone number is only used if you cannot access of your trusted devices. You can potentially use a VoIP phone number as the trusted phone number (make sure to check that the specific VoIP service works for this purpose), if you having problem carrying your ordinary number with you when you travel. However, normally it is not problem taking your cell phone and phone services to other countries.\nRegarding your frustration with \"why not email\": Only Apple can really know why Apple did what Apple did. However, the point of 2-factor authentication is to ensure that two different factors are used when authentication - these factors are commonly named \"something you know\", \"something you have\" and \"something you are\".\nFor many people their email-account will be behind the same username and password as the AppleID they want to protect with 2FA - therefore using email is not a good idea there. In addition, quite a few will have their email protected by only a username and a password - which similar to your AppleID username and password is \"something you know\" - which means that you then only have 1-factor authentication.\nYou could easily argue that Apple should support other methods for the second factor - such as for example TOTP tokens. However, we cannot know why Apple has chosen not to do so. It is really speculation at that point.\n\nA: Keep in mind SMS is a fallback from trusted device push notifications. You don’t even need an SMS message unless you can not / do not choose to have trusted devices with you that use network based Apple push notification services (APNS).\n\n*\n\n*Go all in on trusted devices if you can - avoid SMS entirely.\n\n*Choose a dual sim phone if you can so you can layer both lines when you travel or add a short term number.\n\n*Many carriers allow SMS to forward to a watch or iPad or computer so that the delivery is network based like the Apple trusted device notification path.\n\n*Add your new number as a trusted phone number when you need that extra flexibility.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915\nYou don’t have to remove your primary or depend on SMS only would be my recommendation unless/until Apple adds new methods of verifying it’s you when you want to sign in to a service from abroad.\n", "Q: Read/write raw NFC data on a mac I'm looking for a solution to read/write raw data from and to mifare classic tags.

NDEF Apps like e.g. NFC Tools for Desktop are no use to me, because they only support reading/writing NDEF records but not raw data.\n\nA: For programming your own macOS application, you have multiple options. As you mention Android, you might want to go the Catalyst way in order to create an app for both iOS and macOS at the same time. In that case, you want to use the Core NFC framework from Apple to access the NFC reader.\nIf you want really raw access without a framework, you'll want to start from a specific set of hardware. For example a popular choice is the ACR122U NFC reader/writer, which is connected through USB. It comes with Mac software, which might be enough for your needs - and if not, it can be programmed at the lowest level if need be. You can read the details in the API documentation.\nAnother option is to install pcsc-lite from HomeBrew and use their implementation as a stepping stone in creating your own implementation.\n", "Q: Upgrading early 2015 Macbook pro from Mojave to Catalina/Big Sur?

I would like to know if I could selectively erase some backups, for example all backups of Folder X in the last 2 weeks, and still be assured the following (future) backups of this Folder X will be correct.\nCould it be as simple as mounting the hard disk of the backup, go to the targeted folders and thrashing them ?\nThe objective is obviously to reclaim space.\nI'm on an iMac 2019, Big Sur 11.3.1.\nEdit: following some remarks, I looked again in the interface and I found a \"delete backup\" option, by right-clicking on a file or folder.\nWhat is strange is that there are inconsistencies. Sometimes the option disappears. Then comes back. I am quite confused. Maybe, just a temporary bug while TM updates its indexes.\nAnd I'm also a little embarrassed to ask such a stupid question if the option is right under my eye. I've been using TM since 2007 and did not notice this feature.\nDid anyone use it successfully ? Currently, I can't test it as I disabled TM while I'm working on my 300 GB library\n\nA: You can open Finder and select your backup disk. Find the backups in the time range and delete them (shown in the image below). This will delete those backups on disk. This will properly delete the backups - if you inspect system logs you will find it handling these as requests to delete a backup, rather than as requests to delete a folder.\nI would recommend doing it one at a time to avoid overwhelming the backup disk.\nDeleting a backup will not delete files that were added in that backup from other backups. Each backup can be viewed independently, as a snapshot of your disk at that time.\n\n\nA: You could try excluding the folder from the backup, then waiting for the next backup, at which time the folder's contents should be deleted from the backup.\nThen remove the exclusion.\nThats not quite what you're asking, but will have the same effect of reducing space from multiple copies of that folder.\n", "Q: Archiving emails locally outside of Apple Mail/Server I'm migrating from two very old (the oldest from 2004) Gmail accounts to one iCloud Mail. Unfortunately both accounts have, together, around 30k uncategorised emails in their inbox, from which probably at least 70% could be deleted.\nMy goal is to have those email accounts completely empty and clean, and check them every once in a while in case something important (old acquaintance, etc.) pops up, or in case I use a service linked to that account (which I would change to my new email).\nI gave up the idea of going through all 30k emails and picking up things that I might want to keep.

It's just a hard drive connected to my router.\nI started doing Time Machine backups to this disk rather recently and until several days ago backups were done without any problems. But now Time Machine complains about incorrect credentials (based on what it tells me) and for some reason no backups are found on this disk anymore.\nI tried to add and remove the storage many times and run a few commands with tmutil but without a deep understanding how it works it's hard to fix anything or even find out the cause of the problem...\nThis is what it looks like:\n\n*\n\n*I start with a pristine and uninitialized Time Machine screen and there I select the NAS storage.\n\n\n*It asks me to provide credentials for the NAS storage.\n\n\n*After entering the correct credentials it says that there is an existing encrypted backup already and asks me if I want to use it or start over:\n\n\n\n*After I click on Use Existing Backup button it asks me to provide a password for my existing backup, and that's where things become interesting...

Whenever I try to open the .sparsebundle file on that disk (even when it is connected directly to my MacBook) it is mounted successfully and I can browse all snapshots without even typing the encryption password (which I find particularly weird because KeyChain on my MacBook does not contain any keys which are related to the backups - I removed everything intentionally to check if that will work).\nAnd this is what happens when I try to run most of the commands with tmutil:\n ~ % tmutil machinedirectory\n No machine directory found for host.\n\n ~ % tmutil latestbackup\n Unable to locate machine directory for host.\n\nAny suggestions?\nUPD:\nI figured out why my Time Machine sparsebundle didn't require password. It was saved in KeyChain but under some strange GUID with the suffix/extension \".sparsebundle\". I found it by searching \"disk\". And then after I removed these items completely I need to enter the password every time I access the sparsebundle image.\nAnd... After playing around with tmutil associatedisk I managed to change the behavior of Time Machine. Now, instead of accepting any password and then displaying that there are no backups found, it rejects any password and says that \"Password is invalid\" although the password is obviously correct assuming that I can access the sparsebundle contents directly through Finder.\n\nA: So it seems that the problem is related to my router or one of the recent MacOS upgrades that probably introduced something new or broke compatibility because just weeks ago it worked properly. Just for the record the model of my router is Keenetic Giga.\nHow did I understand it? I created a blank HFS+ partition, connected my HDD to the router and fed it up to Time Machine. I got the same error as described in my question. So it is clear that the cause of the error is not associated with the backup itself.\nSo I decided to migrate all my backups to a new partition on that drive and use it as a local backup storage instead of NAS. And because I had that .sparsebundle file I needed to figure out a way to \"burn\" it (copy its contents) to the new APFS volume. It seemed like an easy task to do but it's really not...\nI'll skip a story with all my tries and failures and move directly to the solution.\nSo to convert a .sparsebundle file to APFS volume there is a feature called \"Restore\" in the Disk Utility. But UI is not much helpful because in general this functionality sucks when it comes to the .sparsebundle format. So we need to arm ourselves with patience and Terminal. And at first we need to mount the \".sparsebundle\" image through Finder and then change metadata of the mounted volume a little:\ndiskutil apfs changeVolumeRole /dev/diskXsY t\nwhere diskXsY - is the identifier of your volume which you can find running diskutil apfs list\n\nThis command will change the role of your volume and MacOS will no longer know that it is a backup storage. Without doing it the next command will fail (due to a bug).\nsudo asr restore --source /Volumes/EXTERNAL_HDD/{the name of your computer}.sparsebundle --noverify  --target /dev/diskAsB --erase  --debug --verbose\nwhere /dev/diskAsB is the identifier of a volume that you want to use as the backup storage. \n--noverify is needed here because there is also another bug in this utility.\n\nAfter you enter a password (if you have an encrypted backup) and agree to erase the volume this command will replicate the contents of your \".sparsebundle\" onto the target volume. It will take a while...\nAfter it finishes you will almost receive a functional (unencrypted) backup storage. To make it fully functional you should run:\ndiskutil apfs changeVolumeRole /dev/diskAsB T\n\nThis command will assign a Backup role to your target volume and Time Machine will recognize it.\nLater you may want to encrypt your storage with \"hdiutil\" (warning: it will take hours to complete).\nAt this stage I configured Time Machine to use the drive as a local backup storage and after doing that one of the folders changed its suffix in the name from .inprogress to .interrupted.\nAt the end of the day Time Machine copied an increment only and it looked like this:\n\n\nAfter the backup process finished I looked into the contents of the drive and found out that Time Machine killed my old backups and during the Cleaning up phase it went from this:\n$ ... % ls\n2021-05-06-201324.previous  2021-05-22-195414.inprogress\n2021-05-06-212814.interrupted   backup_manifest.plist\n\nto this:\n$ ... % ls\n2021-05-22-212814.previous  backup_manifest.plist\n\nI believe that it is due to the interrupted backup which you can see above but I don't want to spend any more time on that. So technically I still didn't get my old backups back and all I got was pain from multiple Apple bugs and inconveniences but at least I have more knowledge now how it is built under the hood and probably this information will be useful for someone who want to convert .sparsebundle to APFS (or to be more concise - to a local backup disk formatted as APFS).\n", "Q: Disk Is Full Error When Copying Large Folders Onto Empty HDD Bought myself a brand new Seagate HDD (formatted in exFAT). I tried copying over a bunch of folders to back up (160 GB worth) and I am met with the below error message. This is strange, because there is absolutely nothing on the HDD. I tried reformatting it to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) thinking it would help since that format is optimized for Mac OS, but unfortunately, I am met with the same error message. How can I get around this? By the way this is on Big Sur.\nIt seems to be an issue with my Macbook itself, since I cannot copy large folders after trying a separate HDD.\n\n\nA: I figured it out! It was a pesky icloud issue. Some files within the gigantic 160GB folder I was trying to transfer were not downloaded to my Mac's internal SSD disk, and instead were stored in icloud. When transferring the files, it appears that icloud must first download the files onto the internal SSD, and then once downloaded it will copy to the external HDD. The issue was that I barely had any space left on my Mac's internal SSD (only 52 mb!), so when I tried copying the large folder onto the external HDD, it would fail to download the files stored in icloud because my SSD only had 52mb left.\nI suppose when the error message says \"The operation can't be completed because the disk is full\", Apple is saying that the disk is the SSD, and that icloud failed to download the files from the cloud before the transfer. Very misleading error message since I definitely thought disk was referring to the external HDD!\n", "Q: My Macbook Pro M1 suddenly isn't showing the correct resolutions anymore I've installed Steam, Parallels and OBS on my Macbook Pro M1, OSX Big Sur 11.3.1.

If not, then you should update your question.\nI also assume here your Mac does not have the T2 chip. If your Mac has the T2 chip, then you have to remove Secure Boot and allow External Boot. Some releases of Ubuntu can not be installed on the internal drive of newer Intel Macs. If this is the case with your Mac, then you will need to install to an USB drive.\nYou can install the rEFInd boot manager if you wish, but consider this. The firmware on the Mac logic board contains a boot loader and boot manager. Ubuntu will by default install Grub, which is also a boot loader and boot manager. (Although in this case, the boot manager will operate silently.) Installing a rEFInd as a third boot manager is not necessary.\n", "Q: Want scan-only virus removal, not real-time I'm running Little Snitch to catch real-time transmissions, but I do want to scan at off-hours for latent problems.\nWhich of the best anti-virus products support scan-only with all real-time checking disabled?\nI was running Sophos but their real-time checking cannot be 100% disabled despite turning it off (they confirmed, and you can see it running non-stop in Activity Monitor, and it was slowing down development).\nThanks.\n\nA: Malwarebytes free version does on-demand only scanning.\n", "Q: can't mount an encrypted Volume on an M1 Mac. Works fine on Intel Macs. Known Issue? Is this a known issue with M1 Macs and encrypted drives?\nWhat steps should I attempt to mount this volume?\nEncrypted drive will not mount on M1 Mac. Mounts on my intel Macs no problems.\nIt’s Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) format and I used Disk Utility to create the volume using standard Apple encryption.\nIt hangs DU when I ask DU to mount the volume, sometimes even just plugging it into the M1 Mac causes DU to hang.\nOn the rare times Finder asks for a password for the volume, it beachballs the Finder/Mac. When I try and mount it using DU or Terminal it doesn’t work, in DU it hangs DU and I have to force quit DU. Apple support senior advisor still cannot get to the bottom of it. Seems to be an M1 Mac and/or Big Sur issue. I’ve already allowed 3rd kernel extensions on this Mac so that’s not it.\nThis is not a Time Machine drive. (people often assume it might be). On the Intel Mac I can connected with a USB3 cable into a USB2 hub (older Mac) or via a OWC TB2 hub in one of the USB ports. ON the 13' M1 MBA I'm going directly into the USB3 port via an adapter (TB3 to USB/HDMI adapter). The M1 Mac can see the drive but not mount it from terminal, disk utilities or in Finder. If I ever get to the point of being able to enter the encryption key, it hangs the app doing it, or the Mac entirely.\n  $ diskutil list external\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *960.2 GB   disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage magic-carpet            959.9 GB   disk2s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3\n\n/dev/disk3 (external, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS magic-carpet           +959.5 GB   disk3\n                                 Logical Volume on disk2s2\n                                 F37357F2-53C0-4926-BC59-431301F9A208\n                                 Unlocked Encrypted\n\n/dev/disk4 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +49.1 MB    disk4\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk4s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS AnyMP4 Screen Record... 49.1 MB    disk4s2\n\n\nA: There's no known, general issue with encrypted drives for the M1 Mac.\nThe symptoms you're describing sound very much like a corrupted file system. Together with bugs in the operating system's file system code, it can lead to these issues. I would run a file system check on the drive when unmounted. You can do this from your Intel Mac.\nYou can run the file system check from the Terminal like this:\nsudo fsck_hfs -f /dev/disk3\n\nNote that this assumes the file system is HFS+ and that it is mounted as /dev/disk3 (as in your screenshot). Use Disk Utility first to find the actual disk number.\nThe problem could also be of a hardware nature. I would suggest trying to connect the disk using the exact same adapter to another PC/Mac and see if that works. As you're using different methods of connecting the disk currently, it is difficult to know if it could be a hardware issue or not.\n", "Q: What is this qemu-system-aarch64 process and why is it using almost 3 GB of RAM on my M1 Mac I am on my M1 Mac mini (Big Sur 11.3.1). I got a message that I am running out of RAM and should close some apps. I saw this process called qemu-system-aarch64 that takes up to 3GB of RAM. I don't know what it does and cannot stop it either. What is it and why does it eat up so much RAM?\n\n\nA: I guess you are a developer and you are using some sort of Android emulator. I too have a Mac, and this process refers to the Android Studio emulator I use for debugging.\n\nA: This process belongs to an application you've installed yourself.\nTo find out more, select the process in Activity Monitor and press Cmd-I to open the Process Information window. You should see the name of the process which started it at the top, and the path to the binary itself near the top of the 3rd tab (open files and ports).\n\nA: It was a Docker for Mac!\nThere is no clear name indication, that this is a Docker so you can't clearly spot it in the Activity Monitor\nStopping Docker releases the resources\nHint : It's possible to see process origin by hitting ⌘+I\nGithub issue :\ngithub.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5812\n\nA: The memory use you are looking at is virtual memory and it typically won't slow down your system. If you are wondering about the memory usage of Docker, enable and check the real memory column.\n", "Q: Running uname -m Gives x86_64 On M1 Mac Mini When I run uname -m in zsh (run via Terminal.app) on my M1 Mac Mini, the output is x86_64, instead of the expected arm64. This is occurring both in zsh and in bash. This is causing issues with installing native ARM wheels with pip, which thinks that I am running an x86 system. I couldn't find any information online about this, and am wondering if it is a bug, or something that I have overlooked. Any ideas of what is going on? Is this expected behavior? I am running macOS 11.3.1. The following other information is output by uname:\nuname: Darwin\nuname -a: Darwin macmini.local 20.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 20.4.0: Thu Apr 22 21:46:41 PDT 2021; root:xnu-7195.101.2~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T8101 x86_64\nuname -p: i386\n\nA: I had a similar problem, which I noticed in attempting to install Homebrew with M1 support. Homebrew's installation script uses uname -m to determine which Homebrew to install, and so was giving me the wrong (Intel) version because it was detecting me as x86_64.\nIt turns out that my problem was described in this comment\n\nit's not just if running Terminal in Rosetta, but also if whatever process runs the script happens to be running in Rosetta too. If someone runs this in a script deployed by, say, an RMM that is running via Rosetta you'll get x86_64\n\nMy problem was that my bash itself was installed by the old Intel Homebrew, and was itself running through Rosetta.\n$ file `which bash`\n/usr/local/bin/bash: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n\nI needed to switch to the system bash by running\n$ chsh -s /bin/bash\n\nand reconfigure my $PATH such that /bin/bash was preferred. Now uname -m always gives me the expected arm64.\n\nA: I can reproduce what you are seeing on our Macs on 11.2.3 and 11.3.1 - we get arm64 / arm / arm64 reliably back despite different shells and homebrew (or lack thereof) setups on each.\nbmike@mini ~ % sw_vers                 \nProductName:    macOS\nProductVersion: 11.3.1\nBuildVersion:   20E241\nbmike@mini ~ % /usr/bin/arch\narm64\nbmike@mini ~ % /usr/bin/uname -p\narm\nbmike@mini ~ % /usr/bin/uname -a\nDarwin mini 20.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 20.4.0: Thu Apr 22 21:46:41 PDT 2021; root:xnu-7195.101.2~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T8101 arm64\n\nChoosing rosetta to run terminal changes this for a stock Mac. Quit and start again terminal.app, and I then get i386 / i386 / x86_64 the same as you reported.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/37723/rosetta-2-extension-attribute\nIf you look below, you'll see it enabled which will launch a shell that reports what you are seeing as opposed to the results \"out of the box\" that I showed above.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem without using Rosetta.\nIt turned out the reason was that I installed homebrew before it had M1 support. Even though I frequently upgrade homebrew, it didn't switch to the Apple Silicon version when it became available.\nReinstalling homebrew solved the issue for me.\n", "Q: In MacBook Terminal login history, does console mean that someone physically logged into my MacBook? In terminal, I used the last command and got the following:\nPaul  console                   Tue May 11 15:46 - 15:49  (00:03)\npaul  console                   Tue May 11 09:17 - 09:18  (00:01)\n\nI wasn’t at my computer at that time. Someone else was using my computer with a different username.

driver :( Apple cant fix it from macos 11.3. https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/678644 Downgrade to 11.2.3 is workaround, but not recommended: this macOS has zero day vunerabilities https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/malware-xcsset-macos/ . Wait fix from apple.\n", "Q: Can't import automator workflow \"document can't be opened\" I found this \"question\" Convert Mac to Windows paths and visa-versa for sharing with colleagues \nWhich lead me over different detours to this github: https://github.com/marcoziti/mactoys\nI downloaded the .workflow files, but unfortunately I can't open them.\nWhen double clicking, nothing is happening. When I start automator and select the file to open it  has a popup: Document \"XY\" can't be opened (I translated the error from german).\nAny idea why this happens? I thought I could just import the script.\nI'm currently running BigSur 11.3.1\n\nA: Those files are not Automator workflows, they are just raw text AppleScripts.\nYou'll need to create your own Automator workflow, and paste those scripts into the Run AppleScript action.\nThe last edit, 3 year ago, was to rename the scripts as .workflow, which is an error.\n", "Q: Is it possible to programmatically (or in machine-readable form) get location data from an AirTag? AirTags seem to be an incredibly useful way of creating a de-facto globally available location tracker, by taking advantage of the sheer number of iOS devices around.\nI'd love to be able to obtain an AirTag and get location data from it (or more precisely from the Apple 'Find My' network) programmatically or in machine-readable form, though. Currently as I understand it the location is only available through the 'Find My' tool (digression: see this fascinating recent article illustrating that), which in effect means it's limited to what's plotted on a map. Can I get lat/long co-ordinates from this? Can I programmatically trigger the request for location? This would be a great way to (for example) plot everywhere I travel, by popping one in my bag and having a central server somewhere request my location periodically and log it. Real-time would be ideal, but even a history of locations would be good.\n(Note: I wasn't sure if this question was better suited for here or StackOverflow. Happy if the community wants to move it).\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to do so via a private API - however it is a bit of a \"hack\" as this is not officially supported by Apple.\nYou can find an open source implementation of using the private API here:\nhttps://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/tree/main/OpenHaystack/OpenHaystackMail\nNote that in order to use the private API, you'll need a specific entitlement for your app that is not available to third parties. This can be worked around by disabling GateKeeper, installing the program linked above as a plugin for Mail, enabling the plugin in Mail, and then re-enabling GateKeeper.\n\nA: You can also have the FindMy app running, and periodically grab the position from the cache from the command-line:\n$ jq -r '.[] | select(.name == \"Storm\") | .location | \"\\(.latitude) \\(.longitude) \\(.timeStamp/1000 | todate)\"' ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.findmy.fmipcore/Items.data\n\n61.84794671778637 11.892693370033092 2022-03-18T09:00:26Z\n\nJust append that output to a file using a cron job or a looping script.  (\"Storm\" is the name of the tag)\nIf Items.data is empty, use Devices.data instead.\nmacOS Monterey is needed for AirTag support in FindMy.app.\n", "Q: Is there a way to create a shortcut in Finder to an Apple Note? I like to use Apple Notes to organize details and checklists for my projects — it's very convenient. However, it would be more convenient if I could access a project note directly from the project folder in Finder. I understand that I can export the note as PDF, but as that I'm constantly adding to and changing my project notes, I'd prefer the shortcut to open the note (or note folder) in the Notes app directly.\nHere's a mockup of what I'd like to accomplish:\n\nI've tried to locate the note in Finder, but Apple stores all the notes together in one file. I was just going to create a shortcut to that note (which is still pretty inconvenient). Ideally I like to change the save location for an individual note, share to finder, or create a shortcut link. Can this be done with AppleScript or Automator, or even a simpler method?\n\nA: I think you will like this following AppleScript solution.\nSTEP 1: Save this following AppleScript code as a Script File to your /Users/YOUR SHORT NAME/Library/Script Libraries/ folder. (with the name “Make Link To Note Library.scpt”).  Just compile the script and save it and don’t even bother running it from Script Editor.\nThis following AppleScript will be used as, what is known as a “Script Library”.\nproperty destinationSuffix : \"Contents/Resources/applet.icns\"\nproperty iconFile : missing value\nproperty thisApp : missing value\nproperty noteName : missing value\n\nif iconFile = missing value then changeMyIconToNotesIcon()\nif noteName = missing value then chooseNote()\n\ntry\n    tell application \"Notes\"\n        activate\n        show note noteName\n    end tell\nend try\n\nto changeMyIconToNotesIcon()\n    set iconFile to path to resource \"AppIcon.icns\" in bundle ¬\n        (path to application \"Notes\")\n    set thisApp to path to me\n    set replaceThisIcon to POSIX path of thisApp & ¬\n        destinationSuffix as string\n    do shell script \"cp \" & quoted form of POSIX path of iconFile & \" \" & ¬\n        quoted form of replaceThisIcon & \" ; touch \" & ¬\n        quoted form of POSIX path of thisApp\nend changeMyIconToNotesIcon\n\non chooseNote()\n    tell application \"Notes\" to set noteNames to name of notes\n    activate\n    set noteName to (choose from list noteNames) as text\n    return noteName\nend chooseNote\n\n\nSTEP 2: Save this following AppleScript code as an application, with the name, for example “NOTES Make Link To Note Template.app”\nproperty loadedScript : load script alias ¬\n    ((path to library folder from user domain as text) & ¬\n        \"Script Libraries:Make Link To Note Library.scpt\")\n\nrun loadedScript\n\n\nTaking this concept one step further, and making life much easier for everyone planning to use the code in my solution. Instead of copying and pasting the code from STEP 2, into a new Script Editor document and saving it as an application etc. , every time you want to create a “Direct Link To A Specific Note” , This following STEP 3 should make the process seamless.\nSTEP 3: Save this following AppleScript code as an application, with the name, for example “Make Link To Note CREATOR droplet.app”\nNow that we’ve created the Script Library file \"Make Link To Note Library. scpt”, from STEP 1’s Instructions, we can access its handlers and their commands, directly in this code by inserting the use command at the top of this following script.  This line set noteName to (notesLibrary's chooseNote()) & \".app” is an example of how to utilize a command from a Script Library file.\nuse notesLibrary : script \"Make Link To Note Library\"\nuse scripting additions\n\non open theFile\n    appletFileIsAcceptable(theFile)\n    \n    activate\n    set saveToFolder to choose folder with prompt ¬\n        \"Save Your New \\\"Link To Note.app\\\" To Which Folder?\" multiple selections allowed false ¬\n        with invisibles and showing package contents\n    \n    set noteName to (notesLibrary's chooseNote()) & \".app\"\n    \n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set duplicatedApp to duplicate item 1 of theFile to saveToFolder\n        set name of duplicatedApp to noteName\n        open (((saveToFolder as text) & noteName) as alias)\n        reveal (((saveToFolder as text) & noteName) as alias)\n    end tell\nend open\n\non appletFileIsAcceptable(theFile)\n    tell application \"System Events\" to if name extension of ¬\n        item 1 of theFile ≠ \"app\" then return -- decide if theFile is acceptable\nend appletFileIsAcceptable\n\nIn Finder, drag your new created Script Editor applet from STEP 2. directly onto the icon of the Droplet from STEP 3. This will create a duplicate of the”Template.app” to a folder of your choosing and name it to the name of the chosen Note and then launch it automatically. When the process is complete, the new “Go To Specific Note.app” will be completely configured and revealed in Finder\n\n\nA: In Notes app, add a collaborator, and share the link with yourself. Copy that iCloud link and open it in a web browser. No need to sign in. We just care about the URL.\n\n\n\n(If you can't share the note due to icon being disabled, see https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/icloud/mmc0cd6c83/icloud)\nIn the address bar, grab the padlock icon and drag and drop it in Finder/ Desktop.\n\n\n\nOpening that .webloc file will open the note in the Notes app.\n\nwebloc file is just a plist:\ncat ~/Desktop/note.webloc:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>URL</key>\n    <string>https://www.icloud.com/notes/UUID_OF_MY_NOTE</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: notes is a valid url protocol. So you can type notes:// into the URL bar of a browser, and it will open Notes.app.\nHowever, I haven't found a way of opening the app to a specific note with a specific URL. Using the UUID from the iCloud.com URL of a note doesn't select a given note. It may be possible, so , yes, a bit of a half-answer.\n", "Q: Stop the message 'A software update is required to connect to your iPad' without doing a software update I'm not interested in updating any software at this point.

Macbook Pro Catalina - iPhone 7+\nI have many old mp3 books on old hard drives. I do not understand the modern iPhone manager. It seems completely subscription oriented.\nHow do I move an old fashioned mp3 file to my iPhone and listen to it, and have it remember where I left off the next day?\n\nA: The first thing you want to do is get your MP3 files into iTunes. So copy those mp3 files to the Mac/PC you sync your iPhone with using iTunes. And drag them into the iTunes window to add them. Once there you can set the author, title and any other metadata you want to set. On a Mac click on the mp3 you want to edit. ⌘ Command  i  will bring up the dialog to do that.\nOne of the things to remember to do when setting the Author, title etc. is to click the options tab and check \"Remember playback position.\" I also usually set the equalizer to \"Spoken Word\" and just so the audio book doesn't come up when you are listening to your music on shuffle I would also check \"skip while shuffling.\"\nI have found that setting the \"Media kind\" to anything but music often (at least for me) results in strange things happening, so just let iTunes think it is music.\nUsually that will do it. It is not as good as a dedicated audio book player but it does work reasonably well.\n\nA: iTunes turned out to be a dead end. It seems they have intentionally degraded iTunes so that one cannot set a .mp3 file to be an audiobook, so old books you already own must have a new license purchased. ($$$)\nThe solution was an iPhone app:\n\"MP3 Audiobook Player\"\nInstall it, plug your iPhone into your laptop, open then the Files tab, and drop the folder into \"MP3 Audiobook Player\" and Bingo! your old audiobook.\n\nA: You have to add them (drag them from the Finder if you want) to the Apple Books app.\nIt's as simple as that, no need to modify metadata. If you do –add a cover, author, etc.– it will show up there and make the book look nicer.\nThis change was introduced when Apple phased out iTunes and made individual apps for each component: tv for movies and the subscription service, Music for the subscription service and your personal library; they moved audiobooks to the Book app and Podcasts were stand alone already.\nI'm on macOS Catalina 10.15.7 and Books app 2.4 (1923.1)\n\nOP mentioned not being able to edit metadata on iTunes (I guess they were thinking of the Music app); you can use other metadata handlers if that is the case. MusicBrainz Picard will search for the correct metadata on its database, and even add a cover if there's one available.\nYou can then sync the books and more with the Finder, look for your phone on the left and click on it. Then go to the \"Audiobooks\" section and check the proper options.\n\nIf you want to go wireless, you can use the free 5 GB tier if your book library is not too big.\nTo have the books synced to your iPhone you need to activate iCloud Drive.\n\nand check \"Books\" on the Options. You don't need to activate any other app or service if this is the only thing you need synced.\n\nIn order to avoid many headaches, deactivate the Desktop and Document folders option, unless you know what you're doing (here's Apple Support guide in case you want to go that route).\n\nYou can sync bookmarks, highlights, and collections if you want; that's on the Books app preferences.\n\n\nA: BookPlayer app can add folders with mp3s and play them as one audiobook. To copy book to phone you can use itunes.\n", "Q: What version of Apple TV is required for a HomePod mini stereo pair to work? I have two HomePod minis configured as a stereo pair, that is not recognized by my Apple TV. Instead I see each individual HomePod in the audio settings for the TV and can only select and play through one at a time. I have a very old Apple TV (a replacement is on order) and also a very old AirPort Extreme Base Station (also about to be replaced).\nWhat version of Apple TV is required for a HomePod mini stereo pair to work?\n\nA: HomePod stereo pairs work with Apple TV 4K and HomePod or HomePod mini. When using it with HomePod mini, Dolby Atmos 5.1/7.1 surround sound are not supported.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207705\n\nA: Unfortunately, Home Theatre Audio does not currently work with HomePod mini (just HomePod). It also seems to require Apple TV 4K. The benefit of this feature is that you can set your Apple TV audio output to permanently use the HomePod pair.\nBut you should be able to (manually) Airplay to a pair of HomePod Mini’s with an Apple TV that supports tvOS 14 (an assumption, based on its support of being an audio hub): this would mean Apple TV HD or Apple TV 4K.\nIf you’re buying a new Apple TV and you’re interested in using your HomePod Mini’s as your permanent tv speakers, I would suggest getting the Apple TV 4K with the assumption that Apple will eventually add Home Theatre Audio support for the HomePod Mini’s.\n", "Q: Possible to create a blockquote in Apple Notes? I'm using Apple Notes for lots of things lately (especially after discovering the Safari note taking workflow described here). Often I want to indicate a section is a quote, much like I can with Markdown, here in Stack Exchange, in GitHub, Slack, etc.\n\nLike this\n\nIs there any way to do a blockquote in Apple Notes?\n\nA: I have never seen such an option. In macOS, the built-in help (Help > Notes Help) makes no mention of a block quote feature in the \"Write and format notes\" section, and a search within Notes help for \"quote\" did not return any results.\nI think your best option is to increase the indentation of the text using Format > Indentation > Increase (⌘]).\nOn iOS and iPadOS, there is an option to increase indent under the format (Aa) menu.\n", "Q: GDB Hangs after \"New Thread\" on macOS I have built GDB from source on macOS 12.0 and codesigned it.

On an Intel Mac it was possible and legal to run a \"Mac-on-Mac\" VM, i.e. to run macOS within a virtual machine hypervisor running on macOS. Does any product or demonstration exist for the same on an Apple Silicon (M1) Mac?\nFor its part, VMWare's most recent public update included a bullet point\n\nmacOS VMs are not in scope in the short term. There are challenges there which will require Apple to work with us to resolve.\n\nwith no further explanation to be found in the remainder of their blog post. Has their competitor Parallels had better luck? Or, if the \"challenges\" are more of the contractual or simply \"polished user experience\" sort, perhaps a more independent hobbyist or hacker has overcome them at least in a proof-of-concept fashion?\nTo be clear in this question I am not specifically asking if it's possible to run an older Intel version of macOS on an ARM processor (which admittedly would fulfill similar purposes but likely in a less-performant way), but mostly whether there is currently any way to run an Apple Silicon macOS guest under an Apple Silicon macOS host?\n\nA: Yes, there is now! The macOS version of the UTM app supports Monterey M1 guests and even has a wizard to assist in automatic installation. Some other options might also be on their way from their respective development teams.\nOriginally, the Apple Silicon M1 processor was released alongside macOS 11 Big Sur, but I never found any product or technique claiming to support that macOS version.\nThe VMware Fusion team described the situation early on as:\n\nmacOS VMs are not in scope in the short term. There are challenges there which will require Apple to work with us to resolve.\n\nA contributor to the open source macOS/iOS UTM app described the [/one?] challenge as:\n\nthere is no [option to present M1 hardware directly to the VM] available in macOS Big Sur. It is coming in the next release of macOS, Monterey, later this year\n\nAnd indeed with Monterey, the ARM-based macOS VM story has been changing:\n\n*\n\n*An open-source proof of concept appeared for an M1 guest on an M1 host (step-by-step walkthrough at e.g. https://mrmacintosh.com/you-can-now-virtualize-macos-on-an-m1-mac-with-macos-monterey/).\n\n*The developers of the UTM app have hinted that they are working on support for M1 macOS virtualization in an unreleased dev-monterey branch of their codebase. Update: as of the 3.x releases, the UTM app's support for macOS Monterey guests is now available! Beyond the automatic installation, there's not currently a lot of \"user friendly\" features like file transfer or copy/paste or USB passthrough between guest and host, but the basic VM is a go.\n\n*Parallels has a knowledge base article (\"Last Review: Feb 3, 2022\") covering how to Install macOS Monterey 12 virtual machine on a Mac with Apple M1 chip.\n\n*As of my last edits here, there's still no mention of Monterey guest support in VMware Fusion's latest blog posts. The latest September 2021 version (v0.4) of their testing guide for their Tech Preview still lists a \"macOS Guest VM\" as \"Not currently supported\". I did find this post walking through various Monterey installation workarounds for Fusion but it's unclear if they work in the M1 or only the Intel case.\n\n*Oracle® VM VirtualBox™ will not support this. Despite its generic-sounding name and its temporary usefulness to Apple customers throughout the 10.4.4–10.15.3 eras of OS X and macOS, the VirtualBox developers are focused solely on x86 virtualization (excluding x86 emulation). That is: only x86 guests running only under x86 hosts. Since an M1 box is not an x86 box, VirtualBox will no longer be relevant to Mac users going forward for any guest OS. (My conclusion here is based on the verdict among moderators of its forum that an ARM port would be completely unpossible; and another moderator of the VirtualBox forums closed this ticket with \"VirtualBox is an x86 emulator. I don't think that an ARM port (or a PowerPC, or a Sparc, or a <InsertFavoriteArchitectureHere>) will ever happen.\" The team has apparently always been solely focused on the one CPU architecture and has indicated they will continue that tradition for Apple Silicon as well. So that makes the other big pressing question — whether or not they ever intended to move off their deprecated custom .kext onto the currently supported Hypervisor.framework — moot unless Apple ever migrates back to x86 processors in the future.)\n\n\nA: The macOS guest on top of macOS host running ARM hardware is supported officially by parallels with Monterey v12.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.parallels.com/eu/products/desktop/resources/\nPreviously on Big Sur, there were five OS guest options with Parallels:\n\n*\n\n*Windows 10 on ARM Insider Preview\n\n*Ubuntu 20.10, 20.04\n\n*Fedora Workstation 33-1.2\n\n*Debian GNU/Linux 10.7\n\n*Kali Linux 2021.1\n\nOf those, Windows and Linux ARM OS ran on Apple Silicon (M1).\n\n*\n\n*https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html\nThe VMware Fusion hypervisor doesn’t officially support Apple Silicon (M1) guest yet.\n", "Q: What is the meaning of this feature “Camera, recently” I am using an iPhone 11 with iOS on 14.4.2.\nI have noticed that there is a hint text after taking a video clip.

The T model isn't ideal, and I haven't been able to find a PSU or an adapter for Magsafe 2. I'd prefer either Magsafe 1 -style L-adapter, or downward angled one. Do those exist?\n\nA: MagSafe adapters are trivial to safely machine since it’s a pair of grounds, pair of conductors and DC low-voltage basic conductors.\nThings get dicey when you move to angled and MagSafe USB-C adapters. The shielding and space issues make them finicky or harmful. At low data rates, the cables are not actively terminated, but the newer ones aren’t simply twisted wire pairs. Also, most are clunky and worse than the supplied cables, but to each their own preference - I could see some cases where you needed a hard stop and couldn’t accommodate a traditional cable bend.\nI know of no legit / reliable / sound of engineering angled Thunderbolt adapter or cable. I suppose they could be made, just those I’ve seen are highly suspect.

Its Mac App Store page only says the iPhone and iPad counterpart apps are available, but nothing about those being universal (or not).\nThe other app I'm looking at is iA Writer for Mac OS (but could be any other app, really), and unlike the Good Notes 5, I couldn't find any external mention of iA Writer being bundled with the iOS and ipadOS apps as a single purchase.\nSo can I somehow tell myself, without contacting the developers every time I need an answer, just by looking at the App Store pages, it's source code, or maybe making and API call of some sort?\n\nA: I think I found the answer: you will have to find the app on both Mac and iOS App Stores, get the shareable link and compare the IDs. If those match, chances are it's a bundled app.\nUPD: The next day after posting this, iA Writer Support sent me a reply which doesn't conflict with my above theory:\n\n\nIf I buy the app on the Mac App Store, is it a universal purchase and are the iOS counterparts for iPhone and iPad bundled with it?

It works just as expected when I use finder to put files in the \"Process\" folder, but I also need it to process files when Google Drive Sync downloads a file into the \"Process\" folder as well. When I tried using Google Sync to download in files the Folder Action never got triggered. It didn't seem to matter how many files got downloaded in by Google Drive Sync it didn't trigger the Folder Action. I know the script is working because if I then added a file to the folder manually with Finder it would run the Folder Action on all the files in the folder even the ones that Google Sync added. For some reason the downloading of the file into the folder by Google Sync just isn't triggering the Folder Action.\nIs there a way to set this up so that when Google Drive Sync finishes downloading the a file into the folder it also triggers the Folder Action I created?\n\nA: I just tested this process and it works for me.  First I would not have Google Drive sync files directly into your “Process Folder”.  Let Backup and Sync download and sync everything to and from the Google Dive folder on your computer.\nTo do this, quit the Backup and Sync app. Then go to Finder and temporarily move the current folder it is synching to, to a different location. Then launch Backup and Sync app and in your menu bar Click —> Backup and Sync and then Locate. Find your Google Drive folder and click Open.\nAfter that is all set up and working correctly, go back and move that folder that you temporally moved, back to its original location.\nNext, we will create a Folder Action to attach to your Google Drive folder.  Now, when files are added to that Google Drive folder and after they are finished synching, the Folder Action will move the synched files to your “Process Folder”.  Once that happens, those files should trigger your already existing Folder Action attached to the “Process Folder”.\n\nAfter inserting the path to your “Process” Folder (between the quote marks in this line)…\nproperty processFolder : alias \"\"\nSave this following AppleScript code in Script Editor.app to your /Users/YOUR_SHORT_NAME/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions.  folder\nproperty processFolder : alias \"\" — insert path to your “Process” Folder\n\non adding folder items to theFolder after receiving theNewItems\n    --  Called After Items Have Been Added To A Folder\n    --\n    --  theFolder is a reference to the modified folder\n    --  theNewItems is a list of references to the items added to the folder \n    repeat with thisItem in theNewItems\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            (move thisItem to moveToFolder) as alias\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\nif you don’t know how to properly get the path to your “Process” folder, run this following one line of code in a separate document.

(Will describe what happened later in this question if interested.)\nFor several reasons, I used fdisk on Linux (Ubuntu on flash drive) to wipe everything off from that internal disk by applying the GPT scheme to the disk. The disk is totally visible as /dev/nvme0n1 on Ubuntu. However it's not on macOS's recovery mode.\nWhen I go into recovery mode (did both Command + R and Option + Command + R but it's always El Capitan for some reasons), Disk Utility GUI won't show anything besides \"Apple disk image Media\". (It will show USB flash drive if I plugged them in.) If I move onto CLI version of it, diskutil list will return something like this:\n/dev/disk0 (disk image):\n    #:                      TYPE NAME                      SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:     GUID_partition_scheme                          +2.1 GB     disk0\n    1:                 Apple_HFS OS X Base System          2.0 GB     disk0s\n/dev/disk1 (disk image):\n    #:                      TYPE NAME                      SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:                           untitled                 +5.2 MB     disk1\n# ..\n# other 11 disks with similar stuff sized in between 524.3KB (half of those) to 6.3MB\n# ..\n/dev/disk13 (disk image):\n    #:                      TYPE NAME                      SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:                           untitled                 +6.3 MB     disk13\n\nWhereas I expect something as follows:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n    #:                      TYPE NAME                      SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:     GUID_partition_scheme                          +1.0 TB     disk0\n/dev/disk1 (disk image):\n    #:                      TYPE NAME                      SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:     GUID_partition_scheme                          +2.1 GB     disk1\n    1:                 Apple_HFS OS X Base System          2.0 GB     disk1s\n\nls /dev would not show much interesting output, and there certainly are nothing like nvme0.\nAre there more cleaning up to do on the disk (such as removing snapshots from APFS? Are these 13 disk images those snapshots from the disk somehow)??\n\nAnd here is it for post mortem, more specifics for what this is and how it's got bricked.\nHardware\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro [Intel, No T2 chip] (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\n\n*NVMe SSD that I swapped with original. Although it is not the original SSD, installation (BigSur)\nworked successfully once, with zero hiccups. So I believe hardware isn't the problem.\n\nHow it got bricked\nShort version:\nI was trying triple boot setup, which was unsuccessful and tried to start it over by undoing it by asking macOS Boot Camp Assistant to wipe them off, which returned the error, leaving Linux partitions un-wiped. Now it won't boot up.\nLong version:\nPhysical upgrade (Successful)\n\n*\n\n*Swapped with new 1TB SSD, formatted with APFS (I think), installed macOS from Time Machine backup. No hiccups, perfect experience.\n\nDual-boot (Successful)\n\n\n*Installed Windows 10 with Boot Camp Assistant, just as Apple recommends. Left 500GB for Mac and the rest 500GB for Windows. Again, works like a charm as expected, no hiccups.\n\nTriple-boot (Failed)\n\n\n*Boot into Windows and use Disk Management to shrink the Windows partition. Now it's [500GB: macOS] + [250GB: Windows] + [250GB: unallocated]. So far it boots to both OS with no problem (although Mac's Disk Utility GUI might have not be happy with this, but I don't remember.)\n\n*Installed rEFInd, so now it boots into rEFInd menu, and shows both Mac/Windows options, as expected. So far so good.\n\n*(Try installing Fedora and I couldn't see no success, so I gave up. Wiped off new partition - and everything works just like before.)\n\n*Installed Ubuntu but it didn't boot into Ubuntu although the rEFInd menu shows the Ubuntu icon (as it did install /boot/efi into existing EFI partition). Now Windows won't boot.\n\n*Reinstalled rEFInd, and now Ubuntu works, but Windows does not.\n\n*Now it boots into rEFInd menu, and macOS and Ubuntu works, but Windows does not. I couldn't figure the fix so I decided to start over with simple dual boot setup the way Apple supports.\n\nStarting over (Failed)\n\n\n*Asked Boot Camp Assistant to wipe current Boot Camp. Took a few minutes doing this and that, and it threw some error (which I didn't take memo regrettably). Disk Utility GUI was showing something glitchy (which I didn't take memo neither), and it didn't wipe Linux partitions.\n\n*Booted into Linux (Ubuntu) from USB flashdrive, and used fdisk to apply new GPT to the disk.\n\nAnd now diskutil list won't recognize the physical disk.\n\nA: That particular disk that I was using had an OS requirement in description as follows:\n\nRequires Mac OS X 10.13 High Sierra or Higher BEFORE and AFTER installation\n\nThus the answer was that I needed Recovery Mode of newer macOS version for that disk to be able to detected. If anyone had a similar problem, you should check the requirement for that particular model also.\n\nWhat I did\nI did the following firstly, but you may not need them.\n\n*\n\n*Turn off firmware password\n\n*NVRAM reset\nThen I booted Mac into Recovery Mode with Option + Command + R, typed WiFi credentials in, and it automatically updated the Recovery Mode into the latest version (Big Sur).\nProceed to open the Disk Utility, and now it recognizes the disk!\nFormat the disk and now the latest OS is ready to be installed, and it should work throughly as I did.\nBut I had to repeat this umpteenth times. If this didn't work in first try, please read follows.\n\nMaybe don't give up, and keep trying!\nNow the very odd part was that, I did all that and the result was either\n\n*\n\n*Get \"-2003F\" error, and full stop there.\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode but the old version of Mac (El Capitan in my case).\n\nInternet connection was reasonably stable (the one for my home that has very conventional setup, no particular firewall fiddling on any port). (I thought Ethernet dongle helps, but apparently it has to be Apple's dongle so perhaps that try had no use.)\nAnother thing that seemed rather odd is that, Apple's official Mac startup key combinations help page does not make distinction between Option + Command + R and Command + R anymore, which they used to back in the day. Although both of the combinations seemed as though they did try to connect to internet anyways (as it had globe icon), I think it's worth trying for the one with Option key especially if you had machine that are rather old like mine.\nAnyhow, I swear I had it for more than 10 times for each, but now it worked. Only difference was the time I tried, which was early afternoon, and I got it through around 11PM, so probably that was about the slow internet connection.\nIf you were using public WiFi, it might be better to find another stable network until it boots into the latest version of Recovery Mode (of course that is as long as your Mac supports the version later than what you already have.)\n\nOther suggestions\nHere's few other options that may work, though I have tested none of these.\nBooting from another disk that has macOS of later version installed.\nTarget Disk mode\nNeeds cable to connect the two Macs, such as thunderbolt cable\n\n*\n\n*Use other updated machine in target disk mode and connect to the machine with the unformatted disk.\n\n*Boot into Startup Manager to boot into the updated version of macOS. Log in and use Disk Utility.\n\nPhysically attach the disk\nNeeds the other Mac to be able to detach internal disk, and an adapter\n\n*\n\n*Take out the disk with new macOS, use adapter (such like SATA to USB adapter) to connect the disk as USB peripheral to the machine.\n\n*Boot into Startup Manager to choose that attached drive into the updated version of macOS.\n\nBypass the driver problem with adapter\nNeeds an adapter\n\n*\n\n*Use adapter to connect the disk as peripheral (such as NVMe to USB adapter, etc) so the old OS can recognize it as USB drive.\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode and now it should be able to see the drive in Disk Utility.\n\n\nCredit: @DavidAnderson: Thanks for a little hint and advice!\n\nA: Same symptoms, different solution\nI had these very similar symptoms with my macbook pro mid 2012.\nI did have only OS El Capitan on the main SSD internal but i tried to boot a Ventoy USB Drive with iso to test (ubuntu, tails, etc).

I only own a MacBook and whenever I try to log in to the App Store I get the message: \"An Apple ID verification code is required to sign in. Type your password followed by the verification code shown on your other devices.\"\nI'm not sure what this means. If the message makes sense, shouldn't I have received a text message on my (Android) phone that's connected to my Apple ID?\nI'm able to log in to my Apple ID on the website perfectly fine. What am I supposed to do here?\nThe OS that I'm using is Mavericks btw. Thanks!\n\nA: This happens because you have enabled 2-factor authentication on your Apple-ID (which is a good thing). Mavericks was created before this 2-factor authentication method was available for Apple-IDs and thus do not know about it. In order to still support logging in from Mavericks, you have to enter not only your password in the password field, but your password followed by the 2-factor verification code (6 digits).\nThe verification code is shown automatically on trusted devices (such as iPhones, iPads and Macs). If you haven't got a trusted device and are logging in through a web site, an iOS device or a recent macOS version, you'll be able to choose to have the verification sent as a text message or voice call. However, if you only have your Mavericks Mac, it is too old to support that feature.\nI would suggest upgrading your macOS version to the latest possible version. 2-factor authentication is fully supported with Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11). Your MacBook running Mavericks should be fully capable of running El Capitan as well.\n", "Q: Airdrop Directional File Flow I can't seem to transfer a file from my iPhone to my MacBook (running Big Sur 11.2) recently. I have already checked and that both devices have their Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on. Both devices are set in the \"everyone\" mode for airdrop. I cannot find the device in the airdrop menu on my phone, and it just shows \"No People Found\". I have handoff and firewall off on my Mac. However, it works when I send a file from my Mac to my iPhone.\nI have searched other questions on this site, but those say that there are no response when they click on it instead of \"no people found\".\nEdit: I've also tried to disable airdrop and enabling it again as well.\nI rebooted my mac and it works now. I still wonder why it doesn't work though.\n\nA: If it doesn't happen again, you'll probably never know. That's unfortunately the reality of things.\nAirDrop, as much other software today, is based on several very complex subsystems. Bugs happen and it can be difficult or almost impossible to explain them or locate them, unless it is possible to reliably reproduce the problem.\nIt is very likely that some bug caused some software that AirDrop depends on to be in the wrong state. It could be a driver failure, a bug in the network protocol implementation, or any other bug. When you rebooted the Mac, everything starts over from a valid state - and you won't experience the problem.\n", "Q: MacOS cannot copy \"special\" files...they are marked with \"s\" Their permission scheme is srwxr-xr-x.\nI can't copy them, as I get the following error message.\n\ncp: cannot create special file '/Volumes/Samsung_T5/Dockers/vms/0/00000002.00001003': Operation not permitted\n\nI tried with sudo, but the files are still not copied, although the message is a bit different. This time, it says \"Invalid argument.\"\nAnd yes, I'm trying to move Docker folder to an external disks as it is filling up my hard disk.\n\nA: This is a (s)ocket type file. As such, it doesn't have any persistent data associated with it and thus it makes no sense to copy it.\nSockets enable communication between two different processes on the same or on different machines. This communication is done using standard Unix/Linux file descriptors, using read() and write() system calls.\n\nA: The first character in the output of ls -l is the type of file: - for a regular file (whatever type its contents is), d for a directory, etc. s indicates a socket, which is a location that programs can use to communicate (a server listens to connections on the socket, and clients can communicate with the server by opening a connection on the socket).\nSockets don't have contents, but their existence is necessary for the software that uses it, and their permissions matter. If software uses a socket, and it doesn't automatically create it when it starts, you need to copy it. (Creating the socket when the server starts is sometimes possible because everything about the socket is well-known, and sometimes not possible because the location and metadata can vary).\nThere seems to be a bug with macOS's cp command that it doesn't know how to copy sockets. (I get the error “Operation not supported on socket” on Big Sur, so it looks like this is a known limitation, but it's still a bug because cp should be able to copy sockets.) Note that a plain cp copies file contents, but with the option -R or -a, cp should copy special files such as sockets.\nYou can use the rsync command instead:\nrsync -aE /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/\n\nIf you have GNU coreutils installed, its cp command (which may be installed under a different name such as gcp) should be able to do the job as well.\nNote that the target drive must use a filesystem that supports special files.

There are many factors such as heat/temperature, actual charge, power draw, lifecycle/age,... that contribute into \"inconsistent\" measurements.\n\nWhy design capacity is not consistent, sometimes 74%, 75%, 80%?\n\nThis is completely normal and every battery experiences this, especially as they get older. This again depends on many factors and the number will decrease over time/cycles.\n\nI'm just wondering, will my MacBook overcharge or over discharge or this is normal behavior?\n\nWhen at 100% your battery will stop charging. It will start charging again, usually a couple percent below 100% if continually connected to power. macOS tries to smoothen the curve, i.e. it makes you think its constantly at 100%, which it isn't. This behaviour is normal.\nThere are many excellent articles that can explain the physical details much better than I can, but there isn't really anything you should/shouldn't do with your MacBook in terms of battery, except trying to not (over)heat it.

Service found no problems I have a mac book pro 2014 with MacOs 11.2.3\nThe kernel panics are driving me crazy and impacting my work seriously.\nThe usual pattern is the mac freezing followed by the question mark folder. It happens often after awaking, but also while is on since a while. The most common error is \"Could not recover SATA HDD after 5 attempts. Terminating\" but they are quite varied.\nAlso the frequency is quite random: sometimes is fine for days, sometimes it's every hour, with no discernible pattern in my usage.\nI sent it to service to an authorized seller (unfortunately no apple stores nearby) and they said they found no hardware problems, only a lot of dust inside and a worn-out thermal paste.\nI run all possible apple tests and solution and just once the diagnostic tool showed a disk related problem, then never again.\nI started to collect the panic log, maybe one of you will notice something recurring.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/52c9ckrfzsu5qx2/kernel_panic.txt?dl=0\nUPDATE\nI had an intuition and stopped using the airpods for one week. In that period no kernel panics occurred. As soon I started using them again the panics restarted (albeit at a lower frequency). So I'm starting to have compelling evidence it's them or the Bluetooth.\nApple does not seem to acknowledge the problem and insist about the SSD failing...\n\nA: I see a troubling trend: Your panics have many different signatures. As you mention, a number of them point to your SSD, and when I see that, I immediately want to know if you have a full, current backup of your system. You should anticipate total data loss at any moment.\nOnce you know that your data is safe, we can start to gather more information about your panics. The first step is to enable symbolication:\n\n*\n\n*Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) and reboot.\n\n*Run the following command in Terminal: sudo nvram boot-args=\"kextsyms=1\"\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Collect and share new kernel panics as they come in.\n\nAlso, although I'm sure you and/or the authorized seller have already done this, it would be good to run Disk Utility and verify all your volumes for filesystem integrity. A corrupted filesystem is one common cause of mixed panic signatures.\nUPDATE:\nReading your comment on my answer, I now suspect that your SSD is overheating. Evidence:\n\n*\n\n*Numerous panics implicating the SSD.\n\n*Panics with mixed signatures, which can be caused by failed filesystem transactions, such as those resulting from corruption or disk hardware failure.\n\n*Panic frequency increasing with system uptime.\n\n*Panic frequency decreasing after system rests.\n\n*Service technician finding \"lots of dust\" and worm thermal paste.\n\n*The age of the SSD. If you're still on the original device, it's been 7 years. Many consumer SSDs, especially older models, don't tend to last that long. Overheating is one possible failure mode.\n\nYou can test the theory by placing the system in the freezer after the first failure and seeing if it recovers more quickly.\nFor a more rigorous debugging process, I would start by attempting to clean out any dust and replacing thermal paste. Both are easy and inexpensive procedures.\nIf you have a spare drive available, you can try cloning to and booting from that drive and seeing if the problem goes away. You'll have to disconnect your internal SSD first.\nUltimately, if overheating is the root cause and cleaning up your insides doesn't help, it may be time to replace SSDs.\n\nA: I'm probably late to the party, but I was in a very similar situation a while ago.

Loops can run away faster than you adjust an open file limit in my experience.\nNone of the things you tried will help or would be expected to help if the IDE sets its own limits rather than relying only on system limits.\nIf you want to do heavy background processing on your Mac, you should consider enabling macOS Performance Mode: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202528\nEnabling macOS Performance Mode changes a number of system settings (also settable with sysctl) to lift limits and otherwise optimise the system for heavy-lifting instead of normal desktop usage.\nYou might also consider that it might be faster to virtualise another unix or Windows than tuning macOS to your needs.\n", "Q: Understanding APFS firmlink black magic I'm slowly coming to terms with the black magic behind the APFS system/data volume split. Today, however, I found an artifact that I just don't understand: files that simultaneously exist and do not.\nThe question is: in the sequence below, why do ls and find see a merged view sometimes and not others?\nFor example, we know that /usr/share contains entries from both the system volume (high-numbered inodes) and one from the Data volume (low-numbered inodes, specifically snmp):\n# ls -li /usr/share\ntotal 8\n...\n1152921500312798809 drwxr-xr-x    2 root  wheel    64 Jan  1  2020 skel\n            4054997 drwxr-xr-x   28 root  wheel   896 Jan  1  2020 snmp\n1152921500312798811 drwxr-xr-x    6 root  wheel   192 Jan  1  2020 tabset\n...\n\nIt makes sense, therefore, that inspecting the Data volume only shows the Data entries:\n# ls -li /System/Volumes/Data/usr/share\ntotal 0\n4054997 drwxr-xr-x  28 root  wheel  896 Jan  1  2020 snmp\n\nAs expected, find sees all of the files through / and only the Data files through /System/Volumes/Data, regardless of -x:\n# find /usr/share | grep '^/usr/share/' | wc -l\n   14956\n# find -x /usr/share | grep '^/usr/share/' | wc -l\n   14956\n# find /System/Volumes/Data/usr/share | grep '^/System/Volumes/Data/usr/share/' | wc -l\n     179\n# find -x /System/Volumes/Data/usr/share | grep '^/System/Volumes/Data/usr/share/' | wc -l\n     179\n\n\nHere's where things get strange, however. If I do the same find from one level up, all of a sudden I get the merged view both ways:\n# find /usr | grep '^/usr/share/' | wc -l\n   14956\n# find -x /usr | grep '^/usr/share/' | wc -l\n   14956\n# find /System/Volumes/Data/usr | grep /System/Volumes/Data/usr/share/ | wc -l\n   14956\n# find -x /System/Volumes/Data/usr | grep /System/Volumes/Data/usr/share/ | wc -l\n   14956\n\nYou can see the same behavior if you compare the outputs of ls:\n# ls /usr/share\n# ls /System/Volumes/Data/usr/share\n# ls -R /System/Volumes/Data/usr\n\nI've been digging through the code for find and fts, however, and I don't see any trap doors for firmlinks.\nInterestingly, the Gnu version of these tools do not see the merged view, so it's something in the Apple version.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: The behavior of chdir and fchdir appears to be broken. Consider the following minimal example:\n#include <assert.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\n\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {\n    chdir(\"/System/Volumes/Data/usr/libexec\");\n    assert(strcmp(getwd(NULL), \"/System/Volumes/Data/usr/libexec\") == 0);\n\n    chdir(\"cups\");\n    assert(strcmp(getwd(NULL), \"/System/Volumes/Data/usr/libexec/cups\") == 0); // will be \"/usr/libexec/cups\" instead.\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nNote that you cannot reproduce it in a shell (e.g. Zsh) because its chdir will unwind the relative path into an absolute path (i.e. /System/Volumes/Data/usr/libexec/cups) before actually changing current directory.\n", "Q: Apple's unicode keyboard layout versions location Based on the \"ISO\" standard, say you we're to buy a keyboard and then plug it in. Note, I have never attempted this, but am assured it will work after changing your keyboard's input source.\nIs there a location on the Mac OSX Big Sur operating system where these different key mappings are stored? Where it would be easier to program based on these files? Where are these mapping located?\nKeyboard\nGoal: (Input) American\nTranslated: (Other) Language\nWorking Example (Referenced From Comment):\nI am trying to specifically translate code made in the USA in the standard format. Then run it through an AI translator which then reformats the file encoding and also the Unicode characters exactly as they were typed on a foreign computer. So the input file becomes a new file with a new file encoding standard relative to that specific country, then the characters are also changed to a specific desired Unicode standard\nOr would it be best to programmatically change this?\n\nA: Computers normally use a single encoding system, ISO 10646/Unicode, that covers all languages at once.  It currently gives each of over 100,000 characters a unique idenfier.  All hardware keyboards are essentially the same as regards the codes sent to the computer, only the printing on the keys differs. Software keyboard layouts and input methods in MacOS provide mappings of the standard hardware keyboard output codes to the Unicode codepoints that reflect the requirements of any particular language, while fonts translate those codepoints into glyphs on the screen.\nThis page provides graphics of some of the different language mappings which you can select in MacOS via system preferences/keyboard/input sources.  These can be applied to any hardware keyboard and all use Unicode encoding.\nThese software mapping files are found in system/libary/keyboard layouts and system/library/input methods on a Mac.   Users can also create custom mappings with apps like Ukelele and Karabiner and other methods.\nBut I don’t offhand think such mapping files would play any role in a translation system of the sort you are describing.\n", "Q: In Apple Music (Big Sur), how can I 'go to current song playing' in the context of the main library? You used to be able to click Cmd+L to highlight the current song in the context of its playlist. However, this doesn't work anymore for songs being played in the library - only when playing from a custom playlist. It will show the song playing in the library but not in the context of the rest of the library. This feature was helpful because it allowed me to look at other songs in proximity to what was playing.\n\nA: Click Cmd + L. This will show you the album that is currently playing. Then click on 'songs' in the sidebar. This will take you to the current song in library view. (What used to be a one-step process is now two steps).\n\nA: Click on the musical note to the left of Songs in the sidebar. It brings you back to the song list.\n", "Q: MacbookPro - does it have an HDMI port The official website says:\n\nNote: Mac Pro has at least one HDMI 2.0 port and four Thunderbolt 3\n(USB-C) ports.\n\nIs it meant for all generic MacBook pros? Because I don't see an HDMI port on my mac. Where exactly is it located? Is the documentation wrong?\n\nA: You are quoting from the spec page for a Mac Pro, not the MacBook Pro.  The Mac Pro certainly has a HDMI port.\nThe MacBook Pro may have one, depending on which one you have.\nThe most recent one does not, in either 13\" or 16\" sizes.\nhttps://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/specs/\n", "Q: Does a usb-c to hdmi cable actually exist? So my macbook pro has a usb-c  cable. I want to connect it to my tv using hdmi.\nI've come across this product\nHowever, I'm not sure if it's a punk. It's my understanding that I need an intermediate adaptor to connect to it to my tv. Whereas this product claims to directly connect my macbook pro to the TV. Am I missing something?\n\nA: Yes, I have one (not that make specifically but another HDMI to USB-C) and it works fine with my MacBook. There’s no need for any other components along the way.\n\nA: All MacBook Pro models with USB type C ports offer USB, Thunderbolt 3 and DisplayPort functionality through these ports.\nThe cable is not a direct connection. The USB Type C jack on the MacBook Pro operates in Alt mode to provide DisplayPort output. The cable has a builtin adaptor to convert from DisplayPort to HDMI.\nAn adaptor has a USB Type C plug on one end and a HDMI jack on the other end. You have to use a HDMI cable with plugs on both ends to reach the monitor.\nWhat you have is a cable (with built in adapter). This cable has a USB Type C plug on one end and a HDMI plug on the other end. You can plug this cable into the monitor.\n", "Q: Photos: Move images from iCloud to local storage without losing metadata (albums, tags, etc)? I'm looking free space in my iCloud storage my moving images to local storage only.\nI know I can export the full size images, delete them from Photos.app, then re-add them to Photos as referenced photos. But doing this will lose all the metadata in Photos (albums, tags, etc), not to mention moving them to the top of my recently added all-photos list.\nMy beloved and lamented Aperture had the Relocate Originals command which would move a managed photo to external storage, but Photos doesn't seem to have this. Is there any AppleScript or Swift-accessible system api command that can?\nAny way to do this short of writing my own migration tool to save all the possible metadata, then re-add it to the deleted-then-reimported-as-referenced photos?\nCheers!\n\nA: Assuming your photo library is complete (\"Download Originals\" is checked), I'd recommend the following process:\n\n*\n\n*Close out Photos\n\n*In Finder, navigate to the Photos library (~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary)\n\n*Duplicate the library (Right click > Duplicate), then open it by double clicking\n\n*\n\n*This shouldn't double the amount of space used by the device since the system will link the original files together until one is modified\n\n\n\n*You will be able to confirm disconnection from iCloud.\n\n*Delete photos from the non-iCloud copy that you want to keep in iCloud.\n\n*Delete photos from the iCloud copy that you want to keep local only.\n\n*Empty the recently deleted on the local copy to save space\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot repeat this process and merge local libraries. If this is for archival purposes, I'd recommend planning on using a new target library for each period of time or event you're archiving.\n\n\nA: Assuming that your Photo library syncs with iCloud: Why does (within the Photos.app on the Mac) \"File > Export > Export .... photos\" and activating the checkmark to include all metadata not work for you?\nOr you use e.g.  “Photos Takeout”.\n", "Q: Run AppleScript as login item but only if it meets specific time criterion I have this AppleScript as a \"login item\" (it runs every time I login), but I really just need it to run the code if I login between 5:00 AM and 11:00 pm.\nI would appreciate your help to achieve this result.\ndelay 60    \ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \" \" using {option down}    \ndelay 1    \ntell application \"System Events\"        \n    keystroke \"start\"       \nend tell    \ntell application \"System Events\" to key code 36 \n\n\nA: You can wrap your code in an if statement block that checks the seconds since midnight:\nExample AppleScript code:\nset secondsSinceMidnight to time of (current date)\n\nif secondsSinceMidnight ≥ 18000 and secondsSinceMidnight ≤ 82800 then\n    \n    --  # Your code goes here.\n    \n    \nend if\n\n\nNotes:\nI assume the code you show in your question is either just part of it, as keystroke with System Events is sent to the front most window,  or you are manually bring the target window front most before the code is run.\nIf you place your code within the example if statement block, as coded, only the code within it will be run if it's between 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM.\nHave a look at current date and the date class in the AppleScript Language Guide .\n", "Q: Does MacPorts keep a log for actions like install and upgrade? After I ran sudo port upgrade outdated I’d like to know what was upgraded. The output was longer than my scrollback buffer.\nI checked /opt/local/var/macports/logs/ but it seems to only contain logs for some of the compilations, not installation. For example, a copy of the output of sudo port upgrade outdated would be nice. Right now I simply tee the output to a file, but this kills the nice progress bar since port doesn’t see a TTY at the stdout.\n\nA: I will be semi helpful here.

If I get it right, then AirTags send a Bluetooth-signal to other iOS-devices within the reach of Bluetooth. The iOS-device then sends the received message to iCloud and iCloud then messages the owner.\nNow, I ask myself: If I lose an item in an unpopulated area, like for example in a wood, would I benefit of having an AirTag attached to it? Even if it's very unlikely that someone with an iPhone passes by?\nYesterday I made an trial. I got the impression, that an iPhone memorizes the last location on which it had contact to a coupled AirTag. I'm I right there?\nIf that's the case then the AirTag would be still useful as marker, where I parked my car or where I lost my wallet.\n\nA: Your iPhone scans for both AirTags it knows and ones it doesn't, and updating the location for both ‘types’ of AirTag. This means you are correct that your iPhone would show the last location it knows for your own AirTags even if that location is not updated again by anyone else.\n", "Q: iPhone 12 mini: Screen too dark in sunlight I switched on and off the adaptive brightnes function.\nThe brightness is set to maximum.\nBut still, I hardly can see anything on the screen, as it is too dark.\nMy GF's Android next to it is about double as bright.\nI realized it's really hot.

Recently I’ve restored my iPad from an iCloud backup and now Safari open tabs synchronization doesn’t work for it anymore.\nThere are two devices in my iCloud: iPhone and iPad. Both of them are running the latest iOS 14.5.1. When I try to access iPad Tabs from the iPhone, everything works well. When I try to access iPhone Tabs from the iPad, I get a long list of tabs that were closed long time ago and new open tabs do not synchronize. If I try to force delete these “zombie” open tabs (that do not actually exist on the iPhone) from the iPad, they keep reappearing in the list and nothing else happens. Currently opened iPhone tabs don’t show up on the iPad’s Safari list.\nI’ve tried to delete Safari history as well as restart Safari synchronization (disable and enable it again), but it did not help.\nI wonder if anyone encountered a similar issue and could suggest a solution without wiping the devices.

I didn't discover that the command key was actually working until troubleshooting on https://keyboardchecker.com.\nThe Menu list shortcuts are still greyed out. I don't have a solution for this, but its cosmetic as the shortcuts still work, even ones I assign in keyboard prefs.\n", "Q: Can a Mac be programmed to simulate pressing a key at or immediately after the launch of an app or opening of a type file? I am trying to set the Preview app to not jump from page to page, but scroll between them and only show one column of pages, but I found that the relevant settings won't actually be stored, and will reset after a restart of the app or on the opening of the next file.\nEDIT: although there is dedicated function for setting the default one or two page and scroll or non-scroll settings, however, for over 6 years, Preview is buggy, and won't be able to store it. After restarting the app, and opening a .pdf for the very first time it will still open it in 2-page, non-scroll setting.\nTo find the dedicated (non-operational) function:\nGo to Preview > Preferences... > PDF > Opening for the first time: Show as > Continuous Scroll.\nThis is supposed to set the app to open with one-page continuous scroll even after the app is closed; however, it will NOT store this setting.\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't get exactly what you want.\nThe nearest way is to go to Preferences in Preview.app and on the PDF tab there is an entry for Opening for the first time. This should be set to Continuous scroll.\n\nFor most cases you will get one page and you can scroll by lines etc.\nThe reason that is not exactly what you want is that if you make the Preview window full screen and it is wide enough to show two pages it will show two pages\n\nA: From comments:\n\nuser3439894 — It seems like this would need scripting; I can't code much. Any chance you could share your method\n\nHere are the two functions I use in my init.lua file for Hammerspoon to always set Continuous Scroll in Preview, especially in Full Screen view:\nfunction applicationPreviewWatcher(appName, eventType, appObject)\n    if (eventType == hs.application.watcher.activated) then\n        if (appName == \"Preview\") then\n            appObject:selectMenuItem({\"View\", \"Continuous Scroll\"})\n        end\n    end\nend\nappPreviewWatcher = hs.application.watcher.new(applicationPreviewWatcher)\nappPreviewWatcher:start()\n-- appPreviewWatcher:stop()\n\nfunction spaceHasChangedForPreview()\n    local asCommand = \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to return name of process 1 whose frontmost is true\"\n    local ok, theFrontmostAppName = hs.osascript.applescript(asCommand)\n    if ok then\n        if (theFrontmostAppName == \"Preview\") then\n            hs.eventtap.keyStroke({\"cmd\"}, \"1\")\n        end\n    end\nend \nspaceWatcherForPreview = hs.spaces.watcher.new(spaceHasChangedForPreview)\nspaceWatcherForPreview:start()\n-- spaceWatcherForPreview:stop()\n\nNotes:\nThe example Lua code and functions used with Hammerspoon along with the example AppleScript code, shown above, was tested under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and works for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate setting in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nThe first function always clicks the Continuous Scroll menu item on the View menu whenever Preview is activated 2.\n\n*\n\n*2 The application has been given keyboard/mouse focus.\n\nThe second function always clicks the Continuous Scroll menu item on the View menu in Preview when the Desktop/Space changes, if Preview went into Full Screen view (or out of it) and Preview is the front most application.\nIn either case whether or not Continuous Scroll menu item on the View menu in Preview is already checked, this ensures it is.\nThe second function is necessary because if your screen is wide enough and Continuous Scroll is checked when the window is not in full screen view it automatically changes to Two Pages when going into full screen view. This keeps it set to Continuous Scroll.\n", "Q: Mac 13inch 2020 model-M1chip- Lenovo USB C gen2 dock station--> Unable to connect dual monitors I have Mac 2020 model, 13 inch & M1 chip model and using Lenovo Dock station- USB C model.\nI am trying to connect my 2 external monitors, but after connection it is displaying duplicate on both the monitors.\nI tried couple of options like with VGA cable, HDMI and other options, but still duplicate mirror is displaying.\nCan any one suggest what is the work around to resolve this issue?\n\nA: You can't connect two external monitors to M1 MacBooks with the extend mode.

In your case, the verification failed, so the resize operation did not take place.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk1s2 0\n\nYou could try repairing the container. Before attempting, I would recommend backing up your personal files. Backing up to a external drive would be best. However, since you have free space, you could enter the command below to create a another APFS container with the APFS volume MyBackup. This answer assumes will have done this.\ndiskutil addpartition disk1s2 apfs MyBackup 0\n\nAt this point, you should boot to macOS Big Sur Internet Recovery. Or, you could boot from a macOS Big Sur installer flash drive.\n\nNote: You should check to see if any of the identifiers have changed. If so, then make the appropriate substitutions in the remaining commands.\n\nThe command below attempts repair.\ndiskutil repairVolume disk1s2\n\nIf repair fails, then you should reinstall macOS BigSur. Below are the commands needed to create a new APFS container with the single APFS volume Macintosh HD. The command given below attempts to delete the APFS Fusion container.\ndiskutil apfs deletecontainer disk1s2 Dummy\n\nIf the above command fails to create an Apple_HFS type partition on both disk0s2 and disk1s2, then enter the command given below.\ndiskutil apfs deletecontainer -force disk1s2 Dummy\n\nThe above command will generate the following warning.\n\nDeleting APFS Container with all of its APFS Volumes\nOperating in the contingency (damaged APFS Container) mode. Only the specified APFS Physical Store disk is guaranteed to be reclaimed. Other APFS Physical Stores which may have defined this APFS Container might need to be reclaimed separately\nDeleting Container\n\nWhen I tested this command, an Apple_KFS type partition was created on both disk0s2 and disk1s2. If this does not happen, then stop and post the output from diskutil list to your question. Post a command to this answer, so I can be informed.\nThe next command creates a new APFS Fusion container.\ndiskutil apfs createcontainer -main disk0s2 -secondary disk1s2\n\nThe next command outputs the identifier for the new APFS Fusion container. Here I will assume the identifier disk2 was output.\ndiskutil info disk0s2 | grep Container\n\nThe next command adds an APFS volume labeled Macintosh HD to the new APFS Fusion container.

I put the DNS of my internet provider next to the ip of my local DNS server (Bind9) , and I can only surf the internet I cannot resolve the names of any of my local servers.\nI try to configure my mac the file resolv.conf (/etc/resolv.conf) adding the line:\n-options timeout: 1 rotate attempts: 1\nBut this has no effect, I still can't resolve the fqdms of my local servers but I can navigate.\nI restart the mac and I still cannot resolve the fqdm and also the entry created in resolv.conf has been deleted :(. Any idea how to configure the DNS in macOS so that they rotate and can use the two DNS servers.\n\nA: The /etc/resolv.conf file is not used for configuring the system resolver, like you would probably be used to on other systems like Linux.\nHowever, the configuration you're trying to make is actually not an ideal one - far from it. You're trying to fix a broken DNS resolver by rotating requests between two different DNS servers. This will add extra time to most name lookups, as well as generate unnecessary errors that for will give you problems with some programs.\nThe best way to solve this is to change your Bind server to do recursive lookups for your internal clients - either by handling them by itself or by forwarding the recursive queries to your ISPs names server.\nIn either case you want to limit recursive lookups to your internal clients. This can be done via adding an access-control list to your named.conf configuration file that specifies what you consider internal, like this:\nacl internal { \n  localhost;\n  localnets;\n  192.168.0.0/24;\n}\n\nThis assumes that your local computers have IP-addresses in the 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.254 range. Adapt as necessary.\nIf you want the server to handle recursive queries by itself, you'll to add the following to the options part of your configuration:\n options {\n   recursion: yes;\n   allow-query { internal; };\n };\n\nIf you want to forward the queries to your ISPs name servers, do it like this instead:\n options {\n   recursion: yes;\n   allow-query { internal; };\n   forwarders {\n      1.2.3.4;\n      5.6.7.8;\n   };\n };\n\nYou'll want to replace 1.2.3.4 and 5.6.7.8 with the actual IPs of your ISPs name servers.\nRemember to reload or restart bind after making changes to the configuration file.\n", "Q: How can I sync original photos from iCloud to a non-Apple computer? How can I automatically copy original-quality (e.g. HEIC) photos from iCloud to a non-Apple computer? I have two decades of photos from various cameras I’ve owned over the years organized on my computer and am trying to understand how to reliably add my Apple-held photos to it.\n\n*\n\n*I’ve seen that I can download photos manually by using “Download: Unmodified Original” in the iCloud web interface, but this is tedious.\n\n*I tried using the iCloud app for Windows, but that apparently only exposes reduced-quality JPEG exports. My iPhone has a setting for “Transfer to Mac or PC: Keep Originals” but I don’t see an analogous setting in the iCloud app.\n\nI’m ready to do substantial initial work to set this up (e.g. custom scripting, running a VM, etc.) but at this point I’m not sure what to even try next.\n\nA: There are multiple ways of doing this I suggest the simplest one .\nFirst you need to download iMazing app on your windows .\nDownload iMazing for PC\nDownload iMazing for MacOS\nLaunch iMazing and connect your device to your Mac or PC.\nSelect your device in the sidebar, then select \"Photos\".\nClick \"Import from Folder\", and select the music you want to import.\nTransfer your Photos.\n", "Q: Printing one iWork Pages-page, twice, on one physical paper? I wrote a short text that would be suitable to print on A5 but I only have A4 in my printer. I need ten physical copies of this text, that is five A4 with it printed twice.\nIs it possible to print the same page twice on one physical paper? And then repeat that five times?\nPlease note that I don't want/need to print on both sides of a physical paper.\nI found some instructions to setup facing pages here https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/pages/tan026e4c95a/mac but that is not what I want (at least it didn't seem to work the way I wanted/expected).\nMy current workaround is to create two pages in Pages with identical content and then print two Pages pages on one physical paper (not printing double sided) but this is annoying when I want to update the content and print it again.\n\nA: Here's a solution that involves an additional saved file and use of the Preview application in addition to the Pages application, but achieves the goal of printing multiple pages twice without duplicating the content within the Pages document.\nUnlike Pages, Preview has a \"Copies per page\" option in its print menu which will print the same document multiple times on the same page.  Using this option, you can save the Pages file as a PDF, open that PDF file in Preview, and then use the \"Copies per page\" option to print the document multiple times.\nNote that it is possible to open a Pages file directly in Preview.  However, the formatting doesn't always exactly match the Pages formatting.  Therefore, depending on the level of document fidelity needed, printing to PDF should be used to ensure correct formatting.\nStep-by-step directions\nFirst, save the document as a PDF using the \"Save as PDF\" option in the print dialog under the \"PDF\" menu in the bottom-left corner of the dialog.\n\nNext, open the PDF in Preview.  Select \"2\" for the \"Copies per page\" option.  Set the number of copies to the desired amount (5 in your case).  Set any other desired print options, then click the \"Print\" button.\n\nThis will print two pages on each physical sheet, as desired.\n\nA: While I don't use Pages.app the macOS print dialog box is pretty standard and that option is to be found in most apps.\nIn Safari (below) when you go to print, you get this when you select \"Layout\" from the pop-up menu halfway down the dialog:\n\nYou merely need to select 2 pages per sheet and will print a single page \"two up\" as they say. Note that if you have a two (or 3 or 4...) page document it will print page 1 and 2 on the first sheet of paper.\n", "Q: iPhone switching on when plugged in and I really don't want that Right. Short question. I have read previous threads about how it is a feature that the iPhone switches itself on when plugged in. To me it is more of a pain. I have an iPhone because that is the only option my employer offers and if I could have the damned thing switched off and tucked away in a drawer behind a cupboard in a landfill I would. It is an overpriced rubbish piece of equipment.\nIs there really no way of keeping it off when plugging it in? The bloody thing wakes me up in the middle of the night if I have forgotten to switch it off AGAIN after plugging it in.\n\nA: Plug it in, then turn it off. Has worked 100% of the time for me. You just have to get into the habit of doing this. Takes time and a little willpower.\n", "Q: MBAir to Chromebook? For the last 10 years I have been using a Macbook Air. Now I want to switch over to Chromebook.\nWhat types of challenges I may come across with regard to getting my saved folders and files in MBA and how do I access them in my Chromebook via my saved external disk?\n\nA: You have multiple options depending on your needs.\nThe most straight-forward option would be to format your external disk in the ExFAT format. This format is supported for both read and writes by both macOS and Chrome OS. It also supports large files, which is otherwise a problem with older versions of FAT.\nAnother option would be to format the external disk with HFS+. This format can be read and written to from macOS, and you can read the files from Chrome OS. You'll need to copy them over to other storage (internal/external) once on Chrome OS, as you will be able to only read the files - not write to them again on the HFS+ formatted disk.\n\nA: Because you'll be using the Google OS, which is integrated with the Google suite of services (Gmail, Google Docs, Calendar, etc) You might want to check out this page at Google for information. All modern Chromebooks use a USBC (Thunderbolt3) external device connection. You will need the latest version of Chrome installed. Here's a summary derived from this page:\nStep 1\nSign in to your Chrome browser\nFirst, grab your old Mac/Windows computer and make sure you're signed in to your Chrome browser with your Google account. This way all your bookmarks, passwords and settings will be saved for the switch.\nImport your settings from Safari or Internet Explorer.\nStep 2\nBack up your files\nFiles\nDownload Backup and Sync and sign in with your Google account. Then upload your files from your old computer and SD cards to safely store them in Google Drive. You can also back up your files to an external hard drive which you can later connect to your Chromebook.\nPhotos\nUpload your photos to Google Photos so you can instantly access them from your phone, tablet and Chromebook. Click the \"Upload newly added photos and videos to Google Photos\" option during Backup and Sync setup.\nMusic\nAdd your favorite music collections to Music Manager, so you can enjoy them on Google Play Music.\n", "Q: Adjust “home” address in Apple Maps without affecting Autofill, etc When I ask Siri to “direct me home,” I really mean that I want her to take me to my parking spot, which is about a block away from what Maps considers to be the location of my building.

Does aniPhone connected to a MacBook by USB, use power from USB or its own battery?\nI want to use the iPhone camera overhead for teaching art on Zoom. Answers to this kind of heavy tech question/research are necessary to avoid a $500-$1,000 iPhone purchase mistake.\nSimilarly, does iPhone streaming a Zoom class, use it's own storage space or that of the USB connected MacBook?\n\nA: The iPhone always draws its power from its own battery. However, when connected by USB to a MacBook Pro, it will at the same time charge the battery. So depending on your use-case, it is commonly possible to run the iPhone indefinitely in this mode. Remember to power the MacBook Pro from its charger, and ensure that the MacBook Pro is not so heavily taxed that it actually uses more power than the charger supplies.\nWhen using Zoom on an iPhone, any storage used would be on the iPhone itself - not on an USB-connected MacBook Pro. However, streaming a Zoom class doesn't really use up any storage worthwhile mentioning - unless you're recording it.\n", "Q: Spotlight won't index any of the standard built-in macOS apps.

We ran Etre Check on his machine and got back some info from mds, reporting that mdimporter was crashing, and it gave us a file id.\nI had him open up a terminal and put in sudo mdutil -t <number>. It came back with a path to an email. I had him open up that email (with open <path>), he reviewed the email, decided he didn't need it and deleted it.\nIIRC we had to repeat the process multiple times until mdimporter stopped choking on his files.

When I control-click on some files in the trash I see the \"Put Back\" menu item:\n\nHowever, on other files I don't see this item:\n\nWhy is that?\n\nA: You only see Put Back if a file/folder was deleted by the Finder, not any other process.\nIt will silently fail to Put Back if the folder it came from is gone, but it will still offer.\nTested on Mojave.\n", "Q: What makes Time Machine necessary if using iCloud? Does make sense to use Time Machine with external drive if I already have all my files stored in iCloud? What laptop information is Time Machine keeping that cannot be stored in iCloud?\n\nA: The key is the difference between a copy and a backup.\niCloud Drive is essentially an off-site copy of your data. That’s great — if your house burns down, you still have your files.\nBut it is not a backup of your data. Because if you were to (accidentally) delete a file from your iCloud Drive and then immediately have your house burn down, the file has gone forever.\nThe main property that backups have that a copy does not is that they can go back through time. Let’s say you edit really important file.txt and make a terrible mistake, but you don’t realise for a while what you’ve done. Next week you open it up and realise your mistake.\niCloud Drive doesn’t help you here: the mistake you made has synchronised to the cloud. But your backup has a version of the previous file that you should — depending on available space and your defined backup rotation scheme — be able to go back and retrieve.\nSimilarly in the case where you deleted a file and then your house burnt down, a backup that didn’t burn down along with the house will allow you to retrieve that file. (Point 4 below solves for this disaster. You could also store your Time Machine drive in the shed, at work, etc.)\nIdeally you should combine these technologies. The maximally ideal state is one where you end up with:\n\n*\n\n*A ‘local’ copy of your files that you work on every day. This is just your Mac.\n\n*An off-site synchronised copy of your files that you can retrieve very quickly if your Mac is offline, or that you can use for convenience, e.g. accessing your files from your iPad. This is iCloud Drive.\n\n*A local backup of your files that you can use to restore from very quickly. This is Time Machine.\n\n*An off-site backup of your files that you can use when your life goes terribly, terribly wrong. This is the ultimate insurance policy; you hope you’ll never actually need to use this. Something like Backblaze.\n\n\nA: Time Machine can, in theory, restore the exact state of your Mac at any time. All apps, prefs, settings, documents.\niCloud will restore only your documents. Everything else would need to be re-installed from scratch.\nWhether or not you consider that 'necessary' is your call.\n\nA: When planning your backup, you should always think about the worst-case scenario, and Time Machine can definitely fail (here's just one example among many).\nTime Machine doesn't contain a clone of your system. It merely hopes to be able to restore a clone of your system, by applying incremental backups one after the other and by juggling with non-standard hard-links for folders.\nSo iCloud + Time Machine is not a sufficient, reliable backup strategy. You should have a real clone on an external drive, and this drive shouldn't be in the same location as your computer and Time Machine drive. (See 3-2-1 rule)\nOne advantage of using a complete clone (e.g. with Carbon Copy Cloner, among others) is that you can boot from it and check if everything works fine. With Time Machine, you typically only run a restore when you really need it.\n\nA: Yes Time Machine is needed even if you have iCloud. iCloud is not a backup system it is synchronisation.\nTime Machine makes a copy of your file so it is in two places and if you delete one then the other is still there\niCloud makes the file available in several places but if you delete it in one then it is deleted in all places.\nAlso Time Machine copies all files on your disk and iCloud only syncs a few folders.\n\nA: iCloud is not a backup.  Apple tells you it is not a backup.  There is no way to easily backup files that are kept only in iCloud.\nSo if your data doesn't actually matter... sure, keep it only in iCloud.\n\nA: You don't need either Time Machine or iCloud.\nFor backup:\n\n*\n\n*You can use an alternate means for network backup: I use Carbonite for instance.\n\n*You can just do \"plain old\" on-site backup.  I use 'rsync' set up by custom perl scripts to iterate on each drive, manage exclusions, etc.\n\nFor version control:\n\n*\n\n*You could do that \"old school\" by rotating backup \"tapes\" (USB sticks), like we used to do with exabyte tapes and servers. You have a daily rotation of typically 5 tape sets... then at intervals you pull one of those out as a quasi \"monthly\" and just store it forever.  Just as well, since the tapes had limited life.  Do that with USB sticks.  I would note: back then, nobody could hold a company hostage by \"ransomware\", you would just bag the hard drives for evidence, slap in new hard drives, and restore from a sufficiently old backup.\n\n*You could use somebody else's versioning software.\n\n*You don't need to use versioning backup at all if you don't want to.\n\n", "Q: Can I add the 2nd monitor with Apple Cinema display I have a MBP 2017 13\" connected to a cinema display. Right now I'm looking for a 4K 60hz display with USBC for charging my MBP. In that case, can both monitors work? I connect to the Cinema Display with an adapter.\n\nA: Yes this usually does work. Connecting another monitor with PD (Power-delivery) should not change the behaviour on your other ports. Your MacBook's specs specifically mention the ability to support two 4K monitors @60Hz, so one with a lower resolution will be no problem. I myself have been using a 4K PD (USB-C) LG monitor and a 2K monitor connected through a hub on a 2017 15\" MBP.\nHowever, your graphics card needs to push many more pixels, i.e. other graphics related tasks may slow down depening on your usecase.\n\nJust to clarify:\n\nConnecting another monitor [..] should not change the behaviour on your other ports\n\nOf course your MacBook is limited at some point, i.e. connecting daisychained TB (Thunderbolt) devices and using an integrated USB hub in a monitor (many monitors using USB-C have this) will at some point lead to lower performance on these devices. However, you should only see decreasing speeds e.g. for external drives connected like that but the video output should generally be prioritized, i.e. not limited due to more connected other devices.\n", "Q: Google Chrome caused Mac OS X to have High CPU \nI'm not sure if anyone else faced this issue also. My Mac Book running so hot. I'm on the latest OS BigSur, and on a MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019). As you can this Mac is fairly new and fully loaded. It's kind of sad when it's hot over an app like Chrome, and Apple technician can't find anything wrong it while I brought it to the store twice.\nI'm using the default charger that it came with the 16\" (96W).\nI reinstalled OS twice by me, and by Apple.

Is there a way to find out ?\nNote\n\nWhen I closed Chrome, my Mac is not hot or loud anymore, so Chrome seem to be the major caused in my case.\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem. A new MacBook Pro was still (after a couple of weeks) running too damn hot. And Chrome was, seemingly, not using a lot of CPU or RAM. And still there were a number of articles and forum posts about how Chrome is still the root of all of this evil.\nBeing the skeptical type I left Chrome alone. But the heat issue was still there and nothing else was fixing the issue. So I followed some instructions on some web page, somewhere that had some detailed instructions for removing Chrome and all of its little background processes. Google it, you will find quite a few helpful places with detailed instructions.\nIn its place I installed Brave, which is based on Chrome but without all the tracking and auto updating and anything else Google could throw at it.\nIt worked.\nSo if you can do without Chrome itself and use Brave in its place you just may find that does the trick.\n", "Q: The process com.cisco.anyconnect.macos.acsockext hogs Mac CPU but cannot be killed or stopped from launching MacBookPro16,1 running Big Sur 11.3.1 (20E241)\nThis job consumes huge amounts of CPU off and on (see attached image from my Activity Monitor), often causing my laptop fans to engage to cool the processor.

This limitation is supposed to be removed by Apple at some point in the very near future.\n\nA: Personally, I had success from the following:\nNOTE: You will need Administrator access on your Mac to accomplish these instructions\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor\n\n*Kill the running process\n\n*Open Network Prefs\n\n*Remove all instances of it with the [-] button, and click apply\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Change permissions on the application Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter.app\n\n    cd /Applications/Cisco\n    sudo chmod 0644 \"./Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter.app\"\n    sudo chown ${USER}:staff \"./Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter.app\"\n    exit\n\nThis will change ownership of the app to your personal account, and alter its permissions such that your account can read or write to it, but nobody, including you or the system groups, and execute it. It's a paperweight.\nBut since my company has a script that verifies its existence (even if it can't run it itself or it's not running at that moment) I don't care to delete it and have to explain myself.\nIt does not impact my AnyConnect/ability to access the corporate VPN whatsoever, doesn't trip any red flags with CorpSec (YMMV), and persists after reboot.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I'm using AnyConnect 4.10.x on Big Sur 11.5.1. What worked for me was simply to not allow Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter from loading system software (there would be a prompt in System Preferences > Security and Privacy) when you install AnyConnect.\nThe VPN client still works without a problem, and it seems the Socket Filter thing isn't really necessary anyways, except for the Filter Network Content feature the comment above mentioned.\n\nA: In Finder, control click on the Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter, and select Show Package Contents.

When browsing using Google Chrome on OS X Catalina I out of nowhere got a system pop-up saying \"Google Chrome wants access to control Finder\" and asking me whether I want to allow that or not. Haven't found any good answers online. Is this normal or should I be worried about malware?\n\nA: \nIs this normal or should I be worried about malware?\n\nI'd say it's not unusual that apps ask for additional access to the file system or permissions to control other apps, and you shouldn't be worried about malware, but that doesn't mean you have to blindly accept such requests.\nI recommend that you ponder carefully whether to grant them by answering these three questions:\n\n*\n\n*Do you understand what is requested?\n\n*Was the request triggered by user interaction (like launching the app, saving a document to disk or starting an Automator Quick Action)?\n\n*Does the app require the requested access for normal or desired operation?\nIf you can't answer all questions with \"yes\", be wary of granting the permission. (Note that this is not a bullet-proof security checklist, but a rule of thumb that has helped me in the past, so I share it here).\nLet me give you some real-life examples:\n\n*\n\n*VMware Fusion, an app that let's you run virtual machines, asks at launch for access to the system's accessibility features, so I ask: \n\n*\n\n*Do I understand what is requested?\nYes, by requesting access to accessibility features, the app can control my  Mac. That's quite a lot to ask, although VMware nicely documents why some of their apps need it. \n\n*Was the request triggered by user interaction?\nYes, when launching the app.\n\n*Does the app require the requested access for normal or desired operation?\nAfter declining the request I don't notice any performance issues, so the answer is no and I won't grant access in future requests.\n\n\n\n*The Terminal app requests access to my Desktop folder when running a shell script, so I ask:\n\n*\n\n*Do I understand what is requested?\nYes, if I let Terminal access my Desktop, it will be able to read all files and folders on my Desktop, including the script I'm about to run.\n\n*Was the request triggered by user interaction?\nYes, when running the script.\n\n*Does the app require the requested access for normal or desired operation?\nYes, because I trust the shell script and need it to process files on the Desktop, so I grant access.\n\n\n\nAs you see, there are no \"right\" answers, they depend on your use case, but  a healthy dose of mistrust doesn't harm.\n\nIs there anything you would recommend to make sure my system is safe?\n\nIn the context of downloading and running apps, these three questions will help to keep your system safe:\n\n*\n\n*Is the app made available on the Mac App Store or on the the developer's website of a reputable developer?\n\n*If a website asks you to download an app, is it simply providing a link to the developer's website?\n\n*Is the app supported?\nIf you can answer all questions with \"yes\", you are most probably on the safe side.\nAgain, let me give you a real-life example:\n\n*\n\n*After clicking a link on an e-commerce website some days ago, I came across this page:\n\nThe page claims you need Adobe Flash Player to continue and insistently asks you to download from one of the offered links, so I ask:\n\n*\n\n*Is the app made available on the Mac App Store or on the the developer's website?\nNo, it's not, this is not Adobe's Flash Player download page.\n\n*If a website asks you to download an app, is it simply providing a link to the developer's website?\nNo, the link provided doesn't point to Adobe.\n\n*Is the app supported?\nA quick Google/DuckDuckGo search leads to this end-of-life information page on Adobe's website, which makes it clear the developer doesn't support it anymore so you don't download anything and remain safe.\n\n(In case you're wondering, this is an actual phishing website which I reported to Amazon AWS through their report abuse form.)\n", "Q: macOS \"Verifying Microsoft [Excel/Word/Powerpoint].app\" over and over again Here's the problem I'm having with Microsoft Office apps:\n\nI see this dialog several times a month when I launch Microsoft Word/Excel/Powerpoint.\nVery frequently, the verification process hangs, and I need to force-quit.\nEven when it succeeds, it often takes several minutes or more.\nWorse yet, even after it succeeds, it's often only a matter of a few days or weeks before macOS seems to need to reverify the app again. (I.e., if the Mac is \"whitelisting\" the app once it successfully verifies it - that whitelist only lasts for a few days or weeks).\nNeedless to say, this is extremely annoying.\nI appreciate that MacOs is trying to keep my computer safe from malicious viruses and programs. However, is there a way to ensure that, once whitelisted, a program can remain whitelisted?\nIn case it's relevant, I'm running macOS Big Sur (v. 11.2.3), and v. 16.49 of the Microsoft Office for Mac apps.\n\nA: Press Command + Space and type terminal and press enter .\nThen type these commands :\nsudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/app\n\nTo find path of your app just simply drag the app to terminal .\nPress enter and run this command too .\nsudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app\n\nPress enter .\n", "Q: Is there a way to make terminal commands require sudo in macOS Big Sur? I'd like to prevent the use of the osascript terminal command by anyone without administrator access. I used to accomplish this by changing the permissions on the executable using sudo chmod 744 /usr/bin/osascript.\nThe problem now (from what I understand) is that Big Sur does not allow changes to be made to the read-only system volume. I'd therefore like to find a workaround that retains this functionality ie. I don't want it to be possible to run this binary without the use of sudo.\nThis has been a huge thorn in my side, and I don't want to have to resort to disabling SSV authentication in order to edit the system volume. If there's any way to just elevate the permissions needed then that would be perfect.\n\nA: Changing the permissions on the binary is not going to be an effective way of blocking such commands. The user can simply download or copy the osascript binary from a web site or another computer onto your Mac and run it - without sudo.\nThere's probably some resource that you do not want your users to access - and they have been doing that through the osascript command. But instead of blocking osascript, look at changing the permissions for that resource. That would in turn make it so that osascript cannot access it without sudo.\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur - gatekeeper? slowing down opening applications At a facility where I work, we have several Mac Pros and Mac Minis.\nWe're in need to upgrade from Mojave to Big Sur so we can upgrade our various production tools, i.e. Pro Tools, DaVinci Resolve Studio.\nAs a test, I installed Big Sur from scratch on MacPro (trashcan model), and it appears that if the computer detects any kind of connection either wireless or wired, it tries to contact some apple servers, this happens every time we open third-party applications. The problem is that that our wired mac computers do not have access to the internet, so just trying to open pro tools takes about 10 minutes. The app icon just bounces and bounces. Sometimes the app does not even open at all after bouncing for over 10 minutes.\nI found out that Big Sur is trying to contact apple servers because that's what it shows in our firewall's logs. These are the servers:\nussjc2-vip-bx-001.aaplimg.com,\nussjc2-vip-bx-002.aaplimg.com,\nussjc2-vip-bx-003.aaplimg.com,\nussjc2-vip-bx-004.aaplimg.com,\nussjc2-vip-bx-005.aaplimg.com,\nussjc2-vip-bx-006.aaplimg.com,\nussjc2-vip-bx-007.aaplimg.com,\nussjc2-vip-bx-008.aaplimg.com\nSo basically it tries to connect to the first server, then it waits, when it does not get a reply, it tries the second server, and so forth.\nIf this even after we opted out of any analytics, but then again, this wouldn't be the first time software developers get caught doing something they're not supposed to do.\nAny idea what's might be going on or how to disable this behavior?\nCheers!\nSuperVertix\n\nA: You absolutely want to open up all outbound ports to the entire 17.0.0.0/8 address block which is assigned to Apple as a first step.\nNext, get this article to your network and security teams.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210060\nIf they balk, call your Apple store (or whomever you buy you Macs) and ask for a short call with Apple Business to sort out why doing all of the things is the best plan for speed and security.\nIf your team isn’t convinced this is correct, set up a new network segment and do some A / B testing. Apple has made some very nice optimizations so notarization, certificate validation and other checks are cached very well now. Some even work with a proxy but some will not tolerate any manner of proxy or deep inspection / manipulation of the traffic.\n", "Q: 2015 MacBook Air: Internal SSD Is Locked and Can't erase/update Have Early 2015 11\" MacBook Air, with original 128GB SSD installed.

I have a Macbook Air (2015). It has two identical USB ports, one on the left and one the right.\nI bought two identical USB flash drives and plugged both in. I'm copying a single large dataset onto both drives. The first transfer is complete, the second has just begun and will take another hour. I would like to disconnect the drive that I've already transferred the files to. I obviously do not want to disconnect the wrong drive, the drive with an active file transfer. But these drives do not have any kind of activity indicator (like an LED).\nSo, which drive is which? If the physical devices offer no clue, can I figure this out by consulting fstab or some other low-level system info? Do the physical ports have predictable locations on the internal bus, or anything like that?\nI don't expect an answer within the next hour, but I'm still interested in the question academically. When the two USB devices are different, it's easy to know which is which because you put them there and are aware of their differences.\nAlso: this question is specific to 2015 Macbook Airs.

Neither did I check whether the same is true for a Window Capture Device or perhaps even a Browser source, but I guess in many cases pointing to OBS will be enough of an explanation.\nI would assume that other apps might trigger the message in similar ways as OBS but I'll leave it to others to identify those apps in separate answers.\n", "Q: Let me understand the Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports of the new iMac The top model of the new iMac to be launched by the end of May 2021, is said to come with 2 Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports and 2 USB 3 ports.\nIn my mind, Thunderbolt is a physically different connector compared to the other 2 USB 3 ports, but looking at this picture they are apparently the same port.\nI have an old 2012 iMac connected to two external TVs through the thunderbolt port. Each port using a thunderbolt to HDMI dongle. I am not mirroring the main screen. I have 3 independent monitors, the iMac one and each TV.\nSo I thought, I could do the same to this new iMac. I disconnect the dongles I have on the old iMac and connect to this new one but apparently these \"thunderbolt\" ports of the new iMac are in fact USB-C ports that deliver thunderbolt. So, In fact I need USB-C to HDMI dongles, right?\nSo, physically speaking, this new iMac only has 4 USB-C ports, two of them being able to deliver \"thunderbolt\", right?\nThis new iMac has two of these \"thunderbolt\" ports but apparently if I use both, I will not get two external independent monitors right?\nWhy?\n\nA: There's actual more than one version of Thunderbolt - this seem to be the thing that confuses you regarding the connectors.\nThunderbolt (1st generation) which you have on your old iMac uses the same connector as mini-DisplayPort.\nThunderbolt 3, which is on the new iMac, uses the USB-C connector.\nThen there's the matter of signalling protocols. The same signalling protocol can potentially be used on several different connectors. This seems to be the source of your confusion on the USB connectors.\nThunderbolt 3, USB 4 and USB 3 signals can run through the same type of connector - namely the USB-C connector.\nHowever, it is also possible to run USB 3 over other connectors, such as the most common USB-A connector that you know from your old iMac.\nYou're right in that you cannot reuse your old display cables. These were actually not Thunderbolt to HDMI dongles, but rather mini-DisplayPort to HDMI. The new iMac uses a different connector, so they cannot be reused.\nFor the new iMac you need a USB-C to HDMI cable. You can also use an adapter/dongle and reuse an existing HDMI-to-HDMI cable for the long run of the cable.\nThe reason you do not get to connect two external, independent monitors is simply that the graphics processing unit in the iMac does not support more than 2 displays - the internal display and a single external monitor. It is not a limitation with the Thunderbolt/USB-C connector, nor is it a limitation with Thunderbolt signalling or anything like that. It is simply the GPU that does not support more displays.\n", "Q: Unable to reinstall MacOS Mojave on a hardware modified, mid-2012 MacBook Pro I decided to reinstall Mojave onto a mid-2012 MacBook Pro that I purchased second hand in June 2020 & modified some of the internals of*. I have a lot of files from previous backups of files as well as from the last time I used Windows in 2018, & it was beginning to get a bit glitchy. While I did follow the instructions on the Apple website to make a bootable USB stick with Mojave on it with Terminal, I don’t think that I formatted the USB correctly.\nIt also gives me an error that says “This copy of the Install macOS Mojave application is damaged and can’t be used to install MacOS.”\nThe previous owner had installed Catalina onto it, but I’m also an artist who needs 32-bit app support. Last year, I managed to get a USB stick with Mojave on it working (I currently don’t have access to it), but I’m beginning to think that’s why I can’t reinstall Mojave.\nTerminal tells me it’s on Bash version 3.2. I’ve tried internet recovery (which has never worked with this machine), & changing the date to some time not long after Mojave’s original release date.\nI’m at a complete loss.\n*I replaced the original, failing 750GB HDD with a 2TB SSD; replaced broken super-drive with a SATA adaptor & a 1TB SSD; increased RAM to 16GB; replaced depleted battery with fresh one. I didn’t buy them all at once.\n\nA: I managed to solve it myself by going into recovery mode, trying but failing to install Mojave, then going to Disk Utility, view > show all volumes, having some files that said something to the effect of “EAS install files” (I can’t quite remember the name) burned to one of the internal SSDs. I then exited Disk Utility, went Apple Logo > Start-up Disk, & booted it up from one of the SSDs.\nIt then reinstalled fine, but it took about 6 hours in total.\n", "Q: How can I make preview stop wrapping around when paging? If I open a PDF document in Preview and navigate through the pages normally using Page down and Page up, then if I hold down the keys to trigger auto-repeat, when I reach the bottom (or top) of the document, Preview wraps around and shows me the top (or bottom) again.  For example, if I press and hold Page down to page forward, then when it reaches the end of the document, it doesn't stop there; it starts back at the top, going around in a kind of loop.  The behavior only happens if I set my key repeat rate (in system preferences) to the maximum possible.\nWhat could cause this, and how can I prevent this from happening (short of reducing the keyboard repeat rate), so that Preview stops when it reaches the top or bottom of a document?\nThis is on macOS 10.13.6, on an iMac. This happens both with a Kinesis Pro keyboard and a bog-standard Dell USB keyboard; both have dedicated page up/down keys. In Preview settings, \"opening for the first time\" is set to continuous scroll. Example of a random PDF file where it happens: https://www.apple.com/procurement/pdf/impact-accelerator.pdf  Here is a video recording showing the behavior: https://share.getcloudapp.com/8LubXNo5\n\nA: As discovered, this issue currently only exists with Preview when the Key Repeat slider on the Keyboard tab of the Keyboard pane in System Preferences is set to Fast, where the slider is all the way to the right. By default it's one position from the right.\nThis is a workaround solution that sets the Key Repeat slider to the default position when Preview is activated, and to Fast when it's deactivated, (i.e. given/lost keyboard/mouse focus).\nIt uses the third-party application Hammerspoon along with a bit of Lua code to watch for Preview being activated/deactivated, and an AppleScript script using UI Scripting to adjust the Key Repeat slider on the Keyboard tab of the Keyboard pane in System Preferences.\nThe example Lua code and exampleAppleScript code, shown further below, was tested under macOS High Sierra and macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate setting in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility have been set/addressed as needed.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the download and install instructions assume Safari and default preference [√] Open “safe” files after downloading checked.\nDownload Hammerspoon\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/releases/latest\n\n\n*Click the Hammerspoon-n.n.nn.zip link.\n\n\nInstall Hammerspoon\n\n*\n\n*Open the Downloads folder and drag and drop the Hammerspoon application bundle into Applications.\n\n\n*Before you open Hammerspoon, add it to: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\nOpen Hammerspoon from Applications or Spotlight, then:\nFrom the Hammerspoon menu,  on the menu bar, click it, then click Preferences…, and set them as follows:\nHammerspoon Preferences\nBehavior:\n\n*\n\n*[√] Launch Hammerspoon at login\n\n*[√] Check for updates\n\n*[ ] Show dock icon\n\n*[√] Show menu icon\n\n*[ ] Keep Console window on top\n\n*[ ] Send crash data (requires restart)\nAccessibility: Accessibility is enabled.

It's running the AppleScript script to change the position of the Key Repeat slider on the Keyboard tab of the Keyboard pane in System Preferences. This on my system takes less than a second. If I can find a way to programmatically behind the scene make this change without having to use UI Scripting with AppleScript I will update the code and notify the OP.\nThere is an issue with this workaround when manually clicking on System Preferences in the Dock when Preview is frontmost. To manually open System Preferences from the Dock when Preview is frontmost you need to set focus away from Preview first before clicking on System Preferences in the Dock. The behavior when Preview is frontmost and  manually trying to open System Preferences from the Dock results in System Preferences being opened and closed, bouncing on the Dock, without further user interaction. (I'll see what I can do to resolve this issue, although I think it's a nature of the beast type bug that one will just need to be aware of and live with for the benefit of what this solution provides.)\nI am not affiliated with the developers of Hammerspoon, just a satisfied user of the product.\n\n\nNote: The example Lua and AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted.\n", "Q: What kind of performance can I expect from Mid 2015 Macbook pro connected to two external 4k displays -- I mostly do development?

I'm using the Packages app to create an installer which includes, among other things, a launchd job.\nThe postinstall Bash script needs to target the logged in user as follows:\nlaunchctl bootstrap gui/$UID ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mycompany.myproduct.plist\n\nThe problem is that $UID returns 0 when run from within the package.\nThe following tweak works as expected on my machine but the target deployment users don't use 501 but mobile accounts so the UID differs with each AD account\nlaunchctl bootstrap gui/501 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mycompany.myproduct.plist\n\nI've tried all sorts of things:\n$SUDO_USER\n$LOGNAME\n$(who -m | awk '{print $1;})\n$(logname 2>/dev/null || $SUDO_NAME)\n\nAll return the 0/root user.\nThis seems to work, on my machine, when run it Terminal after sudo su.

The question is just whether this user is the one, you're looking for. In general, it will work - but you might see a different behaviour than you're expecting when users are also logged in via Remote Desktop. In that case, the last login performed will be returned (i.e. when multiple user's are logged in at the same time).\nThere's also a different method of getting the currently logged in user by asking the System Configuration Daemon:\nscutil <<< \"show State:/Users/ConsoleUser\" | awk '/Name :/ && ! /loginwindow/ { print $3 }'\n\nThe difference between the two is that looking at /dev/console cannot distinguish between root being logged in (i.e. root logins have been enabled by the user), or the computer being sat at the login window - both will return root as the owner of the file. Whether or not this is a problem for you depends on your specific use-case.\n", "Q: How share folder in QEMU with plan9/virtfs between MacOS host and Linux guest?

I have a VPN server running on my home network that I can connect to fine. The local IP subnet is set to 10.0.0.1 with the subnet mask set to 255.255.255.0. This works fine.\nWhen I'm on a friends network, they have the IP subnet set to the same value as mine. In this case I can connect to my VPN fine (doing an IP check online shows my home IP), but I'm unable to connect to any local device.\nIf the friend changes their router settings to use 192.168.1.1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, everything works perfectly (and I'm able to connect to my local devices on my home network).\n\nIt almost seems like when the IP subnet is the same, there is a conflict where it will prioritize sending it to the local network instead of sending it through to my VPN connection. I have verified that all of my traffic is set to send over the VPN connection.\n\n\nIs there a way on macOS to fix that so that no matter the local IP DNS subnet of the network I'm connected to I'm able to access my local devices on the VPN network?\n\nA: In your Mac's network settings, the local network is probably set to 10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0, this means that all IP addresses from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.255 are local. The option \"Send all traffic over VPN connection\" does not help here because it affects only non-local traffic.\nWhat you might try (but I would not recommend it) is to change your Mac's network setup to manual, then change the network mask, so only your friend's router is left in the local network. Assuming the router has 10.0.0.1, then the mask should change to 255.255.255.254 to route all other IP addresses through the VPN. Note that this makes it impossible to reach any other device in the local network. Note also that this setting cannot work when you are back in your own network. Finally, note also that this is a theoretical solution which I haven't tried, and it may well be that it causes other problems that I'm not thinking of.\nThe correct and recommended solution would be that you change the IP range of your local network to something more unusual that is unlikely to collide with other local networks, like for example 10.99.111.0/255.255.255.0. This is how I solved this problem, and I've never had any network collisions any more, even though I've used VPN from many different networks in other companies, hotels etc.\n", "Q: Cannot connect 2 different monitors through separate usb c cables I've tried everything.\nMy setup is:\n1 x MacBookPro 15\" 2017\n2 x Philips Brilliance 279P1/00\nI'm trying to connect both of them through the USB C cables they came with.\nI can only connect one at a time.\nBefore you suggest, yes I've tried everything that can be found through google searches and searches on this stackexchange:\n\n*\n\n*clicking on Detect Displays\n\n*turning the power on/off on external monitor\n\n*keeping my macbook through a separate charger\n\n*going in sleep mode\n\n*upgrade to Big Sur\n\n*not sleeping enough\n\n\nA: I have a similar setup with a 16\" MacBook Pro 2019 and similarly experienced that only one of the two Philips can be connected by USB-C to USB-C cable for its DisplayPort.\nI have to connect the other Philips using a USB-C to DisplayPort cable or USB-C to HDMI cable.

I've got a late-2014 27-inch Retina iMac with a 3TB fusion drive. It's at my workplace, which I haven't been to in over a year as I write this in mid-2021. For various reasons, the machine needed the disk to be reformatted and have macOS reinstalled, which was done in person by a very helpful IT person at work. It is currently at macOS Big Sur 11.3.1.\nHowever, for reasons that are opaque to me, the IT person seems to have formatted the main system data volume (MacHD - Data, which is mounted as /System/Volumes/Data) as Case-Sensitive APFS. This is certainly not the default, although it hasn't given me any issues that I know about. (Indeed, I only realised it because I ran homebrew's brew doctor command which informed me.)\nSo:\n\n*\n\n*Should I be worried?\n\n*Is there anything I can do about it short of wiping the disk and reformatting yet again (which I am loathe to do for obvious reasons).\n\nUpdate: I have discovered that at least one piece of software that I occasionally use does not work: Microsoft’s OneDrive — I can’t put the synced folder on a case-sensitive volume.

I rely on Google Drive file stream for my work and I have so far managed to successfully install the program. However, it seems I am having problems indexing the drive with Spotlight. Spotlight does not automatically index the drive, and I need to run: sudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/GoogleDrive/ every time I boot the machine up. It takes a while to index the 80 gigabyte drive and then it works as I like it. The only problem is that when I restart the machine it appears the index is gone and when I run sudo mdutil -s /Volumes/GoogleDrive/ it indicates that indexing is disabled. I'm hoping there's a workaround where the index will stick around so I don't have to enable it and wait everytime I boot the machine up.\nThere are separate instructions for installing GDFS on an M1 Mac, but since my install worked pretty seamlessly I didn't boot into recovery mode or anything like it suggests in there. I'm wondering if allowing user management of kernel extensions will help this problem, as I'd rather not tamper too much with this work computer.\n\nA: I hope this helps someone.\nGoogle Drive v59 has this option:\n\"Spotlight integration\nWhen this is enabled, search text you enter in Spotlight will be sent to Google in order to find matching Drive files\nEnable Spotlight to search streaming files\"\nI had to check this under Preferences (gear), Settings (gear) per account.\n\n\nA: This was driving me insane as well, and I was prepared to try setting up a cron to run the workaround python script from @emersonford (which looks great and thank you btw), but I think I may have found a better solution for my needs.\nI noticed in GoogleDrive preferences under Google Drive > My Drive syncing options if you change from Stream to Mirror, and then choose a local folder (I did ~/gd), spotlight appears to index all the files!\n\nI just now turned this on and it appears to work so far, fingers crossed it continues.\n\nA: I know that most of you are interested in solving the problem when streaming Google Drive's content (\"Stream Files\" option on in 'Settings', see @kortina's screenshot).\nBut for those of you (like me) who ended up reading this post because Spotlight won't index your Drive folder despite using the \"Mirror Files\" option, the solution is simple: follow these directions and reboot.\nEdit: here's the instructions:\nGo to System Preferences/ Spotlight. Click the Privacy tab.\nDrag the Google Drive folder to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Wait a moment and then click the remove button (–) to remove it from the list.\nQuit System Preferences. Spotlight will now start indexing the folder, which you can verify looking at the active processes in Activity Monitor. When it's done, give your Mac a nice reboot.\nWorked for me, will work for you!\n\nA: Here's a step by step workaround for Google Drive v49 (might not work in future versions):\n\n*\n\n*Quit Google Drive (click on the Google Drive icon in the menu bar, then click on the cogwheel, then click Quit).\n\n*Save this file somewhere as change_gdrive_smb_port.py (ex: curl -LO https://gist.githubusercontent.com/emersonford/85cc74f7f90c81d1b75c3c246124591d/raw/442834222e2aaa2be61badb6e84f53183ee10624/change_gdrive_smb_port.py).\n\n*Read over the script yourself so you know it's safe to run.\n\n*Run this script with python3 change_gdrive_smb_port.py. It will give you some prompts when it has found an account and to what port to change that account's SMB port to. These ports should be unused ports on your system.\n\n*Relaunch Google Drive.\n\n*Run the mdutil -i on command the script spits out.\n\n*Give Spotlight some time to index everything in Google Drive. It should now stay enabled!\n\nIf my script happens to break Google Drive or if you want to reset this change, all you need to do is remove core_feature_config from ~/Library/Application Support/Google/DriveFS/<ACCOUNT_NUM> and restart Google Drive.\nEDIT: This isn't as permanent as I thought. It looks like Google can remotely push changes to the \"feature_config\" file, which they've been doing once a day by the looks of it. When they push out changes, it ends up overwriting the changes my script made to core_feature_config...\nAt a minimum, you can always rerun the script and restart Google Drive (chain it together with pkill \"Google Drive\" && sleep 5 && echo \"yes\\n[PORT_NUM]\" | python3 change_gdrive_smb_port.py && open /Applications/Google\\ Drive.app). It's not great, but it preserves the Spotlight index database so you don't have to wait / waste CPU cycles on reindexing everytime.\nI'll update this again if I find a workaround!\nTechnical explanation\n\nGoogle Drive used to use a custom FUSE implementation called DriveFS on macOS which appears to have had Spotlight indexing support built in. It appears -- and this is all speculation on my part as I'm not a Google employee -- they had a lot of trouble bringing this over to the new M1 Macs based on this article. Even without that, FUSE implementations tend to be really hairy to maintain, so I wouldn't blame them for wanting to move off of it.\nI assume that as part of their Google Drive streaming for everyone roll-out, they wanted to ensure everyone could run Google Drive without mucking with kernel extensions, so they appear to have migrated the Google Drive filesystem to a Samba server implementation, then mount that with macOS's built in Samba client (hence why you now see 'localhost' mounted in Network). Kind of clever if you ask me!\nNow, the problem with this for Spotlight is two-fold. First, Apple now defaults to disabling Spotlight on network drives (likely with good reason), thus you now have to manually enable Spotlight on Google Drive.\nSecond, Google Drive sets the Samba server's port binding to -1, which means the OS picks a random available port for you. I'm not sure when this changed, but Spotlight no longer places its index in the root folder with the name Spotlight-V100. All Spotlight indexes are now stored in /var/db/Spotlight-V100; further, for network drives, that index is named something like smb%3A%2F%2FDRIVE@localhost%3A59999%2FGoogle%2520Drive. If you look closely, the port number of the network drive is part of the Spotlight index name. This is why Spotlight indexing seems to disable itself after some time. When Google Drive remounts the FS (sometimes randomly, sometimes on network disconnects), it's likely it got a new port from the OS to bind to. So to Spotlight, this looks like an entirely different network drive you haven't enabled Spotlight indexing on, thus you have to not only reenable indexing, but also wait for Spotlight to index everything all over again.\nI dug around the logs (in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/DriveFS/Logs) and noticed this in the start up section:\n2021-07-22T18:12:33.759ZI [6139763:CrBrowserMain] global_features_manager.cc:266:CompositeAll Composited global features *WITHOUT* overrides: drive_dot: true\n...\nmac_smb_port: -1\n...\n\nso it seems changing the SMB port to a static port is a preference, just got to figure out where. It took me a little bit to find this as it doesn't appear to be a plist setting, but using strings, I was able to deduce it was in core_feature_config which I discovered to be a binary file in the protobuf format. So just had to find the right field and replace the mac_smb_port value with what I wanted (with the right protobuf encoding). Once I figured that out with the right script, Spotlight has been stable for me since!\nDon't anticipate this will be an issue for much longer though, so if you aren't comfortable using my script and are willing to wait, I think you can sit tight. Either the Google Drive folks will add a static port number (or setting) to fix this issue or they'll migrate to using the built-in File Provider API (which I discovered you can enable right now by changing a different flag in core_feature_config), which will likely have better Spotlight support built in.\n\nA: For Alfred App users (like me: recommended!) there is an easy workaround: https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/guides-and-tutorials/google-drive-workflow/ - I am still trying to make it work, but apparently others have no problem setting it up and making it to work.\n", "Q: Parallels Desktop: Option not available: \"Install macOS Using the Recovery Partition\" \n*\n\n*I'm on a Mac Mini M1 with Big Sur 11.3.1\n\n*Fresh trial install of Parallels Desktop 16.5.0 Pro Edition\n\n*I'm not seeing the option \"Install macOS Using the Recovery Partition\", as described in their KB article.\n\n\nMy screen looks like this:\n\n\nA: Parallels support chat told me that macOS vm's are not (yet) supported on M1 processors.\nI should follow https://kb.parallels.com/125053.\n", "Q: Plain text agenda formatting recognition by Siri I will be hosting a small conference and want to send an email to participants containing a full agenda as plain text or in form of a short pdf as an attachment.\nI wanted to format it that way that Siri would recognize every individual event on the list and suggest adding it to the calendar.\nUnfortunately, I cannot find any description for formatting.\nUsually, I do it in that way:\n\nStart date/time - End date/time  | Event 1 Title | Event 1 Speaker | Event 1 Location | Event 1 Description\nStart date/time - End date/time  | Event 2 Title | Event 2 Speaker | Event 2 Location | Event 2 Description\n\nbut in that case, Siri is only recognizing starting date and leaves the rest empty (same case for pdf).\nDoes anybody know where can I find text formatting schemas for Siri to fully recognize events and allow adding them to the calendar?\n\nA: I do not really understand why Siri should be involved?\nFirst create a new calendar (click on the “File” menu, select “New Calendar” and then “iCloud”).

Could someone help show me what I'm doing wrong?\nWhen I tried to look up the error code number at the bottom, it didn't give me much insight.\nValid\ntell application \"Finder\"\n        delete (every item of folder \"Macintosh HD:Users:sme0219:Pictures:Camera\" whose name contains \".png\")\nend tell\n\nInvalid\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set userName to name of current user\n    set compName to name of startup disk\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    delete (every item of folder compName & \":Users:\" & userName & \":Pictures:Camera\" whose name contains \".png\")\nend tell\n\nError Report\n\nerror \"Can’t get {folder \"Applications\" of startup disk of application \"Finder\", folder \"Library\" of startup disk of application \"Finder\", folder \"System\" of startup disk of application \"Finder\", folder \"Users\" of startup disk of application \"Finder\", \":Users:\", \"sme0219\", \":Pictures:Camera\"} whose name contains \".png\".\" number -1728\n\n\nA: You need to put parentheses around:\ncompName & \":Users:\" & userName & \":Pictures:Camera\"\n\nExample:\n(compName & \":Users:\" & userName & \":Pictures:Camera\")\n\nThis concatenates everything within the parentheses as the full path, otherwise Finder just sees:\ndelete (every item of folder compName & \":Users:\" & userName & \":Pictures:Camera\" whose name contains \".png\")\n\nAs:\nget every item of folder \"Macintosh HD\"\n\nNot the entire path.\nSo, this works:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set userName to name of current user\n    set compName to name of startup disk\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    delete (files of folder (compName & \":Users:\" & userName & \":Pictures:Camera\") whose name contains \".png\")\nend tell\n\n\n\nInstead of relying on System Events to get that information, you can use the path to (folder) convention to ascertain its path, e.g.:\nset targetFolder to (path to pictures folder from user domain) & \"Camera\" as string\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    delete (files of folder targetFolder whose name contains \".png\")\nend tell\n\nPlease take a moment to read the linked document as I believe you'll find it quite informative.\nAlso note that since you stated code that deletes files in the OP and your code had the potential to delete a folder having a .png extension that every item  has bee changes to files with the exception of the line after \"otherwise Finder just sees:\" in this answer as that line is part of explaining what the issue is that you are having.\n\nA: This also works…\nproperty folderPath : (path to users folder from system domain as text)\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    delete (files of alias (folderPath & name of current user & ¬\n        \":Pictures:Camera:\") whose name contains \".png\")\nend tell\n\nNOTE This option deletes the files permanently and will not go to Trash.\n\nFWIW… I decided to use System Events to delete the ”.png” files because after testing the code with Finder deleting 400 “.png” files then with System Events moving 400 “.png” files to the .Trash folder… It took Finder 26 seconds to delete them all vs. System Events took 3 seconds to move them all to the .Trash folder (Rather than deleting them immediately, which took 1.3 seconds).\n\n\nYou may want to consider trying to get in the habit of using System Events, rather than Finder to handle commands that they both have in common.  Using Finder to process large amounts of items can often create huge bottlenecks when running your AppleScripts\n\nIn response to your question in the comment on this post,  this following code would do the job.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell current application to set userName to do shell script \"whoami\"\n    set compName to name of (startup disk)\n    set trashPath to (compName & \":Users:\" & userName & \":Pictures:Camera\")\n    delete (every file of folder trashPath whose name contains \".png\")\nend tell\n\nSystem Events doesn’t have an item class  to act on so you would need to use delete every file… Not delete every item…\n\nA: This is what I ended up doing with 100% success:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set userName to do shell script \"whoami\"\n    set compName to name of (startup disk)\n    set trashPath to (compName & \":Users:\" & userName & \":Pictures:Camera\")\n    delete (every item of folder trashPath whose name contains \".png\")\nend tell\n\n", "Q: rsync 3.2.3 keeps crashing on Mac mini M1 Trying to use rsync on a Mac mini M1 to backup from an external hard drive(formatted as APFS) to a NAS (shared as smb/cifs).

Not sure if it's related to rsync, or Big Sur, or M1 chip or the smb/cifs share etc. Any ideas? Seems pretty simple what I'm trying to do. Just back up my external drive to my NAS.\n\nA: Reverting back to the default macOS default version of rsync (2.6.9) resolved the issue.\n\nA: The rsync that Apple includes in Big Sur is rsync version 2.6.9 protocol version 29. It's from circa 2006.\nThe current version of rsync is rsync version 3.2.3 protocol version 31.\nYou can install it from Homebrew or MacPorts or try building it from source, if you want.\nBut it's no surprise that a 15-year-old tool is having issues. I assume there is some sort of licensing that prevents Apple from including a more up-to-date version of rsync with macOS.\nI would suggest installing a new version and trying again.\n\nA: This issue still exists, on the default shipping version of rsync, on Monterey 12.2. I’ve also found that the issue surfaces using ArqBackup targeting an SMB share for cloud backup.\nWhat happens for me before the total system crash, is that the network link itself actually crashes and shows as offline, prior to securityd segfaulting, and then a barrage of keychain password prompts. This culminates in an unexpected total system reset/restart.\nIn my case, I’ve completely uninstalled homebrew, and the issue still persists. Happens on both an M1 Mac Mini and an M1 MacBook Pro. Hoping to do some testing on an Intel MacBook Pro this weekend.\n\nA: I have Macbook M1 Pro (Mac OS Monterey 12.4), and switching from default rsync to brew rsync 3.2.4_1 worked for me. I gave the command,\nbrew install rsync\n\nand then located the location of the rsync binary installed (which was /opt/homebrew/Cellar/rsync/3.2.4_1/bin/rsync in my case) and used the same to download the files, and it worked perfectly.\n", "Q: Accessibility: How could I kill menu transparency improving legibility \nHow could I get rid of transparency on big sur?\n\nA: per Tetsujin answer is comments\n\n", "Q: Can't access external SATA HDD via enclosure Just bought EW7055 enclosure.\nWhen trying to connect to MacOS, I'm getting \"not readable by this computer\" error.\n\n\nTried with MacBook Air+Catalina and MacBook Pro+BigSur.\nSame result.\nHere is what I see in disk utility:\n\nAnd this is if I right click and \"Get Info\" on it:\n\nHere is the output of diskutil list:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         250.8 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +250.8 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD — data     192.2 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 25.3 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                525.8 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      3.2 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            11.4 GB    disk1s5\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                      Linux                         535.8 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                      Linux                         336.1 GB   disk2s5\n   3:                      Linux                         655.0 GB   disk2s6\n   4:                 Linux_Swap                         8.6 GB     disk2s7\n\nSeems like OS can see partitions, but for some reason can not give me an access to them.\nI've tried to boot with this enclosure, but MacBooks don't list the disk in StartUp disks.\nNeither in System Preferences nor when booting with Option pressed.\nIn Recovery Mode I've allowed to boot from any device and to any unsigned OS as well.\nI've found somewhat similar question, but I don't really understand what's the solution for that.\nUPDATE (GUESS):\nIs it just because MacOS can't read Linux file system format?\nBut then why can't I boot into it?\n\nSUB-UPDATE:\nOk, seems like Linux is not easily bootable on Mac hardware...\nIs that the answer? I just need to boot into OS which will be able to read Linux FS?\n\n\nA: Your \"Update (GUESS):\" is exactly correct macOS has no (native) ability to read/write filesystems common to Linux.\nHeck it can only READ NTFS file systems without 3rd party software.\nAlso you cant just plug a bootable Linux installation (Or Windows, for that matter) into a Mac and expect it to just boot.\nIt is possible to work with and install both Windows and Linux on Apple hardware. Apple offers Boot Camp software that enables Windows 10 to be installed and run. But with Linux you will have to seek out how to install Linux on your Mac.\nPeople here on AD may be able to help you with that. There are also lots of places online (mostly Linux-centric) that can help you install Linux on your Mac. But you cant just plug a Linux disk into your Mac and expect it to be bootable. Heck you need additional software just to read and write to the disk itself.\n\nA: Starting in 2015, Apple began eliminating from Intel Macs the firmware capable of BIOS booting operating systems. Since diskutil list shows a FDisk_partition_scheme, most likely you can only BIOS boot from the external drive.\nIf you objective is to access the Linux volumes, then this question has already been asked. See: How can I mount an ext4 file system on OS X?. I can add, that booting from an Ubuntu Live flash drive will probably allow you to mount and access Linux volumes on your external drive. Instructions for creating a Ubuntu live flash drive can be found at this Canonical website.\n", "Q: MacBook pro 16 inch 2019 keeps forgetting KVM settings I have a KVM setup that connects several computers to the same Keyboard (Kul ES-87) and Mouse (wireless logitech M525). My monitors are 24 inch, 1920x1200 resolution Dell (2412M and 2415). I connect an Ubuntu machine, one Late 2013 Macbook Pro and a brand new 2019 Macbook Pro 16 inch purchased last week (henceforth, just \"MBP 16\") for work to this KVM setup (IOGear GCS24U). The MBP16 has AMD Radeon Pro 5300M 4 GB\n& Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB and has the latest, updated software.\nThe Ubuntu and the Late 2013 MBP machines connect just fine to my KVM, and have had for years now, but the MBP16 has been extremely flaky with the KVM. The result of the flakiness: it doesn't recognize the VGA monitor (Dell U2412Mb) and after it fails, requires heavy-handed approaches (see below) to fix. I am not sure if these approaches are sustainable.\nI connect the two external monitors to the MBP16 in the following way using two separate USB-C ports on the MBP16:\n\n*\n\n*MBP16 port 1 -> Benfei USB-C 2 VGA -> KVM (VGA) -> (VGA) Dell 2412Mb // Mostly flaky\n\n\n*MBP16 port 3 -> Anker USB-C 2 DisplayPort -> (DisplayPort) Dell 2415 // Always works\n(MBP16 port 2 is used for a USB 2.0 hub for ethernet, mic, KVM mouse and keyboard; MBP16 port 4 is used for power.)\nI see that the MBP16 connects to the U2415, no problems ever noted. The VGA connection through the Benfei adapter and U2412Mb frequently is flaky (see definition of flaky below). It requires a combination of me switching the KVM port for the MBP16 or reconnecting the VGA on the KVM switch itself that makes the MBP16 recognize the U2412Mb again.\nWhat do I mean by flaky? It works fine so long as it was recognized: wakes up from sleep and re-recognizes the VGA display; after switching to another KVM port, re-recognizes the VGA display. However, if I remove the MBP16 and take it outside of the KVM world (e.g., work on sofa) and get it back, it forgets the VGA. And then it requires all kinds of heavy-handedness to re-recognize the VGA.\n\n*\n\n*I am not daisy chaining monitors through a hub (see connection description above).\n\n\n*I am running the latest OS on my MBP16 (11.3.1).\n\n\n*I have tried, instead of the Benfei USB-C adapter, (1) An apple-store purchased Belkin VGA to USB-C adapter (which did not work at all) (2) an Apple adapter to thunderbolt and then a thunderbolt to USB-C (didn't work at all); (3) a CableCreation multiadapter with Ethernet and VGA to USB-C (worked for 20 minutes). That said, I didn't try using a different KVM port when I tried approaches (1)--(3) above.  Also note, a direct connection from Benfei USB-C 2 VGA to the Dell 2412Mb works fine.\n\n\n*Last, but not the least, I tried both NVRAM and SMC reset multiple times, didn't do anything.\nWhat is the secret to appeasing the \"it just works\" Apple gods? Any insight is appreciated.\nPS: Post question rant: FWIW, I have noticed it never \"it just works\" with Apple gear. NFS, CIFS, Guest access, USB connections, USB-based Ethernet, iMessage forwarding, call forwarding to other Apple products, all of which, in my over-a decade experience, has never \"it just works\" and it always breaks from one release to another.\n\nA: The type-C-to-VGA converter cable did not pass the EDID feeding timing correctly to the VGA KVM switch or the VGA KVM switch did not pass or have VGA EDID emulation feeding to the shared monitor.\nPlease make sure your IO Gear VGA monitor provide Bi-directional EDID emulation and feeding fuction first. If IOgear did not support the EDID emulation, then you may need add an external VGA EDID emulator between the converter cable and the KVM switch.\n", "Q: Error while entering Apple ID (entered someone else's ID) My wife received a used iPhone and decided to set it up herself. I thought that there would be no problems: what could go wrong there? but everything turned out to be much more serious\nBriefly about the sequence of her actions:\n\n*\n\n*The old Owner has left iCloud.\n\n*Setup for FaceId, and entering the confirmation password(twice).\n\n*Next, enter iCloud - and here the epic fail happened. The wife switches to the numeric keypad and enters the password (6 digits) from step 2 :).\nThen he asks to enter the password for unlocking. The password that was set in step 2 is not suitable - it blocks when entered for 5/15 minutes. There is no way to go back to entering another AppleID.\nAs I understand it, at step two someone's real ID was entered (I just didn't know that you can enter it in the form of a 6-digit code) and now you need a password to unlock.\nThere is no password for this and there is no way to find it either.\n\ncan \"Recovery mode\" help me? if yes - is it not dangerous?\nor do I need to use dfu?\nWhat can be done in this situation?\nAny advice - I will be very grateful.\np.s. a very scary decision if the user can make a mistake here - but there is no way to go back.\n\nA: You seem quite panicked and distraught. Your question was very confusing and you may have misunderstood the situation, but from what I could have gathered I can provide these pieces of advice:\n\n*\n\n*The old owner may have incorrectly removed the device from their iCloud account. This is a very easy mistake to make and has happened many times before. To correctly remove it, both you and the old owner need to carefully follow the instructions here (under \"If you no longer have your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch\") otherwise the device may never be recoverable.\n\n*You may have misread the instructions and inputed the incorrect information into the incorrect fields. Press the back button on the screen until you return to the language selection screen and setup using the instructions here. Preferably, to reduce confusion, use quick setup, to auto-setup wi-fi and iCloud, if your wife (not you) have an iOS device, other iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, running iOS 11 or later. You can find the version number by going to Settings > General > About > Software Version.\n\n*You may have somehow broken the setup instance and the device needs to be reset. To do this follow the instructions here while making sure to choose update (if available, otherwise choose restore), when prompted. Note, this requires you to enter recovery mode, and should be perfectly safe provided the connection isn't interrupted (e.g. unplugging or turning off your computer) while the device is restoring. You shouldn't have to use DFU mode. Once you return to setup, follow the instructions above in part 2 to setup your device.\n\nIf after following these steps, you still can't setup the device, your best option is to go into an apple store and get them to correctly assess the issue your having and get them to fix it.\n", "Q: Apple Script runs fine, need kill switch The following script runs fine in the /etc folder and called by a plist.

Typically a local host only network connection is used, such as TCP/IP or a Mach port. These are complex to set up with AppleScript.\nBelow are a couple of reasonable alternatives.\nFile Based Flag\nYou could use the existence (or lack of) a file to determine how the script behaves:\n\n*\n\n*On launch, script creates an accessible file at a known path:\n/Users/Shared/delete-to-stop-power-script.txt\n\n\n*Periodically, or via kqueue, the script can check the file still exists;\n\n\n*On exit, the script should remove the file.\nUsing files makes dealing with permissions easier. Use chmod 0666 to allow anyone to delete the file.\nThe access permissions of the file can be used to ensure only specific groups of users can delete the file.\nnotifyutil\nUse the lesser known notifyutil utility:\n\nnotifyutil is a command-line utility for interacting with the notify(3)\nnotification system and the notifyd(8) server.  It may be used to post\nnotifications, detect and report notifications, and to examine and set\nthe state values associated with notification keys.\n\nnotifyd allows processes to exchange integer values across processes and user sessions. The format is deliberately simple and constrained to enforce security.\nSee the linked manual page and Brett Terpstra's Quick Tip: system-wide notifications with notifyutil for samples.\nNon-polling\nIf you need a non-polling alternative, Power Manager can trigger scripts on battery levels, offers a power source scripting API, and non-administrator users can be granted rights to cancel or stop events.\nI am a software engineer involved with Power Manager, so feel free to ask me technical questions about how it works.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro doesn't accept any incoming connections - Firewall disabled!

I'm hoping that I've just got a setting set wrong somewhere or something.\nFor years I've used the Reminders app for various things but one of the most regularly used is a shopping list.  Our household tends to pretty much always buy the same things, so basically at this point I have a list of everything we ever buy and I just go into it and uncheck whatever we need, do the shopping, and check stuff off as they get bought.  Anything I uncheck, automatically popped up to the top of the list and stuff maybe we stopped buying, would gradually move down the list further and further.\nI recently upgraded my iPhone SE from iOS 12.x to iOS 14.4.2.  I hate upgrading because you can't roll back if you don't like it, but there was an app I needed to use that required a newer OS.  And now I've run into this problem with Reminders.  They now seem to remember their placement in the list so that when I check off an item, it disappears back down into the bowels of the list wherever it came from, and becomes hard to find again.\nThis has made Reminders basically useless for me and has me thinking I'll need to turn to a 3rd party app for something so simple and basic.  Hugely disappointing since it's always worked great, until this nonsensical change.\nIs there any way to gain the old behavior back again?\n\nA: I had the same issue going to iOS 14, but there's actually a good reason: Reminders now has a few different sorting options to choose from, and the default seems to be ‘manual’ which won't do what you (or I) want.\nTo always keep unchecked items above completed items:\n\n*\n\n*Open the list of items\n\n*Choose the ellipsis menu from the top-right\n\n*Tap Sort By\n\n*Choose Priority\n\n*Choose the ellipsis menu again\n\n*Tap Sort By\n\n*Choose Highest First\n", "Q: Bluetooth 5, Multiple Speakers, and iPad mini 5 on iPadOS 14.5.1 So, I am trying to pair 2 Bluetooth speakers with each other so they share the same audio. I know that starting with iOS 13 there is the \"Audio Sharing\" feature, but I think that is only for iPods or other devices with the W1 chip. I also believe that Bluetooth 5 equipped devices have the functionality to play to two Bluetooth speakers simultaneously.\nI am using an iPad Mini 5, Updated to iPadOS 14.5.1. The iPad has Bluetooth 5 capability, which supposedly allows the connection of multiple devices of the same type. However, when I try to connect 2 Bluetooth speakers, I only get the option to toggle between them, not play audio on both. Am I doing something incorrectly, or am I mis-understanding something? If it makes a difference, I am using YouTube Music with an active premium subscription.\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\nA: Your issue is not with bluetooth but with iOS's audio out selection.\nYour device is connected to both devices as both are present as options in the airplay screen as seen in your image. You can confirm this by going into bluetooth in settings and seeing that both devices are connected.\nThe issue you have is that iOS can only output to one device at once, with the exception of the airplay compatible devices (e.g. Apple TV, HomePod, 3rd-party airplay 2 compatible devices, etc.) or headphones/earbuds with and apple chip, either W1 or H1 (AirPods & beats).\nSo the only way at the moment to get multiple bluetooth speakers playing audio from your iPad is to buy one that are airplay 2 compatible.\n", "Q: What causes Time Machine to perform a non-manual verification? Since verification takes a LONG time, I am naturally curious as to what the criteria are that causes it to occur.\nTime since last verification?\nAmount of data added since last verification?\nFailure of some data validity check (parity bits or the like)?\n\nA: I have not witnessed a Time Machine verify process in many years. If you have your Time Machine icon showing in the menu bar, you can click it while holding the Option key and there's a Verify Backups option.  I've never had this run on its own unless the disk I was using for Time Machine backups was potentially faulty.  In which case, I would run Disk Utility Verify/Repair on it and watch out for any S.M.A.R.T errors being reported. Then I would manually kick off the Time Machine verification. If the disk reports errors in S.M.A.R.T then the disk is dying and urgently needs to be replaced.\nThe only other time I have seen verifications is when you mount a DMG or Sparse Image the Finder will attempt to verify the integrity of the image(s).  This can take a long time because it has to scan every bit of the file and these backups can be quite large.\nI have been using Time Machine over a network to a NAS where the Time Machine data is stored within a disk image called a sparse image.  That means it's one large directory where the data within is split into bands with binary chunks of 134MB each.  If it wasn't a sparse image it would be very similar to a DMG disk image single file with a large fixed size.\nOne way to bypass the verification step is to mount the disk from the Terminal command line instead of using Finder. If the file resides on network volume, you need to mount the share first either via Finder or command line. You can eject the disk from Finder as normal after mounting from the command line.\nhdiutil attach path/to/image/filename.sparsebundle\n\nIt should then be mounted under /Volumes and otherwise accessible in the Finder.\nIf you are mounting from an Apple Time Capsule, then the disk might be failing. If you are sharing this Time Machine backup on a NAS the file might have been damaged in some way. Causing Time Machine to detect a problem that needs to be repaired.  If it's a soft error then it can be repaired. If it's hardware failure like bad sectors on the disk then you need to replace the disk.\nIt would be strongly recommended that you check the integrity of the storage medium. i.e. Disk and that it's not having problems indicating an imminent failure.\n", "Q: How can I print varying number of multiple pages per sheet on Mac? (Standard layout / print multiple pages option does not suit) I've got a bunch of pdfs containing text. Each page is of the same width, but each page is of a different height. Some pages only contain a few lines of text, other pages contain a lot of text.\nI want to print this pdf on a Mac so that each sheet I print on is filled nicely with text. The problem is that the standard 'print multiple pages per sheet' option does not suit, as some pages of the pdf could fill their own page, whereas others are so narrow that 3 or 4 of them could be combined on one sheet.\nAnyone know of a simple software / workaround that solves my problem? Thanks so much!!\n\n\nA: I wait to be corrected, but I'm not convinced that any 'simple' software exists to do this easily. (I'm wondering whether Safari will split up PDF content for printing in the same way as it does for web pages -- though of course that can cut the page in the middle of a line of text.)\nYour best bet is to manually place each PDF page onto the fixed pages of some DTP software, like Affinity Publisher, or Scribus, or InDesign. Unless you've got more than 100 pages, this shouldn't take too long.\nHaving written a number of python scripts that interact with MacOS's CoreGraphics, it is conceivable that a utility could be written to 'consolidate' the pages onto the pages of a new PDF; though this would require some work.\n\nA: Thanks, I did find a solution for my problem.

I currently get a text message for every voicemail I receive on my iPhone, how do I turn that off?\nI already have visual voicemail within iOS, so there’s no need for an additional transcript of my voicemails.\nOn Android, they offer an app for managing voicemail but their support pages and forums don’t contain instructions for how to turn this off on an iPhone. This is a common problem that many customers complain about having a hard time fixing.\n\nA: In the T-Mobile app:\n\n*\n\n*Open “Account” tab\n\n*Click “Profile settings” link\n\n*Select “Block...”\n\n*Select “Block Other” on the line you wish to update\n\n*Turn on “T-Mobile Voicemail to Text Block”\n\n", "Q: Dual Monitor Setup with Mac Mini (2014) Screen Blinking I have a Mac Mini from Late 2014 (2,6 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3). I want to use two monitors with it - the two Monitors are identical BenQ GW2283. I managed to get both monitors running yesterday evening, but when I woke the system from sleep this morning, the problem was back again.\nOne Monitor is connected directly via HDMI. The other one is connected via Mini DisplayPort to HDMI. The monitors came with VGA connectors so I bought the HDMI cables and the Mini DisplayPort. As soon as two monitors are connected, the one that was first connected starts flashing, fading to black and shortly showing the system, then fading out again. I made a little video of this happening. The system does detect the second monitor, because I can move my cursor offscreen. The other monitor then prompts \"no cable connected\". This Problem seems to be related to order. Whatever monitor currently works will start flashing once I plugin the second one. It doesn't seem to matter whether I plugin the DisplayPort or the HDMI first.\nI have tried resetting the NVRAM but that didn't have any effect. I hope to get some ideas or maybe even the answer to my problem from someone here, before I rush out and throw money at the problem by buying all sorts of other adapters.\n\nA: I believe it to be a bug: it's a widely reported problem on a variety of Minis using HDMI, and I've certainly encountered it on my 2018 Mini.\nA 'quality' HDMI cable may improve things. Turning off the 2nd display and turning it back on again may also make it snap out of it.\nYou don't say what OS you're running, but I would make sure that you keep up to date with OS updates, in case a fix is released. I believe that Big Sur 11.4 is expected imminently...\n", "Q: Where does homebrew install a legacy php version? In order to make some old software work, I need to downgrade my PHP version from 8 to 7.4. I run this command without any problems:\nbrew install php@7.4\n\n... and homebrew buzzes and whirs and dutifully installs php 7.4.\nNow the problem is that I have no idea where the binary for php 7.4 lives.\nI tried ls -al /usr/local/bin/ | grep \"7.4\", but that didn't come up with any results.\nWhen I do php -v, I still get version 8 showing up.\nWhere can I find the version-specific legacy binary for php 7.4?\n\nA: Since PHP 8 is already installed, Homebrew won't link an earlier version of PHP to php.\n\n*\n\n*Try brew link php@7.4\n\n*Otherwise access the Cellar directly: /usr/local/Cellar/php@7.4/*/bin/php\n", "Q: Using a macbook SSD as a replacement in iMac I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) and iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015)\nthe Macbook Pro will be disposed for various reasons.\nI want to know if it's possible to use the SSD 2To in  MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) as a replacement SSD in iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015) which has currently a 3,12 To fusion drive (128 ssd / 3to hard drive) ?\n\nA: According to this definitive guide of Apple SSD modules:\nhttps://beetstech.com/blog/apple-proprietary-ssd-ultimate-guide-to-specs-and-upgrades\nyour iMac can use the 'Generation 5' SSD module that comes in your MBP, even though the iMac originally comes with 'Generation 4'.\nDon't forget that if you replace one part of a Fusion Drive, the data on the 'volume' is entirely lost, so make sure you've got a backup before starting.

What do I do?\nnot just this URL, curl in the terminal on my Mac gives this error for any URL.\n\nA: The content you get from a server doesn't just depend on the URL. It can depend on the request method, the language preferences, user agent, cookies, etc.\nYou can ask your browser exactly what it sends to the server. Chrome, Firefox and Safari all have a command in their developer tools which copies something to the clipboard that you can paste in a shell window. In Safari, enable developer tools and open the Web Inspector on the current page. In Chrome or Firefox, press F12. In any of these browsers, in the developer tools, go to the Network tab, reload the page, select the first location and “Copy as cURL” from the context menu (it may be in a “Copy” submenu). Then paste the command in a terminal. The command will have the form\ncurl -X GET -H … http://192.168.31.37:5000/aa\n\nYour curl command doesn't specify a method, so it's a GET by default. The form specifies a POST. So if you're trying to simulate entering the form, you'll need to pass -X POST to curl, and of course to pass the form data. To see what the browser sends with the form, open the developer tools' and switch to the ”Network“ tab before submitting the form, then use the “copy as cURL” command from the form URL.\n", "Q: The volume is the wrong format for a backup. Why? For late visitors to this question - the highest-voted answer is completely wrong. I offered the bounty but did not award it. The bounty was auto-awarded by the system. I cannot revoke it.\nThe workaround I had found has since failed again. If anyone manages to find a true working solution to this, a 500 pt bounty is all yours.\nTL:DR\nI've honed this issue down to one simple 'fact'.\nThe Time Machine drive will error with \"The volume is the wrong format for a backup.\" on any attempt, by any method, to copy any file from within Backups.backupdb to any APFS volume. It works to any HFS+ volume.\nI can copy a file to the TM volume root [outside the Backups.backupdb folder] & then copy out to APFS, but anything inside the backups folder will error.\n\nI've trimmed most of the early experimental structure from this & left just the pertinent latest information\nmacOS Mojave, Mac Pro 5,1\nBoot drive APFS [SSD], Time Machine drive HFS+ [HD]. All drives internal.\nI have tested using two clones of my boot drive, as one SSD is mounted on a PCI card & the Mac considers it 'external'. This seems to make no difference. Boot drives are SSDs, GUID/APFS, case-insensitive.\nTime Machine has been tested to three different drives, starting with the original year old backup & then with brand new backups & even brand new hard drives. All formatted GUID/HFS+ case-insensitive, as standard.\nAll drives have been tested with both TechTool Pro 14 & DiskWarrior [HFS only for DW] & all have a clean bill of heath.\nAll drives were formatted in Disk Utility using standard methods. Time Machine was set up & run as standard.\nFiles tested for recovery have been checked & opened to see they are still correct & not corrupted in any way - from original source & also directly from within Time Machine. Images & text files have been tested. No corruption detected at all.\nRecoveries tested from Safe Mode [from where I deleted all local snapshots, including some sticky ones that wouldn't go away], no change.\nRecoveries also tested from a new admin account. No change.\nAdditional, possibly pertinent [though possibly not] information.\nBackups to the same Time Machine from HFS+ volumes will restore to the original HFS volume. Admin permission is requested.\nAny file restored this way will then request admin perms even to delete [& even if 'ignore perms' is set on the drive.]. This is whether it was restored in the normal [working] manner back to HFS or manually dragged from an APFS backup to HFS.\nPerms show the same as any other file on the volume, eg -rw-r--r--@ 1 glee  staff which is exactly the same as any other file in the same folder that wasn't brought back from TM.\nRemoving all attributes xattr -c & setting perms to 'everyone' does not change this request for admin perm to delete.\nRemoving ACLs, chmod -N does stop this admin request, but I can't see what the offending ACL is  0: group:everyone deny write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown unless it's that the owner seems to be 0 not 501.\nRealised SIP was disabled. Re-enabled, ran fix perms on boot drive diskutil resetUserPermissions / id -u trying yet another brand new Time Machine drive…\nNo change.\nAny suggestions, next steps, tests to perform?\nAt the moment I am not willing to destroy the entire boot drive to clean install. I shall be able to try this as soon as Apple ship the new M1 iMacs, as I will then have a spare, almost identical Mac Pro I can play with.\n\nResults of diskutil list & below diskutil apfs list\nThe boot volume is disk6 & disk7 which is PCI-mounted, though the OS thinks it's external.\nIf I boot instead from the other 'internal' SSD, 'Clone' I get exactly the same results.\n/dev/disk0 (internal,

\"ordinary\" Mac systems is the fact that your boot drive is seen as external by the system, even though it is a SSD connected via PCI internally to the computer.\nDepending on what kind of SSD you have, and exactly how it is connected, you could change the setup so that it is recognized as an internal boot drive by macOS. This could change what the system will recognize as okay to restore.\nVendors of some SSDs make a tool available to change whether or not the SSD is \"internal\" or \"external\". Essentially, for drives connected over a SCSI or similar-to-SCSI (e.g. USB) bus, this means that the disk controller has the field \"Removable\" set to 0 instead of 1. Using these tools is using hassle free.\nFor some drives you can make the change easily by simply overwriting the first byte on the drive. The first byte is a bit field where one specific bit is 0 for non-removable (internal) disks and 1 for removable (external) disks. In most cases you can simply write a zero to the first byte on the disk. I would advise taking a backup (i.e. dd-based backup or similar - obviously not Time Machine as that's not working for you) of the drive before doing that - especially if you're used to working a hex-editor and/or the dd command.\nUPDATE:\nAfter you've refined the question, I went back and actually tried this on an old Mojave Mac to see what I can find.\nIt seems the issue is that Finder is trying to be \"intelligent\", so whenever you try to move a Backups.backupdb folder or parts of it to a drive that is not supported as a destination by Time Machine, it will complain that the destination volume is \"the wrong format\".\nOn Mojava you couldn't use APFS volumes for Time Machine backups - and that's why you get this error. The same error message can be seen if you try to copy the file to other types of destinations that are unsupported by Time Machine, for example if you try to copy the Backups.backupdb folder into Dropbox.\nIf you want to copy that way, you can work-around the message by first copying the file outside the Backups.backupdb folder, and then copying it to the connected APFS drive. Or you could copy to a HFS+ drive.\nIt might seem weird that the Backups.backupdb folder is treated differently than any other folder, but it is not uncommon for Apple to do stuff like this in a pragmatic manner. Even the actual operating system kernel treats Backups.backupdb folder as something special, so that they for example do not generate file system events themselves as any other folder would do.\nOLD ANSWER:\nThe bottom line is that your backup has somehow been corrupted. As you're having trouble restoring a specific file that was saved on the 6th of May, it is most probably at this time the corruption occurred.\nIt could be a software bug, a hardware error - or something simple like an unexpected power loss that occured to render the backup structure incomplete. Most likely the file is not really stored, but Time Machine \"thinks\" it is there.\nYou mention that you can see the specific file you're trying to restore in the folders for the 7th, 8th, etc. I would advise simply using Finder or the cp command in the Terminal to copy the file from the backup to a normal disk. You would copy the file from for example the folder for the 7th.\nI'm afraid though, that most likely you'll find that the copy you make is incomplete - i.e. 0 bytes or can't copy at all. This is due to the file actually never having been saved properly in the first place (due to the one of the causes listed above).\nAs you have used the drive for performing backups after the corruption occurred, and now a great deal of time has passed, it is very unlikely that you will be able to use any data recovery tool to recover the data that you originally intended to store in the file.\nUPDATE: You have since updated the question and the update indicates that the source volume and the Time Machine disk are somehow incompatible. This can happen for example if you have a case-sensitive Time Machine disk and try to restore it on an case-insensitive disk. That is not supported.\n\nA: Six months later & I just discovered this has silently broken again, right back to square one.\nAPFS is just not ready for mainstream at Mojave.\n\nUpdate April 2022\nMy current working method is to attempt recovery from Time Machine, which opens the correct, deeply-buried folder from the backup on the Desktop. Finder errors [as expected]. Manual copy to the correct location fails with the same reason…\nso, first I copy to another drive, formatted HFS+, then I can copy that to the correct location. It demands admin credentials to do this, & then again to delete the intermediate copy.\nThis works, & other than being tedious, seems to be the 'solution'. It will just have to do for now.\n\nI appear to have fixed this, at least for now, by taking an entirely different Mac [the now-spare Mac Pro mentioned in my question], formatting, installing a brand new clean OS, then migrating over ethernet directly from the Mac with the issue.\nI had previously attempted to migrate from Time Machine after a clean install, but this was unsuccessful - see Migration Assistant fail - so I knew that was not going to be an option.\nSo, after a clean install + direct computer to computer migration, I now have been able to make yet another brand new Time Machine backup on Mac 'B' & it will restore deleted files from 'Enter Time Machine' back to the APFS boot drive, without error.\nJoy.\nNext experiment will be to clone this back to Mac 'A' & see if it remains fully functional.\nUpdate\nYes, still fully functional after cloning back to the original Mac.\nOf course, I have still no idea why this worked, but I'm happy that it did.\n\nA: On Big Sur (11.6). I replicated the finder error message \"The volume is the wrong format for a backup\" by copying the root folder (2021-09-26-xxxxx) of the latest backup from a Time Machine drive to another external HD formatted as APFS.\nI was actually able to copy all three folders to the APFS drive separately (Macintosh HD, Recovery and Macintosh HD - Data)\nI'm considering this a valid workaround for a bug.\n\nA: I was able to successfully move files that gave this message to my hard drive by first transferring them to the Trash on my MacBook Pro running Mojave. No clue why I even thought to try it. Go figure.\n\nA: I found a way to recover files. Select the file or folder you want to recover,  right click and chose \"compress\". The OS will save the zipped file on Desktop.\n", "Q: I can't add/resize a partition with more than 36 GB - there is plenty of free space I wish to install Linux and shrink my existing volumes + add a new partition with 600 GB for Linux.\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         2.0 TB     disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +2.0 TB     disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            15.3 GB    disk1s1\n   2:              APFS Snapshot com.apple.os.update-... 15.3 GB    disk1s1s1\n   3:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD - Data     1.1 TB     disk1s2\n   4:                APFS Volume Preboot                 520.9 MB   disk1s3\n   5:                APFS Volume Recovery                622.1 MB   disk1s4\n   6:                APFS Volume VM                      2.1 GB     disk1s5\n\nThe UI (Disk Utility) does not allow me to create more than 36 GB partition.

Here's a similar question: Migrating to new iMac, what does Migration Assistant actually migrate?\nThe reason I'm asking again now is because this question was asked TEN YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS ago, which was before back when Mac OS X 10.7 Lion was released! Since then, there have been 10 updates to macOS, so I'm pretty sure the information is quite outdated.\nI'm using macOS Mojave 10.14.6, and I've made several changes to the operating system such as setting a Root User passcode, creating a hidden super-user account, overriding Gatekeeper to allow installation of all apps, executing countless commands in Terminal, manually deep-cleaning all traces of a bugged antivirus that would never fully uninstall, installing a boatload of Homebrew, and even keeping all remnants of the fabled Macromedia Flash Player. My Early-2015 Macbook Pro 13\" with Retina display runs surprisingly fast, but it was a base model with weak hardware. I recently got myself a Mid-2019 Macbook Pro 15\" with Touchbar and the best hardware (except the hard drive is 1TB instead of 4TB, but that's way better than the 256GB I've struggled with for the past 6 years– but it runs Mojave, so I'm happy keeping my 32-bit apps that are not longer supported).\nI need to migrate everything, but I don't have time to be picky. Would Migration Assistant do everything I need? Should I install from a Time Machine backup? or is there another way that's not tedious but will be effective and not compromise the newer Macbook's performance?\n\nA: \nUnfortunately, it does not necessarily not transfer what you tell it not to transfer, nor does it for what you do tell it to transfer for that matter. I told it to exclude one of the users, and that was honored. However, I told it not to transfer certain folders, but it did that anyway. I told it not to import printer settings, but it did that anyway. I told it to import network settings, but it did not regardless. I did have to reconfigure the Root User, but the rest went well… except that a bunch of things went wrong toward the end but I wasn't around to see what they were at the time, so when I noticed the alerts that disappeared the moment I saw them, I became worried. Not a big deal, really. All seems to be operational.\nHomebrew transferred just fine, too, btw.\nHow do I know that all my system tweaks transferred as well? I'm not entirely certain (Gatekeeper will need to be tweaked again, brightness settings are different per the device, and… well, practically everything under the Security & Privacy settings did not transfer [successfully?]), but I had no trouble finding what migrated successfully… at least, I had less trouble when Spotlight finished caching the entire hard drive because apparently it didn't transfer that useful data.\nIronically, it even brought over the broken stuff. Two remnants from my time trying to get Avid Media Composer to work (question mark icons in my Dock, which is still pinned to the right side of the screen like it was on the other device). Probably the most hilarious and frustrating flaw it inherited is my DNS-VPN-Proxy-WiFi-internet-related problem– on which I shall seek answers next.\nAlso, fun factoid: If you give administrator privileges to an account that had parental controls on it, the parental controls will remain active even without any other administrator accounts to manage it!\n\nA: If you want it to be entirely the same, then you should make a clone of the entire disk using SuperDuper! or CarbonCopyCloner.\n", "Q: BigSur Click on Dock App does not change to Space with App On catalina and earlier osx, I used to click on the app on dock to switch between spaces.

I configured the vm to use all CPU 16 cores and 6G of memory.\nOn windows I do Qt/C++ coding and I noticed macbook fans go full noise frequently (not to say all the time).\nI shared a folder from macos to windows (parallels shared folder) and I work on that folder all the time from windows and macos at the same time. I do all I can on macos but since the app I'm coding is a windows app I need to build on windows side.\nThe shared folder was on iCloud before and I recently moved it out because of performance concerns. I'm not sure this helps or not.\nAs I said, on windows side I build my code on a shared folder (parallels shared folder from host to guest). An alternative is not to work on a shared folder, however this way I cannot use macos simultaneously.\nDo you guys see my working environment setup is causing a performance issue? I was not expecting the fans to go high that much.\nIn order to further study the issue I configured a windows laptop where I can login using windows remote desktop from macos thus being an alternative to virtual machine. And I compared the build time, on vm it takes around 1.5x (100s vs 150s) of the time it takes to build on real hardware on the windows laptop. I actually was expecting it to be the around the same. Is this reasonable?\n\nA: This is all very anecdotal, but the 'best' number of cores to assign for maximum performance is 'the actual number of cores, excluding virtual cores'. In your case 8. You could probably get away with giving it more RAM too. 8GB is safe out of 16, though you might get away with 12.\nYou'll never get a VM to compile as fast as a hardware install, if all else is like for like. Compiling is always going to work the machine hard - or it's not going as fast as it can. The trick of using all the 'real' cores is that you leave yourself enough breathing room to still be able to work without hinderance on the Mac side at the same time.\n\nA: In order to tune your virtual machine and Mac for the best performance, Parallels usually recommends to properly share your Mac resources between Host and Guest.\nYou can provide your virtual machine with all CPUs you had, but Host will have nothing left and this will slow down the whole system.\nIn your case, you can allocate 12 CPUs to your VM and check the performance.\n", "Q: Why does my Startup Security Utility window look different?

It went up to the current window's top bar, double clicked. This caused that window to minimize. Then it selected something on the next window (it was an Amazon window, it selected a particular shirt color). Then went to that window's top bar and double clicked. The next window was still a chrome window, but the content of the webpage wasn't interactable. On it, the mouse then zoomed in, dragged around a little, then went to the top of the screen and double clicked a running application's menu bar icon. Incidentally, this triggered a macOS dialog box to open asking me if I'd like to grant permission to the application to register all key events from all applications.\nAt this point I immediately stepped in and started moving the mouse around to prevent it from hitting accept. I think it's important to note here that the mouse wasn't moving like a person would move it, but jumping from point to point. Despite intervening, the mouse just kept exhibiting what seemed like programmed behavior. Then in an effort to prevent any more activity I locked the screen. To my surprise, the behavior continued, then after several minutes stopped on its own.\nNot long after — perhaps 20 minutes — it started exhibiting what appeared to be the same pattern of motion (moving up, double clicking, moving to the center, clicking, etc.). This all happening on the lock screen.\nI tried disconnecting my trackpad and even my keyboard, but it did not stop the behavior. Now, it has been some hours since it first started, it stopped a couple of times more, but now it seems perpetual (been going on for two hours now).\nIs there any way for me to determine what could be causing the mouse to click and move without my input?\n\nA: A couple of suggestions to get you going…\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect it from the network [not just the internet]. Reboot.\n\n\n*Disable any Automator actions ~/Library/Automator [perhaps zip them, then delete, as there can be many in there for legitimate reasons].

My Apple ID address is NEVER used or given out and I use alias’es for my iCloud email correspondence.\nI know that Facebook links profiles among their different services, in many cases through the phone number, so they basically know that it is the same person in Facebook/Instagram than the one on Whatsapp.\nMy question is:\nDoes Whatsapp have access to my Apple ID address? Or is the address not shared on iOS, although Whatsapp may use the account to do the iCloud Backups? I’m askimg because by no means I want to be a linkage between my social media email accounts (or any other address) to my Apple ID address.\nAlso, when an app tries to use Apple ID to create an account on iOS, you always have the option to “Hide email address” from the app. Hopefully thats the case for Whatsapp (but what about the iCloud backups?)\nThank you\n\nA: Short answer; no. If you want to know what the app does share its linked under the privacy portion of the app's page:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997\nFrom what I can see there, your Apple ID isn't even shared with the app's devs.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have my two AppleIDs tied to different services? I have two AppleIDs, for path dependent reasons. (I used a non-email one that got converted to a gmail address for iTunes purchases back in the nether times, and I have a me.com one from when mobileMe existed.)\n\n*\n\n*The one that was just a user name and now a gmail email address is linked to:\n\n*\n\n*iTunes Store purchases\n\n*iOS app purchases\n\n\n\n*The one on me.com is linked to:\n\n*\n\n*MacOS (OS X ) app store\n\n*AppleTV and AppleTV+ (because I recently bought both a new phone and A-TV, so they gave me a free year; this does mean I have two one-year offers)\n\n*Apple Arcade (same; both new phone and A-TV)\n\n*iCloud, and thus my iPhone syncing, cloud backup, iMessage, etc.\n\n\n\nFor a long time, I have had my iPhone, while \"controlled\" by the me.com AppleID,  do its purchases via the gmail-based AppleID.\nI get that this is a mess, but I'd like to bring some order, if possible, because on both my computer and phone, I have to sign-out on one account and sign back in on the other, in order to shift between use/purchase on Apple TV and, say, the App Store. That is, if I'm signed in to the Me.com ID to watch TV+ on the computer/phone, and I then want to go buy an app or a music track, I have to switch to the gmail ID. This is a point of friction that I'd like to eliminate or lessen, but I'm not sure it is possible.\n(I had been hoping to get two years of free TV+ out of my recent upgrade purchases by stacking the offers [is that possible?]. Would be willing to consider \"burning\" one of them if it's possible to consolidate all to one media purchasing ID.)\nI have added both IDs to Family Sharing (where the me.com ID is the organizer), but when signed into iTunes under the me.com ID, the computer/phone does not \"see\" the purchases associated with the gmail ID.\nWhat methods, if any, exist to allow me to continue with the scheme above (two IDs, linked to different services) while eliminating the friction having to sign in and out to use the services? If that is not possible, what do people suggest would be the \"simplest\" way to make this all easier?\n\nA: To answer my question, after contacting Apple support--\n\n*\n\n*One cannot have two Apple TV+ promotions going on the same Apple ID, or on two Apple IDs that are part of Family Sharing;\n\n*One cannot change the Apple ID that used for the Apple TV+ Promotion.\n\nIf you want to change the ID associated with a service, at least when you start via a free offer, you can cancel and re-sign up with the ID you prefer.\nIn my case, since I've got two offers going, the \"best\" thing to do to transfer over is to redeem the offer while signed in to Music.app, TV.app, or whatever, on the account one wants associated with the subscription.\nSo make liberal use of that calendar app.\n", "Q: How to focus parent terminal tab of shell script for input?

Well put.\" to my comment under the OP...\n\nCould you please clarify what it is you are trying to do? Are you trying to have the shell script itself refocus the tab/window in which the shell script is running? In other word, do you want to start the shell script and when the 15 minutes are up, regardless of what app is frontmost, you want Terminal to come frontmost to the tab/window in which the shell script is running and this all be done programmatically?\n\nThe following example AppleScript code used in conjunction with osascript in a zsh shell script should do as wanted. Obviously the value of the sleep command is just for testing purposes, use whatever it is you are now using as the timer within your current zsh shell script.\n#!/bin/zsh\n\n    # First line of code of shell script.\n\nwinID=\"$(osascript -e 'id of window 1 of app \"Terminal\"')\"\n\n    # Function to refocus window of running script.\n\nrefocusWindow() {\n\n        # Code to refocus window of the\n        # running shell script using the \n        # window id retrieved from the first \n        # line of code in the shell script.\n\n    osascript <<EOS\n    tell app \"Terminal\"\n        set frontmost of windows whose id = $winID to true\n        activate\n    end tell\nEOS\n}\n\n# Do some stuff...\n# Your other code goes here.\n\nsleep 5\n\nrefocusWindow\n\n\nNotes:\nIn Terminal, it does not matter how may tabs/windows there are as there is only one tab per window, even if the window appears to have multiple tabs.  In other words, asking Terminal to count windows and count tabs of windows will return the same number. Thus there it no need to loop thru tabs to achieve the goal herein, just windows, and actually in this case there really is no need to loop thru windows.\nNote that macOS Sierra what the last version in which Terminal supported multiple tabs of a window programmatically. In other words, from the UI a single window with two tabs there would be tab 1 of window 1 and tab 2 of window 1, but since macOS High Sierra from the UI a single window with two tabs there would be tab 1 of window 1 and tab 1 of window 2, and thus no longer the need to loop thru tabs.\nThere is all so no need to do something like set selected of tab j of window i to true as once a given window is set frontmost, the value of tab 1 of window i is already set to true as a result.\nThe example shell script and AppleScript code, shown above, was tested in Terminal as an executable shell script under macOS Catalina and macOS Big Sur with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate setting in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nAs we do not know how you have your zsh shell script coded, you'll have to work in the code presented herein to suite your needs.\n\nA: Here's one inelegant way to do it, adapted from a decade-old SO answer:\nopen_this_tab() {\n    rand_string=$(openssl rand -base64 12)\n    echo $rand_string\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\"\n        set allWindows to number of windows\n\n        repeat with i from 1 to allWindows\n            set allTabs to number of tabs of window i\n            repeat with j from 1 to allTabs\n                if contents of tab j of window i contains '\"\\\"$rand_string\\\"\"' then\n                    set frontmost of window i to true\n                    set selected of tab j of window i to true\n                end if\n            end repeat\n        end repeat\n        end tell'\n}\n\nTesting it out:\nsleep 3\n# (go to a different window or tab)\nopen_this_tab\n\n", "Q: Need help configuring specs for new Mac and my software needs I have to buy a new Mac and I have two programs I'm hoping to optimize with the new set up.

You might do better to ask on the discussion forums of contact the vendor. Failing that a few web searches suggest the following.\nTwinmotion says minimum RAM requirement is 32 GB. Of the existing Macs, that means an Intel based Mac.  So either:\nDesktop: 27\" iMac 2020 with at least 32GB RAM and, I would suggest, fastest CPU (core i9) and at least one of the 8GB graphics options.\nPortable: 16\" MacBookPro 2019 with at least 32GB RAM and, I would suggest, fastest CPU (core i9) and one of the 8GB graphics option.\nThe iMac would be faster, but you don't say if portability is a requirement. Nor how large a screen size you require - or do you have a suitable monitor already?\nIf you were to pass on Twinmotion, then you could get one of the current M1 (ARM) Macs, though the Intel ones above would be excellent too.  See Archicad performance on M1.  Again you have choice of portable (13\" screen) or desktop (24\" screen). I would maximise the RAM (16GB) for your usage.\nI hope you get a more authoritative response, but this may help for now.\n", "Q: Set file created/modified timestamp to the earlier of the 2 for a ton of files?

TTP 14 can handle APFS & seems to handle it well so far [I've only recently got the upgrade].\nidk if any of them do a free trial.\n", "Q: 2x 4gig + 1x8gig Or 4x 4gig/2x 8 Gig sticks So recently some people in the office have been complaining there macs are intently slow.\nNow I dont know much about macs but because im one of 2 devs on staff I ofcourse Know all there is to know about IT.\nMy manager says its a Network/Server issue but I cant see how a server can cause Adobe/General Mac operations to slow.\nThe only common ground on all of these macs are that as the title mentions they all have the following memory setup:\n2x 4gig sticks and 1 8gig Stick\nFrom my windows experience although this works its a bad practice.\nI further Believe its this as my Computer is the only one in the office with 2x 8gig sticks and I have 0 Issues with my machine Doing way more intense tasks then any of the designers when I run simulated mobile devices in the few hundreds.\nAnyone Can confirm that it is better to use the same Sticks in pairs A.k.a Getting everyones Ram switched so They pair 4's and 8's instead of mix matching?\n\nA: Yes, always avoid mix ‘n match...\n4 * 4 or 2 * 8 is much better.\n", "Q: Random dummy spinning beachball As the title describes, I keep getting a random spinning wheel, but there is no crash/hanging of the system of any sort. I've been getting these for the last two or so years, but only recently it has started occuring much more frequently, prompting me to ask it here.\nI have a 4GB early 2015 MacBook Air on MacOS Sierra. The wheel appears randomly and is not application specific. I can still move the wheel using my trackpad, so the system is definitely not hanging. However, once I click the trackpad, it disappears, with no other effect. I probably must mention that when the wheel appears, it appears \"on top\" of all applications, in the sense, that once I click the trackpad to make it disappear, I'll have to click once again on the application window I was previously working with to interact with it.\nI am just curious about this strange behaviour as I haven't found any similar issue discussed anywhere else.\n\nA: The spinning beachball doesn't indicate a truly 'hung' app, it indicates a pending transaction that the app is still waiting for time to process. It ought to only occur when the cursor is hovering directly over the app responsible. If you click anywhere except inside your currently-frontmost app, it will bring another to the front & then you will have to switch back.\nHaving said all that, my prime suspect on a 4GB RAM Mac would be it is paging to virtual memory & having to wait for the swap to finish. Clicking another app will make it have to swap out & then back again, doubling the time it takes.\nThis may explain a beach ball that doesn't appear directly related to one given app, but the overall machine is struggling to keep up.\nYou could test this by keeping Activity Monitor visible on-screen, set to the Memory tab, & see what apps seem to be using the most [browsers get complicated because each tab has its own memory, not just the browser itself] & see what colour the Memory Pressure graph at the bottom of the window shows. Green is fine, orange is starting to become an issue & red will surely start to show problems.\nThe value for Swap Used may also be indicative of the issue.\n", "Q: macos disable power cpu throttling I have a faulty battery in my Macbook Pro. Battery status is stuck at 2% and shows as \"no charging\".\nI believe this is causing my CPU to be throttled, pmset -g thermlog outputs this:\nNote: No thermal warning level has been recorded\nNote: No performance warning level has been recorded\nCPU Power notify\n    CPU_Scheduler_Limit     = 100\n    CPU_Available_CPUs  = 8\n    CPU_Speed_Limit     = 50\n\nSince the battery is already dead, I just want to either disable the battery or disable the throttling feature.\nIs there a way to do this via software? I know I can probably open the laptop and unplug the battery but want to first try a software alternative.\n\nA: It makes sense that the machine will throttle if the battery is dead, because the charger is not capable of delivering on-demand high power throughput - that's the battery's job.\nThe fix is… a new battery.\nI don't know whether this is technically bypassable, but if you do, then whenever high power is required, the mac will just hard-crash.\n", "Q: How do I determine the negotiated link speed for a network connection in Big Sur? How do I determine the negotiated link speed for a network connection in Big Sur?\nBig Sur removed the handy Network Utility tool that displayed this information. This tool was powered by many standard Unix tools, most of which I can replicate. However, I cannot find how to determine the current link speed for my networking connection.\nI'm not looking for the current transmission speed - this can be found in System Information. I want the link speed, which is the maximum theoretical transfer speed. Knowing this value can be handy when configuring a wifi network to make sure you are connected to the proper band, the band is configured right, and you aren't leaving any potential speed on the table.\nI've seen suggestions to use ifconfig but this does not output any useful information.\n$ ifconfig  en0 | grep media\n$    media: autoselect\n\n\n\nA: my suggestion (albeit very ugly) is to use the airport utility thats hidden in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources, if you use 'airport -I' it will give you the max rate which I think is equivalent to the link speed.

I am looking for a way to randomize local administrator accounts on MacOS.

I created a volume in disk utility, and called \"projects.dmg\".  I assigned a password to it, and stored it in my home directory.  All is good.   I can now mount this volume in terminal, using \"cd /users/me; open projects.dmg\".   The volume asks for a password and then mounts the volume on my desktop.  GOOD.\nI can then use it, and all is well.  When I want to unmount it,  I issue the command \"umount /Volumes/projects\", and it disappears from the desktop.  Looks good too.\nHERE is the issue...

How do I get the volume to act like I put it in the trash, so it will ask for a password when I mount it again??? Help?\n\nA: If you want it to ask for the password again, assuming it hasn't been stored in your Keychain, you need to eject the disk image, e.g.:\n diskutil eject projects\n\nBTW, the disk image is mounted at /Volumes/ not the Desktop.

I'm trying to use crontab to schedule the 'enable wifi' command: networksetup -setairportpower en0 on.\nI've been entering this command in the required format in the cron file, eg.:\n05 15 * * * networksetup -setairportpower en0 on\nHowever, it isn't working. This command works when I use it normally, and I've used crontab to successfully run other commands. Why is the command not running as intended, and what should I do to fix it?\n\nA: In addition to possible permissions problem, you might be having trouble because networksetup isn't in the default PATH for cron jobs. The default path for cron jobs includes just /bin and /usr/bin, but the networksetup executable is in /usr/sbin, so the command will not be found.\nTo prevent this problem, you can use an explicit full path for the command:\n05 15 * * * /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\nAnother option is to adjust the PATH variable in the crontab file (before the command that depends on it), something like this:\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n05 15 * * * networksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\nAlso, when troubleshooting cron jobs, it's often very helpful to capture errors and output from the jobs in some easily-accessible place, and then examine them to see what they indicate. You can capture them with a redirect, something like this:\n05 15 * * * /usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportpower en0 on >>/tmp/cronjob.log 2>&1\n\n...and then look at /tmp/cronjob.log after the job runs.\n\nA: I'm trying to get something similar to work too (using the -setairportnetwork option)\nMy WiFi access point is misbehaving, and sometimes restarts. When it does that, many of my MacOS systems do not automatically reconnect, and this is very inconvenient for my Mac mini that does not have a keyboard, mouse, or ethernet attached.\nFrom the networksetup \"man\" page (man networksetup)\n\nThe networksetup command requires at least\nadmin privileges to change network settings. If the \"Require an administrator password to access system-wide preferences\" option is selected in System Preferences >\nSecurity & Privacy, then root privileges are required to change network settings.\n\nBut I expect there's something different about the context in which cron runs a user's job than when it runs whilst logged into the desktop.\nIn my case, when it fails it outputs the following:\nError: -3930  The operation couldn’t be completed. (com.apple.wifi.apple80211API.error error -3930.)\n\nand the only place I can find error \"3930\" documented is in Jonathan Levin's \"new OS X Book\" notes, unfortunately \"Operation not permitted\" isn't much to go on.\nPerhaps Marc is indeed thinking in the right direction, at least that if not running interactively as a \"Desktop\" user then it needs to run as root. Going to try that, next, and report back...\nUpdate (20210603)\nWhen I looked more closely at my logs I saw that it had successfully re-associated to the network at least once or twice before failing with the above error: to reiterate, that was when running from my own user crontab.\nBut, I did switch to running it from root’s crontab and it has worked successfully several times since then. So I’d definitely suggest trying that (sudo crontab -e being the way I went about doing that).\n", "Q: Why do aliases with words not expand in big sur?

I also tried a simpler, 3-keypress combo:\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to key code 13 using {control down, command down}\"\nThis did not work either.\nSo how can I use multiple modifier keys here?\n\nA: OK, here is a workaround to the problem. Unfortunatley, this really isn't an answer as it doesn't explain why, at the lower OS level, the problem exists in the first place. It just works around the limitation by mapping key strokes with one or more modifiers to single keystrokes. Perhaps people who are more familiar with the keyboard at the lower levels of the OS can use this solution to figure out what might be happening.\nAnyway, as mentioned, OBS Streamlabs can respond to single keystrokes as hotkeys that are simulated with applescript. For example, you can tell OBS to recognize \"1\" on the number pad as a hotkey. The problem, of course, is that using a single key as a hotkey will also generate that character in the terminal or any other app you are working in. So the trick is to tell OBS to set up a hotkey for numkey 1 and then remap a key stroke with one or more modifier keys to that single numkey 1 keystroke.\nThe low-level remapping can be accomplished with the free app Karabiner elements\nSo, using the app, I remapped the command + Num-1 combination to Num-1. So now when I run this simple script from the command line...\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to key code 83 using command down\"\n...no character gets printed by the key stroke simulated by the one-liner above and the hotkey now gets triggered.\nBy they way, I could not figure out how to send keyboard output generated by an apple script to /dev/null. It doesn't appear to be possible, as best I can tell. So something like command + Num-1 that creates a \"silent\" keystroke is needed.\nSo, with this method, I can have a hotkey for all the rarely used keys on the keypad. I can also use all function keys that are not getting used by another app.\n", "Q: How to add ovftool to Catalinas path?

I deleted .DS_Store from folders via terminal using defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool true as the command because the folders were the wrong font size, some size 12, some size 13 and I couldn't find a way to ensure consistent font size or viewing in list for all folders in Finder, upon updating to Big Sur, and it changed the modification dates for some directories of folders containing files that are used for reference but occasionally used.\nI had to tediously use a date-changer to fix the relevant folders 'dates.\nIf I was to lock a folder or series of folders individually via Finder, any deletion of .DS_Store wouldn't affect the locked folders that already had a .DS_Store at the time and the settings within .DS_Store?\nIn theory, if there's folders you don't want modifying upon opening, locking before doing any delete .DS_Store is a good or bad idea?\nAs apple.stackexchange is about answering questions, I would appreciate an explanation since I've done some light Google-ing on the topic.\n\nA: Yes, locking a folder prevents any files/folders immediately inside of it from being modified, as well as deleting/renaming the folder itself. Items in sub-folders can be edited though.\nI should note that the command you had in your question does not delete any DS_Store files, it simply stops them from being created on network volumes.\nI'll assume you want to run a find command which deletes all DS_Stores, and yes locking a folder will prevent that from modifying the files in it.\n", "Q: Display as an Extended Desktop across 4 x Dell Monitors I have purchased a 2021 13\" Macbook Pro, four Dell 24\" monitors, four HDMI to HDMI cables and a 1-in-8 hub.

I have also purchased two HDMI to Thunderbolt 3 connectors but again only one output works at any time.\nIs it possible to use more than one external monitor in \"extend desktop\" mode?\nAdding necessary detail From OP's comments:\nAPPLE MacBook Pro 13.3\" (2020) - M1, 256 GB SSD, Space Grey - Curry's PC World\n4 x Dell S2421Hn FUll HD 23.8 LCD Monitors - Curry's PC World – Th38ozz\n2 x USD C to HDMI Adapters Syntech (Amazon) / 8 x Snowkids HDMI 8K 60Hz 2.1 Cable (Amazon)\n\nA: The answer depends on whether you have the M1 MacBook Pro or the Intel version.\nM1 Macs\nM1 Macs officially only support 2 monitors, for the Laptops this means one external and the internal screen. This is the same for all M1 macs, i.e. the 13\" MBA, 13\" MBP (M1 version), MacMini and iMac 24\".\nHowever, there is a workaround called DisplayLink. It does work, however, it needs special software and hardware, which means it may break at some point due to lack of support (this is very unlikely in the near future though, it seems like it gains more and more features right now, since there are still some limitations like rotating a screen).\nIntel Macs\nDepending on what exact model (13\", 15\", 16\") you can usually connect at least two external monitors, the more powerful 16\" version can even handle 4 monitors. You mention you have a 13\" MBP, which means you can only connect up to 2 external monitors.\nConnecting more thant the officially supported amount of monitors is again possible with DisplayLink or with an eGPU.\n\nRemember, every pixel your MBP has to render puts more strain to it and will lead to higher CPU/GPU usage. Of course, maybe you need 4 monitors, but it seems like the \"small\" 13\" MBP can't handle that. I have a 2017 15\" MBP with a dedicated GPU and if I charge it and connect a 4K monitor it quickly starts ramping up the fans (depending on the workload), which might not be ideal, too.\n", "Q: Using an external speaker as the left/right speaker with MacBook? I am looking for a way to connect an external speaker as the left speaker to a MacBook Pro to get better stereo sound.\nFrom what I have read in the forums it should be possible to output audio on multiple devices at once, even when connecting over Bluetooth. With the latest updates to surround sound standards (AirPlay 2?) this should be possible.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/audio-midi-setup/ams1005/mac\nCan someone please tell if the resulting sound will be balanced - and if the audio balance can be further tweaked in MacOS or using some third party app?\n\n\nA: Here is my proof of concept that this can be done. I connected 2 sets of 2 speakers laid out next to each other and added them to an Aggregate device in MIDI tool.\n\nThen I configured the left speaker of one set to play only L channel and right speaker from second set to play only R channel.\nI was unable to assign the entire set of speakers to play one channel. There was an option to setup Quadraphonic sound with 4 speakers, but that did not work for me and I had to use only Stereo with 2 speakers (the far left and far right). It had to do with the app - movies played on all 4 speakers, but music played on the default speakers, bypassing any MIDI settings I made for the aggregate device.\nThe resulting sound is more spacious than purely from the MBP, but due to not being able to play Quadraphonic sound 2 of my 4 speakers in the middle are sitting idle. This would also cause an even bigger imbalance between the 100W left speaker and just right one of the MBP tiny speakers.\n\n\n", "Q: Thunderbolt Bridge Mode: compatible to rtp midi/ multicast udp When a thunderbolt bridge is established as a network with fixed ip‘s between two Macs, does it supports with its emulation a standard ethernet connection in terms of rtp midi and multicast udp data transmission?\n\nA: The Thunderbolt Bridge is not a standard Ethernet connection, but macOS provides you with an IP interface where you can send IP packets between two computers.\nRTP-MIDI is a protocol that encapsulates MIDI messages within RTP packets that are exchanged over the UDP protocol. The UDP protocol runs on top of the IP protocol, and as such RTP-MIDI is fully compatible with Thunderbolt Bridge connections.\nSimilarly multicast UDP runs on top of the IP protocol and as such is fully compatible with Thunderbolt Bridge connections. Obviously its usefulness is not quite the same here, as you normally use multicasting to send the same data to many hosts on the network at the same time.

Question\nIs there any new way the M1 Macs manage memory or long running processes that would explain the behavior I describe below? I wanted to investigate what I might not know about the M1s before chalking it up to a software bug.\nBackground\nWhen I run BOINC (via Rosetta2) it runs without issue with one project per CPU core. But after some time of inactivity it seems that certain cores are \"shutdown\". I have observed this happening one core (bionic task) at a time with about 30secs between the next \"shutdown\".  The BOINC software seems to interpret this as the system not having enough memory. As can be seen in the image each project needs <1GB of RAM to run. With the Mac having 16gb of RAM all tasks can run.\n\nTLDR\nM1 MacBook Air with 16gb seems to \"shutdown\" cores or parts of RAM after a predictable amount of time of inactivity.\nPost Script\n\n\nA: No, the issue you're seeing is not in any way caused by the M1 \"turning off memory\" or \"turning off cores\". It is entirely caused by the manner in which this particular software program is structured.\nRemember to check your BOINC settings - you can actually decide how large a part of your RAM that BOINC can use. The lower you set it (all else being equal), the more you'll see \"Waiting for memory\".\n", "Q: Installing Windows on External SSD on MacBook Pro I am planning of installing windows following the tutorial given by 9to5mac in the link https://9to5mac.com/2020/07/14/install-windows-mac-external-ssd-drive-boot-camp-2020-video/\nI want to do this using Samsung T7 SSD on my MacBook Pro(2020, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\nI have a few questions about this if someone could answer:\n\n*\n\n*How much of the RAM will the windows use when run using the SSD? all 16 gb?\n\n*If I do not have the SSD plugged in, will I be able to login to my MacOS smoothly?\n\n\nA: I think you have a misconeception of how BootCamp and virtualization works.\nBootCamp: Only on Intel Macs!\nWith BootCamp you can install Windows on your Mac. The guide you mentioned shows how to install it onto an external drive, since usually Apple only suggests partitioning your internal drive and installing Windows there.\nAfter installing Windows on that drive or internally you have to shutdown your mac and press cmd + opt while starting up to access the boot menu and select the external drive, i.e. Windows. You will then only run Windows and can't switch back to macOS unless you shutdown Windows and restart into macOS.\nWith BootCamp you are running Windows natively on the Mac, i.e. your Mac basically works the exact same way as an equally spec'd \"original\" Windows Laptop. I.e. all hardware (including 16GB RAM) will be used. This is also the reason why you cant run Windows natively on an M1(ARM) Mac because it is written for x86 and not ARM.\nVirtualization\nThere are multiple programs like Parrallels VMWare,... that allow installing a so called virtual machine. This virtualization allows you to run windows inside macOS, i.e. you basically have access to macOS and Windows at the same time. Windows will run in a seperate window, but if you make that fullscreen it looks like you are only running Windows.\nHowever, since you are running Windows virtualized on top of macOS you have to assing a certain amount of RAM, CPU Cores,... to the virtual machine. This creates performance losses. In this case you would actually not be able to use all 16GB of RAM on Windows (but thats not what they explain in the linked article).\n\nTo briefly answer your questions:\n\nIf I do not have the SSD plugged in, will I be able to login to my MacOS smoothly?\n\nYes. You will simply boot into Mac and since there is no other startup device you dont have to choose macOS in the boot menu. Simply hit the startup button.\n\nHow much of the RAM will the windows use when run using the SSD? all 16 gb?\n\nIf you go the BootCamp route Windows will use all 16GB of RAM.\n", "Q: Possible to boot Linux on MacBook Pro in screen mirroring mode vs dual screen? Looking for a “bios” toggle to tell HDMI output to mirror display vs split screen (at hardware-level vs OS-level). Not sure this exists…\n\nA: It does not.\nThe BIOS screens that you see on modern PCs, besides not being BIOS (rather UEFI) are just not available to modern Macs. That's what you get when you build the software AND the hardware. You don't need a separate interface to adjust the hardware, it is all done from inside macOS.\nThat said, it is possible to make some changes that take effect pre-boot, using the nvram command\nnvram -p\nShould give you all the settings currently set in non-volitale RAM. Many of which you can set yourself. A quick search should turn up resources that show the possibilities.\nThough I doubt you can do what you want to do there. Those settings are controlled exclusively by macOS, so you would likely have to set them inside the OS of anything you booted the Mac from.\n", "Q: iTunes restore error 4014 My iPad PRO (model with home button) has the black screen of death, holding down power+home buttons does not force a reboot, not does holding volume buttons and power button.\nWhen plugged into latest iTunes, iTunes reports that the iPad needs to be restored.

I always get Error: invalidfont.\nI tried the following drivers.\n\n*\n\n*Generic Postscript Printer\n\n*Driver provided by Ricoh\n\n*Ricoh Printer Drivers v3.0 for macOS\nWhat else could I do?\n\nA: From what I can find, the Ricoh MP 2000 is c. 15 years old. PostScript support seems to be an option, rather than as standard.\nHowever, invalidfont is certainly a PostScript error. It frequently occurs in Level 3 PostScript submitted to printers that only handle Level 2.\nYou could see if it will print a PDF from Adobe Reader or Acrobat using the \"Print as Image\" print option in those apps. This will RIP (rasterize) the page data on the computer instead of on the printer.\nI don't know whether those Ricoh print drivers are capable of switching to PCL.

What is the best file system in 2021 to format the external hard drive?\nI would like to encrypt the hard drive and I only use it with Macs so I don't need Windows compatibility. I used to format external drives with encrypted APFS but I heard it's not the best file system for spinning hard drives, only for SSDs.\nHas anyone experience with this? Pros and cons? Should I use APFS or HFS+ for external hard drives? Thank you!\n\nA: APFS has no advantage over HFS+ (macOS extended) and vice versa in terms of post-mount performance when it comes to hard disks (non-SSD drives).\nHowever, macOS Sierra (10.12) or older can not access APFS-formatted disks. On the other hand, though unlikely in the foreseeable future, it is possible that Apple might drop support for HFS+ in some future versions of macOS. Should this happen, you may not be able to access your hard disk from one of the newer versions of macOS in some distant future if you format it in HFS+. In addition, AFPS is said to be less prone file corruption issues than HFS+. I recently had to erase everything on a HFS+ external drive due to corruption issues and reformat it.\nIn summary, if you are planning to access your hard disk from a computer running on macOS 10.12 or older, then format it with HFS+. Otherwise, go with APFS.\nThere are more details in this article titled \"APFS vs Mac OS Extended – Which Mac Disk Format Is Best?\" (1) from switchingtomac.com if you need more information.\nP.S. If you were to use this hard disk with Time Machine, than HFS+ would be your only option if you are using macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or older. Time Machine works with APFS only for macOS 11 (Big Sur).\n\nA: For HDD, if you are not going to install macOS, then use a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) or  Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) format. When using a hard drive just to store files, APFS or APFS (Encrypted) could also be used. The main advantage to APFS is more APFS volumes can be easily added or removed.\nIn your case, open the Disk Utility. Press the ⌘+2 key combination. Highlight the external drive. Select the Erase button and choose the format and scheme given below. Note: High Sierra (macOS 10.13.6) was using in this example.\n\nThe Disk Utility will create a small hidden FAT32 formatted EFI partition followed by a JHFS+ formatted partition. In order to allow encryption, the JHFS+ formatted partition will be converted to a Core Storage partition and a small hidden JHFS+ formatted partition will be added.\nThe output from the command diskutil list external after erasing a 16 GB flash drive is shown below.\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *15.5 GB    disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Untitled                15.2 GB    disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s3\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS MyExternalVolume       +14.8 GB    disk2\n                                 Logical Volume on disk1s2\n                                 C9787C76-7FAA-4E41-AFEC-4F3D8F2AC9CE\n                                 Unlocked Encrypted\n\n \n\nA: In general, almost all HDD formats are perfectly compatible with Windows. You can use APFS or HFS+. There is no difference. It's just a matter of how you know how to configure it and what is more convenient. Recently, my HDD on my Mac broke down, and I had to use Windows for a few months. I used this service -- https://www.salvagedata.com/hard-drive-recovery/, they used HFS+, and it was perfect for me. In general, I suggest you read more about each format on the Internet or watch videos on YouTube. I hope I have helped you, good luck to you, if you have any questions, PM me, I will answer everything.\n\nA: It would seem that one big advantage of using APFS, even on rotating drive, would be that it can take advantage of the copy-on-write technology, via the Finder or in Terminal with cp -c, thereby saving a lot of disk space. This also allows much more efficient use of local snapshots.\nIf the advantage of this is still overweighed by other negative factors, I would welcome your opinions.\nBut this, which I've only recently become aware of, would seem to tip the scales in favor of going to APFS for all drives that don't require write access by pre-Sierra systems or other operating systems.\n", "Q: why cannot I see Library folder under my home directory in Finder? I could see ~/Library through Unix command in Mac, yet I cannot see it in a Finder window. I need to go as Finder -> Go to folder -> ~/Library, then I can find it. Does anyone know why is it like that? Thanks! It's macOS Big Sur.\n\nA: Yes, that folder is hidden by default along with another bunch of files and folders becasue most users never need or want to go into it.\nTo make it visible press:\nShiftCommand . \nThat's Shift-Command-Period, it will reveal all the hidden files.

They're definitely still stored at full resolution on the phone, because she can email them from the phone and they're the expected size (4032x3024) and sharpness.  And the vast majority of images do seem to be full resolution in iCloud (accessed via www.icloud.com/photos ) , as expected.  No amount of adding the offending images to new albums, or duplicating those images and adding the duplicates, seems to help.\nDownloading the image (using the download icon) from www.icloud.com/photos just retrieves a fuzzy version.\nShe does quite often use www.icloud.com/photos when working on a desktop PC to retrieve her images there, so it'd be nice to have access to all of them there at full resolution.\nIs there any way of giving something a prod so that www.icloud.com/photos will realize it only has low-resolution versions of these images and properly acquire the high resolution versions from the phone?\nTrying to google the topic mainly just finds lots of people confused by storage optimization and why photos are fuzzy on their device.  But we seem to have the reverse issue of (some) images which are sharp on the device are fuzzy \"on iCloud\" (or at least when iCloud is viewed via www.icloud.com/photos ).\n\nA: We have discovered a workround for this issue:\n\n*\n\n*Duplicate the problem image on the phone.\n\n*Use \"markup\" in the photos app to make some miniscule invisible change.  e.g a one-pixel black dot with a semi-transparent pen in some shadowed (but not completely black) region.\n\n*Save the modified image.\n\n*Wait a couple of minutes and the duplicated image appears on www.icloud.com/photos and is the full resolution version, as expected.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that just duplicating the image alone doesn't work: the duplicate will appear on the icloud web-page, but still be fuzzy low-resolution.  Also, modifying the duplicate using other editing controls like exposure, warmth, tint and so on isn't enough of a change to force the upload of a full resolution version, presumably because those parameters are held separately to the original image data (so repeated tweaking doesn't degrade the image).  My guess is modifying the actual image pixel data changes some hash value computed for the image and convinces iCloud there's something needing uploading.\nIt's a good enough solution for the handful of images we want to see properly uploaded at full resolution.\nThe most slightly annoying thing about it is that, while the duplicated and modified photos still seem to have the original date attached, www.icloud.com/photos now displays them at the end of the album and unlike the phone app there's no sort options provided.  Not a big deal though, as her main reason for using the iCloud website is just to download images to the desktop PC.\n", "Q: Understanding work-spaces on macOS - Why does it not save Applications and Positions This may sound a little weird but I'm using spaces on my MacBook (currently latest BigSur version) for a couple years and there are a few behaviour I don't understand.\nI usually work with my MacBook + 1 external display. My \"main\" display is my external display. So I have 1 space on my external display and 3 spaces on my macbook display. Each space has a defined task for me (personally):\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Space 1: One Chrome Window containing our Ticket System\n\n*MacBook Space 2: One Window of Microsoft Outlook 2019 - Mails\n\n*MacBook Space 3: usually has one Window of Microsoft Outlook 2019 - Events\n\n*external Display Space 1: I work here :-) Multiple Chrome windows, IDEs, Terminal, etc.\n\nNote: No applications are running in \"Fullscreen mode\". I always run everything in windowed mode.\nNow when restarting my MacBook all window positions and sizes are screwed. When my MacBook is booted again, I have to rearrange all windows every day manually because neither position nor sizes are being \"saved\".\nIs this the typical behaviour? Why is it like this? I mean I do understand that spaces/windows/positions are getting screwed when you connect/disconnect displays, but that is not the case for me. I start my MacBook having the same Monitors plugged in and I shut it down in the same state. I'd like to understand why it is the way it seems to be or ways to work better with spaces.\nIf you can't follow my thoughts fully, please let me know, I'd try to provide some screenshots.\n\nA: There has never been any provision in Spaces for one app to be on more than one Space. It's simply outside the design spec.\nYou can pin an app to a Space but you cannot pin a window to a Space. Quit & relaunch & the windows will all fold into the same Space.\nWindow sizes should be remembered, but not if they wouldn't fit the display they opened on.\nSleeping the Mac should work, but will be dependant on whether the external display stays 'visible' to the Mac at wake. On Mac Pros here, desktops with multiple external displays, this works just fine. idk how well laptops handle this. Sometimes forcing the display to wake before the Mac succeeds in maintaining the connection.\nOne additional point - Macs don't really need shutting down or restarting all that frequently. Mine generally get rebooted for OS updates etc, the rest of the time they are awake or asleep. Maybe once a month or so, if I feel things might be getting a little sluggish, I will reboot. I've had Mac that ran a decade with little more than this. One never even slept, it was up 24/7/365 for 10 years with the occasional reboot for updates or a shutdown twice a year for a good clean.\n", "Q: Comparing two folders contents with automator (quick action) I work in a video company. Very often, we copy a heavy load of files from SD cards to our own folders, and before we format the SD cards, we want to check for contents on both directories if they are the same.\nI've done some \"Quick actions\" earlier but this one is too tricky for me. What I want to do is compare the SD directory and the media folder (each one has different structure) and check if both contains the same files, regardless of folders.\nIs it possible?\nThis might sound like it has been asked before, but the solution 've seen is extracting folder contents in another folder, which is not efficient.\n\nA: \nWhat I want to do is compare the SD directory and the media folder (each one has different structure) and check if both contains the same files, regardless of folders.\n\nThe fact that you want to compare the contents of, I'm assuming, a single folder on the SD card against another folder on the, e.g., Macintosh HD containing an entirely different hierarchical directory structure ... IMO a shell script is the better way to go.\nThe example shell script code, shown below, get saved as an executable and placed within the PATH passed to the shell in, e.g., Terminal, and does the following:\n\n*\n\n*Creates a list of filenames on the SD Card containing the original files to loop through, attempting to find the duplicate files in the hierarchical directory structure of the directory designated as the parent directory containing the duplicate files on the e.g. Macintosh HD, regardless of where within the hierarchical directory structure they may be located.\n\n*If the original files do not exist somewhere within the parent hierarchical directory structure that supposed to contain the duplicate files, then the original files that don't already exist get copied to the parent directory that's supposed to contain the duplicate files.\n\n*If a filename exist in both locations, regardless of their hierarchical directory structure, a binary comparison is preformed, and if there is a difference it's reported.\n\n*\n\n*Any differences will need to be addressed manually.\n\n*Note that because there may be a possibility that a file with the same name exists more than once in the parent hierarchical directory structure that supposed to contain the duplicate files, any reported difference in the binary comparison will need to be manually verified that the file on the SD Card also exists elsewhere in the local media folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Terminal, assumes pwd is your Home directory, run the following compound command:\nf=\"sdcheck\"; touch \"$f\"; open -e \"$f\"; chmod 0755 \"$f\"\n\nIn the opened sdcheck document, copy and paste the example shell script code, shown below, into the document.

I've been struggling with a very weird issue.  I'm trying to use libgmalloc (eg per man 3 libgmalloc) on Big Sur (I'm on 11.3.1) to trouble shoot a memory issue in my code.  However, I can't set the environment variable DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES.  It sets as a shell variable, but not as an environment variable that can be seen by child processes:\nstuarts@iMac-Pro ~ % export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=\"/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib\"\nstuarts@iMac-Pro ~ % echo $DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES\n/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib\nstuarts@iMac-Pro ~ % env |grep DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES\nstuarts@iMac-Pro ~ % \n\nThe variable doesn't show up in the env listing (and isn't detected by my program using getenv() either).  I started fooling around setting other randomly named variables, and found that I can export \"DYLD\" and \"A_B\", but not \"DYLD_A\" (or other things that start with \"DYLD_\").\nThis seems an extremely strange silent filter in export.\nHow should one use libgmalloc in Big Sur?\n\nA: Given the security features identified in @negacao's answer, the injection of libgmalloc via environment variable is very fragile (it works directly off the command line, but doesn't work when invoked via scripts, or within the debugger).\nInstead, building the application with -lgmalloc in the Makefile worked well both from the command line and in the debugger (as hinted at in the comment from @mmmmmm) and I was able to find my bug in the debugger this way.\nApple needs to update the libgmalloc man page.\n\nA: On my (M1) machine:\n~$ export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=foo\n~$ env | grep DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES\n~$ /opt/homebrew/bin/bash\ndyld: could not load inserted library 'foo' because image not found\n\nAbort trap: 6\n\nSo (as you saw), the variable is being set - but since env is a system binary, it is silently removed.

At first I thought it was just a problem with the Twitter app running in macOS sometimes just stops loading any media (pictures, gifs, videos).

This happens sometimes, I think most notably the next morning. My computer doesn't go to sleep since I use it for some server purposes.\nScreenshots below are of the same tweet around the same time, one in the Twitter app, one in Safari and one in Chrome just to illustrate the point.\nI'm thinking this is some sort of issue with macOS' networking/cache layer?

Restarting Safari or clearing website data didn't help. I did some digging while it was happening. I couldn't see any problems in the Safari developer tools Console (well, I could, but they were all complaining about loading .map files from ton.local.twitter.com and are irrelevant as map files don't need to be there for everything to work.)\nI tried to load a particular failing image in a separate Safari window and it just hung. Then I tried to get the image using a command-line Curl command and found something interesting:\nmatt@Matts-iMac ~/tmp> curl https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FScZYbgXEAAd1iQ\\?format\\=png\\&name\\=small > out.png\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:00:29 --:--:--     0\ncurl: (6) Could not resolve host: pbs.twimg.com\n\nSo, it looked like the problem was with DNS—neither Safari nor my command line could find pbs.twimg.com, oddly. (Everything worked fine in Chrome, and I think that's because Chrome has its own DNS stuff built in; it certainly has more of a local cache than Safari, as I understand it.)\nI had no problems using dig to retrieve the address of pbs.twimg.com, so I figured my Mac's local DNS cache must be a bit broken. And clearing the cache and restarting the cache daemon from the command line fixed the problem:\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache  \nsudo killall mDNSResponder  \n\nAfter I ran those two commands in Terminal, I refreshed Twitter in the still-running Safari window and everything was back up and running.\n", "Q: Can you use Sidecar with 5G only to connect Macbook Pro to iPad Pro M1 devices reliably for work I am using the 13\" Macbook Pro M1 and considering getting a iPad Pro 12.9\" M1 to establish a portable dual screen for work.

Users should be trusted to install their own apps yet I don't want them booting from a different partition.\nI've tried to delete Boot Camp Assistant but that is restricted, even when using csrutil. I can't even set the permissions on it.\nAny ideas on how to disable or remove it while allowing users to install other apps?\nI saw How to disable Boot Camp and prevent any other OS installations? but it doesn't have an accepted answer (because it doesn't answer the question)\n\nA: One of the simplest methods of preventing the use of Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows on a drive is to create a Fusion Container on the drive and install macOS into this container. Normal, a Fusion Container is composed of a partition on a SSD and another partition on a HDD. Here, I intend for the Fusion Container to have both partitions on a single drive.\nThe Boot Camp Assistant requires very specific partitioning arrangements to exist before allowing Windows to be installed. The configuration I propose would not meet the requirements.

My MacMini 2018/2020 is running 10.15.5 with VirtualBox 6.1.12. I have a running VM with 10.15.0 which I snapshot after installation. My plan was to then do a manual upgrade to 10.15.4 thanks to the corresponding combo update, as I do not want to jump to the latest Catalina version.\nThe process of the manual update is to mount the dmg file, which then shows the pkg file that starts the upgrade process when run, and asks to reboot at some point to finalize everything.\nThe reboot doesn't take me to the upgrade process, but back to the 10.15.0.\nThere are many blog posts and guides regarding what to do when you go through the more classical path of having an update be downloaded to /Applications/Install macOS xxx.app.\nMy guess is that at some point, both ways of upgrading follow the same process (eg reboot to some kind of \"upgrade partition\" that will overwrite the OS files, reboot to upgraded OS). I would like clarifications on the parts where these upgrade paths differ, so that I can troubleshoot what is preventing me from reaching 10.15.4.\nIn the past, I did similar things with 10.14 and my notes on the topic don't show such an issue (rather issues with lack of APFS support in VirtualBox at that time). In particular, I think the partition layout has changed since then.\nEssentially, what I tried so far:\n\n*\n\n*start manual upgrade process through the .pkg, reboot\n\n*interrupt boot by hammering Esc, reach some kind of grey and blue boot manager (is that VBox or Apple stuff? this is not the VBox EFI shell, there is a text-based UI menu with \"Device Manager\"/\"Boot Manager\"/\"Boot Maintenance Manager\")\n\n*explore partitions, looking for an EFI boot file (I spotted the recovery one, can't find the \"regular\" one nor the \"upgrade\" one)\n\n*boot\n\nFor example, I wonder if the pkg is partially extracted and that I am supposed to find a boot.efi somewhere on the \"System Data\" partition. If so, where should I look for it? Do I have a more \"sysadmin\" way of deploying this upgrade, in particular without reboot?\n\nA: I restarted from scratch, with a new dynamic VDI of 60GB instead of 30GB, as I felt I would be in trouble later with the installation of Xcode.\nThe upgrade went flawlessly.\nThere was definitely no obvious sign nor warning that more space was needed previously.\n", "Q: I’m converting PDFs to ePubs using calibre, it is very slow can you suggest faster alternatives?

I am trying to install the printer driver for the printer HP LaserJet M1005 MFP on MacOS Big Sur.\nI tried many ways and followed HP official website guide. But none of them works. (This may because the printer model is old. The provided driver does not install on Big Sur. New recommended way of using HP Easy Start.app and HP Smart.app don't work on this model too)\nNow, I found out an installer file which may work at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1888?locale=en_GB\nThe page does NOT have many information (the file's author etc) and I never use and download anything from https://support.apple.com/kb/. I don't know if anyone can upload files to https://support.apple.com/kb/ or not.\nSo basically, can I trust that installer from the above apple support link? Is that an official file uploaded by some apple employee officially?\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: Yes, you can trust it. Only Apple can upload files to support.apple.com. Most of the software there is Apple-authored, although in a few cases I think there may be some third-party software that Apple has decided to supply via their server (but in those cases, I'm pretty sure Apple has checked them thoroughly). The kb page can also be found via https://support.apple.com/downloads/hp.\nAlso, if you download the the disk image, open it, and then open the installer package inside it, the Installer application will show a padlock in the top right of its window indicating that the package is signed. Click the padlock, and it'll show that it's signed with Apple's \"Software Update\" certificate. See the \"Check Installer packages\" section here for a similar screenshot (and lots more discussion about verifying code signatures).\n", "Q: How do I fix permissions on Big Sur? I think I am experiencing permission problems on my Mac. I am running an iMac with macOS Big Sur, recently updated to 11.4, though the problem has been around for a while.\nThere is one application which cannot save an existing file (though it can save a new one). As part of the trouble-shooting process, I logged in as an alternative user, and it seems to work properly. I conclude that it has something to do with who can do what.\nI have also saved the file to an external USB flash storage, which is in ExFat format. This is from my normal account. Again this works perfectly, so I conclude that saving on a volume with no specific permissions is OK. I doesn’t work if I save to an external drive formatted with HFS+ or APFS.\nThis leads me to conclude that the problem is one of permissions, possibly on the ~/Library directory.

When I reboot my MacBook Pro (11.3 now, but it's been happening for years) the reboot pauses for about a minute, after which it tells me there was a problem connecting to a certain defunct network drive. It doesn't exist and never will.\n\nThe usual advice is to locate the offending entry in Login Items and remove it. I wish I could. Below you'll see a screenshot of my Login Items, with what I presume to be the offender. It cannot be selected (the checkbox is disabled) so it cannot be removed.\nYou can also see I'm an Admin and the padlock is unlocked. Holding shift during login didn't help at all. How can I get rid of this?\n\n\nA: I had an entire answer prepped, then realised this has changed in recent macOSes\nSince High Sierra, the entire structure has been moved into what I can only call an unfathomable file.\n~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm\nI cannot make head or tail of it, however, if you throw it away it will clean your entire Login Items List.\nI discovered this at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8086931?answerId=32423169022#32423169022\nThere's a utility called Knock Knock which is very good for looking at these, but it doesn't contain any mechanism for changing them other than finding the reference in Finder. It also doesn't seem to find volumes to be mounted.\nThere's another app, Lingon which can show the list, including volumes, but again doesn't seem to want to modify it in any way [though that could be my unfamiliarity with the app]\nSo, I'd go for discarding the backgrounditems.btm file [keep a copy just in case], then recreating your Login Items manually.\n\nThis is how it used to work before High Sierra, just for historical reference.\nThe Login  Items list is store in a file in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist This es simply a text file, so you can open it in TextEdit, or for a nicer presentation, perhaps easier to follow, something like BBEdit - free version is fine.\nJust to be safe, Opt/drag a copy to the desktop, in case anything goes wrong.\nEach item in there is contained between opening & closing delineators, with each separate login item between <dict> and </dict> tags, like html or many other text/xml file types.\nSo, in theory, you should be able to find the item in the file & delete it entirely, from the opening to the closing tag.\nLike this for an example item. Note exactly where the selection is to & from, so once deleted the file doesn't break the tags at all…\n\nOnce deleted, save the file & reboot.\n\nA: It looks like this computer was administered at some point in the past - the \"Mobile\" in the user name indicating that the user is server managed. If you click on \"Login Options\" under \"Users & Groups\" is there a \"Network Account Server\" listed? That would be another indication that the users (and in some cases the machine settings) were managed by a server.\nI would create a new, local, user and then see if I received the same message logging in.\nIf you do not, then it is a user level preference from a server that is now unavailable. If this is the case, then the stack exchange question, \"Detaching from Active Directory and keeping mobile accounts\" would probably help.\nIf you still see the message, then it is probably a machine level preference. Here my advice would be to make sure you have a good backup and then wipe and reinstall. If you don't setup the machine to be connected to a server on the reinstall, any users you import should be local users - I think, haven't tested.\n", "Q: Replacement Battery: How to evaluate quality? I replaced the battery on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014), after over 2200 cycles, with a new one I bought off aliexpress. I made sure to buy the most expensive version, in order to avoid issues, I paid 75$ for a \"NOHON\" battery with good reviews.\nWhile I was inside I extradited a ton of dust bunnies, with the result of the macbook now being very quite and seemingly faster. It now probably uses less electricity than before.\nI checked coconut battery and it says that the battery is in good condition.\nHowever, it seems to me, that the battery is losing a lot of charge very fast. Only minutes after unplugging with 100% the battery is already at 97%. About two hours cost me almost half the battery.\nWhen I bought this notebook, it would basically go almost the whole day without recharge.\nSince I know, that there frequently are issues with these replacement batteries, how can I check if the battery has any? Is there anything more I can do apart from checking the health, which only says \"good\"?\nI didn't bother calibrating the battery, because from what I read, unibody batteries don't need that. I did however charge it fully and leave it plugged in for hours after it was charged.\nThe data I have access to now:\n\n\n\nA: I would run the battery through 3 full cycles and then revisit your data collection. The fact that it works and the firmware on the Mac has accepted the battery and not thrown a “service battery” or fault is a great first step.\nOnly time will tell if they voltage curve and performance of this battery of cells performs for you.\nI would quibble that calibration is needed for all batteries, but that for unibody Macs, that calibration happens as you use the battery over time, not that you have to force it by disconnecting the charger and doing the steps manually. I think it’s still valuable to repeat that old process with any suspect hardware. You won’t know how a system performs in all conditions without exposing it to all conditions. A snapshot of the health when topped off is just a snapshot whether the battery came from Apple’s supply chain and was tested before assembly or DIY like you did quite well from what you report. Great job learning how this all works and asking an excellently documented question.\n", "Q: Finder has trouble mounting folders with special characters I know in general it's bad to name files and folders with special characters.\nAs an example:\nI created a folder on our NAS and named it test% so far so good, no error on creating it like \"you can't name a folder like this\" (I remember this came up on Windows or I believe also on mac with some characters but can't figure out which right now)\nNow I copy the smb:// path of it via command + I and make it a clickable link in an email.\nSo the path is for example smb://Server/folder1/test%\nFinder opens and a small windows comes up \"Connecting to smb://Server/folder1/test%\".\nWhen I do this, the loading bar is jumping back and forth forever and nothing happens.\nWhen I do the same thing but with a folder without a special character: smb://Server/folder1/test it works and Finder can mount the folder as expected.\nIs this a bug? Can I fix it somehow (besides stopping to name folders and files like this)?\nMy Mac is currently running Big Sur 11.3.1\nQuick edit: \nI tested some more special characters like $, &,. (they work). / didn't and also I got an error that this folder doesn't exist (although it does).\nBut % displays the correct folder name in the loading bar but doesn't do anything.\n\n\nA: Without having to learn the entire illegal character list for every OS, it's best to train people to an easy subset of these rules…\nAlphanumeric only. No umlauts, etc. No spaces, use underscores.\nYou could probably make a call on Capitals, most OSes are case insensitive, so it shouldn't matter.\nDon't let them use edge cases & you won't have to fix them;) This is especially important if you have multi-platform access, as illegal characters on one OS may not be on another.\nI'd make a rule on replacing umlauts too, decide whether Müller should become Muller or Mueller & stick to it - that way people will not need three guesses to find an otherwise known name.\nUsing underscores with no spaces just makes paths simpler - no-one has to guess whether they need folder name folder\\ name folder%20name or \"folder name\" to find something, it's always folder_name.\n% is a URL escape [encoding] method as seen above, %20 means space - best to be avoided for names in URLs.\n", "Q: Why are \"spindump\" and \"sandboxd\" eating up all my CPU? I am using MacOS Big Sur 11.3 on a 2019 MacBook Pro. Recently, I started noticing that some programs (specifically MATLAB) have been running really slow, the cursor and mouse are lagging, etc. Programs other than MATLAB (e.g. Safari, Music, Photos, etc.) all work fine. This happens even when MATLAB is idle (i.e. I am not running any sort of computationally-intensive simulation).\nWhen I look at the Activity Monitor, MATLAB is consuming less than 10% CPU and <2 GB of memory. However, there are two other root processes called \"spindump\" and \"sandboxd\" which are eating up a ton of CPU. In particular, \"sandboxd\" is consuming >98% of CPU and is almost always at the top of CPU usage when running MATLAB (although occasionally disappears). The \"spindump\" process is a bit rarer but occasionally shows up eating up >40% of CPU.\nCan anyone explain why this is happening so I can decide if this might be a Mac / Apple support issue or something I should take up with MATLAB?\n\nA: I would say these are expected processes and they are designed to capture logs for analysis in the case of spin dump. I would focus on what apps are non-responsive and open a support case with each app owner.\nThe sandbox is odd, so unless MATLAB has configuration to minimize that, I would start with Apple support to see about what is driving that CPU usage. Both of those processes are needed and just like kernel_task, they respond to what is happening on the computer so you don’t “fix” them as much as understand why your workload is causing them to consume resources.  Once you nail that, you can have your battery life, heat generation and performance back. They are valuable clues as to what is happening on the system.\n", "Q: Cannot erase micro SD card Two volumes mount when it's in:\n\n\nso it looks like I partitioned it when I tried to install something on it but \"Partition\" cannot be clicked.\n\n\"Erase\" fails on both partitions:\n\nI tried the SD app called \"SD Card Formatter\" but this also didn't work.\n\nCan I wipe this Micro SD card clean, and is there a way to test it to see if it's usable (I have a lot of issues with it)?\n\nA: I was ready to follow the suggestions in the comments and put the SD Card in the .\nHowever, Steve's comment brought up the idea that a camera might be able to format the card that the computer couldn't (even though the card's firmware lock was not a result of using it in a camera).\nI tried putting the Micro SD in my Panasonic LX7 but got an error message right away (\"please reinsert the memory card\"). Then I placed the card in my Sony Nex 5 and the Sony was able to Format the card without a problem.\n\nWhen I placed the card back into the Mac, it was repaired.\nThis solved my problem, but I am grateful for the comments that led me in the right direction.\nI understand that a solution involving a mirrorless camera might not be accessible to everyone, but I would recommend to not trash SD cards that become locked after write errors, and to try formatting it in various devices that have a Format function.\n", "Q: What happened to my Macbook Air's battery? A year and half ago (in Nov. 2019) I bought a second hand Macbook Air (early 2015 model), with a new battery. At first it worked really well... but a few days ago, after only 200 battery cycles, I suddenly noticed a \"Repair battery\" warning in the status bar. After that, one day the computer shut down when it still had a 49% charge, and then I started noticing that the battery discharged itself much faster than before.\nI installed CoconutBattery, and noticed that it said that its current full capacity is only 4600 mAh, while its original design capacity was 7150 mAh. The battery is a Dynapack one and was manufactured in March 2017, but as I said above, it only has 200 cycles.\nMy questions are:\n\n*\n\n*What happened? The only explanation I can think of is that during the last year (during the lockdown) I've seldom discharged more than 10-20% of the battery in each use. Since I was at home all the time, my usage pattern was pretty much: unplug computer, use it for a couple of hours at most (until the battery was around 80-90%), and then plug it again. (Most times I just used the Macbook plugged in). Could this have affected the battery somehow?\n\n\n*Is there any way to \"Repair the battery\", as the warning says? If I take it to Apple's official store, will they \"repair\" it somehow, or will the solution be just a full replacement?\n\nA: Third-party batteries are a bit of a lottery. There's no telling how closely the specification and quality matches Apple's own parts (which they do not sell on).\nThe cycle count is a guide to the life of the battery, but that's all. A four-year-old battery is still a four-year-old battery.\nYou can take it to Apple and get a proper Apple part fitted. It will cost 'some money', but of course part of that is getting a quality product, which will be under guarantee to work properly.\nThe alternative would be for you to replace it yourself. You can get 'genuine' Apple batteries on eBay and other websites: though as said, Apple don't sell spare parts on the open market, so these are either 'run-ons' from the factory that Apple uses, (or units that didn't meet Quality checks); or they are counterfeit. So again, a bit of a lottery. Or choose a third-party supplier that you feel to be trustworthy, with a reputation for Apple peripherals and parts, rather than someone just trying to cash in on demand.\n", "Q: Kernel_task running 100%+ which is throttling the MacBook Air Thanks in advance for any and all help.

I'm speculating on the rest of this, since I can't reproduce that setup, but:\nwhen you do the diskutil mount in the first command, you will probably get a directory named \"/Volumes/HD\\ 1\". The slash after HD is just because spaces don't work in command lines, and the \"1\" is because there was already a \"/Volumes/HD\" directory, so when you did the diskutil mount you got a \"/Volumes/HD\\ 1\". That means your next command would probably be:\nsudo mount -uw /Volumes/HD\\ 1\n\nand in all following commands you would want to use\n\"/Volumes/HD\\ 1\" \n\ninstead of\n\"/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD\\ 1\"\n\nIf this doesn't work exactly for you you can dig in and see what's in /Volumes, but hopefully this helps a bit.\n", "Q: Is there a way to loop part of a video on macOS? I'm trying to learn a language from a video. For this I would like to loop part of a video indefinitely, and additionally be able to change the speed of the video while it's playing back. Is there any way to loop part of a video like this on macOS?\nThe simplest way I can think of is by trimming the video with ffmpeg or QuickTime Player, but that would become quite cumbersome with multiple parts of the video. There's also an online service called Looptube which does that that I've been using (for YouTube videos), but it's quite buggy and doesn't work at all half the time, so I've given up using it.\n\nA: One way is to open it in Quicktime Player, make the part you want a \"clip\" and set looping for that.  The help files will explain the details.\nUnfortunately, the looping stays within Quicktime—if you save the video, it still won't loop outside of Quicktime.

I am sending the files to my Mac (Early 2015 Pro, Mojave) with AirDrop. Even though the sizes of images are just shy of 3 megabytes, the \"Create PDF\" function under \"Quick Actions\" is creating ~15MB per page PDFs which is kinda painful in quick upload situations. How can I resolve this enlargement issue of Preview creating PDFs?\nThank you beforehand!\nCheers,\n~bio\n\nA: The Create PDF Quick Action (or similar Automator actions) don't have any 'controls' for the way the PDF is created, (of the kind you find in Acrobat or the PDF Export dialog of some apps). It just 'wraps' the image data in a PDF format. (I think it may also stick the image on your default printer page size.)\nIt's possible that the HEIC format, being newer, contains compression that the PDF format can't use, so it has to use a less efficient method. How large (pixels) are the images?\nIt's certainly possible to resample the image data, or increase the compression used, of a PDF: you could create a new Quick Action to create the PDF and then downsample or compress it.\nWhat's the purpose of converting them to PDF? Are you collating images together into one file?\nThere are other (dare I say better) Quick Actions for PDF manipulation, including one to Create a PDF from images, which is faster than Apple's own and preserves the images' dimensions.\nhttps://github.com/benwiggy/PDFsuite\n\nA: A PDF file usually stores an image as a separate object (an XObject) which contains the raw binary data for the image.\nThis is not generally an image in the sense of a TIFF or a JPEG – it is the binary data for the pixels, the colorspace used for the image and additional information.\nThe actual pixel data can be compressed and one of the compression formats (DCTDecode) is the same used as in a JPEG. If you save this data, it can be opened as a JPEG file, but it may need altering to include the colorspace data.\nDepending on the tool used to create the PDF your HEIC file is “converted” and included in the PDF generated.\nAnd depending on the parameters used when creating said PDF no compression might be used - besides the obvious, that is that HEIC is much more efficient for file size than the compression algorithms currently supported by Adobe’s PDF (assuming you want to keep the pixel dimensions and dpi of you original images when included). So you might end up with a large file size for your PDF.\nPDF is not a good image storage format.

Please see the attached picture.\nIn addition, today the screen went blank for a few seconds, then came back but I couldn't interact with it at all, then I had to manually restart it by pressing the on button. And tonight, my iMac just restarted itself for unknown reason.\nI used Memtest86 to scan for errors (for the whole system). After 6 hours, it found nothing, RAM included. I also used Rember software to double check if RAM are working probably, and again, found no errors. Lastly, I used Mac's diagnostics by pressing D when the computer is turning on, and it found no errors.\nThese issues never occurred during the 6 years I've been using it, only almost right after I installed these 2 pieces of RAM, so I assume the problem is the RAM.\nWhat could possibly be the problem? Is it the RAM? The RAM slots? Any advice is appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: You could always take out the RAM and see if the problem still occurs. It could just be a coincidence that the problem started after the RAM was installed, in which case you've got another problem!\n\nA: Check that the two 4GB RAM SO-DIMMS specs match precisely to the two 8GB SO-DIMMS. Specs should be exactly the same except for the RAM capacity. The RAM you bought is definitely within spec.\nMicron is very good RAM. Apple has used Micron RAM in the past. It's still possible you have some bad RAM and you would have to run the tests for many hours perhaps days to catch a failure when it happens. Definitely try taking out the two 8GB memory SO-DIMMS and see if the problem goes away after a few days of heavy use.  Also try just the two 8GB SO-DIMMS by themselves.  Then try an 8GB and a 4GB SO-DIMM and swap for the other pair. To trouble-shoot which RAM stick is bad.\nTry putting the RAM SO-DIMMS in alternating slots.  Many computers use alternate slots as channels. Slot 1 & 3 and Slot 2 & 4. It might make a difference when using different sized RAM SO-DIMM's. (Apple doesn't document this, it's just something many computers do with the slot channel arrangement) Apple might not actually do this, it's hard to tell. They list bank0/DIMM0, bank0/DIMM1, bank1/DIMM0, bank1/DIMM1 in the System Information -> Memory view.  But it is worth a try to alternate the sizes.\n4GB\n8GB\n4GB\n8GB\nInstead of\n4GB\n4GB\n8GB\n8GB\nIt will still run best with all four slots with the same sized SO-DIMMS.\n", "Q: Mac Automator variable not working as expected I've created a workflow in Automator that isn't working as expected.\nI started with an 'ask for text' action and a 'set value of variable' action (ProductCode).

This really has nothing to do with Time Machine.\nThere's a variety of ways to deal with this scenario.  You can clone the Photos partition to the second external drive using Disk Utility (restore function), command line dd tool, or a 3rd party tool such as SuperDuper! or CarbonCopyCloner. Some of which depends on the version of macOS you are running as the 3rd party software may only support Catalina or Big Sur on their latest versions.\nIf this is something you need to regularly run as a backup, I would recommend the commercial software such as CarbonCopyCloner to make it point and click easy.\nIn Disk Utility, attach both external drives, select the 2nd external drive where you will be copying the Photos partition to and click on Restore and then select the Photos partition on the first drive.  This will effectively clone the partition.\nIf you wish to do it from the command line in Terminal you need to first determine the drives identification.  /dev/disk3/disk3s2, etc. Use the command diskutil list to list all the drives and volumes (partitions) and be absolutely sure you understand which disk is which and that you make zero typos or you could clone the wrong thing or worse clone in the wrong direction effectively wiping out your data.  This is very powerful, rather straightforward but it is very unforgiving if you make a tragic mistake.\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk1/disk1s2 of=/dev/disk2/disk2s1 bs=100M\n\nAssuming you have 3 disks attached, /dev/disk0 would be your macOS Macintosh HD drive and supporting volumes (partitions).  /dev/disk1 would be the first Time Machine drive with the Photos volume (partition). The photos partition is likely the second partition /dev/disk1/disk1s2. The destination is /dev/disk2/disk2s1 creating a clone of /dev/disk1/disk1s2 on the first partition on the second disk /dev/disk2/disk2s1.\n\nThis is ONLY AN EXAMPLE, you need to determine what the correct disk identifiers are for your particular setup as they will likely vary.\nFor the technical people, cloning a drive from the command line for free allows for scripting and a DIY attitude.  But using software such as CarbonCopyCloner is far easier, less error prone, and worth every penny if you do this all the time. The latest version of CCC was recently updated and one of the main features was increased performance with a new multi-threaded file-copier. It may be a better choice over Time Machine as well. Depends on your particular needs.\n", "Q: Change the quota size for an APFS volume I created one APFS Container for the whole of my external hard drive.\nI created several volumes in that - some with quotas.\nI have now discovered that one quota is now too small. I used diskutil apfs list /dev/disk10 to show me the Capacity consumed and the Capacity Quota.\nHow do I change the quota for an APFS volume under BigSur?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no way to change an APFS reserveSize nor QuotaSize without destroying the APFS volume and recreating it.

The Linux installer usually exists on a bootable flash drive. The installer also puts Linux boot files in the hidden EFI partition. Here, I assume this is how you installed Kali.\n\nThe proper method to uninstall Linux is to do the reverse. Use the Linux installer to remove the Linux partitions, then use macOS to reclaim the drive space created when the the Linux partitions were removed. You can use macOS or the Linux installer to remove the Linux boot files from the hidden EFI partition.\n\nHowever, when you use macOS Disk Utility application or diskutil command to remove a Linux partition, Apple punishes you by changing the GUID Partition Table (GPT) type  to FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF for the partition where macOS is stored. You can see this in image you posted, which is shown below after cropping. This change prevents macOS from booting. Also, macOS will not appear in the Mac Startup Manager.\n\nThe steps given below first removes the Linux swap partition (disk0s3) from the GPT. Next, the partition containing macOS is removed from the GPT. This does not alter the contents of the of the APFS container where macOS is stored. Finally, the partition containing macOS is added back to the GPT with the correct type of 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC. (If interested, a list of common partition types is given here.) The values of 409640 and 125000000, used in step 2, where taken from an image you posted, which is shown below after cropping.\n\n\nOnce the partition containing macOS has the correct type, macOS should appear in the Mac Startup Manager. (The Mac Startup Manager icons appear when you hold down the option at startup.)\n\nFollow the steps given below to fix the GPT.\n\n*\n\n*Use the key combination Option-⌘-R to boot to macOS Recovery over the Internet.\n\n\n*Enter the commands below in a Terminal application window.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk0\ngpt remove -i 3 disk0\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk0\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 125000000 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\n\n\n*Boot back to macOS.\n\n\n*Enter the command given below to recover the free space.\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nNote: Your Mac may still have the Linux boot files stored in the hidden EFI partition.

I have MacBookPro provided by my employer and I like to use it mostly for official purpose. However for productivity reason I do need to login into my personal account, for instance paying bills or even just voting 1up an helpful answer on stack exchange.\nKeeping all that in mind, you may understand why I won't connect this Mac to personal account at system level but I wish I can login to safari and get facilities like bookmarks, keychain.\nI know chrome lets you login just at browser level, is their a similar functionality in safari.\n\nA: Safari relies on iCloud to sync the keychain, bookmarks, open tabs, etc. Most employers block iCloud for security reasons. iCloud Drive is something they do not wish to allow. For a given user account on macOS you have one login keychain and an iCloud keychain. You cannot login to Safari with a different user account and sync data like you can with Chrome or Microsoft Edge or FireFox.  However, employers can definitely block you from doing even that. There are enterprise management features in every browser that allows the employer to restrict browser extensions and the ability to login as a different user to the browser, etc.\nThe computer is owned by your employer and they are managing the device remotely.  Normally users are not granted local administrative privileges. Developers, engineers, technicians and SysAdmins might have an extra user account with local admin but everything they do with it is logged in depth. Some employers might require a user to request local admin privileges for a limited period of time and they need to justify the business reason for the elevated access privileges.  The company Mac will be checking in with an MDM (Mobile Device Management) Server where it receives instructions in the form of Configuration Profiles, policies that run scripts, software updates, and there is typically a company AppStore solution.  The Mac may connect to Apple using a company Apple ID. In most cases, a company will block iCloud entirely. They may block the Apple AppStore.  They may block browser extensions even on Chrome / Edge / FireFox. There's been a lot of nasty evil browser extensions that spy on you or could otherwise compromise company security. There's a lot of malware that uses browser extensions. They might force the Mac to connect to a cloud proxy such as Zscaler that forces you to authenticate before you can browse the Internet without VPN. This has become popular since the pandemic sent everyone to work from home. They might restrict connecting external storage over USB/Thunderbolt and connecting to non-company controlled network shares.  They most certainly will prevent incoming SSH connections.\nRead your Employee Manual and Information Technology usage policies. You are only to use the device for work purposes.  The company can and probably does monitor your activity for suspicious behavior and even productivity. They can see absolutely everything. Every email you send and receive is kept in a vault and it doesn't matter if you deleted the email on your Mac. Internal chat systems are also logged. Some countries and regulatory agencies actually require logging of email and chats and if a court demanded that data and the company could not provide it there will be hefty financial penalties. Many industries are regulated to retain data for differing periods of time.\nMost employers are rather relaxed but some can be downright draconian.  Other employers might not be tracking everything but if you were to raise a red flag that in some way made them feel you were putting the company at risk then they most certainly could open an investigative case and start collecting a lot more data. Those that work for defense contractors or large financial firms with access to customer private data or other proprietary secret data have to be extra cautious what they do on the company computers. Not only can you get fired, you can be legally prosecuted.\nCompanies will monitor their computers for unapproved usage, hacking activity, data loss / leakage of intellectual property and private customer data. Error logs can be sent to a centralized server for analysis. They can collect your browser history both from your Mac but also at the network level. Even if you clear your cache on the browser they still know where and when you were surfing every website you connected to.\nMost employers will respect their employees privacy while others will not. There should be zero expectation of any privacy while using a company issued computer. Big Brother is watching you if not in real time they will still have logs and history they can review if you draw their attention.  In large companies there are IT security departments and they keep things confidential when running an investigation.  On top of protecting the company and customer data they also look for fraudulent activity such as theft or money laundering.\nIT security departments do not talk about their investigations but you would be amazed at what happens on a regular basis. Employees do remarkably dumb things all the time.\nDo not put personal data of any kind on work computers that you do not wish the company to see. Again, there is ZERO PRIVACY on a work issued computer.\nJust use your personal devices for personal use. Keep work on work devices. Use an iPad or something instead of the work issued computer.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a monthly budget vs actuals chart on MacOS Numbers?

The container has 250.8 GB of space, disk1s1 is taking up 205.8 GB of that, disk1s2 is taking 426.9 MB (= 0.4269 GB), etc\nSo the sum of space taken by the volumes in the disk1 container (in GB) is 205.8 + 0.4269 + 0.6139 + 6.4 + 15.1 = 228.34. Note that the 15.1 MB only counts once, because disk1s5s1 is just a snapshot of disk1s5, so they at-least-mostly are just different ways of viewing the same data and it's only stored once.\nNow, 228.34 GB from 250.8 GB leaves 22.46 GB (= 20.92 GiB), which doesn't quite match up with the 18 GiB of free space reported by df. I'm not sure why there's a difference there. It may be there's some filesystem overhead that isn't counted in the space taken up by the individual volumes. Also, I suppose it's possible the snapshot of the startup disk actually has been modified slightly, so disk1s5 and disk1s5s1 don't completely share space (which would be weird, but who knows)?\n", "Q: \"Install Labview 2020 sp1 community \" cannot be opened because apple cannot check it for malicious software I recently upgrade to the newest Macbook pro M1, from a 2018 intel model.

I could only find one thread that treat this matter but doesn't really help much in my case. So would greatly appreciate any insight from here.\n\nA: Apps that are not distributed via the AppStore now require Notarization on top of being signed by a paid Apple Developer ID which means the developer must submit their application to Apple for review so that Apple can issue a notarization signature the developer can \"staple\" apply to the App. Otherwise you will see that warning and the App will not run by default.\nTo work around the problem: Open the /Applications folder with Finder.  Right-click the LabVIEW application icon and select Open.  A dialog will appear and you can allow the App to open. The App might immediately quit, try opening the App normally and this time it should work.\nSend an email to the software vendor and ask them to Notarize their App for the newer macOS versions.

The commands below were run on Catalina. Most related questions and answers are for older versions of macOS which work a bit differently, but even then I have not found an exact answer to my question.\nAs I explained here, I want to increase the ulimit -n (max open files) for the Terminal program when launched from the Finder or when automatically started when logging in as part of restoring open windows. Even though I have performance mode turned on, the default ulimit -n is only 256, and most Terminal windows take up 2 file slots: 1 for the shell and one for the \"Saved Application State\" file, limiting me to around 128 windows, which sometimes is not enough.\nThe only way I have found to change the ulimit for the Terminal is via\nsudo launchctl limit maxfiles <soft-limit> <hard-limit>\n\nI would like to set the soft limit to something bigger than 256 but still reasonably small, like 512 or 1000. I would like to leave the hard limit unlimited. Unfortunately, I found out that you cannot set the hard limit to \"unlimited\", but that is OK, I can set it to an appropriately high number. I checked the kernel limits (remember, I have performance mode enabled):\n$ sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc kern.maxfiles\nkern.maxfilesperproc: 600000\nkern.maxfiles: 1200000\n\nIt seemed reasonable to me to set the hard limit to kern.maxfilesperproc, so I ran\nsudo launchctl limit maxfiles 999 600000\n\nat which point several programs immediately crashed. I found that this did not just set the ulimit, it also set the kernel parameters, and not the way I expected:\n$ sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc kern.maxfiles\nkern.maxfilesperproc: 999\nkern.maxfiles: 600000\n\nSo programs with more than 1000 files open crashed. Obviously, those programs knew they were going to need to have a lot of files open and adjusted their resource limits appropriately, which is fine, and I need to keep that. On the other hand, programs like Terminal can get into loops that consume resources until they run out, so I want to keep soft limits for those programs low.\nI tried setting ulimit in /etc/bashrc and /etc/zshrc but those only affect their respective shells, not commands like Terminal that are launched by the Finder/launchd.\nIs there some way I can adjust the default soft limit for number of open files (ulimit -Sn, setrlimit()) for Terminal (or system-wide) without also changing the kernel parameter kern.maxfilesperproc (sysctl)?\n\nA: This answer requires a bit of explanation about how these limits actually work:\nIn general these types of resource limits come with a soft limit and a hard limit. The soft limit means that a process will receive a signal notifying it whenever it exceeds that limit. The hard limit means that the process cannot exceed this limit no matter how hard it tries.\nA process is allowed to change its own resource limits at runtime. The soft limit can be raised up to the hard limit, and lowered as much as wanted. However, the hard limit can generally only be lowered. Only the superuser (\"root\") is allowed to raise the hard limit.\nThe limit on the maximum number of simultaneously open files is enforced by the kernel. Whenever a process tries to open a file (or duplicate a file descriptor, etc) the kernel will check whether this means that the process exceeds the current limit. If so, the process will either receive a signal (for the soft limit) - or the attempt to open/duplicate/etc will fail (for the hard limit).\nNote that this means that when you change the limit during runtime, nothing really happens besides the kernel storing the new limit in its data structures. If the limit is lowered and that means that processes are now exceeding their new limit, nothing happens. The processes will not receive a signal for the soft limit, and files will not be closed or the process terminated for the hard limit. However, when the process attempts to open new files, they will either receive a signal or the open attempt will fail.\nAnother important property of these resource limits is that they're inherited when a new process is forked. This means that when a process with a limit of X starts a new child-process C1, that child-process C1 will also have a limit of X. If the process later changes its limit to Y, and starts a new child-process C2, this child-process C2 will also have a limit of Y.\nThe macOS kernel is structured so that the lowest level is a Mach kernel - on top of this is layered a BSD subsystem for enabling a Unix userland. Note that these resource limits only apply to processes in this BSD subsystem of the kernel. All the processes you normally interact with on a daily basis are such BSD processes.\nDuring boot of the system, the Mach kernel initializes the BSD subsystem in a function known as bsd_init(). In this function, the kernel sets the default (i.e. starting) limits for new processes. Among these it sets the default soft limit for number of open files per process to be 256. This value is hard coded into the kernel executable and cannot be configured on runtime. This is why on a default system, you'll see that launchctl limit will report maxfiles as 256.\nYou can configure that value by compiling your own kernel. Again, this will typically wreak havoc with various integrity protections such as Secure Boot, but it is doable. After downloading the kernel source code, but before compiling it, you'll want to change the file bsd/sys/param.h in approx. line 101, which says:\n#define NOFILE  256  /* default max open files per process */\n\nNote that this will change the default limits for not only Terminal.app, but also everything else.\nIn addition to the limit values stored by the kernel in its data structures for each process, there's also a set of matching kernel parameters. In this scenario, that's for example the kern.maxfilesperproc parameter that can be changed with sysctl. This parameter sets the limit for the first process created in the system - i.e. the root of the inheritance tree. Even though the process is running with superuser privileges, it won't be able to change its own resource limits using setrlimit() above that ceiling (without first raising the ceiling using sysctl).\nIn Unix-like systems and thus also BSD systems, this specific process is generally known as the \"init\" process. Historically this was a program named initd. On macOS the role of the init process is actually performed by launchd.\nThis is why when you use launchctl to set a new limit for maxfiles, you actually end up changing these kernel parameters. Afterall, those are the limits to be enforced for the init process (launchd). As they're stored as kernel parameters, instead of in a per-process data structure, they will be persisted even if the init process (launchd) should crash and be restarted. launchd is itself responsible for this, as it doesn't just call the usual setrlimit() system call to change its resource limits when you use the limit parameter with launchctl - it actually also runs sysctl() directly.\nlaunchd being the root of the inheritance tree means that when you change its limits, this will actually have an effect on all processed to be started on the system. As you want to target the Terminal process specifically, this is not what you want.\nIf you take a look at Activity Monitor, search for the Terminal process and click the info-button - you'll see that it actually lists launchd as the direct parent of Terminal. This means that there's nothing \"in between\" launchd and Terminal whose resource limits you could have changed to get an effect on Terminal.\nOn Linux it is possibly via the prlimit() system call (commonly using the command line tool prlimit) to change the resource limits of an another given process. Sadly, Linux is quite alone in having this system call - it is not found on other Unix systems, including macOS. If we had this system call on macOS, you could just use a tool like prlimit to set the limits you wanted for the ´Terminal`.\nYou could possibly try changing the resource limits for the program that ultimately runs Terminal.app for you. For example you could change /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.WindowServer.plist and add a SoftResourceLimits key with a dictionary holding a NumberOfFileskey set to the integer value of the limit you want. However that limit would apply to every process run by the graphical subsystem, and not only Terminal.app.\nAll this boils down to the fact that if you want to change the resource limits for Terminal specifically, you need to get the Terminal process to do that itself (i.e. it needs to call setrlimit() itself). Unfortunately there's no option in its Settings or anything like that to set this resource limit.\nThat leaves you with only one clear solution: You need to change the code of Terminal in order to set the resource limit. That is often done using so called \"code injection\". This could for example take the form of injecting a dynamic library using DYLD environment variables. However, it is generally a pain to do this on more modern macOS systems, as you will be hindered by SIP (System Integrity Protection) - and various other types of protections, especially on Apple's own programs. It is however doable if you're willing to disable these protections.\nCommonly it is not the worth the time, effort and risk involved - and it is easier to simply set the general resource limit so high that you can open the number of Terminal tabs you want - even though that also means that other processes will have a similar higher limit.\nA practical work-around might be to simply copy Terminal.app so that you can have 2 sets of Terminals running. It's not perfect, but it would allow you double the amount of tabs without changing any system settings.\nYou could also live with having to launch Terminal.app via another program that sets the resource limit. For example you could create a small shell script that sets the limit and then launches Terminal.app. It would mean that this shell is kept around while you have the Terminal open, but might be worth it for your scenario.\n", "Q: In Preview, what properties are the top three level sliders? What am I actually adjusting when I move around these three sliders in the \"Adjust Color\" setting?\n\n\nA: The control is a histogram, also called \"levels\". When you adjust the sliders, you are adjusting the exposure of the image.\nPhoto editing technique is probably out of scope of Ask Different, but you can read more about it in Apple's documentation for Photos: https://support.apple.com/guide/photos/apply-levels-adjustments-pht362f9034f/6.0/mac/11.5\n", "Q: Can no longer send a photo from camera roll to a shared album iPhone SE, iOS 14.5.1\nFor years I have made a new Shared Library every year with the year in the title, to share with my other half.  This has always worked, and she has a shared library of photos I have sent her for each of the last 7-8 years or so.  But I recently upgraded my OS (always a scary proposition with Apple) and I can no longer share photos from the camera roll, to a shared album!  The option simply doesn't appear.  I can email them, send them via Messages, AirDrop, Dropbox, Google Drive, and a ton of other things.  But there is no option anywhere that I can see, to add the selected photos to a shared album.\nAlbum Sharing is enabled, iCloud is working, etc.\nHow can I add a photo to a shared album in iOS 14.5.1?\n\nA: Open settings, tap your name, tap iCloud, tap Photos and make sure \"Shared albums\" are turned on. If it already are on, restart the Photos app (double tap home button and swipe up the Photos app in the app switcher) and look for the \"Add to shared album\" option you found missing earlier. If the option is still missing try to turn the \"Shared album\" option off in settings, reboot you iPhone then turn it on again then reboot it once more.\nMake sure that the file type of the photo is supported. According to Apple, following formats are supported in Shared Albums:\nImages:\n\n*\n\n*HEIF\n\n*JPEG\n\n*RAW*\n\n*PNG\n\n*GIF\n\n*TIFF\n\n*Not supported on Windows.\nVideos:\n\n*\n\n*HEVC\n\n*MP4\n\n*QuickTime\n\n*H.264\n\n*MPEG-4\n\nThe way you try to add photos to a shared album is the correct way, according to Apple support article.

Every time I download and install software onto my Mac, it mounts a drive with the name of that application. E.g., I installed the IntelliJ IDEA IDE (see the picture below). Every time I then have to eject that drive. Is there a way to disable this?\n\n\nA: Most non-App Store software applications are delivered as a DMG file. A DMG file (with the file extension .dmg) is a file whose content looks just like a small disk.\nThe DMG is downloaded to your Downloads folder and is opened (automatically or by double clicking).  Since the content looks like a small disk, Finder mounts it as if it were a real disk.\nYou then install the software by, for example, dragging the application  from within the mounted disk to /Applications.\nAfterwards the DMG remains mounted until you eject it.\nHistorically the DMG format is a disk like container for Internet downloads where in times past you would have purchased a physical disk (e.g. a DVD, CD or floppy disk). Since a DMG behaves in the same way as a physical disk it requires ejection when you are finished with it.\n\nA: This is the conventional way for installing software on macOS.\n\n*\n\n*The software is provided on an Apple Disk Image (the .dmg file), the purpose of which is to emulate a physical disk (CD, floppy, etc.) and provide compression if needed (like a ZIP archive). This is functionally very similar to an ISO file (used a lot on Windows) but very different in nature (see What is the difference between ISO and DMG images? for more information).\n\n*Once downloaded, you open the .dmg file which will mount the disk image and make it appear as a removable drive.\n\n*The installation process usually consists of copying the Application Bundle (.app) from inside the drive to your Application folder, the disk image usually contains a shortcut to the local Application folder for this very purpose (to drag & drop).\n\n*Once finished, you are supposed to eject the drive (which will unmount the disk image) and disposed of the image file if no longer required.\n\nThis is a just the conventional way that macOS users are accustomed to but not all software follow this procedure :\n\n*\n\n*Software from the App Store doesn't follow this procedure but are installed automatically in the background.\n\n*Some software are provided on an Installer Package File (.pkg) which once open makes the users go through an installation wizard, very similar to an .exe or .msi installer on Windows.\n\n*Some software are provided as an .app in a ZIP archive, which (following the default behaviour of Safari and Finder) is automatically uncompressed leaving you with only the .app that can be moved from the Download folder to the Application folder without a disk image.\n\nIt is in the hand of the software provider to decide how they want to distribute their application. If they provide you with a .dmg file, you'll have to mount and unmount it, there is not much you can do on your side.\nIf you are more accustomed to a package manager approach (like in linux distributions), you may take a look at Homebrew. It is initially designed for open-source CLI software, but its Cask extension allow for command line management of graphical application (including IntelliJ IDEA for example, you can check if your software is supported here).\n\nA: Just tacking on a few points to the existing answers:\nE-mail, web-forms, etc. typically don't let you transmit folders. Mac apps are actually bundles, not files. Bundles are like folders, except that they have a pretty icon, a fancy double-click action (which launches the app, versus opening the folder), extra metadata, and so on.\nSo this is a problem, you can't transmit these over a lot of internet technologies, because they're not singular files.\nFor that reason, several technologies were created to convert folder structures into singular files, such as compressed files, .tar tarballs, and indeed, .dmg disk images.\nDMGs also have the added benefit of being able to store a background image, icon layout, etc. On the downside, they can't be extracted in a single click as you could with e.g. a zip file.\n\nA: The DMG metaphor will make a lot more sense if you remember that when OS X was released in 2001, most users installed new software via optical discs. They would buy a copy of Microsoft Office (perhaps from RadioShack), insert the CD, click the new volume that appeared on their desktop, and drag Microsoft Word.app to their Applications folder. Afterwards, they would presumably want to eject the CD, put it back in its case, and store it safely away in the back closet.\nOf course, some users also installed software via the internet. So Apple, ever trying to keep the UX consistent, came up with an equivalent workflow—users could download \"virtual\" CDs in the form of .dmg files, and \"insert\" them with a double click. It was quite clever, really, and indicative of the excellent work Apple was doing at the time.\nToday, when 99.99% of software is downloaded via the internet, this process is perhaps in need of a rethink.\n", "Q: Utility to test/quantify/document intermittent network problems? I’ve had recurring network problems for a while on my MacBook — I get very frequent dropped connections. This has happened on multiple wi-fi networks, and also when using my iPhone’s internet sharing (either over USB, or as a wi-fi hotspot).  On the same networks, I’ve had friends with MacBooks (both older and younger than mine) who didn’t have such issues; so I’m fairly confident the problem is (at least partly) my MacBook, not the networks.\nThe issue shows up most clearly and disruptively in video-calls — in Zoom, FaceTime, and Teams, the connection gets major outages (long enough to completely disrupt conversation, and sometimes enough for the program to disconnect entirely) pretty frequently — sometimes every couple of minutes, sometimes less often.  In 2021, this of course causes pretty serious problems…\nI’ve attempted a lot of troubleshooting suggestions, and also had an Apple Store appointment where they ran the Network Diagnostics and also checked over the hardware — none of this solved or located the issue.  The biggest difficulty in troubleshooting is simply testing whether the issue is still occurring, since it’s so intermittent.  The only way to judge whether it’s occurring is video-calls (or similar things, like online gaming), and it takes multiple minutes of constant attention, and even then is often subjective, since some amount of lag/skipping is of course normal.\nSo: Is there a utility that can test/monitor the network connection continuously over a period of time, and record/present the results readably?  I can imagine trying to roll my own version with a script that runs ping at regular intervals — but that seems pretty primitive, and it seems like a more sophisticated version must be out there.  Can anyone recommend such a tool?\n\nA: For network admins, the go-to tool is often Smokeping. However it is not available as a GUI program on macOS.\nInstead you could consider an app named PingPlotter that similarly gives you a historical overview of the absolute ping times, jitter and packet loss. Note that it is a commercial app, but there is a free 14-day trial available.\nIf you rather want a free and open-source alternative, I would take a lok at Pingnoo.\n", "Q: Keychain Access app opens on login Big Sur. Did not set as login item For the past day, Keychain Access has been opening on login on my M1 MacBook Air running Big Sur 11.3. Did not set it as a login item.\nWhat could be the cause and what should I do to check for any security issues that caused or could result from this? No one else uses this machine but me.\n\nA: When you have log in and see Keychain running, try right-clicking its icon in the dock. Under \"Options\", you'll find \"Open at Login\" - make sure it is not checked.\nThen right-click the dock icon again and select \"Quit\" to ensure that the application is fully closed.\nNow you can log out and login again, and hopefully Keychain Access won't start up automatically.\n", "Q: How to take hourly screenshots on an iPad? Does the iPad have the ability to take screenshots every X amount of time? How can I make the iPad take screenshots automatically?\n\nA: You can use the automation feature in the Shortcuts App to take a screenshot at a specific time. It supports daily repeats, but you‘ll need to create an automation for each hour you want to have a record of.\n", "Q: Create a location on my Mac where iCloud will not be used I am using iCloud on my mac. I am wildly uncomfortable that it sees the Documents and Desktop folder in my account.\nCan I create a folder or folders myself where iCloud will not be used?\n\nA: You can either\n\n*\n\n*turn off iCloud storage for Documents and Deskop in System Preferences\n\nor\n\n*\n\n*create a new folder \"Local Documents\" in your home folder for documents you don't want to syncronize with iCloud\n\n", "Q: Bootcamp partition space disappeared after removal through Bootcamp Assistant failed I'm running macOS 11.3.1 on my 2013 MacBook Air and wanted to remove my Bootcamp and reclaim the space. Had around 40GB free on my macOS partition and the Bootcamp one was 50GB. So I ran the Bootcamp Assistant to remove the partition - thing is, it froze mid-process and the computer stopped responding, even the curson stopped moving. So I powered it off with the button, powered it on again and now there is neither the Bootcamp partition nor its space anywhere to be seen as it did not get reclaimed by the macOS partition.

For posteriority: in the end the fix was to go to the Disk Utility (I used the GUI one) and try creating a new FAT partition. A full-sized one didn't work in my case (There is not enough free space in this APFS Container for this operation. : (-69605)) so I chose 40GB (even though the size selector text box is greyed out you can still use the circle dials on the left hand side).\nThis caused an error to occur again, this time later in the process (no error code, just \"internal error occurred, try again later\") but a new 40GB partition still appeared in disk utility (albeit an exFAT one instead of the FAT we choose in the beginning). So I tried removing it through the same partitioning dialog I created it with in disk utility, and then somehow magically my main macOS partition started having full 90GB of free space instead of the 40GB it had before with 50GB floating in the abyss.\nSo all's good now, thanks for all the other replies!\n", "Q: iTunes backup button greyed out The backup button in the summary page of my iPhone on iTunes is greyed out. There's plenty of storage space in the laptop, and the backups work with other accounts. I'm working with an iPhone 8 running iOS 14.5 and macos 10.12. other iPhones aren't working either.\n\nA: Typically on Sierra, the first time you connect a phone running iOS 13 or iOS 14, you're supposed to get a prompt telling you that there's a minor software update that iTunes needs to do with a button to accept it. Do you remember seeing anything like that? You may need to unlock your iPhone first before the Mac realizes it's there and prompts you about it.\nIf not, here's an apple discussion thread about how to force that little update to happen - curious to see if that helps:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/250674376\nAccording to that thread:\n\nIn Finder use the menu item Go > Go to Folder..., copy the following\ntext, paste it into the dialog box and press enter:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileDevice.framework/Versions/Current/Resources\nUnlock your device and connect it to USB.

of death of your computer in terms of actually damaging the hardware.\nThe problem is almost certainly a software bug. It could be a hardware error as welll, but it is unlikely.\nIt is impossible to give you the exact \"problem description\" from just the information given in your question. However, you can get quite a few details from the panic report itself:\nIn rough terms, the panic reports details that the memory management unit responsible for I/O raised an unexpected error while attempting a read from memory (RAM).\nHere's an explanation for some of the terms found in the first line of the panic report:\ndart-disp0: \"Device Address Resolution Table\" for display controller 0\nSMMU: \"System Memory Management Unit\"\nSID: \"stream id\"\nPTE: \"Page table entry\"\nDVA: \"Device virtual address\"\nThe DART is really an memory management unit specifically for I/O (i.e. peripherals) - and it has to cooperate with the main system memory management unit in order to, well, manage memory. The purpose of an I/O memory management unit is to facilitate access to main memory for peripherals - for example when doing DMA transfers - which is basically devices accessing main memory directly without participation of the CPU. Essentially this makes it possible to have devices access main memory in a performant way, while stay obeying restrictions and mappings set up by the operating system (such as for example address translation, read-only zones, etc).\nOn ARM systems, the stream ID is basically a number that makes it possible for the IOMMU (DART) to make lookups in the stream table to find the mappings and configuration relevant for a specific peripheral device.\nThe page table entry is a generic terms for a configuration of a memory management unit that maps adresses from virtual address space into physical address space.\nThe device virtual address is simply a memory address given by the peripheral, before it is eventually translated into a physical memory address by the IOMMU.\nIn simpler terms this means that somehow a read from memory initiated by a peripheral device related to the display controller triggered an unexpected error. That could be a bug in the operating system, or more likely it would be a driver bug where some page table configuration made with the IOMMU is incorrect. It could also be a problem with a hub or display that does \"something\" out of spec that wasn't anticipated by Apple - although I would classify it is a macOS bug that the system crashes like this.\nIn terms of what you can do yourself - I would advise trying to use the computer without the hub for a while. Does this stop the kernel panics? - If so, contact the vendor for support and/or replace the hub with something else. I would also report the bug to Apple as you do not seem to have third party drivers (kernel extensions) loaded in. Also as soon as a software update is available for macOS, I would load that in to see if a fix was included.\n\nA: its a hub/monitor issue. same issue myself. i used my MacBook without the hub/monitor adapter for 3 months straight and never an issue. that is how I I know for sure.\n", "Q: How do I stop word splitting in bash for loop? When I run the command below:\nmdfind -name iMazing\nI get the following output:\n/Users/apple/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/iMazing.Versions\n/Users/apple/Library/Application Support/com.DigiDNA.iMazing2Mac\n\nI want to run a for a loop to delete these dirs.\nBefore doing so I tested with ls:\nfor i in $(mdfind -name); do ls \"$i\"; done\nOutput:\nls: /Users/apple/Library/Application: No such file or directory\nls: Support/MobileSync/Backup/iMazing.Versions: No such file or directory\nls: /Users/apple/Library/Application: No such file or directory\nls: Support/com.DigiDNA.iMazing2Mac: No such file or directory\n\nAs you can see word splitting has happened because of the space in Application Support\nI tried the following variations:\n\"${i}\"\nEscaping the quotes:\n\"\\\"$i\"\\\"\n\"\\\"${i}\"\\\"\nto no avail, any ideas?\nEDIT:\nSo IFS does not matter, what's going on?:\n kn: (master)  \n λ  IFS=; for i in $(mdfind -name iMazing); do ls \"$i\"; done\nls: /Users/apple/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/iMazing.Versions\n/Users/apple/Library/Application Support/com.DigiDNA.iMazing2Mac: No such file or directory\n  kn: (master)  \n λ  while IFS= read -r i; do ls \"$i\"; done < <(mdfind -name iMazing)\nBlueprints  Readme.txt  Temp        Trash       Versions\ncom.microsoft.appcenter\n  kn: (master)  \n λ  while read -r i; do ls \"$i\"; done < <(mdfind -name iMazing)\nBlueprints  Readme.txt  Temp        Trash       Versions\ncom.microsoft.appcenter\n\n\nA: The problem is not the quoting of $i — that's too late.\nThe for loop has already split the input by spaces, so each for loop iteration is being given one of the four components shown in the errors. You need to fix the loop instead.\nYou can do this by setting IFS, the Internal Field Separator, to newline.\nIFS=$'\\n'; for i in $(mdfind -name iMazing); do ls \"$i\"; done\nIFS is how bash determines how to split input. By default, it includes space, so each space in each line of the input is split into two inputs, alongside the existing new lines, causing 4 loops rather than 2. Setting IFS to new line only turns off this splitting by space, preserving each line of input without additional splitting.\n\nA potentially preferable way of looping over lines of output is using read -r line:\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do echo rm -R \"$line\"; done < <(mdfind -name iMazing)\n\nUnix.SE has a good breakdown of IFS= read -r line:\n\n*\n\n*Understanding “IFS= read -r line”\n\nA: If you just want to pass the results to a single command (not run a sequence of commands, or anything complex like that), you can use xargs. If the command can take a bunch of filenames at once, use something like this:\nmdfind -0 -name iMazing | xargs -0 ls\n\nThe -0 options make the commands use null bytes as delimiters; since these cannot occur in filenames, this is safe against all the usual confusions.\nNote: if you're going to use this with something dangerous, like rm, I recommend running it with something safe, like ls, to make sure it's going to do what you want. (And... you have a good backup, right?) If you want to be really careful, add the -p option (after xargs, but before the command to be executed) and it'll print the command and ask for confirmation before running it.\nAlso, if the command can't take a bunch of filenames at once, add -n 1 (again, after xargs but before the command).\n\nA: If you install a version of bash >= 4.0 (say, with Homebrew), you can do:\nmapfile -t files < <(mdfind -name iMazing)\n\nwhich reads the lines of the mdfind output into the \"files\" array. Then\nfor file in \"${files[@]}\"; do ls \"$file\"; done\n\n", "Q: Keeping a process always running even when M1 Mac is sleeping I would like to keep a process \"always on\" as some specific iOS apps (such as navigation or music apps) are able to, even when the Mac is put to sleep.

I am using Brave Browser version 1.24.86 Chromium: 90.0.4430.212 (Official Build) (x86_64) on Catalina 10.15.5\nUsing a large 4K display with the browser on the right side, it's quite annoying that new popup windows appear top-left.\n\nA: This may be a bit of an over-engineered solution, but you could use an app like Keyboard Maestro (or something else similar). Create a macro that will open a new window at a certain position on the screen. Then, in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts change the \"New Window\" menu item to a different keyboard shortcut and set your other macro to trigger with ⌘N. This way, you don't have to change your behavior at all, but a new Brave window will open exactly where you want it. I'm sure there is other window management software that will do something similar.\n", "Q: Cannot ping/access mac in same network The title says it all, i am going insane...\ntried all of that and none where working\n\n*\n\n*disable firewall\n\n*sudo pfctl -s all\n\n*restart\n\n*fix IP Address\n\n*changed Router to hotspot to get different IPS\n\n*disabled all launch-agents\n\n*NO VPN installed\n\n*ping @ mac-name.local\n\ndid a\nsudo tcpdump 'icmp[icmptype] = icmp-echo or icmp[icmptype] = icmp-echoreply'\nwhich gives me\n11:40:38.011922 IP 192.168.0.137 > 192.168.0.80: ICMP echo request, id 28937, seq 814, length 64\nand as far as i understood, that means the request is coming in, but somehow blocked.\nI can ping my other macbook from the machine i am trying to access\n\nping 192.168.0.137\nPING 192.168.0.137 (192.168.0.137): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 192.168.0.137: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=48.151 ms\n\nI can even ping the other macbook from windows, i can also ping to a windows laptop.\nThe one i need, is not pingable or accessible from anywhere.

After installing a software called KnockKnock I figured out that I have three applications (one of them called 'cpfw.kext', which is Check Point Software and that is VPN software) Installed as Kernel-Extensions. I simply deleted those files (cpfw.kext, acsock.kext, HoRNDIS.kext), rebooted and after that my mac was accessible again from any pc in the same network.\nHere you see a picture from my linux machine connecting to the mac via VNC :-) (Plus the deleted files..)\n\n\nA: The source machine probably has the router as a caching DNS server, which goes to the DNS network looking for “who handles *.local addresses?” And gets no answer.\n", "Q: iMac that slow - is that normal? I have a iMac Retina4K from the end of 2015 with 3.1GHz Quad-Core i5 and 8GB DDR3 on 21\" with a second monitor attached, and a HDD-disk. macOS is Catalina and I am running Firefox, Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator most of the time. Since I upgraded to Catalina my Mac is soooo slow that starting up in the morning until anything really runs (i.e. I am able to click on an app) takes up to 10 minutes with no applications opened yet.\nOpening up Illustrator works in 6 of 10 times, else it just freezes. If opened it does work okay though. Firefox freezes also on a regular basis. I never open up more then 3 applications at the same time, have no widget etc running and I got hundreds of gigabyte diskspace left.\nI get it, that this isn't the newest device but shouldn't the OS and some really simple task like opening up a browser be \"there\" in less then 5 minutes?\nMy question though is a different one: If I'd set up/reinstall the Mac completely new with Catalina (as I am bound by Creative Cloud to it) should that speed up my described routine or is the current scenario just what I can expect from the combination of that hardware/software combination?\n\nA: You can use Activity Monitor (in /Applications/Utilities) to see what processes are taking the most CPU and Memory, and monitor disk input and output. This may help to identify what is causing the slowness.\nHowever, the most likely cause (in the absence of any other info) is the presence of an internal mechanical hard drive, either by itself or as part of a 'Fusion' drive.\nMechanical hard drives are much slower than modern 'solid state' SSDs. If your Mac has to 'swap' memory data to and from the disk, then this will slow things down dramatically. Also, the drive is at the end of its useful lifespan, and may show signs of failing.\nWhile taking an iMac apart to replace the drive may be of moderate difficulty, you would do better to use an external SSD. Old Thunderbolt 2 enclosure are harder to find these days, but even a USB3 SSD will be faster.\nApple continued to install hard drives in iMacs for many years after it was using SSDs in its other Macs. So, in reply to the question 'is this normal for an iMac', the answer is sadly, yes.\n", "Q: Changing Screensaver on OSX High Sierra via Terminal I am trying to change screensavers on OSX machines.

And why is it accessing my Apple AirPort Base station using a long and obscure string? Scanning for Bonjour devices on my network shows a long and obscure string associated with my AirPort Base station using this Bonjour protocol _acp-sync._tcp. What is this? What is it for?\n\nA: Bonjour advertises the services on devices\nexample\nHOSTNAME._smb._tcp\n\nMeans the device is sharing folders via smb over TCP (as opposed to using UDP). It is also used with things like AirPrint to share printers.\nNow\n_acp-sync._tcp\n\nIts over tcp.\nIt would seem ACP is some sort of configuration protocol used by the monitoring and configuration utilities for the AirPort.\nSome people have tried to reverse engineer\nhttps://github.com/x56/airpyrt-tools\nI think natutil will tell you that its using TCP Port 5009\n\nApple AirPort Admin Utility, AirPort Express Assistant, Xwis (TCP/UDP) - Source SG\nairport-admin Apple AirPort WAP Administration (TCP) - Source NMAP\n\nSo yes its some sort of configuration protocol\n\nA: It is done so that the Airport base station, in its role as a NAT internet gateway, can advertise status information to devices on the local network. Status information includes things as whether or not an internet connection is available, the status of the LAN port on the base station, and possible information about active port mappings.\nIt used to be that you could use the command natutil on macOS to show that information in a human-readable form. However, I don't think it is included in Catalina and Big Sur.\n", "Q: A Better Way to Organize Project Files for Freelancers? Every year I work on many different projects, from design, to coding, to 3D design, to personal projects.\nMy usual model currently is to create folders for each project and after I am done with them file the folder in some kind of logical tree structure.\nBut, let's say I have a project that involves an ESP32 micro-controller and a specific customer. Sometimes I want to list all my projects that are related to ESP32, sometimes I want to list all the projects that relate to a specific projects, and sometimes I just want to list all the projects that I started in 2020, or any other given year.\nI know tags would work well for this task, but tags are not very portable, and once you have several dozen tags it becomes unwieldy. Are there any other organizing solutions out there?\nMy ideal solution would be to put a README.md file inside each project folder and have some kind of system that would allow me to search the contents of the README.md files, but instead of giving me a list of those files it would return a list of containing directories.\nBut, perhaps there is an even better solution that you could suggest. The goals are:\n\n*\n\n*Portable System that can be stored on ExFAT drive, if need be.\n\n*Ability to search for projects by different attributes or tags. It's fine if I have to go through all my past projects and tag them, but I would rather do that once :)\n\n*Some kind of tool with UI would be nice, but CLI is ok too.\n\nAny recommendations or maybe just a wholesale different approach to achieve the same result?\n\nA: Using my example of being able to sort the chapters of a book by language or by title, four ways I have done something like this:\n\n*\n\n*Two directories, language and title.  Language contains a directory for each language, other for each title.  Each of those contains symlinks to all the files of that category.  Don’t use hard links—when you edit one, you replace it with the changes and the other doesn’t change.\n\n*Each sort criteria is a different column in a relational database.  Other column(s) have all the other info needed.\n\n*An HTML page with a table having columns language, title, and file:// hyperlinks\n\n*Each file contains lines like “Language: Chinese” and “Title: “Trip to San Blas.”  Then, grep . -type f -exec grep -il “Language: Chinese” \\; will list the files in Chinese.\n\n\nA: The key challenge probably is to maintain all relevant data in a structured fashion for a longer time.\nYou could put the files into the most often used folder structure (probably per client/project) and use a spreadsheet to capture all the meta data and alternative structure information. Or, if this is too cumbersome, just use a standard naming convention for subfolders (e.g. always call the folder containing the corresponding code ESP32) and use the search functionality of the OS.\n", "Q: Erase Disk without Screen (iMac) I have an iMac running Sierra with one SSD and one HDD where the internal screen isn't working anymore. Using it with a secondary screen works just fine.\nNow I want to sell it and would like to wipe the SSD which contains the operating system. The problem I'm facing is that the recovery mode is only shown to the internal screen, on the secondary screen only the background is visible.\n\n*\n\n*I do have another mac (running Big Sur) but they do not share any connectors besides usb Type A so I cannot use Target Disk Mode.\n\n*I cannot close the computer because it is not a laptop.\n\n*I tried moving the window from the internal screen to the secondary screen but had no luck doing so. I'm not sure if the window is draggable.\n\n*I would rather not open the iMac to cut any cables.\n\nIs there any other way to wipe the disk?\n\nA: Yes. You create a Clone with Carbon Copy Cloner on external disk, you boot on this external disk and you can erase internal disk and install a clean version of Mac os x.\n", "Q: Is it possible to save a file from a macOS app directly to iPad Files? Beginning with Catalina, transferring files to / from an iPad is handled via the macOS Finder:  the iPad appears in Finder windows as a volume, and you can drag files from anywhere on your Mac to the \"Files\" tab of the iPad Finder window.\nCan other apps on macOS save to iOS files?\nSay for example I'm downloading a PDF on my desktop computer.  My browser prompts me for a Save location.  I would like to transfer the PDF to my iPad so that I can read it and annotate it using my preferred app on that device.  My current workflow is:\n\n*\n\n*Download file to Desktop (or Downloads folder, it doesn't matter)\n\n*Switch to Finder\n\n*In Finder, navigate to downloaded file's location\n\n*Drag file to iPad\n\n*Delete downloaded file (this step is optional, but I don't like to keep multiple copies of downloads cluttering up my workspace).\n\nIs there a way to cut out the middleman and just tell my Mac browser, when it prompts me for a save location, to save it to my iPad?\n(If it makes a difference, you can assume, for the sake of this question, that the iPad is connected to my Mac with a wired connection.)\nNote:  this is not the same as How can I download files directly from Safari to ”on my iPad”?, as that question appears to be about downloading files using Safari on the iPad, whereas I am using Safari on a Mac that has iPad connected in Catalina.\n\nA: The easiest way of sharing/accessing files between your macOS and iOS devices is to use iCloud Synchronisation. As far as I know, there is no way of accessing your iOS device as an attached storage device from within macOS Finder.\n\nA: Assuming your Mac and the iOS device are connected to the same network you can use simply an app like e.g. AirDisk Pro to mount the iPad As a network device on your Mac (there are quite a few of this kind of apps or ones who allow to setup a SMB Share on the iPad).\n", "Q: How (specificially) do I read a chat.db file? Like everyone else who uses Apple's Messages app, I have a chat.db file. I'd like to read the file but nothing seems to yeild the expected results.\nHere is what I've tried so far:\n\n*\n\n*The CLI approach of cd to ~/Libray/Messages followed by open chat.db was amongst the best in that something was found and there was an attempt to open the file. Unfortunately, it didn't work as hoped.\n\n\n\n*Since I now had the db browser for SQLite open, I tried to open the file via that app's gui but because the folder is hidden one, it didn't show.\n\nHas anyone had any success with this? I certainly can't be the first person to have tried and I've seen elsewhere the schema may also be an issue.\n\nA: The file you have found is a SQLite database and you need an application which can read SQLite databases.  You have many choices - search in the Mac App Store for SQLite (or similar) or use the Terminal command sqlite3.\nBut a SQLite database is intimidating to the first time user, even though it is amongst the simplest of relational databases. A \"relational database\" organises data into one or more tables (or \"relations\") of rows and columns. The power (and complexity) of relational databases comes with connecting data in two or more tables via relationships.\nTo make sense of a SQLite database, you need:\n\n*\n\n*An application - I use \"SQLPro for SQLite\" from the Apple App Store. Its web page is SQLitePro.\n\n*A query to extract the data you want. I have \"cheated\" and found one here SQL query for chat.\n\nSteps to read chat.db:\n\n*\n\n*Make a copy of the database - I copied mine to the Desktop.\n\n*Run your app and open the chat.db.\n\n*Choose the query tab.\n\n*Enter this query:\n\nCopy and paste\nselect\n m.rowid\n,coalesce(m.cache_roomnames, h.id) ThreadId\n,m.is_from_me IsFromMe\n,case when m.is_from_me = 1 then m.account\n else h.id end as FromPhoneNumber\n,case when m.is_from_me = 0 then m.account\n else coalesce(h2.id, h.id) end as ToPhoneNumber\n,m.service Service\n\n/*,datetime(m.date + 978307200, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as TextDate -- date stored as ticks since 2001-01-01 */\n,datetime((m.date / 1000000000) + 978307200, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as TextDate /* after iOS11 date needs to be / 1000000000 */\n\n,m.text MessageText\n\n,c.display_name RoomName\n\nfrom\nmessage as m\nleft join handle as h on m.handle_id = h.rowid\nleft join chat as c on m.cache_roomnames = c.room_name /* note: chat.room_name is not unique, this may cause one-to-many join */\nleft join chat_handle_join as ch on c.rowid = ch.chat_id\nleft join handle as h2 on ch.handle_id = h2.rowid\n\nwhere\n-- try to eliminate duplicates due to non-unique message.cache_roomnames/chat.room_name\n(h2.service is null or m.service = h2.service)\n\norder by m.date desc;\n\n\n\n*Execute the query.\n\nI can then see all my messages (I have squashed up some of the columns to partially hide my content):\n\nYou can use different applications - I have used dbHarbour (free, I think).\nOr you can do it in Terminal with a few incredibly detailed and finicky / unforgiving-of-even-a-single-typo commands:\ngilby@Beth/Users/gilby/Desktop% sqlite3 chat.db\nSQLite version 3.32.3 2020-06-18 14:16:19\nEnter \".help\" for usage hints.\nsqlite> .mode csv\nsqlite> .output chat.csv\nsqlite> select   <<<< Just copy and paste the query from above\n   ...>  m.rowid\n   ...> ,coalesce(m.cache_roomnames, h.id) ThreadId\n   ...> ,m.is_from_me IsFromMe\n   ...> ,case when m.is_from_me = 1 then m.account\n   ...>  else h.id end as FromPhoneNumber\n   ...> ,case when m.is_from_me = 0 then m.account\n   ...>  else coalesce(h2.id, h.id) end as ToPhoneNumber\n   ...> ,m.service Service\n   ...>\n   ...> /*,datetime(m.date + 978307200, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as TextDate -- date stored as ticks since 2001-01-01 */\n   ...> ,datetime((m.date / 1000000000) + 978307200, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as TextDate /* after iOS11 date needs to be / 1000000000 */\n   ...>\n   ...> ,m.text MessageText\n   ...>\n   ...> ,c.display_name RoomName\n   ...>\n   ...> from\n   ...> message as m\n   ...> left join handle as h on m.handle_id = h.rowid\n   ...> left join chat as c on m.cache_roomnames = c.room_name /* note: chat.room_name is not unique, this may cause one-to-many join */\n   ...> left join chat_handle_join as ch on c.rowid = ch.chat_id\n   ...> left join handle as h2 on ch.handle_id = h2.rowid\n   ...>\n   ...> where\n   ...> -- try to eliminate duplicates due to non-unique message.cache_roomnames/chat.room_name\n   ...> (h2.service is null or m.service = h2.service)\n   ...>\n   ...> order by m.date desc;      <<<< Press Return\nsqlite>\n\nThe mode and output commands make sure that the output goes to a CSV file which you can open in a spreadsheet.

I had successfully turned it off permanently in an earlier version of Big Sur by executing the following commands in the Terminal, followed by a restart:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\n\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\nHowever, upon upgrading to 11.4, the Notification Center reappeared spontaneously, and I could not turn it off again by executing the above commands. When I tried, the following error message appeared:\nUnload failed: 5: Input/output error\n\nIf I try\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\n\nit gives me\nUnload failed: 113: Could not find specified service\n\nAfter some experimentation, I found a makeshift solution. I had to go to Recovery Mode and turn off System Integrity Protection by executing the following command in the Terminal:\ncsrutil disable\n\nAfter a restart, the launchctl command above works and the Notification Center remains permanently disabled.\nBut! If I go back to Recovery Mode and enable System Integrity Protection again by executing the command\ncsrutil enable\n\nthen the Notification Center appears again in “normal” mode after a restart.\n\nQuestion: How big of a deal is it to leave System Integrity Protection disabled? Experts seem to agree it is a bad idea because it creates a security liability. But if leaving it turned off is the price I have to pay for getting rid of the Notification Center, I lean towards paying that price. At the same time, I wonder if there is a superior solution. Any thoughts/advice on this?\n\n\nA: Temporary Solution\nI've had the same issues. The only workaround I could come up with, is to minimise the area it took in my Menu Bar. The Notification Center icon is just a Digital clock and changing it to Analog in System Preferences > Dock & Menu Bar > Clock.\n\nA: I think (not absolutely sure) if you turn Notifications off with the method mentioned above, you do not get battery warnings anymore (on MacBooks, i.e. if battery drops below x%).

I'm using the 6th generation iPad, software version 14.5.1\nI have used the iPad's camera to take several photos. These photos appeared in the \"Photos\" app. Within this app I can create an album and move the taken photos into this album. So far, everything is fine.\nLater I ran out of space on this iPad, copied all photos from iPad to my Windows PC and deleted them from iPad.\nNow I want to copy some of the photos back to iPad.\nI use the \"Files\" app on iPad to connect to the shared folder on my PC and copy the files from PC to iPad. In the \"Files\" app I created a folder and put the images on iPad into the folder. So, the files are sitting on the iPad and the \"Files\" app can see them.\nNow I'm trying to move these images back into \"Photos\" app where they originally were and simply can't find a way to do it.\nIn the \"Photos\" app when I try to add photos to an album, the \"Photos\" app doesn't see the images that the \"Files\" app can see. In the \"Files\" app I can select all the images and tap \"Share\", but the \"Photos\" app doesn't appear in the list of apps with which I can share the images.\nHow to add images to the \"Photos\" app from the \"Files\" app?\n\nA: Actually you don’t have to copy them to the Files app but could select them on your PC in a shared folder you access from the iPad, select the Share menu and then „Save Image“.

I am used to Ubuntu and I am new to Mac. I'm using Macbook Pro 16\" 2019 with BigSur 11.2.3. What is the way to keep Firefox remember my opened tabs? I just quit Firefox with red dot on the left, then I run it again and it opens empty (without my tabs). Of course I configured Firefox to save session.\n\nA: The red dot is not Quit.\nThis is the first big thing you need to learn about Macs. The red dot closes the window, it does not quit the app. [Some single-pane apps will auto-quit on close - System Prefs etc, but this is not the rule for document-based apps].\nif you want any app to remember its last session - which all well-behaved apps do these days - then if you want to quit, use  Cmd ⌘   Q  [or Quit from the application menu].\nThis applies to within one session, or through reboot/shutdown/boot too. All Apple apps will return to the last-used state, even if there were unsaved documents.\nClosing a window, with the red dot or any other method, removes that window from the 'last session' information & breaks your workflow.\nSome browsers may have a 'get out of jail free' card. In the History menu will be a 'restore all windows from last session' or similar wording - don't rely on it, but sometimes that will pull back windows you had manually closed. There may also be a 'recently closed' item &/or 're-open last tab' which might let you step back tab by tab to get your closed pages back.\n", "Q: Why does Finder modify the date even if you've not changed anything in the folder? Using a MacBook Pro 2020, Big Sur 11.3.\nI've noticed recently when viewing folders via Finder that sometimes it modifies them to today's date.\nI did foolishly delete all .DS_Store files using this terminal command:\nsudo find / -name \".DS_Store\" -depth -exec rm {} \\;\n\nto try and fix beachballing in a corrupt account in Catalina, before upgrading, re-naming the old account and moving files across to a new admin account where they are now.\nI don't have beachballing in the new admin account anyway.\nWhat I've wondered is why some folders, which date back to Nov. 2020 or March 2021 immediately get a file modification date of \"Today at [TIME]\" even if I've just viewed them, not modified them?\nI had to change some via A Better Finder Attributes and it was a slow-ish process.\nLocking folders is probably a last step to prevent this, but I don't need to lock folders often.\nIn general, what's a good solution to ensure Finder has the same view settings across all folders and am I wrong in thinking it will change modification dates of files/folders that are occasionally accessed, even if their contents are not modified?\nAny help is welcomed.\n\nA: The Finder application creates and updates a .DS_Store file when accessing a directory. This file holds the custom attributes of its containing directory, such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image.\nThis is the reason you see some folders (directories) with a modification timestamp more current than any of the contents of the directory.\nTo disable this functionality for network shares, use the Terminal application and enter:\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true\n\nAfter this, reboot. No new .DS_Store will be created and you can remove the old ones.\nThere are no native solutions for handling local volumes. You might look to third-party solutions.\n", "Q: Help understanding Attempting to create AWDL interface for en0 in wifi logs Came across a wifi log today titled wifi-01-06-2021__(the date it was created). I have never seen one of this type before, and I am pretty confused about the first few lines of it:\nSC: <airport[237]> scInitInterface for device en0\n<airport[237]> _bsdDriver_init: registration for monitoring bssSteeringRequest event\nInfo: <airport[237]> psCallback: powerSource = AC Power\nInfo: <airport[237]> psCallback: set powersave disabled on en0 Roam: <airport[237]> _initInterface: AirPort Interface <en0> <6>\nP2P: <airport[237]> CreateVirtualInterface: Attempting to create AWDL interface for en0 with MAC address *omitted* (attemptNumber = 0)\nP2P: <airport[237]> CreateVirtualInterface: Created AWDL interface awdl0 with address *omitted* for en0\nOffload: <airport[237]> _openIpAddressMonitoringSockets: Monitoring IP address changes on en0\n<airport[237]> _initLocaleManager: Started locale manager\n<airport[237]> _initInterface: Failed to query current SSID (Operation not supported)\n<airport[237]> CoreCapture preference: 0\n<airport[237]> finished with CoreCapture preferences\n\nI know AWDL is the Apple Wireless Direct Link, and is used for peer-to-peer, and en0 is my wifi. What I don't understand is what it means by creating a virtual interface, or the MAC address that I have omitted.\nBluetooth and all sharing are disabled, and when this happened, wifi was disabled to. I wasn't connected to a network. The MAC address in question doesn't seem to match anything I can find on my Mac, or on my network, though that should be irrelevant given I wasn't connected to it.\nIs this just a random MAC address my Mac is generating using MAC randomisation, or what is it?\n\nA: Creating a virtual interface just means that the computer internally refers to something by one name which is really physically backed by something with a different name.\nFor example you might have a physical Ethernet interface in your computer, and then you create a virtual interface for a VPN connection. The data is really transferred over the physical interface, but you refer to the virtual name so that the system knows that the data destined there is going to be encrypted and encapsulated before being sent on the physical network.\nThe AWDL interface you have logged here could have been used for for example AirDrop, AirPlay or some form of Continuity. It is for example possible to AirDrop and AirPlay without being connected to an existing, specific WiFi network. Instead a direct connection is created using an Apple protocol over this “virtual interface”.\nRegarding the creation of the MAC address - this is not something you should worry about. It is perfectly normal for macOS to create randomized MAC addresses in order to prevent you from being unwillingly tracked by others.\nYou can read more about where and when Apple employs MAC randomisation here.\nYou can distinguish such a locally generated, randomised MAC because the 2nd least significant bit of the first byte is a one. This means that the MAC address is locally generated, and as such holds no intrinsic \"meaning\". If you look at the hexadecimal representation of a MAC address, this means that the second character of the address must be either 2, 6, A or E for an ordinary WiFi interface. An interface used for multicasting can have a 3, 7, B or F instead.\nThis is different from MACs that have the 2nd least significant bit of the first byte set to one. Those MAC addresses starts with a vendor ID that allows you to lookup whom manufactured the hardware. The second character of the hexadecimal representation of the address then is either 0, 4, 8 or C for a unicast MAC, and 1, 5, 9 or D for multicasting.\nYou did not include the actual MAC address you see on your system, as it was redacted from your logs - but you can check with the above mentioned system whether or not the MAC address you're seeing is actually a randomised, locally generated one or not.\nThe other part you were concerned about was not being able to find the interface in the list of interface you find with ifconfig. You can generate a full list of interfaces using this command:\nifconfig -l\n\nYou'll find the awdl0 interface in there. As indicated in your comments, you had a concern that this listing did not show the same MAC address as your log snippet. This is actually not a problem and completely normal.\nThe MAC address listed by ifconfig is typically the physical MAC. In practice it is often an address stored in an EEPROM chip on network interface during manufacturing. Note that the contents of an EEPROM can be changed, so it is still something that can be changed, if you would like.\nHowever, MAC address randomisation happens quite often (i.e. often when you connect to a new network SSID, every 24 hours or similar). For this purpose it doesn't make sense to change the \"burned in\" value in the EEPROM. Also your system can actually be using multiple randomised MAC addresses at the same time (for example if you're connecting to an infrastructure access point at the same time AirDrop'ping while AirPlay'ing).\nThe actual MAC address randomisation thus happens on a slightly different layer. It is so that when a packet goes out on the network, the operating system can typically with most types of interfaces completely decide which MAC address is listed in the header - it doesn't have to be the physical address.\nThis means that it is perfectly normal for ifconfig to show one MAC address while a different MAC address is actually using for packets going out on the awdl0 interface - and thus also for logging awdl0 related debug messages.\nIndeed if you look closer at the ifconfig interface list, you'll typically also find an interface named llw0. This is the low-latency WiFi interface - a virtual interface similar to the awdl0 interface. It will show the same MAC address as the awdl0 interface, as it the physical MAC of the WiFi interface that is shown. MAC address randomisation for awdl0 does not apply to llw0, so they can communicate with different MAC addresses at the same time.\n\nA: Apple AWDL is a proprietary undocumented IEEE 802.11 based ad hoc protocol. Apple uses it for Airdrop and AirPlay and perhaps even FindMy AirTag tracking (uses UWB radio not AWDL virtual interface). When you see the virtual AWDL0 interface that is what it is doing. Apple products are peer-to-peer talking to each other using this protocol.\nIf you are interested, there's a fascinating paper written by a few researchers who reverse engineered things in 2018 and documented their findings. I found that one of the co-authors of this paper posted the link to Stack Exchange previously.  https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03156\nVirtual interfaces typically change MAC / Physical Addresses when they are created. That's why the Physical Address (MAC) changes all the time.  I have an AWDL0 interface on my Mac that's not currently connected to anything but its there with a unique Physical Address (MAC).  Same thing happens with most VPN virtual interfaces. The Physical Address (MAC) is generated on the fly because the device is not actually a physical device. You can actually change your Physical Address (MAC) if you wish to. It's called MAC Address Spoofing.\nChange the address to aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff for en0 interface:\nsudo ifconfig en0 ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff\n\nSet a random physical address:\nopenssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//' | xargs sudo ifconfig en0 ether\n\nVirtual interfaces change Physical Addresses (MAC) all the time. They would do it via programming code and not so much a command line ifconfig entry.\nAddition: Not suggesting one should change their Physical Address (MAC) just that you can indeed change it.  Yes, Apple has been randomizing the Physical Address (MAC) as of late.  That was done for security reasons on iOS devices especially but also Macs. Apparently, Edward Snowden claimed the NSA was tracking movement of mobile devices via the MAC address. Other companies started randomizing their MAC Addresses as a result. Google has been doing it with Android since 6.0. Windows 10 and even Linux kernel 3.18 and above.\nChanging a Physical Address (MAC) can cause confusion as the first three bytes (6 characters) defines the manufacturer. This could potentially cause an employer's IT security to become concerned and block a device from the corporate network.\nSometimes a Physical Address (MAC) might be hardcoded to a particular system and changing it can break connectivity. But this is a small edge case scenario.\n", "Q: My iPhone 12's Personal Hotspot does not show up on my Macbook's wifi until I open the iPhone's settings. Why? My iPhone 12 Max's Personal Hotspot never shows up on the Macbook Pro M1's wifi list, even though it is always turned on. The only way to make it show up, allowing me to connect, is to open the iPhone's settings and click on the Personal Hotspot menu. Once I'm there, then it suddenly shows up on the Macbook Pro wifi list. That behavior happened with every iPhone I purchased on Brazil, but it didn't happen with the iPhone 11 I purchased on Japan.\nWhy is that happening? How can I force my iPhone to always broadcast its Personal Hotspot, even when I'm not on its settings screen?\n\nA: Because you have it turned on.  You have assumed manual control of the hotspot.\nIt will, however, not sit there beaconing all the time, because that would eat the battery.  It will beacon for a time, then stop.  When you enter the settings dialog, it begins beaconing again.\nSo.\nMake sure both devices are logged into the same AppleID, make sure Bluetooth is on so they can see each other, and turn the hotspot OFF.\nThe phone will appear in the menu and you can select it.  Note that the icon is different.  The Mac will ask the phone to enable the hotspot, and then connect to it.\n", "Q: New MacBook Pro M1 keep asking for admin password Keep asking, and does not accept password, though it is the right password\n\n\nA: Dude, I had the same problem. I typed the password, I swear, like 200 times. Then it worked. I think it's clearly a bug, but there is an end. You can see that is working because every time (or every 20 times :D) that you type the password, the build in the background is progressing.\nReally pretty annoying, but I tried every tricks that I know and this is the only way I made it work.\nEDIT:\nI fixed by changing the permission to the user private key in the keychain that Xcode was asking the permission (in my case the System Keychain)\n", "Q: Associate sh files on Mac with correct application I am new to macOS. I created an sh file but associated it with an editor in order to modify it. But now it opens with the editor and does not execute any more. Please advise how to associate sh files with correct application as before the change.\n\nA: To run shell scripts from Finder you need to\n\n*\n\n*make them executable with chmod +x SCRIPT\n\n*give them a .command suffix with mv SCRIPT SCRIPT.command\nTo keep them as .sh files\n\n*\n\n*select one of them in Finder\n\n*open the Info window (Cmd-I)\n\n*change the associated application to Terminal.app\n\n\nA: As an example, testing on a clean install of macOS Big Sur 11.4 (Intel) with no additional software installed and only the default installed software, a shell script made executable with a proper shebang, without an extension will by default be opened by and run in Terminal when double-clicked in Finder. One with a .sh extension will open by default in TextEdit.\nNote that without a proper shebang it may not execute properly by itself.\nA shell script with or without an extension can be associated with a different application, either individually or globally.\nIf you have associated your shell script with an application other then Terminal, or its default application and you want to associate it back to Terminal, or its default application, simply do it the same way you did it to begin with.\nTo change the association of a file in Finder, simple select the file and press ⌘I, then on its info sheet change its Open with: application setting.\n\nAdditional Information\nInstalls of some software, Apple and or a third-party application, can change the association of a shell script with a .sh extension to something other then TextEdit. For example, installing Xcode will associate shell scripts with an .sh extension to it, taking it away from TextEdit.\nA user can also change the default association at will.\nFor a global association change you can click the [Change All…] button, although do not do this if your are not sure of the action you are taking.\nAs a general rule, shell scripts should be run directly in Terminal and not from Finder. Opening for edit can be done easily in Terminal or Finder.\n", "Q: SSH and Screen Sharing Work on Remote OSX on Home Network but not SOCKS I asked a similar question on superuser, but haven't gotten any responses.\nI'd like to be able to surf the web with my home IP address while abroad.  I figured this would be easy to accomplish by allowing port forwarding on the home router to an old Mac laptop sitting at home (running OSX 10.9.5).\nAfter some fiddling with the Spectrum wifi router and allowing Remote Login and Screen Sharing under Sharing on the old Mac, I'm successfully able to ssh into the old laptop using the standard ssh user@remote and even screen share by setting up local port forwarding using ssh -f user@remote -L 15900:127.0.0.1:5900 sleep 60 then running the Screen Sharing app.\nHowever, I'm unable to get a SOCKS tunnel to work.

Is there a reliable way to correct the pronunciation of the say command without removing words or introducing pauses?\nMacOS's built-in say command mispronounces some words due to the pronunciation changing depending on context.  An endlessly problematic example of this is the pronunciation of lives, the plural of the noun life, and lives, the third-person singular conjugation of the verb live.  One answer to this question suggests using a table-driven approach to correcting mistakes, which is what I have been doing.\nLives/lives pronunciation confounds this solution because even if you substitute \"lighvs\" for \"lives\" to force a specific pronunciation, the say command will say \"livs\" anyway, sometimes and with some voices.  The underlying speech engine is apparently making a decision based on context, but the rules are opaque and non-obvious.\nExample: Using the \"Kate\" voice, lives is mispronounced.\n\n\"Deputies did everything they could tonight to de-escalate, and they almost lost their lives to a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old,\" said Volusia County sheriff Mike Chitwood.\n\nChanging it to\n\n\"Deputies did everything they could tonight to de-escalate, and they almost lost their lighvs to a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old,\" said Volusia County sheriff Mike Chitwood.\n\nproduces the same result.\nCuriously, if you remove the word \"almost\", leaving\n\n\"Deputies did everything they could tonight to de-escalate, and they lost their lives to a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old,\" said Volusia County sheriff Mike Chitwood.\n\nlives is pronounced as it should be.  Replacing \"lives\" with \",lighvs\" is also successful at forcing a particular pronunciation, but at the expense of introducing an unnatural pause.\nIs there a reliable way to correct the pronunciation of the say command without removing words or introducing pauses?\n\nA: This may not be the elegant solution that you are wanting, but the macOS Speech Manager has speech tuning capabilities built in. You can use them by adding inline modifiers to your text. For example, to spell a word phonetically within a string of text, you wrap the word inside an [[inpt PHON]]  [[inpt TEXT]] delimiter and use the table of phonemes (Table B-1 here) to spell what you want:\nsay \"they almost lost their [[inpt PHON]]lIHvz[[inpt TEXT]]\"  # SHORT 'i' sound\nsay \"they almost lost their [[inpt PHON]]lAYvz[[inpt TEXT]]\"  #  LONG 'i' sound\n\n(Note that capitalization matters in this table.)\nSo this lets you avoid removing words and introducing pauses, but at the expense of readability and manual intervention. That may or may not be enough to meet your needs.\nFull details are at https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/SpeechSynthesisProgrammingGuide/FineTuning/FineTuning.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004365-CH5-SW11.\n\nA: This is the closest I could get:\nUsing lyyves with Kate (long I): WAV audio sample | mirror\nUsing livvs with Kate (short I): WAV audio sample | mirror\nConfirmed working with voices Daniel, Fred, Alex, Samantha, Bruce, Zarvox too.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: How to create an offline hotspot to transfer data between iPhone and another device? I have a hardware accessory that (annoyingly) instead of supporting Bluetooth, requires a WiFi hotspot in order to communicate with an iPhone.\nUnfortunately I do not have tethering on my mobile data plan, and it seems foolish to pay for that feature when I don't need the internet aspect of it. When I tap \"Set Up Personal Hotspot\" the iPhone tries to send me to the webpage of my mobile provider. It does not allow creation of just a WiFi network without a data plan.\nIs there a setting or app for iOS that will allow me to create an offline hotspot that nearby devices can connect to? Again, this is only for transferring data between devices - I do not need an internet connection.\nOne more detail: I need to be able to specify the network name and password in order for the accessory to connect to it. These settings are pre-defined in the hardware.\n\nA: Unfortunately it is not possible to create such an \"offline hot spot\" with the iPhone. If your provider does not allow you to setup a personal hot spot, you cannot really get this particular product working like intended.\nI would say though that the way this particular product has been made to work is very unconventional. The user interaction with it hasn't really been thought through it seems. You are not the only one struggling getting that product working.\nOne work-around that some people seem to have found working is to install the Windows software for the product (for example in a virtual machine on a Mac, or an a PC). From there you should be able to change the WiFi network name (SSID) and password that it tries to connect to. Change them to your own WiFi network and from there on you should be able to connect with your iPhone as long as it is on the same WiFi network.\n", "Q: How to activate single-click to navigate to fullscreen application?

A message showed up that several directories in usr/local could not be deleted because of permission issues. So, I deleted all of them manually.\nAfter that I installed homebrew again, and the problem seems to have been solved.\n", "Q: How do I know what Xcode versions are supported in Homebrew for my specific macOS version? When trying to use brew on older macOS version 10.14 Mojave, I got the error message:\nError: Your Xcode (10.0) is too outdated.\nPlease update to Xcode 11.3.1 (or delete it).\nXcode can be updated from the App Store.\n\nHow do I know which Xcode versions are supported by brew on macOS 10.14? On any version? (Preferably, without installing Xcode and checking.)\n\nA: The runtime error message prints the maximum version for macOS 10.14:\n\nPlease update to Xcode 11.3.1\n\n\nI don't think brew documentation contain this information, but the source code contains the table in switch-case blocks, both for Xcode.app:\n  def latest_version(macos: MacOS.version)\n    case macos\n  ...\n    when \"10.14\" then \"11.3.1\"\n  ...\n\n  def minimum_version\n    case MacOS.version\n  ...\n    when \"10.14\" then \"10.2\"\n  ...\n\nso brew thinks any version from Xcode version 10.2 through 11.3.1 will work on macOS 10.14.\nThere's a seperate table for the Command Line Tools (CLT) which says the minimum Xcode version is 10.0.0.\n", "Q: Time Machine says it couldn't complete back up because disk is nearly full, but it isn't Time Machine says it cannot complete the backup because the disk is nearly full, but it is not.  In fact, the Time Machine tab under System Preferences says \"2.68 TB available\".\nTime Machine was working fine for a couple of years, then suddenly started getting this error.  I have not made any major file or fold moves recently.\nThe external backup drive is 4TB G-DRIVE which has always been used exclusively for Time Machine backups.  I noticed from the beginning that this single drive shows as two different mount points.  Under \"About This Mac / Storage\", it shows as:\nExternal 4 TB USB Disk\n\nG-DRIVE mobile USB-C\n2.86 TB available of 4TB\n\nG-UTILITIES\n4.04 GB available of 4.08 GB\n\nI assumed this was normal but perhaps it is not.  If it's not correct, I don't know how to correct it.\nG-UTILITIES just contains few instructional documents that came with the drive.  They are about 30 MB total in size.\nUnder \"About This Mac / Storage\", my hard drive that I back up (Macintosh HD), shows \"1.52 TB available of 2.12 TB\".  That is, it is about 71% full.\nWhat do I need to do get the backups running again?\n(I see other related posts on similar issues, but they are not quite the same.  Most of them refer to Time Machine becoming confused by large file or folder moves which is not relevant in this case.  And none of them address the 2 mount points for the single backup drive.)\nPlease see 4 screen shots below.\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n@Jean_JD Okay \"diskutil list\" output is below followed by Time Machine

(Apple, as opposed to Microsoft, is usually fairly careful to phrase their error messages precisely.) The error does not complain about the backup disk being full, but rather, about the disk to be backed up, i.e., Macintosh HD - Data⁩ being full. Looking at the log messages you posted shows why that is a problem: Apparently, TM tries to make a local snapshot first (presumably so that it can then make the backup without caring about changes to the live FS while backing up), but runs out of space while doing that: /System/Volumes/Data: No space left on device (error 28), Failed to create local snapshots, and Backup failed (50: BACKUP_FAILED_NO_SPACE_FOR_LOCAL_SNAPSHOT).\nThat's why it also tells you that you need to delete some files on this disk.\nYou can check with tmutil whether maybe you have a lot of existing local snapshots that you could thin out to make space, try tmutil listlocalsnapshots / and see if that lists previous snapshots or not. If it doesn't, I guess you'll really need to delete some stuff first (or at least move it elsewhere).\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I am happy to report this problem somehow cleared up by itself.  I did nothing.\n", "Q: Modify and save audio files with afplay I discovered the command line program afplay and it can turn a audio file up / down very quickly and I want this file to be saved afterwards.\nI don't know of any program like this that can change details so quickly.\nI've tried this, but it doesn't work. Any ideas?\nafplay audio.mp3 -v 2 > new_audio.mp3\n\n\nA: afplay options are for playback of the audio file and redirecting as you have in the command afplay audio.mp3 -v 2 > new_audio.mp3 just creates a zero length file because the output afplay goes to the sound system, not stdout for redirection.\nThe Audio File Play in the help output kind of says it all.\nIf you want to modify/create audio files, then you'll need to use program designed for that as afplay is designed for playback.\n% afplay -h\n\n    Audio File Play\n    Version: 2.0\n    Copyright 2003-2013, Apple Inc.

I have 2 late 2015 macbook pro, and one of them the speakers already have that distorted sound, like when a speaker is gone.\nThe other one is starting to have that same type of sound with certain youtube videos (only)\nCan it be that I am doing something wrong?\n\nA: Speakers in apple devices are tuned in such a way that the full volume is not the actual full volume of the component to the best if my knowledge.\nBut this was also discussed in mac rumors and one reply caught my eye and is quoted; “ As you’re probably aware, songs vary in recorded volume, which is why there are features such as Sound Check. Sometimes, a song can have a very high recorded or artificially increased base volume. When you increase the volume on these already loud(er) songs, the max volume your device tries to achieve may be beyond the speaker‘s capability. When this occurs — I’ll spare you the nerdy details — the sound will be distorted and the speaker sustains permanent damage, how much depends on how far and long the speaker is pushed beyond its limits. Eventually, if damage is compounded, the sound will be continuously distorted because certain components can no longer perform their function”\nSo maybe limiting volume to 90 percent can help the long way. Sometimes, it happens. My lightning earpods got damaged on left side but the 3.5mm earpods of 7 years is still perfect.\nAnd to the question, this is not your fault. If you had warranty, it could be replaced. Apple charges a hefty fee for replacement.\n", "Q: Concerns about the display of a 2015 MBP being up for a while I was attempting to update my 2015 MacBook Pro to macOS Big Sur 11.4 last night, but due to the low download speeds I have on my home router, I had to leave it up for about 12 hours (and it still didn't update). I'm wondering if that hurt the display (or the computer, for that matter) at all. It was plugged in and awake at auto-adjusting brightness for about 11.5-12 hours. Does this harm the Retina display (13in) in any way?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: No, this does not harm your Mac in any way.\nYour display will most likely outlast most other components of your MacBook. Something even more likely is that performance will drop so you decide to get a new machine within the next five years.\nOnly excessive use in very bad conditions (very humid, very hot,...) can shorten a Macs/computers lifetime drastically but usually your battery will be the first to be replaced, not your display.\n", "Q: Mac Software that Detects Windows Malware I want to use my Mac to scan drives that have Windows partitions on them for malware. I know that there are a lot of security software packages out there for Macs but I'm not sure if they detect Windows based malware to the same extent that a Windows security software package would. Does anyone out there have experience using their Macs to detect viruses on Windows partitions and/or external drives that may have been infected with Windows based malware? What software is the best for this?\n\nA: The antivirus tools I've used (Sophos and Malwarebytes) can scan for Windows viruses.\nOne issue that comes up is that typically macOS doesn't have write access to the bootcamp partition.\nFor external drives that macOS has write access to, the above tools had no problem identifying and quarantining suspected Windows malware.\n", "Q: What categories are selected by default in Spotlight Search Results? I am running MacOS Big Sur.\nI have modified the selected categories in System Preferences > Spotlight > Search Results some time ago.\nNow, I am wondering what the default selected categories are. There is no reset to default button. I could not find this information by googling so far.\nI am wondering if there is an online official document somewhere to specify what default categories are.\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: By default, all categories are enabled.\nVerified by installing macOS fresh into a VM, but it's been this way for as long as I can remember.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro M1 Video Output using DVI Adaptor On the MacBook Pro M1 screen the grayscale is achieved by partly turning on the pixels. I say this because under a magnifying glass there are no gaps between the pixels meaning that it is NOT a case of turning on alternate pixels.\nGiven that the video available from a USBC-to-DVI adaptor is digital, i.e. with no partly illuminated pixels (they are either full ON or full OFF) how will the DVI signals deliver this?\n\nA: DVI being a digital interface does not mean that pixels on the display have to be either fully on or fully off because of the digital \"zeroes and ones\".\nUsing DVI, a number of bits are transferred for each pixel to represent what we would like the display to show. The actual number of bits per pixels varies depending on your configuration - but it can be up to 48 bits in a dual-link DVI setup, but is typically 24 bits per pixels in many setups. It can also be fewer than that.\nIn a typical 24 bits per pixel setup, you would find that the intensity of the red, green and blue colors are described for each as a number from 0-254. I.e. 8 bit per color, 24 bits per pixel for a RGB setup.\nNote that the above is a simplified explanation of how DVI works on a conceptual level. The actual signal transferred over the wire actually uses 10 bits symbols to transfer 8 bit worth of payload data.\n", "Q: How to combine text items in a Siri Shortcut without skipping a joining character when a value is empty? \nI am creating a tab-delimited file from reminders.  Not every item in every reminder has a value, so I expected that some rows would have 2 tab characters next to one another, but instead, I'm seeing that different rows end up with different numbers of values because the cases where I should be ending up with 2 adjacent tab characters are reduced to 1 tab character.\nI suppose I could wrap each item in a conditional and insert \"null\" or something.  Is there a better way to do it to keep the shortcut as simple as possible?\nIncidentally, I'm doing this as a Siri Shortcut as opposed to AppleScript (which I also wrote) because the Reminders AppleScript dictionary doesn't handle subtasks or sublists, takes minutes to run, and requires the Reminders app be open on the current desktop (if I want it to finish in a reasonable timespan) whereas the Siri shortcut runs in the background in a few seconds and can process sub-tasks/lists.\n\nA: There is apparently no way to tell combine to not skip tab characters when a value in the text items being combined is an empty string, so you have to set up conditionals to check for empty values, and supply a default string value (e.g. null) to keep the number of tab characters in the output consistent.  You could then remove those values later with a regex on the combined text output, if you really want concurrent tab characters.\nAlternative Suggestion\nThat said, I ultimately decided to output in json format (instead of tab-delimited) and used a Dictionary step to set all of the \"column\" values.  I added that dictionary to a list.  After the reminder loop, I created a new outer dictionary and set a key where the reminder list of dictionaries was the value.\nJust note that if you have a list (e.g. of reminder titles), and that list happens to have 0 or 1 items, you end up with a similar problem.  Instead of missing tabs, your list in JSON is saved as a simple string, and you have to use a regular expression on the stringified JSON to fix the string value to make it a proper JSON list (so the json is consistent).\nE.g. The JSON should be this:\n{\"listA\": [], \"listB\": [\"single value\"], \"listC\": [\"value1\", \"value2\"]}\n\nBut unless you fix it, stringifying a dictionary with list values (e.g. listA (0 items), listB (1 item), and listC (2 items)) will produce:\n{\"listA\": \"\", \"listB\": \"single value\", \"listC\": [\"value1\", \"value2\"]}\n\nSo you have to do 2 regex replace steps to:\n\n*\n\n*Replace \"listA\":\"\" with \"listA\":[]\n\n*Replace \"listB\":\"([^\"]+)\" with \"listB\":[\"$1\"]\n", "Q: Run script every time the system's default gateway changes? I'd like to run a script every time my mac's default gateway changes. For example, I'd like it to run if my internet connection changes from Wi-Fi to ethernet, if it disconnects or reconnects, or if I connect or disconnect from a VPN.\nOn a more technical level, I'd like the script to run when an entry is added, removed, or modified in the system routing table for default or 0/1, and possibly a few other relevant entries. Something that runs any time the routing table changes would be acceptable too, since I could just detect if the change is something I care about.\nIs there any way to do this, other than just polling at some short interval and checking to see if the default gateway has changed?\n\nA: You can monitor files like the following for changes and act accordingly:\n\n*\n\n*/private/var/run/resolv.conf\n\n\n*/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist\n\n\n*/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\nYou can use a Launch Agent with a WatchPaths key, however, see the note regarding its use in the manual page for launchd.plist.  I will say that in spite of the note, I have not had issues with a WatchPaths key in my Launch Agents that I currently use. YMMV\nIf you are going to use Launch Agents and Launch Daemons, I highly recommend you read the manual pages for launchctl, launchd.plist and launchd.\nYou can read the manual page for command in Terminal by typing man command, then press enter, or for easier reading, just type command and then right-click on it and select: Open man Page\nOr use a third-party application like EventScripts.\nIt can trigger an AppleScript script or a shell script with events like:\n\n*\n\n*Internet became available\n\n*Internet became unavailable\n\n*External IP address changed\n\n*Wireless network changed\n\nAnd many more types  of events.\nHave a look at EventScripts, it's $5.99 at the US App Store, but a free demo is downloadable from the developers website.\n Note: I am not affiliated with the developer of EventScripts, just a satisfied user of the product.\n", "Q: Want to put Windows 10 or MacOS on a IMAC with corrupted HHD I had an old iMAC with a corrupted HHD, I tried every fix but nothing worked so now Im trying to install windows 10 on it.

Usually you can download macOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra) using another Mac from this Apple website. You can then create a flash drive installer using the instructions given on this Apple website. If this does not work, then other options can be found here.\nOfficially, your Mac supports 64 bit Windows 7 through Windows 8.1. The easiest way to install Windows 10 is first use the Boot Camp Assistant to first install Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, then upgrade to Windows 10. This requires Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 to exist on a DVD and that the Mac has a working optical drive.\nIf you try to install Windows manually, then note the following.\n\n*\n\n*The Boot Camp Assistant will install Windows to BIOS boot. You can try to UEFI boot Windows, but this may lead to driver problems.\n\n*The Windows Support Software for 64 bit installations of Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 for your model Mac can be found at Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621. You can also download this software by using the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n*Many answers have been post here at Ask Different for installing Windows on on Intel Macs.

Irregular number of characters before the \"_\" Please, I need help to incorporate an Applescript that allows me to remove all characters before the \"\" (including first \"\". The files have several \"_\", but I only want to remove the text before the first one. However, the number of characters varies from file to file.

I enabled iCloud Photos, and the upload looks to be complete, but the size of the library has not decreased.\nThis library initially appeared on my Mac when I imported photos from my phone using a lighting cable as a way to back them up. The iCloud sync doesn't seem to have created duplicates, so I think it was able to detect that these are the same photos, but it's still taking a lot of space on my drive.\nIs this expected? If not, what can I do to troubleshoot this?\nIn my preferences, Photos is set to \"Optimize Mac storage\".\n\n\nA: This is likely a combination of 2 things:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nRecent files … are always on your Mac.\n\n\n\n*\n\n… optimised versions of your photos are always on your Mac.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/guide/system-information/sysp4ee93ca4/mac\niCloud Photo Library always keeps low resolution thumbnails of your photos locally, and will also keep new, recently viewed or edited photos cached locally as space permits. The latter is purgeable by macOS when necessary, but only when necessary, so if you've turned on iCloud Photo Library from having all your photos locally, macOS doesn't go out of its way to clear that space unless it needs that space for something else.\n", "Q: No download button for redemption codes for custom app in Apple Business Manager I've managed to release my app through apple business manager but when generating redemption codes there is no download button showing so I'm unable to get my redemption codes.

I would like to get an idea of the sustained read and write speeds of a drive that I have connected to my Mac. As you may know, most drives do not consistently read and write at the same speed as it does initially—most SSD, NVMe, and even mechanical hard drives have fast a \"cache\" or \"buffer\" which is initially filled up, and then the actual storage of the device becomes the speed-limiting factor for data transfer.\nMany websites test the sustained write speed of drives (example) where a lot of data is written to the drive, for example 500GB or 1TB of data, and the speed of the drive is monitored during the writing process. A graph can then be plotted showing how the drive's speed changes when a large amount of data is written.\nThis is trivial on Windows and there is a lot of software that can achieve this. However, on macOS I haven't found anything similar. The most popular drive benchmarking tool, Blackmagic Disk Speed Test, reads and writes for short bursts. Although this gives an idea about the initial speed of a drive, it is a poor indicator of the actual performance of a drive.\nIs there a better software or perhaps terminal command to monitor the write speed of a drive while a large amount of data is written to it?\nThe only thing I can think of is monitoring the write speed of the drive using iStat Menus while transferring a large temporary file to the drive. However, there are some disadvantages to this way of doing it, as:\n\n*\n\n*This temporary file must be stored in a location that has a higher read speed than the write speed of the drive being tested. The internal NVMe storage of modern MacBooks should generally be fast enough, but is often limited (e.g. in a 256GB MacBook).\n\n*It is not readily possible to export speed data from iStat Menus to make custom graphs or for performing further analysis on the data\n\n*This just seems like a really rudimentary way of doing it. I would much prefer a software that records the write speed of the drive every second or so while the drive is being written to for a long period of time.\n\n\nA: Regarding software to assist you, I can (as a fan of Howard Oakley) suggest Stibium. Howard's recent interest is mostly with the often confusing disk speed of M1 Macs, but his insights (and software) apply in other situations. He has written numerous blog posts in past 6 months on this topic, for example measuring performance of M1 Mac internal storage.\n", "Q: Issues with dual-booting High Sierra and Big Sur? I'm currently dual-booting High Sierra (HS) and Catalina on a 2014 MacBook Pro without issues. HS is my primary OS; I use Catalina for programs that will no longer run on HS (e.g., Turbo Tax).\nI'm thinking of upgrading the Catalina partition to Big Sur (BS). The only issue I've found in my reading is that BS must be installed in a separate container (i.e., a separate partition) from HS, not merely a separate volume in the same container.*\nMy question is:  Are there any other issues of which I need to be aware?\n*According to this reddit post, installing BS in one volume of a container will cause changes to the container as a whole, and these changes are incompatible with HS. Thus, even though HS and BS both use APFS, they need to be in separate containers.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/jun2n2/beware_dont_install_big_sur_in_the_same_apfs/\nHere's a post from the Apple forums by a user who installed BS in the same container as HS, and lost access to his HS installation as a result:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/252049166\n\nA: I think, if there is no problem of disk space, it's better separate containers of different System in APFS structure.\nThe other thing to separate well is the data according to the systems used. Indeed, the compatibility of \"integrated Apple\" software is always upward but rarely downward. Thus if data used by \"High Sierra\" version software is used by the same \"Big Sur\" version software, there is little chance that the powerful \"High Sierra\" software will then have access to it.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to switch Split View positions in macOS While in Split View in macOS, clicking the top of a window and dragging it to the left or right will fluidly switch positions of the two windows. I use this feature a lot and can't find any online information about a keyboard shortcut to do this.\nCan anyone come up with an AppleScript script or solution for this without using a different window management app?\n\nA: AFAIK There is no native default keyboard shortcut to swap the position of windows in Split View.\nAFAIK There is no native default preference to set a keyboard shortcut to swap the position of windows in Split View.\nThat said, this answer presents an Automator Service/Quick Action method to swap the position of windows in Split View, which uses the third-party utility cliclick to perform the mouse click and drag events necessary to accomplish the task, while using the third-party utility displayplacer to provide Display resolutions along with which Display is the primary Display in multiple Display scenarios.\nThis currently works with:\n\n*\n\n*One or two Displays max.\n\n*Primary Display on left or right.\n\n*Split View on left, right, or both Displays, regardless of which is the primary Display.\n\n*Both Displays must be aligned at their top in: System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement\n\n*\n\n*An updated script to handle offset alignments may come at a future date. (Emphasis on may!)\nThe example shell script code, shown below, is used in an Automator Service/Quick Action with settings Workflow receives [no input] in [any application], using a Run Shell Script action with settings Shell: [/bin/zsh] and Pass input: [to stdin], using the example shell script code, then assigned a keyboard shortcut for the Automator Service/Quick Action in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nI set the keyboard shortcut for the Automator Service/Quick Action, name Swap Split View Windows, to: ⌥⌘/\nNote that assigning a global keyboard shortcut can be difficult to not step on a keyboard shortcut of whichever application has focus when the keyboard shortcut is pressed, and also may require adding that application to: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy or respond to a security related dialog box (more than once).\nIt may be better to use any of the third-party applications that can handle triggering scripts with a keyboard shortcut, then it is to use an Automator Service/Quick Action. I use applications FastScripts and Hammerspoon for many of my global keyboard shortcuts.\nOne reason I like using third-party applications to handle script execution and global keyboard shortcuts is that some of them intercept the keyboard shortcut before the application that has focus can receive it.

The text was too big for me.\nI was then able to access scaling options and opted for the option that looks like 1440p with the original resolution of 5k. This seems to give the best image and size for this external monitor.\nNow, I want to understand why the image is clear at what looks like 2560 x 1440 on my 4K monitor since the pixel distribution is not a modulus of 0. In my understanding, there is no way to distribute a 5k picture on a 4K monitor and yet get a clear picture. Since 5k is only 1.33 times bigger than 4k horizontally and vertically, how does it render? Is the picture quality worse than I think?\n\nA: What happens is that the system essentially renders the image offscreen at a much higher resolution where you haven't got \"a third of pixel\" and similar. Then that image is downsampled to the actual resolution of your monitor and displayed.\nThis process is ofcourse not \"lossless\" and will give a slightly worse image than if you had a monitor of a higher resolution where this problem does not occur. However, due to the relatively high resolutions we're working with today, it doesn't look as bad as you might think.\nIt is always a tradeoff of whether you prefer the perfect quality of having 4k and 1920x1080 match each other perfectly, or you rather have more screen real estate by opting for 4k and 1440p.\n\nA: When you choose 'looks like 2560x1440' and that is not an integer scale factor of 4K (3840x2160), macOS creates a virtual display twice the size (i.e. 5120x2880). All software (OS and applications) writes to that double size display.\nThe display driver then downsizes from the 5120x2880 virtual display to the 3840x2160 physical display. This ensures consistent optimisation which applies across all applications.\nAs you know, this creates a slight fuzziness but does mean that text looks the intended 'right' size.\nWhen choose 1920x1080 the scaling factor to 3840x2160 is exactly 2 so that the virtual display (twice 1920x1080) is the same size as the physical display.  As a consequence, no fuzziness, but everything looks far too large.\nMacs always look best (text size and crispness) with screens that have about 220 pixels per inch (ppi). Older screens were all about 110 ppi.  Anything else there is a compromise between best crispness and best text size.  It is not chance that the new 24\" (actually 23.5\") iMac has a 4.5K screen - 4480x2520 and 218ppi.\nMarc Edwards at Bjango has an excellent write up illustrating the compromises which must be accepted when a display is not about 220ppi.

One of the apps set to Disallow use of cellular data (Solitaire) uses the most cellular data of any app. This is despite the switch Always being set to Disallow use of cellular data.\nIs there another way to block a specific app from using cellular data?\nI don’t want to turn off cellular data altogether because my low budget provider doesn’t hold mms for redelivery(!).\nI have turned it on (moved switch to Allow use of cellular data), restarted phone, turned it off (moved switch to Disallow use), and restarted phone again. And restarted many times since. It still uses cellular data.\n[extra clarification notes]\niPhone 7,  ios 14.4.2,  WiFi Assist is always disabled.\nOn the Cellular page of Settings under the section heading Cellular Data is the list of apps that have attempted use of cellular data. For the user to allow or disallow use of cellular data on a per-app basis is a switch next to each app. I have set many apps to Disallow use of  cellular data, including Solitaire, which continues to use cellular data anyway.\nIt’s not alone, others like Backgammon and Paper.io also used cellular data despite being switched off. But Solitaire uses the most data, hence the focus on Solitaire.\n\n\nA: To answer your question about whether there is another way to prevent cellular data usage on a per-app basis: no.\nIf you disallow cellular data to be used by a particular app, then it cannot (or rather, I should say should not, in case there actually is a bug in iOS) access your cellular data. It's important to note that the number you see below the app (256 MB in your case) shows the total amount of cellular data consumed by the app to date, since the last time you reset your cellular data statistics. It seems as if you previously allowed Solitaire to use cellular data (and it has cumulatively consumed 256 MB of data), and only recently you have turned it off. Perhaps you are merely misinterpreting the number underneath the app?\nNow that you have turned off cellular data usage for Solitaire, do you notice the data consumption increase? If that's the case, then iOS has a serious bug. If not, then everything is working as it should be.\n", "Q: Making Gmail the default mail app made sharing via Email disappear from Photos app? I would like use the \"Share\" menu in Photos to share photos via email. This was by default bringing up the Mail app, but I don't use that and would prefer to have things simply open in Gmail in my browser (Chrome).\nI was able to configure GMail as my default mail reader by letting GMail set itself up as the default mail handler in Chrome, and then going to Apple Mail and configuring the \"Default email reader\" to \"Google Chrome\", like this:\n\nGreat! I thought I was all set.  Unfortunately, when I try to use the \"Share...\" menu in Apple Photos, \"Email\" is no longer an option. It has simply disappeared:\n\nIs there any way to get the \"Email...\" share option to show up when using Gmail (via Chrome) as my default mail reader?\n\nA: Correct.\nExtensions in the Share menu are provided by the application.  You set something other than Mail.app as the email client, so the Share target disappeared.\nI doubt the web browser is providing a Share extension.\n", "Q: upload file in chrome needs to open finder dialog twice to find all files Whenever I add a file to my new Mac (Big Sur) by for instance taking a screenshot, and go to upload it through chrome, the file isn't there when the upload dialog first comes up. if I close that dialog and click the upload button again as to bring up the upload dialog anew, the recently added file is there.\nSeems like the first dialog performs a search for new files, but those are only shown once the dialog is brought up again.\nPermission setting or what causes this odd behavior?

In fact if you click a bookmark/favorite, it navigates this window there.\nSee the difference?  In one case you are opening a document, in the other case you are navigating content.\nFinder like any file manager, is set up like a navigator, because that is how most people interact with folders/directories most of the time.\nThe \"Go...\" menu is like bookmarks/favorites.\n\nA: Holding the  Cmd ⌘  key while double-clicking on any folder, will open that folder in a new tab or window\n\nA: Just press CMD + N that should solve the problem\n", "Q: If I have 'allow apps to request to track' on, does the developer still get access to the data listed under app privacy? Under 'app privacy' the data that is listed such as location or identifiers which is under data used to track you, is that still available to the developer if l have allow 'apps to request to track' switched on and l decline?\n\nA: The data listed under \"App Privacy\" is a declaration from the developer to you as the user which types of data they used to track and, and which data they link to you. It is however not a technical or functional specification of features unlocked for you or the developer, and as such do not represent any kind of \"blocking\" or \"system denial\" of information made available to the developer.\nSo this means that for example if the developer has specified that they link \"Location\" to you, it doesn't say anything about whether or not iOS makes location information available to the app. You'll see a separate prompt asking letting you decide whether or not the app will get information from iOS about your location (mainly from the built-in GPS). You can change whether or not the app gets that information from System Settings.\nHowever even if you do not give that permission to the app, the app might still know your location by other means. I.e. for example by extracting location information from your photos, by deriving location information from your IP address, or many other means. The App Privacy declaration is there so that the developer is obligated to inform you whether or not they track you or link you by location by any means.\nNote that it is possible for developers to lie or give incorrect information in the App Privacy section. However, if they do, it would certainly give Apple the possibility to remove the app from the App Store if they so choose, and possibly, depending on your jurisdiction, you might have the grounds for a lawsuit.\n", "Q: Can two MacOSes share some users or home folders? I would like to create this partitioning on my mac.\n\n*\n\n*A partition A with MacOS version X.\n\n*A second partition B with MacOS version Y.\n\n*A third partition C with shared data.\n\nI would like to make partition C accessible from A and B.\nAnd ideally, since I also would like to share user configuration data and user data in general, I would like home folders to be in partition C.\nThis would mean that some users would be users of both MacOSes, or even if they are treated as different users, they would have the same home folders in partition C with similar permissions to read/write/execute files in those folders.\nA benefit of this would be to minimize the space used for user data by using a common space instead of duplicating much data which would be the same for both MacOSes.\nIs this possible technically?\n\nA: The problem is that different OS versions may define or parse 'user configuration data' in different ways. So keys in .plist files might use different names; the range of acceptable parameters for a key might vary.\nThere are also other data types, such as sqlite3 databases, which might similarly have different tables, different names, and different data.\nFor example, 'downgrading' the data for Mail.app to an older version may not be possible, or lead to data corruption.\nHowever, simply having a common area for documents is common practice -- as long as your OSes don't have different versions of applications that might use different data formats.\n", "Q: Can't turn on Bluetooth in my MacBook Pro I can't turn on Bluetooth on my MacBook Pro.

My phone and airpods charge from my laptop, does that affect the battery in anyway? and does it increase the cycle count?\nWill keeping it plugged in, help maintain the cycle count?\n\nA: The cycle count is an indication of how many times the battery has discharged from 100% to 0%.\nThis includes partial discharges, so using the battery from 100% to 50%, then letting it charge back up to 100%, and then discharging to 50% again counts as ONE cycle.\nIt is not a 'ticking clock of death', but merely indicative of how the battery has been used.\nIf your MBP is connected to mains power, then charging other devices through it will not affect the battery in any way.\n", "Q: Shortcuts stopped to work when Dvorak + macOS BigSur 11.4 I upgraded my macOS and after it the shortcuts stopped to work, on all apps!\nIt's like the Command + N is not respecting the current selected keyboard layout, it's using the QWERTY layout for the shortcuts.\nI have been using Dvorak layout more than 8 years, and it's the first time that this is happening.

My printer states in its specifications that it supports PostScript 3, PCL 5e/6, PDF, and TIFF. However, several other printers from that manufacturer do not state they support PDF. On the printers that support PDF, does Mac send the PDF file to the printer to be rasterised, and on the non-PDF supporting ones does Mac handle the rasterisation? I am specifically asking about Mac's default print window.\n\nA: Printers that explicitly support PDF can be sent a stream of PDF data, and the printer will raster it itself.\nPrinters that support PostScript will be sent a stream of PostScript data.\nPrinters that support PCL will be sent a stream of PCL data.\nThe job of printer drivers on your Mac is to tell the Mac which format to use (or in the case of non-native formats like PCL, to convert it).\nThe MacOS printing system \"CUPS\" contains programs called things like cgtops and cgtopdf, which convert CoreGraphics (the internal data structures of the graphical environment) to PS or PDF.\nOne benefit of the DTP revolution was the printer doing the rasterization from PostScript natively. Non-PS printers back in the day would require software RIPs, like Adobe's PressReady, to do the work, tying up the computer's CPU and producing huge files.\nCUPS currently uses PostScript as its default file format, but future versions are planned to use PDF.\n\nA: In usual Xerox fashion what exactly the driver does is lost in a morass of technical and legal mumbo jumbo on their website. (Sorry, long history with Xerox)\nBut the printer specifically supports Postscript printing. So we can assume that the driver sends Postscript to the printer (likely).\nNote that PDF is (basically) a read-only version of Postscript.\nUnless what you are printing is already a bitmap then macOS will send Postscript to the printer driver and the driver will likely send postscript to the printer.\nIn fact NeXTStep (on which macOS was based) used something called \"Display Postscript\" to draw the screen. MacOS' display output (EG everything you see on your Mac's screen) is put there via the direct ancestor of Display Postscript. So the entire display to print workflow is ALL Postscript (or a reasonable facsimile)\n", "Q: New user account for installing command line software I have two accounts on my computer - one is the admin and another is a standard \"user\" account.\nI want to install a few command line tools, one of which is Spleeter (https://ezstems.com/installing-spleeter-mac/), some of which I am unsure if they will install successfully or not.\nI'm wondering if the best way to do this would be to create another new user account so I can try installing them there?

For example, the Homebrew package manager places software under /usr/local.\n\n\n*Would deleting the 'test' account clean everything up?\n\nNot unless the software was installed under /Users/test.\n\nA: As the tool you want is installed via conda this makes some difference.\nFirst conda itself  sandboxes things to some extent (It alters the path for different environments) . Set up a new conda environment and then install Spleeter in that, unless you switch to that environment the tool will not be on your path and so can't be run (easily)\nIf you really want to be safe then you could set up a test user. All the things installed by conda will be in the test user's home directory. For testing and if you are worried this might be the best.\nFor things not installed via conda e.g. by a standard Unix ./configure;make install see the other answer but better use a package manager e.g. Macports, Homebrew etc. where someone else will have worked out how to install the tool.\nFor both cases if you are really worried then install macOS in a Virtual Machine and then install into that\n", "Q: In the Find My App - why does Macbook show a random time in the middle of the night?

A relatively large number of my Mac applications causes the MacOS Firewall to ask whether to allow or block \"Incoming connections\" (System Preferences > Firewall > Firewall Options).\nExamples: Dropbox, Google Chrome, Apple Music, Spotify, Steam, Apple TV app, etc. Plus a number of less widely known applications that I use frequently.\nWhat is best practice with regards to allowing or blocking incoming MacOS Firewall connections? Is there any rationale that should be employed in general when confronted with this question?\nI assume that it may break some functionalities if I block. For example, perhaps Dropbox won't work. However, I tried blocking incoming connections for Google Chrome, and I haven't had apparent issues.\n\nA: Rational for any security software follows from taking a risk management approach - identify risks to your computer and then what mitigation measures are appropriate/required. Nevertheless it can be interesting to explore capabilities of firewalls, anti-malware, etc.\nRegarding the macOS firewall, do you have significant risks which it can address and preferably without inhibiting your computer use?  You presumably want your apps to work as intended, and don't want any firewall to inhibit them, though very few apps accept incoming connections.\nAnd, if your Mac is connected to your home LAN, then you already have a firewall in your home router which is most likely quite sufficient for protection against outside attacks.\nThe case for turning on a firewall is if your Mac is used in insecure networks - for example, hotel Wifi.  But to address threats in that situation it is arguably better to make sure that the Mac connects via a VPN service.\nSo I am making the case that 'normal' practice is not to enable the incoming network firewall included in macOS. 'Best' practice is dependent on situation and risk profile.\nRegarding firewalls, if one is required you are much better looking for one that a) controls both outgoing and incoming connections, and b) has distinct profiles for different network connections (home LAN, work LAN, public wifi, etc.).\nSo I get to 'best' product which is to use more advanced firewall software.  In my case I use Little snitch which fulfils the two requirements in the last paragraph. But in addition it has 1) a more advanced graphical interface for firewall rules, 2) comprehensive application based network monitor, and 3) some knowledge of applications, developer signatures, and so on.\nAt present I use Little Snitch in monitoring mode - that is without any active blocks. Whilst it is very capable as an incoming firewall, Little Snitch is most often used to block outgoing connections where the user feels that an application is making more outgoing connections then are really necessary (Adobe might be considered guilty) or don't make clear what content is being sent via outgoing connections.\nNote, I am a user of LS, and have no other connection with the vendor.\n\nA: Best practices require a working knowledge of networking. Basically, you want to block all incoming connections except for those services and companies you trust.  The default App firewall on macOS does that quite well. Under the Firewall Options button you will see a checkbox to Automatically allow built-in software to receive incoming connections.  That covers the stuff Apple uses and what is included with macOS.  Another checkbox for Automatically allow downloaded signed software to receive incoming connections.  That one would cover 3rd party Apps from the App Store or those installed that have been notarized.  The last option is for enabling stealth mode which means there will be no response whatsoever when  someone tries to make an external connection that isn't allowed.\nBut the built-in macOS App firewall does not alert you on outgoing connections.  3rd party firewalls such as Little Snitch let you know about outgoing as well as incoming connections. It's one way to quickly know that something suspicious is going on.  Let's say you have malware on your Mac and it's trying to phone home to a command and control server in the Ukraine.  Well Little Snitch will tell you something is trying to make a connection to a particular IP address and network port and ask if you want to allow it. This is where you need to stop and go think about what's happening.  You might need to determine where that IP address is located. You might want to go take a look at the executable that's making the connection. Many companies are now collecting metrics data about how you use their application and most anonymize this data collection to protect your privacy. But many are not and they are doing a lot more than collecting telemetrics. Being able to block outgoing connections is something one might consider doing. But even with Little Snitch you are going to need to learn a great deal to understand what you are looking at when it does alert you. Little Snitch is commercial software. There are some free tools that will alert you on outgoing connections.  Read up on the Objective-See website all of those tools are free.  Again, still requires a working knowledge of networking to understand what a particular alert means.\nApple provides a much more sophisticated firewall called the packet filter firewall and it comes from BSD UNIX (albeit modified by Apple) and it can block incoming and outgoing traffic with far more sophisticated rules than what you see with the default App firewall you are using now.  Unfortunately, it's very complex and unfriendly to configure and requires a wealth of networking knowledge.  It would also require a lot of testing to ensure you do not block something by mistake.  The built-in App firewall will override things so it doesn't break stuff but not so with the PF firewall.  You tell it to block something and it's going to block it without question.  You aren't going to see any alerts either.  In order to monitor the firewall you would have to capture the logs and send them to a centralized logging service to maintain log history for advanced queries, etc. Or write some scripts to store the logs in a database locally.   Corporate, Government, and Educational institutions would use the PF firewall managing it across every Mac in their fleet. They have expert security staffers to configure the PF firewall and maintain it. Plus additional tools to help protect the network and devices.\nIf you are at home behind a router, you have some basic firewall protection due to the the NAT in the router.  But when you are on public WiFi there are others on the WiFi that might try to attack your Mac or intercept your network traffic. That is why VPN is handy as it encrypts the traffic. But VPN isn't a bullet proof solution as marketed by all those VPN companies online.  You can still get hacked even if you use a VPN. One of the worst things you can do is to pirate commercial software. Many times those pirate versions include malicious payloads that come along for the ride. You authorize the installation of that software and you get a piece of malware installed along with it.  That malware will likely phone home to command and control servers receiving updates and new instructions and the hackers can remotely own your Mac. Able to do just about anything. One of the worst things would be encrypting your files and demanding ransom via some digital currency payment. Or they might use your computer to send SPAM or spread the malware. Or use your compute power to generate digital currency.\nYou are already performing best practices by using the macOS built-in App firewall.  Now you should learn a bit more about how TCP/IP networking works including network ports and UDP traffic and how to determine where an IP address originates and how to lookup what a particular network port is typically used for, etc.  There are literal careers based on security best practices and you can spend a lifetime refining those best practices.  There's a heck of a lot to learn if you are interested.\n", "Q: Macbook shutting down after a screen glitch My 13\" MacBook Pro (Late 2017) with MacOS 11.4 started to behave weirdly today:\n\nAfter a few seconds, it goes black, just like it was turned off – but it is not. I have to turn it off by long-pressing the power button, and then I can bring him back to life.\nI was having another screen plugged in the first time it happened and the glitch appeared first on the screen, and then after ~5 seconds on my MacBook' screen.\nWhat might be the reason for such behavior?\n\nA: Honestly the first thing I would have advised is to plug in an external monitor. Whoops you already have done that.\nSo if that happens on both internal and external displays it is not the display itself. Instead I would tend to blame the GPU (graphics hardware subsystem). Especially as the system doesn't shut down, rather it has to be manually shut down.\nThat said it might be worth your while to back up your system, wipe the drive and reinstall macOS. If the problem does not return well I was wrong and it was something in macOS causing this.\nBut honestly too many years doing computer support for a living it smells like a hardware issue. So it may require repairs at your local Apple repair shop.\n", "Q: Are there credible technical bases for reports of “Apple deliberately slows down older devices when new software is released”? Today while I was choosing an iPhone to buy, a clerk said that choosing iphone 7 would be unwise, as it's old and in few years it will stop receiving updates.\nAt first I thought \"so what, device's battery lifetime degradation and stuff should start from the moment it was assembled, not from the moment this model became available for sale, right?\", though then I remembered this article and began to seriously worry: what if through this last update backdoor I'll receive same batterygate that will be gradually worsening phone's performance to force me to buy a newer model and that's why this clerk bothered to warn me.\nSource of the chart: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=Slow%20iPhone\n\nAs a consumer I want to research buying Apple devices without worrying that their performance will intentionally get worsened after an update for marketing reasons.\nCan someone with experience of verifiable references weigh in on either side of this dilemma?\n\nA: To address your assertions :\n\na clerk said that choosing iphone 7 would be unwise, as it's old and\nin few years it will stop receiving updates\n\nThat is a correct assertion from a software perspective. Apple dropped support for iPhone 6 (2014) in 2019 when launching iOS 13. iPhone 6s (2015) seems to still be supported in 2021 for iOS 15 (but that's a surprise).\nThere is no guarantee that the iPhone 7 (2016) will support iOS 16, even less iOS 17. You can't expect to buy a 5 year old smartphone and keep software support for 5 more years.\nNote that when I talk about software support, I'm talking about the latest version with up-to-date features. There is an history of Apple releasing security fixes for older iOS versions, but again, there's no guarantee on this.\n\ndevice's battery lifetime degradation and stuff should start from the moment it was assembled\n\nThat is correct, battery degradation starts at the time it is manufactured. But note that the iPhone 7 is no longer manufactured, it has been discontinued in 2019. Even if you can find a brand new iPhone 7 now, it must have been sitting on the shelf for at least 2 years so the battery is definitely not in a brand new state.\nThose two aspects are very good reasons not to buy an iPhone 7 in 2021 if looking for a brand new phone and would certainly explain the clerk position. If however you can get a very good bargain and don't mind the software support, you can definitely buy one now, they are still fully functional smartphones.\nAnd to address your final question :\n\nAre there credible technical basis for reports of “Apple deliberately\nslows down older devices when new software is released”?\n\nThere is two aspects of this, the first is software, the second is hardware.\nFor the software aspect, all update includes a new set of features with increasing computational complexity. Those are designed to take advantage of new hardware but may not operate as smoothly on older hardware. That is true for iOS but also for any other operating system (Android, Windows, etc.).\nThe longer you keep software support for older hardware, the higher you risk slowing down those older devices at each software update. Apple has an history of keeping support for older devices (often longer than other mobile OS) which can have a consequence of slowing down older devices, wether it is deliberate or not is a matter of opinion.\nFor the hardware aspect, when a battery gets older, it not only loses its capacity and drain more rapidly, it also loses its ability to sustain high current. If a battery is worn out enough, it may not be able to provide the power required by the smartphone on heavy tasks.  This phenomenon may lead to random shutdown if no other countermeasure is implemented.\nThe measure implemented by apple was to limit the CPU power on older devices to avoid these random shutdown. This have the consequence to slow down the phone. This raised some backlashes and can now be turned off (if performance is preferable to system stability).\n\nA: Each generation of iPhone is much faster than the previous generation.  App developers often write apps for the newest generation and then discover that their code runs more slowly on older hardware.  Usually they will then go back and do some optimizations to make the performance reasonable on older hardware.  But this takes time and there are limits to how many old iPhone versions they can support.\nIf it were possible to load up a new iPhone 5 with apps from 2012, the performance would be great (although some of the apps would be unable to work with their current services).   But the 2021 versions of these apps are optimized for newer phones first and will be much slower on the iPhone 5, if they run at all.\nApple doesn’t have to do anything to make old phones slower.  The individual app developers just decide it’s not worth it to support old phones anymore.\n\nA: Apple uniquely controls and shapes the experience of iOS. If you do not trust Apple, do not buy an iPhone.\nConsidering the impact of Apple's past behaviour, Apple settles iPhone slowdown case for up to 500M USD and a 25M EUR fine by France's DGCCRF for slowing down old iPhones, it would seem foolish to attempt the same approach twice. It appears Apple will now inform you before slowing down your device.\n\nA: It's true that Apple added code to iOS update 10.2.1 in January 2017 so that if your battery had degraded sufficiently, it would run slower, to avoid sudden shut-offs if the power rose too high for the battery to cope.\nBut that's a world away from deliberately making all older phones run slower with the express intention of making you upgrade, and there is no evidence to suggest that.\nI have an original iPhone SE (c. 2016-2017). I had the battery replaced in 2019, because it was shutting down and showing erratic % reporting (on iOS 12). Since then, it runs very well on the latest version of iOS (14.6), with no signs of any slow-down.\nAlso, I would suggest that 'people searching Google for the term iphone slow' and 'people having problems with slow iphone' are not the same thing.\nOS updates download onto the phone in the background, and may use up all the remaining space, if there's not much left, and this by itself would cause sluggishness, before the update was installed.\n\nA: I just wanted to add a different angle to this:\nThe clerk warned you that the iPhone 7 is becoming an older model (released in 2016), and that you should take that into account when choosing what to buy. You then make this a question about batteries.\nIf I were to buy a new phone now, I wouldn't really be concerned about the battery on an older design. Battery technology doesn't change that much from iPhone generation to iPhone generation - development is quite slow. An older design phone could (and probably will have) a quite new battery - it's not like a new iPhone 7 bought today comes from a stockpile manufactured back in 2016.\nI would however be very much concerned about software updates, which is what I think your clerk was concerned about as well. Not in the sense that a software update could come along killing battery life - I don't see that as likely. The real issue is no updates at all!\nAn iPhone usually lives in a connected world. If you want to be secure, and who doesn't, you really need software updates. An unsupported phone would quickly turn into something that is no longer as secure as a more recent model. That is all down to software updates.\nThis quite important and needs to be factored in when comparing a cheaper iPhone 7 to a more expensive iPhone 8 or iPhone X.\n\nA: I should turn my comments into a proper answer, though without citations…\nThe question itself conflates information, leading to a contentious conclusion, then asks for credible information to refute it. As asked it cannot be refuted, as it is based on a false premise.\n\n*\n\n*Battery life clock is ticking from the moment the battery was made.\n\n\n*Most people tend to assume/claim/complain any new OS is slower than the last. As new OS & new phones come out at the same time this is an easy conflation of conclusions.\n\n\n*The last time they did slow phones down to prevent sudden crashes as the battery gets older/weaker, the uproar made them reverse their decision. You can now make your phone crash rather than slow down. [They did perhaps get their own back in this respect - once you toggle it to crash instead of slowing down, you cannot toggle it back without completely erasing & setting up as a new device.]\n\n\n*Though we won't know until Apple makes the announcement officially, the iPhone 6S & 7 are the most likely to go unsupported at the next iOS update. The absolute worst time ever to buy an Apple device of any sort is today… the day of the WWDC. Whilst guesses have been made as to what they will announce, no-one will know for sure for another 4 hours.\nAs regards disabling updates, you can refuse any or all offers to update for as long as you like. You cannot, however, pick & choose. You either update to the current newest OS or not at all. It's not like Windows with weekly partial updates, each with its own raison d'être in a series of confusing Knowledge Base articles, it's all or nothing.\n", "Q: is there a pdf viewer that doesn't take over the screen in presenter mode?

Back in the halcyon days of OS X 10.4 through 10.10, I used to have a USB stick that had several partitions each with a different version of OS X.  I could plug in the USB stick and option-boot, and up would come a menu letting me boot into any one of them.\nNow, however, I see that OS X editions such as 10.14, 10.15 and 11.0 create recovery partitions as a mandatory and separate partition on the drive (that takes relatively little space).\nDoes this mean I am limited to one OS X installation per USB stick?\n\nA: The OS X installer deals with the recovery partition by partitioning the partition is given (from my understanding). If you only give it a 250 GB partition in a 500 GB disk, it will only use 248 GB (or something like that) for MacOS and 2 GB for recovery. Though I have not personally tried this, many articles explain that partitioning the disk into two APFS disks (this is NOT the same as creating an APFS volume that shares space in a container), which is similar to creating another partition dedicated to storing only files. Then, use the older/newer macos installer to install to the other partition (click show all disks when it asks to install on main partition). After installing, use startup disk picker or hold down option during bootup to boot on the older/newer version.\n\nA: I handle all OS X/macOS installers from Lion to Monterey on a single USB key , partitioned with eleven JHFS+ disks.\nInstallers needing to do their \"own business\" do it in a safe way within their own small created disk.\nI never got any problem.\nThe trick is to give enough space to each of them according to the size of the installer, plus a little additional free space.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get high bandwidth screen sharing between Macs connected via ethernet? I was using my MacBook Pro (Mac 1) to control another Mac (Mac 2) using the \"Remote Management\" feature in System Preferences > Sharing. This allowed me to control Mac 2 from Mac 1 if I was on the same WiFi network on both Macs.\nI noticed that screen sharing was quite laggy with some latency. Furthermore, file transfers did not exceed 4-5 MB/s. I presumed this was due to poor WiFi connectivity. During screen sharing the upload speed on Mac 2 never exceeded 3 MB/s, confirming this.\nI decided to connect the Macs using an Ethernet cable, hoping that this would improve file transfer and screens sharing capability. The file transfer rate increased to 100-110 MB/s. However, screen sharing seems to be just as bad as before with upload speeds not increasing beyond 3-4 MB/s, suggesting it was still using WiFi to screen share. I was able to confirm this by turning off WiFi on Mac 2, which dropped the screen sharing connection (but still kept the filesystem connected and allowed me to transfer files via the ethernet cable).\nIs there any way to force the Macs to use my high bandwidth ethernet connection for remote management/screen sharing? This would allow me to benefit from lower latency and higher frame rate when controlling Mac 2.\nI have tried all of the solutions from this answer, but nothing has worked.\n\nA: You will need to use a third party product that does not use VNC protocol - most likely a proprietary protocol. It is unlikely you will be satisfied with any free product.\nI use Jump Desktop which has both client software ($$$) for your Mac1 and server software (free) for your Mac 2. Using Jump's 'Fluid' protocol, I find the lag minimal using my MacBook (wifi client) and my iMac (ethernet server) on my home LAN.\nJump is acceptable over the Internet too, but don't expect miracles.\nThere are other products - Jump is my favourite.\n\nA: I found VNC is laggy compared to other solutions. It is kind of OK using realVNCs free viewer (you can buy their server too for even faster performance).

After deleting APFS container disk8, I get this:\n\nThe space that the deleted APFS container disk 8 used up is lost and not reclaimed by APFS container disk 7.\nI tried  diskutil apfs resizecontainer disk5s1 0, but no result. I can only use 4.3 TB of my 8 TB disk.\nHow can I make container disk 7 use all 8 TB?\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk5\n\n\nA: Thanks for the answers.\nAfter several days of unsuccessful searching for a solution that allows to free up the unused space on the Disk and make it available for storage I gave up and:\nI cloned all Data from the disk to another disk. Then I reformated the whole disk and copied the data back to its original disk. It took about 3-4 days of nonstop Carbon Copy Cloner. This is the year 2021. This is MacOS Big Sur by Apple. What a disaster. What a piece of Cr*p.\n", "Q: Can MacOs Apple ID and iMessage app Apple ID be different? If my Mac is not signed in to iCloud and I sign in to iMessage (left), does that only sign in to iMessage, or does it also set the Apple ID for MacOs and sign the whole machine into iCloud (right)?\nSimilarly can the two Apple IDs shown below be different?\n\nIf the answer is version-specific, my MacOs version is 10.15.7.\n\nA: Yes they can be different, I've run a Mac like this since iMessage came to macOS without issue.\nSign into the Messages app to just use Messages with that Apple ID (and sign into FaceTime if you want to use that ID with FaceTime too), then sign into the Apple ID preference pane in System Preferences.\n", "Q: Getting “Bye Bye Big Sur” error on installing Big Sur My current macOS version is 10.14.6 (18G103). I have downloaded Big Sur from App Store but when I am trying to install, I am getting error \"Bye Bye Big Sur\" when I click on installer.\n\n\nA: That is not a macOS prompt. The icon is from Jamf, a mobile device management solution used by organisations to control devices. Your IT department has most likely blocked Big Sur. They control the dialog and text content. Contact your company or device administrator.\n", "Q: TouchID not filling passwords on Safari and just showing passwords stored inside Safari, not Keychain I am using BigSur for the first time today, after unboxing a new iMac M1.\nI migrated all my stuff from an old iMac with Catalina, to this one, using a time machine backup.\nThe new machine is working well but everything related to passwords is a mess.\nI have been using macOS for 15 years. I have billions of passwords for websites on keychain.\nNow, on this new machine, when I visit a site that requires username/password, the field username appears filled but when I click on the password field, I am offered the option to unlock the passwords using touchID. This feature fails 100% of the time. If instead of using TouchID I type my mac password I see only the passwords stored inside safari, not those on Keychain. But the keychain passwords are there.\nAny way to make this work as before?\n\nA: Having done this only last week - it is supposed to work. It does here.\nHaving also had multiple issues with Time Machine recently, I could make one suggestion - but it will take several hours… Set the Mac up again from scratch & at the point it asks about Migration, migrate directly from the other Mac, 'live' across ethernet, rather than from Time Machine. I've had several occasions recently where that fixed general 'weirdness'.\nAt Migrate, you go to the old Mac & run Migration Assistant [in Utilities]. The new Mac will then see it & start to set up from there, similar to from Time Machine. You will essentially be locked out of both Macs until it is complete.\nNote that Recovery procedures are different on an M1 Mac, so print this page [or access it from your phone] before you start, just in case. - https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl82829c17/mac\n\nA: Thanks for @Tetsujin but I have chosen to opt for the brute force method and reinstalled BigSur on a two days old machine and all the problems were solved.\nIt is a shame how a brand new machine already comes with a lot of little glitches.\n", "Q: Keynote, Pages and Numbers all quit unexpectedly Today Keynote, Pages and Numbers all quit unexpectedly right after being launched.

The most obvious difference between an Apple Pencil (1st generation) and a Apple Pencil (2nd generation) is that the latter pairs and charges via the Smart Connector on the side of an iPad, whereas the 1st generation has a removeable cap covering a Lightning connector.\nThe iPad (7th generation) has the same Smart Connector as the iPad Pro, but still can't use the Pencil 2.  Presumably there are other hardware limitations that prevent this.  What exactly are they?  Is there some hardware limitation, or some other reason (other than \"Apple doesn't want to support it\") why it can't be supported?\n\nA: Source:\n1. Cost savings\nThe Apple Pencil 2 gets power through an inductive charger built into the side of the 2018 iPad Pro models. This charger is too expensive to include in the new iPad Air 3 and iPad mini 5, according to an unconfirmed report from Daring Fireball.\n2. Design considerations\nThere are other reasons these new tablets support the original Apple Pencil rather than the newer iteration. That inductive charger requires the edge of the tablet to be flat, while the new iPad Air and mini have rounded edges. Building in support for the Pencil 2 would have required both to be redesigned but Apple clearly decided not to, likely as a way to cut costs.\n3. Pro vs. non-pro\nThe two newly-announced models aren’t the only iOS tablets that support the original Apple Pencil. The 9.7-inch iPad introduced a year ago does as well. That means that all of the current non-professional iPads can use this stylus, while all this company’s Pro tablets use the Pencil 2.\n\nA: The technical specifications for the iPad 7th gen are fairly clear it doesn’t support the inductive charging required to pair the 2nd gen pencil.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/SP807\nDo you have a tear down that shows it mirrors the iPad Pro hardware setup?

Does Reminders and Contacts still sync even if I used up all my iCloud? If yes, what if I add photos to my 100's of task in reminders, will it still sync?\n\nA: When you use up your available iCloud storage, no new items can be added.  Existing content will continue to sync as long as they do not increase in size and cause you to exceed your allocated storage (this will change slightly in iOS 15).\nYour options are to either buy more storage or delete items that you no longer use or need.

It all works great.\nThe way to allow the Mac to boot is as follows(this is done inside the command line when booting from the Windows installer USB):\n\nTo make your installation bootable, enter bcdboot W:\\Windows /l en-us /s Z: /f UEFI. This will create the boot files in your EFI partition.\n\nFrom what I understand, the Mac has a partition where UEFI systems can boot and in this particular case boots Windows from that partition and then control is passed to whatever is located on the external drive. I became aware of this here.\nI would like to be able to boot this Windows installation from other Macs without running the bcdboot command as that would imply booting the Windows installer and running cumbersome operations.\nI also know that a USB stick can boot the system (this is what macOS installer and Windows installed do). So... my question is this:\nCan you create a USB stick that boots up the system and passes control to my USB drive with Windows installed on it? Or maybe change the Windows USB drive to allow it to boot?\nI don't understand the whole booting process but my guess would be that a bootloader could be installed on a USB stick and that would allow me to boot Windows.\n\nA: \nNote: Installing Windows 10 on an external drive has answered several times here a Ask Different. Most notable with the question Is it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD?\n\nBelow is a specific answer to your question: Or maybe change the Windows USB drive to allow it to boot? To implement this solution, you will need to reinstall Windows to the external drive. This solution does not include instructions for removing the Windows boot files from your internal drive.

For example, I have an old Canon scanner hanging off of a Raspberry Pi. To initiate a scan I can do this:\nssh pi@raspsky 'scanimage -x 105 -y 149 --resolution 300 > scan.ppm'\n\nHowever, now I want to send a command from the Pi to the Mac. The command contains single quotes:\nosascript -e 'display notification \"Image capture failed!\"'\n\nBut, I need to put single quotes around the entire command. I don't know how to do that. I've tried escaping the single quotes, but that doesn't work.\n\nA: Here is an example I tested: zsh -c 'osascript -e \"display dialog \\\"hi\\\"\"'\nosascript -e doesn't need single-quotes, and it works fine with double-quotes. Osascript also has good escaping, so I escaped the quotes inside osascript and used single-quotes for the enclosing command. For you it would be:\nssh <username>@<Mac-host> 'osascript -e \"display notification \\\"Image capture failed!\\\"'\n\nTesting it on my pi, it works. If you want to make a single command, I'd recommend creating a shell script which contains\nscanimage -x 105 -y 149 --resolution 300 > scan.ppm || ssh <username>@<Mac-host> 'osascript -e \"display notification \\\"Image capture failed!\\\"'\n\nand running that via SSH on your Mac, as I don't think this would work if you put this inside another set of '', which would occur if you send this entire command over ssh.\n", "Q: Stop Google account being shared between apps on iPhone When I install and sign in to Google Hangouts (family won't switch to Signal) on my iPhone, Google Maps suddenly knows about it, and either signs me in automatically to the same Google account or keeps telling me I'm missing out by not signing in.

Any idea how to fix this?\n(I can't confirm it but I think this issue started with one of the latest macOS updates, 11.3 or 11.4)\nEDIT: Display preferences\n\n\nA: Can you check out the RDM app http://avi.alkalay.net/software/RDM/? You should be able to manually set your refresh rate. This may fix issues. It may be driving at 8K @ 30 because running at 8K @ 60 = 4x 4K @ 60. When you have another display, it (incorrectly) realizes it doesn't have enough power and switches to 30 fps. Remember that the mac may be rendering at a higher resolution (8k) and scaling it up (like how the 5k imacs work). This could be wasting gpu power because of the incorrect resolution data (should be 4k, not 8k). RDM may help fix this by giving the actual resolution and FPS being used.\n", "Q: Safari: shortcut to close one single tab without loading the webpage? I always have a lot of tabs open. I would like to close them quickly, but since there are a lot of them and they are very small, I don't see the “x” that closes a single Safari tab. Looks like I need to click on them one by one and reload the page.\nActually, if I hover on a tab, I can see a preview, which is helpful.\nQUESTION\nI wonder if there is a shortcut that would allow me to close one single tab after I see the preview.\nRight now, if I don't want to open the web page, I can right-click on the tab and I see a menu, from which I can pick \"Close Tab\", but how could I achieve this more quickly?\n\n\nA: You could pinch to zoom out into the tabs overview view (or use the toolbar button for it), at which point you're presented with previews of every page as well as their respective X button.\nSome of the pages will probably load while in this view, but generally not in a way that slows down your interaction with the tabs, which I assume is the important thing.\n\nA: There is no function available to access the [X] when the tab is so short.

This spans to other applications too that we constantly get tickets requesting software to be updated. Apple support shut it down completely, however I'm not convinced.\nWe are running Catalina.\n\nA: The user can install the app in a folder in their own home directory, which makes it possible for them to update it.\nThe main /Applications folder is for system-wide applications, where it makes sense that only Administrator users can change them.\n", "Q: 2012 Mac pro on High Sierra 10.13.6 doesn't play DVDs anymore.

Either way, has anyone else experienced this and knows of something I could do to view DVDs again without splashing out on a new machine? Software or driver etc, ideas welcome\n\nA: iDVD was always OS X version dependent and was software to create DVDs.  It was removed in High Sierra.\nAs a player, you can use DVD Player which is included in High Sierra.\nIf DVD Player doesn't work, you may have a hardware issue.\n", "Q: Office 365 shortcuts conflict with chrome shortcuts? The following reference for Outlook 2016 on macOS  lists CMD-N as \"new message\". However that is already \"owned\" by chrome and in fact launches a new Chrome window. Is that list of shortcuts incorrect? Or is there something else I must do to use those shortcuts?\n\nA: ⌘ Command N is a universal Mac keyboard shortcut only that means, \"create something new in this app.\"\nIn MS Word it is a new MS Word document. In mail.app it is a new mail message. In Chrome/Firefox/Safari it is a new browser window, and so on.\nThere are other such keyboard shortcuts on the Mac that are similar in different apps and some that are identical. ⌘ Command P springs to mind as the way to print the current view in whatever app you are using.\nNote that macOS is DIFFERNT than Linux and Windows as closing a Window does not (necessarily) quit out of the app itself. When you see Google Chrome but get a new Outlook message look at the top of your screen. Just to the right of the Apple menu, is the name of the currently active app.\nThe important thing to do is click on the window, look up to verify you are in the expected app and then do your keyboard shortcut.\nIf you come from Windows or Linux it is weird, confusing and \"just plain wrong!\" But that is the way the Mac works and has always worked.\n", "Q: Different SSL certs being delivered to different platforms I received reports of an invalid SSL cert on a site that I recently started managing. Testing it on a Linux PC and a Windows PC, I find that the cert being delivered is different from the one delivered on an Apple mobile device.\nThe server is running Apache 2.4, and I can see that the invalid cert is set up in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf. The correct cert is set up in /etc/httpd/vhosts/mydomain.conf.\nIs this a common issue? What's going on here? (I don't want to make big changes to the server config because it's been around since before I got here, and Apache is serving multiple virtual hosts.)\n\nA: This is due to Apple being one of the (earliest?) vendors enforcing full compliance with RFC 1035 which only allows letters, digits, and hyphens for domain names. The CA/Browser Forum has sunset underscores since 2019, but the CAs can't prevent you from using underscore in wildcard cert, and it seems that browser makers still allow the domain to be validated, except Apple.\nSince iOS 14 and probably Big Sur, Safari won't send SNI for domains with an underscore, which is why you get the default cert. Unfortunately, while in Big Sur other browsers seems to use their own TLS library, it appears in iOS all browsers are required to use the built-in library.\nIf you only have a single domain with an underscore in its name, a probable (I'm not sure if the iOS will actually validate the cert, it works on desktop Safari) workaround will be using the cert for that domain as your default cert. Otherwise, you're forced to change all of those domains using underscores.\n", "Q: Does the iPad Smart Connector have charging functionality? In the comments under an answer on another question, a user commented that the Smart Connector on an iPad (7th generation) is\n\n\"not a charging system\"\n\nand that\n\n\"the [Apple Smart] keyboard doesn't charge by the smart connector. The\nkeyboard is changed by the usb-c port. The iPad is charged via the\nusb-c port and pass-through charging thru the smart connector.\"\n\nHowever, at least one (non-Apple) keyboard appears to both pair and charge via the Smart Connector:\n\nRugged Folio for iPad (7th and 8th generation) is a slim keyboard case\nwith drop protection that exceeds military standard tests. It uses\nSmart Connector technology so no pairing or charging is required. High\nperformance spill and dirt-resistant sealed keys make this the perfect\ntool for on-the-go work. Enjoy a full-size keyboard with convenient\niOS® shortcut keys, front and back protection for your iPad, and a\nconvenient spot to stow Logitech Crayon or Apple Pencil® (1st gen).\n\n(Emphasis added.)\nSo my questions:\n\n*\n\n*Does either the Smart Keyboard Folio or Smart Keyboard charge via the Smart Connector?  Is the answer different on the 7th generation and 8th generation iPads?\n\n*If the answer to 1 is \"Yes\", does the 8th generation iPad use the same connector to charge the Apple Pencil 2, or does it use a separate magnetic induction system to do that?  (Note that the 8th gen iPad is compatible with the Pencil 2, even though the 7th gen is not.)  If the latter, is there a reason why?  It seems weirdly redundant to build two different systems for charging accessories into the sides of the iPad.\n\n\nA: I see Apple smart connector devices similar to wired USB keyboards and mice that run on low voltage DC and have no batteries to charge and no Bluetooth to pair, but I could be misinformed.\n\nUnlike Bluetooth keyboards, you don't need to pair or turn on your Smart Keyboard Folio or Smart Keyboard.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205237\n\nA: Question 1:\nNo, the Smart Keyboard Folio and the Smart Keyboard do not charge via the Smart Connector. The reason being simply that these devices do not have batteries. There's nothing to charge. They are being powered by the Smart Connector though.\nQuestion 2:\nThe answer to question 1 was no, but I'll expand on this:\nThe Apple Pencil 2 does not charge through the Smart Connector, nor is it powered through the Smart connector on any iPad.\nWhen you ask about Apple's \"reason why\" - it's unfortunately not possible to answer by anyone but the people at Apple involved in that decision.\nHowever, from a purely logical standpoint, there's a number of possible reasons:\n\n*\n\n*The Smart Connector contrary to the Apple Pencil 2 charging system is not a charging system nor is it wireless.\n\n\n*As the Smart Connector is not wireless, but requires physical contact between the 3 points on the iPad and similar 3 points on the accessory, it is probably much easier to get a large keyboard with magnets embedded on the large connecting edge to position and align properly to create that physical contact between the points.\n\n\n*The Smart Connector is not only not a charger, but it is also performs a completely different function as it also transfers data. There is a 1-wire protocol embedded into it that allows the iPad and the accessory to communicate through that (instead of over some additional, wireless system).\n", "Q: Is there a good replacement for Growl/Prowl? I have several remote Raspberry Pies from which I have been sending notices to my Mac and iOS devices using a combination of Growl and Prowl. Growl is no longer supported. Beginning with Catalina, Growl crashed quite often and with Big Sur it is very unstable. I'm looking for a replacement messaging system that I can use with existing bash scripts on the remote Pies.\nI can use Prowl's API to send messages to the iOS devices, but not to the Mac. I can use OSASCRIPT via SSH to send messages to the Mac, but they don't make it to the iOS devices. I can use email which gets to all devices, but ends up making a very cluttered inbox. I've looked at Boxcar, but it seems to be a little much for my needs.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I use an app called Pushover which has apps for the Mac and iPhone/iPad. It can receive messages of various levels of “urgent-ness” even to the point of being allowed to bypass “Do Not Disturb” on iOS 14 if you so choose.\nPushover has an API that allows you to send messages using curl and it is very easy to use, and has very generous usage allowances. Using curl also means that it should work from a Raspberry Pi or any other Unix-y system.\nThe iPhone/iPad app, Android app, and Mac cost $5 each (iPhone and iPad is a single $5 purchase, Android is $5, Mac app is $5). These are one-time purchases, not subscriptions.\nThis is a service I had used since 2014 and found to be extremely reliable, easy to use, and inexpensive. I highly recommend it.\nI wrote up an example shell script to show how to use it, which I call po.sh (for pushover obviously).\n", "Q: Applescript: customizing the UI button options I’m trying to use Applescript to produce a simple UI menu, but instead of the default “OK”, and “Cancel” I would like to change the behavior to the following:\n[Dialog title at top]\n“Cancel” changed to “Exit”\n“OK” changed to “Run”\nHave the “Run” button execute a BASH script in the current folder.\nCode thus far (not much):\nosascript -e 'display dialog \"Press RUN to execute the Optimizer\" with title \"Optimizer\"'\n\nA: To display a dialogue with osascript, try:\necho \"set ddr to display dialog \\\"Press RUN to execute the Optimizer\\\" with title \\\"Optimizer\\\" buttons {\\\"Exit\\\", \\\"Run\\\"} default button \\\"Run\\\" cancel button \\\"Exit\\\"\" | osascript -\n\nThat runs the following applescript command from the shell:\nset ddr to display dialog \"Press RUN to execute the Optimizer\" ¬\nwith title \"Optimizer\" buttons {\"Exit\", \"Run\"} ¬\ndefault button \"Run\" cancel button \"Exit\"\n\nNote that in the echo, the \" are escaped but the {} are not.

Many UI elements report Parent does not report element as one of its children when using Accessibility Inspector of Xcode, which then make it impossible to communicate with them. Or some code may work one time and then not the next. I wrote some code that opened to Wi-Fi and clicked the Show in Menu Bar checkbox. It worked a few times and now it doesn't.\nThe original code I wrote which sporadically worked I'll not post, however, the following example AppleScript code does consistently work as tested under macOS Big Sur 11.4, albeit it is what I consider kludgy UI Scripting, as it's visible on screen, is prone to failure due to timing issues, or if the hierarchical UI element structures change due to macOS updates/upgrades.\nThe example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested in Script Editor under macOS Big Sur 11.4 with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate setting in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nThis script requires that the Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls checkbox is checked on the System Preferences >  Keyboard > Shortcuts tab, and as coded, the script checks its status and toggles the checkbox, as necessary, based on its current status.\nThis script also first checks to see if the Wi-Fi icon is shown on the Menu Bar and if not, then halt execution of the script, as its purpose is to act only if it is shown on the Menu Bar.\n\n\nExample AppleScript code:\n--  # Get the fully qualified POSIX pathname of the target .plist file.\n\nset thePropertyListFilePath to ¬\n    the POSIX path of ¬\n        (path to preferences from user domain as string) & ¬\n    \"com.apple.controlcenter.plist\"\n\n-- Get the value of 'NSStatusItem Visible WiFi' to determine if the\n-- Wi-Fi icon is showing on the Menu Bar, and if it's not, then halt\n-- execution of the script, as its purpose is to act only if it is.\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    tell the property list file thePropertyListFilePath to ¬\n        set |Wi-Fi Menu Bar Icon Status| to the value of ¬\n            the property list item ¬\n                \"NSStatusItem Visible WiFi\"\n\nif |Wi-Fi Menu Bar Icon Status| is false then return\n\n\n--  # Check to see if System Preferences is \n--  # running and if yes, then close it.\n--  # \n--  # This is done so the script will not fail \n--  # if it is running and a modal sheet is \n--  # showing, hence the use of 'killall' \n--  # as 'quit' fails when done so, if it is.\n--  #\n--  # This is also done to allow default behaviors\n--  # to be predictable from a clean occurrence.\n\nif running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n    try\n        tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n    on error\n        do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\"\n    end try\n    delay 0.1\nend if\n\n--  # Make sure System Preferences is not running before\n--  # opening it again.

I have tried re-installing the app (deleting it and downloading a new file), but I still get the following screen on macOS 11.3 (Big Sur):\n\nAnyone else getting this same issue, and how to resolve?\n\nA: Faced the same black screen, it was fixed by updating the WhatsApp application. Clicked command + space, typed \"App Store\", found WhatsApp, and clicked update.\n\nA: Deleting an app & re-installing usually changes nothing.\nIf the app itself will not work on any particular OS, then the developers will have to fix it; however, if it's simply a setting in your own machine, then you need to find & clear all the settings files.\nThe first one to try is in ~/Library/Saved Application State/ The saved state for each app is then in a folder called com.company.product/ [as I've no idea who makes What'sApp I'll leave that to you.] Once you find the folder just delete it & try launch again.\nIf that doesn't work, then there are many app removers on the web which will do a more complete job. One I've used many times over the years is AppCleaner (Freeware).\nLaunch it, drop your WhatsApp app onto it & see what it finds. Be careful you don't discard anything you might need to keep. It will find & delete all history if you let it, but you can uncheck files you need to keep. You can also show the locations of all files, so you can make copies in case anything goes wrong.\nOnce done, drag WhatsApp back out of the bin into Applications & try again. You can rinse & repeat this until you're sure you threw out just the correct files if it doesn't go smoothly first time.\nOne thing to note - any files you need to put back must be put back manually with this method. Only files that were deleted by the Finder will have a specific \"Put Back\" option once in the Trash.\n\nA: There was some kind of bug. This resolved itself eventually.\n", "Q: \"Invalid Email address\" error when attempting to change account password on iPhone and iPad I use Gmail. Recently I received an e-mail from Google informing me that my account may have been compromised. I verified this by logging into Google itself where I got the same message: that they had recently blocked an attempt to sign in. The problem is, when examining the login history, it just stated \"unknown device\" - and did not reveal any IP address. I had no way of telling whether it was actually one of my own devices, or someone else who was attempting to access my account.\nI decided to play it safe and change my Google password anyway. So far so good. However, when attempting to change it on my iPhone I encountered a problem. When I tapped \"Done\", I got a pop-up message\n\nInvalid Email address\nPlease enter a valid email address for this account.\n\nI was unable to save the new password. My e-mail address had not been changed: the only thing I wanted to do was change the password recorded on the account settings. Suspecting that it might be an issue with my iPhone, I tried it on my iPad - with exactly the same result.\nThe strange thing is that when I typed in my OLD password, it worked (i.e it allowed me to save the settings screen: it did not allow access to mail, because it was the wrong password).\nDoes anyone know what's going on? Unfortunately I can't include a screenshot from my devices, because I'm unable to e-mail them to myself because of this error. Right now I'm stuck with no access to e-mail on my Apple devices. Grateful for any insights.\nGoogle won't let me revert to my old password because I used it too recently.\n\nA: I solved this myself - but am posting the answer here in case it is of any use to others.\nIt's actually a change in how gmail recognises user names. While previously the username had to include the whole e-mail address, with @gmail.com - now it does not have to. So I only had to remove the @gmail.com portion of the username field, and the problem was resolved. The only remaining mystery is why, given the obvious change, it was still working until recently with my own account settings! But that is another question.\n\nA: In my case this appears to have been due to aliases in the Email sub-menu of the account settings, which were themselves not valid logins. It's not clear to me whether iOS is checking the password against each of these or if it's some other bug. Changing the default address from an alias to one with a genuine login was insufficient - I needed to delete the aliases before it would accept a new password. There were also some issues with it not seeming to save the new password: having appeared to have accept it, checking for new mail would fail and state no password was supplied. I force-closed the Settings and Mail apps a few times and tried again until it worked.\n", "Q: Make iPad Pro Screen Bigger with External Monitor? If I display my iPad on an external monitor, does it just mirror the iPad screen, or can I actually get more content? I have a work iPad that I would like to use as a desktop, with the goal of displaying significantly more information than I can display on the 10\" screen.\n\nA: Other than specific apps that support multi-screen mode, the iPad will be exactly mirrored. The iPad doesn't care if it's a 7-inch or 70-inch screen, and it will only mirror. The apps that support an external display are few and far between, and there are probably only a single-digit number of them. I'm sorry if your goal was to get more space on an external monitor using an iPad, but it won't happen natively (I guess it could happen with jailbreaking?).\n", "Q: Why does invitations sent from Apple software to users with GMail- or Hotmail-based Apple ID:s get mangled?

However, the number of characters varies from file to file. It is not always as shown in the example, the key part is removing up to and including the first underscore, _.\nThe issue is that I need the script to keep the rest of the name intact, regardless of what it is.  I need a script that supports different text below.\nExample:\nI have this item:\n\"LPLLORMF_1023_PM_48_24_25\"\nI need to remove the first part of the name, in this case \"LPLLORMF_\"\nResult: \"1023_PM_48_24_25\"\nThe second part, 1023_PM_48_24_25 in this case, wont always be the same, I mean that I would like to maintain this part whatever it may be.

Depending on the original name, each one will be given a new specific name. Subsequently, each file will be moved to a different folder. At the moment everything works correctly in Automator.The only thing I have not managed to do, is to remove the first part of the text (which may contain 3, 4 or 5 characters and the subsequent underscore) without altering the rest of the original name.\nuser3439894, I really appreciate your help.

What can I be doing wrong? Thanks again for your help!\nThank you very much for your interest user3439894. I apologize for so many questions, I am an engineer, not a programmer, and this is proving to be more difficult than expected. I currently have a worflow that works (except for removing those first characters), based on identifying files according to some characters in their name, renaming them according to their type, and moving them to different folders.\nMy idea, to make everything perfect, is to run the AppleScript at the beginning of the workflow, after \"Ask for Finder Items\".

How clumsy of me, sorry I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO IT.....\n\nA: \nMy idea, to make everything perfect, is to run the AppleScript at the beginning of the workflow, after \"Ask for Finder Items\".\n\nYou can use the following example AppleScript code in a Run AppleScript action in an Automator workflow directly after an Ask for Finder Items action, and it will pass a list of Finder aliases of the newly renamed files to the next Automator action:\n\nExample AppleScript code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    \n    set newFilenameList to {}\n    \n    repeat with thisItem in input\n        \n        set oriFilename to the POSIX path of thisItem\n        \n        set newFilename to ¬\n            text ((offset of \"_\" in oriFilename) + 1) ¬\n                thru -1 of oriFilename\n        \n        try\n            tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n                set name of file oriFilename to newFilename\n        end try\n        \n        set newPathFilename to getDirNameOf(oriFilename) & newFilename\n        set newPathFilename to POSIX file newPathFilename\n        set newPathFilename to newPathFilename as alias\n        copy newPathFilename to the end of newFilenameList\n        \n    end repeat\n    \n    return newFilenameList\n    \nend run\n\nto getDirNameOf(FQP)\n    set FQP to the reverse of characters of FQP as string\n    set FQP to text (offset of \"/\" in FQP) thru -1 of FQP\n    set FQP to the reverse of characters of FQP as string\n    return FQP\nend getDirNameOf\n\n\n\nNotes:\nReplace the default code of the Run AppleScript action with the example AppleScript code shown above.\nThe Automator action prior to this, the Ask for Finder Items action, should be set to:  Type: [Files] [√] Allow Multiple Selection\nAs currently coded, the example AppleScript code only renames files, not folders.\nIf you want to return a list of POSIX path file names instead of Finder aliases, then remove or comment out:\nset newPathFilename to POSIX file newPathFilename\nset newPathFilename to newPathFilename as alias\n\n\nThe other option is to use a second Ask for Finder Items action after the Run AppleScript action as shown in this example Automator workflow, including its code, to acquire the proper fully qualified pathnames of the renamed files. Note the [Options] setting on the second Ask for Finder Items action in the linked image.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

For some reason CPU usage goes to 80-90% across all cores when this happens, although the temperature remains steady at ~60C (so I don't think it's CPU throttling or anything like that). Opening Activity Monitor shows that kernel_task consumes most of that CPU, which I understand it to be part of the OS, although I don't know why it suddenly spikes. I've monitored GPU temps when this happens, and they also seem to be somewhere in the 60s C most of the time. I don't think that's hot enough for throttling, although I don't know for sure.\nThe issue persists whether I use an USB-C to HDMI dock, or a USB-C to DP cable. Disconnecting the external monitor for a few minutes resolves the issue, but it inevitably happens again once I reconnect it.\nI've tried a few things like resetting the SMC (at least I think I have; the OS gives you no confirmation), or connected the power cable and monitor on different sides, but to no avail.\nAny solutions to this problem?

The current slow manual way of removing GPS data from images is to double click or manually open the image in the Preview App, go to Tools menu, click the Show Location Info menu option, click the [GPS] button, and finally click the [Remove Location Info] button, and then save the image.\nIt's okay in a pinch, but gets tiresome quickly, especially if trying to process multiple images.\nWas thinking that maybe a \"Quick Action\" can be created with Automator or similar, so it can be used in Finder by right-clicking on one or more images and actioning a \"Remove GPS Info\" quick action.\nI'm running Catalina 10.15.7.\nIs this possible, and if so, how?\n\nA: Create a Automator Quick Action setting Workflow receives current [image files] in [Finder] and add a Run Shell Script action to it, setting Shell: [/bin/zsh] and Pass input: [as arguments], using the following example shell script code:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    /usr/local/bin/exiftool -overwrite_original -gps:all= \"$f\"\ndone\n\n\n\nNotes:\nThis Automator Quick Action requires the use of the third-party utility ExifTool.\nChange the fully qualified pathname of exiftool to whatever it is on your system. On my system I install it to /usr/local/bin/, noting that the directory may not already exist.\nAlso note that as coded, this overwrites the original image file. If you do not want to overwrite the original, then remove -overwrite_original from the exiftool command line options.\nTo use, select the image file(s) in Finder and the select e.g. Remove GPS Location Info on the Services menu/context menu.\nYou can also assign the Automator Quick Action a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nNote that you'll need to pick a keyboard shortcut not already in use by Finder.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How can I find deleted Apple Mail attachments in Time Machine? I deleted some I need now, but I haven't found them. Where do they live? Thanks.\n\nA: Think of a date before you deleted them and, using Finder, go to the corresponding backup.\nIn Big Sur, each backup looks like a separate disk inside you TM disk.  In Catalina it is a folder in your TM disk.\nBefore going further, make sure that Finder is showing you hidden files and folders. Command-Shift-Dot to enable this.\nWithin the chosen dated folder drill down to your Mail folder which is inside your username's Library.  Like this:\n\nIf you have more than one mail account (like me) there will be multiple folders within V8.  You will have to try each one.\nGoing deeper:\n\nFirst go down folders just like the folders within Mail, but below the folder Data, it is just guess work.\nFinally there are folders for a few Messages and their Attachments.\nExplore!\nWhen you do find the lost attachments, just copy (drag and drop) them to your Desktop or wherever is convenient.\nIn case you are wondering, I have decided there is nothing sensitive in the names of my folders and so have not attempted to hide anything in my examples.\n", "Q: How to blur an image halfway/not fully in keynote?

Anything that is listed there can be used.\n\nA: When searching using Finder, the kind: tag is populated from multiple fields in the Spotlight index. As well as kMDItemKind field it may use elements of the multivalued field kMDItemContentTypeTree where they are appropriate.\nThe complex (non-obvious) nature of the kind: search tag can be seen by a Finder search with kind:document.  As well as files with 'document' somewhere in the kMDItemKind field, this finds files with other words in the kMDItemKind field. Just as an example, search results include some .gpx files (tracking logs) which have the text 'GPX File' in the kMDItemKind field. Finder/Spotlight is identifying these as documents based on the kMDItemContentTypeTree field which is:\nkMDItemContentTypeTree = (\n    \"com.apple.dt.document.gpx\",\n    \"public.xml\",\n    \"public.text\",\n    \"public.data\",\n    \"public.item\",\n    \"public.content\"\n)\n\nThe public.text indicates a file readable like a 'document'.\nThe above discussion is primarily to show that predicting exactly what will be returned with a kind: Finder search is not simple. Nevertheless the content of the kMDItemKind field is a key part of this. So there is some value in knowing what kind: values are available from kMDItemKind.\nThe list of kinds in kMDItemKind is only limited by your actual files and and how the Spotlight importers populate the field. Lets look at how to get a list of 'kinds':\nMethod 1:\nWe can inspect the spotlight metadata of every file and extract just the kMDItemKind attribute. That will list all the Kinds which will return results. The script I give here is extremely slow, so:\n\n*\n\n*Only run it over important directories (not everything)\n\n*Hope somebody else can make it more efficient\n\nMy one line script (running on my Documents folder):\nfind ~/Documents -type f -exec mdls -name kMDItemKind '{}' \\; | sort -u -o DocumentsKind.txt\nIf it is not obvious, this runs the find command to get all files (-type f), executes the mdls command on its output to get just the Kind metadata, and finally pipes into sort which also removes duplicate lines.\nThe start of the output file for my Documents folder is:\nkMDItemKind = \"7-Zip Archive\"\nkMDItemKind = \"AIFF audio\"\nkMDItemKind = \"ASCII graphic document\"\nkMDItemKind = \"Adobe Illustrator File\"\nkMDItemKind = \"Adobe Photoshop PCX file\"\nkMDItemKind = \"Adobe Photoshop actions file\"\nkMDItemKind = \"Adobe Photoshop file\"\nkMDItemKind = \"Adobe Photoshop monitor setup file\"\nkMDItemKind = \"Alias\"\nkMDItemKind = \"Apple icon image\"\n.......\n\nMethod 2 (much easier):\nUse the app File List Export from the App Store.  For any folder it will list all files beneath it and with lots of attributes.  And those attributes include the \"Kind\".\nThe huge result table can be exported to a CSV or directly into Excel, where it can be sorted by Kind and duplicates removed.\nNote: The two methods didn't give me exactly the same list!\n", "Q: How to modify macOS BigSur system sounds?

[Reposted from https://macosx.com/threads/foo2zjs-driver-for-hp-laserjet-1018.327123/ and https://askubuntu.com/questions/1345298/install-foo2zjs-driver-on-macos-x.]\nI have a friend who uses MacOS X 11.2 Big Sur and she would like to print to an HP LaserJet 1018.\nI use Ubuntu, and I just plugged in the printer to my spiffy System76 laptop's USB port, waited a few seconds, got a pop-up message the printer was installed, and printed my stuff.\nMy System76 laptop uses the foo2zjs driver in CUPS for the printer, evidently, but I can't figure out how to download/compile/install that driver on her OS X laptop. The website http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/ appears to be permanently down, so I can't even download it from there. I installed HomeBrew and CakeBrew on her machine; a solution using CakeBrew would be just stellar.\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You can access the foo2zjs website on the WayBack Machine:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210129024712/http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/\nYou could also try using Pacifist (a third-party app that lets you browse through .pkg files and install the contents, regardless of any compatibility checks. I would be surprised if the drivers for your printer in the HP v5.1 set didn't still work.\n\nA: The amount of hoop jumping required to add the macOS Big Sur CUPS driver is not worth the effort. The combination of SIP (System Integrity Protection) and the signed bootable APFS snapshot macOS System volume makes it very difficult to add the CUPS driver even if you could locate the driver source and compile it yourself since the original foo2zjs driver doesn't appear to be accessible any longer.\nThe printer is 12+ years old. Apple had issues with some other non-CUPS HP printer drivers whose drivers weren't notarized and the solution was to use AirPrint instead of drivers from HP. Most all new printers support Bonjour/ZeroConf/AirPrint.\nTry going to the Mac App Store and searching for HP Smart for Desktop and installing that. With luck, it will detect the USB printer and offer a compatible driver for Big Sur. If that doesn't work then you may need to pursue a print server solution.\nThere are expensive commercial products such as the LANTRONIX xPrintServer which sells new for $363.40. But if you search eBay you can find an older used one under $60 USD. You plug the USB cable into the xPrintServer box as well as Ethernet & power and it makes the printer available over AirPrint to multiple devices including mobile devices. Big Sur will certainly be able to automatically add any AirPrint printer. Or you could build a DIY tiny computer such as a RaspberryPi, etc. running Linux with CUPS and AirPrint capabilities. That might be a fun little project and you could run other things on the RaspberryPi such as Pi-Hole or home automation projects. That option would cost more in materials and time spent.\nThe other alternative to consider buying a new printer. New models all support AirPrint and newer small desktop LaserJets are cheaper than the original cost of the HP LaserJet 1018 printer. You'll get better speed and more importantly, support for years to come.\n", "Q: What Visual Cue Is Available To Show Safari 14.1's Tab Bar Is Scrollable?

I'm currently running iPadOS 14.6 and I don't understand how Files app integration with cloud storages works.\nI have Yandex.Disk application (think of it as Google Drive alternative) which does have its own \"Offline\" section, so I can download some files and access them locally without internet connection.\nI also have Yandex.Disk visible in stock Files app and I can download files from there. The issue is that I have no idea how to delete files which were cached in Files app.\nFor example: when I open Files app and download some 1 Gb file from Yandex.Disk opened in Files, I do see that Yandex.Disk cache was increased in 1 Gb (System Settings -> Storage), however there is no \"Delete\" option in Files since it shows Yandex.Disk mounted as \"Read-only\". For now the only way I see to clear that cache is to completely delete the app and re-install it.\nWhat's wrong with the Files app?\nedit: I'd like to add some extra info to this question since more people may encounter this. I had a chat with Apple Support and they confirmed that there's no \"Clear cache\" option in Files app and it should clear cache \"automatically after some time\". They also suggested opening a feature request ticket at https://apple.com/feedback\n\nA: Not having used Yandex.Disk before, it is difficult to say exactly how to go about fixing this. The only similar experience that I've had based on your description was when I had a OneDrive account through school and certain folders were considered to be read only. In that case I simply was not able to change things in those folders, which was (I assume) an intended aspect of the OneDrive app. My best guess is that the developer(s) of the Yandex.Disk app either limited this functionality intentionally, or haven't updated the app to do be able to take advantage of the files app.\nMy suggestion would be to just do everything in the Yandex.Disk app and forgo the Files app completely since the app's page on the app store does seem to indicate an offline mode which presumably allows you to remove downloaded files and folders. Also, since this is most likely a problem with the Yandex.Disk app and not the Files app, you could try sending feedback or a support ticket to the developer to ask about this.\n\nA: \nI don't understand how Files app integration with cloud storages\nworks.\n\nThe first thing to know is that iPadOS does not store files like Windows, Linux or macOS does on computers.\nOn computers, you can directly create folders and save and organise your files in whatever folder anywhere on your disk. (Apps on computers will thus ask you where you want to save a file). But on iPadOS, a user doesn't create folders to organise their files in it. The iPadOS does this automatically for you.\nWhen you install a particular app from the App Store, like Pages or MS Word, iPadOS automatically creates a folder (or more than one, if necessary) for each app. The app then usually save any files created by it in these specific folder(s). Other apps aren't allowed to directly access them - only you can manually open file from another app's Folder.\nThis allows iPadOS to automatically organise the files in your device and also keeps it secure.\nThis is why when you open the Files app and select 'On My Device' (under 'Locations'), you will see that all the folders shown in it are named after the apps you have installed on your device.\n(Note: Latest versions of the Files app now allows you to create your own folders too).\nThe Files app also integrates with online storage services, like iCloud Drive and Yandex.Disk, and these can be accessed under 'Locations'. Tapping any of these locations will show you all the files that you have uploaded to these services.\n\nI also have Yandex.Disk visible ... and I can download files from\nthere. The issue is that I have no idea how to delete files which were cached in Files app.\n\nApparently, the Files app has a different approach of working with cloud based storage.\nIf you tap to open any file from any cloud storage services, the Files app tries to simulate the experience of opening a file from them similar to you opening a file from your device.\nSince this cached file acts like a direct link to your file on the cloud storage service, iPadOS doesn't allow you to delete it manually. (With iCloud, any changes you make to these files - like a Pages or Word Document - will also be saved directly to the file on iCloud).\nSo opening a file directly from a cloud based service in Files app is not equivalent to downloading it permanently for offline use.\nThis is the confusion you are experiencing with the Files app - you think you are downloading a copy of the file from the cloud storage, where as iPadOS treats it like a link to the file on the cloud storage.\nTo actually download a copy of the file from iCloud or Yandex.Disk to your device that you have full control over, you have to copy the file to a folder in your device in the Files app. (See - Use the Files app on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch - to know how to do this).\nAs for the cached files, they are automatically deleted by iPadOS when you are running out of disk space. The cached files can also be deleted by signing-out of the cloud storage service. (More details here - Can’t delete ‘locally stored’ content in the Files app? Here’s what’s going on).\n\nYandex.Disk mounted as \"Read-only\"\n\nAs @Shock9616 explained in another answer, Yandex.Disk may be \"Read-only\" by design on the Files app as Yandex would like you to use their own dedicated app Yandex.Disk. So it would be better to use Yandex's app when you are downloading or uploading files from Yandex.Disk.\n", "Q: The 'open ' command in Terminal and the 'Reveal file in Finder' option aren't working If you search for a file in Spotlight and command-click the file you expect the Finder to activate and show that file.

I have a screenshot of a web UI and I wish to blur the parts that are not relevant to the point being demonstrated, is there a way to blur / pixelate part of an image using Mac Preview?\nNote: the top ranking google result offers a highly substandard solution resulting in an obtrusive rectangle in place of the parts you want blurred - this is really not the same as subtle blurring that obscures information with minimal aesthetic interference with the look of the image.\n\nA: Preview is not a fully-fledged image editor, and has very limited capabilities.\nConceivably, you could export duplicate copies of the image with low-quality JPEG-ing until the image is unrecognisable, and then paste the relevant area onto the original. It might also be possible to lower the resolution of the duplicate image sufficiently with built-in OS tools.\nBut ideally, you will need a third-party image editing app with a Blur Tool.\n\nA: Gimp has an option to do this - https://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/plug-in-pixelize.html - though I've not tested it myself.\nThere's a more Mac-like port of Gimp, fully maintained, if you don't like the usual Windowsy look - https://www.partha.com/\nPersonally, I use Photoshop - it has a Mosaic function which can be applied to any selection.\n\n\nA: There actually is a way to achieve something like this effect in Preview, it's just a little manual.

You can make it cover the entire image to get the\nbackground blur effect.\n\n\n\n*With the Highlight shape selected, open the Adjust Color menu.\n\n*\n\n*Move the Sharpness slider to the left to blur\nthe background.\n\n*You can also move the Exposure, Contrast, and Saturation\nsliders to the left halfway or more to get the effect you want.\n\n\n\nAfter following these steps your image should have a slightly blurred and de-emphasized background, and a magnified area that emphasizes the part to which you want to direct attention. Note that you can't completely obscure information this way. You can, though, achieve a selective-attention effect.

I lost my private keys after formatting my Mac and reinstalling my OS. I only have the public keys and the passphrase. What can I do?\n\nA: Unfortunately, it is currently impossible (rather: computationally unfeasible) to recreate the private keys from the public keys (otherwise they wouldn't be \"private\", and public keys wouldn't be, as they are, safely discloseable to all and sundry). The passphrase is just an encryption of the private keys, and while required for their recovery, it is not per se sufficient - you still need the encrypted private keys.\nThere is, perhaps, some small hope of recovering said encrypted private keys from the formatted disk, since formatting is not the same thing as erasing. The private keys are small and their format is distinctive, so if they have not been overwritten by the OS reinstalled files, it is possible they're not only still lying somewhere in the free space of the disk, but they're in a single, recognizable and thus recoverable fragment.\nThe disk must be set off line as soon as possible to prevent further writes to increase the risk of overwriting the data, and the free area examined with forensic tools by an expert or at least someone familiar with the mechanics of this undertaking. The operation can take several hours depending on the hard disk size.\nIf the disk has been already filled with data, or worse, a \"secure erase\", \"secure format\", \"diagnostic rewrite\", or similar operation has been performed prior to the reinstallation, then recovery chances are nil - that's literally the point of a \"secure erase\".

Has anyone had a similar issue to this, and what can I do? I'm starting to think that maybe the SuperDrive is faulty but I'm unsure. I have an external DVD Drive but the iMac doesn't detect it in the boot options.\n\nA: I have the same model Mac as you. The machine is a 2.4 GHz 2007 20-inch iMac. I downloaded to my 2011 iMac the English version of the current 32 bit Windows 7 from Microsoft's website Download Windows 7 Disc Images (ISO Files). The file name is Win7_Pro_SP1_English_x32.iso. The 2011 iMac is running High Sierra (macOS 10.13.6). I used the 2011 iMac to burned the ISO file to a DVD‑RW.\nAt startup of the 2007 iMac, I held down the option key until the Mac Startup Manager icons appeared. I selected the text Windows under the DVD icon to boot from DVD. I was able to boot from the DVD without any problems. I would assume if you have followed the same procedure, then either you did not successfully burn the DVD or the optical drive on the 2007 Mac is faulty. Since you have tried using the Boot Camp Assistant, I assume the Mac can run OS X without any issues. Also, you stated you verified the firmware is up to date.\nThere a some fairly old posts here a Ask Different regarding the installation of 64 bit Windows 7 on a  Mac where the optical either no longer works or has been removed. For example, see the question Boot camp install of Windows 7 issue, no bootable devices.\nMore recently, a post has been made where Windows can be installed without using a DVD or a virtual machine by first installing Debian Linux. Once Debian is installed, Grub can be used to boot the Windows installer. See this answer. In your case, this answer would have to be modified to use a 64 bit Debian Linux and Windows 7.\n", "Q: How to stop the keychain alert 'xxx want to use the keychain' Recently my MacBook Pro (macOS v11.2.3 (Big Sur)) always pops up an alert:\nxxx want to use the xxxx keychain\n\nSometimes it pops up for 4-6 times. It pops up at a so high frequency  that I must enter the password again and again, and it makes me crazy. Why give that alert and what should I do to make it silent?\nThis is the alert window:\n\nnot just the git need me to enter the password, many other apps also need me to enter the password too. I have tried to turn the lock credential with a very long time. But seems still not work:\n\nyou would see that my credential was unlocked but it still want me to enter the password, I have to enter the password for more than 10 times, so hard to do like this.\n\nA: In Terminal check what you have set in your git config:\ngit config -l\n\nYou should see an entry for \"credential.helper=osxkeychain\" which is typically included if you installed git from Homebrew or have a newer macOS version such as Big Sur and the developer tools installed.\nThere is the option to set a cache timeout so you don't have to type your password to unlock the keychain every time you need git credentials.  Think of it like the timeout for sudo where it doesn't always ask for the password if you recently used the password.  You can adjust this cache timeout value to whatever you like.\nTo add a credential.helper cache timeout of an hour to your git config in Terminal:\ngit config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 3600'\n\n\nA: From the alert screenshot you have posted, it is clear that it happens whenever you use Git. You have stored your git credentials in the Keychain (which is the right way in macOS), and thus whenever you use Git, it asks the Keychain for the credentials. But not all apps are allowed access to the Keychain as it stores many other passwords / keys / certificates etc. So macOS informs you that this particular app wants access to the Keychain and you get the alert.\nTo avoid this alert, you can grant access to particular app(s) to only access specific credentials that it needs within Keychain, through the Keychain Access app. To do so:\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain Access (you can find it in Applications > Utilities).\n\n\n*Use the search field to search for your Git credential (e.g. \"Github\").\n\n\n*It should show the respective item below. Right-click the correct git credential and from the menu, click Get Info.\n\n\n*It will display a window like this (on macOS Mojave):\n\n\n\n*Click on the Access Control tab.\n\n\n*Under \"Always allow access by these applications:\", click the + sign and add the tool mentioned in the alert, i.e. \"git-credential-oskeychain\" (which I assume is the osxkeychain helper - this may be in different locations depending on whether you installed it using Homebrew or Xcode Command Line Tools).\n\n\n*Click Save Changes button.\n\n\n*Restart your computer.\nYou can also deselect Ask for Keychain password but (if I remember right) you may still get an alert whenever some tool wants to use it. It is a bad idea to select Allow all applications to access this item as it may allow any rogue application access to your git credentials.\nNote: James Brickley's answer is better in terms of security as by caching the password with a timeout, you only allow access to the credentials for a limited time. With the method I have described, the specific app will always have access to the git credentials till you disallow it from Keychain Acess.\n", "Q: How do I update my root certificates on an older version of Mac OS (e.g. El Capitan)? I have difficulty reaching various secure web sites. They give me a certificate expired error. They work on Firefox but not Safari or Chrome. They also work on newer versions of macOS (e.g. Catalina, Big Sur). This seems to be because Safari and Chrome use the OS root certificate store and Firefox uses its own, and El Capitan is not being updated.\nFrom here  there are:\n\n*\n\n*Trusted certificates establish a chain of trust that verifies other certificates signed by the trusted roots — for example, to establish a secure connection to a web server. When IT administrators create Configuration Profiles, these trusted root certificates don't need to be included.\n\n*Always Ask certificates are untrusted but not blocked. When one of these certificates is used, you'll be prompted to choose whether or not to trust it.\n\n*Blocked certificates are believed to be compromised and will never be trusted.\n\nThere is a list of fingerprints of the current certificates there, but no downloadable bundles of certificates.\nHow do I update my root certificates on an older version of OS X 10.11\n\nA: For anyone without access to an up-to-date Apple OS install: you can download the root certificate at cause (that one exclusively) from the issuer's site and install it. Instructions are here but double-check where in Keychain Access your system\nhas stored the expired R3 certificate (could be \"System Roots\" instead of \"System\").\nMacPorts have a port (apple-pki-bundle) which installs .pem file containing a bunch of certificates downloaded from Apple, GeoTrust and DigiCert (port source here. It does not at the moment include the ISRG certificate but I have to assume it contains at least a number of the certificates you'd get with the recipe outlined above. Checksumming ensures that you get the intended certificates; AFAICT you'll need to add the bundle to your system's root certificates yourself.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is to transfer your System Root certificates from another Mac to which you have access that runs a more modern version of macOS. (Why not just download them? See note that the end of this answer.)\n\n*\n\n*First find the more modern Mac with a working set of System Root certificates (i.e. that can access the problematic web sites)\n\n*On that Mac, launch Keychain Access, select \"System Roots\", select all the certificates, select File->Export, and export them as rootcerts.pem file. This file will contain all the certificates concatenated.\n\n*Copy the rootcerts.pem file to your antique mac\n\n*Make the trustroot shell script below, e.g. by copying it into a file, then using chmod 755 trustroot\n\n*Run sudo ./trustroot rootcerts.pem\n#!/bin/bash\nDIR=${TMPDIR}/trustroot.$$\nmkdir -p ${DIR}\ntrap \"rm -rf ${DIR}\" EXIT\ncat \"$1\" | (cd $DIR && /usr/bin/split -p '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----' - cert- )\nfor c in ${DIR}/cert-* ; do\n   security -v add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k \"/Library/Keychains/System.keychain\" \"$c\"\ndone\nrm -rf ${DIR}\n\nWhat the script does is splits the .pem file into a number of certificates in the temporary directory concerned, then adds them as trustRoot certificates to the System key chain; they will then operate as trusted roots in addition to the certificates in the original \"System Roots\" keychain. In case you were wondering, you cannot add them to the System Roots keychain as that can only be updated by the operating system.\nNote this copies over the first group of certificates (\"Trusted Certificates\" in the question), but not the second nor the third.\nKudos to this answer for a hint.\n\nYou might wonder why I didn't simply put a link to a more modern bundle of certificates somewhere on the web. After all, that would allow you to skip steps 1-3, and simply download rootcerts.pem. The answer is that you would have no way of knowing that I had not tampered with the root certificates and inserted one of my own, allowing me to impersonate any website by making a fake certificate signed with my own root certificate. Please therefore treat with extreme scepticism any advice to solve this problem by downloading root certificates from anywhere unless you have can independently check the provenance of those certificates.\nThat said, if you have no other option, a reasonable place to download a certificate bundle would be from the curl web site here (untested), as most people trust curl.\n\nA: Just tried these instructions on an old iMac Early 2009 with El Capitan (10.11.6)\n\nSome operating systems hold onto the expired R3 > DST Root CA X3 chain even if your server is no longer using it. Try a restart of the affected client device.\nFor older macOS not updated by Apple:\n\n*\n\n*Download the ISRG Root X1 certificate file from http://x1.i.lencr.org/\n\n*Open the Keychain Access app and drag that file into the System folder of that app.\n\n*Find the ISRG Root X1 certificate in System and double click on it, open the Trust menu and change \"Use System Defaults\" to \"Always Trust\", then close that and enter your password to confirm the change (if prompted).\n\n\neverything becomes to work as expected.\n", "Q: Is it feasible to repair the screen of an iPad 9.7\" by myself? I have an early 2018 iPad 9.7\" (not the pro version). Here is what it looks like currently: https://imgur.com/a/wPrl56r. The touch screen still works, so I think it's just the glass surface that's broken.\nI tried googling and going on ifixit.com to find resources on how to replace the screen, but it seems everything that's available is for the iPad pro 9.7\", so I'm not sure if that's applicable for me. I tried Googling as well, and it's the same issue.\nHas anyone attempted a glass screen replacement by themself before? I'm not great with my hands, but at the same time, I'm not sure if I have anything to lose by trying. The iPad is out of warranty, and cost of repair at Apple or a 3rd party would probably be more expensive than the iPad.\n\nA: It is not easy at all. Bloody everything is glued! So you have to carefully use a hair dryer (or ideally a heat gun) and apply the right pressure to remove such glued items. Too much heat or pressure or the wrong tool, and you end up with another damaged part.\nI have tried to repair an old iPad 2 whose battery needed replacement. In the process of opening the iPad, I accidently broke the screen ribbon cable! So now I had to repair two things.\nIdentifying the right part to buy needs research. Finding a compatible part (not original, as Apple doesn't supply it outside its authorised service centers) is a pain too, but with a little diligence on chinese ecommerce sites (like aliexpress.com) you can get it. (Ofcourse, you have to trust God and the chinese seller to not cheat you and ship you all the right working part along with the necessary tools).\nThis is not to discourage you in any manner - I just want to inform you to be ready to spend some time and be very careful while dismantling and reassembling the parts. It can be done but you may make mistakes as you learn to repair it. Watch many repair videos carefully and fully on Youtube (and other sites) before attempting it.\nIt is really sad that Apple lobbies against Right to Repair legislations in the US, and abroad when such things can really benefit us consumers, and only make a negligible impact on Apple's profit margin while also increasing its brand value.\n\nA: No.  Buy 4 broken iPads of that era for scrap value and work on those. You will know when you’re ready to work on a live iPad once you can tear down other ones without causing more physical damage to them.\n\n*\n\n*just getting the glass off without breaking the display cables is quite a feat let alone getting it all glued back together again.\n\n*Work on a tear down without breaking anything https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPad_6 and pay a pro to work on your device is my overall advice\n\nRepetition is what makes a good repair person, and careful research and the best tools. If you bend the frame of a phone or iPad or don’t know it’s bent, you will struggle with the tight tolerances. Sourcing parts is also a challenge.\nI strongly encourage people that are interested to try their hand at tear downs if you ensure you don’t start a fire from the lithium batteries and will responsibly recycle the parts afterwards with Apple or another reputable vendor. (Tear down meaning the goal is education and you know it will never work again.)\n", "Q: 'brew' command is not recognized by Terminal I have installed brew on my system using the command\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nNow, it seems that it was successfully installed. But when I type brew in Terminal, I get:\nzsh: command not found: brew\n\nHonestly, I do not know what zsh means. Some people say to just add some line to a certain file (I assume it is a configuration file for zsh). I think the file is ~/.zshrc, however, there is no such file on my system. How do I access it? Should I type vim ~/.zshrc in Terminal? How do I make my system recognize brew and all the other programs I would like to install?\nI typed vim ~/ .zshrc in Terminal which opened vim. I then typed \"i\" in order to edit the file but I get please type the directory name:. I wonder what should I type here?\n\nA: When installing brew on my new Macbook where I immediately added ZSH i ran into the same problem but If you look carefully at your installation you might see:\nWarning: /opt/homebrew/bin is not in your PATH.\n  Instructions on how to configure your shell for Homebrew\n  can be found in the 'Next steps' section below.\n\nand below you should see something like:\n==> Next steps:\n- Run these three commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:\n    echo '# Set PATH, MANPATH, etc., for Homebrew.' >> /Users/****/.zprofile\n    echo 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' >> /Users/****/.zprofile\n    eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n\nafter running those commands I could run brew.

Background:\nPurchased 2 12TB WD Gold drives about 2 years ago and have been using them in an external enclosure without problem.\nAfter upgrading my Mac mini server to 11.4, the message \"The disk you attached is not readable\" was displayed for this one drive post-boot. All other attached drives are fine, including it's twin 12TB drive. The message follows the bad drive to other Macs.\nBoth 12TB drives are encrypted and APFS. They're simply used for storage, so they've never been partitioned or set up for booting.\nSince I have a twin drive (note: not a RAID pair, just an identical physical drive), I've compared them side by side, and the main issue that I've found so far is that it appears that the PMBR in sector 0 has been corrupted somehow.\nHere's output from gpt for the bad drive:\nNew-iMac:~ user$ sudo gpt -vv -r show /dev/disk2\nPassword:\ngpt show: /dev/disk2: mediasize=12000138625024; sectorsize=512; blocks=23437770752\ngpt show: /dev/disk2: MBR not found at sector 0\ngpt show: /dev/disk2: Pri GPT at sector 1\ngpt show: /dev/disk2: Sec GPT at sector 23437770751\n        start         size  index  contents\n            0            1         \n            1            1         Pri GPT header\n            2           32         Pri GPT table\n           34            6         \n           40       409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n       409640  23437098928      2  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  23437508568       262151         \n  23437770719           32         Sec GPT table\n  23437770751            1         Sec GPT header\n\nThe good, twin drive:\niMac:~ user$ sudo gpt -vv -r show /dev/disk5\nPassword:\ngpt show: /dev/disk5: mediasize=12000138625024; sectorsize=512; blocks=23437770752\ngpt show: /dev/disk5: PMBR at sector 0\ngpt show: /dev/disk5: Pri GPT at sector 1\ngpt show: /dev/disk5: Sec GPT at sector 23437770751\n        start         size  index  contents\n            0            1         PMBR\n            1            1         Pri GPT header\n            2           32         Pri GPT table\n           34            6         \n           40       409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n       409640  23437098928      2  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  23437508568       262151         \n  23437770719           32         Sec GPT table\n  23437770751            1         Sec GPT header\n\nWhen I look at sector 0 on the good drive, I see what appear to be good/reasonable values when using iBored (old time Mac disk too which can read disk sectors, and show values for MBR partition table).\n\nWhen I look at sector 0 on the bad drive, it (sector 0 only) is zeroed out completely.\nAll of the remaining sectors appear to be present (some other corruption notwithstanding). That is, data exists where I would expect it to exist and zeros exist where I expect zeros to exist. You can see that besides sector 0, gpt generates the exact same output that the good disk does.\nMy intuition - which I freely admit could be completely wrong - is that I may be able to edit sector 0 on the bad drive to match the values found on the good drive and then be able to at least try to mount the drive at that point.\nHowever, I haven't done anything yet other than looking. TIA for any help!\n\nA: Editing sector 0 (the PMBR) of the bad drive to fix the corruption fixed the issue, at least for now. I can see/open/edit all files so far.\nThere's still a chance of hw failure, even though the disk passes all firmware checks and \"disk repair\" completes successfully.\nI was lucky to have an identical disk which had been treated in an identical manner so I could use those values in the first sector.\nBelieve this may have been precipitated by a few power outages that hit this server in the weeks preceding the failure, but that's just a guess.\n", "Q: macOS Calendar default not available I am using the Apple Calendar app on Big Sur (11.4).

I am trying to install node to use with reactjs.

First, go into System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\nWhat you want to do here is assign a shortcut to what Chrome currently does with that key combination. This does depend on Chrome revealing the shortcut in a menu though. And as I don't have Chrome installed I can't confirm this.

Does any Apple or other Bluetooth device support lossless audio, such as ALAC?\nThis is a generalized question for people asking about their specific piece of hardware over Bluetooth. Its purpose is to close them as duplicates.\n\nA: No.\nFor an authoritative answer, please see About lossless audio in Apple Music.\n\nWhile the difference between AAC and lossless audio is virtually indistinguishable, we’re offering Apple Music subscribers the option to access music in lossless audio compression.\n\n\nAirPods, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and Beats wireless headphones use Apple AAC Bluetooth Codec to ensure excellent audio quality. However, Bluetooth connections aren't lossless.\n\nHowever\nThe lossy compressed files on Apple Music will not be transcoded to an Apple audio device, and will be sent bit-for-bit.1 The quality of AAC files on Apple Music are nearly transparent to lossless files when comparing with headsets in the price range of Bluetooth Apple audio devices. Even so, the sound of these AAC files is likely limited by the listening device.\nConsiderations\nIf you only have AAC endpoints, this may have implications on which streaming providers can offer you the best sound quality for your hardware.\n\nCorrection:2 The following Spotify example no longer true. It was likely inaccurate at the time of this post, as the service seems to have switched to solely using AAC profiles a few months before this was written.\n\nFor instance, prior to 2021 Spotify would only stream AAC through a web browser. For its apps will select some bitrate of the Vorbis codec, a free and open-source alternative from the Xiph.Org Foundation, packaged in an Ogg container, that will result in transcoding when using Apple hardware, which only supports AAC and SBC.\nAs their \"Standard\" output selection, TIDAL offers the highest bitrate allowed on AAC: 320 kbps, which is about 20% more than Apple Music's 256 kbps.\nStill depending on how well you can hear, none of this may matter to you, so take advantage of the free trials to compare your listening experience. If they all sound the same to you (and your family), perceived sound quality may not be as big of a factor as say going with the best deal for you (and-or your family).\n\nNon-Authoritative Reference\nWhat You Really Need to Know About Bluetooth Audio, by Brent Butterworth, Published July 15, 2020, Quote:\n\nMany people believe that transmitting an audio signal via Bluetooth\nwill always degrade sound quality, but that’s not necessarily true. If\nan audio signal is already compressed in a certain codec, and the\nsource device (such as your phone, tablet, or computer) and the “sink”\ndevice (such as a wireless speaker or headphones) both support that\ncodec, Bluetooth transmits the encoded audio unaltered, so the sound\nis the same as you’d get without Bluetooth. The most common example is\nwith Apple Music, which uses AAC, and iPhones, which support AAC. If\nyou use these two things along with a wireless speaker or headphones\nthat also support AAC, Bluetooth will not impact the sound quality. If\nat least one of the devices doesn’t support AAC, the AAC data is\ndecompressed and then recompressed with another codec, such as SBC.\nThis process can reduce sound quality, although the difference will\nprobably be subtle.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*\n\n*i lost the link. this is not the correct footnote: About lossless audio in Apple Music\n\n\n*Even though I use the New York Times's authority to backup my claims, I should point out corrections are something they almost never do.\n", "Q: Forgot MacBook password but recovery mode didn’t work So I just got my laptop back ate a year away from the office and forgot my pw.\nLuckily there is easy advice online about power + cmd + R to get into recovery mode.\nTrouble is from there I get stuck— the advice is\n\nGo to the Apple Menu at the top and click Utilities\n\nBut as you can see in the screen shot, there is no Apple many at the top with option UTILITIES — only “restart | shut down”.\nI must be doing something wrong!\nYes I could reset from Apple ID, but it spent stay connected to my internet, probably because it’s a new network here\n\n\nA: Is this a company owned laptop or your personal laptop? If its company owned its likely company managed and your help desk should be able to provide the recovery code to reset the password on the account.\nIf it's a personally owned laptop you can reset either using your Apple ID or obtain the recovery code from iCloud.\nYou may have to click \"Forgot all passwords\".\nThe disk must be encrypted with FileVault2 and it is likely a T2 based Mac.  Therefore you need to login with a local administrator account in order to get into Recovery Mode.  It's asking you for an account with administrative privileges.\nReboot normally and try to get it to ask about your Apple ID and then it will use your iCloud stored recovery key to reset your password.  But again, if it's managed by your IT administrators if the Mac is owned by your employer then you have to call them to reset the password, provide the recovery code.\n", "Q: Trying to identify why com.apple.Safari.Safebrowsing.Service has network traffic, despite not using Safari Just noticed it today, and I got very curious, as I don't use Safari as a browser. I am aware that safebrowsing is a locally queried list, and that it does get updated. However, given that google are the ones that maintain it, Chrome wouldn't do so through safari, so I can't understand why I would have seen this traffic. Only thing I was really able to identify was using sudo lsof -i to get the following address: gbmnc1-vip-bx-003.aaplimg.com, and for some reason it has written 124.3MB to disk, but that's about it.\nI can't find anything in the console logs that would indicate why this is occurring, and I am not sure what terminal commands to run.

However, today it doesn't seem to be. Why would Google Chrome randomly need to use that component?\n\nA: Seems that Chrome uses com.apple.safariservices if you do certain things, like upload a file. From here, related processes to it seem to run, like com.apple.safari.safebrowsing.service, which then seems to have some automated tasks to run.\n\nA: Let disable that service.\nIt runs in background and check for new data interval, so if there are update then it download and write to disk.

I know also that installer packages are really a XAR archive.\nWhat I do not know yet, is that whether running a .pkg installer packages guarantees that all the files produced as a result of running it will be tracked?\nFor instance, when a .pkg installer package ran some arbitrary scripts, will the files be tracked by macOS?  I tried searching and there does not seems to be any official documentation on this.\nSome unofficial guides:\nhttps://matthew-brett.github.io/docosx/flat_packages.html\nhttp://s.sudre.free.fr/Stuff/Ivanhoe/FLAT.html\nAlthough not explicitly mentioned, these guides seems to be indicating that the files won't be tracked, is this correct?\nAlso, are there any official answer on this?\n\nA: There is no official answer, because it is not a feature offered by macOS's Installer. Most packages are digitally signed; if problems are found, the signing organisation can be contacted and held responsible.\nInstaller\nFiles created or modified by scripts within a package are not tracked. macOS's installer does not record or monitor the true impact of the package on the destination.\nYou may be looking for a File Alteration Monitor.\nFSEvents and kqueue\nFor macOS computer wide file system change notifications, see FSEvents.\nmacOS's built-in fs_usage reports system calls and page faults related to filesystem activity in real-time:\n sudo fs_usage -f filesys\n\nSee 10.4: Monitor file system events in real time:\n\nOS X 10.4 has a private API that's used by Spotlight to monitor file system events such as file creation, renaming, and permission changes. Several command line and GUI tools are now available that can suscribe to the event notification system and provide a log of the events. These are useful for, e.g., monitoring files created by installers, and so forth.\n\nFSEvents on macOS are implemented using BSD's kqueue:\n\nKqueue not only handles file descriptor events but is also used for various other notifications such as file modification monitoring, signals, asynchronous I/O events (AIO), child process state change monitoring, and timers which support nanosecond resolution, furthermore kqueue provides a way to use user-defined events in addition to the ones provided by the kernel.\n\n\nA: The issue is what do you mean by track.\nAt the file system level macOS does track any file changes however this is not saved for all time. Files directly installed by the installer will have metadata set on them saying which package installed them in. You can also use pkgutil to see what files the package says it will install. As in the other answer you can run installer ti install the package and it will log these chnages.\nHowever if the installer runs a script or executable that creates files then  the last few methods will not pick this up.\nThere is an API that can see all the file changes https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/UsingtheFSEventsFramework/UsingtheFSEventsFramework.html. (yes it is in archive but Apple's new documantation does not have overviews and I think is still up to date). Thus you can write an application to see what files the installer changes.\nI have not used this API or used any tool to view the events.\nBut I think you always need to register watching before you run the installer. There do exist many language libraries with example simple apps e.g. python and also full applications that use this API and provide a user GUI to see the changes.\nThis webpage suggest you can see then using Finder.\nI think Instruments.app in Xcode can also do this\nThe stand alone application examples I found or was pointed to are paid applications are https://fsmonitor.com/ and  https://rixstep.com/4/0/tracker/\n", "Q: How to disable mDNS correctly?

I've tried a bunch of things already and a quick check by the Apple support desk didn't show any problems so I hope someone else had te same issue.\nI've tried:\n\n*\n\n*SMC reset\n\n*Reset my entire laptop back to factory settings & reinstalled MacOS Big Sur\n\n*Checked with another charger\n\n*Battery health is 'good'\n\n*Turned off optimise battery life\n\nI'm in the middle of finals so hopefully I can find a solution!\nThanks :)\n\nA: Has the cable between the laptop and charger been damaged or changed?  This sounds like the charger is not seeing a USB-PD cable and so only provides 12 watts of power.  If there is a loss of communication for USB-PD negotiation then it might fall back to a simple low power USB-BC mode like iPods would use.  12 watts will charge a laptop while asleep or off but might not keep up with power draw while the laptop is on.\nThe cable that came with the laptop will most likely be a cable capable of USB 2.0 and 20 volts @ 5 amps of USB-PD power.  If you have a different USB-C cable around, or a classmate willing to loan you a cable, then try that.  A common USB-C cable for a hard drive or cell phone should be capable of 20 volts @ 3 amps, far better than 12 watts, more than enough to keep up with most computing loads, though not the full 85 or 96 watts of some power supplies.\nIf you don't have access to a spare then it would not cost too much to buy one from the school book store, a cell phone shop, a big box department or electronic store, or even a grocery store or truck stop.  A quality third party 1 meter cable can be about $8, a genuine 2 meter Apple cable about $20.  If a new cable solves the problem then you solved the problem.  If not then return the borrowed cable, maybe keep the one you bought just in case, and then consider a more expensive problem.\nHas the power supply been damaged?  Borrow or buy a spare to test that.  As I rule I immediately buy a spare charger for my laptops and other important tools.  Not an issue lately for laptops since everyone moved to USB-C but still a rule I follow generally.  I mention this as a means to avoid a problem like this in the future, having a working laptop but a non-working or questionable charger.  It may be a wise investment to keep a spare charger in case of a lost or damaged charger in the future.\n\nA: Three likely reasons.  You cold have any or all of them happening\n\n*\n\n*You likely have apps / services running in the background, which are consuming significant energy.  Only when they are put to sleep/low can the battery build a charge.\n\n\n*If these don't show up in the Activity Monitor under Energy, then the services may be a virus or malware, like a secret crypto miner.\n\n\n*Or your batter is near-dead.  Which is just a special case of the above.\nI had this happen to me, as #1, with a number of file/data sync services.  One would hang bhedin the others, and spin out of control.\n", "Q: Romaji keyboard in Big Sur I'm learning some Japanese on Duolingo and I feel like I could really benefit from actually typing out answers rather than picking them from a list.  From what I gather around the internet (not an expert) the best way to do this is to use romaji to write out the English-phonetic version of what I'm trying to say, and then use Live Conversion to change it to kana (not entirely sure I'm even using all the right words here).\nAnyway, at this point I've activated the Japanese input source for romaji and can't seem to get the Live Conversion to do anything at all:\n\nUsing the on-screen keyboard doesn't seem to change anything.\nAm I missing a step?  Is this even the intended use of romaji input?\nI can't find a tutorial that uses Big Sur so I'm already sort of slanting my way into this, but push comes to shove it feels like something isn't working.\n\nA: Romaji input is for typing Latin letters without any conversion.\nNormally to input Japanese you use Hiragana input, where you type Latin letters that are converted right away to Hiragana Kana and then you hit the space bar to convert to Kanji.  Live Conversion converts to Kanji right away.\nI don't think Apple's IM offers a way to type Latin, keep that on the screen, and then convert to Japanese, if that is what you want.  An alternative IM is here.\n", "Q: Apple Mail OAuth client_id for GSuite IMAP restriction We need to restrict IMAP access to GSuite so that only OAuth supporting apps can use it.

I have a new M1 MacBook Air that I would like to use for Virtual Machine development.\nCan Oracle VirtualBox VMs run on this new Apple Silicon architecture?\nThe documentation on the VirtualBox website states:\n\nIn order to run VirtualBox on your machine, you need:\n\n*\n\n*Reasonably powerful x86 hardware. Any recent Intel or AMD processor should do.\n\n\nBut it's unclear if that documentation is current, or if there are any future plans to support the Apple Silicon ARM architecture. I have not been able to find a VirtualBox blog post or news update that states that M1 chips will or won't be supported.\n\nA: One issue you have is that VirtualBox does not run on non Intel architectures.\nFrom https://www.virtualbox.org/\n\nVirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64  virtualization product\n\nTo run a virtual machine on Apple Silicon currently\nParallels, UTM and Docker support Linux ARM VMs.\nParallels and UTM also support other OSs that run on ARM including Windows, Parallels 17 can run macOS Monterey\nVMware has now (Sept 2021) announced a preview version for ARM that does not officially support Windows or macOS. And on July 28th 2022 VMWare released a tech preview that says it supports Windows 11 and says they are looking into support for macOS.\nVirtualBox does seem now Oct 2022 to be working on a macOS ARM version but as Ars Technica says\n\nI can report that the VirtualBox client informs you, extensively and consistently, about the non-production nature of your client. The changelog notes that it's an \"unsupported work in progress\" that is \"known to have very modest performance.\" A \"Beta Warning\" shows up in the (new and unified) message center, and in the upper-right corner, a \"BETA\" warning on the window frame is stacked on top of a construction-style \"Dev Preview\" warning sign.\n\nThe other thing to note is that if the VM you want to run is an Intel one then  you need an emulator like Qemu.\nYou probably can't just load an Intel VM to run natively as ARM so have to rebuild the VM from an ARM based install.\nDocker can run Intel VMs on Apple Silicon from their blog as can UTM, both use QEMU as a part of implementing this.\nAs UTM includes QEMU UTM can run Intel Windows or Intel macOS  or  PPC classic macos (and possibly PPC OSX )\nmacOS itself provides an API to allow users to write VMs that can run Linux command line programs or macOS.

In VirtualBox your x86 guest code runs at near full speed directly on the host processor. A CPU simulator is an entirely different animal that runs hundreds of times slower: that's good enough for debugging but totally useless for real work.\nFace facts: if you go down the Apple ARM road you leave x86 behind. Period. That doesn't mean that Parallels and VMWare won't try to sell you stuff, but they won't be running an x86 hypervisor on an ARM, nor will it be any other practical solution for running x86 apps on a Mac.\n\n\nA: The \"Face facts: if you go down the Apple ARM road you leave x86 behind.\"  is nonsense as \"Rosetta 2 enables a Mac with Apple silicon to use apps built for a Mac with an Intel processor.\" - Rosetta 2 dialog box.\nTo grossly oversimplify, Rosetta 2 whole purpose is to allow translation of (not emulation — this is important) x86 calls to something the ARM based M1 can handle.  Sort of like how WINE translates calls for the Windows OS into something either the Mac or Linux OS can understand.\nUsing UTM you can even get Windows XP on an M1 MacBook or M1 Mac emulating Windows 7. (Using UTM) though if you go more recent than that performance gets worse.  Heck, \"Intel to build ARM chips for other companies as part of its new business strategy\" shows that Intel realizes that the x86 might be headed for a decline.\n", "Q: How can I fix underscan/overscan when the slider isn't shown in System Preferences?

But that’s a bit painful.\n\nA: Whoever still in need for a solution\nI used MS Power Automate to fix the issue\n\n*\n\n*Create Meeting in Apple Calendar App\n\n\n\n\n*Trigger Power Automate - I used location \"TEAMS\" as condition to do the magic.\n\n\n... then wait or refresh calendar. The meeting is been replaced and includes the MS Teams link etc. Now you may invite people as desired.\n\nA: The best I currently have is:\n\n*\n\n*Create everything in Calendar App (time, name, description, participants, etc.)\n\n*Go to Teams and edit the meeting - e.g. add space in description.\n\nNot the best, but it's something.\nDid you guys find any better option?\n\n\nA: There is no authentication plug in I’ve seen to generate the new teams invite. You could copy an existing meeting link for a team and copy/paste that when scheduling.\nFor me and people in our organization like you, we recommend using the web app for teams in Firefox or Edge browser to book all teams meetings using the calendar view at https://teams.microsoft.com and let the calendar do it’s thing syncing. You might also want to check out two third party native calendar apps.

It will find other non built-in apps I have installed like Chrome, Slack, and Steam just fine.\nI have tried the following fixes:\n\n*\n\n*Unchecking and checking the /Applications folder from search results in the spotlight settings\n\n*Adding and removing the /Applications folder in the Privacy settings\n\n*Turning indexing off and on using sudo mdutil -i off / and sudo mdutil -i on /\n\n*Running sudo mdutil -Ea /\n\n*The accepted answer from this question. Note that I did not actually reload the plist file as it describes because I got the error Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged and I didn't want to disable SIP to get around it (plus most people seemed to think it wasn't necessary).\n\nNone of them worked. Now what?\n\nA: Well, I figured it out. I did some trial and error using the Privacy tab in Spotlight settings and determined that if I add the /System folder to the list (i.e. tell Spotlight to not index it), then I can't access the built in apps via Spotlight.\nAfter looking at the file system it became obvious why that is. All the built in applications are in the /System/Applications folder, whereas all the ones I installed myself are in the /Applications folder (which was not excluded in the Privacy settings).\nThis started happening after I upgraded to Big Sur so I'm not sure if Apple moved some things around or what, but there you go. Sanity restored.\n\nA: The Terminal app, located at /Applications/Utilities, offers a number of commands specific to Spotlight, including mdutil, a utility for managing the Spotlight index function. The mdutil utility manages the metadata stores used by Spotlight and allows you to turn indexing on or off, erase existing metadata storage files, remove local cache indices of network stores, and a few other useful tasks.\nYou can use the mdutil command to turn off indexing for a specified volume, as shown above for the volume named MacHD.\nTo turn off indexing for a specific volume launch Terminal, and then use the following command:\nsudo mdutil -i off /mountPoint\nwhere mountPoint is the path to the volume. For the startup drive, the path would simply be “/” (without the quotes). For other mounted drives on your Mac, the path would likely be /Volumes/volumeName. As an example, if I wanted to turn Spotlight indexing off for my startup drive, the command would be:\nsudo mdutil -i off /\nIf I wanted to turn indexing off for my Time Machine drive, which is named Backup, the command would be:\nsudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/Backup\nAfter executing the command by pressing enter or return, you may be asked for your administrator password. Enter the password at the prompt, and then hit enter or return.\n\nA: Note that Spotlight (at least on my Monterey 12.3.1) has a separate 'System Preferences' search result option which was not selected.\nWith that selected I could use Cmd-Space to get to Bluetooth preferences using only the keyboard so next time my mouse fails to connect it will be easier to get there to give it a nudge.\n", "Q: How click insert key on mac keyboard for virtualbox windows machine?

I tried virtual windows keyboard but it does not keep the key pressed.\nAny help would be amazing!\n\nA: Is this on a laptop internal keyboard or an external USB or BlueTooth keyboard?  An external USB keyboard should not have this problem.\nI may be mistaken though, I have not used VirtualBox in a while, preferring VMWare products instead.  As I recall you can, and this can be dangerous, use the USB passthrough function on VirtualBox to avoid macOS keymapping and/or VirtualBox keypress filtering.\nThe danger with this is that you can have the virtual machine grab your keyboard and it will be difficult to get it back to the host macOS system.  I would not recommend trying this on the only keyboard connected.  Use a second keyboard.  Maybe even have a third just in case.  If something goes wrong plug in another keyboard and use that to get control back.\nIf you have a USB keyboard you can try on this then just try plugging it in to see if that works, then go to the dangerous step of USB passthrough.  I don't want to over sell it here, it's not terribly difficult to recover, but I don't want to under sell either.  VMWare products prohibit the passthrough of HID devices for this reason, which can be frustrating some times.\nAnother option is to try some kind of remote control software.  There's Microsoft's Remote Desktop.  There's various versions of VNC.  Plenty of others, most of which I recall as being a derivative of those two.\n", "Q: Cloning apps on iOS For some reasons I want to get two similar apps on my iPhone (in fact not similar — different versions).

I haven’t account in developers.apple.com but I really need to “clone” the app\niPhone isn’t jailbroken, and I’m using the website to install apps because the Mac is too old and does not support Xcode version compatible with iOS 14\n\nA: You can do this by changing the bundle ID in the Info.plist (as you have already done) - and then resigning the app using the codesign tool that comes with Xcode. This is the crucial step that makes it possible for the app to pass the integrity test.\nThe easiest way to do that is to have a developer account with Apple, but you can also do it a free account. However, you'll have to resign the app every week - otherwise it expires.\n", "Q: zsh: command not found: cask I tried to install Autopsy on my Mac.

I'm looking to buy a new M1 Mac Mini but I'm concerned about the potential issues with its support for ultra-wide displays.\nI know that in a recent version of Mac OS some fixes have been made and now it supports full resolution for ultra-wide displays, in particular 3440x1440.\nMy current monitor is 38\" with 3840x1600 resolution. Is that resolution supported by M1 Macs via HDMI? (when using a high speed cable, of course)\nAnd, most importantly, is it possible to scale up the UI without sacrificing the pixel density? In Windows or Linux it can done by setting the UI scale to 125%.\n\nA: I have the M1 Mac Mini and it works with the Dell U4021QW 5120x2160@60hz. The only downside is the brightness keyboard controls do not work and any utility apps that use DDC/CI do not work because Apple didn't implement DDC/CI in their Apple Silicon ARM kernel.  Perhaps because of an Intel function found in Intel processors.  So other than only being able to adjust the brightness on the monitor itself it's a very nice monitor.\nThe Dell monitor has USB-C Thunderbolt 4 input and that's how I have it connected. It scales nicely.\nHold Option key when clicking Scaled to see the list of optional scaling.\n\n\nA: The stated supported screen resolution on the M1 Mini is:\nUp to 4096 by 2160 pixels at 60Hz (HDMI) Up to 6016 by 3384 pixels at 60 Hz (Thunderbolt).\nRetina Scaling doesn't change the actual pixel density.

I have the binary ready, and I wrote a shell script to call that binary as sudo.\nHowever, the problem is that the shell script isn't able to find the binary, and also it outputs the wrong path with pwd. The location of the binary isn't fixed and it could be placed anywhere, so I cannot hardcode the path into the shell script.\nTo elaborate a little on the pwd outputting wrong path: the script was placed in a location whose path is /Volumes/MySSD/MiscFiles/ and the output of pwd through the shell script was /User/<my client's username>.\nAnother important constraint is that my client cannot operate a terminal, so for him when he double clicks on the executable it starts.

Does anyone know where this fits into Apple's fixed price list for repairs? Do I need to go to a nonapple shop?\nThanks for your help\nSaul\n\nA: It is likely the liquid made it down to the system board and that can not only short out components but causes corrosion that can get worse over time. Corrosion can short circuit as well as cause open circuits.\nThe way to fix it is to dissemble the laptop, clean it and then use schematics and a microscope with very fine soldering tools to find the problem and replace chips, etc. Or you can swap the system board.\nLouis Rossman is a board level repair technician who has a YouTube channel where most of the Mac's he fixes are water damaged.  You can see examples of what corrosion does to a system board by watching a few of those videos. I am not suggesting that you follow these videos and fix it yourself. But Louis shares the videos for educational purposes.\nI would say, just buy a bluetooth keyboard to hold you over till you can get a new Mac.\n\nA: Go to Apple and see if you can get them to replace the keyboard. If you had problems with the keyboard beforehand, you could explain it to them. They might replace it under their Keyboard Service Program. Since there may be water intrusion into the system, they may charge you for the repair, but it's worth a shot:\nhttps://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks\nIf you have no luck with Apple or they charge you an insane price for the repair, then you can have someone repair it or repair it yourself.\nReplacing only the keyboard alone can be costly and isn't worth it. The keyboard isn't serviceable like other laptop keyboards. The keyboard is riveted in place and must be broken off the case to remove it. Installing a new one requires replacing rivets with screws. It's really not worth the effort and the labor will be costly.\nA much easier option is to replace the entire \"palm rest\" or \"top case.\" You'll have to transfer your current working parts over to it.

I use to cancel them but got tired of seeing them pop up when I connect my phone so I just update. Coincidentally I just got one yesterday and updated. I can never tell what the update does - iTunes seems the same and so does everything else.  If I choose to not update, my syncing and everything else still seems to function.\n", "Q: Is there a way to know why cloudd is connecting a site? I see cloudd connecting to multiple Apple sites, which I know little about, but they are apple.com or icloud.com sites, which seems reasonable:\n\n*\n\n*metrics.icloud.com\n\n*gateway.icloud.com\n\n*us-east-1.blobstore.apple.com\n\nToday cloudd wanted permission to connect to us-east-1.amazonaws.com and Little Snitch put up a dialog box. Looking cloudd there were also these two:\n\n*\n\n*usync.icloud-content.com\n\n*edge-068.usbos.icloud-content.com\n\nApple owns the domain icloud-content.com, so I am guessing these are OK.\nThe Amazon connection is less obvious.\nIs there a way to know why cloudd is connecting to specific sites?\n\nA: Little Snitch should already be aware of all Apple domains & be configured by default to allow them. Apple owns all of 17.x.x.x, of which icloud-content.com is a member.\nMake sure you have these rule groups on.\n\nApple processes will also often need access to AWS & Akamai, who are CDNs [Content Delivery Networks] used by Apple & a myriad other companies. Trying to figure out why any of these connections may need to be made is a pointless exercise. You only need to trust the service doing the access, which is an Apple-only daemon.\n", "Q: Steps to perform after power cut to mac If the power is interrupted to mac, what steps, if any, should be performed, even if startup appears fine.\nSuch as entering recovery mode, running First Aid Disk Utility?\n\nA: As far as I know nothing.\nJournaled file systems do not usually lose data when they are shut down unexpectedly, the journal maintains the consistency of the filesystem.  Data that was being written right at the power loss may be gone. The actual file data does also depend on how the app writes data back, if it updates a file in place then the update might not be complete and so you have an incorrect file which you will have to check manually, if the app uses a safe save mechanism ie write to a temporary file and then move that to your file then that should be consistent but might be an older version. So you will need to check at the app level. Some apps will be able to recover better than others. For others you will have to look at backups.\nI think disks are the only part of the system that have different behaviour between and expected shutdown e.g. by /sbin/shutdown or one by power loss,\nUnjournaled file systems can lose data much more easily and that is why you should check the filesystem, the main example of this is filesystems using a form of MSDOS FAT or old Unix filesystems. Nowadays you should onlyu see these on Flash drives or other drives used for moving data between systems and devices.\n", "Q: Safari Inspect elements on mobile device I recently upgraded to latest Safari 14.1.1 and the device inspector dev tools have stopped working. When selecting a target through the Develop menu, the inspector window pops up but is unusable and many of the inspector tabs are disabled. The device I'm inspecting is running latest iOS. Is there some additional security setting I need to enable?\nhttps://webkit.org/web-inspector/enabling-web-inspector/\n\nA: This is a bug that affects everyone as far as I’m aware.

This week some newspaper articles were published in Brazil regarding burglars that are stealing cell phones looking not to resell them or disassemble for parts, but rather to steal money from banking apps. An example is this one (in Portuguese, but perfectly readable using Google Translate.) In a Brazilian Apple forum, there are quite a few first-party reports of this in this thread.\nI've been unable to find any specifics on the methods used by these burglars to unlock the stolen iPhones. It bears mentioning that victims mentioned in the links above confirmed they didn't reveal their passcodes, since otherwise the problem would be much easier.\nHow likely is it that criminal can get access to apps inside a locked iPhone without knowing the passcode (e.g. by misusing account recovery? And what risk mitigation strategies could be used to protect against these attacks without excessively impacting the phone's usability?\n\nA: \nI'm looking for techniques I can apply to my phone to mitigate any risk of my bank accounts getting wiped if my phone is stolen.\n\nI'll restrict my answer to this, anything further would in my opinion be speculation.\n\nRemove FaceID from all banking apps, and use a different password than the iPhone passcode. Even if they somehow figure out the passcode for the iPhone, they can't use that information to access my bank accounts.\n\nThat would be my first action. Disable any biometrics and use individual, strong passwords for each of your financial apps.\nNot using any financial apps on your device at all would be more secure than using them.\nAdditionally, you could ensure that any account recovery methods are not using accounts or phone numbers that are attached to your device.\n\nUnfortunately some \"digital wallet\" apps (similar to e.g. Paypal) protect transaction with either FaceID or the iPhone passcode\n\nYour options are: log out after use, enable 2 factor authentication (also password protected, and not attached to the phone number of the device), or do not use these apps.\n", "Q: Why multiple macOS installation share settings? This question has materialized after this strange interaction: multiple instances of macOS, installed on different hard drives on the same machine, share settings.\nExample: I have this MBR 16”, 2020. On the internal hard drive I was running Catalina. Let’s call that (A).\nOn an external SSD I had installed another copy of Catalina. We will call this (B).\nWhile using (B), When adding folders in the “do not search” setting for Spotlight, whatever folders I would add would be added in the “do not search” list of (A).\nWhen connecting to a certain WiFi only on (B), the WiFi info was added to (A) as well, including password.\nUnless unmounting the internal drive or encrypting both of them, they would communicate for some reason when you would expect two separate entities of macOS on two different drives to not share configuration files.\nWhy does this happen?\nLE: Corrected Spotify into Spotlight\n\nA: Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi passwords are stored in NVRAM/PRAM if you have ever used Wi-Fi in Recovery mode or for an installation. So both macOS installations can use that.\nThe output from the Terminal command nvram preferred-networks will include the names of WiFi networks - the passwords are encrypted.\nSpotlight: Spotlight indexes and settings are specific to the disk volume. These are stored in the .Spotlight-V100 hidden folder. So preventing Spotlight from searching particular locations is an attribute of the volume and so would be used by both installations.\n", "Q: Is there a way to change emoji colors on MacOS? So let's say I want to type emojis in a different color then yellow on MacOS. Is there any way to do it?\nJust for clarification, I'm using the Press Fn key to Show Emoji & Symbols in the keyboard options since I think it's the most convenient.\n\nA: Click and hold the emoji to choose a different emoji colour.\n\nList of emojis that support skin tones on Emojipedia.\n", "Q: Are emoji color preferences stored somewhere on MacOS? So I want to programmatically detect which color I used last for an emoji, e. g. if I used the  emoji with the darkest skin tone () last, is there a place where that information is stored?\n\nA: Ascertaining the last color used of a changeable emojis.\n\nTesting under macOS Catalina, when one makes changes within Emoji & Symbols, at least some of these changes are written to:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.EmojiPreferences.plist\n\nIn Terminal, run:\ndefaults read com.apple.EmojiPreferences\n\nThen look at the output under EMFSkinToneBaseKeyPreferences, and for the emojis you've shown, it will most likely look like e.g.:\n\"\\\\Ud83d\\\\Udc4c\" = \"\\\\Ud83d\\\\Udc4c\\\\Ud83c\\\\Udfff\";\n\nWhile the defaults command is the normal one used with .plist files, nonetheless there is also /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy, and it may be easier in some cases than defaults when trying to retries nested keys.\nIn this particular use case if gives a visual representation of the emojis color change:\nIn Terminal:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \\\n\"Print :EMFDefaultsKey:EMFSkinToneBaseKeyPreferences\" \\\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.EmojiPreferences.plist \nDict {\n     = \n} \n\nThe default color of the emojis shows on the left of the equal sign and the last used color shows on the right.\nOnly changeable emoji that have been previously set from the default color will show, as well as any reset on a given changeable emojis.\nAs I know you use AppleScript, here is a programmatic solution to retrieving and displaying then information from the EMFSkinToneBaseKeyPreferences key:\nExample AppleScript code:\nset shellCMD to {¬\n    \"/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \", ¬\n    \"'Print :EMFDefaultsKey:EMFSkinToneBaseKeyPreferences' \", ¬\n    \"~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.EmojiPreferences.plist \", ¬\n    \"| awk '/=/{sub(/^    /, \\\"\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\", $0);

How would I write an AppleScript that deletes all Stickies notes which are currently open?\nOr perhaps, where are the files stored?\nI tried using Automator, but it doesn't work very well to locate elements on a wide screen.\n\nA: The Stickies application does not contain an AppleScript dictionary, e.g. Stickies.sdef file and as such is not considered directly AppleScript scriptable using basic vanilla AppleScript, sans a possible few basic commands, i.e., activate, quit, etc.\nThe use of System Events and application process \"Stickies\", and also using UI Scripting can perform some events when trying to talk directly to application \"Stickies\" will not work.\nLooking under macOS Catalina the Stickies application appears to store its unsaved notes in:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/Stickies\n\nThey are Rich Text Document Bundles, with the .rtfd file extension.\n\nThe following example AppleScript code will close the Stickies application and permanently delete any unsaved notes:\nif running of application \"Stickies\" then ¬\n    tell application \"Stickies\" to quit\n\nset unsavedStickiesFolder to the POSIX path of ¬\n    ((path to home folder) as string) & ¬\n    \"Library/Containers/com.apple.Stickies/Data/Library/Stickies/\"\n\nset shellCMD to {¬\n    \"/usr/bin/find \", ¬\n    unsavedStickiesFolder, ¬\n    \" -type d -iname '*.rtfd'\"} ¬\n    as string\n\nset unsavedStickies to ¬\n    paragraphs of ¬\n    (do shell script shellCMD)\n\nrepeat with thisFile in unsavedStickies\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        delete item thisFile\nend repeat\n\n\nNotes:\nDo not run the above example AppleScript code unless your unsaved notes are backed up, as they will be permanently deleted!

My intent to is to apply thermal paste, as the Macbook is easily over-heating even when just playing a short YouTube video. I used the same 1.2mm screwdriver to remove a lot of the other screws that are inside the Macbook, but there are just three screws close to the CPU (or I think it's the GPU) unit that are simply just not coming out with my screwdriver.\nI've tried multiple rounds of twirling the screwdriver from different angles and even trying to manually pull out the screw, but to no avail.\nAny input on how to get rid of these three rascal screws would be greatly appreciated, as I also have a 1/3 broken LCD screen, and even plugging in a monitor screen through HDMI creates substantial overheating.\nThanks.\n\nA: Sounds like you have few options left from your description.\nNow you need to drill out the heads using preferably a pillar drill so that you don’t cause any more damage.\nThen, with a bit of luck you can remove the part and then take out the remains of the screws without damaging the threads.\nIf not, then it was an expensive learning experience.

I dropped it into sea water for maybe about 10 seconds yesterday.\nIt appears to work fine when there is power left in the battery. The issue is the charging. If I put in the cord and then restart it, or put in the cord while it is off and then it turn it on, the phone charges (possibly more slowly, but I'm not sure) basically as normal. But if I put in the cord while the phone is already on, it does not show the charging indicator (or if the cord was on from boot, taking it out stops the charging and putting it back in does not resume it).\nWhat could be the issue? I assume it can't be purely hardware because of the relation to booting. Any suggestions on how to get it to charge without needing to boot it afresh each time?\n\nA: you can try the following things in order to see if anything helps.\n\n*\n\n*Restart the device (Don't plug the charger in until the device has turned back on and has been unlocked)\n\n\n*Go to Settings > Touch (or Face ID) & Passcode. Make sure USB Accessories is turned on.\n\n\n*Hold the power and home button at the same time until the Apple logo appears\n\n\n*Connect the phone to a Mac or PC that has iTunes and have it check for issues\n\n\n*Restore your iPhone from an iCloud backup (If you don't have one, just skip this step since your issue is probably not related to this)\nFinally, you can go to Apple's support site and try to get it fixed.

This only happens if it's turned on and laying on my desk.\nAny places for me to look to change this behavior?  I've looked in Apple Music but not sure where to go next.\n\nA: Jabra has an application, Jabra Direct, that gives some control over how the device works.  That app does not give you control over what the buttons do but it does have this setting:\n\nI've changed that to off and all sees to be good, no more Apple Music when I move the headset.\nOf note, there is an unusual part of the installation around a System Extension that's signed by a Jabra employee and not Jabra.

I have the same Jabra Evolve2 65 headset, but I had an older version of Jabra Direct I believe from a previous headset. I'm on a Mac, so I first had to delete that old Jabra Direct because the option to upgrade it continuously failed with the installer it was linking to (https://macuninstallguides.com/remove-jabra-direct-on-mac.html). Then, I downloaded the latest version for Mac here: https://www.jabra.com/software-and-services/jabra-direct\nAfter some firmware upgrades to the headset and dongle I can see the setting above.

of misconfiguration or unexpected error to do with a write to the last-level cache on the CPU.\nBasically this sounds like a concurrency or parallelism error, where two parts of the system are stepping on each other's toes.\nI would assume that this can be fixed by a driver update from Apple, if you're using an Apple Ethernet to Thunderbolt dongle. I would report it in as a bug to Apple, or the actual maker of the Ethernet to Thunderbolt dongle if you're using a third party driver.\n", "Q: Strange Crash Behaviour - Late 2016 MacBook Pro My late 2016 15\" MacBook Pro exhibits a weird crash behavior. It seems to crash at random times roughly every 20 hours of usage. It does so by becoming unresponsive. In particular, usually, the application I am currently using will fail to respond first. When I then try to quit or even force quit the application this Mac OS X function (I'm using Big Sur) will fail too. After that, I can still \"click the buttons\" of the graphical interface of Mac OS X, but there won't be any response from the system (shutting down the laptop does not work either).\nSo far the only solution has been to kill and restart the laptop. This started roughly 3 months ago (and it feels like it's getting worse - though that assessment may be influenced by my subjective judgement). Today I got a bluescreen for the first time (after the laptop stopped to respond, but before I killed it).\nIn response to the problem, I uninstalled all applications that were installed shortly before and after this behavior first occurred. Furthermore, I've always been using Avira so I don't think a virus is the culprit either.\nHow would you recommend I go about resolving this issue? Any help is greatly appreciated.\nEDIT: This is what the Memory Usage usually looks like: \n\nA: Can you tell if the Finder is crashing? By holding down mouse on the Finder icon on the Dock. It will show Relaunch Finder if it is crashing. If it is or not, the next thing I would do is boot into Recovery mode and run Disk Utility and repair the hard drive by using First Aid. Reboot normally. If this does fix the problem, you can boot into Recovery again and Install macOS. This will re-install the macOS. It will not affect data. It may reset the Dock settings and some System settings as well.\n", "Q: Why are there so many valid users on macOS? When going through Activity Monitor, I see many different users (other than my own account and the root account) responsible for individual processes. Why are the processes divided among many users that are created by the operating system? Why are they not simply divided amongst the root account and the user account currently in use?\n\n\nA: This is the principle of least privilege.\n\nThe principle means giving a user account or process only those privileges which are essential to perform its intended function. For example, a user account for the sole purpose of creating backups does not need to install software: hence, it has rights only to run backup and backup-related applications. Any other privileges, such as installing new software, are blocked.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege\n\nMany daemons only need access to a specific hardware device or to specific files, so they run under a dedicated user account. This is done for security: that way, even if there's a bug or misconfiguration in one of these services, it can't lead to a full system attack, because the attacker will be limited to what this service can do and won't be able to overwrite files, spy on processes, etc.\n\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/a/197155/45383\n", "Q: Make Microsoft Teams Focus on the Proper Window Is there a way to make ⌘-tab switching to Microsoft Teams actually focus on the app? There's a hidden/ invisible window called \"Microsoft Teams Notification\" that is always the default selection when I tab back, which means the actual app I want to use is still buried under other stuff. Ideally I would be able to swap to the right window and be brought into the chat box, but at this point I will settle for just the first part.\nI've tried writing Apple Script to force the issue, but it looks like Teams does not provide hooks for Apple Script.\n\n\nA: This has been an issue forever. Microsoft doesn’t care.\nA potential workaround that sometimes solves the problem is the ability to replace the silly tiny badly-programmed Chrome window notifications that should never have existed with real macOS notifications.\nNative notification functionality is in the developer preview of Teams and can be enabled from notification settings. It’s been in development for 5 years and only available in developer preview for 1.5 years, so don’t hold much hope for it coming to the normal build soon.\nAlso, I say only sometimes because there’s still lots of cases where the main Teams window doesn’t activate even when it’s the only window in the list of windows, such as if it’s in a full screen space on a secondary display. There’s no workaround for this — again Microsoft need to fix this.\n", "Q: MacBook Air M1: Noticeable desktop swiping lag Mac: MacBook Air (M1,2020)\nOS: macOS Big Sur (11.4)\nAge: ~6-7 months\nI'm facing a problem where there seems to be a slight lag when I 4-finger swipe between windows/desktops. It's like a second long & is noticeable. Doesn't happen on multiple swipes.\nI noticed this a few weeks ago and closed a few apps-didn't help. So, I shut it down and turned it on again which helped and the lag's gone. I don't shut down my Mac often (mostly just put it to sleep by pressing the power button and esc key).\nIt reappeared again for the last few days so I shut it down and it's gone. Works instantaneously.\nProblem kept reappearing so I updated my Mac to 11.4 but it still occurs after not being shut-down for a while.\nSince the problem usually appears after putting the Mac to sleep, I don't think it has to do with the trackpad or any hardware functionality in particular.\n[There's also infrequent problems of Safari reloading at times saying websites are very heavy. Once an app or two crashed on me but I didn't think it was a big problem since I figured it's just apps not optimised for M1 but I thought I'd add this in case it's part of some bigger problem]\n(I'm sure this doesn't happen with MacBooks since it didn't on my previous MacBook Air(2015) & since this is much faster, I definitely didn't expect this kinda problem here.)\n\nA: Probably it's because of some third-party software with access to screen recording.\nTry to close any unused programs and check again.

Somewhat surprisingly, no decent answers came up when I googled this question. And the closest question I can find here is - - and it doesn’t provide an answer: iOS Facebook app stuck in logged in state - how to log that user out?\nPerfect question for SE. As Facebook is likely to continue to make this increasingly difficult.\nI think I may have to login some other way and then kill open sessions or something.  I think I went through all the menu options in the app. It’s not there or I missed it. =>\nYup.\n\nA: placeholder - working on refining this answer to meet SE standards… (I began by posting links that I thought had the essential info … but actually didn’t…)\nUpdate:  WOAH!  This is way more complicated than I thought! Even after finding and reading the  info at the links below.\nFacebook is deceptive.  Even after ending ALL Messenger app sessions, I could still log back in in the app without my password and without 2 factor authentication (which I DO have enabled!)   I would try to use the app and it would let me right in and a new session would appear.  And after killing that session, the above would happen again.  I tried killing ALL sessions, and that did the trick.  At least this once.\nI found info at two facebook.com web pages that I thought provided the answer working on making it a proper answer.\nImportant: Note that at each of these pages, there is a pull-down that customizes the information for the UI in use (User Interface, I.e. where you are logged in) - Android, iPhone or iPad app, or browser (Basic Mobile, Mobile or Computer).  Be sure to choose carefully and note the differences for the UI or UIs you are using.\nThe two web pages are:\nThe main one:  https://mobile.facebook.com/help/211990645501187/\n(and the second, which links to the main one.\nhttps://mobile.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/719351428125983 )\nThere is no fb page with the answer to this question for the Messenger apps.\nThese DO (sort of) answer, respectively :\n\n*\n\n*How do I log out of Facebook on another computer, phone or tablet? and (astonishingly)\n\n*Can I log out of Messenger?\nFirst, they discourage you by saying, misleadingly, “You can't log out of an account on Messenger” ! Then way, way below, after indroducing 5 distracting, lame suggestions, they say “you can always end an active session from your Facebook app's Security Settings”.  How? It seems they make it different  in each UI, so use the URL above - if it still works, and choose the UI that matches.\nIn essence,\nYou can manage where you’re logged in from your Security and Login Settings. The WHERE YOU'RE LOGGED IN section lists where you’re currently logged in. Each entry includes a date, time, location and device type.\nTo end a session:\n\n*\n\n*Hunt for, or use the URL above to find your way to, Security and Login.\n\n*Go to the section WHERE YOU'RE LOGGED IN.\n\n*YMMV.  You will likely ned to ignore their misleading/false claim that “Tapping Log Out will immediately log you off of Facebook on that computer, phone or tablet.\"  Kill all sessions.\n\n", "Q: How can I check to see if my laptop is being\"managed\" I need help.  Files are being deleted from my laptop w/o my consent; I just discovered that my personal laptop is being \"managed\" - can someone help me find out how to put an end to this??  THanks.\n\nA: Mobile device management\nThis is the most common form of device management. Check in System Preferences → Profiles. If there is no Profiles button, there are no profiles installed and this option is not in use. If there are profiles present, check the details of the profiles for their capabilities.\nRemote management\nA precursor to MDM, this is activated in a separate location: System Preferences → Sharing. Remote Management is one of the options and can be deactivated, along with other forms of remote connectivity to various parts of macOS.\nOther software\nPlenty of other software can be installed on macOS and provide remote access.

Currently, playing a 4K video on YouTube is a bit slow.\nI'm using macOS High Sierra on 13-inch 2017 MacBook Pro with 3.1 GHz Intel Core i5 and Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 1536 MB.\n\nA: For AV1, no. The only dedicated hardware decoding for AV1 is in NVIDIA's latest GPUs, the 3000 series, Intel's 11th gen chips, and AMD's RDNA2 GPUs.\nAccording to this discussion, VP9 hardware decoding is available.

I have a 2021 MBP with a 500 Gb hard drive. In Disk Utility I am seeing the following entries:\n\n\n\nIs this normal? Why is the same disk mounted in different locations, / and /System/Volumes/Data? And what is the unmounted disk?\n\nA: This is normal. The Macintosh HD volume contains files that do not need to change when macOS is executing, except during operations such as updates. This is what you selected in the first image. To prevent any changes from taking effect while macOS is normally executing, a snapshot is taken of the Macintosh HD volume. This is shown in the second image. Note, that the snapshot of the Macintosh HD volume is mounted instead of the current contents of the volume. The Macintosh HD - Data volume contains files that can change when macOS is executing. This is shown in the third image. All three volumes belong to the same APFS Volume Group. So while the Macintosh HD - Data volume is mount at /System/Volumes/Data, the volume also shares the / mount point with the snapshot of the Macintosh HD volume.\nAll of this seeming nonsense has to do with protecting data. You can read the following Apple documentation for more information.\nProtecting data at multiple layers\nWhat is a signed system volume?\nI should also point out your Mac has an internal Solid State Drive (SSD) and not a Hard Disk Drive (HDD). Also this drive has hidden EFI, Preboot, Recovery and VM (Virtual Memory) volumes.\n", "Q: Neither .bashrc nor .profile gets read when bash is set as the shell in macOS 11 I know macOS 11 is trying hard to convince me to use zsh, but it also says I can choose another shell, which I have: chsh -s /bin/bash.

When I am editing a Word document, which contains images, I need to break a paragraph, so that the image stays at the top of the page, instead of allowing the intervening image (or table for that matter) being pushed down by the overflowing text. When this happens, I need to break the paragraph at the bottom of a page and then copy and paste the rest of the paragraph into the text after the image. However, when I do this the last line of the broken paragraph does not justify to the right even though I do the recommended command, which is the pressing of command + J. Moreover, solutions given for Word for Windows do not work either, like pressing ctrl + shift + J or Shift + Return. To better illustrate the problem, please check a similar question at the SuperUser site, whose solution does NOT work on Word for Mac. How do I then justify the last line of a broken paragraph in Word for Mac?\n\nA: After trying many sites (including Microsoft's own help page on this subject) and many other suggestions, which none of them worked, I finally found out how you can do this.\n\n*\n\n*Open Microsoft Word (including latest version 16.50)\n\n*Go to Word menu->Preferences\n\n*Click on Ribbon & Toolbar\n\n*Click on the tab Quick Access Toolbar\n\n*Change the popup menu from Popular Commands to All Commands\n\n*Search for the command Distribute Text on the list to the left and select it.\n\n*Click on the button  >  to add it to the Customize Quick Access Toolbar list.

One half-way solution is to go to System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Zoom and Zoom In:\n\nIts not the ideal solution. Apple itself has this much to say on the topic:\n\nMake text bigger on your Mac ·         Increase the text size of\nemails in Mail: In Mail, choose Mail > Preferences, click Fonts &\nColors, click Select next to “Message font,” then select a font size\nin the Fonts window. ·         Increase the text size of messages in\nMessages: In Messages, choose Messages > Preferences, click General,\nthen move the “Text size” slider to the right. ·         Increase the\ntext size in other apps: In many apps, you can press Command-Plus (+)\nor Command-Minus (–) to adjust text size. If that doesn’t work, check\nthe app’s preferences.\n\n\nA: You need to use a native scaling factor. This is the only way for the text to look sharp after changing the resolution.\nIf your resolution is 3440px by 1440px, you need to use 1720px by 720.\n3440/2=1720\n1440/2=720.\nIf you divide your resolution by a fraction instead of an integer the text will look blurry. This is caused by the way system renders the UI. The exact explanation is above my level of understanding.\nIf you don't want to change the resolution, you can use Zoom as suggested by @morpheus, use Hover text or change Font Size and Page Zoom in the Appearance section of Google Chrome's preferences.\n", "Q: After connecting newer Mac Mini to monitor, the resolution is worse I just updated from a 2014 Mac Mini to a 2020 Mac Mini for work.

(Same as the Apple Thunderbolt Display.)\nSo you should be able to achieve that resolution from your Mini. You might want to try USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort, rather than HDMI. (Though it's certainly within the 4096 x 2160 pixel limit of the Mini on HDMI.)\nHowever, it has a pixel density of 109 pixels per inch.

I won't be doing a large amount of DVD authoring, just hobby stuff.\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes, either one can mount disks on the other, but it might be more efficient to save a DVD image onto an external disk, then move the disk to the other machine.\n\nA: I have a 2011 iMac running High Sierra with a builtin SuperDrive. I can access this drive as a Remote Disc from a 2018 Mac mini running Mojave. However, I can not use the Remote Disc to burn DVDs from the 2018 Mac mini using the software included with Mojave. I do not see how installing Roxio Toast Titanium would change this. However, I could be wrong.\nYou could try using Roxio Toast Titanium on the 2017 Macbook Pro, then using the 2009 Macbook to burn, but this might require owning a Roxio Toast Titanium license for each machine. The newest version of Roxio Toast Titanium that will run on a 2009 MacBook is version 18. If the 2017 Macbook Pro is running Big Sur, you may need to install the current version of Roxio Toast Titanium, which is version 19. I do not know if Disc Images saved using version 19 can be accessed and burned using version 18.\nAnother option would be to purchase an external Apple USB SuperDrive and the Apple USB-C to USB Adapter. This will allow you to do everything from the 2017 Macbook Pro. If purchased from Apple, the cost would be 98 USD, however, cheaper optical drives may be found which may not need an adaptor.\n", "Q: How do I access a nested menu item with AppleScript in Photos.app (to open each album in turn, to change sorting)? My end goal is to change all Photos.app albums under a certain folder to \"Keep Sorted By Title\" (View > Sort > Keep Sorted By Title).\nIt doesn't seem possible to directly set the sort order of an album via AppleScript (couldn't find it in the Dictionary, anyway).\nSo I figured I could have AppleScript open each album in turn, then change the sort order.\nFirst step is to open each album in turn, which I thought I could do by clicking them in the View > Albums menu.

I saw someone mention elsewhere they bound a keyboard shortcut to \"Keep Sorted By Title\" and then manually clicked into each event and hit the shortcut. I'm open to that (it's just 600 albums or so) but I'd love to figure out how to do it programmatically via AppleScript instead – or at least to understand how to navigate these menus.\n\nA: Possible AppleScript solution:\nThe example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested in Script Editor under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate setting in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\n\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Photos\"\n    activate\n    set albumNames to name of albums\nend tell\n\nrepeat with thisAlbum in albumNames\n    tell application \"Photos\" to activate\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell application process \"Photos\"\n            tell menu bar item \"View\" of menu bar 1\n                click\n                click menu item \"Albums\" of menu 1\n                click menu item thisAlbum of menu 1 of menu item \"Albums\" of menu 1\n                click\n                click menu item \"Sort\" of menu 1\n                click menu item \"Keep Sorted By Title\" of menu 1 of menu item \"Sort\" of menu 1\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    delay 0.5\nend repeat\n\n\nNotes:\nIn my Photos all of my entries under My Albums are a single level of Albums, so the example AppleScript code worked for me.\nIf you are trying to target Albums within a folder under e.g. \"Hushings 2020\" then:\nChange:\nset albumNames to name of albums\n\nTo, e.g.,:\nset albumNames to name of albums of folder \"Hushings 2020\"\n\nNote that because of the nature of how menu items are displayed in this case, the album names within the folder must be unique to the target folder.\nYou may need to add a delay command in-between the various click events.\nBecause of the kludgy nature of UI Scripting it is prone to issues/errors, and in this particular use case, once started you cannot do anything else on the computer and must allow the script to finish.\nYou could also break down the Albums into multiple lists and cycle thru a smaller number of items at a time, instead of trying to do all 600 at one time.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\n\nAdding a keyboard shortcut for: Keep Sorted By Title\nGo to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts and press the [+] button.\nFor Application: select [Photos].\nFor Menu Title: use Keep Sorted By Title\nFor Keyboard Shortcut: use: ⌥⌘T\nThen click the Add button.\n\nYou can then select one Album at a time and press ⌥⌘T followed by a down arrow and so on.\n", "Q: Difference between wake, poweron, and wakeorpoweron on pmset I'm trying to use pmset to wake my macbook before a cronjob is scheduled.

All I know is that iTunes was installed on this machine at one point, so a working installer must exist. Any help?\nEdit: there is a really obvious statement on the link that I posted above that I somehow missed:\n\"Note: macOS 10.14 Mojave includes iTunes 12.9.x as part of the operating system. There is no standalone installer provided. Updates to iTunes are included in OS updates when applicable. You can reinstall Mojave to repair iTunes.\"\nIs this really the only solution? Is there a way to \"repair\" the OS/install missing components, without reinstalling the entire thing? And if I did do the reinstall, does that reset data and settings configurations, etc.?\n\nA: *\n\n*Download a copy of macOS Mojave (you can get it here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683)\n\n*Download Pacifist from https://www.charlessoft.com/\n\n*Open Pacifist and drag the Mojave installer onto the window\n\n*Once it's done loading, go to OSInstall/Core.pkg/Applications/iTunes\n\n*Click the \"Extract To...\" button at the top of the window. Choose your /Applications folder and complete the steps to install it.\n\nIf you removed other parts of iTunes (so not just iTunes.app) you'll need to reinstall those as well. I'll assume you know what you've removed and can find them.\n", "Q: \"Learn Coding with Minecraft\" API setup problem: \"zsh: exec format error:\" Using the \"Start_Server\" exec file provided in .zip of set up files for MacOS, and after installing Java, BuildTools, & the Spigot jar files, etc., I try to run \"Start_Server\" exec file from the command line using the file path and it gives me this error:\nzsh: exec format error: /Users/[xxxx]/Documents/MinecraftPython/MinecraftToolsMac/Start_Server\n\n[Process completed]\n\nI had to use the terminal to make the \"Start_Server\" file executable, but when I try to run it I get that. Any ideas what to do are appreciated.\nI just want to get my server initiated so I can start coding with Minecraft...\n\nA: Apparently that file got garbled when it was zipped up & made available for download (here's the download source). It's supposed to be an alias to the file Start.command in the Server subdirectory, but the metadata that identifies it as an alias wasn't included so the Finder doesn't know what to do with it.\nThe simplest solution is to just open Server, and double-click on Start.command instead. If you want, you can make a replacement alias in the Finder (select Start.command, then choose File menu > Make Alias or press Command-L), rename the alias to Start_Server, and move it to the outer directory (replacing the broken file).\nIf you want to get fancy, you can reattach the missing metadata in Terminal:\nxattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo '61 6C 69 73 4D 41 43 53 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00' ~/Documents/MinecraftPython/MinecraftToolsMac/Start_Server\n\n(This attaches the type code \"alis\" and the creator code \"MACS\" to the file, which'll identify it as an alias to a file. Aliases to other kinds of objects -- folders, applications, servers, etc -- have different codes.)\nIf you have a way to send feedback to the author/maintainers, you should let them know to fix it. Creating the zip file with the Finder should include the relevant metadata (although I'd actually recommend using a symlink instead of an alias for this).\n", "Q: Screencapture does not include windows I'm trying to take a screenshot of my main screen, but screencapture -x -Jwindow 1.png does not include windows, so a screenshot contains only my wallpaper.\nBasically, I want screencapture to work the same way as command + shift + 3 does.\nEdit: I don't want to allow user to select windows manually using -W\nEdit 2: Big Sur v11.4\n\nA: -J is an interactive mode control, you don't need that.

But now I am not able to see that option.\nNothing substantial has changed in my computer, I don't remember updating anything.\nMy MacBook pro is mid-2015 15 inch and OS is mojave.\nAccording to this answer\n, my MacBook is too old to have that option. But I saw that option after the motherboard change but it is now gone. What kind of non-deterministic behaviour is this?\n\nA: Yes, that feature should not be available on your model of MacBook Pro.\nAs to why you saw it initially, then I can only guess that it was a bug. It's possible that the change in logic board was a factor in confusing the OS.\nBut ultimately, you should not expect or rely on enabling this feature.\nThere are third-party battery management utilities, like Coconut Battery, which provide more in-depth data. But you can't alter the way it charges.

Because an email address IS your AppleID, that is the only way it works.\nFirst go to https://appleid.apple.com/ and sign in with your AppleID username and password which will be your gmail address and whatever password you set.

Sorry I don't have more details after that but I don't want to change my AppleID here ;-)\nOnce that is done you can sign out and continue to use your Apple devices as before, but with a new Apple ID that you just set.\nIt has been a long time since I did any of this so you may have to sign out of your Apple ID on your Mac/iPhone/whatever and then back in with your new AppleID email and password.

Open a new document in Text Edit, paste the name, and see if there is something readable (maybe change font).\n\n\n*It may only appear when connected to a specific network - e.g. home, work, or public wifi.\n\n\n*Turn off or disconnect network devices when it next appears. Turn them back on one by one until it reappears.\n", "Q: Sleep prevented by powerd Recently, my M1 MBA was draining out of battery very quickly.

When macOS starts, you are asked to enter a name and account.  I wonder if this potentially personal data third-party macOS apps can read, especially the user's name or username.\nI'm on macOS Big Sur 11.1.\n\nA: Yes, you can third-party macOS apps that you install on your computer can in general read personally identifiable information.\nYou can add various permissions schemes, sandboxes, etc. in order to limit what information the app can access. However for a typical home user computer, it is really hard to block access to all PII while still having the app work. For example just knowing your external IP address is a piece of PII - apps that communicate with the outside world, and they're many, generally will be able to learn this bit of information.\n\nA: Yes, third party macOS apps can trivially access both your user name and full name.\nA work around to this specific problem might be to create a new user and run the application as that user. However, as mentioned in another answer, developers have more nefarious ways to identify you.\n", "Q: Is there any procedure on macOS systems to manually set a network interface to a self-assigned address?

In order to make my app detect and hopefully solve this issue, I would like to simulate this condition. Is there any expert that could bring me in the right direction ? Thanks a lot for your attention.\n\nA: macOS self assigns an ip if the network adapter is working properly, but it can't communicate with a DHCP Server.\nSo you could connect your Mac to another Computer (with no DHCP Server running) with an Ethernet cable or stop the DHCP-Server on your router from running to get this effect.\n\nNote: If you disable the DHCP Server in your router, make sure to remember the IP and subnet of the router to be able to enable it again.\n\n", "Q: Newly added music not syncing to my iPhone after getting a new Mac (10.14.6 macOS Mojave), but iTunes library is identical I replaced my old Mac Pro 1.1 tower with a newer 5.1 tower (running 10.14.6 macOS Mojave).

What can Applescript see? At the moment, I can control menu bar items and keypresses, which is excellent, but i'd like to to be able to know everything that ApleScript can see inside an app's window.\nget properties returns some good things, but is there anything more powerful?\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Clearview\"\n  get properties of window 1\nend tell\n\ntried this:\ndelay 2\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  tell front window of (first application process whose frontmost is true)\n    set uiElems to entire contents\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nbut it times out for Clearview and even Terminal.\n\nA: AppleScript can see pretty much all the UI elements via System Events, but to get items in a manageable form, instead of just throwing everything into a box, you really should traverse the hierarchy of the desired element(s).  For example, there may be several objects (such as splitter group, scroll area, etc) in an application window, but those can each contain other elements, which can contain other elements....\nThis is one of the reasons that GUI scripting is so problematic.  You need to know the specific hierarchy of the element or control, but that can change based on the application version and the particular layout at any given time, so it is helpful to know how it was found in the first place.\nFor spelunking the UI hierarchy, Xcode includes an Accessibility Inspector application, but it can also be done manually in the Script Editor, where the object references can be viewed in the Log window.  For an example, start with the UI elements of an application window, here the front window in Terminal v2.11 (Big Sur):\ntell application \"System Events\" -- peek into the rabbit hole\n    tell application process \"Terminal\" to tell window 1\n        set elements to its UI elements -- get elements at the current location\n        if elements is {} then -- no more\n            return its value\n        else\n            return elements\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThen if elements are shown in the results, pick one and add it to the tell statement to get its UI elements, and so on, until you get to the control you are interested in.  Continuing from the above example (the ¬ is a line continuation symbol from using option-return (or option-l) to try to keep the formatting reasonable):\ntell application \"System Events\" -- kick the rabbit out\n    tell application process \"Terminal\" to tell window 1 ¬\n        to tell splitter group 1 ¬\n        to tell scroll area 1 ¬\n        to tell text area 1\n        set elements to its UI elements -- get elements at the current location\n        if elements is {} then -- no more\n            return its value\n        else\n            return elements\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe final object reference for the above would be something like text area 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 1 of window 1 of application process \"Terminal\" which can be copied from the Script Editor event window to use or keep around.\n\nA: Accessibility Inspector\nApple publish a graphical tool called Accessibility Inspector. It is designed to explore and test the accessibility values associated with an interface. This is the same information AppleScript uses for Graphical User Interface (GUI) Scripting:\n\nAccessibility Inspector makes it even easier to identify user interface element information. This app is included with Xcode. To use it, open Xcode and select Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Accessibility Inspector.\n\nSee Apple's Automating the User Interface documentation for examples.\n\n\nA: tell application \"System Events\" to return value of every attribute of UI elements of windows of application process (name of first process whose frontmost is true)\n\n", "Q: Running \"homebrew upgrade [specific formulae] upgraded a lot more, why? So I needed to upgrade youtube-dl, and ran brew upgrade youtube-dl. While it was running, homebrew decided it needed to upgrade a lot more stuff, including all of my installed PHP versions... And now, none of them works like they should anymore (error messages in cli, modules not loaded, etc.).\nI'm going to go on and probably reformat my machine to have a clean slate, but I wonder why running brew upgrade while explicitely giving the package to upgrade would update others. I understand dependencies, but I highly doubt that youtube-dl is dependent on PHP 7.4 and PHP 8.0, and others.\nIs there a flag I missed? Anything else?\n\nA: To see the dependency tree of a Homebrew package, use brew deps --tree <package>:\n$ brew deps --tree --include-build youtube-dl\nyoutube-dl\n└── python@3.9\n    ├── pkg-config\n    ├── gdbm\n    ├── mpdecimal\n    ├── openssl@1.1\n    ├── readline\n    ├── sqlite\n    │   └── readline\n    └── xz\n\nyoutube-dl, php and php@7.4 all depend on python@3.9. I could imagine that updating youtube-dl triggered an update of python@3.9 which was incompatible with the installed versions of php/php@7.4, therefore triggering an update of those packages as well.\n\nA: Homebrew FAQ:\n\nWhy does brew upgrade  also upgrade a bunch of other stuff?\nHomebrew doesn’t support arbitrary mixing and matching of formula\nversions, so everything a formula depends on, and everything that\ndepends on it in turn, needs to be upgraded to the latest version as\nthat’s the only combination of formulae we test. As a consequence any\ngiven upgrade or install command can upgrade many other (seemingly\nunrelated) formulae, if something important like python or openssl\nalso needed an upgrade.\nHow do I stop certain formulae from being updated?\nTo stop something from being updated/upgraded:\nbrew pin <formula>\nTo allow that formulae to update again:\nbrew unpin <formula>\nNote that pinned, outdated formulae that another\nformula depends on need to be upgraded when required, as we do not\nallow formulae to be built against outdated versions. If this is not\ndesired, you can instead brew extract to maintain your own copy of the\nformula in a tap.\n\n\nA: Most likely because brew automatically upgraded other packages that use the dependencies of youtube-dl that were upgraded.\nYou can disable that behavior by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK:\nexport HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK=1\n\nYou can show which packages depend on a specific package (these are called dependents):\nbrew uses --recursive --installed python\n\n", "Q: Hardware-independent recovery key similar to Bitlocker? I've been doing a bit of research about FileVault and APFS recently, but it still confuses me. I learned about the two types of recovery keys for FileVault, personal recovery key and institutional recovery key. According to what I read, the personal one only works on the same device (if the Mac is broken, access will be impossible) and the institutional one requires an MDM, a PKI, and needs to be configured before the volume is encrypted.\nIs there any device-independent recovery key that I can export from an unlocked volume and use for unlocking on any device?\nWindows Bitlocker has this function and it is very handy, because in many situation you do not have to mess around with protectors or cryptousers, TPM/T2-chips and similar device-specific mechanisms. One basically exports the AES-key of the drive or something fully equivalent.\nI read about a \"secure token\" but I did not really understand it. Could this be what I am thinking about?\n\nA: Way we manage this at work is we use MDM to enforce and monitor for the presence of a unique key that gets escrowed. Unfortunately, if you support Intel and Apple Silicon Macs and ones with and without the T2 chip and Secure Enclave, there are differences in implementation and levels of harness on macOS that may not translate to someone looking to take their bitlocker knowledge and apply it directly to another platform.\nWe also ensure we have backups with keys we manage so even if a Mac gets wiped or locked, the files themselves are not lost due to a failure to have an admin account or key escrowed for decryption of data. You can avoid this problem entirely if you focus on securing the data and not keys to unlock one copy of the data.\nThe secure token connects a user space key with the private keys that never leave the Secure Enclave on newer hardware. Basically the one grants access to load the other securely. Apple has very dense but also very approachable documentation on this in their platform security papers and website:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web\n\nA: From your question and your tags, I assume we're talking about an internal drive on a modern Mac with a T2 (or newer) running a recent version of macOS.\nI'll answer your question directly: No, there is no device-independent recovery key you can export from an unlocked volume and use for unlocking on any device.\nIf it were possible to export such a key, the act of doing so would lessen the security of the system.\nCould Apple have made it possible to do so anyways? - Certainly.

SSDs are on the way, but will not arrive for a week.\nI found this answer online but can't be sure of its correctness:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3111247?answerId=32268374022#32268374022\nWhat I generally do to re-activate a hard drive that could be stuck on a task. Is the following on terminal:\nps aux | grep fsck\nsudo kill -9 [task number]\nbut this solution does not format or enable journaling. In addition, it limits the result by removing the drive's capability to re-write. Forcing me to apply:\nDisk Utility>First Aid (so far, sometimes it takes a long time, others very long).\nI feel like I'm asking many questions here.\nBut I simply wish to know if erase or restore will enable journaling without losing all your data\n(if Disk Utility can do this from their GUI would be a lifesaver).\nBut I'm willing to learn other solutions in the terminal as to how I found out:\nps aux | grep fsck\n\nA: Erase will erase all data.\nRestore will erase all data and replace it with data from wherever you choose as the source for the restore.\nSo in both cases, you will lose all data on the disk, partition, container or volume. The data will be gone.\nThe only caveat is that depending on the current state of the disk (e.g. encryption) some of the data might be recoverable using 3rd party file recovery software or data recovery service. You don't want to do that!\n\nA: \nI simply wish to know if erase or restore will enable journaling without losing all your data\n\nNo, you will lose all data:\n\n*\n\n*Using Erase on Disk Utility to format a volume will delete all existing data.\n\n\n*Using Restore on Disk Utility will also delete all existing data on a volume, as it copies data from another image of a volume.\n\nThere is a much simpler way to enable Journaling in an existing volume with the macOS Extended or APFS file system. This can be done using Disk Utility or through the Terminal.\nEnable Journaling using Disk Utility\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility from Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility.\n\n\n*From the list of disks on the left-hand side, select the name of the volume on which you wish to enable journaling.\n\n\n*Then click on File > Enable Journaling.\nNote:\n\n*\n\n*It is recommended to run First Aid on the disk before enabling journaling.\n\n*To enable / disable journaling on a boot disk (Macintosh HD), you have to run Disk Utility through Recovery or from another installation disk.\n\nEnable Journaling using Terminal\n\n*\n\n*Login to macOS as an admin user.\n\n*Open Terminal from Applications > Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*Type the following command: sudo diskutil enableJournal /dev/diskXsY and press the return key.\n\nNote: In /dev/diskXsY, 'X' is the disk number and 'Y' is the disk's slice / volume number.\n(Since you didn't specify a macOS version, note that all instructions here are specific to macOS Mojave 10.14 and may vary slightly on other macOS versions).\n", "Q: What is an easy way to copy multiple specific files from one folder to another?

Our organisation needs to allow some aspect of local storage access to accommodate work on large files without constantly writing to network drives. They work on these files and then copy them to mounted AD drives.\nI want to restrict the local files that can be written to. My solution has been to create a launchagent that hides all default folders using chflags hidden and schg on the first login of a user. I have used a launchagent because of the impending threat of login hooks being removed.\nThe issue is that Documents and Downloads never have either the hidden or immutable flag applied and I have no idea why. I have added a delay before the script is run, added the script to the sudoers file so it can be run as root, changed the code, killed finder and kept it killed for the script duration, and even made the script just try to hide documents and nothing works.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\nFYI I have tried\nfind ~ -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d -not -name '.*' -not -path \"*/Library\" -not -path \"*/Desktop\" -exec sudo chflags schg {} \\; -exec sudo chflags hidden {} \\;\nsudo chflags hidden $HOME/Documents\nsudo chflags hidden ~/Documents\nsudo chflags -R hidden $HOME\nedit: Forgot to mention that manually running the script with the exact same parameters after login works and successfully hides the Documents and Downloads folder. It has to be something on login.\n\nA: Ok, I have solved this and I will explain the answer fully if anyone has a similar issue.\nThere are certain times when you will need to run a start script/event as sudo. You can do this using LaunchDaemons which are run as sudo at system boots and are run outside of a specific user session. However, there are times where you may want to run something as sudo in user context.\nTo resolve this, I initially had a plist that called an executable script with sudo as an argument, ie sudo path/to/script/script.sh\nThe script was added to visudo during the postinstall of the agent, and looked like %everyone ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /Library/Scripts/script.sh. Do not do this. I only go into such detail because to me it seems like the most logical way to go about it. Plists act oddly when parsing the sudo parameter.\nInstead, don't bother making the script executable with chmod +x and leave its permissions 700 if it is sensitive. Add a visudo command with the bash/sh parameter like %everyone ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/sh /Library/Scripts/script.sh.\nNext, and most importantly create a secondary initialiser script that will call the main script. Call the main script with sudo. This script will need at least 755 permissions. In the Plist, call the initialiser script using no parameters other than bash/sh.\nOverall, the process should be:\nPostinstall\necho '%everyone ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/sh /Library/Scripts/script.sh' | sudo EDITOR='tee -a' visudo\n\nPlist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.auspexis.myscript</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/sh</string>\n        <string>/Library/Scripts/init.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nInitialiser script:\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo sh /Library/Scripts/script.sh \n\nMain script:\nWhatever you want\n\n", "Q: Does the M1 Chip Support Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)? I am trying to understand if the new M1 Macs support Second Level Address Translation (SLAT) or if a similar technology is called something different in Apple's interpretation of this specification?\n\nA: \"Second Level Address Translation\" is known as \"Stage-2 page tables\" in the ARM world. It's not an Apple specific term, but rather a general one for the ARM architecture.\nThe M1 has got Stage-2 page tables, so it does have SLAT.\nThe M1 CPU features the ARMv8.4-A instruction set and VHE, virtualization host extensions. The CPU features exception level 0-2, which is means that you can have the hypervisor running in level 2, while the guest operating system are at level 1 and their user space's at level 0. Stage-2 page tables ensures that it you can efficiently handle page table mappings when switching between guests. ARM requires Stage-2 page tables when implementing EL2.\nThe M1 notably does not feature EL3, and it is a bit unconventional in always enabling VHE.\n", "Q: SAMSUNG Modem In 2017 iMac I have a 2017 iMac running Bug Sur 11.4.

Is it possible to prevent U2's \"Songs of Innocence\" from being downloaded to iPod during iOS update? No matter how many times I delete the album it always reappears when iOS is updated. This occurs at least on an iPod 6, iOS 12.x.\nSure, I can always delete it. But, really, why must it be considered part of the OS?\nEdit:\nI suspect I have not been sufficiently explicit on the use of this iPod. So here goes:\nI acquired it 3 years ago. At that time it received its initial population of music via iTunes, an iTunes that did not have a copy of the U2 album \"Songs of Innocence\".\nSince then the iPod has sat in a custom cradle, with two connections to the universe. One is a splitter that provides DC power input and allows audio output to my sound system. The other connection is wireless, which periodically collects iOS updates. The iPod has not been connected to iTunes or any other source of music in the past three years.\nSo as far as I can tell, the only explanation of the return of the U2 album is that it is included in iOS 12. I delete the album after every update. If there was a fix that removed the album from the operating system, that fix has failed. This tale has nothing to do with what happens on iPhones or in iTunes. So my apologies if you construe this tale otherwise. I just find the issue to be slightly annoying, that's all.\n\nA: The pod and software are designed to download everything that is in your account when you choose the default settings.

I always had this rather frustrating issue: every time I search for something, Google (which is my default search engine) asks me to accept cookies before displaying search results.\nDigging more deeply, I discovered that the problem seems to be related to cookies: Safari just doesn’t seem to save any cookie at all; if f.e.

It's displaying a \"Battery service recommended\" notification since recently\nI checked the system information. Cycle count is 437 and full charge capacity is 4770 mAh. That seems odd, since Apple estimates the warning to come up after some 1000 cycles.\nI looked in preferences to see if I had checked \"Optimised battery charging\" but the option is missing (Preferences > Battery > Battery).\nI wouldn't be bothered much since this macbook is not my daily workstation and I wouldn't mind even if it had to run on the power adapter all the time. But I'm reading about how MacOS reduces the maximum processor speed by half when the battery has this status. I've noticed how it's slower than it used to be (but I can't really tell how much of the difference is between my ears due to p[acebo/suggestion to be honest).\nI can't find much information about it, but I'm interested to know whether the reduction of cpu power is just happening while on battery or also when on AC power.\n\nA: In my experience, speed is not reduced when service battery warning starts.\nOnly when the battery is disconnected (physically or the system disconnects it) do you suffer any speed reduction (and in many cases - it's not a reduction that is evident except for benchmarks).\nThe service battery is a warning to plan for service and not a \"pull over and stop using the computer immediately\" type warning.\nOf course, all manner of other issues could happen at the same time so I would benchmark what you care about and then decide to spend for service when you are losing more money than it costs for the repair.\n", "Q: What should I expect from ANC? (mixed feelings w/Beats Studio 3 Wireless) I’ve recently purchased a pair of Beats Studio 3 Wireless and am trying to understand how ANC is supposed to work & how much sound it is supposed to block.\nThese headphones do not have a passive mode which, if I understand it, means when ANC is off they will actually let all sound from outside leak in (this is a big minus for me but it may be good if used outside).\nWith this pair, ANC off is acceptable only when home alone, otherwise the listening experience is too disturbed. When ANC is on, and someone is listening to a YouTube video on an iPad at 60% volume, I can still hear something that disturbs my concentration whenever the audio I’m listening to makes any pause. Still, if the audio is a continuous song, it is fine, I can listen unhindered.\nNow for the big doubt: when using them for conversation/phone calls, ANC is useless as every noise outside is amplified even from different rooms in the house any time I’m speaking-that is, I am not listening-. Is this normal for ANC?\nI am really confused so I am asking if someone with a better knowledge about the topic could shed some light on what I am experiencing.\nThank you\nEDIT: this question is no longer relevant as I studied Beats' & ANC specs for a few days, compared them to many other models and found out they are not responding to my expectations.\nWhat I need is a passive noise cancelling pair.\n\nA: The Beats Studio 3 Wireless basically has two settings for ANC - either it is on, or it is off.\nANC is automatically turned on when you turn on the headphones. In order to turn it off, you double-press the power button. After doing so, the small light on the left ear-cup turns off to indicate that ANC is off.\nWhen it is turned off, that is effectively the \"passive mode\". I.e. any noise dampening that happens now is solely due to the physical properties of the headphones, as the material they're made of and it's shape will block some sound from reaching your ears.\nWith this type of over-ear head phone, you should not expect the same kind of passive noise-dampening as with a pair of in-ear headphones.\nRemember that the perception of ANC is subjective. Whether this is good enough for you to hold a phone conversation or not is basically impossible for others to tell.\nYou seem to mention that outside noise is actually amplified when using ANC and you're speaking. ANC is not really meant to amplify noise. I would check that the setup you're using for recording your voice (i.e. for example VoIP software, Skype, Teams, or whatever you are using) is not setup to cause an echo-effect where you hear your own voice back.\n", "Q: Numbers formula \"can’t compare a Boolean with a number\" IF(F2<18.5,”UNDERWEIGHT”, IF(F2>25<30, “OVERWEIGHT”, IF(F2>30,”OBESE”, IF(F2<24.9>18.5,”NORMAL”))))\nI don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

When I press the power button, you hear the classic Apple sound, but the Apple logo never appears. I then hear, about every two seconds, the second half of the Apple startup sound in a loop. It's just the full \"bong\", two seconds later the latter half of the \"bong,\" two seconds later the latter half of the \"bong,\" and so on ad infinitum. The backlight remains on the entire time.\nI tired resetting NVRAM and SMC, no luck. I ran Internet Diagnostics, and it found no issues. I actually got into Internet Recovery and that loaded fully, and I ran \"First Aid\" and it found nothing. I then ran Re-install MacOS, which did it's thing, restarted, and then it was the half-bong sound over and over just like before. I tried again, same half-bong after the reboot. I erased the drive entirely with Disk Utility, reformatted, and did Re-install MacOS. Again downloaded, installed, rebooted to half-bong loop. I then created a USB drive with Fedora Linux on it, and held down Option. It appeared in the list (and so did my \"Mac OS Installer\" drive), but selecting it just repeated the Half-bong over and over.\nI'm out of ideas. Any help would be appreciated.\nEdit: Further clarification, this is a base model without Touch Bar or T1/T2. Also, I tried installing rEFInd EFI from Recovery from an external USB drive when I had no ideas left. It installed, but when I rebooted, same thing. It's almost like it's lost its ability to load from EFI of any kind. Remember that both SSD boot and USB boot aren't working.\n\nA: OK, a little embarrassing but I'll give the answer.\nI switch between Windows and Mac frequently (work/home), and when I kept following the instructions for a NVRAM reset, I kept unwittingly pressing Control+Option+P+R instead of Command+Option+P+R. And so I tried resetting NVRAM several times having no idea I wasn't actually resetting it properly.\nOnce I realized this from a GIF animation on a website (a picture is worth a thousand words), I tried an NVRAM reset again and it fixed my problem.\nAlso kids - don't try installing Solus Linux on a MacBook Pro 2017. I tired installing it the first time and it corrupted the NVRAM like this. After fixing it with my instructions above, I tried again and it once again corrupted the NVRAM. Unlike many Linux distributions, It won't work.\n", "Q: How to see the duration of a FaceTime call? The following Apple resource says the duration should be available by clicking the \"I\".

The app store said it was unavailable so I purchased a bootable usb installer but it won't install. What do I need to do\n\nA: Two options to try here: bodge the date, or get a new installer.\nI used to provide USB installers for old macOS, including El Capitan. This sounds a lot like the installer certificate has expired. What's happening is the computer date is past the certificate expiry, and it throws an error. Without knowing the exact error, it's hard to be 100% sure, but El Capitan was one of the more frequently twitchy installers in my time doing USBs.\nThe installers were re-signed in 2019 to last until 2029, but if you've bought a USB from someone, it's entirely possible it's a pre-2019 image and has the expiry issue.\nMy suggestion would be to reset the date on the computer to a time in the past when the certificate was valid, install El Capitan, and when you're up and running you can reset the date to the correct date. I don't think you'll have any issues with downloading software updates for it after you're installed, so it should be safe to:\n\n*\n\n*force the date to a time in the past\n\n*install El Capitan\n\n*fix the date to the correct one\n\n*get your updates (there will be a bunch)\n\nTo force the date and trick the installer, take a look at this post:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/219067/266438\nFailing that, or if you just want a clean installer, at the time of my reply there's a full El Capitan download here:\nhttp://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-41424-20191024-218af9ec-cf50-4516-9011-228c78eda3d2/InstallMacOSX.dmg\nNote that will need a working Mac to download to. You'll need to download it, open the DMG, run the installer inside it which will make the Install MacOS El Capitan.app and then you need to make a USB, which you can do with this link:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nThe command for El Capitan is:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\nYou'll need to change MyVolume to the name of your USB installer, but it should take care of the rest for you.\n\nA: To boot from your bootable USB, hold the alt or option key (depending on if your keyboard is Windows or Mac) on startup until you see options on what disk to boot from. Then, select your bootable USB and boot up from it and it will bring up an installer. If it shows a / with a circle when you click the USB installer, the Operating System is not compatible with your computer.\n", "Q: How can I fix when macOS defaults write -data fails with single quote error?

I have an iPhone that is not managed by an organization. By using configuration profiles, I want to apply settings that cannot be set via the GUI. Those settings contain passwords and therefore I need a secure way to transfer the configuration profiles to my iPhone.\nAs I do not have access to other Apple devices, what possibilities do I have?\n\nA: According to the documentation...\n\nThere are five ways to deploy configuration profiles:\n\n*\n\n*Using Apple Configurator 2,\navailable in the App Store\n\n*In an email message\n\n*On a webpage\n\n*Using over-the-air configuration as described in Over-the-Air Profile Delivery and\nConfiguration\n\n*Over the air using a Mobile Device Management Server\n\n\nAs Apple Configurator is only available for macOS and both Over-the-Air Profile Delivery and MDM solutions are solutions for enterprises, you are probably left with e-mail message or a webpage.\nYou can of course also use any 3rd party app that offers some sort of file sharing/synchronization. But as you want to transfer sensitive information, make sure you use an app with end-to-end encryption, where you are the single owner of the encryption keys.\nVia e-mail\nYou can easily send a configuration profile via e-mail. As soon as you click on the attachment, it will be loaded and you can install it from the Settings app.\nBut as you want to transfer it securely, a simple e-mail won't do it. Again, you need end-to-end encryption because the file will travel through the internet. You can achieve that by setting up S/MIME for your e-mail, for example. But I am not sure, if you can do it already as a consumer with the Apple mail app. You might need a 3rd party app for that.\nVia webpage\nIt sounds like an overkill, but that can be done easily and securely with free open source tools and just your laptop. Steps you need:\n\n*\n\n*Interconnect your laptop and iPhone via WiFi (ad hoc network, no router needed, just the two devices)\n\n*Setup a temporary HTTPS web server with Python to serve the configuration profile\n\n*???\n\n*Profit: Access the configuration profile securely through Safari on your iPhone\n\nThis is how you can do it with a Windows laptop:\n\n*\n\n*Create a wireless ad hoc network. Use ipconfig afterwards to determine the IP address of your laptop for this network.\n\n\n*Connect your iPhone to this network, as you would with any other WiFi.\n\n\n*Create a self signed certificate that you will need for your web server. You can use OpenSSL for example. You already got that, if you have Git for Windows installed. You find it at <GIT_INSTALL_PATH>\\bin or <GIT_INSTALL_PATH>\\mingw64\\bin. To create that certificate, just execute:\n.\\openssl.exe req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -keyout localhost.pem -out localhost.pem -nodes\n\n\n\n*Create the following folder structure to serve your configuration profile from:\n/\n└── www/\n    ├── html/\n    │   └── MyConfigProfile.mobileconfig\n    └── localhost.pem\n\n\n\n*Use html as your working directory and use Python 3 to start a HTTPS web server from there. Replace <IP> by the IP address you retrieved in step 1. You can also adjust the port address (2021), if you want:\nimport http.server, ssl\n\nserver_address = ('<IP>', 2021)\nhttpd = http.server.HTTPServer(server_address, http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)\nhttpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, server_side=True, certfile='../localhost.pem', ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS)\nhttpd.serve_forever()\n\n\n\n*On your iPhone, open Safari and access https://<IP>:2021/MyConfigProfile.mobileconfig (replace <IP> by the IP address you retrieved in step 1). As you are using a self signed certificate, Safari cannot verify it and will complain. This is normally a security concern, but as you are the owner of both sides it is totally fine.

I have a relatively new MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2020) just under 1 year old with only 66 cycles reported on the battery.\nQuestion: If I have to1 leave it for several weeks powered-off and completely unplugged from anything and WiFi turned off, is there any information out there as to roughly how far the battery will drop?\nWill the total drop divided by the total number of days be perhaps 0.5% per day? 1%? or even 2%? Are there any benchmarks or sources for this kind of information?\nWhy not check it yourself?\nRight now I use my laptop very regularly and just don't have any opportunity to \"experiment\" on it turned off for a whole weekend much less a week, and there's always the possibility of a little nonlinearity and/or offset at the upper limit.\n1This is not a hypothetical question! I will be needing to do this at some point and would like to have some expectation of the outcome ahead of time. Finding one's self with a low battery and no means of charging it is an issue that a Stack Exchange question can't address.\n\nI'm also curious if there anything inside that would actually draw enough current that would impact the battery's otherwise natural rate of loss, but that's probably a separate question.\n\nA: A battery’s dissipation rate depends on several factors like\n\n*\n\n*quality/condition of the battery\n\n*Ambient temperature\n\n*Charge level at time of hibernation or power off\n\n*Whether you power it off or only sleep it\n\nThis is by no means a comprehensive list; just the obvious factors. The current condition of the battery is quite frankly an unknown since nobody but a qualified technician (scientist) can accurately measure the SEI layer to quantify this.\nThe other factors you can measure/record with some degree of certainty but insofar as there being some formula or study, you aren’t likely to find one. Each battery ages differently due to the vast differences of how people use and treat their machines.\nTo get a good estimate, you would need to base it on experience with your MacBook.  However, in my personal work experience, I have had laptops (pre Li ion) sit in storage for 4 to 6 weeks (school laptops) and hold a majority of their charge.\nOne caveat is whether you sleep or power off your machine.  If you have no use for periodic updates and checking of messages (see Power Nap) then you should power  off to minimize the dissipation rate.\nFor a reasonable estimate, I personally have current (2019 - 2021) era laptops from Microsoft Surface and a MacBook Air maintain a full charge for well over a month of non use and not being plugged in.  Your “several weeks” should be fine.\n", "Q: CarPlay starts playing music after activating Siri even if no music was playing before This issue has been driving me nuts: if I listen to music or a podcast, pause it, and then activate Siri using “Hey Siri,” the moment the Siri interaction ends it resumes playing the music/podcast, even though it has been paused before. This is natural behavior for when I interrupt playing audio, but very annoying when I’m driving with no music on.\nI’ve tested this and it happens with Spotify and the Apple Podcasts app, suggesting it’s a system-level issue. It doesn’t happen if there’s nothing playing in the “now playing” drop down in control center. It also doesn’t happen is I force quit the audio app before activating Siri.\nIs there some setting I can tweak to change this behavior, or is this just a bug?\n\nA: I have found that the play/pause button on the screen will actually stop the music. The volume button can also act as a play/pause button, but when I call up Siri, the music will play once she is done. I wasn't sure if there was a bug or some strange design, but I learned a muscle memory to hit the correct button.\n", "Q: macOS enable reduce transparency option except for dock?

I recently accidentally deleted some system files of macOS and thus, reinstalled macOS Big Sur in recovery mode.\nI have been assured that any data will not be lost, but I am wondering what exactly comes under ‘data’.\nI assume it means files, apps etc. but what about things like my preferences for various apps and changes I made in system preferences? Or, my saved passwords in safari? Does that come under ‘data’?\nAlso, if possible, could you provide what exactly will be lost/ changed and what will not.\nNote: Before my re-install, I was running the latest version of macOS I.e 11.4\n\nA: All the things you list are user data and settings that the macOS upgrade and update and reinstalllation  process will leave alone.\nTime Machine has a compare feature where you could generate a delta between what is on disk and what the last backup interval saved.\n\n*\n\n*Find Differences between Time Machine backups\nBasically, Data is what you did to change the stock Mac so files, pictures, apps you install and all the settings like time zone, Siri, sleep settings and more are all considered user data and not the system.\n", "Q: Can I view previous passwords?

Turn off the internet so it doesn’t perform a sync, then check your password there.\nIf not, follow the password reset functionality of the website.\n", "Q: Swap red and blue channels in application I have an old application which renders with the red and blue channels swapped. Is there a way I can use a color filter or display profiles or something else to fix this? I'm willing to use a solution that's either specific to the application or global to the system so long as it can be easily toggled.\n\nA: Depending on how often you need the application you could use OBS to capture the window and aplly a filter like the streamfx color filter to the image to fix it and then view the output in the preview window. This is pretty unpractical if you want to use the application a lot, but for using it seldomly this should work.\n", "Q: Why is Spotlight draining my new M1 MacBook Air's battery? I purchased the new M1 MacBook Air 2020 a week ago, and the battery gets drained in about 2-3 hours of browsing the web (I use Firefox).\nAccording to my Activity Monitor, Spotlight is consuming 94.02 of my \"12 hr Power.\" Some people have stated that it's Spotlight \"indexing\" the entire MacBook; I'm not sure if that's fine.\nDo I visit the nearest Apple store to get my MacBook replaced? Or what do I do?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Consider that this behavior could go away on its own. This might be something that needs to be done once for your system and will use less power once it is fully done the first time.\nThe first tech-support measure you take in any case is to restart your Mac. This solves most problems I have in general.\nNext I would try updating the Mac, an update could contain a fix to this specific problem.\nAt this point you could contact customer support and try to get them to warranty repair/replace it, or you could try backing up all your data and factory resetting the device. If you are not tech saavy definately get help backing it up first to ensure you do not destroy valuable pictures/documents.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Disable kids' access to iOS device after 11pm, but also allow parents to remotely and temporarily enable/disable access? Our teenage kids have been staying up too late on their iPhones, so we'd like to figure out a way to prevent them from using devices after 11PM.  But we'd also like to be able to have a way to temporarily turn this off, e.g. if we know they'll be out late and we want to enable them to text us.\nMy understanding (correct?) is that we can do everything above via Screen Time, but that disabling Screen Time (temporarily or otherwise) requires physically entering the password on the device. Is there a way to do the disabling/enabling remotely instead? Does Family Sharing do this? If yes, what are the limitations or challenges with Family Sharing for Screen Time control?\n\nA: You don’t need to disable anything temporarily for the use case you have described. You can use Screen Time Communication Limits to allow certain contacts, e.g. you, to still be contactable in time periods that are configured to be downtime.

I have a new Apple Watch Series 6. It's very nice.\nLast night, before going upstairs to bed, I looked at it, and it was blank. I thought maybe it had run out of battery so I tapped it and a very (and I mean very) faint image of the time appeared, but it was not my clock face - it was just the time in large (very faint) numbers in the top right. I tapped it again and a (very faint) icon and a message appeared, and then disappeared after about a second or so. I tapped it again and the same happened. The message was so tiny, so faint, and so brief that it took me about five or six minutes to finally read it. It said, \"Turn Digital Crown to unlock watch\" (or something similar).\nSearching for this message returns result after result about ejecting water, but the message said nothing about water, I don't remember a \"water drop icon filling up\" as I rotated the crown, and I don't remember any tones playing (which is how I think the water is ejected). Also, I'd been sat on the sofa for most of the evening - nowhere near water. Rotating the crown restored normal functionality (and I didn't have to enter my passcode).\nI'm confused for two reasons:\n\n*\n\n*because I don't know why it was locked\n\n*because the message was so damn hard to read.\n\nThis second is baffling me. The message was so faint that I had to turn off all the lights in the room to read it, and even then it was so small that I could barely read it without my glasses (which I generally only wear for VDU work). Given that there was nothing else on the screen, why would an important message like this be so small and difficult to read?\nI imagine this might have been something to do with my Bedtime (Sleep Schedule) settings in my phone, which would have activated by this time, but I can't find any information on this because every search result I find keeps talking about water!\nAny idea what was happening?\n\nA: This is related to the sleeping mode. The sleeping mode \"locks\" the watch and turns the brightness down a lot so that the watch does not disturb you during your sleep.\nYou can change your sleep shedule right on the watch.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Sleep app  on your Apple Watch.\n\n\n*Tap Full Schedule, then do one of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Change a sleep schedule: Tap the current schedule.\n\n*Add a sleep schedule: Tap Add Another Schedule.\n\n*Change your sleep goal: Tap Sleep Goal, then set the amount of time you want to sleep.\n\n*Change Wind Down time: Tap Wind Down, then set the amount of time you want sleep mode to be active before bedtime.\n\nTo reduce distractions before your scheduled bedtime, sleep mode turns on during Wind Down. Sleep mode turns off the watch display and turns on Do Not Disturb.\n\n\n*Do any of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Set the days for your schedule: Tap your schedule, then tap the area below Active On. Choose days, then tap Done.\n\n*Adjust your wake time and bedtime: Tap Wake Up or Bedtime, turn the Digital Crown to set a new time, then tap Set.\n\n*Set the alarm options: Turn Alarm off or on and tap Sound to choose an alarm sound.\n\n*Remove or cancel a sleep schedule: Tap Delete Schedule (at the bottom of the screen) to remove an existing schedule, or tap Cancel (at the top of the screen) to cancel creating a new one.\n\n\n\nYou can also disable automatic sleep mode in the watch settings app:\nTaps sleep and tap Sleep Mode, then turn off this option to manually control sleep mode in Control Center.\n", "Q: New MacBook but two-facor-auth codes are sent to old one I bought a new MacBook Pro 2020 and want to retire my MacBook Air 2012.\nSince I wanted to start all installations from zero I did not use the migration assistant.\nEverything works great.

For macOS to reclaim this free space, the APFS container would have to be first cloned to the free space. In this case, there is enough free space to accomplish this. The steps are given below.\n\nThis answer was tested using Catalina (macOS 10.15.7). For Big Sur, see this question.\n\nThis answer uses the asr restore command and verb to clone the APFS container. The default argument is --useReplication. However, this results in error messages when resizing the new APFS container. Therefore, the legacy --useInverter argument is used instead. This argument requires that all volumes in the target container must be unmounted and the source volume can not have any local snapshots in it.\n\n*\n\n*Delete any local snapshots. An example is given below.

According to the Apple article How to reinstall macOS, using the Option-Command-R or the Shift-Option-Command-R key combination during startup will only boot to a Catalina version of macOS Recovery for certain Macs.\n\n\n*Boot from macOS Recovery stored in the hidden Recovery volume. For example, using the Command-R key combination during startup. In tests, this alternative appeared to work. However, when booted to macOS Recovery, the Recovery volume is mounted read-only and can not be unmounted.

I'm expecting there to be different models with different amounts of CPU and RAM. What is the quickest way to identify the specifications of each laptop? Should I bring a charger or a screwdriver?\n\nA: The other answers already cover how to extract the specs so I want to touch on this piece:\n\nI am to visit a storage unit full of relatively new ( 2015 - 2020 ) used MacBooks to pick one for myself.\n\nWhat? is this normal?\nDo you plan to buy a laptop without making sure it boots up?\nShouldn't a charger be supplied with the laptop you choose?\nShouldn't the seller have specs posted? How do you know the price before you pick it up?\nWhy aren't these machines already factory reset and bootable? If you can't get to the system info screen then how can you trust what you see?\nI'm hoping they have their specs posted somewhere so all you need to worry about is verifying specs right before handing over your money.\nSomething seems quite fishy...\n\nA: The serial number should be printed on the back and can be used on https://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/ to get the spec details. Unfortunately this will not show built-to-order details, so your best bet is to charge and boot (at least into Recovery) those which look interesting.\n\nA: If you want to see build to order specs you can boot the mac into recovery mode and start a terminal.\nThen you can use the /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPHardwareDataType SPHardwareDataType command to get a full overview of the hardware.\nTo boot into the recovery mode, use command + r on startup.\nThis does require however that the previous users did not set a firmware password. If you bring a wifi hotspot or an ehternet cable (with the appropriate adapter) you also could boot newer Macs to Internet Recovery, so there are lots of options to get detailed information even if you might be foiled by an account password that’s missing.\n\nA: nohillside's answer (looking up the serial number) looks pretty good. If, however, there's a good chance that the computer's have had changes made to them (e.g. ram or hd upgrades or removals) then I recommend bringing a boot disk on usb-a (like usb 2 or usb 3) and usb-c flash drives. Apple and ifixit have guides for creating install media boot drives. Don't use the boot drive to reset/erase/restore/install anything; use the tools included (e.g. Disk Utility and Terminal) to check the system. I believe that these instructions, for use with recovery mode, will work, with little to no modification, from the install media boot drive.\n", "Q: Enhancing anti-tracking measures Recently, Facebook introduced a “feature” that makes any link to a Wordpress blog fail.  I found a way to reverse those effects for my own blog, but it would be cool to do the same if I were to click such an altered link in Facebook or Google.\nCan any of the following be done, and if so, how?\nOne way (if possible) would be to have JavaScript (or any other language) that runs on page load to check and possibly rewrite links in the page.  Not one embedded in the page but applied by the browser to any incoming page.\nAnother would be a way to tell the browser to pass every http(s) through such a function.\nDo the conversion in a proxy or firewall on anything going out on ports 80 or 443.

I’ve been restored my current MacBook Pro (1 TB) from time machine successfully almost ~100 times by now. I’m looking to buy a new MacBook Pro with M1 chip, and started to think 256 GB storage is perfect for me because I only use about 100GB of disk space. It’s faster for me to backup/restore from a smaller backups. If I decided to buy a new Mac that have only 256GB instead of 1 TB MacBook, will I lose any of the performance advantages?\n\nA: There are some slight disadvantages of a smaller drive.\nThe time to restore from backup will not change depending on the drive's size, only on the quantity of data stored on it, subject to 2. below.\n\n*\n\n*Smaller drives get full more easily [obviously] & you can't upgrade the drive on a modern Mac, so you'd have to use an external.\n\n\n*Full drives are slower to read/write. This is mainly to do with how drives erase & re-use sectors after they are 'empty'. The system periodically cleans up unused sectors using a method known as TRIM. A sector marked as 'trimmed' can be written to immediately. A sector which hasn't yet been 'trimmed' first needs to be erased. This is quite a bit slower.\n\n\n*Smaller drives wear out more quickly as they have less ability to spread out their writes to unused portions of the drive.\nIf you have limited RAM, then virtual memory is subject to both factors 1 & 2, as it needs to be able to read & write to the drive frequently.\n", "Q: Samsung Portable SSD T7 Not Recognized in Big Sur The Samsung T7 Portable SSD has an encrypted volume that only becomes visible to or usable by macOS when the drive is unlocked using the Samsung Portable SSD software.  For an unknown reason (possibly after installing the latest macOS 11.4 Big Sur upgrade?), the Samsung software stopped recognizing that the drive was plugged in.  Various solutions online have suggestions for older versions of macOS, but none is effective for the latest operating system version (even reinstalling macOS does not help).  The drive and Samsung software work perfectly on other machines (other Macbooks, PCs, etc.), so it is a software issue specific to this one Mac machine.\n\nA: The root issue appears to be that none of the suggested solutions actually does a full removal of the Samsung Portable SSD software.  Therefore, when you try to reinstall the software, macOS doesn't prompt you to approve the security exception for the software in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy.  In turn, the reinstalled software doesn't work / doesn't have the correct permissions to access the SSD.\nHere is the sequence of steps I finally came up with that fully removes all traces of the PSSD software and got me back to a working state.

I click on green Zoom button while having option key pressed in attempt to maximize the window. Finder window changes between smaller size and larger size, but doesn't maximize to fill the desktop space.\nI am not after going into full screen mode, which creates new pane and switches to it, I simply would like to maximize Finder without dragging corners of it to manually fill the space of the desktop.\nEDIT: I actually noticed another intruiguing behavior. Green Zoom button will change Finder windows size to different one depending on which Folder/Location is currently selected. Is this a bug?\n\n\nA: It's been this way for quite some time on macOS.\nIt's not really a bug, it's a feature, just one that confuses many people ;)\nOpt/clicking the green dot on a Finder will maximise 'to show all the information'. This will only reach the screen edges in either direction if there is enough content to warrant it. Also, it will not automatically re-flow icons in order to do it.\nThat's why it can look like different windows behave differently - they're following the same rules, which may not give the same visual result.\ne.g. (intentionally small images}\none icon wide vs 3 icons wide vs list view… icon view expands downwards only, list view also expands wider to include all columns.\n\nIf you specifically want the window to fill the entire screen, then hold  Opt ⌥  and double click any window corner.\nThere are variations on this, just double-clicking a corner will expand from the opposite corner until both clicked edges hit the screen edge. Similarly for double clicking any edge.\nNone of these double-click variants have an 'opposite'. They don't toggle like the green button variant.\nThere are also 'drag' variants of all these, grabbing an edge or a corner whilst holding  Shift ⇧  or  Opt ⌥  will show you a multitude of ways to expand a window - too many to really remember;)\nThese drag methods also work on file-pickers (file open & save dialog boxes.)\n", "Q: How to achieve oflag=direct in dd on MacOS? I have installed gdd on MacOS.\nI figured out both dd and gdd don't support oflag=direct option.\n ‘direct’\n      Use direct I/O for data, avoiding the buffer cache.  Note that\n      the kernel may impose restrictions on read or write buffer\n      sizes.  For example, with an ext4 destination file system and\n      a Linux-based kernel, using ‘oflag=direct’ will cause writes\n      to fail with ‘EINVAL’ if the output buffer size is not a\n      multiple of 512.\n\nfrom dd(1) on Linux\nAnd the built-in dd doesn't even support conv=fsync.\nI am wondering how to achieve oflag=direct in dd or gdd on MacOS?\n\nA: How to achieve it depends on what you are trying to do:\nIf you're just trying to copy data from one disk to another, which is a very common use case for dd, you would typically achieve something similar to oflag=direct simply by using the right block device.\nI.e. for example if you're copying like this:\ndd if=/dev/disk0 of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m\n\nYou can speed it up by using raw disk access like this:\ndd if=/dev/rdisk0 of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m\n\nNote that the names of the block devices have been prefixed with \"r\", which stands for a \"raw\" device.\nIf you're not copying between block devices like that, there's still a way to get something similar to oflag=direct on Linux:\nThe reason why it's not implemented the same way as Linux, and thus not directly ported over when porting GNU dd to macOS, is that the macOS kernel simply does not support the O_DIRECT flag for fcntl.\nThe flag came to the Linux kernel about about 20 years ago as an \"inspiration\" from the similarly named flag in SGI IRIX. You set it on an file descriptor in order to bypass the normal caching subsystem.\nHowever macOS originally did not have its cache configuration per file descriptor - instead it had it per vnode. Think of this as the difference between having the cache configuration set for a file per se, and having the cache configuration set for a particular instance of an open file. I.e. in the latter case, two different programs could be working on the same file with different cache configurations.\nThis meant that back then (i.e. 20+ years ago) macOS could not adopt O_DIRECT from SGI IRIX like Linux did, but they instead opted to create an option named F_NOCACHE. This also turns the ordinary caching subsystem off, but does per file instead of per file descriptor. Later on, macOS actually changed the workings of the operating system to have the cache configuration per file descriptor instead of per vnode, so now it's more or less the same thing.\nYou might ask - what did Linux users do before they got O_DIRECT? - They actually used the same type of \"raw\" devices as macOS also offers, and that I described above. Instead of prefixing them with \"r\" they were typically prefixed by \"raw\", but otherwise it is the same concept.\nIn practice, if you're just copying disks with dd, it is convenient to just use the raw devices. If you're trying to achieve something else, you probably belong to a niche use case, which isn't directly supported. To me it sounds like the easiest way forward there would be to change the gdd implementation and add a fcntl for F_NOCACHE, similarly to the O_DIRECT one that has been removed from the macOS port.\nHowever, depending on what you're trying to do, you should be aware of slight differences in the semantics of the flags. For example if you want to use O_DIRECT in order to do benchmarking, you need to take additional care. F_NOCACHE is namely different from O_DIRECT in that while it does not add data to the cache, it will read data from the cache if it is already there for some reason. This will increase performance, but that might not be what you want for benchmarking.\n", "Q: Backup Finder sidebar favorites in file Is there a way to backup my finder sidebar \"Favorites\" on the left with all my shortcuts to folders on our network drive?\nIs this sidebar stored in a file somewhere that I can backup?\nEvery once in a while the whole sidebar is messed up, so all network folders are gone or the name is just a ? instead of the real folder name.\nIf there are many folders it takes way too long to restore all of that by hand (and also I can't remember all those folders until I need it and notice that it's missing).\n\nA: The sidebar will forget those mounted network aliases every time it can't find one.\nThe 'fix', although a bit clunky, is to mount the remote drives, directly alias them on the desktop, then move the aliases somewhere permanent.\nThen they never break.\n\nA: There are two plist files in the Library that have all the finder settings.\nThe files are located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\nYou can open one by copying the path, opening finder, click on go, then go to folder and paste the path in there. This way you can create and restore a backup of the sidebar.\n\nA: You can backup file in\n~/Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.FavoriteItems.sfl2\nrestore this file need to login out.\nI test in 10.14.6 ok\n\nA: It may be better to use alternate methods of 'saving' network shares as aliases in the Finder, e.g. on the Desktop (or better, in a sub-folder of the Desktop to keep things tidy!); or in the Dock.\n", "Q: SMS formatting rules for iPhone - numbers, phone numbers, tracking numbers I'm looking for list of rules that iPhone applies on incoming SMS texts. Here's an example of message I have received:\n\nThe first number in the text is postal tracking number. iPhone thinks it's a phone number and displays it as underlined blue, clickable number. First mistake.\nSecond blurred number is PIN for package delivery, the number I'm supposed to say when taking the package. iPhone sort of knows this is somewhat important and underlines it. When tapped, I get option to copy the PIN value. Correct behavior.\nThird blurred number is driver's phone number. In case I'm unavailable at destination address, I can call them up and tell them to come elsewhere or at different time. Notice the missing space after every sentence. iPhone didn't recognize this number and I have no way to copy this number and call it. iPhone only allows me to copy the entire message text, not portion of it. If I receive this text in traffic, I am in no position to fiddle with my phone while driving, so I just ignore the text and miss the package.\nIf no list of rules is available, how should the carrier format their SMS texts, so that iPhone correctly recognizes every piece of information in them?\n\nA: Is that number directly diallable without a leading zero? It looks like only 9 digits, which certainly wouldn't work in the UK (& I always thought the UK & EU synchronised systems a long time ago).\nI expect phone numbers to be either within the same country 01234 567 890 with the leading zero, 11 digits total, or the international equivalent [which still works from 'home'] +44 1234 567 890 i.e. 12 digits, including +2-digit country code, minus the leading zero. From a mobile phone, they are the only two dialling schemes possible [other than some very specific numbers, emergency etc.]\nWhen mobiles became popular, the UK abandoned the \"local\" phone number scheme entirely with shorter dialling for local areas for land lines, and mobile phones must always use the entire 11 or 12 digit dialling system, even if ringing the same town.\n", "Q: How do I run a sudo command at login/logout on macOS I'm trying to run a command at login/logout which requires sudo. I've read about LaunchDaemon and LaunchAgent but as I understand it, LaunchDaemon will run the command at startup with root permissions, and LaunchAgent will run it at login but with the current user permissions, which won't always be an administrator.\nAlternatively, is there a way to run my command without the need of sudo? I'm trying to wipe all files in the home directories (Desktop, Documents etc.) on user login/logout so am currently using sudo rm -rf /users/randomuser/Desktop/* etc. Similar to how a guest account works, but without the account being guest and with a little more control. I'm pretty new to this kind of thing so please explain like I'm 5. More than happy to try out another solution if required. Thanks!\nEDIT - Thanks for the help so far. Here's a bit more detail about the use case:\nI have a mac that will be used by myself (admin) and a few other people (second account). I don't want data to persist between logins on this second account, similar to how the Guest Account works. The problem with the guest account is, it resets applications placed in the dock between logins as well as resetting the desktop wallpaper (which I would like to keep the same throughout logins). My solution was to set up a standard account, lock the dock using defaults write com.apple.Dock size-immutable -bool yes and set the wallpaper manually. As for the data, I would like all files that have been downloaded or transferred by the user to be wiped when the user logs out (or equally, when the next user logs in). Alternatively, If there is a way for the Guest Account to not reset the dock and wallpaper on logout, this would also work.

That can be tremendously time-consuming and headache-inducing to undo, assuming it can be undone at all. It isn't necessarily bad to use the Finder, you just need to be aware that the Finder's interface for permissions and ACLs is simplified for non-technical users. It doesn't give as much control as one would get in a terminal session or shell script, and makes some assumptions about what the user wants that are probably generally true, but not spelled out in detail.\nIt's best to think of a file system as the proverbial china shop.

By running id, i see 80(admin) was listed there.\nWent to System Preferences -> Users & Groups, I saw my name (full name not my username) is listed under Current User as Admin, Mobile.\nFollowed other posts online, i was able to find /etc/sudoers.d folder and sudoers file, and right click get Info, i added my username back to the permission list which allow me to read and write, the changes were made to both /etc/sudoers.d folder and sudoers file.\n\nAt one point of time i was able to run sudo visudo /private/etc/sudoers and found out the line for admin was commented out, so i removed the comment to re-enable it, now the file has root and admin enabled, no other user:\nroot        ALL = (ALL) ALL\nadmin       ALL = (ALL) ALL\n\nand at the bottom of the file, i saw:\n## Read drop-in files from /private/etc/sudoers.d\n## (the '#' here does not indicate a comment)\n#includedir /private/etc/sudoers.d\n\nafter all these changes i still cannot run sudo:\nsudo brew update\nsudo: 4294967295,2416387072,32767,0,0,0,0,0,0,0: invalid value\nsudo: error initializing audit plugin sudoers_audit\nsudo brew update\nPassword:\n<my username> is not in the sudoers file.

By removing it in sudoers you actually removed your own rights from it. Assuming you can still edit it, you should be able to add the % back.\nIf you can't edit it, see sudo: /etc/sudoers is owned by uid 501, should be 0 for alternative ways to change it.\nPS: Your username is the name shown behind the red \"username(Me)\" part in the screenshots. You can also see it by running id -un in Terminal.\n", "Q: How to spoof \"open\" command Basically, an app I am using executes something such as open -a \"App One\", but I'd like it to open App Two instead\nTrying to do something such as intercept the command, in order to execute open -a \"App Two\"\n\nA: The easy solution is to hot patch the app so it opens what you please. Depending on if the app is interpreted or compiled you may run into gatekeeper and code signing / notarization traps.\nNext hard is to modify the open command to special case this. You will run into code signing issues there on most recent macOS so patching the app to call a second version of that tool, might be slightly easier or harder based on your skill level,to compile a command line binary.\nMessing with the launch services database is an option, but you likely will get caught spoofing that.\nCracking macOS launch daemon itself would be the crown jewel spoof and might get you bug bounty money from Apple if your exploit qualifies under the terms of that program.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/\n\nA: An easy solution is simply to change the PATH environment variable for this particular app, so that when it searches for the open command, it will look first in a folder, where you place an alternative open command.\nFor example start the program from the Terminal like this - notice that the change to PATH happens at the front, so that your folder is searched before others:\nPATH=~/myopen:$PATH /Applications/ThisApp.app/Contents/MacOS/ThisApp\n\nIf you prefer not using the Terminal here, you could use Automator or similar to create an icon you can double-click that simply runs that command.\nNow in the ~/myopen folder you place a substitute for the real open command. Create a text file named simply open (no extension) containing for example:\n#!/bin/bash                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\nif [[ \"$@\" == \"-a App1\" ]]; then\n  /usr/bin/open -a App2\nelse\n  /usr/bin/open \"$@\"\nfi\n\nFinally make the new open command executable by running this command:\nchmod a+x ~/myopen/open\n\nNote that the above is just inspiration - you need to actually substitute your own application names in, etc.\n", "Q: Small image of iPad circled on iPad: meaning?

I need to update the Xcode to the latest version.\nWhile trying to update the Big Sur it asks it needs 30 GB. My machine does not have enough space.\nHow can I add an additional disk to increase the storage in my machine? Any input on this?\n\n\n\n\nA: You can't make a disk bigger. You can add additional external storage, though on a laptop, having external drives hanging off can be impractical.\nYou need to remove some of the data on that disk to another drive. A clean system is only c. 11 Gb, so all the rest will be apps and documents that you've added.\nAs said in the comments, your disk is dangerously full anyway. I would advise keeping 30Gb free at all times, even after installing Xcode.\n", "Q: How to include the DOMAIN\\ in the name autofilled field when connecting to a Samba share from Finder?

How do I force the DOMAIN\\ to be included?\n\nA: What works is to specify the DOMAIN by connecting via Go → Connect to Server  (via this crazy old site).\nsmb://DOMAIN;User@machine.somewhere.com/Share\n\nYou can mark this as a favorite in the “connect” dialog as well as add the resulting shared folder to Finder Sidebar or even drag it into startup items system preference pane.\n", "Q: Does Time Machine keep a log of files added / modified / removed during each backup? Alternatively is it possible to enable this as a configuration option?\nI know that it's possible to export a diff between two Time Machine backups, however, it takes ages, it literally takes an hour over a network drive - therefore it's almost unusable except for a very narrow use case when the value of that information is so high that it's worth a high cpu, high network one hour long operation.\nIn case it's familiar to someone, I'm interested in something like Synology's HyperBackup does: it keeps a CSV file of all modified files during a backup.\n\nA: No, Time Machine does not keep such a log. The only way to generate such an overview is to compare two backups. You can cache that information so it only has to be done once, but it is still a relatively intensive task that needs to be performed by third party software.\nThere's no option or setting that makes Time Machine keep such a log.\n\nA: I use a perl script called timedog, which fairly quickly provides a list of those files added to any given backup. By default, the last backup.\nhttps://github.com/nlfiedler/timedog\n\nA: Depending on how you want to use these lists, a tool like BackupLoupe can come in extremely handy to make an online database of file changes that you can search without needing the drives to be cataloged or searched at query time.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/\n", "Q: \"The Apple Store app is not available in your country or region\" after Apple Store update on iPad After Apple Store update I've got \"The Apple Store app is not available in your country or region\", and my country is missing from the list (it's Ukraine).

I have an iMac with an internal Fusion Drive, and I've since wiped that drive installed macOS on an external Thunderbolt SSD for speed.\nI'd like to install Windows 10 on my iMac's blank internal drive, preferably using Boot Camp (I'm aware there are other methods).\nWhen I start Boot Camp Assistant, it says \"External storage device attached\" and tells me to remove all external storage. I can't of course, since it's referring to my SSD which macOS is actually running from. I assume this is just some sort of warning to make sure you know what you're doing with your target drives so,\nIs there a way to bypass the message and carry on with the installer? Or do I have to go some other route like using a Windows install USB?\n\nA: Install macOS on the internal drive. Remove the external drive. Use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows on the internal drive. Connect and boot from the external drive. (Optional) Erase macOS on the internal drive and reuse the space.\nI should note that there are third party tools such as Winclone which can be used used to install Windows to the entire HDD of a Fusion Drive.\n\nOne possible alternate solution can be outlined by the following steps.\n\n*\n\n*ExFat format a flash drive.\n\n*Mount the Windows 10 ISO and copy the files to the flash drive.\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software.\n\n*Copy the Windows Support Software to the flash drive.\n\n*Boot from the flash drive.\n\n*Install Windows to the internal HDD. (The Windows installer will read the Windows Support Software files.)\n\n*Install the Windows Support Software.

I've tried with 1- and 2-digit track numbers. I've tried with and without a trailing newline.\nDoes anyone have any experience with this application and this feature?\n\nA: Ok, by some trial and error: it seems the pattern matching isn't too sophisticated, so I tried it in multiple passes.  In other words, first set the artist by using the text:\n01 Peter Howard\n02 Martin Figura\n03 Andrea Porter\n04 André Mangeot\n…\n\nand the format string %n %a (other steps the same).  Then set the track names using the text:\n01 Package\n02 Nirvana\n03 Fresh Meat\n04 The Shout\n\nand the format string %n %t.

I have a work flow now that:\n\n*\n\n*asks for the project name\n\n*asks where the project folder needs to be stored\n\n*then creates the sub folders that I will be using.\n\nSuch as a folder named \"Project 1\" then inside are the sub folders named \"images\", \"Photoshop\", \"drafts\", \"Illustrator\" and so on.\n\nI am trying to create a folder action that sorts files that are added to the project root folder into the an appropriate sub folder, either by file extension or by part fo the file names.\nFor example:\n\n*\n\n*.jpg files shoudl be moved to the image folder\n\n*.psd files should be moved to the Photoshop folder\n\n*file names that contain the word \"draft\" should be moved to the drafts folder.\n\nWhat I've tried so far is to make a folder action that does this but it sends those files to the folder originally writen in the folder action. If I make a folder action that sends .psd files to the Photoshop folder into \"Project 1\", then that action to the next folder \"Project 2\" will still send those files to the Photoshop folder in \"Project 1\", instead of in \"Project 2\".\nAny suggestions on how to do this?\n\nA: Here is a way to go about achieving the goal. (It is not the only way to achieve the goal.)\nFirst I'd make a placeholder template Folder Action using Automator and after creating it, disable it in Folder Action Setup, but leave the workflow available where it gets saved. This will be opened at the end of creating a new project folder to then be assigned to it and saved as its name, thus leaving the placeholder template Folder Action available for the next new project folder.\nThe images of the two workflows are placed at the bottom so as to make the answer easier to read.\nYou will need to add to the example shell script code, as all of the conditions were not expressed in your question.\n\n\nPlaceholder template Folder Action\nExample shell script code:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n    # f = fully qualified pathname\n    # d = directory pathname\n    # fn = filename with extension\n    # n = filename without extension\n    # e = filename extension\n\nshopt -s nocasematch\n\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n\n    d=\"${f%/*}\"\n    fn=\"${f##*/}\"\n    # n=\"${fn%.*}\"\n    e=\"${fn##*.}\"\n\n    cd \"${d}\" || exit\n    [ -w \"${d}\" ] || exit\n\n    [[ ${e} == jpg ]] && mv -n \"${f}\" './Images/'\n    [[ ${e} == psd ]] && mv -n \"${f}\" './Photoshop/'\n    [[ ${fn} =~ draft ]] && mv -n \"${f}\" './Drafts/'\n\n    [ -f \"${f}\" ] && mkdir -p 'Other'; mv -n \"${f}\" './Other/'\n\n done\n\nNote: The last test before done handles any case not already defined. Obviously you can choose not to use it and remove it from the example shell script code.\n\n\nCreate New Project Folder Structure\nFor an Automator workflow to create the new project folder, use the screenshot of the following workflow:\nThe example shell script code of the Run Shell Script action is:\nmkdir \"$1/$2\" || exit\ncd \"$1/$2\" || exit\nmkdir 'After Effects' 'Assets' 'Audition' 'Drafts' 'Excel' 'Final' 'Fonts' 'Illustrator' 'Images' 'Photoshop' 'Premier' 'Word'\n\nopen \"${HOME}/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions/Foobar.workflow\"\n\nNote: Change the name of the Folder Action workflow in the example shell script code from Foobar.workflow to whatever its actual name is.\nAlso note in the image below of the Create New Project Folder Structure workflow how there are logical breaks between some of the actions and in the end the value of the two variables are separate from the rest of the workflow. While the workflow shown in the question works, nonetheless, in my opinion this is a better way of doing it as it breaks the workflow into logical action blocks, which makes it easier to follow/understand what the workflow is doing.\nTechnically the Create New Project Folder Structure workflow only needs one variable and it could be structured as, e.g:\n\n*\n\n*Ask For Text action\n\n*set Value of Variable action\n\n*\n\n*Variable: [New Project]\n\n\n\n*Ask for Finder Items action\n\n*\n\n*[Optons] [√] Ignore this action's input\n\n\n\n*Get Value of Variable action\n\n*\n\n*Variable: [New Project]\n\n\n\n*Run Shell Script action\nWhile this does work and has less actions than what's show in the question, nonetheless, as I mentioned earlier about logical action blocks within the workflow which makes it easier to follow/understand what the workflow is doing.\n\n\nFolder Action Setup\nFolder Action Setup can be used to work with as needed any Folder Action created.\nFolder Action Setup can be opened using Spotlight by pressing ⌘ Space and start typing its name, then once selected, press Enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Here is a different approach which does not use Automator.\nThis following AppleScript code, in short, prompts you to choose a name for your new Art Project and where to create the Project and its directories.\nAfter the Project’s directories structure has been created, a new Folder Action will then be automatically created, saved, and attached to your new Project folder.\nThe only thing that really needs to be done is to edit some of the values in the script object script artProjectsFileProcessor. This is the part of the code which tells the Folder Action what to do with the files that get added to the Project folder.

Does updating in DFU mode authenticate apple ID  ?\nOR\nit's(not asking passcode and not going in data recovery step) because of trying updating phone for 4-5 times ?\nRegards\n\nA: If you change the Apple ID password and one device has the correct password and the other device does not have the correct password then the device without the correct password will fail to authenticate until you change the saved password on that device.\nUpdating an Apple device in recovery DFU mode is typically performed via Apple Configurator 2 or perhaps iTunes on Windows.  You do not need to authenticate to Apple to load iOS / iPadOS / macOS via Apple Configurator.  You will need to authenticate on the device itself.  If you are using an MDM or Configuration Profiles on Apple Configurator you can configure the device to login to a particular Apple ID.\nUPDATED After question edited:\nAlways backup your iPhone. iCloud backup is the easiest no brainer way to backup.  If you don't have enough storage you can upgrade iCloud storage to 50GB's by paying $1/mo. or $3/mo. for 200GB or $10/mo for 2TB of storage. Storage plans of 200GB+ are eligible for family sharing. An iCloud backup may be deleted after 180 days if it's not updated by the device that created it.\nAlternative to iCloud backup is to backup to a PC with iTunes or a Mac. A backup to a computer is a complete backup while an iCloud backup is only your data and settings. But you do need to remember to actually backup the iPhone with this method where iCloud is completely automatic once you turn the feature on.\nIf you had either an iCloud or full backup made on a computer, you would have been able to wipe out the iPhone entirely and restore from iCloud during the activation process (after logging on with the correct Apple ID password). Or after imaging the iPhone during DFU and backup restoration you would be prompted for the Apple ID and password.\nIf Erase Data is turned on under Settings -> Passcode (TouchID / FaceID) then it will self-erase after 10 failed password attempts to unlock the iPhone.  It will pause after a few attempts and disable the iPhone to prevent you from continuously attempting to guess the password.  The timeout increases exponentially every time you continue to fail to unlock the iPhone.  At the 10th and final failure it would have taken over and hour to get to that point. If the 10th time you fail it will factory reset itself.\nDuring initial operating system activation it will prompt for the Apple ID & Password.  This is called Activation Lock. It is an anti-theft feature. If you don't know your password you can reset the password via https://appleid.apple.com and after a few minutes it should work providing the iPhone was connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data.\nIn order to clear the Activation Lock the owner needs to remove the device from the iCloud account via icloud.com. This will clear the prompt for the Activation lock within a few minutes providing the iPhone is online via Wi-Fi / Cellular.\nIf you fully lockout your Apple ID then you need to call Apple Support to get it unlocked.\nIn the upcoming iOS 15 there is a feature to add a friend or relative to help validate your identity if you are locked out of your Apple ID.  A code will be sent to your friend or family member who can then give you the code verbally and then using that code you will be able to unlock your account.  This was added because in some instances recovery was not possible and users had to create a new Apple ID.  Another feature was added where you can designate a beneficiary of sorts who upon your death will be granted access to your Apple account. I believe you must provide an official death certificate but the designee would then be able to access the device.\nWhat should your next steps be?\nBACKUP YOUR IPHONE\nEither to iCloud or via USB Lightning cable to PC with iTunes or a Mac and performing a full backup.\nFirst try going to Settings -> General -> Reset -> Erase all Settings and Content.  When the iPhone reboots see if you can update to the latest iOS version.  If this again fails you will require a PC or Mac so you can put the iPhone in DFU mode and reload iOS from scratch over the USB lightning cable.  At that point, it should be the latest iOS version.  During device activation, restore from iCloud.  Restoring from the full backup on PC / Mac would likely result it being restored back to the older iOS version.  So iCloud is really necessary to fix your particular scenario. Otherwise you may restore the problem.  If you don't use iCloud much the 5GB of free storage might be just enough to hold one backup (if you are lucky). If not then you must purchase additional storage.  The 50GB storage plan is plenty.\n", "Q: AppleScript - Can't get rid of delay after click I'm very new to scripting and using AppleScript. I'm on MacOS 10.14. I have been messing around with it making a few scripts to automate clicking Apple and 3rd-party menu bar items.\nI have the following script written that clicks a certain menu bar item, presses the down arrow key and presses the return key.\nThe problem is, the click seems to be creating a 5-6 second delay before the key presses can fire. I searched for a solution but only found a couple posts talking about the issue. They both said the solution is to wrap the click command in ignoring application responses and end ignoring statements, however that doesn't seem to solve the problem for me.\nI also looked up the delay command and tried specifying a delay of 1 second, but that didn't work either. It just adds another second of delay to the already-existing 5-6 second delay.\nThe code I've got is:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Enjoyable\"\n        click (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2)\n        key code 125\n        key code 36\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nWith the ignore statements, I've written:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Enjoyable\"\n        ignoring application responses\n            click (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2)\n        end ignoring\n        key code 125\n        key code 36\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nWith the delay statement, I've written:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Enjoyable\"\n        click (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2)\n        delay 1\n        key code 125\n        key code 36\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nWhat other options could I try to get rid of the delay between the click and the key presses?\n\nA: The example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested three different ways, run in Script Editor, run as a standalone  AppleScript application, and run as an Automator Service/Quick Action under macOS Mojave with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate setting in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nExample AppleScript code:\nignoring application responses\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        click menu bar item 1 of ¬\n            menu bar 2 of ¬\n            application process \"Enjoyable\"\nend ignoring\n\ndelay 0.1\ndo shell script \"killall 'System Events'\"\ndelay 0.2\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    launch\n    click menu item 1 of ¬\n        menu 1 of ¬\n        menu bar item 1 of ¬\n        menu bar 2 of ¬\n        application process \"Enjoyable\"\nend tell\n\n\nNotes:\nUsing Accessibility Inspector, a part of Xcode, it reveals there is no action assigned to menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of application process \"Enjoyable\" and is probably why it hangs with the original code, how you tried it.\nTo work around the 5 ~ 6 seconds delay using ignoring application responses I wrapped the first tell application \"System Events\" command with just a single task to perform, which allowed the script to proceed, and then killing the System Events application process allows the second tell application \"System Events\" command to perform its tasks with the minimal delay of ~1 second combined for the running of the whole script. This is of course much better than the 5 ~ 6 seconds delay without doing it in this manner.\nThe very small delay commands before and after the do shell script \"killall 'System Events'\" command are to allow time for the menu bar item to show its menu and for System Events to terminate before calling it again to click the target menu item. The value of the delay command may need to be slightly adjusted and if so do as necessary.\nAs previously mentioned, this worked for me without issue1, however, if for some reason the example AppleScript code, shown above, does not work for you, then here is a programatic way to click the target menu bar item on the menu bar using either the cliclick or MouseTools third-party utility.\n\n*\n\n*I have cliclick and MouseTools located in /usr/local/bin/, so change it in the code if you have them located elsewhere.\n\n\n\nUsing: cliclick\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    set thePositionSizeList to ¬\n        the {position, size} of ¬\n            menu bar item 1 of ¬\n            menu bar 2 of ¬\n            application process \"Enjoyable\"\n\nset xPos to ¬\n    (item 1 of item 1 of thePositionSizeList) + ¬\n    (item 1 of item 2 of thePositionSizeList) / 2 ¬\n    as integer\n\nset yPos to ¬\n    (item 2 of item 1 of thePositionSizeList) + ¬\n    (item 2 of item 2 of thePositionSizeList) / 2 ¬\n    as integer\n\nset shellCMD to {¬\n    \"/usr/local/bin/cliclick -r c:\", ¬\n    xPos, \",\", yPos, \" w:50 c:\", ¬\n    xPos, \",\", (yPos + 22)} as string\n\ndo shell script shellCMD\n\nNotes:\nWith cliclick one can string multiple events together and why the code ends at the do shell script shellCMD command as it clicks both the menu bar item and the menu item, especially since it's the first menu item being targeted.\ncliclick is available as a precompiled binary executable, source code, and also can be installed using Homebrew.\nThe current precompiled binary executable release of cliclick (5.0) will not run on macOS Mojave and I used an older version I already had (Version 4.0.1, released 2018-04-10). If you cannot acquire an earlier version you can use MouseTools instead.\n\n\nUsing: MouseTools\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    set thePositionSizeList to ¬\n        the {position, size} of ¬\n            menu bar item 1 of ¬\n            menu bar 2 of ¬\n            application process \"Enjoyable\"\n\nset xPos to ¬\n    (item 1 of item 1 of thePositionSizeList) + ¬\n    (item 1 of item 2 of thePositionSizeList) / 2 ¬\n    as integer\n\nset yPos to ¬\n    (item 2 of item 1 of thePositionSizeList) + ¬\n    (item 2 of item 2 of thePositionSizeList) / 2 ¬\n    as integer\n\nset shellCMD to {¬\n    \"/usr/local/bin/MouseTools -x \", ¬\n    xPos, \" -y \", yPos, \" -leftClick\"} as string\n\ndo shell script shellCMD\n\ndelay 0.2\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click menu item 1 of ¬\n        menu 1 of ¬\n        menu bar item 1 of ¬\n        menu bar 2 of ¬\n        application process \"Enjoyable\"\n\n\nNotes:\nWith MouseTools one can only perform one event at a time and why after clicking the menu bar item on the menu bar I just switched back to using System Events to click the target menu item, vs. calling MouseTools a second time, either within the first do shell script command or a second do shell script command possibly after a short delay.\nFor example, you could change the shellCMD to:\nset shellCMD to {¬\n    \"/usr/local/bin/MouseTools -x \", ¬\n    xPos, \" -y \", yPos, \" -leftClick;\", ¬\n    \"/usr/local/bin/MouseTools -x \", ¬\n    xPos, \" -y \", (yPos + 22), \" -leftClick\"} as string \n\nThen remove everything after the do shell script command.\nMouseTools is available as a precompiled binary executable and source code.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: There is another option, although it only applies to people using the Bartender application (https://www.macbartender.com).\nBartender itself has support for some basic AppleScript commands and one of those commands is the activate command:\nactivate v : Will Show and Activate a menu bar item, you must provide menu item ID, these can be found via the list menu bar items command\n  activate MIID text : The menu bar item ID to activate\n    [with text]\n\nThe activate command is the equivalent of the click action from System Events.\nTo obtain the ID of the item that you wish to activate you use the list menu bar items command:\nlist menu bar items v : List current menu bar item IDs, so you know what to use for the activate and show commands\n  list menu bar items\n    → text : the IDs of the menu bar items\n\nThe ID doesn't seem to change, so all you need to do is obtain the ID manually once and then simply use it in your AppleScript like so:\ntell application \"Bartender 4\"\n    activate \"org.openvpn.client.app-Item-1\"\nend tell\n\n-- now you can click on any menu item\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"OpenVPN Connect\" to tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2    \n    try\n        click menu item \"Disconnect\" of menu 1\n\n(... script cut off)\n\nI my case I was scripting the OpenVPN Connect application (https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/).\nI hope this information helps someone who uses the Bartender application but didn't think to go through the Bartender API.\n", "Q: Finder - Keyboard shortcut to rename file In Windows File Explorer, you can rename a selected file by pressing F2.

I have hundreds of gigabytes of files that I manually (tried) to delete from an external hard drive. However I can't empty my trash, and no space has freed up on the drive.\nWhen I try to empty my trash, I get an error saying that I can't, because some of the files are locked, or in use or I don't have permission. The Macos popup tells me I should manually locate and change the permissions of the offending file.\nHere's the problem, there are 10s of thousands of files, so that is not realistic.\nWhat hasn't worked:\nPutting sudo rm -R into my command line and dragging the offensive trash into my terminal.\nSelecting trash files in question, clicking \"get info\" and unlocking them still doesn't let me right click and delete immediately.\nRestarting my computer hasn't helped either. When I reconnect the drive, I still have no space freed and the junk files are still living in my trash folder... unable to be removed.\nAs things are now, I've exhausted all available solutions to reclaim this space on my drive.\nMy setup:\nMacbook air, up to date with Big Sur 11.4\n\nA: Let's assume the name of the drive is /Volumes/External/ for the sake of discussion.\nGo into Terminal and type:\nsudo find \"/Volumes/External/.Trashes/$EUID\" -depth -mindepth 1 -print\n\nThat should show you all of the files in your Trash on the external drive.\nIf you want to try deleting them, try this:\nsudo find \"/Volumes/External/.Trashes/$EUID\" -depth -mindepth 1 -print -delete\n\nNote: Be careful. Mistyping this command can do serious damage since you are deleting files using sudo. The -print command by itself is safe. Once you add -delete then you are deleting files.\nUse at your own risk.\n\nA: Get Info on the external drive & check the box marked \"Ignore ownership on this volume\"\nThen all you have to deal with are any files in use or locked, which can usually be dealt with by a reboot.\n\nA: I had the same problem today and here is what I did after failing to find any helpful information on the issue. I followed the instructions here on enabling the root user:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012\nI then logged out, and back in as root by selecting \"Other\" on the login screen and typing in \"root\" for the user and my new password.\nI tried to use the terminal to delete the files, but that failed and just refused to do it. Then I tried to delete them in the Finder, which worked! Annoying. I went back to the terminal and the files seemed to now be visible, so I used rm -r just for good measure and they went away. I don't know if that part was critical or some file system issue.\nNote that I had to first use Finder to navigate to my regular user home by turning on the path bar in the View menu, then clicking on my drive, then the Users directory, then my regular user directory. Then, showing that directory in Finder, I used the Go To Folder option on the Go menu and typed in \".Trash\" which, unlike the Terminal, showed me all of the files in the trash! I didn't expect Finder to have abilities that the terminal lacked.\nI then selected the troublesome files and used Command-Delete to delete them. I actually decided to totally clear the trash since I was making a backup bootable clone and didn't want to copy all of this trash there.\nI'm making my clone now and it seems to be OK. The reason I went down this rabbit hole was because I tried to install a music app and it failed and I deleted it, and the \"bad\" files ended up in the trash.\nI'm just a developer and not an OS expert and I don't understand why this is happening. I've been doing searches to find a detailed explanation, but have had no luck so far. The problem never showed itself before upgrading to Big Sur and I've had a number of issues where some low level driver type files, that do not come through the App Store installers, if that matters, are getting wedged into the file system and not always behaving correctly.\nFor example, I've had both Carbon Copy Cloner and Little Snitch have problems where the solution was to boot into single user mode and track down a locked file or directory and delete it, then reinstall or upgrade the app to get it working. I've got a few other app doing something similar and I'm not sure what's causing it. I think the music app I tried had the same problem. There seems to be some kind of situation where some program components are installed as \"locked\" but this causes problems in the normal execution of the apps. (See the sparse docs on the uchg file flags, which is all very obscure to me.)\nThe worse thing is that not everybody has this issue. The support folks at some app companies have told me that it is only a handful of users seeing this. I don't know why, and suspect it related to my 2015 model being upgraded again and again as new OS releases get installed. Plus, I have a lot of developer tools installed and they sometimes install weird things under the hood.\nI don't really know why, but this managed to get me going. Read the docs about the root user in full before you try this, they warn against doing this.\n", "Q: Beware: macOS Finder \"Connect to Server\" accepts FTPS URLs (FTP in a SSL/TLS tunnel) but actually connects via plain FTP!

If it is not, you will never reach loginwindow and Finder. There are a number of reasons why DSMOS isn't completing. Two of the more common ones are:\n\n*\n\n*Your filesystem has some corruption that occasionally is within the critical path to the DSMOS mechanism. The immediate next step would be to boot into Recovery mode and run Disk First Aid to check (& repair) your boot volume.\n\n*The SMC may be getting to a bad state from time to time and failing to read the DSMOS key or pass it to the OS. An SMC reset may fix this.\n\n", "Q: What is ~/.local directory tree and two executables there?

Do various apps just dump files there?\n\nIn particular, I can recognize traces of some apps there, namely, aws (command line interface to Amazon Web Services) and rstudio. But what led me to ask about this, besides now finding ~/.local in my $PATH are two executables in ~/.local/bin, namely, alex and happy.\n\n*\n\n*What are these two executables?\n\nA: \nIn the .local hierarchy, programs put user information such as emails and calendar events. You could manually remove this data, but then the program would lose its state\n\n\n.local is for storing user program data (like locally installed programs), not user data (like photos, calendars etc)\n\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/14536/168071\n\nA: ~/.local is an attempt to provide a standard place to store executables and data for applications ported from Linux.

I have about 25 of those, like ~/.dropbox and ~/.julia.  And even worse the apps that just put configuration files in ~ like the Apple supplied zsh.\nRather like all the stuff in ~/Library (the Apple standard location) it is best to ignore these folders and just assume that the developers know what they are doing!\n[Is this an answer or a rant?]\n", "Q: \"Your system has run out of application memory.\" chrome using over 100 gb My computer was being very slow and then I got an error that my system is running out of application memory.

I want to know if I everything is installed correctly as I see python in 3 different directories. If not I want to uninstall them and I want to know which one not to touch.\n\nA: MacOS comes with python2, which is installed in /usr/bin.\nFrom Catalina onward, macOS also comes with a 'stub' for python3, which is also in /usr/bin.\nThe first time you run this, it will ask to install the Xcode Command Line Tools, which contain python3, if you don't have Xcode installed already.\n/usr/bin just contains the 'command': the libraries and meat of the installation is in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework. You can't delete the system pythons without doing all sorts of tricks, so if you can delete it, it's not the system one.\n/usr/bin is restricted to system software only. Third-party installations will be in /usr/local, though I believe homebrew also uses /opt.\nSo anything in /usr/local will be a third-party python. The 'meat' of the package is usually installed in /Library/Frameworks/.  \"If you can delete it, it's not system installed.\"\nUnless you intend to install and use multiple pythons at the same time, I find using the python installer directly from https://www.python.org/downloads/ to be much easier than Homebrew, which seems to complicate matters. (Others may disagree.)\n\nA: MacOS comes with preinstalled versions of Python (which depend upon the version of MacOS you have). It is important not to change or remove these as there are going to be other application or system dependencies on them.\nI used the Homebrew installation to install Python 3.9.5. This install is missing a couple of steps (likely by design) which you will need to do afterwards. Try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Edit your shell e.g. .zshrc to update the PATH to find the correct versions of Python and it's dependencies e.g. add \"export PATH=/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:/Users/java/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH\"\n\n\n*Install the tk dependency so you can run IDLE from the command line e.g.\ntype \"brew install python-tk\"\nResults from a current installation of Homebrew followed by steps 1 & 2 above should be similar to below:\njava@Tests-iMac ~ % which python\n/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin/python\njava@Tests-iMac ~ % python --version\nPython 3.9.5\njava@Tests-iMac ~ % which pip\n/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin/pip\njava@Tests-iMac ~ % pip --version\npip 21.1.2 from /Users/java/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages/pip (python 3.9)\njava@Tests-iMac ~ %\n\n", "Q: Is there a shortcut to undo MacOS's spell check correction without completely disabling it?

My MacBook (Big Sur) has a problem about once a week when it stops being able to access the internet. Why do I think this is a problem with the Wifi processes? When I go up to the Wifi symbol in the top bar (the one that shows the signal strength), if I try to turn off the Wifi with the slider it just ignores it and keeps showing full signal strength (not greying them out). Trying to select another Wifi router just ends up with it spinning, more fiddling eventually makes the machine hang. The only solution I've found is restarting the laptop, but that takes forever as every app running refuses to restart until it's been able to talk to the network (that isn't there). Eventually it says my computer restarted because of a problem. It's not the router as other laptops are fine, they keep running, it's just this one.\nSo I'm hoping to find a way to avoid a full restart - is there a way to kill the processes that handle the Wifi?\np.s. someone already asked this question, but no-one answered it exactly, they gave an answer on how to type something in the terminal to turn the wifi off and then on again. I've tried that, the command doesn't complete - the command just hangs forever, and even control-C doesn't bring it back.\n\nA: Killing running processes often makes things worse since they don’t save files and preferences and cause corruption. If you had bad hardware or drivers, there’s slim chance things would work for a week.\nSadly, you may have to triage this a bit to understand what happens in the 30 minutes before a hang happens. The things you are doing to “maintain” the system are highly likely to be the cause of the hang, and not the cure in my experience.\nLogging out each night and let the computer run should prove the wifi is stable and this is a user app issue or memory leak / corruption issue.\n\nA: That sounds super frustrating, I’m sorry to hear that. I don’t have any suggestions on how to solve the Wi-Fi issue. I have two suggestions on things you can try when it happens.\n\n*\n\n*When you need to reboot, go to Terminal and type sudo shutdown -r now (and enter your admin password when prompted) and it should reboot faster. I realize it’s not a “solution” but in the meantime it may help reduce some of the frustration associated with it.\n\n\n*You could also try setting up a separate location with no devices:\nGo to System Preferences » Network:\n\nClick the “Location” dropdown:\n\nChoose “Edit Locations…”\n\nClick the + which will create a new location.\n\nName the new location “Airplane Mode” (or whatever):\n\nSelect all of the devices (See #1 and #3)\n\nand click the — after each (#2 and #4) to remove them all.\nOnce they are all gone, click “Apply”.\nOnce you have more than one location defined, there will be a new \"Location\" menu which you can use to switch between them.\n\nMost of the time you will want to stay on \"Automatic\" but try the \"Airplane Mode\" when the Wi-Fi flakes out.\nIt's not a fix. But it might help mitigate the problem in the meantime.\n", "Q: How to fix FFFF-FFF partition \nI wanted to create a dualboot setup on my Macbook Pro so that I could run Big Sur along with High Sierra.

But I am looking for a way to do this from the command line. For example I have a monitoring script running that knows if I am using battery or not. I'd love to toggle the battery icon off when connected via AC power and back on when using battery power.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: To toggle the showing of the Wi-Fi and Battery Status icons on the Menu Bar from the command line in Terminal, one can use a shell script to do so, as in the example AppleScript code used as a shell script, presented below.\nThe core parts of the example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested in Script Editor, and the entire script as a executable shell script in Terminal, under macOS Catalina and with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1 Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\n\n*The example AppleScript code presented herein works as tested in macOS Catalina, however, will need to be modified for use in macOS Big Sur or later.\n\nGeneral Notes:\nIn macOS Catalina when the Menu Extras that show on the Menu Bar are showing, it's the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist file that contains an entry under the menuExtras key for those that show. If they are not showing, then the entry is removed from the target .plist file.\nWhile one can use the defaults command line utility, or the /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy command line utility to modify the target .plist file, nonetheless, even after killing the SystemUIServer process, it does not reflect the current state of the modified target .plist file. As such, one can use AppleScript with UI Scripting and System Events to modify System Preferences to remove the target Menu Extras from the Menu Bar. To show them, it's not as complicated as removing them and it's just a matter of opening the target Menu Extras.\nThe Menu Extras are located at: /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/\nBelow you'll find two separate AppleScript scripts that will toggle the state of the Wi-Fi and Battery Status icons shown on the Menu Bar. They will be available for use from Terminal, or other methods of calling a command line utility.\nSystem Preferences will not show its UI, however, its Dock icon will bounce briefly one time when removing the target icons from the menu bar. (It's barely noticeable.)\n\n*\n\n*Note that after creating and testing the executable shell script for each, they should be moved to a directory that is included in the PATH passed to the shell so they can be used by just typing their name without the leading ./, or their fully qualified pathname.\n\n\n\nWi-Fi Menu Bar Icon\nTo use the example AppleScript code as an executable shell script in Terminal, run the following compound command in Terminal:\nf='wifimbi'; touch \"$f\"; open -e \"$f\"; chmod +x \"$f\"\n\nIn the opened wifimbi document, copy and paste the example AppleScript code into it, then save and close it.\nBack in Terminal, type ./wifimbi and then press enter:\nIt should output:\nMissing argument, e.g.,: wifimbi [on|off]\n\nMeaning to use it you type either wifimbi on or wifimbi off to add to remove the Wi-Fi icon from the menu bar.\nThen test it using ./wifimbi on and ./wifimbi off, however, do not run the commands immediately back to back as it takes a few moments for the script to run and the target .plist file to update.\nExample AppleScript code:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\non run argv\n    \n    if argv is equal to {} then ¬\n        return \"Missing argument, e.g.,: \" & ¬\n            name of me & \" [on|off]\"\n    \n    set thePropertyListFilePath to ¬\n        the POSIX path of ¬\n            (path to preferences from user domain as string) & ¬\n        \"com.apple.systemuiserver.plist\"\n    \n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        tell the property list file thePropertyListFilePath to ¬\n            set menuExtrasListAsString to the value of ¬\n                the property list item ¬\n                    \"menuExtras\" as string\n    \n    if argv is {\"on\"} and ¬\n        menuExtrasListAsString does not contain \"Airport\" then\n        do shell script ¬\n            \"open -g '/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Airport.menu'\"\n        return \"The Wi-Fi menu bar icon is now showing...\"\n    else if argv is {\"on\"} and ¬\n        menuExtrasListAsString contains \"Airport\" then\n        return \"The Wi-Fi menu bar icon is already showing...\"\n    else if argv is {\"off\"} and ¬\n        menuExtrasListAsString contains \"Airport\" then\n        my toggleMenuExtras()\n        return \"The Wi-Fi menu bar icon is no longer showing...\"\n    else if argv is {\"off\"} and ¬\n        menuExtrasListAsString does not contain \"Airport\" then\n        return \"The Wi-Fi menu bar icon is already not showing...\"\n    end if\n    \nend run\n\n\n--  ## Handler ##\n\non toggleMenuExtras()\n    \n    --  # Check to see if System Preferences is \n    --  # running and if yes, then close it.\n    --  # \n    --  # This is done so the script will not fail \n    --  # if it is running and a modal sheet is \n    --  # showing, hence the use of 'killall' \n    --  # as 'quit' fails when done so, if it is.\n    --  #\n    --  # This is also done to allow default behaviors\n    --  # to be predictable from a clean occurrence.\n    \n    if running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n        try\n            tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n        on error\n            do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\"\n        end try\n        delay 0.1\n    end if\n    \n    --  # Make sure System Preferences is not running before\n    --  # opening it again.

While it did check it, it would only stick if the UI of System Preferences was made visible, which of course would somewhat defeat the purpose of doing this from the command line.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: I don't know of any way to remove menu bar items programmatically. (I think you can add them by opening the corresponding .menu files that are tucked away somewhere in the file system.\nI can offer you a possible work-around for the battery at least:\nSlimBatteryMonitor is a free app that can show a different icon when on battery or charging, and can show none when charged. (It does still leave a tiny blank icon in the menu bar area.)\nIf no one else comes up with an idea, at least that's something to get you started.\n", "Q: Fix/restore \"Print to PDF\" to preset location in Big Sur Recently updated to Big Sur.  Previously in Catalina (and prior) I was able to open a print dialog box, select the PDF drop down and choose a preset folder I had saved (Dropbox/Receipts folder) where macOS would then generate a PDF of whatever I was trying to print and drop it into that folder.\n~/Library/PDF Services still has this folder alias but when I select it to \"print\" to, there is no PDF file generated.\nI've read some stuff about PDF Services changing in Big Sur but no conclusive answer how to bring back this essential function where I can print anything to PDF to a preset folder with like 3 clicks.\n\nA: My diagnosis:\nWhen I print with Save to any folder not in my home folder nothing appears in the destination.  So this is not a Dropbox issue.\nThe Console log includes this:\nerror   09:04:57.913422+1000    kernel  Sandbox: printtool(7104) deny(1) file-write-create /Volumes/T5/Sync/Dropbox/folder/file.pdf\nerror   09:04:57.914103+1000    printtool   #print Failed to run workflow (-108)\n\nSo this is a sandbox issue with the printtool process.\nWorkaround 1:\nThis workaround (which fails so far) is an attempt to enable printtool to avoid the sandbox. For this we can add the printtool executable to Full Disk Access in Security & Privacy. The path to add is:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/PrintCore.framework/Versions/A/printtool.\n\nBut this is does not work (even after a reboot)!! Perhaps another step is needed.\nWorkaround 2:\nMy other workarounds avoid using the print processing to write the PDF. This is rather clumsy but works.  In the print dialog choose Save as PDF and save to the Dropbox folder.\nWorkaround 3:\nAutomate the processing, using a local folder for printing and some automatic processing to move the PDF where we want in Dropbox.\n\n*\n\n*In PDF Services add an alias to a folder which is under the home directory. I used ~/Documents/DropboxPrint with an alias renamed to Save to Dropbox. Printing to that will work.\n\n\n*Either:\nFor the folder chosen create a Folder Action and script to move the PDF to Dropbox, or (slightly easier) create rule in Hazel to move the file to a folder (e.g. called Print) inside Dropbox.\n\nThis works because we have avoided the restrictions on printtool and used Hazel which already has Full Disk Access.\n\nA: UPDATE: This problem is fixed in Monterey, which restores writing permissions to PDF Services. The solution is thus to update beyond Big Sur.\n\nThe problem is that as of Big Sur, PDF Services has been massively sandboxed so as to render it useless.\nerror   09:33:50.180022+0100    kernel  Sandbox: printtool(5086) deny(1) file-write-create /Users/Shared/Print/Out/big sur - Fix-restore \"Print to PDF\" to preset location in Big Sur - Ask Different.pdf\n\n.\nThe only thing I have found that works is an Automator Application (nb: not 'workflow' or anything else). Presumably, applications have local code-signing or something that lets them through the sandbox. So you will need to create an Automator sequence that saves the file to your destination.\nThe problem also affects executables, like shell and python scripts. Automator Print plug-ins no longer work either.\n\nRelax the sandbox\nHowever, this sandboxing can be 'fixed' by adding the words Sandboxing Relaxed to /etc/cups/cups-files.conf. You can do this from within the CUPS web front-end (Administation tab > Edit Configuration File button), or just with Terminal or with BBEdit etc. You'll need to restart cupsd if you don't use the web front-end.\nThis seems to allow printtool a bit more freedom, but the executables it calls are still subjected to various restrictions.\nPlease 'send feedback' to Apple.\n", "Q: Can I share files between my Macbook Air and my Windows 10 PC with a usb-c adapter?

Since it's moving between volumes, the Finder will make a copy rather than moving it. I'd recommend leaving the copy on the external drive until you're sure everything came over ok.\n(Note: since a symbolic link can look a lot like the thing it points to, I wanted to make sure it's just a symbolic link rather than an actual folder before throwing it out.)\nJust for neatness, I'd also recommend fixing the permissions on the restored Documents folder with these commands:\nchmod 300 ~/Documents\nchmod +a \"group:everyone deny delete\" ~/Documents\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Delete the symlink\nrm ~/Documents\n\n\n\n*Move the folder back\nmv \"/Volumes/MEMOREX USB/Documents\" ~/Documents\n\nMove and copy files in Terminal on Mac - Apple Support\n", "Q: How do I stop File Sharing of volumes I did not share?

It's moving slowly, but it's definitely moving. It's a 3.4 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3, plenty of free disk space - 1.76TB.\n\n*I have most important stuff on the MBP backed up, but concerned due to medical reasons that vital things may not have been backed up in recent times - my eye has been off the ball somewhat...\n\n*I really want to access the Data on the MBP if I possibly can.\n\n*I fear the Logic Board might be on it's way, but hope I can salvage something.\n\nWhat I've Tried Already\n\n\n*Updated iMac to HS, to create bootable installer of High Sierra using Terminal commands. It's Extended Volume, not AFPS.  Can make another in AFPS if it will remotely help.\n\n*MBP did not boot to it.  Still brings up Network prompt which ultimately seems to cause the fail each time.\n\n*MBP appears to process connecting the MBP to WiFi Network each time, but then produces variety of error codes at the end, even when using bootable installer and Option key.\n12 Have even put entire High Sierra OS on external drive, endeavouring to effectively use external drive as a Mac Mini with ailing MBP just the screen.  Nope.  Still wants to connect to to Network (this is for the Firmware, afaik?)\n\n*Have today connected MBP to iMac using Thunderbolt 3 cable and USB-C to Thunderbolt adaptor.\n\n*Endeavouring to boot using Target Disk Mode.\n\n*Can see MBP Macintosh HD - Data in Disk Utility, but cannot perform First Aid, nor Mount it.

To make the USB bootable installer you need the Install macOS Big Sur application. Using my iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) with macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6 installed, I created this installer by using the following steps.\n\n*\n\n*Download the InstallAssistant.pkg directly from Apple. I used the Apple URL http://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/55/59/071-00696-A_4T69TQR1VO/9psvjmwyjlucyg708cqjeaiylrvb0xph94/InstallAssistant.pkg\n\n\n*Use the Finder application to open the InstallAssistant.pkg with the Installer application.\n\n\n*Proceed to install the InstallAssistant. This will create the Install macOS Big Sur application in the Applications folder\n\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application to erase a 16 GB USB-A 3.0 flash drive. Choose the following settings.\n\n\n\n*Execute the following command in a Terminal application window. The will create the bootable Big Sur USB-A flash drive installer.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Big\\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\n\nNote: To plug the flash drive into a 2018 MBP would require the proper USB-C to USB-A Adaptor. For example, this adaptor from Belkin.\n\nReferences\nmacOS Big Sur Full Installer Database.

I am switching from a 2018 MBP i7 with a touch bar to a 2020 MBP M1. The older machine is still running macOS Catalina (v10.15.7) whereas the newer one came with macOS Big Sur preinstalled (v11.4). One thing I cannot figure out is how to force the M1 to show the function keys immediately upon pressing the  fn key. Check out the different Keyboard system preferences:\n2018\n\n2020\n\nVideo\nClick here to see the difference in a video.\nThis delay is big enough for me to miss the  fncontrolF2 or  fncontrolF3 shortcuts that focus on the Menu Bar and Dock, respectively. While I realize that I have the option to show nothing but the function keys on the touch bar, I still find the touch bar useful enough to leave it as is. (I've set it up to change to function keys in certain apps like iTerm.)\nDoes anybody know of a script or a workaround how to bring back the macOS Catalina behavior?\n\nA: The only workaround that I know of is to choose Do Nothing under Press .\nThis would disable the short-press functionality and it will skip straight to the Press and Hold functionality.\n\nA: To solve the immediate issue at hand, set the \"Press …\" to \"Do Nothing:\"\n\n\nHowever, I still wanted to be able to tap  fn twice to start dictation. I was able to re-enable that functionality with the help of a third-party app called BetterTouchTool. Here's how:\n\n*\n\n*In Preferences » Keyboard » Dictation, create a custom shortcut:\n\n(I used ^⌥⌘clear, but it doesn't really matter)\n\n\n*In BetterTouchTool, record a new Key Sequence for  fn fn and assign the Action to \" Send Keyboard Shortcut\" to match the shortcut from the previous step:\n\n\nA: This is unique to new Mac models\nThis difference is due to your hardware having the globe key (see bold):\n\nTo show the function keys in the Touch Bar, press and hold the Fn key or the Globe key  (depending on your Mac model) on the keyboard.\n\nOlder Macs still display the same options on Big Sur.\nWhy there’s a delay\nThe delay is necessary given that this key also functions as a way to switch keyboards (holding vs. pressing).\nPotential workarounds\n\n*\n\n*Try to only have 1 keyboard available (hopefully it skips the delay in this case)?\n\n*Try something like what was suggested on a related question:\n\n\nI solved the issue with this program:\nhttps://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/\nAnd imported this:\nhttps://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#fn_plus_numbers_to_function_keys\n\n", "Q: How can I fix my Mac volume glitching?

The issue doesn't happen there. But, I can't boot into Windows using the selector tool (hold alt on startup), so instead, I need to boot into recovery mode and then select it as the startup disk. Normal macOS doesn't recognise the Windows drive either. This may be related to the issue.\nI don't think it's a third-party app, but I used AppCleaner to uninstall all my audio utilities and my most recent installations.\nIs there a solution? Thanks.\n\nA: There was a bug with Froyosoft's Sound Booster driver that started happening all of a sudden. Sound Booster installed a driver, so when AppCleaner deleted the app, it left the driver behind, which caused the problem. I found this out after looking through crash logs as suggested by @anki and some others on another question by me.\nAudio utilities can leave behind drivers. Completely uninstall the utilities and their drivers.\nTo know if a certain utility has installed a driver on your computer, check your input and output devices for any devices with the name of the audio utility, e.g. Sound Booster.\nI had to use their driver uninstaller from their website.\n", "Q: Can't set up Touch ID on iPhone 6+ I have an iPhone 6+ that was given to me by the original owner because she thought she had bricked it while attempting to set it up for a family member.\nUsing DFU mode I have un-bricked it, but one problem remains, I can't set up Touch ID. During initial setup, & every time I've gone to set Touch ID up in the Settings app, I see the setup screen for less than a second before it goes to a screen saying, \"Failed Unable to to complete Touch ID setup. Please go back and try again.\" I've tried with a SIM installed & that makes no difference.\n\n\nA: This is what happens when the Touch ID sensor has been replaced and not paired with the secure enclave.\nIf you don’t have the original sensor to put back in the phone, an Apple authorised service provider can replace the sensor and perform the pairing process with the new sensor.\n", "Q: How to mirror iPad display to PC to record I need to put my iPad display onto my PC. By this I mean record or stream iPad footage on software such as OBS or Streamlabs. I have tried several methods such as LonelyScreen, Mirroring360, and even iTools. However none of these have worked so far. I am able to link the iPad to the PC via USB-C cable, so maybe that could be of use.\nI am aware this question has been asked, but it has never been answered well. Also, Youtubers have been able to record iOS footage with OBS, I don't know how. Lastly, I have a piece of hardware that is supposed to record Nintendo switch footage through HDMI, and there are maybe other ports to use for iOS USB c type cable input to OBS. I say maybe because I lost the hardware somewhere in my house, so tell me if I should just go for a hunt to go find it.\n\nA: Have you tried AirServer? They're pretty reliable IIRC and only costs $20. Here's a feature list (it does Airplay obviously): https://www.airserver.com/Compare\n\nA: Yeah, that device was the way to go. They are called Capture Cards, and they use wires not internet servers, which is what I needed. So I just had to go from USB-C to HDMI, through the Capture Card, which then turned it into USB3.0, which finally went into my computer which could pick up video and audio in OBS.

Found a couple people asking the same on Apple forums (like here) but couldn't see a solution.\n\nA: By default, Mac's that have the Apple T2 Security Chip cannot boot from external media.\nYou need to change settings from macOS Recovery using the Startup Security Utility, once a User has been created in the installed version of macOS.\nAlso note that you can not boot to Internet Recovery if you do not connect to the Internet, so make sure your Mac cannot connect to the Internet. Unplug the Ethernet cable, temporarily turn off the Wi-Fi Router and then try booting from the USB flash drive after changing the security settings in the Startup Security Utility.\nIf you currently do not have macOS installed on your MacBook Pro, and you have never changed the default security settings, then you'll need to install from Internet Recovery or take your Mac to an Apple store, or authorized service center.\nSee also: Mac models with the Apple T2 Security Chip\n\nA: I currently have a machine with the same issue.

If you find errors below, feel free to correct them or comment and I will.\n\n*Not all books migrated.  Some had DRM, some had other issues.  The process below does not document the errors, it only documents how to blindly migrate the books that migrate easily by following these steps and ignoring errors.  If it's important to you to migrate every book (which may not even be possible) you'll have to pay close attention and read between the lines.\n\n*This focuses on epub files, and ignores PDFs and other things.  Once you've completed this you'll know what to do with PDFs.\n\n*This assumes some working knowledge of settings in iPad and Kindle, good knowledge of Finder advanced features, and knowledge of how to get around the system in Terminal and run shell commands and simple scripts of 2 or 3 lines from the command line.  Sorry, this is not for beginners.\nSummary\nThe iPad stores books in ePub format, uncompressed and expanded into packages or folders.  We’ll copy them to the Mac, retrieve them from the secret-double-hidden folder they are in, convert them into compressed single-file ePub format, convert those using third party software Calibre into to MOBI files that Kindle can read, and move those to the Kindle.\n Step 1: Sync books from iPad to MacOs using iCloud Drive\n \nOn the iPad enable iCloud Drive and enable it specifically for iBooks.  On the iPad I was working with this was already done so I can’t detail the steps, but they are in Settings.\n \nPlug the iPad into the Mac and open Finder.  Remember, this is for Big Sur and other recent versions of MacOs that don't use iTunes for this.  The iPad will appear in the LHS navigation bar.  Go there and make sure it works.  You will not see the Books folder there, but you should see some things just to confirm the iPad is connected.\nIf you've never done this, it will take a while for iCloud Drive to sync.  Anywhere from seconds to half an hour.  Wait.\n \nThen in Terminal run both the following to open the iBooks locations:\nopen ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud\\~com\\~apple\\~iBooks/Documents\nopen ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks\n\nYou can find more details on this step in this Question\n \nYou'll see your books in one or both of the two windows that open.  You’ll need to repeat Step 2 below for each folder if there are books in both.   I can't find any way other than the \"open\" command to get to these folders!  You can't cd to them and can't navigate to them in Finder by clicking or using Go...\n \nStep 2: Copy the synced books to an ordinary folder\n \nCreate a folder for further work.  Here I'll use ~/Downloads/iBooks.\nGo to each of the two folders you opened with “open” in the last step, select all files, Copy them to  ~/Downloads/iBooks eg with Ctrl-A Ctrl-C Ctrl-V.\nThis will take some time.   Note, despite the time it took to sync iCloud Drive, these files were not synced to your computer!  At this point the files are actually being copied from iCloud to your ordinary folder.  You’ll see each one update with a little timer.\n \nI'm not sure if you can eject the iPad at the end of Step 1, but you can definitely do it now.\n \nStep 3: Convert all the epub folders to compressed epub files\n  \nGo to ~/Downloads/books.  You’ll see your books as a bunch of epub files, but they aren’t files they are folders.  If you only have a few you can compress them by right-clicking in Finder, but I didn't do it that way.  The following assumes you have a lot of books.\n \nIn Terminal go to the iBooks folder and create a new folder for the zipped epub files\ncd ~/Downloads/iBooks\nmkdir zipped\n\n \nZip each epub folder into a file (following works in bash)\nfor f in *; do zip -r zipped/$f $f ; done\n\n \nStep 4: Use Calibre to convert the epubs to mobis\n \nDownload and install Calibre.  During installation select the kind of Kindle you own.\nLoad your files: Run Calibre, click Add Books, navigate to the    zipped folder you just created, select all your new epub files then click Open.\nConvert them to Mobi: In the main Calibre window select all the books you just loaded, click Convert, click Ok.  Watch the Jobs count in the bottom right corner, til it gets to zero.  This might take a while.\nStep 5: Collect all the mobi files\nBy default Calibre puts its converted files in ~/Calibre Library/Unknown.   The last segment of that folder, “Unknown” may be different for you.  It’s the “book author” which for me was Unknown for every book I imported from iBooks.  You'll need to explore the Calibre output folder to make sure of what's going on.  The actual MOBI files for your books are scattered all over folders there so we'll collect them all in one place.\nIn Terminal:\ncd ~/Calibre Library\ncd Unknown (or wherever the books are)\nfind . -name \\*.mobi -exec mv {} . \\;\nmkdir kindle\nmv *.mobi kindle\n\n \nStep 6: Copy the files to Kindle\nFinally!  Plug your kindle into your Mac.  It’ll appear on the left in Finder.  Open it, go to the Kindle's Documents folder then in Documents make a folder for all your migrated books called “iBooks” or whatever you want.  You won't see the folder in the Kindle reader, you'll only see it here in Finder and it'll help you keep things organized.\nUse finder to copy all the Mobi files from the kindle folder in step 5 to the iBooks folder you just created.\nEject the kindle with the Eject icon in Finder's LHS navigation bar.\nThe books will all appear in your Kindle Library.   They will not have cover art and some other features may be missing.   Calibre allows you to migrate cover art but I didn't do that.  I didn't touch any Calibre settings or try any advanced features.   There are other places you can read about doing those things.\n \n Happy reading!\n", "Q: Big Sur install bug on wiped out hard drive I have kind of a complicated problem. Tried using Apple's FAQs and searched many forums.\nMy equipment is iMac 27'' 5k retina i5 3.5ghz.\nI was having troubles upgrading to Big Sur. I was having the \"an error occurred while preparing the update\" message for more than a month now. I tried many of the things posted online and nothing seemed to solve the problem, so I decided to wipe the hard drive clean.\nThrough disk utility I erased my hard drive. When I tried to install again, it appears the option to install Big Sur.\nWhen I did it, the exact same error occurred.\nIt seems now I'm in a worse position than I was before, because now I have a wiped clean HD and the update still won't install.\nOne interesting thing is that, when I click to reinstall macos big sur, the download progress bar doesn't begin from the start, but way from the middle. Then it finishes downloading and starts working the installation. In the middle of the processo, when there is about 17 minutes left, it gives the \"an error occurred\" message I mentioned above.\nOne additional detail: immediately after wiping the hard drive, it prompted me to install High Sierra, but I couldn't because the HD was locked.\nAlso, at that time, an Update partition showed up:\n\nI turned off the computer and on again pressing command-option-R, to access internet boot. So I guess it downloaded the most recent UI:\n\nNow I'm stuck, and really don't know how to proceed. Also, the \"update\" partition doesn't show up anymore.\nThank you for your time reading this.\n\nA: I was able to solve it. Basically I was wiping clean just the \"Macintosh HD\", but I had to do it also on APPLE HDD ST1000DM003. When I did it, I was able to install High Sierra and then Big Sur from there. Thank you for your time!\n", "Q: Compressor Export causes Mac to freeze up, crash When I export a movie from Final Cut Pro to compressor, it begins running just fine. However, it will eventually cause my Mac mini (2018) to start getting graphical glitches (parts of the window or dock will flicker in and out) and eventually the computer will lock up, then shut down. I have 32GB of RAM, of which only 16GB are used, so I don't think it's running out of RAM. I've ran Apple Diagnostics numerous times and it doesn't detect it, nor do I have issues with anything else graphically intensive. My CPU doesn't go above 150℉ [65℃], and the GPU doesn't go above 180℉ [82 ℃].\nDoes anyone know what might be causing this? I'm getting tired of losing progress on projects (apparently final cut doesn't immediately save) as well as the additional time it takes to render something many times before it actually succeeds.\nThis has started happening while rendering the video (inside Final Cut Pro). Does anyone have any idea what's going on?\n\nA: Since you've confirmed in comments that it's not due to memory starvation, we should take a global stackshot and see what the CPU is spending cycles on.\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\". Make sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following command, press Return, type in your password, but do not press Return again yet: sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n*Open FCP and start your compression as normal. Continue until you start experiencing lag.\n\n*As soon as you feel lag, go to the Terminal window where you entered your password and press Return so that the command begins to execute. Do not do anything else on the computer while it's running, otherwise you will distort the data collection.\n\n*After waiting for >10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and add the link to it to your original question.\n\n", "Q: Toggle Voice Control with a keyboard shortcut? Is there a keyboard shortcut to toggle Voice Control on and off on a Mac running Big Sur? Not Dictation, mind you...

It's also (inexplicably) not an option in Accessibility Shortcuts either.\nI use Voice Control regularly but not consistently, so I tend to keep it disabled until I need it. It's a hassle to dive into System Preferences every time I want to enable it.\nBefore you ask, the reason that I don't keep it on all the time (but asleep) is that the floating microphone window is always in the way of something on my MacBook's screen.\nI've Googled and Googled and Googled for this.

I would like to know how to force a Mac to recheck the USB connections without needing to physically unplug and plug them again. Is there a Terminal command for this?\nContext:\nI have a USB audio connection (an amplifier with a DAC) directly connected to my Mac (description below). With everything on, once I plug the USB to the Mac the audio output is correctly detected  and it appears in the menu bar under the sound icon. Also, as expected, when I power off the amplifier the USB audio output is no longer available (it disappears from the sound menu).\nThe problem appears when I power on the amplifier again, since my Mac does not recognize the USB sound output. To make it work, I need to physically unplug and plug again the USB with the amplifier turned on.\nThus, if there was some system command (either through Terminal or by other means) to force the Mac to recheck the USB connections that would be time saving for me.\nConfiguration: The issue occurs on two Macs, both of them with Big Sur 11.4. One is a Mac Pro 2013 and the other a Macbook Pro 2018 13\". I also had the same problem with Catalina. The DAC/Amplifier is an Emotiva TA 100. For either mac, I use a single cable directly connected between the computer and the amplifier.\nUpdate (16/October/2021): I \"solved\" my problem by buying another DAC. I understand that my previous one had some problem, but it would be nice to have a software way to circumvent the issue.\n\nA: You could try launching System Information and looking at the USB section.  Connected devices show up there and CMD-R refreshes the information.  That might cause the Mac to again recognize the amplifier.\n", "Q: Using command line to activate Switch Control To activate Switch Control in Settings, I click the checkbox located in Accessibility -> Switch Control -> Enable Switch Control (at least in Catalina). If I want a program to open Switch Control and automate that process, I have to navigate through the System Preferences app (which I could do with AppleScript). It would be nice if there were a command I could run in the terminal to directly open the Switch Control Panel application. I couldn't find one in my research.\nWhat I tried:\nI followed the instructions in this answer. If it had worked as I wanted it to, I could have changed the \"Switch Control\" setting by editing its corresponding .plist file (sudo defaults write). When I tried this approach with the example provided in the answer (changing \"Display Login Window as:\" from \"List of users\" to \"Name and password\") it worked well. It didn't work when I tested it by changing the \"Enable Switch Control\" setting.\nFollowing the instructions, I made a copy of the preferences folder and the enclosed plist setting files:\n$ sudo cp -r /Library/Preferences before\n\nAfter changing the Switch Control setting and exiting System Preferences, I made a new copy:\n$ sudo cp -r /Library/Preferences after\n\nNext, to see which files changed, I tried:\n$ sudo diff -ur before after\n\nwhich doesn't return any \"Binary files differ\" messages.\nI then tried to use the Activity Monitor to find out what programs run when \"Enable Switch Control\" is on. I found a running application named Assistive Control (AssistiveControl in Activity Monitor).\nI ran $ ps aux and I found this under the COMMAND column:\n/System/Library/Input Methods/Assistive Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Assistive Control launchd -s\n\nWhen I try running the command with Switch Control off in System Preferences, it doesn't do anything. When I try the command when Switch Control is on, I get this error:\ninvalid mode 'kCFRunLoopCommonModes' provided to CFRunLoopRunSpecific - break on _CFRunLoopError_RunCalledWithInvalidMode to debug. This message will only appear once per execution.\nHow can I use the command line to activate Switch Control?\nIt would be great if someone could help me out or give me suggestions.\n\nA: Here is a way from the command line in, e.g., Terminal to turn on Switch Control using a shell script using AppleScript with UI Scripting to programmatically click the Enable Switch Control checkbox in: System Preferences > Accessibility > Switch Control\nThe example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested in Script Editor and as an executable shell script in Terminal under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1 Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nNote that the coding in this shell script assumes that Switch Control has once previously been turned on manually so as to answer the initial System Preferences is trying to unlock Accessibility preferences dialog box where you have entered your User Name and Password then clicked the Unlock button.\nAfter setting up the shell script, and addressing settings mentioned above1, it will then be as simple as typing, e.g., esc in, e.g., Terminal to open Switch Control.\nIt Terminal, type the following compound command and then press enter:\nf=\"esc\"; touch \"$f\"; open -e \"$f\"; chmod +x \"$f\"\n\nCopy and paste the example AppleScript code, shown below, into the opened esc document, (named for [E]nable [S]witch [C]ontrol), then save it and close the document.\nYou should then move the esc executable shell script to a directory that is listed within the PATH passed to the shell.

As a result, it will not uncheck the checkbox to disable Switch Control. That will need to be done my manually closing Switch Control.\nThe example AppleScript code can be modified to uncheck the checkbox to disable Switch Control, however, this will necessitate showing the UI of System Preferences. If you need it to do both and you do not mind seeing System Preferences flash on the screen for a second or two, then use the example AppleScript code show below these notes.\nThat said, regardless, one will see the Dock Tile bounce once in the Dock when the shell script is run and this cannot be avoided.\nWhile this can achieve the goal of enabling Switch Control from the command line, nonetheless, UI Scripting scripting can be kludgy and prone to failure as the hierarchical UI element structure changes with updates to the OS or applications involved.

I've recently got a big screen \"dell U3421WE\". It works great as I can finally save a charger and charging cable. It's all because this display can provide you the power. In the official specs it says:\n\nyour monitor serves as a productivity hub that delivers stable\nEtherneti and up to 90W of power delivery—all in a clutter-free setup.\n\nBut it's weird that since using this feature and removing my original charger. I noticed that my battery has never reached 100%. For instance:\n\nI have never removed the USB-C cable between my display and MBP, so it's always charging.\nIs there anything wrong? Should I put back the original 96W Apple charger?\nUpdates:\nI noticed that my display's power is 90W and the Mac's official charger is 96W. Is that a problem I should take care of?\n\nA: The answer is right there in your screenshot:\n\nCharging On Hold (Rarely Used On Battery)\n\nIt does this because holding a full charge of 100% tends to stress the battery. By keeping it a bit lower, it prolongs the battery's useful life.\nYou can turn off this behaviour in Settings -> Battery -> Battery.\n\nA: \nIs there anything wrong?\n\nNo.\nThe explanation for the behaviour you are observing lies in the following Apple support document:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212049\n\nIf battery charging is paused or on hold on your Mac\nWith macOS Big Sur, your Mac learns from your charging habits to improve the lifespan of your battery.\nIn macOS Big Sur, Optimized Battery Charging is designed to improve the lifespan of your battery and reduce the time your Mac spends fully charged. When the feature is enabled, your Mac will delay charging past 80% in certain situations. Your Mac learns your charging routine and aims to ensure that your Mac is fully charged when unplugged.\n\nYou likely have Optimized battery charging enabled under System Preferences → Battery → Battery\n\nAs you have already mentioned that you keep your MacBook plugged-in all the time, with the aforementioned setting enabled, your Mac is waiting to finish charging past 80% to optimize battery aging.\nTo disbale this behavior and keeping the battery charged to 100%, you can uncheck Optimized battery charging.\n\nA: \nI noticed that my display's power is 90W and the Mac's official charger is 96W. Is that a problem I should take care of?\n\nIt's only a problem if it means your Mac goes into a power save mode due to a low battery sate, this from having to draw from the battery to keep up with power demands.  Seeing that your activity has lead the battery optimization to not fill the battery to 100% would lead me to believe that your display is providing sufficient power for your average needs.\n", "Q: Can you specify a Communications Device that allows mute Mac speakers without muting Communication Device? I have a colleague who has a Mac and we're on a lot of big Zoom meetings together. Unfortunately he has his speaker + communications output on the same speaker so we hear every single alert he receives which frequently cuts him off. If he mutes his speaker it mutes his Jabra Speaker (his comms device).\nI have windows, where we can have a communications device, meaning I can have a speaker + mic dedicated to my Zoom / Skype / etc. but all my other audio is output thorugh my laptop. This allows me to mute my laptop independent of my communications speaker (also a Jabra speaker). Is this possible on Mac? I just want to help him out as he's just had a promotion and will be speaking to much more senior people. I know it's something that frustrates / embarrasses him.\nCan this be done without 3rd party apps? We cannot download many 3rd party apps on our work computers.\n\nA: On macOS, the Sound pane of System Preferences has options to set the output device for 'Sound Effects' (such as System Alerts) separately from the audio device for all other output.\n\nHere, I have it set to be the same as the usual sound output, but it needn't be. And you can set the volume to be different from the normal audio output, including mute.\nZoom has its own settings for audio input and ouput, in its Preferences, which can be the same or different from the system defaults.\n", "Q: How do I know who is sending me push notification and shut it down once and for all?

I am running the latest version of Big Sur (11.4 (20F71)), so I think this is intentional, but I'm not sure why. I have turned off all the battery/power settings that could be the cause (Power nap, etc..)\nPlease see this screenshot of the times the cpu was working (using istat menus)\n\nThanks\n\nA: Some of those spikes look to be every hour, which would suggest Time Machine is launching.\n\nA: Sleep States:\nmacOS has multiple layers of sleep. It is not as simple as suggested by the System Preferences Energy Saver choices, nor by this Apple page which makes it seem simple - either sleep or wake.\nThere is some description of sleep states in the power management man page.  Use the Terminal command man pmset. But this is confusing because it mixes superficial description of states with commands which control those states.\nI have found web searches to produce different, often contradictory, descriptions of sleep states.  My list of sleeping states which is probably not complete and has one question mark:\n\n*\n\n*Sleep - just the lid (on a laptop) closed. Screen off. RAM is still powered.\n\n*Safe Sleep - RAM has been written to disk (hence safe), but still powered.\n\n*Deep Idle - same as Safe Sleep?\n\n*Standby - RAM written to disk and RAM and USB powered off.\n\n*Hibernate - as standby, but everything powered off.\n\nNote that except for hibernate, the Mac will 'Dark Wake' at intervals.\nDiagnosis:\nTo diagnose what is happening we need to inspect the power management log. The detailed log is shown with the Terminal command:\npmset -g log\nWhilst we need that for detailed understanding, useful subsets are:\npmset -g log | grep -e \"Wake from\" -e \"DarkWake\" -e \"due to\"\npmset -g log | egrep \"\\b(Sleep|Wake*|DarkWake|Start)\\s{2,}\"\n\nWe can now see the description for each wake. Amongst other reasons, these can relate timers or network activity.  I do not know a source for a comprehensive or detailed explanation of the descriptions.\nA byproduct of this is that many lines contain the current battery level, which gives us some idea as to how much the regular wakes are draining the battery.\nControlling sleep and wake (optional):\nWe can control these wakes - in particular, reduce them so that there is less battery drain.  After turning off power nap, etc. in system Preferences, get the current power management parameters with:\npmset -g\nThere are two different sets depending on whether you have mains power connected or just using the battery. We are most interested in those under battery power and can change them with sudo pmset -b.\nFor my MacBook I drastically reduced overnight battery drain by disabling network wakes and reducing the time before the MacBook goes into deeper sleep states.  My changes include:\n\n*\n\n*sudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0 to turn off repeated network wakes.\n\n*sudo pmset -g standbydelayhigh 7200 (2 hours)\n\n*sudo pmset -g standbydelaylow 7200 (2 hours)\n\n*sudo pmset -g autopoweroffdelay 14400 (4 hours)\n\nDon't make too many changes at once and (as used to be recommended) don't change hibernatemode to 25.\n", "Q: How to make MacOS Catalina to receive incoming X connections (without ssh tunnels) I am trying to make my MacOS Catalina to receive incoming X conncetions.

What else can be done?\nDon't suggest to make ssh tunnel please.\n\nA: You need to make sure that XQuartz is started before attempting to run xcalc.\nWhen XQuartz is started, you can run this command in the xterm that appears:\necho $DISPLAY\n\nIt should let you know which display number you're using. Make sure to use the same display number after the : on the Linux side.\nIn addition you'll want to ensure that you haven't firewalled the incoming ports (6000, 6001, etc. depending on your display number) on the Mac computer. For example if you're using a tool like Little Snitch or similar, you should ensure that you haven't setup anything there to block this traffic.\n", "Q: MacBook headphone audio leaking into mic When I connect my headphones (with built-in mic) into the 3.5mm jack of my MacBook Pro, the mic input picks up audio that is played through the headphones. This means that whenever I'm on a voice call, the other party can hear my system audio. This issue is not specific to any app. If I play any audio on the system and monitor the input level for the external microphone via System Preferences>Sound>Input, I can see the bars fill up, and this seems to be proportional to the volume of the headphones. I'm sure the headphone sounds are not being physically picked up by the mic. Also the headphones themselves are not causing this issue, because I tested them on my phone and there are no feedback loops. I'm inclined to think it is either a hardware issue with my Mac or something that is caused by software. Is there a way to figure out what's causing this?

Once the files are synced, I am allowed to remove them from my local drive and still have them in the cloud. The thing I really like about this system is that I can see what is stored locally and what isn't with this little status tag on the side of a file or folder. It is explained in greater detail here. I find this to be super convenient as I can still navigate my files without having to load them all on my machine, load them if I need to, and remove them when I'm done with them. If I'm not mistaken, services like Dropbox and iCloud use a similar system.\nFurthermore, I have a lot of files that I keep on an external hard drive (mainly pictures and music). I like the way that OneDrive works, and I was wondering if there was a way, perhaps through an app, to use my HD the same way I'm using OneDrive.\nHere's what I'm thinking: I'd like to have a folder on my computer that will be synced with my HD. Whenever I connect the HD to my machine, any new files that I've put in that folder on my laptop while not connected to the HD will get synced. Any file that were put on my HD, say via another computer, will also get synced to that folder. I'd like to be able to free up some space on my computer by removing it from my machine, but knowing that it is safe on the HD. And once a file is removed from my laptop, I'd like to be able to see it exists (without having access to its actual content, much like OneDrive). Ideally, I'd also have a status icon to know what's stored locally, what's not, etc. All in all, the title of the post sums it all: I would like to make my workflow with my external Hard Drive behave similarly to OneDrive.\nIs there an app or built-in system that would do that?\nI'd be willing to get my hands dirty with the automator or writing some scripts, for instance, if that is possible.

It doesn't exactly work the same way as I would have hope, but it does work pretty well. For instance, I don't get the little icons like the ones from OneDrive or have the convenience of downloading them at will, but it's not too bad.\nAnd as a bonus, I can use the archival functionality of the software to better manage the files that I put in OneDrive (yay!).\n", "Q: Do app developers have the option to prevent their window from being 'zoomed'? There's an option in System Preferences > Dock where you can double click on the top of a window to make it fit the screen, or what Apple calls 'zoom'.\nIs there some way where an app developer can prevent this, while still letting their app window be resized by dragging the edges of the window?\n\nA: Yes. App developers can set AppleActionOnDoubleClick to ‘Maximize’, ‘Minimize’ or ‘None’.\n", "Q: File Management advice needed (Adobe Lightroom Classic) I'm finally getting around to moving my old Aperture library (~150,000 images) into Lightroom Classic and need a bit of advice regarding file management.\nHere is my scenario:\n\n*\n\n*All of my images (from my current LR catalog and my Aperture library) were in a PHOTO_MASTERS folder, which is organzied by Year/Month (2021/01, 2021/02, etc)\n\n*Over 15 years or so, there are other \"extra\" files in the PHOTOS_MASTERS folder that are NOT part of my current LR Catalog, nor part of my Aperture Library.\n\n*I consolidated all the masters from my Aperture Library into Aperture, so they are no longer in the PHOTO_MASTERS folder\n\n*Now in my PHOTO_MASTERS folder I have all the images from my LR Catalog, AND the extra images that are not in my LR Catalog.\n\n*I want to separate these two groups of files so that I can review the extra images and decided what to do with them.\n\nHow can I separate the files that are part of my LR catalog from the remaining \"extra\" files?\nI've reviewed all the options available in LR, but seems they are only useful for finding missing files, not extras.\nThank you...\n\nA: This might work for you (if I have understood the problem correctly):\nI am going to find the Extra photos and (optionally) import them into a new folder in LR.\n\n*\n\n*In LR Classic, do an Import and choose your PHOTO_MASTERS folder.\n\n*At the top click New Photos.\n\nThat will show you all the photos which are NOT in LR.\nIt might take a while if you already have lots of photos in the folder (or its sub-folders).\nYou can, if your want, import those files into the new LR folder:\n\n*\n\n*Choose Move at the top.\n\n*On the right, as a Destination, create a new LR folder.\n\n*Any other processing you want. That might include Into Subfolder by date.\n\n*and Import (at the bottom-right).\n\nNow you have identified the 'Extras' and separated them from the other photos whilst loading them into LR.\n", "Q: Adding Free space to Container disk2 Is there a way to move (free space) and add it to Container disk2 in /dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *28.0 GB    disk0\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk2⁩         27.7 GB    disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk2⁩         471.2 GB   disk1s2\n                    (free space)                         528.8 GB   -\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +498.9 GB   disk2\n                                 Physical Stores disk0s2, disk1s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨MacOS Data⁩              93.4 GB    disk2s1\n   2:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 285.5 MB   disk2s2\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                652.6 MB   disk2s3\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      2.1 GB     disk2s4\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨MacOS BigSur⁩            22.7 GB    disk2s5\n   6:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 22.7 GB    disk2s5s1\n```\n\n\nA: Yes, The terminal command :\ndiskutil ap resizecontainer disk2 0b\n\nwill do the job ;-)\n", "Q: ionice equivalent for MacOS? On Linux systems I use ionice to lower I/O scheduling priority for processes like backups that interfere as little as possible with interactive usage of the system. Is there an equivalent for MacOS?\n\nA: On macOS you'll find a similar program named taskpolicy that comes with the system. It allows you to both start a new program with a specific I/O scheduling policy, as well as change the I/O scheduling policy for an already running process. You will want to run it with the -d parameter, allowing you to set the I/O policy as either important (highest priority), standard, utility or throttle (lowest priority). There's also a level named passive that basically ignores priorities all together.\nA simpler, open-source alternative also exists here:\nhttps://github.com/DrHyde/ionice-MacOS\nIt allows you to set the I/O scheduling priority for a new command you start, but you cannot change it for an already running process or query an already running process for its priority.\n", "Q: Move window back from out of the screen Occasionally I got window showing only left lower corner on the screen. Other parts are out of the screen. Window header is out of the screen.\nIs it possible to bring it back?\nOn Windows I would try to initiate window dragging by keyboard, but what to do on MacOS?\n\nI have several monitors which I am connecting and disconnecting from time to time. Sometimes this leads to described situation.\nI would like general solution. Suppose I have 2 monitors connected, but only one is physically accessible. Suppose window is on montor 2 and I am on monitor 1. Can I bring window to monitor 1?\n\nA: Regardless of the position of the window you can use the commands in the menubar to get the window back on the screen (in most cases).\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the application of the off-screen window is in focus. You can use CMD+Tab to navigate to the app and focus it.\n\n\n*In the menubar go to Window → Zoom (second option of that menu)\n\nThe off-screen window should now move onto the screen.\n\nA: You can drag a window by any part of the bottom edge, so long as you're not triggering the resize arrows.\n\nIf you're really stuck, then add Zoom as a key command…\n\nIf this happens in one specific app, contact the developer. Windows shouldn't ever go offscreen entirely, or ever cross the menu bar.\nIf all this fails, close then re-open the Window - it ought to be forced back inside the screen.\n\nA: I have one old program that is still useful, but has not been updated in a long time. When it gets stuck I can't even grab enough as the previous answers recommend.\nA very simple solution I've found is to temporarily hide the Menu bar. Go to System Preferences app → General and check Automatically hide and show the menu bar.\nThis will hide the Menu bar, which can be easily revealed by hovering the cursor towards top of the screen.\nNow once the menu bar is hidden, carefully move the cursor just up to the app title bar, without touching the edge of the screen. Drag the app window to suitable location.\nOnce done, you can disable Menu bar autohide.\n", "Q: Downgrade iPhone 12 camera to a single lens, with an app? I think the iPhone 12 double lens camera produces images which are not artistically focused, with extra sharpness all over the image rather than a single point of focus, and too much light reducing the natural dynamics of the scene.\nI have basically just downgraded to iPhone XR as a consequence as it is driving me mad. Haven't taken a good photo since I got the 12.\nOtherwise I like the iPhone 12. Is there some way to \"dowgrade\" the camera or app? Just to use a single lens like before?\n\nA: The iPhone 12 only uses one lens at a time to take a photo, so essentially what you want is already what you get.\nRemember that at the bottom of the standard Camera app, you can switch between \"Photo\" mode and \"Portrait\" mode - and that with the \".5x / 1x / 2x\" indicator just above, you can switch between lenses.\nPerhaps it is the new lens correction feature for the Ultra Wide lens that is annoying you. You can turn that off from Settings in the Camera section where you'll find a slider for Lens Correction.\n\nA: I found that by turning off the \"true tone\" in Settings -> Display and Brightness, it massively changed how the image was represented on the screen. The \"oranging\" effect or \"over lighting\" is gone, and the picture looks more natural.\n", "Q: Run script from .bash_profile for first Terminal tab/window only I want to run a script from .bash_profile, but only for the first Terminal window/tab which I open. How can I prevent script execution when opening additional windows/tabs?\n\nA: If this script starts an application/binary, the usual way to prevent several executions is to first check whether that binary is already running (man ps or man psgrep might help) and only launch it if it isn't already started.\nAs an alternative you could look into LaunchAgents to start the binary directly when you log in (and even have it restarted automatically in case it crashes).\n", "Q: How do I force HTTPS in Safari for macOS? How do I force Safari to always use HTTPS on macOS (11.4+)?

The only answers I've seen are \"You can't turn it off\" and \"You have to use icloud.com on a desktop to mark as not junk, and that might work\".\nicloud.com mail is awful, and I'll also go entire days without using my home desktop - and even if I do this, the first message from a new contact might end up in junk and get ignored - so I'm looking for an automated way of checking my junk folder without having to think about it or check manually.\nIdeally, some kind of rule to either stop messages from going in, or find any messages and move them back. Is there an existing IFTTT rule, iPhone Shortcut, Apple Script, anything like that, which might do this on a regular basis?\nThis problem is on the iCloud server side, not junk mail handling in the Mac Mail app.\n\nA: From my understanding, mail rules in your local mail client would be your best bet, whichever client that may be. Only one of your clients has to enforce the rule for it to propagate to the rest of your mail clients.\nFor example in Apple Mail on MacOS:\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2019 Not Charging From Powerbank I have 30000mAh power bank that I bought to use to charge my MacBook Pro 2019. But I found out that it's not working. My computer says: Power Source: Power Adapter; Battery is Not Charging.\nIs this a problem?\n\nA: Yes - it’s a problem if you depend on this to charge your Mac at full speed, no it’s no problem if you are patient and use this to recharge while the Mac is off or sleeping. Even an idle Mac can take more power than some chargers provide when they are working correctly.\n\nPower Source: Power Adapter; Battery is Not Charging\n\nThis means a power source is connected but it is not providing sufficient wattage to charge the battery.\nThe wattage required by using the computer is more than the wattage provided by the power supply, so the battery will continue to discharge.\nTurn off the laptop to reduce the wattage required to run it so the internal battery charges, or buy a power bank which provides a higher wattage.\nThe milliamp hours of the power bank tells you how much charge the bank can store, not how quickly it can deliver it. Look at the wattage of the power bank and compare it to the 96W wall adapter your MacBook Pro came with. Apple increased the wattage of the wall adapter from 87W to 96W for the 2019 MacBook Pro to keep up with the demands of the laptop — your power bank won't be able to match this, but with extremely light usage (or powered off) a high wattage power bank can still charge MacBook.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro keeps crashing while trying to reinstall; how can I figure out what's wrong? My MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) has been crashing during startup for the last four days. It was running macOS Big Sur. My MacBook froze while I was using it, then suddenly shut down. After re-starting, it froze again shortly and hasn't been able to fully start ever since: it would freeze again during login or right after while re-opening the applications that I had open.\nI have tried a few things without success, and I'm not completely sure what to try next.\n\n*\n\n*I have run the Apple Diagnostics by holding d while my MacBook starts up, but it found no problem with my system.\n\n*I have reset the PRAM by holding option + command + P + R while starting my MacBook and waited to hear the boot chime twice, but that didn't fix the problem.\n\n*I have reset the SMC by holding shift + control + option and the power button, but that didn't fix the problem.\n\n*I have tried using \"safe boot\" by holding shift and starting my MacBook. It was showing a red \"safe boot\" in the upper right corner of the screen, but crashed again during login.\n\n*I have tried the Internet Recovery by holding command + R while my MacBook starts up, but after downloading the image, my MacBook freezes and shows an Apple logo. The EFI log ends with\n#[SSR|>] Attempting to mount 482075478 bytes as ramdisk\nBooting Recovery OS.\n\n\n\n*I have tried re-installing MacOS by creating a bootable installer for macOS, following Apple's instructions, but it crashes after #[EB|LOG:EXITBS:START]:\n\nFinally, my system has proven to be stable when started on a minimal Gentoo Linux distribution. I used it to look at the EFI logs without any issue.\nWhat else can I try to figure out what's wrong with my MacBook? Should I try to completely wipe the internal SSD?\nIf I remove the EFI partition from the SSD, will I be able to re-install everything? Will I be able to do this using my bootable installer? By putting this Mac in target disk mode and running the installer on another MacBook? Is there any chance that completely wiping the EFI will be of any help?\n\nA: Providing you have a backup, you should boot with the USB macOS installer flash drive. Run Disk Utility set View -> Show all Devices and First Aid check the internal drive. But not just the drive or even the container. Unmount all volumes inside the container and check each one.  Work top down checking each level from Drive -> Container -> Volumes. Also make note if Disk Utility shows any S.M.A.R.T errors on the internal drive which would indicate hardware failure of the SSD (possibly, could still be bad without S.M.A.R.T errors).\nIf after running First Aid Disk Utility it's still crashing then completely delete the internal drive. Then try re-installing from the USB flash drive. If that fails, try Internet Recovery.\nIf you use Shift-Option-Command-R during startup, you're offered the macOS that came with your Mac, or the closest version still available. If you use Option-Command-R during startup, in most cases you're offered the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac. Otherwise you're offered the macOS that came with your Mac, or the closest version still available.\nIf all else fails, then there is likely a hardware failure that is not being detected by the internal diagnostics.  Apple has more advanced diagnostics that the public doesn't have access to.\n", "Q: How do I keep iCloud from clobbering my data? Everytime I activate iCloud on my old macPro (OS 10.11.6) it erases all my local Calendar entries and I have to spend the day restoring from Time Machine. I have never put my Keychain data into the cloud or upgraded my Notes for fear of losing critical data in the process and of losing control of that data. Unfortunately it looks like there is no way to migrate certain Keychains to a new machine (OS 11.4) without using the iCloud service.\nI figured there would be a way to clear the already uploaded iCloud Calendars so there would be nothing on the cloud side to replace the local data as it syncs, but cannot find a way to do that.\nHow do you activate iCloud and migrate critical data (specifically local keychains and calendars) to a new machine in a way that assures the data on the original machine is in no way threatened or lost in the process?\n\nA: This is a little too obvious, but...\nExport the local data first, then if necessary, import again after connecting to iCloud.\n\nA: Found way to skip the cloud all together thus keeping its hands off my sensitive bits.\nIn the case of the \"login keychain\" it was simply a matter of copying the Keychains folder (~/Library/Keychains) over to the new machine, then adding the contained login keychain from within Keychain Access on the new machine (File>Add Keychain...). Be sure to wipe the file off your transfer medium since it is all your passwords.\nThis probably would have worked with the Calendar archive file, but since it eventually moved via iCloud I did not test.\n", "Q: How to switch back to autofocus while recording video? If I'm recording a video on my iPhone, it autofocuses by default\nIf I tap somewhere on the screen, a yellow square appears and it switches to manual focus\nIs there a way to switch back to autofocus in the middle of recording a video?\n\nA: I don't believe that there is a way to force it to autofocus but it will re-focus if you don't touch it again.\nFrom Apple Support:\n\nYour camera automatically focuses the image and adjusts the exposure based on what you’re pointing it towards. That way, you always start with a brightly lit photo.\nYou can change the camera focus and exposure to a specific area. Before you take the photo, tap the place on the screen that you want to adjust. If you want to keep the focus and exposure in the same spot, press and hold on the screen until you see AE/AF Lock.\n\n\nA: At least currently (in 2021; iOS 14), you can’t directly re-enable continuous autofocus during a recording once you have clicked on the screen (and thus switched to what traditional cameras often call “single autofocus”) using the built-in iOS “Camera” app. As others have said, you can tap on the screen to automatically focus on a new spot (which also exits AE/AF lock mode, if it was enabled), but again, that process stops as soon as focus has been achieved (i.e. it sets up a new AF lock at that distance and begins using the new area for AE exposure metering).\nAn option that may work in some circumstances: double-tapping on either the record button or one of the physical volume buttons (on the iPhone itself or on Apple-compatible wired^ earbuds / headphones … with the latter you don’t risk jostling the phone if it is mounted) will quickly stop and re-start the recording and therefore re-enable continuous autofocus. The gap in the video should be no larger than the normal autofocus delay; I recommend practicing this method yourself to get the timing right … if the two taps / clicks are too quick, they may only be recognized as one.\nFinally, various third-party free or paid apps (e.g. FiLMiC Pro [1] [2]) do seem to offer the ability to re-enable continuous autofocus while recording.\nGood luck, and happy recording!\n\n^ This may also work for wireless earbuds / headphones, but I have no experience either way - again, feel free to test with your specific setup.\n[1] https://apps.apple.com/us/app/filmic-pro-video-camera/id436577167\n[2] https://momofilmfest.com/how-to-use-focus-for-cinematic-video-filmic-pro-tutorial/\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 15, 2017: Discharges in Sleep mode My Macbook Pro 15, 2017 loses full charge (from 100% to 0%) during a 9 hr SLEEP duration.\nRunning this:\npmset -g\n\nThrows the following result:\nSystem-wide power settings:\nCurrently in use:\n lidwake              1\n autopoweroff         1\n standbydelayhigh     86400\n autopoweroffdelay    259200\n standbydelaylow      10800\n standby              1\n proximitywake        1\n ttyskeepawake        1\n hibernatemode        3\n powernap             0\n gpuswitch            2\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n highstandbythreshold 50\n displaysleep         15\n womp                 0\n networkoversleep     0\n sleep                1 (sleep prevented by apsd)\n tcpkeepalive         1\n halfdim              1\n acwake               0\n\nSo far I have tried the following:\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalled MacOS\n\n*Replaced Battery + Top cover + Keyboard + Trackpad, as a part of the Apple quality program.\n\nNothing has worked.

We want to share a Mojave Client via VNC to a Grahic Agency.\nWe ran about the question, how the color informations are transmitted. We normally do color management with a calibrated monitor locally.\nI didn't find helpful information on how VCN transmits color information.\nCan someone give me a hint on this?\n\nA: Use a known reference to calibrate your local and remote displays. No other approach will be able to provide a consistent or predictable result.\nVNC is a protocol and not an implementation. Both client and server implementations will make their own decisions about colour management.\nWhere available, ensure your VNC server and client are using their maximum quality settings available. This will help reduce visual differences introduced during video encoding and decoding.\nColour Encoding\nIt is likely the VNC service will use macOS's Quartz Display Services to access and then transcode the contents of the display.\nCGDisplayStreamCreate is the function used to gain access to the display and the call can request a specific pixel format. The colour space used is set as a property to this call, see kCGDisplayStreamColorSpace.\nThis means that the colour space and colour information will depend on the VNC server used.\nYou may also find the VNC client alters the colour output.\nDo not rely on VNC for faithful colour reproduction. Calibrate the output displays.\n", "Q: What should I tell Siri to set up a reminder on Wednesday at 3pm with text \"Team meeting is tomorrow at 4pm\" These phrases and variations don't work:\n\n*\n\n*Hey Siri, remind me on Wednesday at 3 pm about a meeting tomorrow at 4pm\n\n*Hey Siri, remind me about tomorrow's 4pm Team meeting on Wednesday at 3pm.\n\n*...\n\nWhat would be the optimal phrase for Siri to set up the appropriate reminder?\n\nA: This worked for me:\n“Remind me at 3pm today that I have a meeting at 4pm tomorrow”\nHowever, it seems to be inconsistent.

What I am trying to do is to record the audio that is being sent to the idec from an external device via phono cable (dual) on an iPhone because the idec has a record to iPod function as shown in QuickStart manual for the idec.\nBecause the idec is so old, it only has the ability to record to old iPods. Once I have an adaptor for the old connection is there any way I can record this audio to my iPhone (ios12)?\n\nA: Old ipods mean 30-pin connector.  It had audio in on pin 5 and 6.\nThe modern lightning connector does not have audio in, so the idec may not be suitable, and you need an adapter that can.  As the iPhone 6 supports the Lightning to USB-3 adapter https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W2AM/A/lightning-to-usb-3-camera-adapter the easiest way if the iPhone 6 is fully updated is probably getting this and a quality USB recording device presenting itself as a standard USB device not requiring special drivers.\nThen garageband or any other recording app should do what you want.\n", "Q: Creating a firmlink in /usr on MacOS 10.15 & 11 I cannot disable SIP to make / (root filesystem) writeable in my environment, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a synthetic firmlink in /usr instead.\nI have no problem creating firmlinks under / by adding entries in /etc/synthetic.conf but cannot create one under /usr.\nTried this in /etc/synthetic.conf with a reboot but it doesn't work:\nusr/config          System/Volumes/Data/config\n\nAny tip (rather than disabling/enabling SIP or using /usr/local) would be very much appreciated, if there's a way.

Upon contacting T-Mobile about this, they said that they goofed up and improperly recorded which iPhone they had sent me. They said they marked the one they sent me as lost/stolen, and evidentially, they can't undo that or something. Long story short, they sent\nme a new working iPhone and said I could just keep the other one that was marked as lost/stolen. Physically, it is a perfectly working brand new iPhone. I've done some research and found out that when a device is marked as lost/stolen, T-Mobile places it's IMEI on a blacklist.\nI am wondering if there is a way to fix this second iPhone so I can give it to my son. There are a few websites that claim to be able to remove the IMEI from the carrier blacklist for $100 or so, but they all look kind of sketchy, so I'm hesitant about using one of those. Does anybody know of a legit way/service to fix this iPhone?\n\nA: There is not.  If there were, TMobile would simply have done so.\n", "Q: Why did my app name not change on my device? I launched an app a couple of years ago.\nThe app re-branded. Owned by the same company. We renamed the app in the App Store. Logo updated.\nIn App Store Connect, iTunes, etc. I see the new app name. In Test Flight, the new name is shown.\nAdditionally, the various spots within the app (like the Display Name) and other internal areas where the name were used were all updated.\nHowever, in my Settings app, and on my device where the icon and app name are, the old name is still shown.\nWhy is this? Is there a way to change this?\n\nA: The name of the app in App Store Connect is purely for the name used on the product page on the App Store.\nThe name of the app when installed on device is controlled by the display name of the app written into the app bundle downloaded by the device. Change this in the Display Name field of the target settings in Xcode.\n", "Q: Completely random keyboard behavior with duplicate keys and access to LaunchPad I have the combination of multiple problems that I have seen individually in the net.\n\n*\n\n*My keyboard repeats letters randomly.

Where in the filesystem are the dictionary files used in the native Mac Dictionary app located? In previous OSes, they were in Library/Dictionary. I don't see that directory in MacOS Big Sur.\nMore importantly, how could I effectively search for them? I tried searching my whole computer in the Finder for the keywords \"dictionary\" and \"oxford english\", and they didn't appear. Are the files hidden? Would there be a good terminal command to fuzzy keyword search all files including hidden ones? Or, would it be possible to see what files the Dictionary app uses by examining the app, somehow?\n\nA: The Finder (Spotlight) doesn't include system files in its results.\nDictionaries are now downloaded when selected, so they fall into the murky file path of:\n/System/Library/AssetsV2/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX\n\ninside various \"AssetData\" subfolders.\nI recommend EasyFind as a good all-purpose real-time file searcher.\nhttps://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/freeware\n", "Q: Thermal throttling after Big Sur update My 2015 i7 MacBookPro started to thermal throttle after the update to Big Sur:\n\n*\n\n*in previous system, the Mac went up to 90°C degrees before slowing down. And it would not thermal throttle at all. The thermal throttling temperature seemed to be 98°C degrees.\n\n*currently it thermal throttles at 70°C degrees: the CPU frequency slows down to 800 MHz and GPU down to 200 MHz (as indicated by Intel Power Gadget)\n\nThis is all after I installed \"Macs Fan Control\" and this is after I set it to \"Full Blast\" which means 6100 RPM. I have already changed the CPU thermal paste.\nHow can I change the \"thermal throttling\" temperature to a higher value?\n\nA: The \"problem\" will most likely disappear if you turn off MacsFan Control.\nI have experienced very similar problems when settings MacsFan Control to full blast thinking, this would ensure the coolest CPU temps possible. However, in my case kernel_task started to spike to a couple 100% of CPU usage which is very often an indicator for thermal throttling.\nMy suspicion is that when setting the fan speed with MacsFan Control your MacBook loses control over the fan speed and as it does not know what you will do next it starts throttling to avoid any problems.\nWhen your MacBook controls the FanSpeed it knows it can adjust the fan speed and CPU/GPU power as needed, however, when you manually set the fan speed it loses part of its mechanism to ensure low enough temps for the Computer. It then plays it safe by throttling the CPU so much that it will definitely not be harmful in case you would e.g. suddenly completely turn off the fans.\n", "Q: Unavailable option on Apple clang only; version mismatch?

It is currently 11 years old and cannot run the current stable OS, which means security updates simply won't come.\nInstead sell it to an Apple collector (yes they exist) and use the profits to fund a replacement device that is supported.\nYou might be able to install another OS like linux or perhaps win10, but realistically it won't be able to run the same software as you're used to and becomes nothing more than a curiosity.\n\nA: High Sierra it is. I just spent US$235 for a Nvidia GeForce GTX 760, to update my monitors' resolution higher than the current 1920x1200 I'm seeing. It's a Metal Capable card, and will let me run Mojave if I'd like. Still, the OP needs to share what his use case is. The best upgrade on these machines is moving the boot drive to an SSD.\nTo that point, given all the HD bays you have, I'd highly suggest you first get an SSD loaded with the OS. You'll find that some software breaks as you move up, and having the ability to boot from 2 drives can help you avoid an unpleasant surprise. How to create a bootable macOS High Sierra installer drive should help. You can create a new installation, and use migration assistant to copy apps over to the new boot drive.\n\nA: According to everymac.com, the latest version of macOS for your Mac is Mojave (10.14.X). However, according to this Apple article, you need to first be running at least High Sierra (10.13.6). You will also probably need to upgrade your graphics card.\nAccording to this Apple article to need to first be running at least Mountain Lion (10.8.X), before upgrading to High Sierra. The upgrade to High Sierra will also upgrade the firmware so your Mac can boot from APFS.\nAccording to this Apple article, you can upgrade to El Capitan (10.11.X) from Lion (10.7.X).\nThis Apple article explains how to download older versions of OS X and macOS.\nI should first point out Tetsujin has a more extensive answer to the question How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS?\nAlthough upgrading from a USB flash drive installer may be optional, I will include this Apple article on how to do so.\nUpgrading to Mojave will require using APFS. If you are using a HDD then you may discover the Mac will run much slower than High Sierra without APFS. You might consider upgrading to a Nvme SSD.\n\nSo start by upgrading to El Capitan.\nNext upgrade to High Sierra.\nFinally, upgrade to Mojave. This may require hardware upgrades.\n", "Q: Set Detailed Bluetooth Audio Codec preferences in macOS Monterey TL;DR\nPreferences set in ~root/Library/Preferences/bluetoothaudiod.plist don't seem to have any effect any more. “Bluetooth Explorer” and defaults(1) commands that messed with these don’t seem to work either. Does anyone know how to go about doing these things in Monterey?\n\nHistorically, we pedants and audiophiles on macOS have been able to tweak bluetoothaudiod.plist to our own fancy. We were essentially restricted to setting AAC bitrates, toggling AptX (not AptX HD, mind you), and packet buffer limits and stuff, but it was still something.\nThe way to go about this in GUI was to use “Bluetooth Explorer”, an Xcode \"extra\" that is last known to have been distributed with Xcode 11.\nOf course, one could always use defaults(1) as well.\n\nAs GianpaoloPascasi points out in a post below, tweaking BT-audio codecs can sometimes be a necessity.\nHow does one tweak the stuff that Bluetooth Explorer and bluetoothaudiod.plist managed, in Monterey?\n\nA: I confirm! Bluetooth explorer and the terminal commands (sudo defaults write bluetoothaudiod) are not working, giving no errors.\nI saw that in /Library/Preferences/ there is an empty plist file \"com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\"...\nP.S.\nI started searching because i have a brand new pair of Xiaomi Earbuds Basic 2 and they often loss connection, they sound very weird when using their microphone and sometimes the sound playing even \"jumps\". All of this on a Macbook Pro 13\" 2020. I'd like to go back to BigSur and try out the Bluetooth explorer...\nObviusly, they work good on my Windows laptop and on my phone.\nThe worst thing is that a lot of tutorials cover old methods (putting the keyword \"Monterey\" SUCH WOW) no longer working.

But when they configured it, she neglected to write down the new passcode & then keep it where she could find it again.\nFast forward to today. Now I'm trying to turn on \"Find My\" & iCloud backup, but can't because it requires that passcode. After checking with her, I followed instructions to reset the phone (\"restore\"). And now I'm going through the setup procedure: I chose \"English\", then \"United States\", then entered a new passcode (WHICH I WROTE DOWN!).\nBut now it says, \"Enter Passcode for Other iPhone\". That appears to refer to her old iPhone, which as I mentioned was lost, and I don't think she knew the passcode for that one either.\nI thought I was out of the woods when I was able to set a new passcode, but suddenly there's this new hurdle to overcome. TIA for any ideas on how to get past this!\n\nA: You can skip by this.

Do the old Apple Earpods, i.e. those with 3.5mm plugs, have cables and plugs capable of providing balanced audio?\nBy balanced audio, I mean, audio transmitted in the form of \"two copies of the same incoming audio signal, sometimes referred to as a hot (positive) and cold (negative) signal\" providing \"common-mode rejection\" for noise. (See \"Balanced Vs. Unbalanced Audio: What's The Difference?\" for more details on balanced vs unbalanced audio.)\n\nA: In short, no.\nBalanced stereo requires 5 wires, hot & cold left, hot & cold right, plus ground. It also needs an un-balancing amp in the receiver.\nAside from that, headphones run at much higher voltages than mics & really don't need to run balanced. Also the mic on a headset is high impedance, suitable for short runs only. Balancing a mic signal to be able to send it over long cable runs requires a low impedance mic.\n", "Q: Is there a difference between A1435 and A1425 chargers? I own a A1502 MacBook Pro Retina 13\" display. It came with a 60W charger model A1435.

Can both of them charge A1502 MacBook?\n\n*Are those dimensionally compatible? Can same accessories fit both models?\n\nThanks in advance for the answers!\n\nA: The A1425 is the Macbook itself, the A1435 is the charger. So they are \"compatible\" in the sense that the accessories of the cases just add the identifier of the macbook that the charger came with.\nSo it is the same thing, once described by it's model number and once by the macbook that it was shipped with. You can buy accessories with either identifier and they will fit.\n", "Q: Trying to Run Windows 10 on Flashed Mac Pro 4, 1 now 5, 1 Bootable USB Storage Error Bootcamp I want to run Windows 10 on my flashed 2009 Mac Pro 5, 1 with Bootcamp.\nCurrently OS X 10.11.6 and the Nvidia GT 120 are present.\nI am able to start the process to create the bootable USB drive but every time the progress bar stops midway and says that there is not enough space on my USB drive. The USB is 123GB and completely cleared. The Windows 10 ISO is around 6GB. I have also tried reformatting it to FAT32 and exFAT, with no luck. I have also disabled Time Machine and automatic backups.\nDoes anyone know a fix to this or should I just install Windows 10 via DVD?\n\nA: @Tetsujin Yeah, I think I am just going to go spend $20 on some Dual Layer DVDs and install it like that. Thanks for trying to help though. I just wanted to see if anyone here was struggling with the same issue. Thanks.\n\nA: In your question, you asked how to fix using a flash drive. This answer addresses this part of your question.\nThe following is generally true for Macs of your vintage.\n\n*\n\n*Windows needed be installed to BIOS boot. If you can get Windows to UEFI boot, then some of the hardware usually did not work properly.\n\n*Windows and the Windows installer can not BIOS boot from USB drives.\n\n*Booting from ExFAT formatted Windows installer first requires installing High Sierra or newer version of MacOS. The High Sierra installer does a firmware upgrade which allows booting from APFS and ExFAT volumes.\n\nSo, if the newest version of OS X (or macOS) ever installed is OS X 10.11.6 on your Mac Pro, then one may incorrectly conclude installing Window 10 by USB flash drive would not be possible. However, this is probably not true.\nIt turns out that the Windows installer (as well as Windows) can be BIOS booted from Grub. One method of acquiring Grub would be to install Debian Linux. This version of Linux offers an USB flash drive installer which can be EFI booted and install a BIOS booting Grub and 64 bit Debian. Once Grub is used to boot the Windows Installer, Grub and Debian can be replaced by Windows. As you can imagine, the installation procedure is complex with many steps. Therefore, you would probably want to try using a DL DVD first to install Windows 10.\nBelow is a link to an answer where Grub is used to install a 64 bit Windows 10. If you were to choose to use Grub, then the procedure would have to be modified to work with your Mac. For example, you would use a 64 bit Debian instead of a 32 bit Debian.\nCan a version of Windows newer than Vista be installed on MacBookPro2,2 2006 Core 2 Duo?\n\nA: Update: I managed to get the installation screens on windows 10. However, the screen says that the product key could not be verified. I have purchased a physical key from Microsoft so I am not worried about it not being authentic. Some error is just happening that prevents the key from being verified.\nEven worse, I now cannot boot into my Mac OS because it is not reading my hard drives. It instead shows that black screen that says “no bootable disk”. I tried holding down option and tried doing a PRAM reset with command + option + p + r. No luck. Only the disk reader which has the windows installer is being read and the computer is forced to boot into windows which it can’t install. I manually ejected the installer disk and inserted my installation disk for snow leopard just to see if that would work and it doesn’t detect it.\nI have never seen anything like this before. Any ideas?\n", "Q: Why do I have to disable Find my iPhone? According to the page on preparing your device for repair, you must turn off Find My iPhone before handing in your phone for repair:\n\nIf you're unable to turn off Find My iPhone, Apple may not be able to service your device. This policy is in force to prevent unauthorized persons from servicing your device without your knowledge.\n\nHow does turning off Find My iPhone prevent unauthorised persons from servicing my device?\n\nA: It prevents people from getting stolen iPhones serviced, because without the AppleID password they can't turn off \"Find My iPhone\". So your ability to turn it off is actually kind of proove that it is your phone.\nI usually do this the moment I hand over the phone in the Store.\n", "Q: How do I put individual Mac applications into sleep mode? When your Mac sleeps, it puts all apps into sleep mode. This disconnects them from the internet and halts processing in order to preserve power when power isn’t needed.\nI would like to be able to do the same for my open apps while I’m actively using my Mac, (specifically the heavy ones that take a very long time to boot up, which are incidentally the ones sucking up resources while in the background).\nIf there’s a set of terminal commands or a 3rd party application that can achieve this, I’d find it incredibly useful for conserving my battery life and CPU load during the day.\n\nA: You shouldn't need to do this on a well-behaved system. If you have specific issues with certain apps, please post separate questions for each of them so that we can find targeted ways of getting them to behave better.\nNevertheless, it is easy to suspend and resume any process:\n\n*\n\n*Determine the PID (process ID) of the app you want to suspend. You can do this via Activity Monitor, ps, top, or whatever method you want.\n\n\n*Send a SIGSTOP to that process. This will suspend the process so that it will get no CPU time. E.g., if the PID is 12345,\nkill -STOP 12345\n\n\n*When you want to resume using the app, send it a SIGCONT:\nkill -CONT 12345\nYou can also use killall to specify a process by name rather than PID. Note that, by default, this will send that signal to any process you own matching the process name.

Today I was reading about an issue with the Kaspersky Password generator (https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1412411435842519049.html).  They had an issue where the seed used was the epoch time in seconds which is a very insecure method.  I was curious about the strength of the strong passwords generated by Apple. I haven't been able to find any details on the process Apple uses to generate their passwords.  However, I did find something that really bothers me when I looked at my saved passwords.  I sorted my saved passwords alphabetically and found that the exact same generated password was used on three completely different websites.

This is my first Mac. I used the Logitech Options software to change the scroll pattern and configure the buttons. It works as intended until it stops working. The only thing that fixes it for me is restarting the MacBook. It's very annoying have to restart sometimes two times a day, especially in the middle of a busy work day.\nSometimes the scroll wheel stops working totally. I try killing the Logitech Options daemon process but that doesn't solve anything. I never had any issue with this mouse connected to my Surface devices.\nI'm ready to pull my hair out and open to solutions.\n(I've tired deleting Logitech Options and installing it again.)\n\nA: I ran into same issue since a few days with my Mm M1 and a MX 2s. The wheel stopped working after few hours and only a restart helped as the accessibility was already granted in the system settings.\nCurrently I run a looooong taking TM backup and not wanted to restart the machine.\nSo I looked into the running processes and searched for the Logi daemon and killed it.

I promise this is not a hypothetical question.

That is definitely a hardware fault. I would recommend a 3rd party repair shop local to you as it's too old to bring to Apple.\nIt's usually the flex cable that connects the display to the system board beneath the keyboard.  Or the display panel itself is damaged. You can try very gently pressing with light pressure using your finger near the bottom of the screen and see if the image changes. That might indicate the panel itself is damaged.\n\nA: I was in a very humid city (trust me it is very humid), when I exited the city I saw that it was working again.

You may find no problems using Internet Recovery at some later time.\n\nI would image that far more users create Linux installers from Windows, than from macOS. For example, the Ubuntu instructions for Windows users requires you to use Rufus to create the USB Ubuntu installer flash drive. Rufus runs on 32/64 bit Windows 7 or newer. Any Linux installer (including Ubuntu) will allow you to erase the installation drive and install a clean version of Linux. This usually is the easiest of the installation options.\n\nNote: You can also use etcher. When testing, I found etcher created an installer which boots to the Grub menu. This can be useful, if you have problems booting Ubuntu live from the installer.\n\nYou may choose to keep Windows and replace macOS with Linux. Or, keep Windows until you are sure you want whichever version of Linux you choose. In this case, the procedure to install Linux can be more complicated, if your current Windows BIOS boots. BIOS booting Windows and macOS dual boots require the installation drive to be hybrid partitioned.  The Linux installer may not work properly with hybrid partitioning in place. You may need to first boot to a live version of Linux (such as Ubuntu) and run a partition tool (such as gdisk which is include with Ubuntu) to document and remove the hybrid partitioning. Once Linux is installed, you usually can reinstate a different hybrid partitioning for a Linux and Windows dual boot.\nI suppose there a versions of Linux which are installed so as not to appear in the Mac Startup Manager. This is where the option key is held down during startup. (Ubuntu does appear in the Mac Startup Manager.) Also, many versions of Linux have an option to be installed with Grub. In these cases, you may also what to install the rEFInd Boot Manager.\n", "Q: 'Photos' app showing my pictures but not my Albums after rebuilding library \n*\n\n*MacOS 10.13.6 (high sierra)\n\n*Photos 3.0 (3291.13.230)\nI have performed a 'rebuild' of the System Library of my 'Photos' app.\nBy that, I mean that I performed the following steps :\n\n*\n\n*Closed Photos\n\n*Deleted the 'Photos Library' file from my hard drive (on my localized system this file is named 'Bilder-bibliotek')\n\n*Restarted Photos.\n\n*The app detects that the Library file is missing and makes me create a new one\n\n*Then I went to the preferences and did two things : 1) Set this new library as what Photos calls the 'system library', 2) Enabled iCloud on it (with setting 'Optimize Mac Storage' and 'Copy items to the photo library')\n\nNow this new Library file is supposed to be very much alike the one I deleted; and indeed it is : the app has started re-downloading most pictures locally and I can see them in the app, I can even scroll downwards to go backwards in time. I see that the pictures are the same as the ones I have in iCloud.com\nBut there's one problem : The albums are missing. In iCloud.com I have a bunch of albums under \"My Albums\". But in the app there's no album listed under \"My albums\".\nWhat could cause this?\nI have several hypothesis :\n- Hypothesis #1 : I'm using a localized version of Photos and the app failed to see that the albums under 'My albums' should be the same as the albums under 'Mina album' ?\n- Hypothesis #2 : I have too little hard drive space. But since the app does not give any visual feedback on what it's doing (downloading, or not finished downloading) I'm supposed to guess that \"the albums would appear if the app had enough disk space to finish the download\"\nWhat do you think?\n\nA: I have my answer.

AFAIK, it's not possible to go beyond the native resolution of the display.\nTo get the option for lower resolutions, some models require a change to lower-than-native refresh rate.\nThis is the case, for example, for my M1 MacBook Air on the Pro Display XDR: it only shows the scaled option when the Refresh Rate is changed from the native 60Hz to 59.94Hz or lower.\n", "Q: \"Macintosh HD - Data\" and \"Macintosh HD - Data - Data\" but no \"Macintosh HD\" I recently upgraded from High Sierra (10.13) to Big Sur (11.4).

Background\nAfter getting an M1 MacBook Air, I wanted to install some command-line packages. Following this blog post, I duplicated Terminal.app and set it to run with Rosetta. Using this x86_64 terminal, I installed Nix and used it to install htop, nnn, etc. These run fine in the x86_64 terminal.\nHowever, they also work in the native terminal, without arch. This makes me confused, because from reading this post, I thought I needed to add arch -x86_64 before the command to run it with Rosetta.\n\nThe file command tells me that the binary does not have a version for Apple Silicon.\nQuestion\nHow did htop run successfully?\n\nA: TL;DR: The binary itself embeds info about which architecture it is, and the OS looks at that to decide how to run it. arch is only reqired to force usage of a specific architectural variant of a universal binary.\n\nAll modern executable file formats, including the Mach-O format used by macOS, the ELF format used by most other UNIX-like systems, and the PE format used by Windows and UEFI, embed information in the file header about what CPU architecture the code in the file is for and what environment (or OS) it’s supposed to be run in.\nWhen you invoke an executable, the first thing that happens is that a part of the OS typically known as the ‘executable loader’ takes a look at the file and decides how to load it into memory and how to actually run it. The executable loader is generally reasonably smart, and can typically determine that it needs to use an interpreter or translation layer before it even loads the code into memory. A trivial example of this is the handling of scripts starting with a #!, the executable loader in the OS sees that #! line and knows it means to run the command after that and pass the path to the script as a positional argument.\nThe same logic applies for this info about what CPU architecture the executable is for. In macOS for Apple silicon, there’s a special case in the executable loader code that will try to run binaries for x86_64 CPUs using Rosetta 2 if it’s installed. If Rosetta 2 isn’t installed, you’ll just get an error message that the executable couldn’t be run, but if it is, the executable will just run seamlessly without bothering you.\nThe arch command primarily exists for the special case of running universal binaries. With the Mach-O format and the standard loader code in macOS, the OS will run the first valid version of a program in a universal binary that matches the host CPU. By using arch though, you can explicitly force the system to run the x86_64 version on a system with Rosetta 2 installed. The same could be done historically to explicitly run the 32-bit version of a binary on a 64-bit system. This sounds kind of pointless, but it’s useful for developers to verify that their universal binaries are working correctly when they only have access to one type of hardware.\n\nOn a side note, this same type of runtime flexibility can be extended even further on some platforms. Linux, for example, has a feature called binfmt_misc that lets you associate arbitrary interpreters with arbitrary file types. Historically, this originated to support things like treating JAR files as regular executables, but it’s actively used today together with QEMU userspace emulation to do the same type of thing that macOS is doing with Rosetta 2 for even more CPU architectures.\n\nA: *\n\n*If Rosetta is installed, the system will run x64 binaries automatically, you don’t need arch\n\n*arch is only required if you want to force the use of a specific version in an universal binary (containing both x64 and arm code), e.g. to run the x64 version of a binary if it relies on plugins only available in x64.\n\n", "Q: Arrow Key Navigation on iPad External Keyboard Sometimes Causes Cursor to Jump The Problem\nI am using a Logitech K480 Bluetooth keyboard with a 7th generation iPad (iPadOS 14.6) and I often notice that when I am navigating a body of text I have typed (e.g. in the Notes or Facebook apps) with the keyboard arrows the cursor will jump to the beginning of a text field if I push the up arrow twice in a particular location. It can be quite annoying when trying to navigate text I’ve typed; it’s difficult to intentionally navigate using it (or avoid it) because of the variable length of lines in paragraphs.\nThe first push of the up arrow will move the cursor one line up and then the second push will jump the cursor; it happens both immediately and if I wait. If I push the down key after the jump (again either immediately or if I wait), the cursor will jump back to the original line (i.e. the line I was on before I pushed the up key the first time). The cursor jumping behaviour will occur again in the same manner when pushing the up key twice.\nThis behaviour consistently occurs if the cursor is at the end of a line following the first up arrow push, no matter the location of the paragraph on the page or the position of the line in the paragraph.\nRelated Behaviour\nThere is some related behaviour. When using Command + left arrow to skip to the end of the line, pushing the up arrow will consistently not move the cursor to the line above but will instead jump the cursor to the beginning of the same line (pushing the down cursor subsequently will jump the cursor back to its original position at the end of the line). Sometimes when navigating a typed document with the arrow keys, a push of the up or down arrow key seems to move two lines at once.\nPossible Explanations\nTogether these behaviours and their consistency make me think this is an iPadOS ‘autoscrolling’ function, analogous to how deleting text with the onscreen keyboard speeds up the longer the backspace button is held. However, I have not found any documentation of this behaviour by Apple or anywhere else online.\nI don’t think this is a feature of the K480 keyboard; it is not listed anywhere in the Logitech documentation, and the responder to my enquiry to Logitech seemed to have no knowledge of this phenomenon (though it was a particularly unhelpful response…). My work’s IT manager thinks it is likely an iPad software feature.\nPerhaps this is just a feature of Apple devices that I’m not aware of (e.g. something that’s shared between Macs and iOS devices), but it is strange that I can’t seem to find even a mention of this behaviour.\nThe Questions\nHas anyone else observed this behaviour? Can it be customised or toggled? Is there some documentation (or personal experience) of the behaviour that lays out how it works?\n\nA: The Solution!\nAfter upgrading to iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1, this behaviour has been fixed on both my iPhone and iPad.\nScrolling with the arrow keys now functions as expected.\nIf you wish to fix the behaviour and don't have another reason against upgrading, upgrade your iOS.\n\nHow I got there:\nI enquired first with Logitech, and received no helpful answers from their standard customer service system (perhaps as expected).\nI then enquired with Apple Support and was able to talk to an Apple support technician: it turns out that Apple had no prior information on this behaviour, so this was something of a first! We hypothesised that this might have been iOS treating in-app text fields differently to word processor fields (possibly due to how the K480 keypress codes are set up).\nSince the behaviour has now been fixed, I presume they devised a solution and pushed it out with one of the iOS 15 updates.\n\nA: Use Accessibility->Keyboards->Full keyboard access, and turn off full keyboard access. This will allow arrow keys to work better, and tab key not to move between fields. It probably also disables some useful features. But working arrow keys are the most useful to me.\n", "Q: Can I safely delete the user named 'Documents' in the Sharing permissions user list? Catalina 10.15.7\nI am working on setting up the sharing of my iMac's 'Documents' folder so that I can access my documents there from my MacBook.\nUsing System Preferences>Sharing, I have added the 'Documents' folder of my user account to the 'Shared Folders' list, but when I do, a new user appears under 'Users' that is named 'Documents', and it has 'Custom' permissions.\nI do not understand this behaviour. I don't have a user or a group of users named 'Documents' - the system just made it up.\nCan someone please explain why that has happened and tell me if I can delete this \"user\" that isn't actually a user from the list?\n\nA: Short answer: Yes, you can remove the permissions given to Documents, but there is little reason to do so.\nLonger answer:\nWhen you share most folders, macOS gives the share these permissions:\n\n*\n\n*Your username: R/W\n\n*Staff group: R\n\n*Everyone: R\n\nThese follow the traditional Unix-style permissions granted to owner, group and world.\nBut when you share your Documents folder, macOS gives the share these permissions:\n\n*\n\n*Your username: R/W\n\n*Documents group: Custom permissions\n\n*Everyone: No access\n\nThe Documents group (with no members) existed on your Mac before you started sharing, but it was not exposed to view.\nThere is a similar behaviour when sharing the Desktop and some other folders.\nThe Documents and similar groups give you an easy way to control sharing on a Mac where you have multiple users.  But is likely irrelevant when there is just a single user.\nYou can change any these permissions as you see fit.  But test any changes when connecting from your other Mac.\nStrictly speaking, you would (in the Sharing preferences) be changing or removing the permission granted to the Documents group; you would not be deleting the group itself.\nYou can manage (strongly recommend look but don't change) groups and users by using the Directory Utility /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Directory Utility.app.\nFor a home network with a couple of Macs and one user, I suggest just leaving the default groups and permissions as they are.\nOne further hint: For connecting from your MacBook it could be easier (and more useful) to share your home folder rather than just Documents folder.\n", "Q: AppleScript to add a \"Space\" (as in Spaces and Exposés) in Big Sur without UI scripting I saw Using applescript to create spaces and launch apps, but the provided AppleScript didn't work.\nI did some reading to understand what was happening, and how they selected the right UI element, in case that was all that had changed. Thanks to How to know the name of UI elements using Accessibility inspector (or any other tool), I can understand how one would compose a script like this, but it feels too hacky that the best way to add a new space is via affecting a user clicking.\nI want to be able to create or delete spaces with AppleScript. Is there a better way than using AppleScript to click GUI buttons?\n\nA: In a word, \"no\".\nIf you launch Script Editor, then File → Open Dictionary and look at the list of applications there, you'll see that neither \"Mission Control\" nor \"Dock\" - the two applications most clearly responsible for spaces - show up.  This means that neither one has a scripting dictionary, which suggests there is no way to automate the creation of spaces.  \"System Events\", the catch-all for system stuff, similarly has no terminology for \"spaces\" available.\nDigging a bit deeper into API documentation, you can read a bit of interesting information about spaces from NSWorkspace, but none of that lets you do anything to spaces, only see their existing configuration. This is borne out by the available functionality in applications like Spaceman, which all let you view your Spaces, but not switch between them or create new ones.\nIt seems clear that Apple doesn't want anyone programmatically monkeying with Spaces.

And my previous corporate laptop also had not any issues with ifind. Corporate support tells that it might be a backup process, but backup is scheduled on a different time.\nThere is no logged in AppleId on this mac so it looks like it couldn't be a \"Find my mac\" process.\nDoes anyone know something about ifind?\n\nA: I was just having this issue as well, and I suspect your corporate support is correct: it likely has to do with Commvault backup software. Web searches suggest that (a) the \"ifind.exe\" process on Windows is evidently notorious for consuming CPU, and (b) ifind exists as a process for the Unix version of Commvault. (I only found references to ifind in the Solaris and FreeBSD versions, but it's reasonable to assume the Mac version was ported from their earlier Unix versions.) It looks like \"ifind\" is the process that collects changed files to be backed up.\nIf this process is \"stuck\" it's probably an issue to take up with IT.

I've encountered this same situation and, after extensive debugging, am reasonably sure that it's a result of specifically the built-in storage device overheating. (Though, in my case, I was able to swap out the old storage for new storage. I'm not sure if leaving the old storage in will trigger this issue.)\nThe sleep-reason routing appears to have been obviously incorrectly implemented for this state, as in both of our cases the system was not battery-powered. It is very misleading.\nAdditionally, your disk is 7 years old, which under average usage is considered very high risk of failure for consumer-grade storage.

I noticed that no matter how much I used it, the fans barely ramped up. Using iStat Menus I noticed that it would usually stay around its base speed of 1800 rpm (0% of the fan speed range), and go up to 2000 (7%) rpm under heavy load. It would never reach the maximum of 4845 rpm (100%) unless I manually set it using iStat Menus.\nTo stress test the CPU I tried running 16 instances of yes > /dev/null &, play an 8K video on YouTube, and compress a video on Handbrake. Definitely more than necessary but my fans still didn't ramp up after a few hours of testing. This is what my stats looked like during the hour that I checked in with it:\nGeneral temperatures, power usage, fan speed, and other stats:\n\nCPU Usage (left) and fan Speed, around 2000 rpm (right)\n \nPower usage, hovering around 28W:\n\nWhat's quite surprising is the thermal limit, it seems like it doesn't want to go past 85°C whereas every other Apple CPU I've seen gets close to the max junction temperature (usually 105°C) before the fans start kicking in to keep it from throttling.\nOne suspicion I have is that for some reason my CPU is being throttled or underclocked for some reason. If so, how do I prevent this from happening?\n\nA: What the OP has effectively demonstrated is that Apple's extensive efforts and expenditure towards building out a thermal management solution that covers the entire performance envelope have been successful. The Mac is behaving precisely as it was designed to: By applying the least amount of active cooling necessary to maintain safe operating temperatures at any given load. There are multiple whole teams at Apple whose entire job description is to make this a reality.\nAs others have said in the comments, you may not even be able to induce a sufficiently high load to exceed your Mac's active cooling capacity and force throttling in your current environmental conditions. In order to test that your machine will, indeed, spool up to a 100% fan duty cycle, you will need to place your device in a container with as little ambient airflow as possible and let your load run a while. At some point you will notice the fans at max and the die temps rising and the throttling kicking in, eventually followed by an emergency thermal shutdown.\n\nA: \n... but my fans still didn't ramp up after a few hours of testing.\n\nThe slow fan speed ramp-up is by design. As the CPU crunches data and heats up, the Mini will not immediately increase the fan speed. Instead it will wait for sometime to allow its metal body to act like a secondary heat sink and absorb some of the heat. And only after that will it slowly increase the fan speed to further cool down the CPU.\nPersonally, I've felt that the default Apple settings for heat management, while really ideal for the majority use cases on Mac, aren't the most optimal when you really want full CPU performance. One of the things Apple's marketing likes to highlight is that the mac is \"quiet\" and you can \"barely\" hear the CPU fan. So to meet this design need of \"quiet and thus less distracting\" computers, I feel they do resort to more CPU throttling than necessary, and a slower ramp of the fan speed to reduce the fan noise, at the slight expense of CPU performance. (This is more true for the Apple laptops than their desktop counterpart though, unless you have made custom modifications to your desktop Mac).\n(Note: Be careful in messing with the default fan speeds and / or CPU voltage settings to overclock the CPUs. It can reduce the life of the CPU fan and the CPU and in worst cases even damage it. And Apple parts and repair costs are very high.)\n\nOne suspicion I have is that for some reason my CPU is being throttled or underclocked for some reason. If so, how do I prevent this from happening?\n\nEven I find it hard to believe that your CPU doesn't cross 85 degrees with what you described. Though, I do have a doubt if you are stressing your CPU enough. The Youtube video maybe being decoded by the hardware decoder in the CPU. If you use a hardware encoder (VideoToolbox) on Handbrake the encoding will be done by the hardware encoder on the CPU, and not by the CPU cores.\nOne way to really use all the CPU cores fully, for a while, would be to encode a movie using x265 / HEVC encoding. HEVC encoding is very CPU intensive and is a good way to stress your CPU.\nOpen any 720p or above 1+ hour long movie in Handbrake. In the Video tab, choose H.265 (x265) in the \"Video Codec\" drop-down menu. Choose a Quality / CRF of 18. And most important, set the encoder / H.265 \"Preset\" to \"veryslow\". Now start encoding.\nThis should easily use up all the CPU cores to 100% and in just 5-10 minutes cause the CPU to touch 100 degrees at room temperature (28 to 35 degrees here).\nIf that doesn't happen, it's a good guess that some CPU throttling is happening.\n\nIntel Power Gadgets\nThe Intel Power Gadgets app is very useful for more accurate monitoring of the CPU while stress testing it.\nIt also has built-in test suites to test both the CPU and GPU\nTo run the tests:\n\n*\n\n*Open Intel Power Gadgets.\n\n*In the Test menu, select All Thread Frequency under CPU Tests.\n\n*In the Test menu, select Maximum Frequency under Intel Graphics Tests.\n\n*A check mark will appear on the selected menu item and the tests will start.\n\n*To stop the test, open the Test menu and click again on the menu item with the check marks.

It is really irritating to have to one at a time delete hundreds of cookies/caches from websites I have never visited. (Would that Apple would allow us to block third-party cookies).\nIs there an API that would allow me to build my own app in Xcode to handle it in a better way? Or something like Cookie 6 (macOS) for iOS? Or someone else’s open source that I can compile?\nI’m not willing to jailbreak, nor to install something with source code not vetted by me or Apple.\nFor example, clearing all website data and then logging in to Facebook.com adds five third-party cookies.  Three of them are from domains owned by Facebook, but do not end in Facebook.com.  The other two are obviously from advertising services.\n\nThis is why I use DuckDuckGo for almost everything, and Safari only occasionally.  DuckDuckGo lets me clear everything after a session.  I use Safari for a few domains where I’d like to keep their cookies only, but the cost of that is consumption of storage space that doesn’t benefit me and prevents syncing all the music I’d like.\nThe cookies are less irritating than the consumption of limited storage space.  But if third-party cookies are accepted, cross-site tracking is implied.  Since I cleared all website data (recently), I have not visited any site with “math” in the name.  Only Facebook, UniGen.us, and three SE subdomains. Yet I have a cookie from mathoverflow.com  And Safari says it’s size is zero bytes.  Obviously, it is at least one byte.  But more of an issue are the megabytes of third-party local storage resulting in updates and Music syncs failing for insufficient space.\n\nA: Safari already blocks third-party cookies by default. Check yours is in Settings → Safari → Prevent Cross-Site Tracking.\nThere are no APIs for interacting with data from the Safari app, only for web views within the app itself. Therefore there’s nothing third party apps can do without jailbreaking.\n\nA: Yes, as a user it is very infuriating that Apple does not allow other browsers on ios / iPadOS with better privacy features (all browsers on ios have to use Safari's Webkit rendering engine, and thus all of them suffer from similar limitations).\nTo better safeguard your privacy on ios / iPadOS, I recommend the following -\n\n*\n\n*Disable Safari on iCloud.\n\n\n*Install AdGuard and,\n\n\n*Enable Private Browsing on Safari.\nPros of this approach:\n\n*\n\n*Adguard is designed to blocks ads and trackers on Safari in an Apple approved safe manner.\n\n\n*Since most of the ad and tracker scripts are blocked, websites load faster. And when they are blocked, they can't install their unwanted cookies too.\n\n\n*By using Private Browsing mode on Safari, you ensure that whenever you close Safari, or any Tab on Safari, all website data (including cookies) is deleted immediately.\n\n\n*Preventing Safari from syncing to iCloud prevents previous (or other device) Safari website data from being loaded into Safari on your ios, from iCloud.\nCons:\n\n*\n\n*On rare occasions, some websites don't work properly when ads and / or trackers are blocked. This is rare, but Safari provides an easy fix - it has an option to reload the website again without any content blocking.\n\n\n*In Private Browsing mode, no history or auto-fill information is saved. Moreover, since it deletes all websites data, you cannot be always logged in.\n\n\n*Some ad networks hate Private browsing mode. Websites that use them will thus sometimes show banners / pop-ups blocking the site partially. Adguard takes care of most of these annoyances, but some still slip through. (I have noticed this mostly on large online media sites).\nI find this approach as a good compromise on convenience vs privacy on the ios platform.\n\nIf you want build and customise your own browser for ios, Firefox Focus is a decent open source browser you can use for your project - source code for Firefox Focus for iOS is available on Github.\n", "Q: BT headsets with no lag I have a Logitech H390 headset on my trashcan MP. These are quite nice for general purpose telecommuting and gaming. I find many sets clamp onto your head and are very uncomfortable for long use, the H390 is much softer fitting.\nHowever, the H390 is corded, and the cord is long enough that I run over it with my chair, causing the headset to get yanked. Now it's broken - they are not terribly strong to begin with, and fall apart even if you don't yank them. So I'm looking for a BT set to avoid this particular problem.\nPoking about here I see posts about sound delays in BT speakers. Is this also a problem with headsets? Is anyone out there using an entry or mid-level BT headset and can confirm/deny that they work OK and have no lag?\n\nA: We use those at work a don’t have any issues unless people have low batteries, or noisy interference from household appliances or 2.4 GHz congestion in WiFi. They aren’t as good as Apple radios but better than most.\nTry a USB external BTLE dongle or update the firmware on the device if you continue to have disconnects and lag. That is needed for some of our Logitech units.\n", "Q: Get total \"Screen On Usage\" since last full charge On my M1 MacBook Air I can check the \"Screen On Usage\" for the last 10 days:\n\nWhat I would be interested in is how much time I spent actively using the machine since I last charged to 100%.\nOf course I could combine the information visible here, and try to estimate from the bar chart how many minutes I have spent per day - but this is tedious and not very exact, as the axis of the lower graph only shows intervals of one hour.\nIs there any better way to get this information without having to resort to commercial apps? Obviously the information I need is available, but I do not know where to find it.\n\nA: I googled some more and apparently it is possible to get this information from the output of pmset -g log, although this is still not easy to parse.\nIn these log messages one can find messages like these:\n2021-07-14 17:59:16 +0200 Notification          Display is turned off                                                                 \n\n2021-07-14 17:59:47 +0200 Notification          Display is turned on                                                                  \n\nas well as messages including the current charge:\n2021-07-08 22:56:24 +0200 DarkWake              DarkWake from Deep Idle [CDNPB] : due to SMC.OutboxNotEmpty smc.70070000 USB-C_plug/ Using AC (Charge:100%) 6 secs    \n\nSo I wrote a small Python script to parse these log messages and compute the total time of the display turned on since the laptop was last unplugged.\nIf anyone is interested, the code is available at GitHub.\nBut if there are better/easier/fancier alternatives out there, I'm still interested in trying them out!\n", "Q: How to get Firefox ad blocking performance from Safari? Am I comparing apples to oranges?\nA view of the same site - one in Safari and one in Firefox.  Firefox settings on Strict and Safari is Content Blockers enabled.  Arent these 2 setting suppose to do the same thing?  If so, clearly Firefox does a better job.  Is there a way to get the Firefox like performace (no ads) in Safari (w/o a third party blocker)?\nFirefox version is 89.0.2   and Safari is  Version 14.1.1 (15611.2.7.1.6, 15611)\nCatalina 10.15.7\nSafari Browser\n\nFirefox Browser\n\n\nA: Safari’s content blocking functionality provides an API for third-party apps to provide block lists. Safari provides various functionality for blocking cookies and preserving privacy, but does not perform ad blocking by itself.\nGet an extension for Safari (such as from the App Store or elsewhere online) that provides a content blocking extension and configure the Safari extension to block ads.\n\nApps tell Safari in advance what kinds of content to block. Because Safari doesn't have to consult with the app during loading, and because Xcode compiles content blockers into bytecode, this model runs efficiently. Additionally, content blockers have no knowledge of users' history or the websites they visit.\n\n\nA: An alternative to using Safari's content blocking, is to use AdGuard for Mac. This runs as a separate process and intercepts network traffic from any app (you specify which apps). I have mine configured to block ads (and trackers) in all browsers, News Explorer (my news reader) and DEVONthink.\nBy design the app is watching all browsing and all components in a web page. So you have to trust AdGuard to maintain your privacy, but there has been no suggestion of AdGuard breaching that trust. But you are already trusting Apple and Mozilla.\nFor me, the benefits of a system-wide ad and tracking blocker outweigh any risks around trust.\n\nA: You can achieve this result using, for example, PiHole. You use it as DNS server for your home connection and all devices connecting to the internet via your home network will have ads removed. This is the result I get for the site you have shown:\n\nThis is not Mac or Safari specific, works with any computer and any browser. It also gives a nice dashboard to check which devices connect to your networks and how much dns requests were blocked as ads.\n", "Q: Disable Control+Space keyboard shortcut By default, in macOS the keyboard shortcut Control+Space is enabled for switching keyboard input method such as Qwerty versus Dvorak.\nI cannot remember the way to disable this default behavior.

I disabled that setting, but still, since then, the Username field comes up empty and I have to fill it in every time.\nAny idea of how can I go back to having a default Admin Username filled in automatically?\nSome further detail and things I have tried:\n\n*\n\n*I'm in macOS Big Sur 11.4, but as stated, the default Admin username had been there across OS versions for as long as I can remember.\n\n*I'm in a non-Admin account, obviously. There is only 1 Admin account in the machine, also owned by me, rarely used.\n\n*I tried logging in as the Admin account. In there, the authentication dialogs do fill in the Admin's name by default.\n\n*I have tried turning on and off Fast User switch, the showing of names in the log in screen, have recreated the TouchID fingerprints of the Admin account, and logged that account into its AppleID account. Nothing helped.\n\n\nA: I think, if you are not logged with an Admin account, then the system asks for the Admin name and password.\n", "Q: Custom \"copy as Pathname\" in Finder Is there a way to somehow customize \"copy as Pathname\" in Finder (write-click, option, ...) so that the pathname that is copied is modified (e.g. to replace my username with somebody else's)?\n\nA: \nAny tips on how to approach this with Automator?\n\nThe example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested in Script Editor and as an Automator Service/Quick Action under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes any necessary and or appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nThe following example AppleScript code can be used In Automator Service/Quick Action setting Workflow receives current [files or folders] in [Finder] and adding a Run AppleScript action replacing the default code with the example AppleScript code and setting the Options of the Run AppleScript action to: [√] Ignore this action's input\nAs currently coded you can set the diffShortUserName variable to whatever, it's currently foobar, or you can comment out the first line of code and uncomment the commented block of code, which will present a dialog box for you to enter a different short user name each time you use the Automator Service/Quick Action.\nThis will place on the clipboard the POSIX pathname of any selected files or folders in the frontmost window of Finder, from anywhere in your Home folder.\n\nExample AppleScript code:\nset diffShortUserName to \"foobar\"\n\n(*\nset diffShortUserName to \"\"\nrepeat while diffShortUserName is \"\"\n    set diffShortUserName to ¬\n        text returned of (display dialog ¬\n        \"Different Short User Name:\" default answer \"\")\nend repeat\n*)\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to ¬\n    set selectedFiles to ¬\n        (selection as alias list)\n\nset myShortUserName to short user name of (system info)\nset selectedFilesCount to count selectedFiles\nset thePathnamesList to {}\n\nrepeat with thisFile in selectedFiles\n    \n    set thePathname to the POSIX path of thisFile\n    \n    if thePathname contains \"/Users/\" & myShortUserName & \"/\" then\n        \n        set {TID, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to ¬\n            {AppleScript's text item delimiters, myShortUserName}\n        set foo to text items of thePathname\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to diffShortUserName\n        set thePathname to foo as string\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to TID\n        \n        if selectedFilesCount is greater than 1 then\n            copy thePathname & linefeed to end of thePathnamesList\n        else\n            copy thePathname to end of thePathnamesList\n        end if\n        \n    end if\n    \nend repeat\n\nset the clipboard to thePathnamesList as string\n\nNotes:\nIf you are looking to replace your short user name that is elsewhere in the POSIX pathname of any selected files or folders in the frontmost window of Finder not in your Home folder, then additional coding will be necessary.\nOne can also assign a keyboard shortcut to the Automator Service/Quick Action in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, however, some prefer to use a third-party application that is capable of running AppleScript code and assigning a keyboard shortcut to it.\nAs an example, I use FastScripts for some tasks, as well as Hammerspoon for other tasks. (I am not associated with the developers of these products, just a satisfied user.)\nThis is also why I've coded it in the manner I did, removing the default code and setting the option in the action I did, as it makes the example AppleScript code available to work in the different methods in which it can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

Oracle Virtual Box is a free product and VMware Fusion Player does offers free licenses. Windows 10 can be downloaded, installed and used for free without a product key for short periods of time. Certainly, long enough to copy the needed files or change permissions. Afterwards, you can delete the virtual machine to regain used space. Both Virtual Box and Fusion Player require  very little space so there is no advantage to removing either software application.\nYou may avoid using a virtual machine by just booting your Mac from a Windows 10 installer flash drive or DVD. This may require the Windows Support Software to be installed on the same or different flash drive. Once booted, you can open a Command Prompt window. If you are familiar with Windows commands, you could copy the files to another FAT, ExFAT or NTFS volume. Or, change the permissions.\n\nA: It's probably a permission error. Try putting chmod 644 /path/to/file\" in terminal and see if it fixes up the perms. If that doesn't work try chmod 666 /path/to/file. If that doesn't work, it's probably something else. However, to change the perms the disk needs to be writable, meaning you need ntfs-3g to mount the NTFS disk as writable\nNTFS-3G: https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/NTFS-3G\n", "Q: MacBook Pro keeps restarting Filevault is enabled.\nNot able to login restarts again and again.\nAnd already have run first aid.\nNot able to reinstall macOS.\nshows your computer restarted because of a problem.\nMacBook Pro mid 2012.\n\nA: Many Macbook Pro mid 2012 have a problem of Sata Cable.

I'm creating a slideshow project on my Mac via Photos.app\nI've added 300+ images to the slideshow. I want them to appear in a random order. Randomization of a slideshow should be an extremely commonly desired feature.\nHowever, Photos.app does not appear to have any option to randomize or shuffle the photos. I'm able to manually re-order the timeline of photos at the bottom, but that's too much work for a large slideshow.\nHow can I display a randomized slideshow in macOS Photos?\n\n\nA: Strangely enough, this feature doesn't exist in macOS Photos. A couple of workarounds:\n\n*\n\n*Create an album containing the slideshow photos > Go to System Preferences > Desktop and Screensaver > Albums > select the album you created > Specify the transition time > \"Random order\" box will become enabled > Check mark it.\n\n\n*Try this AppleScript: http://oldtoad.net/ASC/RandomSortSlideshow.zip\nOf course, you could export the photos and use one of the many slideshow generator programs to shuffle, add music etc.\n", "Q: prompt not showing on terminal I installed jdk and somehow modified my path and now my terminal no longer has a prompt, it just says \"Last login: Wed Jul 14 15:28:10 on console\"\nI created another user on my mac and that one has the correct prompt on the terminal.  but i need to know how to fix it on my original user .\nis there a way i can modify my user when im logged in as the other user in order to fix this ?\n\nA: i used Ctrl, Shift . to see my hidden files and deleted my .bash_profile file which had some java things in there that i had put by mistake and now its fixed\n", "Q: Where does Mail.app store the email addresses/aliases for your own accounts?

I am trying to stop my MacOS from periodically checking for updates and displaying these notifications:\n\n\nI have unchecked seemingly all relevant checkboxes in App Store preferences:\n\nAnd in System Preferences / Software Update as well:\n\nYet every time I open the latter it defiantly checks for updates:\n\nHow do I get it obey my directions? I am aware that some updates are required to actually fix security issues (as opposed to enhance the telemetry / data collection / spying etc. for the benefit of Apple). Yet I expect the OS to do what it apparently supposed to: not to check for updates if the checkboxes are unchecked (otherwise why would those checkboxes exist in the first place?). I am happy to take the risk to live without updates where I choose to, and I do not need Apple to override my decision.\nThis is Big Sur 11.3.1 (20E241).\n\nA: *\n\n*The App Store preference only controls the automatic update, not the checking whether an update is available. The later happens automatically\n\n*Software Update checks when you open the panel, independent of the \"automatic\" setting. If it detects an update it shows it in the menu\n\nSo basically it works in the way defined in the preferences.\nPS: Some of the answers on How can I permanently disable App Store notifications in Big Sur? might be useful\n\nA: If you wanted to prevent the OS from checking the software update catalog, you could try changing the catalog's URL:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL http://www.example.com\n\n... and then when you have somehow satisfied yourself that updates are ok, you can manually check for them, by removing the preference key:\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL \n\nNote that the OS will not be able to find any system updates until the catalog is restored.\n(You may want to keep a copy of the unmodified /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist, just in case.)\nAlternatively, you could just auto-install and roll back if concerns are discovered about an update.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2019 overheating with external monitor Problem\nMy Macbook overheats insanely.\nAfter investigating a bit, I found out that the correlation is extremely strong with having it plugged in to an external monitor with the Macbook Pro monitor also active.\nIf I unplug the laptop, or use only the external monitor (i.e. Mac in a 'clamshell' mode), the heating stops within a minute.\nI managed to use a software (sudo powermetrics --samplers smc |grep -i \"CPU die temperature\") to measure this:\n\n*\n\n*Indoor temperature: 23C\n\n*CPU heat without external monitor: 55C\n\n*CPU heat with external monitor + macbook monitor on: 95C (fan turns on)\n\n*CPU heat with external monitor, macbook closed: 62C\n\nDetails of hardware\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro (16-inch, 2019). 2.3 Ghz 8-Core Intel Core i9, 16 GB 2667 MHz DDR, AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 4GB, Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB\n\n*macOS BigSur 11.4\n\n*Monitor: HP E233. 23-inch (1920 x 1080)\n\n*Cables connecting: UGREEN USB C Hub HDMI USB C Adapter with 4K HDMI, 3 USB 3.0, SD/TF Card Reader (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07RRPS5NT/), and then a standard HDMI-cable\n\nTried fixes that didn't work\n\n*\n\n*Restart\n\n*SMC reset\n\n*Never use two monitors (works)\n\nHow could I fix this so I can use two monitors also in the future?\n\nA: Try this:\n\n*\n\n*Update to latest macos Monterey\n\n*Go to Settings -> Battery => Check the Low power mode both for Battery and Power adapter\n\n*On using two 4k monitors, if possible use ports on left/right foreach monitor\n\nGood Luck!\n\nA: As a MacBook Pro owner, I had the same problem. After a lot of researching, I discovered that our MacBooks have an architectural error: when plugged, an external monitor is always controlled by the dedicated GPU (the AMD Radeon, in my case).\nSo, as the dedicated GPU is more power-consuming and tends to heat more than the integrated one, our laptops are always overheating when connected to an external monitor.\nSources:\n\n*\n\n*https://dnsmichi.at/2022/01/10/macbook-pro-16-2019-heat-problem-with-external-display/\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/444119/468509\n\nA: try this:\n\n*\n\n*go to [System Preferences] -> [Displays];\n\n*go to [Displays Settings] if you are using both built-in monitor and external monitor, otherwise there is not [Displays Settings] and you will see the detail info of the current monitor instead.\n\n*remember the Color Profile of the built-in monitor. set the external monitor's Color Profile to the same as the built-in one.\n\n\nA: In my case, the culprit was a mismatch between the frame rates of external and built-in displays (50 and 60 Hz, respectively).

Either when installing or on first run, you will be asked to grant the Screen Recording permission. Make sure you are using the current version 2.9 Skitch.\n\nA: I initially installed Skitch via Homebrew Cask, but until today have had ongoing issues where Skitch kept loosing permission despite, going in and disabling then enabling again and having it work for a short period of time.\nToday ran brew cask uninstall skitch and instead now downloaded it from Mac AppStore.

For example, we can add memory usage:\n% TIMEFMT+='  max RSS %M'\n% time        \nshell  0.22s user 0.10s system 53% cpu 0.601 total  max RSS 6120\nchildren  0.11s user 0.16s system 45% cpu 0.601 total  max RSS 3056\n% time sleep 0\nsleep 0  0.00s user 0.00s system 61% cpu 0.003 total  max RSS 580\n% \n\nExternal Command time\nThe external command time can be used as follows:\n% command time\n% command time sleep 0 \n        0.00 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys\n% command time -p sleep 0 \nreal         0.00\nuser         0.00\nsys          0.00\n% command time -l sleep 0  # Add memory usage\n        0.00 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys\n              585728  maximum resident set size\n                   0  average shared memory size\n                   0  average unshared data size\n                   0  average unshared stack size\n                 160  page reclaims\n                   0  page faults\n                   0  swaps\n                   0  block input operations\n                   0  block output operations\n                   0  messages sent\n                   0  messages received\n                   0  signals received\n                   0  voluntary context switches\n                   1  involuntary context switches\n             2198249  instructions retired\n             3195521  cycles elapsed\n              237568  peak memory footprint\n%\n\nreal here is the same as total, above.\n", "Q: Parsing text, \"line by line\", with automator I'm very new to programming so pardon me if this is a very simple question, but I'm trying to create an automator workflow where the variable would change with each loop, pulling the inputs from a textedit document.\n(and also, I'm creating the text edit document, so if formatting it differently would make this easier let me know)\nFor example, I have a text edit document with several numbers, all 3 digits, separated by line breaks, like this:\n001\n005\n009\n013\n014\n021\nI'd like automator to run a workflow the first time with the variable as \"001\", then again with variable as \"005\", then a 3rd time as \"009\" and so on. And if it makes things easier I can format it to be all on one line separated by commas, surrounded by brackets, whatever is best.\nI know a little bit of javascript and AppleScript, so if this is something solved with a run Javascript or AppleScript box, that is totally cool. Thanks!\n\nA: Since it is not totally clear what is the full scope of what you are trying to accomplish, the following example AppleScript code is meant as a proof of concept.\nWith a plain text document name Filename.txt in the Documents folder containing:\n001\n005\n009\n013\n014\n021\n\nWith having no linefeed after the last line, here is something you might be able to adapt to achieve your goal.\nThe example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested in Script Editor under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\n\n\nExample AppleScript code\nset theFile to ¬\n    the POSIX path of ¬\n        (((path to documents folder) ¬\n            as string) & \"Filename.txt\")\n\nset myList to ¬\n    paragraphs of (read theFile)\n\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    activate\n    make new document\n    delay 2\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with thisItem in myList\n        keystroke thisItem\n        key code 36 --  # Enter key\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nProduces the following:\n\nLooking in the Results pane of the Script Editor window, it shows:\ntell current application\n    path to documents folder\n        --> alias \"Macintosh HD:Users:me:Documents:\"\n    read \"/Users/me/Documents/Filename.txt\"\n        --> \"001\n005\n009\n013\n014\n021\"\nend tell\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    activate\n    make new document\n        --> document \"Untitled\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"001\"\n    key code 36\n    keystroke \"005\"\n    key code 36\n    keystroke \"009\"\n    key code 36\n    keystroke \"013\"\n    key code 36\n    keystroke \"014\"\n    key code 36\n    keystroke \"021\"\n    key code 36\nend tell\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: How to implement or mimic https with Homebrew Apache? So, I'm working on trying to develop a site using the location API and modern browsers either require you to make settings modifications, or to run the geolocation requests through https. I was wondering if there's a way of mimicing https locally, that would avoid installing let's encrypt? I don't want to manage tons of certificates locally if not absolutely necessary.\n\nA: So, digging around tutorials, I learned about Make Cert, which you install with Brew like this: brew install mkcert nss. The NSS package is so it plays nicely with Firefox.\n", "Q: How do I delete a key in a plist if I have the key value? I have a plist like so:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Delete Me</key>\n    <string>1</string>\n    <key>Keep Me</key>\n    <string>1</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nHow do I delete the key-pair \"Delete Me\"?\n\nA: defaults delete /path/to/file Delete\\ Me\n\nFWIW, I'd avoid having spaces in the keynames. You could try single quotes instead of escaping it.\nAlso: you don't need the file extension .plist in the filepath.\nAlternatively, you can open it in BBEdit or Xcode (both of which will handle conversion to and from binary plists on the fly) and delete the relevant portion (key and string) directly. Other text editors may also do the same.\n", "Q: Intel iMac freezes halfway through boot After a recent power cut, my late 2018 iMac can't seem to complete a normal boot process. About halfway through the booting progress bar, it hangs and doesn't make any more progress.\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n*\n\n*Resetting the NVRAM\n\n*Resetting the SMC\n\n*Booting in safe mode (it boots but up is VERY slow), then restarting normally.\n\n*Booting in recovery mode and doing first aid via Disk Utility (no issues).\n\n*Booting in safe mode and doing first aid via Disk Utility (no issues).\n\n*Reinstalling Big Sur Beta (I'm in the beta program). The install never completed because in one of the restarts during install the boot stalled halfway.\n\nI've read through this similar thread here. But it's very old and nothing in there helped.\n\nA: Even though Disk First Aid has reported no issues, I would test booting from an external drive.\nIf the problem persists, then you know it's related to some other part of the hardware.\nIf the problem is not apparent, then the internal hard drive is at fault.\nIf you have a mechanical hard drive (as part of a Fusion volume), then it's entirely likely that it might be failing.\n\nA: In the end, I booted in verbose mode and was seeing disk I/O errors. Then I booted in diagnostics mode and saw no issues so I'm guessing the power cut corrupted my boot drive.\nSo I went ahead and reformatted the disk, and did a fresh install of my systems original MacOS version using cmd+option+shift+R (recovery mode that defaults to the originally installed version of MacOS).\nFingers crossed that the disk isn't failing.\n", "Q: Terminal profile text antialiasing option ignored after initial window I'm having a strange issue with Terminal profiles that I can't seem to get to the bottom of.\nFor some reason the 'Antialias text' option is only being observed for the initial Terminal window. So if I quit Terminal entirely and open it again, the first window has no antialiasing on the text as I have the 'Antialias text' checkbox unticked. However, if I create a new window or tab the text is antialiased.\n\nTop: Initial window with correct rendering. Bottom: New window with antialiasing option ignored.\nIf I keep both windows open and toggle Antialias text on and off only the initial window changes. If I change the text colour, both windows change.\nWhat I've Tried\n\n*\n\n*Removed everything from my .bash_profile including my custom PS1\n\n*Switched the shell back to zsh\n\n*Reset all the profiles and only changed the default profile to Pro\n\nNone of these had any effect.\nI don't recall having this issue on my previous MacBook Pro on Catalina and I'm quite confident I would have noticed. I think it's possibly a bug that's been introduced on Big Sur.\n\nA: Not really an answer, but I saw the same issue and I'd really like to fix it. For me, it is less predictable, and I see additional strangeness. It seems to be related to external monitors.\nExample:\nMoving to the native MacBook Air display cleans it up.  Moving from an external monitor to another external makes the original clean window antialiased. Sometimes even the new/fresh window doesn't come up clean (sometimes it does.)\n", "Q: Comparing files within a folder I have a folder with many book files in different formats e.g. .txt, .epub, .rtf, etc.\nMany of them are duplicates but have different names e.g.:\nBrooks, Terry - Shannara 1 - The Sword of Shannara.txt\nBrooks, Terry - Shannara 01 - The Sword of Shannara.txt\nIf I check these files with filemerge they are exactly the same file.\nI have tried running several programs like Gemini on the folder in question with no results.\nEvery suggestion online seems to involve comparing two folders. I do NOT want to compare two folders. I only want to find the duplicate files within a directory or its sub-directories.\nI was looking for a script or terminal command to loop through the folder(s) and show which files have the same content even though they may have different filenames, creation dates, modification dates, etc.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n[edit] - I should clarify that I want to find a way to compare two files even though they may be named differently but are of the same type. e.g. text files, or epub files. I do not wish to compare them between types a text file and an epub, of couse, would be different.\n\nA: fdupes may be your solution. It can be installed via homebrew with\nbrew install fdupes\n\nIf you don’t have homebrew, you can install homebrew with\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nRunning fdupes -r <directory> will list duplicate files within the directory, even if they’re not in the same folder. fdupes compares based on file contents, not names, so the names being different will not be a problem.\nYou can use the -d option to be prompted which files to keep (deleting all others), but I would suggest doing the deletions manually.\n"]
