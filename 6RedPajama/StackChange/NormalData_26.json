["Q: Removing a Word From the Spellcheck Dictionary Somehow, the word procede has made its way into my OS X system as a correctly spelled word.  If I type it in Text Edit, BBEdit, or Mail, the spell checker will not mark it with red underlines.\n\nHow can I fix this?  That is, how can I have my system correctly flag this word as incorrect spelled? The word does not appear in my \n~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary\n\nfile.  My system has no files in \n/Library/Spelling\n\nI've stared at the spelling and grammar options in multiple applications and don't see any obvious ways to tell the system to remove a word from the dictionary. \n\n\nA: Whilst many words are in ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary, there's also words contained in the localisation that you are currently in, such as en or en_GB.\nTry looking in such files for the word. You can find which file it's in using the following Terminal command:\ngrep -lr \"procede\" ~/Library/Spelling/\n\n\nA: Open up TextEdit. If not presented with an “Open…” dialog, select “Open File…” from the “File” menu or press ⌘O (an oh, not a zero).  Press ⇧⌘G then copy ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary and paste that text into the location panel; click \"Go\" or press enter, then press enter again or click \"Open\". You should be presented with a series of “learned words”, one per line.\nEdit to your satisfaction. I took an opportunity to add many of my project names; all odd-looking nouns like cinje and korcu…  When done, save the file if needed, and close.\nOpen up your Terminal.app.  (Via Spotlight is easiest, or you'll find it in /Applications/Utilities via Finder.)  Enter the following and press return:\nps x | grep Spell\n\nYou should see something similar to the following on your screen, don't worry if yours is missing the grep line:\n53535   ??  S      0:02.68 /System/Library/Services/AppleSpell.service/Contents/MacOS/AppleSpell\n70766 s002  R+     0:00.00 grep --colour Spell\n\nThe first number on the line containing the reference to AppleSpell.service from your own output you'll need to remember for the next command:\nkill -HUP 53535\n\nReplacing 53535 with your own number.  This instructs the \"spelling service\" to \"hang up\" and reload its configuration and data files, making the changes you made to the data file effective.\n\nA: I'm still not sure what the ultimate reason for this is, but I was able to fix this problem by going to \nEdit -> Spelling -> Show Spelling Panel\n\nand changing the selected dictionary from Automatic By Language to U.S. English. \n", "Q: Thunderbolt to VGA connector makes my MacBook Pro Retina very hot I have a new Macbook pro retina display, i7, 16 GB RAM and NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M.\nI have noticed that when running Boot Camp with Win 7 and I plug in my HP VGA monitor using a VGA/thunderbolt adaptor, the top area above the function keys get extremely hot.\nI have made sure I have the most up to date drivers for my graphics card but still the issue persists.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\nA: Well your macbook is simply utilizing the nvidia video card and that produces more heat.  Since you are running Windows it may not be using resources as efficiently as your MacOS.  \nYour macbook typically runs off the onboard video card and switches to the hotter running nvidia for intensive apps/games.\nThere are many posts regarding macs running hot using windows:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=883774\n", "Q: How do I disable private browsing in Safari One of my friends has a child who is being overly sneaky online (imagine that). She wants to disable the ability for her child to select \"Private Browsing\" in Safari. In her opinion, Parental Controls are too limiting for a teenager, but Private Browsing is too permissive. Is there a terminal command or other way to do this on OS X?\n(Of note: I did see the trick of using Interface Builder to edit the NIB file to delete the option from the Safari Menu, but I think it would be beyond her tech ability to perform those steps. I also doubt she'd want to install Xcode).\nThanks for you help!\n\nA: I could suggest something more evil : \nEnable parental controls and use the logs ! \nSomeone on Apple Support asked if private browsing disabled logging. It appears no, the parents controls will still log the websites. Even if the sneaky kids enable the private browsing, the logs will spill the beans ! \n\nA: If logging isn't practical or you want to be more proactive and prevent Private Browsing from being accessible in the first place, it is possible (though not a short process) to disable Private Browsing if you are willing to mess with Safari's internal files.\nNote that macOS 10.12+ will not allow you to modify, overwrite, or delete Safari. You can make the following modifications to a copy of Safari and put that version in the Dock, but the original Safari will still need to exist in the Applications folder.\nInstall the necessary files\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Xcode (available in the App Store)\n\n*Download a zip file of Nib-Decompiler from GitHub (or clone the repository if you know how to do that)\n\n*Open the NibDecompiler.xcodeproj Xcode project in Xcode\n\n*Compile the project. This will produce a file named NibDecompiler.action. You can now close the project.\n\n*Copy NibDecompiler.action into ~/Library/Automator*\n\n*From your download, copy NibDecompiler.workflow into ~/Library/Services*\n\n\nRemove the \"New Private Window\" option from the menu bar\nNote that this involves editing the Safari internal files. You will need to redo these steps every time you update Safari. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Safari in the Finder and right-click \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*This will open the app as if it were a folder. Go to Contents, then Resources, then Base.lproj folder.\n\n*Find MainMenu.nib. Copy it outside of the package somewhere (like the Desktop). \n\n*Right-click on the file and choose \"NibDecompiler\". The file will be made editable.\n\n*Open the file in Xcode (should be double-clickable)\n\n*In the window with the Safari menu, choose \"Safari\" to expand it.\n\n*Click on the \"New Private Window\" menu item.\n\n*Hit the delete key to see it disappear.\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Back in the Base.lproj folder of the Safari app, make a copy MainMenu.nib just in case something goes wrong and you need to restore it.\n\n*Copy your edited MainMenu.nib to Base.lproj, overwriting the existing one.\n\n*Open Safari to make sure that it still opens (if it doesn't, restore your original MainMenu.nib file). \n\n*(Optional) If everything works, you may delete the backup MainMenu.nib if you so choose.\n\n\nBy removing the \"New Private Window\" menu item from the menu bar, they will not be able to enter private browsing. Additionally, keyboard shortcuts are tied to menu items, so that's disabled too.\n\n * ~ means your user home directory. Library is a hidden folder that isn't visible when you navigate to the home directory. You can get to this folder in the Finder by going to the \"Go\" menu and choosing \"Connect to Folder…\", then typing in ~/Library. You will then see the folders you need to copy files to.\nInstructions copied from this MacRumors forum thread, updated for Safari 9 in this post.\n\nA: Click on Safari. Click on Preferences.

And yes, i know how to get it into DFU, but the problem is that my power button doesn't work, so my question is, is there a way to get in to DFU mode through the computer?\n\nA: iClarified has provided this post that might be of use to you. It explains how to put your iPhone in DFU mode without using the power or home button.\nWhatever you mean to do, just be sure to read the post completely before doing so, as without a power button you won't be able to shutdown your iPhone to reboot it again. Unless you let it go completely flat - this would take a while.\n\nA: Try using TinyUmbrella from this link blog.firmwareumbrella.com\n\nA: Please do as the followings: \nOpen iTunes and connect the iPhone to your Mac. ... \nPress and hold the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button at the same time. ... \nAfter exactly 10 seconds release the Sleep/Wake button.

Or is there an alternative way to do it with Hazel?\n\nA: This AppleScript should do what you want:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/15180576#15180576\nYou would need to have Word running, however, for this to work. It's not my code but I just tried it out as a service in Automator with 10.9 and Office 2011 and it works both with a single and multiple Word docs.\nI suppose using the actual Word app is the only way to ensure correct layout but using a command-line Word-to-PDF converter could be done, too.\n", "Q: How to import certificates in Cisco AnyConnect iPhone app? In order to connect to a private network the connection should have IKE RSA - IPSEC. The default VPN connection settings that is in the settings of iPhone does not have this. The Cisco AnyConnect app have this option but the digital certificates that are visible in the default VPN are not visible in the AnyConnect app. Also the certificate import in the AnyConnect app asks for a URL instead of opening the file browser. \nHow to install a certificate so that it is detected by the AnyConnect app\nEdit: After a lot of digging I found out that the certificates detected by Cisco AnyConnect should be in SSL template and not in other template. So, how do I convert a p12 certificate that I have into a SSL templated certificate.\n\nA: The easiest way to would be to email the certificates to your iphone and install from there.\n1.

I installed it by using the link from the Apple website. However when I run xquartz from terminal I get:\n:~$ xquartz\n/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11: line 10: /usr/local/bin/bash: No such file or directory\n/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11: line 10: exec: /usr/local/bin/bash: cannot execute: No such file or directory\n\nThis is preventing me from launching xquartz/x11 applications that I downloaded through macports.  How can I resolve this so that xquartz runs properly?\n\nA: /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 is just a shell script that executes whatever is defined as $SHELL in your environment:\ncase $(basename \"${SHELL}\") in\n    bash)          exec -l \"${SHELL}\" --login -c 'exec \"${@}\"' - \"${@}\" ;;\n\n(etc).\nIn your case, it look as though $SHELL is set to /usr/local/bin/bash, which doesn't exist. What's interesting, though, is that since you have a prompt at which you have typed xquartz, you clearly are running a shell of some description. However, it doesn't correspond to the value of $SHELL.\nTwo suggestions for how this might happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*$SHELL will normally reflect the login shell for your user. You can set that in System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> right click on your username and choose \"Advanced Options\". If you set this to an invalid value, you won't normally be able to open a terminal... unless you go into the Terminal.app preferences and set the \"Shells open with:\" option to something which does exist. You'll then get a working terminal with a non-existent $SHELL.\n\n*Alternatively, it might be something in your shell startup scripts (.bashrc, .profile, etc) which export a misleading value of $SHELL to the environment. If you have customized any of these, take a look and make sure you're not setting things up incorrectly.\n\n", "Q: What is the font the battery percentage uses?

Once from Verizon to your computer running Apple Mail and then again from your computer to google.  Depending on how good the Verizon web mail/mail server is forwarding should be easy to set up.\nWhat you want to do is cut out your computer all together.\n\nIf you want to really set up forwarding from your computer i.e. from Apple Mail you would set up a rule in the following way:\nWhile in Mail: \nPress ⌘+, to bring up the preferences window\nSelect the Rules tab\n\nClick \"Add Rule\"\n\nPut in your \"Description\"\nSelect \"Every message\"\n\nUnder \"Perform the following actions\" \nSelect \"Redirect Message\" to put in your gmail account.\nPlease note that these instructions are for Mail 5.3 but should work with newer versions.\n\nA: Alternatively you can go in to Gmail and have it check your Verizon account like a desktop mail client. It will check your mail and remove it from the server and probably be a much easier set up than forwarding.\n\nA: Apple mail.app is a client so you could set up a rule to forward mail, but that rule doesn't run when the Mac is offline. \nMuch better would be to log in to the web interface and forward the mail directly from Verizon's mail server directly to google. \nIf you are ok with your Mac doing the forwarding, the built in help has instructions on setting up your first mail rule. \n\nA: Go to iCloud. Sign in with your apple info then click on the  'mail' symbol.  You will see your Apple mail.  On the far left, at the bottom, click on the gear symbol then preferences.  An option to forward all your Apple mail to  your new mail address is there, click on that.  Done.\nThis worked for me just yesterday with Mac Mail and GMail.  It forwards it as it comes in.

I also have a Mac server (192.168.1.10) running on the LAN. I want that server to be accessed only on the private wireless network.\nI want the hostname of the Mac server to resolve to 192.168.1.10 on the private wireless network instead of resolving to my external IP address. This means that DHCP clients on the private network need to have 192.168.1.10 as the primary DNS server and 8.8.8.8 as the secondary DNS server. The clients on the guest network on the other hand need different DNS servers (eg. 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).\nHow can I configure these settings separately for the private and guest network on the AirPort Extreme and Express?\n\nA: What you are suggesting will provide name resolution to the 192.168.1 subnet but has nothing to do with restricting access. \nThe correct way to do what you want is to firewall the device, or have no routing between your subnets. \nIf you do want to set up just the DNS settings then all you have to do is propagate them via DHCP. This means having two separate DHCP scopes, one with the google DNS servers, and one with your internal DNS server.\n\nA: What you could do is set-up your airports extrem/express to use just the Google's DNS.\nAnd for your local peripheral you modify the network settings, you can still keep DHCP but you override the DNS settings and put first your Mac Server and second the Google DNS. If you are a home user with a few devices, that should not be too much manual work.\n\nA: If you are unable to configure seperate settings for the DHCP server to hand out differnt DNS info to the different networks (which you cannot do with Apple's standard Airport Utility), I THINK that telling the Airport that the DNS servers are 192.168.1.10 and 8.8.8.8 (or your ISP's DNS server) will mostly have the effect that you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your local devices will use 192.168.1.10 since that will respond quickest. \n\n*Devices on the \"guest\" network may try to connect to 192.168.1.10 but since it won't respond, they will go to 8.8.8.8 for their information. \nThis type of setup is not ideal, since it is possible that your local devices won't be able to talk to other local devices if they somehow are using the 8.8.8.8 server which doesn't know about names on your private network - but that should be a rare event since the local DNS server should be preferred by local clients as it generally would be faster. The \"guest\" devices might experience some lag if they are continually waiting for a non-responsive connection to 192.168.1.10 before trying 8.8.8.8, but I think most devices will locally cache results for things that they have recently looked up and they may preferrentially use 8.8.8.8 once it is found to be faster than the unreachable 192.168.1.10.\nThis response bascially says the same thing: https://discussions.apple.com/message/24330741#message24330741\n", "Q: Export Outlook Emails (Mac) to Gmail I'm looking to export emails from Outlook and Entourage from Macs, and import them into Gmail (Google Apps).\nAny suggestions?

Then, I could upload to Gmail from there (risk loosing email quality, attachments, etc.)\n\nA: It depends on the setup you already have, but I think this should work.\n\n\n*\n\n*In your mail client (Entourage/ Outlook) setup the IMAP access to your Gmail account.\n\n*Setup the folders for sent and trash.\n\n*Move all mails from your other inboxes to your Gmail inbox:\nSelect all folders by clicking the top one under the account to be moved, and then Shift-click the bottom one.

Running a jailbreak on more current OS and hardware is easier, but still something quite technical. Going that far back is less likely to succeed if reading the how-to isn't giving you a clear picture how to start to jailbreak your device in question. \nI would do the easy and get her a wiped device on the OS that iTunes will support rather than needing to keep jail breaking it if the user chooses to update things. \n", "Q: Deleting Message cache Trying to delete all SMS and iMessage cache.  Other forums and research indicates a SYNC will do this.  Have tried, but old messages keep showing up in Spotlight search.  I want them deleted for good.  How?\n\nA: Obviously, it’s a cache bug (or more like feature). If you find that it’s a little annoying, Apple does provide a way to remove this.\nHere’s how to delete recent contacts from messages app (and other apps in iOS):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Messages app and tap on the New Message icon\n\n*In the recipient field, tap the name of the recently-deleted contact (or a part of the number)\n\n*When the contact shows up in the list, you should see a blue ‘i’ icon right next to the contact you just deleted\n\n*Tap on the ‘i’ icon. Next, tap on Remove from Recents\n\n*That’s about it. The contact will no longer show up.\n\n\nIt’s really that simple. This will remove the contact from the cache (of recent contacts) and it will make sure that the deleted contact doesn’t show up anywhere in iOS.\nThe problem doesn’t appear for contacts that you have not communicated with (via Email, Message or FaceTime). It’s mostly for contacts that you have communicated with via these services. The Recent Contacts list holds a cache of contact data (contacts that you have recently talked/messaged to) and it’s not available to modify.\n", "Q: Change default alert sound from terminal in Mac OSX The version of Mac OS X being used is 10.8.5.\nWhen I click the back button on an empty terminal windows if give a alert sound which is the 'Funk' sound in the System Preferences -> Sound -> Sound Effects\nI tried going to the Terminal Preferences -> Settings -> Advanced where there is a checkbox for turning the Audible/Visual Bell but not change the audible bell.\nCan this sound be changed to anything else in the Sound Effects list like Submarine, Tink etc.\n\nA: It looks like for macOS Sierra you simply need to change the Alert Sound under the Sound System Preferences (System Preferences > Sound > Sound Effects).\n\nA: In Sierra:\ndefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.sound.beep.sound /System/Library/Sounds/Submarine.aiff\n\n\nA: I don't know how to make Terminal use a different alert sound, but if others search for how to change the OS X-wide alert sound from a script, change the com.apple.sound.beep.sound key in the com.apple.systemsound domain:\ndefaults write com.apple.systemsound com.apple.sound.beep.sound /System/Library/Sounds/Frog.aiff\n\n", "Q: Numbers no longer opens .xls spreadsheet I have very recently converted to a MacBook Air from a PC and have a 1.3mb .xls file which 1 week ago Numbers happily opened, edited and saved in its own format. \nToday, when I opened it it was corrupted.

Typo!  furious backspacing Retype correctly!\" \nI have one beef though.  It seems that the typos I make are nonstandard enough that about 50% of the time, Auto-Correct chooses the wrong word.  This irritates me even more than making a typo in the first place.  It seems to happen often with double letter endings where I miss one, but that's certainly not the only case.\nExample:  When typing the word 'will' I often type 'wil', I have no idea why.  Auto-Correct zaps this to 'ail'.  So then, instead of backspace, type another L, space, keep going, I have to delete the entire wrong word.\nThe reason I am asking here is that I don't want to add misspelled words to the dictionary, I want to train the behavior of the Auto-Correct engine itself.  \nIs this possible?  I can't imagine that there's no capability for learning in that algorithm.  I dream of a time when I can just mash away at the keyboard, and the computer just knows what I mean and records my rhoughts (There's another one:  it gets instantly set to 'roughest' instead of 'thoughts') accordingly.\n\nA: You can use the text replacement feature OS X has. To get to it, open System Preferences and choose the Keyboard settings. Head over to the Text section and add as many typo corrections as you please. For your particular examples, you would click the + and put \"wil\" in replace and \"will\" in with; \"rhoughts\" and \"thoughts\".\n\nA: Just a blind guess here: Have you tried showing the spelling window, e.g. by pressing cmd + :\nThat window offers ways to accept spellings and maybe also to correct its choices.

Typing is easy on macbook since the keyboard is silicon. That's not the case with apple wireless keyboard which is connected to the mac-mini, keys are slippery. Speed typing is not easy like on macbook. \nMy Question is,\nAre there keyboards with silicon keys for apple computers ? Where can I buy them ? \nOr Can I replace keys on Wireless Keyboard with keys on macbook keyboard ?\n\nA: You can purchase a Moshi ClearGuard keyboard protector directly from Apple and use it on your wireless keyboard. I have one in use at home in the kitchen/family room for our AppleTV 3rd gen. Comes in handy when I'm cooking and want to use the keyboard as a remote without having to wash my hands!\nBTW/ Silicon is an element (#14 on the Periodic table.)

I've got dnsmasq working fine. I've created a .plist file in /Library/LaunchDaemons with the following contents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>uk.org.thekelleys.dnsmasq</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n            <string>/usr/local/sbin/dnsmasq</string>\n            <string>--keep-in-foreground</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis runs perfectly if I do:\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/uk.org.thekelleys.dnsmasq.plist\n\nHowever, it does not start at boot.\nPermissions are: -rw-r-xr-x\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: Thanks to LCC for pointing out LaunchControl. It indicated the ownership of /Library/LaunchDaemons was incorrect.\nThe solution to this problem was to be sure /Library/LaunchDaemons had ownership root:admin, and permissions for the directory were rwxr-xr-x\n", "Q: Secure access to data while retaining convenience and performance I am looking for a convenient solution to the following problem:\nI have some large data (tens of GB) that resides on the hard drive of a Mac.  Access to the data needs to be restricted so even users with administrative privileges can't access it without a password.  At the same time, those people who do have access should have convenient and fast access: ideally, after unlocking them, the restricted files should be visible and accessible in the same way as any other file on the system.  It must be possible to run programs that process the data and accessing the files should not be much slower than usual file access.  Only read access is needed, not write access.\nWhat sorts of convenient solutions are possible on a Mac (OS X 10.9)?\nIs it for example possible (or advisable) to put everything in an encrypted DMG disk image?  It could be mounted after entering a password and used as a normal volume afterwards, but I'm not sure if other users who are logged in at the same time will be able to access it.  I am not deeply familiar with Mac specific technologies.  I understand that usually there is a tradeoff between security and convenience.\n\nA: An encrypted disk image is useful to prevent anyone getting access to it unless you authorize it (by entering the password). Once you've authorized access to it, it's just another volume (disk) that's visible to the Mac and its users, just like any other file on your boot volume.\nIf you talk about other users, I assume you mean giving them access through network file sharing?\nNow, you might have noticed that if someone connects to your Mac using file sharing, he has to enter your Mac's user name and password, right? Unless you allow Guest access, in which case anyone can connect as Guest. But Guests can only access certain shared (public) folders.\nNow, you might also have noticed that you can create new users on your Mac, using the System Preferences, Users & Groups. If you create a new local user, he gets his own private folder area under /Users/. And now, if someone logs into your Mac, he can use either that new user name or yours. Eitehr will only give him access to that specific user's folders.\nWith that knowledge, you can now create a special user that only certain people may have access to. Tell them that user's name and password. Copy the to-be-protected files into that user's Documents folder. You can then also use Finder's \"Get Info\" on those files/folders to choose who has access to them, i.e. that the owner (that specific new user) can read, but not write. That way, no one can mess with the files, they're read-only. Make sure you apply these ownerships to all enclosed folders, using the gear icon in the Get Info window. Then test this and make sure that a remotely logged-in user can indeed only read but not modify those files.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: How do I troubleshoot personal hotspot mode failing to issue IP addresses?

They enabled hotspot for my account, but it still would not help. They gave me a phone number to call, I called tech support, and was told:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off LTE. Settings > Cellular > Enable LTE (Off)\n\n*Turn off/on Personal Hotspot.\n\n\nNow it works! It only works on 4G.\nI don't know if having the hotspot feature ($5/m) enabled on your account is relevant or not. I thought all data was combined, and since it is an unlocked phone, how could they know?\n\nA: i had the same problem earlier on and it was soo frustrating! \nAnyway i got it fixed (posting here using my revived laptop!) and the following was what worked for me:\nStart > Control Panel > Windows Firewall > Allow a program or feature > remove Bonjour > reboot computer and watch the magic unfold.\nP.S This was a solution posted by kind humans in another forum but it took me long to find it..Just thought i could share it on this forum as well to hopefully make the search easier for others.\ncheers, hope this would solve your problem too! :)\n\nA: This one drove me nuts but I believe this will work for most of you:\nBasically the APN settings for the Hotspot were missing.\nIf you can browse the internet on your phone and you can activate your Hotspot but you get the yellow exclamation mark on the computer's wifi or the 'Network cable unplugged\" with USB tethering, try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings -> Mobile Data -> Mobile Data Network\n\n*Check the APN/Username/Password settings under \"Mobile Data\" (most\nof the time username and password - if used - are identical, if not search APN settings on your provider's homepage)\n\n*Enter the same settings under \"Personal Hotspot\" further down on the same settings page\n\n*Return to Settings Menu\n\n*Switch Mobile Hotspot off and on\n\n*Connect to your Hotspot -> Internet on your computer should be working now\n\n\nThe problem appeared for me while roaming/after changing sims, basically every time the network settings get reconfigured and the APN settings automatically change for the roaming network/new network. \nHope it works for you too!\n\nA: I am going to take some time to do a summary of networking and troubleshooting to try to help you out.\nWhen your phone is running a Personal Hotspot it starts up a couple services on the phone's OS one being a DHCP service. DHCP might seem familiar two you because it is what is the part of every network that gives out the IP address.\nA network has two sides to it, internal and external. In our modern day there are external IPs that look like this 2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334 and internal IPs that look like this: 127.0.0.1 or maybe you have seen 192.168.1.1\nIf you see a IP address on your computer(s) with 169.... this usually means that the DHCP service is not reachable. This could have several reasons and in this case I am going to assume that your Windows computer does not have the correct driver to speak with the iPhone's DHCP service. If you connect your iPhone via USB the driver is different than Bluetooth or WiFi.\nWe should be able to assume that the iPhone's network is fine if you can surf the web on your iPhone. Now getting that network over to your Windows computer is a matter of connecting the iPhone via USB (or WiFi or Bluetooth) and making sure that the driver is installed correctly. This should be the case as long as you have the latest version of iTunes installed on the computer and the iPhone shows up in iTunes as an available device.\nThe error message you get of \"Connection in limited\" is to my understanding the Windows version of \"self-assigned IP address\" which results from the computer not understanding the DHCP and/or DNS settings from the device it is getting network activity from.\nPlease verify all of these things and if you notice anything else out of the ordinary and I'll update my guide to help more.\n\nA: I had this same issue. Turns out that when traveling to another country and using a SIM card, I was required to enable a profile on my iPhone. This profile set the APN, which in turn was blocking me from tethering. To check on your iPhone, this go to:\nSettings app → Cellular → Cellular Data Options → Cellular Data Network\nIn my case, the APN was pointed at the network in the country I had used the SIM card in. Even with this APN I was still able to use my phone on my current network with little troubles, but I was not able to tether.\nIf you see that the APN settings are wrong, and resetting them does not work (my profile prevented them from being reset), go to:\nSettings app → General → Profile (if this does not exist, then you don't have any profiles installed). Delete the profile you do not need and this may solve your problem.\n\nA: I tried everything above, but did not fix the problem, I made the pc \"discoverable\" on my private network, then the dropped gateway problem went away. Do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings.\nThe Settings window appears.\n\n\n*Click Network & Internet.\nYour network and Internet related settings are shown.\n\n\n*In the panel on the left, click either Wi-Fi (if you’re connected to a wireless network) or Ethernet (if you’re connected to a network using a network cable).\nA window with settings for your network appears.\n\n\n*Find the Related setting section on the right, then click Change Advanced Sharing Settings.\nThe Advanced Sharing Settings window appears. \n\n\n*Expand the network profile currently assigned to your network connection.\nIt is marked with the words “current profile” on the right side of its name.\n\n\n*In the Network discover section, select “Turn on network discovery”. Also, check the box that says “Turn on automatic setup of network connected devices.”\nTurning on network discovery.\n\n\n*Click Save changes.\n\n*Close the Settings window\n\nA: Bug in iOS: DHCP on iPhone stops working at some point.\nI am always able to connect to iPhone's hotspot, but none of the clients receive an IP address.\nIf I configure static IP configuration on any of the clients, it is able to access the Internet. That means the DHCP server on my iPhone 7 Plus isn't running. The rest of the functionality: Wi-Fi hotspot and USB LAN adapter function properly and show as connected.\nAfter powering-off and restarting my iPhone7 Plus, all clients are automatically configured using DHCP. This means that the DHCP server initially works, but stops after a few hours, and is never restarted.\nTested clients: MacBook Pro 2018, Windows 10 1909, iPhone 4s, Samsung A5.\nPlease contact Apple support and tell them you also experience the symptoms from case 100955127642.\n", "Q: Some contacts are missing in iOS Contacts How can I get back (some) missing contacts?

Through dumb luck, I've ended up with 3 OpenCL-capable graphics card in my Mac.  I even ran the little \"list all your OpenCL devices\" sample program from Apple, and it lists all of them.\nDo programs that use OpenCL automatically use all OpenCL devices that are available to the system, or is it like CPUs (prior to GCD) where programs needed to be explicitly written to use multiple devices?\n\nA: I've had a lot of trouble running OpenCL drivers both on Mountain Lion and Maverics. \nThe answer to your question is that programs need to be explicitly written to use multiple devices.\nHowever how the cards are used depends on what you are using them for.

Mac OSX Maverick 10.9 seems to pick one screen and it does not show the stretched window on the other screen anymore.\nThis is a problem because I like to use one particular program (VMWareFusion) to do my software development in full screen mode. No longer can I see my guest operating system in both screens anymore when I full screen it because of this problem... at least that is my hypothesis.\n\nA: I haven't tested it myself, but according to John Siracusa's review at ars, if you disable the \"Displays have separate Spaces\" checkbox in the Mission Control preference pane, the old behavior (including ability to split a window between displays) returns.\n\nA: I had this same issue and I just couldn't figure out what to do.

For example, if the page URL is https but it loads a JavaScript file via http, no lock icon. \nThe only workaround I've found so far is to run the openssl command in Terminal, like this:\necho ^d | openssl s_client -connect host.example.com:443\n\nThis will show you the certificate chain back to whatever root authority is used to sign, if any. \"verify error\" will show things like \"self signed certificate\".\n\nA: If you request a single asset, such as an image on the site, over HTTPS then Safari will show you the padlock.  \nFor example, choose an image on the page you are looking at, Ctrl-click/Right-click the image, choose to view that image in a new Tab.

I am trying to recover a nearly-2TB backup of a Mac, whose sparsebundle file was located on a NAS and suffered some corruption. I have followed the steps here, and the sparsebundle is now accessible by both Time Machine and Migration Assistant. However, they only show me one choice for recovering the backup (the most recent one).\nMounting the sparsebundle in Finder shows me backups from 4 dates, which is correct, and I am interested in any of the earlier 3. Additionally, here is the data from the file com.apple.TimeMachine.SnapshotHistory.plist, which also shows the 4 backups:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Snapshots</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotCompletionDate</key>\n            <date>2013-11-21T17:37:20Z</date>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotName</key>\n            <string>2013-11-21-123720</string>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotTotalBytesCopied</key>\n            <integer>2011005404937</integer>\n        </dict>\n        <dict>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotCompletionDate</key>\n            <date>2013-11-22T08:04:32Z</date>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotName</key>\n            <string>2013-11-22-030432</string>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotTotalBytesCopied</key>\n            <integer>7208602218</integer>\n        </dict>\n        <dict>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotCompletionDate</key>\n            <date>2013-11-22T23:58:38Z</date>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotName</key>\n            <string>2013-11-22-185838</string>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotTotalBytesCopied</key>\n            <integer>111986052</integer>\n        </dict>\n        <dict>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotCompletionDate</key>\n            <date>2013-12-04T21:16:16Z</date>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotName</key>\n            <string>2013-12-04-161616</string>\n            <key>com.apple.backupd.SnapshotTotalBytesCopied</key>\n            <integer>53164333190</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nHow do I go about repairing the sparsebundle so I can have Time Machine restore one of the earlier backups? My last resort would be copying everything over by hand, but this would be messy, as well as incredibly time-consuming due to the large amount of data. I have spent many hours on this and have had headache after headache, any help is extremely appreciated!\n\nA: Not completely sure if it will works since I don't know when the snapshot was taken (before or after an update).  You can go into your system preferences, spotlight, privacy tab, add your hard drive, reboot, remove the hard drive from spotlight and let the spotlight re-index (this can take a while).  Try going into time machine again.  \nUpdates have messed up Time Machine when doing a clean install and upgrade for quite a few people and this was the fix.\n\nA: If all else fails I have (over the last few days) been recovering files on my corrupted backup drive with Photorec. Photorec is part of TestDisk, and despite the name knows how to recover many more file types than just photos, including music and Office documents. It seems that the sparesbundle bands still leave most files contiguous on the disk, so they can be found and recovered.\nIt needs to run locally to the HDD, so in my case that involved ssh login to the NAS (WD Mybook Live) and installing TestDisk there with apt. \nI set it to save all the recovered files to an NFS-shared folder on my Mac\nThe commands below are from memory, \nssh root@backup.local\napt-get update\napt-get install testdisk\nmount 192.168.0.11/Users/andypugh/share /shares/stuff\nYou will definitely want to be selective about what file types you tell photorec to look for. It finds many thousands of false-positive .gz files unless told not to, for example.\n", "Q: Disk space disappearing The kernel_task process is at 567MB of RAM, and my hard disk space keeps disappearing. I just synced an iPhone 4S with iTunes like ~2 days ago, and now every couple hours I get the message that the startup disk is low on space. I've tried using Grand Perspective to no avail, as well as Disk Doctor.\n\nWhat might be consuming my space or causing these results?\n\nA: My guess is you have a stuck process that is impairing the ability of the OS to tell you what amount of space is actually used from Applications, audio-movies-photo rather than categorizing everything as \"other\". \n\n\n*\n\n*Make a back up of the Mac in case it's corruption or a serious problem. \n\n*Power off the Mac. \n\n*Boot to safe mode - hold the shift key as soon as you hear the startup chime and release it 20 seconds after the grey screen is drawn. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564\nThat should free up a stuck process and also repair any disk corruption at is easily fixable. Please let us know if you continue to get bad information from the space allocation image. Surely Applications take up more than zero K. \n\nA: You can search for large files, see this earlier question (or using Spotlight).\nThe installer for 10.9.1 will take up 230 Mb, add another 230 Mb for the installed files, so that's the 0.5 Gb you reported losing. \n\nA: That behavior is \"normal\". Part of your disk space is used for \"virtual memory\", and that space is at least as much as you have RAM in your Mac. When you reboot, this virtual memory file gets cut again to the minimum. So, if you reboot, you should have more space again. If that's the case, it kind of proves my point.\nOther programs that need more space than what your RAM offers, will also extend this VM file, and also cause a lot of disk access, making your Mac much slower (unless you have a SSD as your main disk).\nTo monitor the VM usage, try looking at your memory with the \"Activity Monitor\" app.\nBasically, you need more free disk space. 5 GB is just not enough for many apps nowadays.\n", "Q: Can't install or buy apps from App Store on iPad mini iOS 7 I’m trying to buy apps or music from App Store and iTunes but isn't working.

I have a friend that wants to buy a Mac Book Pro and he has some windows applications that he needs to run. He doesn't want to buy the applications again.\nCan he run the Windows applications on his MacBook Pro? What ways to accomplish this are available?\n\nA: You can install Windows Applications on your Mac in 3 ways.\n\n*\n\n*Use Bootcamp to install Windows on your Mac. Requires a legal copy of Windows. Also the fastest, but you can't run Mac Applications at the same time\n\n*Install a Virtual Machine, such as Parallels or VirtualBox. Performance will suffer.\n\n*Use Wine to run Windows Applications. Performance will suffer\n\nThe Answer to your Question:\nYes, VM's are a good way to run Windows Applications, however they are not foolproof. Mac's, while certainly more optimized, are not more powerful than a PC. These are because they are PC's; just ones designed by apple. You would be running an entire PC in a PC, which means it will greatly affect performance. However, if it's something low performance, a VM might just work! Ask your friend to attempt to find (hopefully free) alternatives to whatever software he has licensed for Mac OS X\n\nA: You have three choices. They all come with pros and cons\nRun a Virtual Machine\nYou have VMWare Fusion and Parallels Desktop in the commercial space to chose from when it comes to virtualization software. And if you're comfortable tweaking and fiddling you can use VirtualBox for free.\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*Near native speeds for your applications\n\n*Your OS X-based data can be accessed from your Windows programs\n\n*Can pick between running them in a full Windows desktop-in-a-Window or in integrated mode where the Window apps appear as windowed apps right in your OS X desktop\n\n*Decent support in the commercial offerings at least for graphics acceleration so you can run some graphics intensive programs\n\n*You get a bunch of neat things with virtual machines including the ability to pause applications mid-run and snapshot the state of your virtual machine \n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to buy a copy of the Windows operating system\n\n*The Windows OS installation will take up a lot of space on your hard drive, plus the Windows application space\n\n*If your Mac is older, doesn't have much RAM, the VM approach can drag down your system a bit but most, if not all, new Macs can handle VM hosting duties without much of any issue\n\n\nRun Wine\nWine is a translation layer for Windows applications. It's a bit like a virtual machine but doesn't require the Windows OS. It sits between the Windows application and OS X and makes the application think it's running on Windows by translating all the Windows calls its making to OS X calls.\nThere are two choices of know of here. The free WineBottler and the paid-for CrossOver Mac from CodeWeavers.\nSome commercial software is delivered for OS X this way -- I know The Sims 3 game that my wife likes to play on her MacBook Pro is actually the Windows version of the game running under the Wine emulator.\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't need to buy a copy of Windows\n\n*Your OS X-based data can be accessed from your Window programs\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Application support under Wine can be hit-and-miss. Some apps work well, some don't. Check at http://appdb.winehq.org/ to see if your applications are on the list of tested, supported applications if you're going to try WineBottler. CodeWeavers keeps their own list.\n\n*Because the Windows applications think they're running on Windows, and not everything Windows does translates perfectly to OS X, some applications can behave erratically.\n\n\nRun Windows Native with BootCamp\nWindows can actually be installed your Apple hardware directly and usually runs just fine. Apple even provides a utility called BootCamp that lets you keep a Windows and OS X installation available to your Mac and pick which OS to boot in to when you start up your machine.\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*That's the fastest you can get for Windows apps on Apple hardware. It's the OS running on bare metal. If you need every last little bit of performance for your applications, this will be your best bet.\n\n*Your Windows partition stays separate from your OS X partition so changes to one rarely impact the other\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to buy a copy of the Windows operating system\n\n*Moving data between the Windows side to the OS X side is hard and in some cases impossible, for the most part the OS'es and their programs are completely silo'ed\n\n\nA: Nearly any Windows app can be made to run on Mac hardware, running OS X, even graphically intensive games, albeit with a loss in performance (to some degree or other), just by wrapping the application in a Wineskin... Now I had heard about this over a couple of years, but, after my experience of using Wine on Linux in the early 2000's, I was always put off my what I imagined would be a right pain to configure, terrible performance and just a general nightmare. How wrong I turned out to be. About two months ago I ended up having to fix a game app to run OS X, found some instructions, followed them and since then I have been wineskin-ing loads of Windows only apps (Multimeter logging software, Comms software, etc).\n\nDownload Wineskin Winery, and follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update the wrapper\n\n*Install a wineskin engine\n\n*Create a wrapper\n\n*Configure your wrapper\n\n*Install and run your software\n\n*How to Get Back to the Wrapper Configuration Page\n\n\nThese steps were taken from How to Run Your Favorite Windows Programs on OS X with Wineskin. There is an alternative method, which I employ, which comes from the youtube video that I mention below, How To Fix Grand Theft Auto SanAndreas Not Starting *Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Wineskin winery app and update the wrapper - click on the Update button.\n\n*Install a wineskin engine - click the + beneath the list area of the engines, choose the latest one and click Download and Install\n\n*Create a new wrapper - name it in the subsequent dialog, \"Please choose a name for this wrapper\", click OK.\n\n*The subsequent dialogs (Do you want to install Mono, .NET, etc.) you can click Cancel, if you know that you don't need them, otherwise there is no hard in clicking Install\n\n*On the OSX dialog, \"Do you want the app to accept incoming Network connections\" - click Deny if your app needs no network access, else click Allow.\n\n\n\n*When it has finally finished creating the Wrapper (it can take a while), click on View wrapper in Finder \n\n\n*Right click and select Show Package Contents \n\n*Open the alias drive_c. This should reveal three directories (Users, Program Files and windows)\n\n*Now on the PC/Windows machine, where your Windows application resides, open up the C:\\Program Files\\ directory and copy the directory that contains your installed app to the mac (via network, USB drive or what have you). So if the path is \nC:\\Program Files\\RandomCorp\\NiceApp\\NiceApp.exe\nthen you want to copy the RandomCorp directory.\n\n\n*Once you have copied the RandomCorp directory to your Mac, drag it to the Program Files directory in the drive_c in the Wineskin wrapper. You can now close the window to the package contents.\n\n*Open the wrapper (double click the icon). As it is not yet configured, a double opens up. In the resulting Wineskin dialog, click Advanced, click Browse, navigate to the RandomCorp\\NiceApp directory, locate the NiceApp.exe and click Choose.\n\n*Click Test Run to test it. \n\n*The application should run. \n\n*You can now close it. \n\n*Test Run logs - if you had no problems click Cancel else click View to see what went wrong. \n\n*You can now close the Advanced dialog.\n\n*You can now run the app by doubling clicking the Wrapper icon.\n\n\nThere are a number of video tutorials out there, on youtube, of varying quality. I, myself, followed one called \"How To Fix Grand Theft Auto SanAndreas Not Starting *Mac\" (The mis-spelling of San Andreas is a direct quote). Admittedly it does not have the best audio, nor is the verbal explanation particularly clear, but the steps in the video itself are straight forward enough - it is the video that I followed and learnt with, when I had to resort to using Wineskin for the first time. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: Have you heard of software called Parallels Desktop?  http://parallels.com\nIt has some great features; not just not having to reboot your computer every time you switch from to Mac to Windows or vice versa but also being able to use so many programs with speed and efficiency, being able to access your document created in Windows from your Mac without any hassle and also sync Mac browsers such as Safari bookmarks with Windows browser bookmarks.   \n", "Q: iPhone 4S lock button My lock button doesn't work and a couple of days ago my screen stopped working as well. I can't slide my lock screen or anything now; do I send it to service?\n\nA: Reset your phone by holding down on the off button slide the red button to the right and your device should shut off wait for a few seconds take and hold down on your off button again until an Apple appears wait for a few more seconds and you should be able to work your phone. Good luck\n\nA: Yes - you'll want someone that services the device to have a look.

I was thinking, anybody having there hands on a new MacPro (the late 2013), would it be possible -in time- to swap the CPU from a new MacPro?\nIts the CPU soldered to the motherboard?\nLooking forward for your thoughts.\n\nA: While there is no teardown of the 2013 MacPro yet, digging into Intel's Ark DB might be useful. \nFor example the i7 processor used in the MacBook Pro Retina late 2013 is a 4750HQ registered as using the BGA \"socket\" (Ball grid array) which is synonym of soldered to the mainboard. \nFor the MacPro Apple tells us there is either a 3.7Ghz w/ 4cores or a 3.5GHz w/ 6cores or a 3.0GHz w/ 8-cores or a 2.7GHz w/ 12-cores. All the processors that have these specs in ark are listed to only using the FCLGA2011 socket (see here the Xeon E5 v2 spec sheet). \nSo to me it's pretty sure that yes the cpu is not soldered to the mainboard and is therefore upgradable.  \n\nA: It certainly will be upgradeable, but to what, exactly? Only other processors of the same architecture (in this case, Ivy Bridge-EP - you won't be able to upgrade it to, say, Haswell, and it will be unlikely that there is a change in Mac Pro architecture such that a newer chipset will be used, provide significant advantage over what you're using now, and still be compatible with the current model).\nMore details and links, from a couple of paragraphs stolen from my own blog post written in January:\n\nIn spite of many published assumptions to the contrary, the CPU is removable and upgradeable (details here, here, here, and here). However, the one socket is Ivy Bridge-EP, so you'd only be able to move up to a higher number of relatively equivalent cores later, not to an entirely new chipset like Haswell. In the MacRumors piece, OWC successfully replaced the E5-1650 V2 (6 cores, 3.5-3.9 GHz, 12 MB cache) with the E5-2667 V2 (8 cores, 3.3-4.0 GHz, 25 MB cache). Currently this may not seem like a fantastic deal, as the 2667 has an MSRP just over $2,000 – though the Apple upgrade from 6 to 8 cores (likely the E5-1680 V2, with the same cores and cache, but lower clock speed of 3.0-3.9 GHz) is $1,500, and you don't get to keep, sell or re-purpose the 6-core chip. Presumably you would only do this anyway when Ivy Bridge prices fall much further and/or when your warranty is up.\n  \n  Personally, I wouldn't risk it – just buy the processors you need now. It's not like CPU clock speeds are on the verge of smashing the 4.0 GHz barrier anyway, or there are significant core count increases coming soon, and I think the process of swapping out this specific CPU in this specific machine a year or two down the road is going to be a lot more complex than you might expect. That all said, I don't remember ever wanting or needing to replace the CPUs in a workstation – usually you can't jump chipsets, and by the time you can justify that change, there are probably plenty of other things you could upgrade as well. In the Mac Pro space, this could be quite some time away.\n\n", "Q: Sharing screens/monitor between Asus Laptop and iMac I have the following equipment:\n\n\n*\n\n*An iMac 27\" (mid-2011 windows 8 BOOTCAMP with 2 thunderbolt port and 1 miniDisplayPort)\n\n*An ASUS ROG laptop (with 1x VGA port/Mini D-sub 15-pin for external monitor / Mini display-port / 1 x HDMI)\n\n*An External monitor with HDMI, VGA and DVI input.\nI want to use the display on my iMac as a 2nd screen from my asus laptop, leaving the iMac to use the external Monitor instead of it's own screen.  Essentially, I would like to use the iMac screen as an external monitor while still having the iMac running a full OS, not just being used an a monitor.  Is it possible for this iMac to either a) receive input to be used as an external monitor, and b) if so, can it still be used as a computer at this point?\n\nA: I'm afraid that's not possible...\nThe closest you can get to that is by using Target Display Mode as described here. The problem, though, is that TDM is only available when running OS X on the iMac. Furthermore, you won't be able to use the iMac even though it's technically running. \nJudging from this question here at Ask Different, TDM doesn't seem to support multiple displays while running anyway.\nI've looked at this before and did some research for this question, and I was unable to find anything beyond streaming the contents in an AirPlay-like fashion, which I doubt is usable in your case.\n\nA: You can try network based solutions like ScreenRecycler, Spacedesk or MaxiVista. \nTry this link: http://alternativeto.net/software/maxivista/\n", "Q: Go to the Running Safari And Press Enter Using AppleScript I'm very new to AppleScript and I'm trying to do this.

The font rendering in iBooks (version 1.0.1) on my Mac (Mavericks 10.9.1) is outright horrible. The text is jagged and rough looking. I've tried changing the font but that doesn't help, it still looks bad. Does anyone have a solution to this problem, or have I just gotten too used to the smooth look of iOS iBooks?\nEdit: This is on an early 2008 Mac Pro, on a 22\" screen with 1680x1050 resolution, and on a 24\" screen with 1920x1200 resolution. Font or font size does not matter. I've only seen the problem in iBooks, not in any other app. Notes and other UI text is fine, it's just the actual text I want to read that's jagged.\nAs a comparison, my mid 2011 27\" iMac shows the text beautifully.\n\n\nA: It seems that there is are others that report a problem with font rendering in the iBooks app when using epub files under OS X Mavericks (10.9.x). As in your experience, the problem seems isolated to Macs that don't have a Retina Display, such as your Mac Pro.\nThe solution is fortunately a simple one: Go to\nSystem Preferences > General\nand uncheck the box that says Use LCD font smoothing when available.\nThis should clear up the jagged text you've been experiencing in iBooks on your Mac Pro.\n(Note: You may need to quit and restart iBooks and/or restart your Mac for these changes to take effect.)\n\nA: I am leaning towards a issue with the monitor profile(s). The iMac has an installed display and Apple maximises their programs to run the best on their hardware. I am therefore assuming that if you put the iMac in target display mode and use that on the Mac Pro (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) you won't have an issue with how the font looks in iBooks. What might be necessary is to borrow a screen calibration module and first capture the date from the iMac in TDM and then calibrate one external display to match that quality. If that resolves the issue then you can calibrate the other monitor based off of the update profile for the pair you just had.\nThe other thought that comes to mind is the PPI ration from your monitors, if they are too variant from Apple's lowest PPI (which is supported for iBooks) then calibration might not be enough.\nI am taking your words as a note of caution as I am currently creating a rather intensive iBook but I am doing so on a 15\" MacBook Pro from 2011 and hope to somehow test the iBook on a retina display before it gets released.\nSorry if I gave some rather bad news but trying Target Display with the iMac might help show if it is a hardware issue with the Mac Pro's graphic card  or a software/driver issue with the monitors attached to the Mac Pro (personally I think it is a issue with the third party monitor resolution and color).\n\nA: Evidently this is a bug in iBooks that ONLY manifests on non-Retina Macs. That also means non-Retina native Mac displays. Retina displays shouldn't see this.\nI can't comment so this has to be an \"answer\"... If you turn off \"Use LCD font smoothing when available\" then other Apps that rely on it (like Tweetbot) will look like crap. If iBooks is the only App needing this workaround, then Apple needs bugreports. LOTS of bugreports.\nSo: if you notice that all your other Apps \"look bad\" or their fonts ligatures 'too thin' then remember to turn Smoothing back ON.\nIn my experience, a restart was not necessary. \nThis is not about monitors or profiles because I can see it on my MBP. Native monitor, native calibration, and every other App looks... fine. Except when I turn off LCD Font Smoothing.. then iBooks looks merely okay while every other App (Safari, Tweetbot-Mac) looks like crap.\n", "Q: How to file transfer between android and iPhone via bluetooth Why Bluetooth of apple devices doesn't work for transferring data or files with other devices and even with apple to apple devices?

How to fix it?\n\nA: Why not just install the latest version of Xcode?\nXcode 3.2 was originally released all the way back in 2009 and since it's a very technical product by nature, it's not really a surprise that it crashes on a OS that was released 5 years later.\nIf you really, really need v. 3.2, I'd suggest looking into virtualization (Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion are popular choices). You could then install Leopard (10.5) and Xcode 3.2 and compile via the virtual machine.\n\nA: Xcode 3 shouldn't install on Mavericks, and if it does it definitely isn't supported by Apple.\nTo avoid the login crash try entering your login credentials, and immediately after pressing return, hold down the shift key to prevent anything from loading. IF that doesn't stop the kernel panic, then you will need to wipe, reinstall, and resort from your Time Machine backup.\nThe best bet for using Xcode 3 is to dedicate an old machine to running an OS that supports Xcode 3. From my notes it looks like that would Snow Leopard (10.6). Another alternative is, if your Mavericks machine is old enough to run 10.6, install that on a partition or a dedicated hard drive. I stopped working for a company this year that was still using Xcode 3 as the official compiler for release builds.\n\nA: I agree with the other posts; installing down-level variants of Xcode on Mavericks is unfortunately a recipe for pain.\nBetter option than install a dedicated machine, why not run an OSX VM in Parallels / Fusion?  At that point, to be honest you would be better off running a Linux VM and compiling from there - is there any reason why you can't do this?\n\nA: I've solved this problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot to the recovery\n\n*Mount system disk\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Go to /System/Library/Extensions/\n\n*Remove every kext, containing \"CHUD\" in its name\n\n*Remove AppleProfileFamily.kext\n\n*Done.\n\n", "Q: Can the default permissions on /dev/disk* be changed? Is it possibile to change default permissions /dev/disk*? \nIn Linux this is done in the udev configuration files; which is the equivalent on OS X?\nI'd like to give group write permissions so members of the group operator will be able to perform write operations to external hard drives without using sudo (e.g. run virtual machines from external usb drives).\nI tried to sudo chmod g+w /dev/disk2* but it doesn't persist as when the first write attempt permissions revert to 640 instead of the changed permissions. \n\nA: As far as I can tell, Apple locks this stuff down pretty hard to the point where it's not reasonably possible. \nHowever, considering what you want to do with it, I'm certain that what you're actually wanting is to give write access to the external HDD which can be found in /Volumes/ (after you plug it in). Now, most external HDDs I've used (that are formatted properly*) will allow anyone to write to 'em unless an Admin chmod 'em to say otherwise. \n*NTFS-formatted drives are read-only through the Mac OS. As far as I know, there is no way around this without reformatting the drive. \n", "Q: Unable to create Mobile Account on AD Connected Mavericks Machine Whenever I try to login as an AD user to an OS X Mavericks Macbook Pro it says unable to create mobile account.

How can I fix it? The calendar in my iPhone does not allow me to input new events.  It was working fine, and I did nothing different to the Phone.  When I try to input a new event, it won't 'stick'.\nHere's what I know:  \n\n\n*\n\n*I can add an event directly into iCloud, and it will show up on iCal on my computer and in my iPhone. \n\n*I can add event on my computer in iCal and it will show up on my iPhone, but not in my iCloud calendar.\n\n*I try to add an event into the calendar on iPhone, and nothing shows up anywhere.\n\n\nOSX 10.7.5\niPhone 7.0.4\n\nA: You may be inadvertently saving the event to the wrong calendar. Often email accounts, such as Gmail automatically enable a calendar when being set up. If the event shows up only on your iPhone, and nowhere else, chances are your default calendar is set to something that you are not used to checking. \nWhen you create an event, scroll down to where you can see the menu item \"Calendar\". Tap that, and choose one of your iCloud calendars. If the event then shows up on iCloud, and your computer, you have chosen the correct calendar.\nIf this is case, you will probably want to change your default calendar by opening your Settings.app, scrolling down and selecting \"Mail, Contacts, and Calendar\". At the bottom of this screen is a section titled \"Calendars\". Change the \"Default Calendar\" to reflect the one that worked correctly.\n\nA: I had same problem.

Even if you activate things with Escape then the key, that’s just an alias for Meta.\nYou can see what command is bound to a key with C-h k, then you can bind that function to another key in your .emacs\nFor instance, if I wanted to move query-replace-regexp, which I have on M-%, I might add these lines:\n(global-set-key “\\M-%” nil) \n(global-set-key “\\C-%\" 'query-replace-regexp)\n\nYour other option would be to change what key to use as Meta, but that would probably be a lot more trouble.\n", "Q: How to send an email to everyone in the address book?

(rights related ?)\nThanks\n\nA: This is due to the behaviour of your shell that is running in there Terminal.app. It is probably the bash shell\nWhen you ask the shell to run a command if you provide an absolute path (that is beginning with / as your second one does) it will try to execute that program at that path. If you provide a relative path (i.e. one not starting with /) it will try to create an absolute path by prepending the directories that are in your PATH environment variable to what you typed. As your current directory or . is not on your PATH it cannot find  a file to execute. If the path begins with a . the it will repave that by the absolute path of your current directory and thus get a path that can be executed.\n\nA: *\n\n*~ = home folder nothing else.\n\n*./something will execute that something (be it script or binary)\nWriting the full path is the same as executing with ./\n\n*cd is change directory, so it will not execute\nThese are all standard unix/linux command line commands\nReferences:\nhttp://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php\nhttp://www.arachnoid.com/linux/shell_programming.html\n", "Q: Open Terminal to a Specific Directory On Windows I can Shift Right-click in a folder and I am presented with the option to Open a Command Window Here.

The wikipedia page on WLAN channels notes region limitations.\nFor example, in the US, in the 2.4 GHz spectrum you're only allowed to use channels 1-11, not 12, 13 and 14, while other regions may allow these.\nIn the 5 GHz spectrum, many countries only allow channels 34-165, or some subset of those (e.g. the US allows 36, 40, 44, 48-116, 132-165). Actually, you'll also note that not all channels in the ranges are listed (e.g. there's a big gap from 64-100, and a gap of 2 or 4 between most successive available channels) so its not necessarily obvious in the 5 GHz range if a channel is excluded in your region.\nAnyway, the thing to do is check what region your devices (Access Point & Laptop) are set to, and either adjust them to be the same, and/or set your AP to use a channel common to both regions (e.g. 1-11 in the 2.4 GHz range or 48-64 in the 5 GHz range).\n", "Q: Resetting password for Macbook I need to factory reset my Macbook but cannot recall the password.\nSo I used Cmd+R during startup and go to terminal and typed 'resetpassword'\naccording to this advice \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5309334?tstart=0\nNow 'Reset Password' application appears but there is nothing where I have to select the volume containing the user account.\nWhy does this happen?\n\nA: The Mac was probably encrypted with FileVault 2.\nYou don't normally have to enter a password to start up in single user mode, but if FileVault 2 is enabled, you do. If FileVault 2 is enabled, you can't use the Reset Password application to reset the password of an account either.\nIf FileVault is enabled, I don't think there is any way to erase and reinstall OS X without knowing the password or the encryption key. When I enabled FileVault on a VM and started up from the recovery partition, the erase tab was missing from Disk Utility, and I couldn't create another partition from Disk Utility. When I tried selecting Reinstall OS X, the list of volumes did not include the Macintosh HD volume.\nIf the previous owner enabled the option to store the recovery key with Apple, you might be able to retrieve the recovery key by contacting Apple support:\n\nTyping in the wrong login password three times prompts you if you have the ability to retreive your key from Apple. Click the triangle-button next to the prompt that appears to reveal a Recovery Key text field (which replaces the password text field) and AppleCare contact information, along with your computer's Serial Number and a Record Number. You need to provide these pieces of information in order for AppleCare to retrieve your recovery key.\n\nIf you can't get the recovery key from Apple and you can't contact the previous owner, your only option might be to replace the hard drive.\n(I also copied and pasted instructions for three ways to reset the password of an account below.

It seems with the upgrade to OS X 10.9 \"Mavericks\", the OS or Quick Look API has changed sufficiently that Perian no longer works.\nAre there any alternatives? Ideally a one-app-does-all like Perian, but even a list of individual codecs and/or plug-ins for video container files would be useful.\nNB: This question isn't about video players—there are many that support more than those playable via the built-in QuickTime player. This question is about codecs/plug-ins for QuickTime on OS X to allow it and Quick Look (and apps which rely on the OS to play videos) to open/play video files/formats lacking native support.\n\nA: \"QuickTime on Mavericks\" is not QuickTime anymore - it is \"AV Foundation\". QuickLook and QuickTime Player are based on this \"new QuickTime\".\n\"AV Foundation\" comes from iOS, was implemented for Mac OS X too and does not offer extensions (and will never) like codecs / plugins. As Apple says: anything else than MPEG-4 (H.264) is old stuff and must be converted.\nIn my opinion, it is confusing for users that Apple is still using the name \"QuickTime\". Because Mavericks still contains the \"old QuickTime\".\nQTKit is a bridge between the old QuickTime and the new QuickTime. It is not deprecated and contains a video converter. This way incompatible video formats can be converted to MPEG-4.\nIn other words: follow Apple's plan and convert all your videos. Then QuickLook will be available for you.\n\nA: I've uploaded QuickLook and Spotlight plugins here: https://github.com/Marginal/QLVideo/wiki . These allow Finder to display thumbnails, static previews, cover art and metadata for most types of video files, including .asf, .avi, .flv, .mkv, .rm, .webm, .wmf etc.\n\nA: This has to be the single most annoying change in Mavericks. From what I Understand the new version of Quicktime is not well enough documented to allow this development yet.\n\nA: Since this question is for Mavericks, you can do:\nsudo mv /System/Library/Frameworks/Quartz.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/QuickLookUI.framework/Versions/A/PlugIns/Movie.qldisplay /System/Library/Frameworks/Quartz.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/QuickLookUI.framework/Versions/A/PlugIns/AVFoundationMovie.qldisplay && ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/Quartz.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/QuickLookUI.framework/Versions/A/PlugIns/LegacyMovie.qldisplay /System/Library/Frameworks/Quartz.framework/Frameworks/QuickLookUI.framework/PlugIns/Movie.qldisplay\n\nOn Mavericks, this will bring back animated QuickLook previews for any format that has a QuickTime plugin.\nFor some reason, Apple left a QuickLook Display plugin in Mavericks called LegacyMovie.qldisplay which uses QuickTime instead of AVFoundation, and thus supports more types of media. However, QuickLook doesn't use this plugin, it uses the AVFoundation-based Movie.qldisplay instead.\nThe above terminal command renames Movie.qldisplay to AVFoundationMovie.qldisplay (so you have a backup) and then symlinks LegacyMovie.qldisplay to Movie.qldisplay, so QuickLook will use the QuickTime-based version. (LegacyMovie.qldisplay will still be available at its original location for anything that actually uses it).\nWith the above command and my updated FFusion QuickTime plugin, I'm able to view H265 and even VP9 videos in QuickLook! (As long as the video is 1080p or below; even unmodified QuickLook doesn't appear to like 4K regardless of the codec.)\nI think this might work on slightly newer OS's? I'm not sure when Apple got rid of LegacyMovie.qldisplay. It definitely won't work on Catalina, since the QuickTime framework is 32bit. Note that on 10.11 and above, you would need to (temporarily) disable System Integrity Protection.\nSorry I saw this question eight years too late!\n\nA: I highly recommend qlMoviePreview.\n", "Q: Emails are automatically marked as read after a few seconds I have a problem that potentially causes me to miss important email: An incoming message is automatically marked as read after a few seconds. One can watch how a new email is at first unread in the inbox and then turns to read.\nThis problem seems to occur only for one of several IMAP accounts. \nMy settings are: In the viewing tab a selection \"Mark all messages as read when opening a conversation\" check box is unset.\nWhat could cause this?\nHow can I diagnose if the problem is on the server side or if Mail.app is malfunctioning?\n\nA: I've been able to fix the issue: In fact, it was the fault of OS X Server.\n\nIn the server app, under the calendar tab, there is a checkbox \"activate invitations via e-mail\". The problem disappeared when I unchecked it! \n\nA: Uncheck (Mail->Preferences->Viewing) 'Use classic layout'.\n\nA: When setting up your email account, make sure to choose POP3 instead of IMAP.

Say, for example, if I have the iPhone 4S, and I select \"reset network settings\" in \"General\", would that enable me to change mobile carriers from AT&T to T-mobile? \n\nA: To change carriers you would need to talk to your carrier, if your phone is not locked all you need to do is change the sim card and then activate it.\nI've just changed to AT&T in the US from an Australian carrier and the process was very simple.\n\nA: If your phone is carrier locked : no. This won't do anything.\n", "Q: Mavericks sleep/hibernate causes high fan activity After updating to OS X 10.9, my 13-inch, Late 2011 MacBook Pro runs into trouble when going to sleep. About a minute after going to sleep, the fan suddenly starts running high, and keeps up doing so for about another minute (but that time is highly variable).\nThere are no other associated problems, I can wake the computer from sleep without problems. However, this activity is concerning. First of all, the computer gets extremely hot during that time (hence, I think, the fan activity), and of course the sleep process is quite delayed.\nI’ve noticed some weird log entries in my Console:\n21/12/2013 12:07:11.000 kernel[0]: PM notification timeout (pid 48014, Messages)\n21/12/2013 12:07:15.000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Sleep \n21/12/2013 12:07:18.000 kernel[0]: hibernate image path: /var/vm/sleepimage\n21/12/2013 12:07:18.000 kernel[0]: efi pagecount 43\n21/12/2013 12:07:18.000 kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall(preflight 1) start 0xffffff80f5dbe000, 0xffffff80f603e000\n21/12/2013 12:07:18.000 kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall time: 224 ms\n21/12/2013 12:07:18.000 kernel[0]: pages 1960650, wire 456636, act 439481, inact 53144, cleaned 0 spec 48, zf 199674, throt 0, compr 693907, xpmapped 8652081\n21/12/2013 12:07:18.000 kernel[0]: could discard act 6855 inact 76195 purgeable 18521 spec 16142 cleaned 47\n21/12/2013 12:07:18.000 kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall preflight pageCount 1842890 est comp 66 setfile 5267647972 min 4294967296\n…\n21/12/2013 12:07:20.000 kernel[0]: [0x1a5aeab000, 0x1000]\n21/12/2013 12:07:20.000 kernel[0]: [0x1a5aeb9000, 0x7000]\n21/12/2013 12:07:20.000 kernel[0]: [0x1a5aec3000, 0x1000]\n…\n21/12/2013 12:07:21.000 kernel[0]: [0x5a7a6f000, 0x39000]\n21/12/2013 12:07:21.000 kernel[0]: *** kernel exceeded 500 log message per second limit  -  remaining messages this second discarded ***\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall(preflight 0) start 0xffffff80f5dbe000, 0xffffff80f603e000\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall time: 281 ms\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: pages 1961557, wire 456989, act 439956, inact 53160, cleaned 0 spec 120, zf 199606, throt 0, compr 693907, xpmapped 8708503\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: could discard act 6855 inact 76248 purgeable 18521 spec 16148 cleaned 47\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall found pageCount 1843738\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: IOHibernatePollerOpen, ml_get_interrupts_enabled 0\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: IOHibernatePollerOpen(0)\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: encryptStart a44a0\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: bitmap_size 0x3f5a4, previewSize 0x359ac8, writing 1842596 pages @ 0x43d50c\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: encryptEnd 19175c00\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: image1Size 0x24c5b000, encryptStart1 0xa44a0, End1 0x19175c00\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: encryptStart 24c5b000\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: encryptEnd 11c0c5e00\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: PMStats: Hibernate write took 175406 ms\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: all time: 175406 ms, comp bytes: 7547641856 time: 6109 ms 1178 Mb/s, crypt bytes: 4568892768 time: 7119 ms 612 Mb/s, \n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: image 4765540352 (90%), uncompressed 7547641856 (794110), compressed 4749442640 (62%), sum1 4b91d7ac, sum2 a6e4a967\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: zeroPageCount 87345, wiredPagesEncrypted 337128, wiredPagesClear 118809, dirtyPagesEncrypted 1386749\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: hibernate_write_image done(0)\n21/12/2013 12:10:19.000 kernel[0]: sleep\n\n– After (what I’m assuming is) the normal hibernation initiation, the kernel goes crazy and spews memory addresses (?!) into the log. This only goes on for a few seconds, and the hibernate write itself takes 175406 ms ≈ 3 min (I’ve got 8 GB of RAM).\nWhat do these log entries mean? Do they hold any clue to solve this problem?\nOther people seem to have the same problem but there’s no definitive solution. The article seems to indicate that the computer shouldn’t hibernate immediately but much later, but it makes no mention at all of the weird addresses in the log.\n\nA: For whatever reason the kernel is encrypting the hibernation file and it's safe to assume that the encryption, as a CPU-intensive process, is causing the heating up. The Hibernation File, sometimes referred to as the 'sleepimage'-file, is usually the same size as your RAM and can sometimes get corrupted. \nI would recommend checking your Powermanagement-Settings within the Terminal by using the folowing command:\npmset -g\n\nYou should get a list of the urrent settings which you can interpret by typing 'man pmset' or by looking at the Docs provided by Apple here. Please check it the Setting for 'hibernatemode' is anything other than 3 (for Mac portables). Perhaps you can post the complete Settings.\nI would suggest you try to delete the sleepimage in case it is corrupted (even though i don't see any errors). You can do it within the Terminal with this command:\nsudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nIt will be recreated the next time your Mac goes into sleep-mode. Does the encryption still occur with the new sleepimage?\n\nA: My macbook does the same. I think this is intended behaviour because it tries to quickly cool itself down, because you might put it in a backpack and then it would be harder for the laptop to cool. So it does a quick cooldown procedure.\nThis is only a guess though.\n", "Q: How do I stop the sync attempts for an app? Whenever I sync my iPhone with iTunes, the phone tells me:\n\niTunes Sync\n1 item could not be synced. See iTunes for more information.\n\nAnd iTunes tells me:\n\nThe app \"The Elements\" was not installed on the iPhone \"[...]\" because not enough free space was available.\n\nThis makes sense, because the app \"The Elements\" is very large. But I don't want it on my iPhone anyway.\nHow can I stop the attempted sync of this specific app?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to iTunes and select the device.\n\n\n*Select the Apps tab.\n\n\n*Press the Will Install button so that it removes the status and returns to an Install button.\n →  → \n\n*Press Sync.\n\n", "Q: Don't know Macbook login password Recently I bought a used Macbook air but it was locked.\nThe seller was not reached by phone or email.\nSo I tried to factory reset or re-install the OS but all failed due to various reasons.\nI called Apple care, but they seem to misunderstand my question and tried to reset the password of 'my' Apple ID which is totally irrelevant. They said they cannot reset the seller's Apple password.\nWhen I failed three times in a login window, they gave me the serial number (of the Macbook) and the record number. Can I reset the login password using this information? What can I do to use this laptop?\nBy the way, is the computer log-in password same as the seller's Apple ID password???\n\nA: I don't believe a Mac can be locked to the point where you cannot even install a fresh OS. That would require a locking at firmware level, and I don't believe the MacBooks offer this option.\nYou should be able to restart, with the option (alt) key pressed, so that you get into the boot screen where you can choose to start up from the recovery system, and then re-install OS X from it, all without needing a password.\nOh, I see you also asked here: Resetting password for Macbook\nThere, you mention that you were able to get to the rescue screen with Cmd-R. So, why can't you re-install OS X then? It's offered as an option there, isn't it?\n\nA: Apple has a nice set of steps for resetting passwords. It also will fail if you have FileVault or firmware passwords so be sure to consider that if you run into problems following the steps. \n\n\n*\n\n*PH25720 - https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25720\n", "Q: Mac ignores \"Display login window as\" setting My Mac mini ignores the \"Display login window as\" setting. I have it set to \"Name and password\" but it still displays a \"List of users\" whenever it reboots.\nIt is a multi-boot setup. Does OS X for some reason store this setting in the vnram?\nUpdate: When I log out it shows name and password field. But when it comes back from a reboot it shows the list of users instead.\n\nA: Do you have FileVault 2 turned on? The FileVault 2 login screen isn't able to show username and password blanks; only names and icons.\n\nA: basically, login as user displayed, hit the logout button, it should display the user/password blanks, login as the domain user, setup the mobile user, and logout again, user will now show up in the menu.\n", "Q: What's the minimum partition size for osx mavericks when dual booting with windows 8? I used boot camp to setup dual booting between windows 8 and mac osx mavericks.\nTo get the most possible space for Windows 8, should I have formatted my computer first?\nI was able to partition my drive as:\n\n\n*\n\n*205 GB OSX \n\n*18 GB Available 295 GB Win8\n\n\nIt is a 500 GB hard drive.\nIf I formatted it first, could I have made the OSX partition smaller? If so, how much smaller?\n\nA: OS X Mavericks requires at least 8 GB of free space to install to. At least 15% of free space is recommended for updates and other such things.\nTherefore, the minimum space for OS X is 9.2 GB, or to be safe, 10 GB.\n\nSo yes, using Disk Utility to partition before you installed Boot Camp would have meant that you could have made the OS X partition smaller.\nYou can repartition now with software such as iPartition, which specifically works with Boot Camp partitions.\n", "Q: How do your rearrange the photo album icons in Photos for iPad? How do you rearrange the photo album icons in Photos for iPad? I don't want to rearrange the pictures in the albums, just the icons of the various photo albums.\n\nA: First, there is no way to move the \"Camera Roll\" album and the \"My Photostream\" album. These two albums are always at the top and in that order.\nTo arrange any other albums, including the automatically created \"Videos\", and \"Panoramas\" just tap \"Edit\" in the upper right corner. You can now tap (hold) and drag these albums around as you desire. They drag and drop in the same way that your home-screen icons do. When you have adjusted them as you like, you can tap the done button.\n\nA: I have wanted to re-organize my uploaded (from Picasa3 on my HP pc) photo albums in the \"Web Albums\" icon of my IPad.  I read the answer above and looked at my IPad and didn't see an \"Edit\" button on the main albums page.  But, I poked around and discovered how to do this.  If you click on your name at the top left of the screen it opens a menu of items including \"Settings.\"  Click on \"Settings\" then click on \"Viewing\" and then click on \"Album Sort.\"  This provides you with several ways of arranging your albums.  I clicked on \"A to Z\" and it instantly re-arranged my albums alphabetically, beginning with in ascending order those whose labels begin with years.  Finally, I can find my albums quickly without scrolling down looking through all of them.\n", "Q: Partition corruption, still can see files in single user mode, would like to retrieve files The problem started after forcing the mac to shutdown. Since then, when trying to boot, it stays stuck at the grey apple with spinning wheel.\nI've tried a few generic things to be able to access my data on my internal drive without success.\nI first tried booting on the restore partition from mountain lion, but the same apple with spinning wheel issue happens, which makes me think that it's the partition that's corrupted and not the Volume.\nI've tried booting the iMac in Target mode and do the following:\n1) I've tried using Disk Utility to repair the disk, but when trying to \"Repair Disk\" on the hardware item (not the volume one), the output gives:\nVerifying and repairing partition map for “AAPL FireWire Target Media”\nChecking prerequisites\nProblems were encountered during repair of the partition map\nError: Some information was unavailable during an internal lookup\n\n2) Data Rescue and Disk Warrior hang when I open them and when the Target disk is connected, but don't when I disconnect it.\nWhat make me thing that some data can be saved is the following\n3) Using single user mode, I can navigate through the different users’ folders, I can even open their text files.\ndoing the fsck -fy command outputs: The Volume Macintosh HD appears to be OK.\nWhen doing the /sbin/mount -uw / command, it outputs\nSATA WARNING: Enable auto-activate failed\ndisk0s2: I/0 error.\n\nfollowed by a few lines of gibberish followed by:\nhfs: cat_delete() failed to delete thread record on volume Macintosh HD\nhfs: Runtime corruption detected on Macintosh HD, fsck will be forced on     next mount\nhfs_remove_orphans: failed to start transaction\nhfs: hfc_btree_open: hfs_getnewvnode error 2\n\nSo I can’t mount the internal drive and I can’t seem to be able to mount an external drive to copy my files to it.\nIt seems that there’s no network connection in single user mode (unless I’m missing something), so I don’t believe I can send the data through networking and my laptop refuses to mount the Target disk.\nThere are some important documents I would like to save and I was wondering if there was some way to access the files on the hard drive the same way single user mode does it?\nThanks a lot for any answers!\n\nA: If you have some understanding of partition layouts, you could try using my disk editor iBored (http://apps.tempel.org/iBored/) to check the drive and its partition, search for the partitin start, then maybe copy just the partition data to a disk image file or to another disk's partition. All this can be done in iBored.\nYou could also try using iBored to erase the initial partition blocks (and save those blocks to a file first, so you could later restore them), to see if Data Rescue is then able to read the disk without hanging.\nAlso, you describe that in Single User mode, you tried to mount the (damaged) root disk as writable - that's not possible, clearly (since the volume is damaged). But have you tried to mount an external disk in writable mode? If that works, you could easily copy your files over then.\n", "Q: How to get the FileVault recovery key? I want to mount my (non-bootable) Filevault encrypted drive on Linux. I know the user-facing password to decrypt it, but not the recovery key. From what I've read, I assume that the recovery key is the actual XTS-AES-128 key. Linux can't decrypt the drive with a password, but it can with the AES key. There's obviously a way to obtain the recovery key given the password, since that's done every time you decrypt the drive with a password. Hence I need a way to get this recovery key.\nAlternatively, a Filevault driver for Linux would also be a way to mount my encrypted drive.\n\nA: You may be able to use libfvde to access FileVault 2 encrypted drives on Linux.\nOS X turns the password for the drive into a derived key by using PBKDF2. That derived key then unlocks the encrypted drive. I'm not aware of a way to display the key.\n", "Q: Display hidden files hot key on Mavericks gone? On prior versions of OS X, it was possible to display hidden files in a Finder dialog box (Open, Save, etc.) using Command-Shift-Period.\nIn Mavericks, that feature isn't working for me. Is there another command that one can use? I would prefer not to globally enable hidden files.\nEDIT: I'm the one offering the bounty. It seems I cannot comment because I don't have enough rep now :)\nSo... yes, I'm also running 10.9.1 and it does not work. I have used it in previous versions of OSX and it worked fine. The script mentioned is OK to show the hidden files in Finder, but it does not work that well when using the open/save dialog.\nMy use case: sometimes I need to open/save files to the /tmp directory. In previous versions of OSX I just used the dialog to get to the disk root, and then press CommandShift. and then I was able to see the /tmp directory (actually /private/tmp).\nSo, if you guys are using the same version of OSX and it does work for you, I guess there must be a way to re-activate this. Any ideas?\n\nA: The key bindings doesn't work in Column view mode on Maverick, but it works in e.g. List view mode. Switching back to Column view mode after doing the toggle in List view mode then shows the hidden files. \n\nA: I'm currently running OS X (10.9.1) and just tried the ⌘ + ⇧ + . keyboard shortcut in a save dialog box and it worked just fine.\nI've also setup an AppleScript on my machine with a keyboard shortcut of ^ + ⌘ + ⇧ + . which toggles the visibility of hidden files within Finder whenever I want.  This way I don't have to manually run a terminal command to show hidden files, and I can quickly turn it off to avoid accidentally modifying system files. I use FastScripts (also available in the Mac App Store) to allow me to set the keyboard shortcut for my AppleScript, and placed the AppleScript in my ~/Library/Scripts Folder.\nUpdate\nI've updated my script so that Finder does not need to be killed every time you wish to show/hide the display of hidden files. As markhunte pointed out, you can toggle the view state of the Finder window which will refresh the listing of contents. Thanks markhunte for pointing that out to me!

But then, I've always used a different way, one that still works in 10.9:\nThe system extension Default Folder X. It's an old goodie, and still working well.\nOne of its Advanced options is to hold down Option when choosing Open/Save etc. to show all files, including the hidden ones.\n\nA: It does still work, but it was buggy for me. \nI had to change directories and then return to the first folder. Then it displayed hidden files. \nIt doesn't help to close/reopen the dialog. I'm not sure how widespread the bug is or what the trigger could be (this laptop is less than 48 hours out of the box).\n\nA: The shortcut ⌘⇧. still works fine for me in Mavericks. It doesn't seem to have been changed since previous versions of OS X.\nSome things you can try…\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the folder you're looking at has hidden files/folders.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use ls in Terminal to see if there are hidden files/folders:\ncd /path/to/folder && ls -la\n\n\n\n*Make sure you've not remapped the shortcut to something else.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts for any mappings to ⌘⇧.\n\n*Check any 3rd party apps for mappings to ⌘⇧.\n\n\n\nA: As many others said, it still works perfectly fine. Maybe you changed a shortcut to this and that masks your intended task which is to show the hidden files.\n\nA: This is not a solution to a hot-key but I will share what I use for this task. Funter app\n\nA: You can turn it on by default doing this Terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true\nkillall Finder\n\n...but this is less than convenient compared to a keyboard shortcut... but you could create an Automator workflow which runs a service which runs a Terminal command all assigned to a System Preferences Keyboard Shortcut... but still not as convenient.\n", "Q: iTunes KERNELBASE.dll crash - Windows 7 Home Premium Since I have updated iTunes (11.1.3.8) on my home PC running Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 it constantly crashes after about using it for only a couple of minutes.\nWhen I check the Application log on the Event Viewer, i see the following Error info:\n\nLog Name: Application\n  Source: Application Error\n  Event ID: 1000\n  Level: Error\n  Event Details: \n  Faulting application name: iTunes.exe, version: 11.1.3.8, time stamp: 0x5274a87d\n  Faulting module name: KERNELBASE.dll, version: 6.1.7601.18229, time stamp: 0x51fb1116 \n  Exception code: 0x80000003  \n  Fault offset: 0x00013219 \n  Faulting process id: 0x2328\n  Faulting application start time: 0x01cefe992ffab867 \n  Faulting application path: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\iTunes\\iTunes.exe \n  Faulting module path: C:\\Windows\\syswow64\\KERNELBASE.dll \n  Report Id: d3dfd01c-6a8c-11e3-a1e4-0024e812336e\n\nI do notice another error that accompanies this erro very shortly after this event others.

I guess I have to throw this shitOS away, and get a proper PC with GNU/Linux. \n\nA: Memory being used doesn’t mean the memory can’t be used for anything else. Mavericks will put idle memory to work if it can.\nFor instance, 2.5G is being used for file cache — storing files in memory so it doesn’t have to hit the disk for them. As you consume more memory, that will go away.\nNow, if it crashed on you due to swap pressure, you may not have enough memory for the work you’re doing with the machine (Or maybe not enough free disk.), but there’s no indication you have a problem right away.\nI have 4GB on a non-retina MBP. It’s been up for four days, I run a fair amount of crap. It’s using 3.96GB of that memory, and hasn’t touched swap at all. (It’s also compressed about a gig of memory.)\n", "Q: OSX vs Vim: a war for the Function keys Is there a way to quickly toggle the \"use F1, F2, etc as standard function keys\" in OSX?

I've been seeing odd click behaviour for a while. Whenever I have my magic trackpad plugged in, Mavericks seems to be registering a number of clicks I'm not making. This results in making the system near unusable at times as it'll randomly cause textfields I'm writing in to be highlighted and then typed over, or for full-screen videos to pause and unpause as the clicks register.\nThis happens during most sessions, on and off, and whether or not I'm touching the trackpad.\nThere are no issues if I use a mouse, as long as the magic trackpad has had the batteries removed.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this behaviour?\n\nA: It would appear that the trackpad itself was faulty. It's unclear exactly how this fault developed, but I found that switching out the trackpad for another fixed the problem.

I've set it up in Settings, but can't connect to the machine from another computer!\nOn the other computer I set up the connection with the correct IP address, username and password. Then when I try to connect, it shows a dialog in which the server asks for password. Then I enter the correct password, and shows the dialog again and again. If I dismiss the dialog, the client shows a this message:\n\nLogon failure: incorrect username and password\n\nHowever I'm sure the username and password are correct. (If it matters, the client is just an android tablet with a samba client app. The same app handles Windows shares without any problem.)\nHas anyone faced a similar problem?\nMy OS X version is Mavericks.\n\nA: Samba passwords are managed separately from your regular account password. Have you set-up your user to enable samba sharing in the options menu? You need to do it once otherwise the login won't work.\nIn the File Sharing preference pane tick the checkbox next to the user you want to enable file sharing for and a window will pop-up asking you to authenticate.\nAs soon as this is done you should be able to login from your android tablet.\n\nUPDATE\nThe root cause of the issue might be that 10.9 uses a new SMB2 Stack completely written by Apple (SAMBA is not used anymore). Apple's SMB2 implementation is not compatible with many other SMB2 NAS products on the market today while Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 work just fine. In short, it's an Apple bug.\nAs a workaround you can force OSX to use SMB1 instead of SMB2 using a configuration file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the Terminal\n\n*Paste the following line followed by a return key (command should be one single line)\necho \"[default]\" >> ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf; echo \"smb_neg=smb1_only\" >> ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*A file called nsmb.conf is created in your home directory at the path ~/Library/Preferences/\n\n*It adds the lines to force the use of SMB1 protocol instead of Apple's SMB2 (this is slower but more stable)\n\n\nA: If it's an option for you, you could possibly install SMBUP which replaces OS X's Samba (and it tries to be more or less compatible in the environment of Windows machines too). Of course, there are some caveats but when I had nearly the same issues with sharing Mac files over SMB it helped me out. Worked well in Leo - can't confirm if it works in Mavericks at all though.\n\nHere are some more words on SMBUp:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://donmorris.com/on/smb-and-mac-os-x-lion  \n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/message/17495509#17495509\n\nA: Click more options.

My daughter and I have been sharing one iCloud account for our iPhone.  She has her own Apple ID to purchase music. I need her to have her own iCloud account as mine is running out of storage. She is afraid if I delete her phone from my iCloud in my settings she will lose all of her contacts etc. Then is there a way to move items from one iCloud account to a newly created one?\n\nA: When your daughter disconnects her phone from the shared iCloud account (by deleting it in Settings) she will be given the option to keep her contacts, calendar entries etc. on the phone. Afterwards just create a new iCloud account directly from the phone.\n\nA: First to be sure to backup the important contacts, ask your daughter to backup contacts using a Google Account.\nSteps are mentioned here\nAfter backing up the contacts just make another iCloud account and use it on one of the phones.\n", "Q: bless --nextonly parameter fails I am using the bless command to reboot my Mac mini into VMware ESX.\nsudo bless --device /dev/disk3s1 --setboot --nextonly && sudo reboot\n\nBooting ESX works but after the next reboot the Mac reboots into ESX again, despite the \"--nextonly\" parameter.\nThe same command (with a different device) works for rebooting into Windows on the Boot Camp partition once, i.e. after booting into Windows the Mac mini reboots into OS X again. But it doesn't work with booting into ESX.\nAny ideas?\nUpdate: With the --legacy switch the nvram variable is changed to boot from USB and uses the BIOS emulator, which promptly boots from the Windows partition. So that doesn't work.\n\nA: Try using the --legacy flag:\nsudo bless --device /dev/disk3s1 --legacy --setboot --nextonly reboot\n\n(not sure why you're using the && operator; try the command without it)\nI encountered a similar issue a while back; the --legacy flag apparently was needed due to the EFI compatibility at the time.

It sticks to the value it fetches when rebooting the phone. Currently, it shows 58% regardless that it's been charging for hours. If I reboot it, however, I get an accurate value, and it sticks to that one.\n\n*I get the following error message in the Console when plugging it to Xcode:\n\n\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: partial sensors: count 5156, current 39fffe, mask 1b, expected 1b\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: Could not get event from temperature service\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: Could not get value for gas gauge battery\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: Could not get event from temperature service\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: Could not get value for gas gauge battery\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: Could not get event from temperature service\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: Could not get value for gas gauge battery\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: Could not get event from temperature service\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: Could not get value for gas gauge battery\n    CLTM[14] : CLTM: partial sensors: count 5160, current 39fffe, mask 1b, expected 1b\n\nThe value in partial sensors: count XX increases as the iPhone runs.\n\n*\n\n*After rebooting, with the battery too charged or too discharged, the iPhone enters a reboot loop, where it will reboot every 5 minutes. Eventually, when the battery reaches 75% or so, it remains on. At that point, I can use it \"normally\", with a wrong battery indicator.\n\nHere's the tricky thing: I live in Argentina where the iPhone is not officially for sale, and no authorised services are available. I got it when travelling to the US.\nI can easily have the battery replaced (parts are available and not too expensive), but if it's not the battery (maybe the charging circuit?). Since the service is not authorised, however, I'm reluctant to have them open my iPhone if it won't solve the issue.\nMy question(s) therefore are:\n\n*\n\n*Did anyone experience something like this? If so, was the problem the battery?\n\n*Does anyone know what CLTM in the Console log could mean?\n\n*Is the battery level meter part of the battery itself (and therefore will be fixed when changing the battery) or is it a separate thing?\n\n\nA: It might not help the OP, but Apple has battery replacement program for iPhone 5. You can check eligibility on Apple site\n\nApple has determined that a very small percentage of iPhone 5 devices may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently. The affected iPhone 5 devices were sold between September 2012 and January 2013 and fall within a limited serial number range.\n  (...)\nThe program covers affected iPhone 5 batteries for two years after the first retail sale of the unit or until March 1, 2015, whichever provides longer coverage.\n\n\nA: I believe the battery level meter is run by the chip. So I would think that the battery has corrupted the input going into the chip. From your explanation, I think that the battery was sold just with a series of logic boards in the battery slightly out of place, yet still running. Then the iPhone overheated the slightly defective wires slightly warped the battery with the heat. I would suggest getting the battery replaced.\n", "Q: Relay calls from one phone to another Does anyone know of an app (on iOS, Android or any platform) that will allow me to place one phone in a part of my house that has good phone signal, and have it relay all calls to another device using my home's WiFi?\n\nA: Yes - handsfree bluetooth accessories will work to extend the range a good 25 or more feet in many cases. You could also rig a wire and have much, much longer extension, but I can't imagine wanting to be wired to the phone and using a handsfree in that manner.\nThere are many, many mobile base stations that work with all manner of cellular towers and technologies, so those would be my next choice if you can't get the phone close enough to reception for bluetooth to extend the range to your body.\n", "Q: Updating OS X Mavericks without entering payment information? A while back I created a Apple ID for my self on a loaned iPhone 4 at work.\nRecently my partner upgraded her MacBook Pro to Mavericks, and being the IT guy in the house, I installed the first few updates that popped up after signing in with my Apple ID on my user account.\nToday she received more update notifications on her account, so she proceeded to install them. She was asked for my account password. Strange that that carries across user accounts, but okay... clicked the Store menu, Create Account. All goes fine, until the billing information step. Neither of us has a credit card, nor do we understand why one is needed for system updates.\nI looked around for a solution and came across this article in Apple's knowledge base:\nCreating an iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store, and Mac App Store account without a credit card.\nIt suggests using \"None\" as the payment option, but such an option does not show up for us.\nNow I know similar questions have been asked before, but none seem to answer this question: How to update Mac OS X Mavericks without entering any payment info?\nAlso: Why can I install updates even though I haven't entered any billing info either? We don't have any iOS devices to try to duplicate the results.\n\nA: I think I solved it.\nThe reason my partner was asked for an Apple ID in her user account in the first place, was because I was signed in to the App Store with my ID under my user account. After signing out of the App Store on my account and logging back into her account, she was no longer asked to enter my password or an Apple ID altogether anymore.\nI would consider this a pretty strange bug, an apparently rare but easily reproduced one at that, but perhaps this will help other people who share a Mac.\n", "Q: How to transfer iTunes library between user accounts on Windows? I have Windows 7 and the latest iTunes. My original user account, where my library is, seems to have contracted a virus so it's sky-rocketing my internet usage.

I am working under OS X 10.9.1 (Mavericks), using Terminal, which reports that it is GNU bash, version 3.2.51(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin13)\nI noticed some weird issues where history was not working properly: history -a and history -a filename.txt don't do anything.  history shows the history I would expect.  This breaks my .bashrc synchronization of history across terminals.\nI started to investigate by manually changing bash HIST variables.  Here is how I am able to reproduce my problem under somewhat controlled conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I disabled my .bashrc\n\n*I opened a new terminal window and cleared the history\nhistory -c\n\n\n*I confirmed that my PROMPT_COMMAND is back to normal/default:\necho $PROMPT_COMMAND\n\nThis returns: update_terminal_cwd;\n\n*I manually set the relevant HIST variables:\nexport HISTFILE=\"/Users/rsage/temp_history.txt\"\nexport HISTSIZE=20000\nexport HISTFILESIZE=20000\n\n\n*I confirm my test history files are deleted:\nls *history*.txt # To make sure I know what I'm about to delete\nrm *history*.txt\n\n\n*I attempt to save the history using history -a with no luck\nhistory -a\nhistory -a history_a.txt\nls -ltr ; date\n\nThis latter shows no history files:\n...\ndrwx------+ 40 rsage  staff   1360 Dec 20 14:16 Desktop\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 rsage  staff    136 Dec 20 18:48 webApps\ndrwxr-xr-x   8 rsage  staff    272 Dec 22 09:11 code\ndrwxr-xr-x  17 rsage  staff    578 Dec 22 09:26 stuff\n\nSun Dec 22 10:17:50 PST 2013\n\n*...but I stumbled across the history -w command (I know it overwrites the file, which is fine with my nominal bashrc) and this seems to work fine:\nhistory -w\nhistory -w history_w.txt\nls -ltr ; date\n\nwhich produces the expected results:\n...\ndrwx------+ 40 rsage  staff   1360 Dec 20 14:16 Desktop\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 rsage  staff    136 Dec 20 18:48 webApps\ndrwxr-xr-x   8 rsage  staff    272 Dec 22 09:11 code\ndrwxr-xr-x  17 rsage  staff    578 Dec 22 09:26 stuff\n-rw-------   1 rsage  staff    461 Dec 22 10:19 temp_history.txt\n-rw-------   1 rsage  staff    494 Dec 22 10:19 history_w.txt\n\nOne last note.  It occurred to me that my sizes might be too large, so I just tried 200 and no change to behavior (the thirties are the history output numbers):\n34  export HISTFILESIZE=200\n35  export HISTSIZE=200\n36  history -a\n37  history -a history_a.txt\n38  ls -ltr ; date\n\nThe ls outputs show no new files.\n\nA: I noticed the same odd behavior, checked permissions, and sure enough, both the \"World\" and \"System\" had explicit permissions set to read AND write my .bash_history file, but I (the owner) had no permissions to that file at all!\nI just forced \"World\" to \"No Access\" and gave myself and system r/w access and voila, everything is working the way it should.\n\nA: For El Capitan (10.11.6) I ran into history -a not working - https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/473581/135943\nCopying my self-answer from there:\n\nIt seems this is something Apple-specific.  (I'm using Mac OS 10.11.6 El Capitan.)\nMy HISTFILE value is the immediate cause:\n[512] $ echo $HISTFILE\n/Users/Wildcard/.bash_sessions/8BC6B122-0D74-445B-B6A0-7D4D446598CB.historynew\n\nBut since I don't set that variable, where is it being set?\nAha, it's in /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal.  And from the comments there, it looks like I only ran into this because I tried history -a by itself, without ever setting shopt -s histappend.  They've coded it so that if you turn on histappend, or set the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable, they skip the session resume support code.\nHere's the inline documentation for that section:\n# Resume Support: Save/Restore Shell State\n#\n# Terminal assigns each terminal session a unique identifier and\n# communicates it via the TERM_SESSION_ID environment variable so that\n# programs running in a terminal can save/restore application-specific\n# state when quitting and restarting Terminal with Resume enabled.\n#\n# The following code defines a shell save/restore mechanism. Users can\n# add custom state by defining a shell_session_save_user_state function\n# that writes restoration commands to the session file at exit. e.g.,\n# to save a variable:\n#\n#   shell_session_save_user_state() { echo MY_VAR=\"'$MY_VAR'\" >> \"$SHELL_SESSION_FILE\"; }\n#\n# During shell startup the session file is executed. Old files are\n# periodically deleted.\n#\n# The default behavior arranges to save and restore the bash command\n# history independently for each restored terminal session. It also\n# merges commands into the global history for new sessions. Because\n# of this it is recommended that you set HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to\n# larger values.\n#\n# You may disable this behavior and share a single history by setting\n# SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 0. There are some common user customizations\n# that arrange to share new commands among running shells by\n# manipulating the history at each prompt, and they typically include\n# 'shopt -s histappend'; therefore, if the histappend shell option is\n# enabled, per-session history is disabled by default. You may\n# explicitly enable it by setting SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 1.\n#\n# The implementation of per-session command histories in combination\n# with a shared global command history is incompatible with the\n# HISTTIMEFORMAT variable--the timestamps are applied inconsistently\n# to different parts of the history; therefore, if HISTTIMEFORMAT is\n# defined, per-session history is disabled by default.\n#\n# Note that this uses PROMPT_COMMAND to enable per-session history\n# the first time for each new session. If you customize PROMPT_COMMAND\n# be sure to include the previous value. e.g.,\n#\n#   PROMPT_COMMAND=\"${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND; }your_code_here\"\n#\n# Otherwise, the per-session history won't take effect until the first\n# restore.\n#\n# The save/restore mechanism is disabled if the following file exists:\n#\n#   ~/.bash_sessions_disable\n\n\nA: I have two answers - why the procedure does not work and why my original problem happened.\nhistory -a issue\nIn addition to the procedure for repeating this above, I started systematically building my .bashrc up from the ground up.  Pretty quickly I determined that it's the history -c that wrecks everything.\nIf you do the procedure with or without the history -c, you find that history -a works if history -c has not been called in the instance of bash and history -a fails if history -c has been called.\nsolution to original problem\nThat answer was not very satisfying - particularly since the issue is that my .bashrc formula relies on history -c as part of propagating history (the standard export PROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND\" shown at Preserve bash history in multiple terminal windows among other places).\nWithout fixing this above issue, it seems that the history propagation issue results from using a (relative) path in HISTFILE.  HISTFILE seems to want a filename with no path.  Thus, changing from HISTFILE=\"~/.bash_history_shared\" to HISTFILE=\".bash_history_shared\" fixes the original problem.  \nThat raises the obvious question if that would fix the first issue shown above.  It seems not to.  That being said, the fact that the  export PROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND\" works seems to suggest that perhaps the bizarre to me behavior of history -a is not unusual...?\n", "Q: TrueCrypt and OSX Fuse I installed OSX Fuse via Brew, as installing it via official installer causes brew doctor to go all crazy.

How do I get that with brew?\n\nA: I run into this type of problem frequently. I use a strict umask (0077) in my shell.  Usually, when brew is done installing, the dynamic libraries will have the same restrictive mask and the software I just installed doesn't work as a different user. Check the permissions on /usr/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib. It might be accessible only by the brewer, which could explain why TrueCrypt can't find it.\nSince HomeBrew symlinks everything, you may have to change the permissions on the symlink itself, and the file to which it is pointing. For the symlink, use the -h option:\nchmod -h a+rX /usr/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib\n\nWhile you're at it, check to see if other files have the same problems.\nFinally, sudo inherits the umask of the sudo-er. If umask is the culprit here, you might want to also check the permissions for the file-system bundle that you copied as an admin. If those are a problem, use\nsudo chmod -R a+rX /Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Internal SSD: Create a partition in unallocated space I have a MacBookPro 13\" Retina late 2013 with an internal SSD, there is 1TB unallocated space, I tried Disk Utility but it doesn't let me create a new partition there (it just does nothing when I click 'Apply').

On windows, there is setup.exe file, for example. On mac, I get different files (incompatible (classic) Starcraft Installer.app, some other folders) that don't exist when I insert the CD on windows\nSo, in short - CD has different files when mounted on windows, and when mounted on mac. I want to mount the 'windows' version of the starcraft cd on mac. How?\nI tried making a cd image under windows (daemon tools lite), but when I mounted iso file, guess what, same thing happened. \n\nA: This happens because you mount CD in mixed format that has separate files for Mac and for PC. You need to edit image with utility like Ultraiso/Toast to make it Win only.\nFor old Mac games I suggest you to using virtual machine with Mac version that can handle classic applications instead of running Wine port. (Actually this is not my idea, it is Apple's decision. After removing Rosetta this is all that we have)\n", "Q: How to make @ key work? Have bought Mac air 11 inch today. Cannot make @ key function.

Is something wrong/broken?\n\nA: Maybe your keyboard does not match the settings in your System Preferences. It would be good to include the layout of your keyboard i.e. English UK, English US, or maybe another language's default.\nTo check your System Preferences setup go: System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Input Sources. There you will find which button layout is set.\nBy matching that to your actual keyboard layout you may be successful resolving your issue.\n\nA: It seems like a localization problem, your keyboard seems to be configured to a profile different the one represented on its key's markings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Keyboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Input Sources:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*On the bottom left, click the + and add whichever keyboard is appropriate to your MacBook.

As such, they do not show up on my purchases list in the App Store.\n\nA: Your old iWork versions are not removed, so you can safely upgrade and keep both versions.\nAs Apple rolls \"upgrades\" to the newer version back in you can decide when it has restored sufficient functionality for it to do what you need it to.\nSorry if this doesn't specifically answer your question but it will get rid of the updates reminder...\n\nA: If others search for how to disable automatic updates for an application downloaded from App Store, you can hide the application from the Purchases tab.

I've got a MacBook Pro with Retina display and I've got a ton of stickers on it. Is there a method for removing the stickers from the back without damaging the finish and without leaving sticky residue on the laptop?\nIs this something I can get help with from the Genius Bar?\n\n\nA: I first peeled off the paper sticker and then rubbed softly with alcohol wipes. It came off surprisingly fast. I can see the shiny apple again.\n\nA: Some stickers are made with a water soluble glue, others with an organic soluble glue.\nPeel what you can off first, by hand. Once you've pried an edge up, pull slowly and carefully, not letting the angle between laptop surface and label get too large. That encourages separation of lable and glue layer. If it comes off clean, great! If not, fingernails, or a guitar pick can often get the last bits off without surface damage. If you've still got some residue, try soapy water. Give it some time to work, then go with the fingernail/guitar pick. If no joy, the glue is probably organic soluble. Any of the Limonene based orange oil cleaners should take care of that for you. Orange cleaner is available in any hardware store, and most grocery stores.\n\nA: Just peel off the stickers.\nThe best thing for removing the residue is Teatree oil. You can get it from Walgreens in the US, and most chemists in Australia.\nJust soak some cotton wool (or other soft cloth) in the oil (so you don't scratch the surface of your MacBook) and wipe until no residue is left.\nBecause the oil is viscous I would make sure that your TimeMachine backup is  up to date before use.  Don't kiss your brand new looking Mac as the oil is poisonous if ingested.\n\nA: I've found it most effective to use a combination of hydrogen peroxide and rubbing alcohol. They hydrogen peroxide may seem a little weird, but it does a much better job at cleaning up large clumps of goo (in my limited experience). My process: \n\n\n*\n\n*Peel off as much of the sticker as possible\n\n*Pat a paper towel (or another cloth) with hydrogen peroxide and rub away large spots of goo\n\n*Pat another paper towel with rubbing alcohol and rub remaining streaks away for a nice polished finish\n\n\nA: I have used Goo Gone, orange liquid, to remove a sticker from the back of an iPad.\n\nA: After the stickers are peeled off, alcohol, a washcloth, and iteration worked surprisingly well for me, getting off the residue.\nAnd at least during COVID times, 70% rubbing alcohol is approved by Apple.\n\nIs it OK to use a disinfectant on my Apple product?\nUsing a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox Disinfecting\nWipes, you may gently wipe the hard, nonporous surfaces of your Apple\nproduct, such as the display, keyboard, or other exterior surfaces.\nDon't use bleach. Avoid getting moisture in any opening, and don't\nsubmerge your Apple product in any cleaning agents. Don't use on\nfabric or leather surfaces.\n\nLink:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172\n\nA: If you're in the UK then there's a wonderful thing called 'sticky stuff remover' which pretty much DWISOTT - I have to confess I haven't used it on my MBP yet (though I have stickers on it so I may need to at some point!) but I very much doubt it will damage the surface.\n\nA: Goo Off will take anything off of anything. It's amazing and highly toxic so wear rubber gloves and be careful not to let it drip into the actual computer or any crevices.\n\nA: I recommend acetone (nail polish remover). It's not as toxic as some of these other recommendations. \n\nA: I took the sticker off as best as I could, at a right angle. Then I dabbed the residue with an alcohol swab, and rubbed it with a tissue and it worked for me\n\nA: I used some nailpolish remover, worked just fine! :)\n\nA: I've found I can get a lot of the residue off with the sticker itself. After removing, then with your index finger press the backing of the sticker firmly onto a spot of residue and a lot of the residue comes right off on to the sticker backing. Repeat many times. I can get 90+% of the residue off this way. Then rubbing alcohol whatever to get the lingering stuff.\n\nA: Sticky label remover (UK), it reactivates the glue so you can peel off the stickers and reuse them (i.e. It makes dried glue sticky again) it comes in a spray can with a 90 degree pointy nozzle. \n\nA: Just did this (July 2015) and it's a three-step process:\nStep 1: Using fingernail, and going slow, peel sticker off laptop\nStep 2: Using a wet paper towel and a thumbnail sized drop of soap, clean laptop surface\nStep 3: ... actually I guess it's just two steps.  \nWorked great!  No damage, good as new.\n\nA: I used nail polish remover with a towel and it worked wonders, I wouldn't anything else. Once I was finished I used these anti-static wipes made by Endust to make it feel new again. Please don't ruin your 1k+ computer with WD40 or Goo Gone.\n\nA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhMGB0tLfnc try this.\nPeel off the stickers.\nJust apply any perfume with alcohol. Wait a couple of minutes than just clean it off with a clean dry tissue.\nhttp://www.decorsfuk.co for more cleaning stickers from your devices.\n\nA: In the past, I've also had success with removing whatever residue is left with a rubber eraser! It usually picks up every bit of glue. Unfortunately, I haven't tried on my MB, but I don't doubt that it will work.\n\nA: peppermint essential oil works as well\n", "Q: Offline (Python) documentation? (for ActivePython Mac or similar) I'm a long-time user of ActivePython, and also own a couple of Komodo licenses.\nI've recently moved to the Mac, and one thing that I'm missing a lot is the \"offline\" documentation (i.e., in Windows Help format) that was included with ActivePython.\nIs there a Mac \"equivalent\" of that documentation? I'm not always online when banging away on some script (actually I've found that plane trips are great for some quick coding) so \"googling it\" doesn't work.\n\nA: You can download the Python documentation directly from python.org, see Python Documentation for details.\nYou can also use pydoc in Terminal to access the documentation already stored on your Mac.\n\nA: Thanks for the answers and suggestions so far. Finally the \"answer\" I've found has  several components:\n\n\n*\n\n*As @patrix commented, the offline docs in the Python home page are a good starting point (duh!) - Specially the PDF version as that's pretty searchable.\n\n*Updating ActivePython to the latest version (2.7.5.6) also added documentation in file:///Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Help/index.html - so it comes closer to the \"experience\" of the CHM docs that come with the Windows version; the search still seems to be a bit odd, but it might be an issue of getting used to it...\n\n*...

The Photos tab in iTunes for the device is only for syncing photos/videos from an iPhoto/Aperture library or folder to your device.

When I try to text to someone using my Ipad, it won't go through. What is \"iMessage\" and is that the problem?\n\nA: I don't believe any carrier offers straight SMS from an iPad so you will either need an app that contacts an SMS sending service from the App Store or to ensure that your recipient signs up for iMessage.\nApple provides iMessage for free and it replaces SMS as opposed to interfacing with the SMS.\nSo, you could only send iMessages to Computers that run iMessage and iOS devices that run iMessage - but not actually send a SMS to cell phones.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/ios/messages/\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2755\nIf iMessage seems to be something you want to try - sign up for free according to the instructions on the first link. The second link explains the difference between SMS, MMS and iMessage services and when they can commingle on iPhone. Again, iPads only support iMessage out of the box (i.e. without adding a third party app).\n\nA: I had the same problem but i fixed it through checking the person's number im going to text with and put the area code of his/her country that you're going to text with.

Yesterday, I wanted to set it up to handle backups through the network. In the Time Machine interface, I selected \"Remove Disk\" for this WD drive and confirmed \"Stop Using This Disk\" in the following confirmation. This confirmation states that \"Your existing backups will not be deleted.\"\nAfter playing around with the network setup, I found it wouldn't work to my needs and decided to just get the drive set back up with my laptop. After clicking \"Select Backup Disk\" and then \"Use Disk\" for the HD, it's as if that drive has never been used before. See screenshot below:\n\nFurthermore, when entering into Time Machine, none of my backups appear in the UI. When browsing the drive through the Finder, the Time Machine files are still there, so I know that the data is not lost.

For best results, it is important that the proper\n  release of Tcl/Tk is installed on your machine.\n[...]\nIf you are using Python from a python.org 64-bit/32-bit Python\n  installer for Mac OS X 10.6 and later, you should only use IDLE or\n  tkinter with an updated third-party Tcl/Tk 8.5, like ActiveTcl 8.5\n  installed.\nIf you are using OS X 10.9 Mavericks and a Python from a python.org\n  64-bit/32-bit installer, application windows may not update properly\n  due to a Tk problem. Install the latest ActiveTcl 8.5.15.0 if\n  possible. (Also, a critical OS X 10.9 problem that could cause Python\n  to crash when used interactively has been fixed in the current 3.3.3,\n  2.7.6, and pre-release 3.4.0 64-bit/32-bit installers.)\n\n\nA: When in doubt cycle power.\nThen if IDLE continues to not start:\nWhen you uninstalled did you delete the savedState file from:\n~/Library/Saved Application State/\nIf not try using AppCleaner to delete everything associated with IDLE and reinstall.\nOne other thing to think of: Have you moved or renamed the working folder? Some apps don't like it when you move/rename their folder.\nYou could also try an earlier version (assuming you have the latest version, if not try that) and see if it will run.\n", "Q: How can I fix the Spotlight index for an encfs-mounted directory? Until recently, on OS X 10.8, I was using Alfred (which in turn uses Spotlight) to search files and directories on an encfs-mounted partition (which is mounted off a folder in my Dropbox directory).\nI used to use the command sudo mdutil -i on ~/Dropbox-encfs to enable indexing for that partition once it had been mounted (typically, I remounted every time I rebooted).\nHowever, since upgrading to OS X 10.9, entering the same command returns the error Error: unknown indexing state. Indexing and searching on my main root partition continues to work:\n~$ sudo mdutil -a -s\n/:\n    Indexing enabled.\n/Users/myuserdirectory/Dropbox-encfs:\n    Error: unknown indexing state.\n\nHas something changed in OS X 10.9 that might cause this? How would I go about debugging or fixing this problem?\nI'm using encfs version 1.7.4p1. I've already tried turning on and off the indexing (-i on, -i off), and using the -E flag to mdutil to erase the store.\nI mount the encfs partition using the following command:\nsudo encfs --public -ovolname=Dropbox-encfs ~/Dropbox/.encfs-crypted ~/Dropbox-encfs\nAside from the indexing problem, the mounted encfs partition otherwise seems to work fine.\nI should add that I am also seeing warnings of this form in /var/log/system.log:\nDec 23 14:51:20 montpelier.local mds[57]: (Warning) Volume:\nvsd:0x7ffe0c826c00 Open failed.  failureCount:7\n\n\nA: Appending the option -o local to the mount (i.e. encfs) command seems to work...\n", "Q: Drive Genius 3 Demo does not have a menu.

The backups done under mavericks don't come up but I am sure they are on my external hard drive. \n\nA: Having similar problem.  After several calls regarding a slow iMac, I was told to erase the main disk and restore from my back ups.  Last backup was in Sept which I recall was when I upgraded to Mavericks.  My Time Machine disk does have my very latest backup its just the recovery process can't see it!\nThe solution I've been given is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do latest restore possible (last Mountain Lion backup)\n\n*Install OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)\n\n*Copy latest user folder from time machine and replace the current user folder to recover the latest documents and files.\n\n\nNot ideal and takes a long time!\n", "Q: Microsoft Office 2011 interface blurred on Retina display I am using Microsoft Office 2011 Suite on my MacBook Pro with Retina Display.\nThe user interfaces are super blur as shown below.\n\n\nAm I missing out some patches or paddings or MS Office does not support retina display at all?\n\nA: According to Microsoft, they've supported Retina Display since version 14.2.4. If you are using an older version of Office 2011, then you should upgrade.\n\nA: Updating the Version itself which can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads at the bottom of the website.

I want to write a script that searches a web page for an updated file, then downloading it when detected. There is no command I have found that does this, accept Automator's download URL function, that I believe just gets the HTML, not the file. \nTell me if I am wrong or if AppleScript can do such a task? \nP.S. I would not like to use any Internet libraries.\n\nA: You have a couple options here, oh the power of a mac!\nOption 1:\nUse the curl command, documented here.\nI would use AppleScript to run the Curl command and any other command you need to run in order to fetch the file you need to analyze, process it to check for the updated file, and then use the curl command again to download the updated file.\nIf you don't want to use AppleScript, Automator is another option.\nOption 2:\nUsing Applescript, you could have it trigger another script written in perl, php, or the language of your liking, which could be written to do the same fetching, analysis, and fetching of the updated file.  This will provide you the flexibility to write in whatever language you choose based on your comfort level with that language.\nAn example of writing an AppleScript to trigger another file could be:\ndo shell script \"php ~/Library/Scripts/MyCustomScript.php\"\n\nFor either option, if you write an AppleScript you can use a program like FastScripts (Also available in the Mac App Store), which adds an icon to the menu bar through which you can easily access your AppleScripts to execute them, but it also provides the added benefit of being able to assign keyboard shortcuts to your AppleScript to trigger them even faster.\n\nA: Use wget\nApplescript can also do this easily.\nI would use the wget command with a bash script and run it using the the osascript -e command.\n", "Q: iPad exchange warranty transfer I bought a 4th-gen iPad in May. Recently the home button has started sticking. I'm going to take it to the Apple Store for an exchange.\nMy question is, will the warranty transfer to the new iPad (i.e. expiring in May 2014) or will it only have a 30 day warranty or something similar?\n\nA: Any time Apple services a part under warranty, you get 90 days of warranty and the balance of whatever warranty was pre-existing. Both of these periods run independently (i.e. you have 5+ months left, so your original warranty end date governs and you don't add + 90 days to your term.)\nIn the case where hardware serial numbers change or a whole unit is swapped, the warranty transfers day for day and does not get shortened or extended.\nSome locations have warranty tolling where you get credit for days where the unit is out of the consumer's hands for repair, but in the case of swap exchanged - that usually is zero days unless they don't have the part and need to order it.\nYou can look up your exact warranty based on where you bought your iPad from:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/\n", "Q: Core Graphics on a 2013 Mac Mini My python script imports from quartz.coregraphics.

I'm wondering if my mid-2010 Macbook Pro will be more stressed than it should if I run a 22-inch monitor in clamshell mode.  It seems to be whirring more than usual when I do this, so am I better off just getting an iMac?\n\nA: Not sure how to answer this objectively, but running it in \"clamshell mode\" is fine. I've been doing the same for a long time with my MacBook Pro with no issues.\nIf your external screen is bigger (resolution-wise) than your laptop's native screen, then it will of course need some more graphics power to run, but this is rarely an issue in practice.\n", "Q: Can gray weekend coloring be eliminated on Calendar for Mavericks? I'm running OS X 10.9.1 (Mavericks). The new calendar design has the weekends tinted gray.  Fine, I suppose, if you're a 9-5er, but I'm a musician and weekends are my weekdays.  Weeks aren't all the same, and any day can be a work day or a day off.\n\nDoes anyone know how to turn off the gray tint if I can't assign my weekends to match my actual schedule?\n\nA: No, this cannot be changed. \nIt is hard coded.\n\nA: I checked all of the preference values stored in com.apple.iCal.plist and there's nothing that affects what days are gray, so I don't think this is possible even with a hidden setting.\nA pragmatic approach might be to use a different calendar app to read the same data as Apple's calendar uses.

I have a video and would like to create what is called a Photo Montage like this: (combining several photos of the same skier like below)\n\nI have searched on the Internet and some definition of \"Montage\" is different from what's shown here.  I know some Android phone has this feature when taking a video.  But right now I already have a video and like to create this layered time lapse effect on either Mac OS X or iPhone/iOS.\n\nA: Cool idea! Here's how I'd do it using Final Cut Pro X (or Compressor 4). This won't help if you're looking for something automated. Combination is already been discussed in the comments, so I'll offer more detail on generating stills prior to combining them. \n1. How to extract still images from the video using Final Cut Pro X\nHere's how to get several stills from a video using Final Cut Pro X. My answer assumes you've imported the video file and added it to a project. \nFirst, add a destination.\nFinal Cut Pro X doesn't automatically offer you the option of exporting all the frames in a video project. You must \"activate\" this feature. Open Preferences and select the Destinations panel. Click \"Add destination\" and choose \"Image sequence\": Here's what Apple has to say about FCP X destinations.\nSecond, export or \"share\" the movie.\nClick the \"File\" menu, select \"Share\", and click \"Export Image Sequence\". In the modal export dialogue box, you can adjust file format under the \"Settings\" tab. I recommend defaulting to TIFF (a lossless format that won't add any compression artifacts).\n2. Select the images you want to combine.\nJudging from the example above, you're looking for images that are spaced evenly. Perhaps frames 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 will be the ones you need. Pay attention to the quality of each individual shot. If frame 15 is blurry, then try 14 or 16. This could be done using Preview, the Finder, iPhoto, Aperture, or your layer-friendly photo editing software of choice.\n3. Combine the images.\nAs I acknowledged above, I don't have anything to add to the comments already made. Use your layer-competent photo-editing software of choice. Depending on how much the camera moved while filming, you may need to stretch, blend, and rotate each layer.\nConsiderations\nConsideration 1: Interlaced video yields messy stills.\nIt has been a long time since I've worked with interlaced video, so I don't have much to say. Just know it's an issue with some video cameras, specifically when the resolution is \"i\" not \"p\" (e.g., 720i). For example, check out the image on the right: \n\nConsideration 2: Video frames have wayyy lower resolution than still photos.\nThe bottom line here is that frames extracted from a video will not give you nearly as much detail to work with as still photographs. The resulting \"montage\"/time lapse will be much lower resolution. (I recognize that the content in question has already been filmed, but for posterity I wanted to point this out.) Unless you're shooting with an incredibly high resolution video camera, like a 4k camera, the number of pixels in one frame of video is much smaller than the number of pixels in a still photograph. 1080p video, the highest resolution on DSLRs, is 1920 x 1080, or 1.98 megapixels. Contrast that to 18 megapixel stills on the same DSLR (e.g. Canon 60D). \nConsideration 3: The more the video camera moves, the more difficult it will be to combine your shots.\nSo use a tripod.\n", "Q: for what should I use fn key by default on mac book pro I have fn key in left bottom conner of my macbook pro keyboard. For what purpose does it exist? \nI understand that I can remap it to my needs, but what is its default function?\n\nA: It swaps the function of the function keys between the OS X function and the actual F1-F12 key. For example, pressing F1 normally will lower the brightness, but pressing fn+F1 will pass an actual F1. You can see these mappings by looking at the icon on the key itself.\nThis can be swapped in System Preferences → Keyboard so that fn+F1 will lower brightness and F1 will pass an actual F1.\n\nAlternatively you can swap it by running the following Terminal command, then logging out:\ndefaults write -g com.apple.keyboard.fnState -bool true\n\nAlso, fn+fn is used by default to start OS X Dictation.\n\nPerhaps the most common usage though, is using FN+Backspace to get a delete key.\n\nYou can learn this by using help from Finder (⌘?), search for \"fn\" and read the article titled \"Use keyboard function keys\"\n", "Q: How to find files by the filename length in OS X 10.9.1? Need to find files/folders with names longer than n characters (OS X 10.9.1).\nCould you please help?\n\nA: You can use the find command with the -regex (regular expression) option. This is probably less efficient than globbing, because -regex matches against the entire path.\nfind -E . \\( -type f -or -type d \\) -and -regex '.*/[^/]{11,}'\n\nPrecisely, this command does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*recursively searches for files in the current folder and in the subdirectories (you can limit the depth with an additional -maxdepth n clause);\n\n*uses the extended syntax (-E) for regexes.\n\n*searches for files and folders (-type f -or -type d)\n\n*regex match: the string which follows the last slash in the file path must be 11 characters or longer.\n\n\nA: The most basic way is probably to use globbing:\nfind . -type f -name '???????????*'\n\nThis will list all files with a filename length greater than 10 characters. There are 11 question marks, and the asterisk matches those with longer length. Modify the number of question marks to match what you're looking for.\nFor greater than or equal to 10, use ??????????*, or for equal to 10 use ??????????.\n\nA: You can also just filter the output of find:\nfind .|awk -F/ 'length($NF)>=11'\n\n-F sets IFS, NF is the number of fields, and $NF is the last field.\n", "Q: Exporting highlights from Kindle Personal Documents to a TXT file There are two main categories in Kindle App for iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Books - contains books purchased from Amazon; highlights are available at https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights — it works fine for me.\n\n*Personal Documents - contains all other books; highlights are not available online.\n\n\nSo, I have book purchased at different source than Amazon and I would like to be able to export my highlights and notes to a text file (or any other common format).

Having a Mail server running on Mac OS X 10.7.5 (Lion) and having \"Junk Mail Filtering\" enabled, causes greylisting to kick in on every received message. An example:\nDec 23 22:05:45 servername /usr/libexec/postfix/greylist.pl[89032]: Temporary message rejection to: <user@host.tld> from: <nobody@linux3.s12.com.br> sent from: [50.23.172.250] for: 60 seconds due to greylisting\n\nThat is nice for spam prevention, but not so nice for customers submitting orders through a PHP formmail at our web site. This causes a delay before order messages are being delivered to our mailbox. Our web site is being hosted by a third party web hosting firm.\nHow to exclude the messages sent via our web hosting firm from greylisting?\n\nA: As this is 10.7 Server, the 10.8 command:\n$ sudo serveradmin settings mail:postfix:add_whitelist_domain = \"yahoo.com\"\n\ncan't be used in this case.\n\n1. Create an exception file\n$ sudo touch /etc/postfix/sender_access\n\n2. Fill this file with domains that are OK to be excluded from the (greylist) policy\n$ echo 'mail-out.ovh.net OK' | sudo tee -a /etc/postfix/sender_access\n\n3. Create database from text file\n$ sudo postmap hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access\n\n4. Modify the Mac OS Lion SMTP server configuration\nThis configuration change allows the domains configured in the exception file to bypass running the greylist check. Therefore open up the main.cf, for example using the nano editor:\n$ sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf\n\nSearch for the line that starts with smtpd_recipient_restrictions =, for example using the key combination Ctrl + W\nThe line might look like:\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated permit_mynetworks reject_unauth_destination check_policy_service unix:private/policy permit\n\nFor readability I am writing this one line now as multiple lines:\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = \n    permit_sasl_authenticated \n    permit_mynetworks \n    reject_unauth_destination \n    check_policy_service unix:private/policy \n    permit\n\nAfter reject_unauth_destination and before check_policy_service unix:private/policy some new text has to be inserted. The new text tells the mail server to look in the newly created file. The magic words to insert are: check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access.\nNow the smtpd_recipient_restrictions looks like:\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = \n    permit_sasl_authenticated \n    permit_mynetworks \n    reject_unauth_destination \n    check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access \n    check_policy_service unix:private/policy \n    permit\n\nOr written as a single line, it looks like:\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated permit_mynetworks reject_unauth_destination check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access check_policy_service unix:private/policy permit\n\nTo save the change press Ctrl + O, and to exit the nano editor press Ctrl + X.\n5.

In the Terminal preferences, I'm able to configure the Terminal to \"Open shells with:\" -> \"Command (complete path):\" /opt/local/bin/bash.\nWhat options is the terminal passing when invoking this command?  Terminal appears to run each shell as a login shell, so I'm assuming --login is being passed?  \nIs there any Apple documentation that gives an overview of exactly what is being run when you open a terminal window?\n\nA: No arguments are passed. The terminal runs login -pfq $USER $PROGRAM, which in turn runs the specified program. login signals to the program that it is a login shell by prepending a - to argv[0] (the program name).\nFor the default shell, Terminal actually does something different. It invokes login -pfl $USER /bin/bash -c exec -la bash /bin/bash, where the -l option to login tells it not to run the command as login shell, while the -l option to exec tells it to run its argument as a login shell (by adding the dash). The reason while this is done is that login also sets the current directory to the user's home directory when it runs a program as a login shell, while exec doesn't. This allows the Terminal to open shells in the same current directory as the current tab, without login setting it back to the home directory.\n\nA: The command:\n/opt/local/bin/bash\n\nessentially instructs Terminal.app to load an interactive bash shell (the path for your example is likely the macports version). Initially when you open Terminal it starts a login shell session (in bash). Login shells can read files such as ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile that setup environment variables for your session, so what is being run is mostly indicative of what is configured within those files. \nIn general, by default when opening a bash shell from Terminal these things would be run:\nProcesses\nbash\nlogin\n\nOpen Files and Ports\n/bin/bash\n/usr/lib/dyld\n/private/var/db/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_x86_64\n/dev/ttys000 \n\nMore Information:\n\nOfficial Bash Website\nApple Man Page: bash(1)\n\n", "Q: Upgrade from Mountain Lion to Mavericks and my iMac got slower I imagine I am not the first one to notice this problem, but unfortunately the update of Mavericks so far have not even addressed this issue.\nI have a late 2011 iMac, and while the transition from Lion to Mountain Lion was smooth,  introduction of Mavericks made it gradually, not just too slow, but stack.\nShould I go back to Mountain Lion?\n\nA: That is a matter of personal choice.  \nIf your Mac is not running the way you expect and this is affecting your work and the use of your computer, I would go back to an OS which served your needs.\nOn the other hand you may want to persist and find out why your computer is running slowly. \nCertainly there are people out there who have issues with OS X 10.9 however I have it running on three different Macs without too many issues and I quite like it.\nFor the users of this forum to help you will need to provide more information about what slow means.

What does this mean? Thank you. \n\nA: If the notice were a pop up, then someone knows your Apple ID and password and entered them into another device.\nIf it's an email, you will want to check first that it's from Apple and perhaps log into http://appleid.apple.com to check that your account is secured, perhaps changing the password if you feel that is warranted. If you do this, make sure you also change the password to your email, as someone could use that to reset your Apple ID password.\nBasically, Apple wants to make sure you know every time you set up a new device with your Apple ID since if you didn't allow it, someone else will then have access to your messages, your apps, etc...\nWorst case, you can contact Apple Support if you can't resolve this as they might have better advice specific to your situation and be able to assist in locking / recovering control of your account. Also, if you use the same password here as you use on any other account - they could be compromised as well so you might want to change any account that uses your email and that password going forward.\n\nA: Your hotmail account may have been compromised (\"hacked\").\nOr this may just be a phishing attempt to reveal your password or go to a particular site which may then infect your computer.\nIf I was in your situation, I would check the legitimacy of the mail first (google it), then I would change my password on my hotmail account.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Finder filter image by orientation How can I filter images by orientation in Finder to show only portrait/vertical images or only landscape/horizontal images?\n\nA: From https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3481136:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for images by pressing Command + F\n\n\n*Add a search attribute\n\n\n*Pick the \"Orientation\" attribute\n\n\n*Set \"equals\" to \n\n\n*\n\n*0 if you want landscape/horizontal, \n\n*1 if you want portrait/vertical\n\n\nA: On OS X El Capitan, to bring up the search screen I use the key combination Command F, instead of CTRL F.\n", "Q: Store more apps on iPhone 5c 16gb So I recently moved from an Android phone to an iPhone 5c. One of my favorite features of Android was the ability to store apps on the SD card. It's apparent that there's no solution like this for an iPhone, as iPhones don't have an SD card slot. My question, however, is what alternatives may exist to storing extra apps on my 5c. I've come to find out that apps alone are filling my device. Using iCloud, I can sync just about everything else wirelessly, but regardless, I still could use some more breathing room just for my apps. Is there any sort of cloud based solution for this, or anything else for that matter? I've hunted around but can't seem to find any definitive answers.\n\nA: About the only option is to have all the apps you want on iTunes and load them onto your iPhone as desired. Of course you can't have them all at the same time because of your memory limitations but you could change sets for vacation or work for instance. \nOr you can buy an iPhone with more memory.\nThose are the only options Apple leaves you.\nHappy Day!\n\nA: iOS does not have the concept of a file system for users to access in the first place. Even if you use a dock to USB / camera card adapter, the OS will read files from th storage and ingest them into the photo app. \nShort of a jailbreak, you will not be able to extend the storage in an analogous manner to Android, OS X, Windows of other computer-like OS. \n", "Q: Applescript for moving recently added files (not created or modified) to another folder?

My PC does not detect it, and I've tried multiple PCs and USB ports. Resetting does not fix the issue.\nWhat do I do?\n\nA: here's how I solved the 5-second-light-no-charge issue.\nYou will need some patience though.\nPlug your 4th Gen Shuffle into a high-power USB port (preferable the stock wall charger). Wait until the red light goes on and than off. Unplug. Repeat continuously until the light doesn't go off, which means the Shuffle starts charging. It took me about 15 minutes, however it may take longer depending on how low the battery charge is.\nHere's a little technical background behind this process. When the device is not being used for a while, especially if it is not charged, the battery voltage falls below a certain threshold becoming insufficient to start the microprocessor any more. However, the processor is necessary to start the charging process, and the device gets into the deadlock. Basically, when you plug it in, it's being charged for only 5 seconds while the red light is on. When you constantly plug it in and out you manually charge the battery in 5-second increments until it's voltage is high enough  to start the processor.\nI advise to unplug the USB from the charger, not the charger from the socket.\n\nA: If you've tried resetting it as per these instructions from Apple and it still doesn't work, it probably means that the battery is dead. This would be my guess since red light means that the iPod isn't charing:\n\nIf a red light is blinking or continuously on, your iPod battery may not be charged.[...]\n\n— http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1412\nYou should of course, to be extra sure, try charging it with a dedicated charger, that is one that you plug into a socket (instead of the USB port on your computer) to make sure that it's not just a case of the iPod needing more power than an USB port can provide.\n", "Q: iOS 7 Jailbreak, iPhone 5S question So I have the 5S and the iOS 7 Jailbreak came out the other day.

And Caps Lock starts work as forward delete key.\n\nBut I need to set fn to Caps Lock key.\nUPDATE\nI have noticed in KeyRemap4MacBook EventViewer: when I press Caps Lock...\n\n... I get control_l keycode. But in fact it don't work even as control_l (I checked).\nWhy it shows control_l? Maybe because I have changed fn key to left control in KeyRemap4MacBook app.\n\nWhen I uncheck this checkbox and watch in EventViewer on Caps Lock clicking again: I see Fn code on output.\n\nBut in fact it does not work as Fn (I check it on fn+delete)\nUpdate 2\nI disabled CAPS LOCK\n\nIn PCKeyboardHack set F19 to Caps Lock\n\nIn KeyRemap4MacBook remap F19 to fn\n<item>\n    <name>f19_to_fn</name>\n    <identifier>f19_to_fn</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F19, KeyCode::FN</autogen>\n</item>\n\n\nAnd now Caps Lock works as fn except f1 - f12 keys.

If you go to the purchases tap you should see that it restarted.\n\nA: I have encountered this issue a couple of times, lastly while trying to install Microsoft Word from the Apple Mac Store. The following steps solved the problem for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the Apple Mac Store COMPLETELY.\n\n*Wipe the contents of the App Store cache folders. To do so, enter the following in your command line:\n\n\nsudo rm -R $TMPDIR../C/com.apple.appstore/*  \nsudo rm -R ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore/*  \nsudo rm -R /Library/Updates/*  \n\n\n\n*Kill all the processes shown in the Activity Monitor being listed when searching for ‘store’:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Delete you App Store Preferences and Cookies:\n\n\nsudo rm -R ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.appstore.plist  \nsudo rm -R ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.storeagent.plist  \nsudo rm -R ~/Library/Cookies/com.apple.appstore.binarycookies  \n\nAnd that's it, just start your App Store normally, and retry to install your app.\nP.D.: A reboot may be needed\nP.D.: Don't freak out if the RMs say these files/folders do NOT exist and therefore they can't be deleted, you just are where you wanted to be already\nP.D.: I know, I know, some of these commands do not need SUDO rights, but it doesn't hurt to using them either\n", "Q: How do I download Remote.app on an iOS 6 only device?

Whenever I turn on my laptop, it boots up (apple logo and spinning wheel appears), and then goes into a loop of blue screens. I think the problem has something to do with the login process, because I sometimes see mouse and the brightness and sound icons appear, but it always fades away.  \nI tried doing  fsck (command s), but the same problem's there. Safe mode also doesn't seem to work, unless I do verbose mode, but then again, it loops after the apple logo (grey screen). The recovery mode (cmd r) doesn't work at all. I tried pressing the option key but all i see is one disk, and that one still leads to series of loops. I also tried running the disk utility from my bootable usb but I don't know how to boot it. I tried pressing c and also tried the doing the option key thing. They both don't work, the usb doesn't appear at all. I tried resetting my pRAM, that doesn't help either. HELP! I just know that something is wrong with the disk, but I cant fix it because I can't go to recovery mode.   \n\nA: Blue screen is indicating a user level problem loading your specific settings.\nYou can overcome this in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot in safe mode and log in and make a new admin account - set that new account to auto-log in or disable auto log in.\n\n*boot in single user mode, run fsck as directed, then mount the filesystem and delete /var/db/.AppleSetupDone and type exit\nAt that point, you can let the setup assistant create a new temporary admin (and temp_admin might be a good user name to choose to avoid matching an existing user name) so you can look at the system logs and clean up whatever user preference or program is interrupting the boot cycle.\nIf as you mentioned, you really can't boot at all off that drive, then you have bigger problems and need to bring a new OS on an external drive (or perhaps SD card) to the mix or seek help from someone that can back up your files or assist in reinstalling the OS from an external source.\n\nA: Kudos for trying — and listing — all those steps in your question.\nLike you say, it's probably a disk problem. Whether it's software- or hardware-related remains to be seen.\nI'd suggest trying to boot from the Snow Leopard install disc (the physical DVD). This should allow you to access the busted internal HDD (Through Terminal or Disk Utility). However, as you're probably aware, if you're not able to access the HDD even while running from the install disc, it'd probably suggest that it's a hardware problem.\n", "Q: Change Airport signal strength I want to change the WiFi signal strength of my Airport base.

The file in question is Apple80211 in\n  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A.\n  Replacing this file with the older version allows AirPort Utility\n  v5.6.1 to be run under 10.9, but only via Terminal (i.e.,\n  double-clicking it will not launch it, it will throw an error).\nHowever, there is a way to get around this issue by importing the older library into AirPort Utility v5.6.1 before running it. That is\n  what the new solution, downloadable, infra, does.\n\n\nA: You could install Mountain Lion in a VM (both VMWare and Parallels will do) and run APU 5.6.1 from there. I'm using this to still be able to switch between Aiport Profiles (which also are gone in APU 6.x).\n\nA: Apple still has the link:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1536\nUsing third-party vendors for downloading this I would not recommend. \n", "Q: Install a clean Mavericks and then use TimeMachine makes it unclean again? I am about to install OSX Mavericks in an iMac I have.\nI would love to make a clean install (creating the bootable USB with that complex procedure).\nI was thinking about copying folder by folder but thinking about iTunes, iMovie and iPhoto makes things more complicate as they are stored in the library folder and it can carry more than one problem I guess.\nI was wondering if that \"clean\" install will again become \"dirty\" if I restore everything with the copy I have in TimeMachine. \nWould that also transfer preferences and things which could interfere with the new installation?\n\nA: It depends on your definition of 'dirty' — indeed, restoring from Time Machine will restore many preferences, but won't restore any system files, as they will come from your fresh OS X install.\n\nIf you want the cleanest possible OS, manually copying the files you need will be the best option — even though it's time consuming, you'll only get what you need.\nThe OS itself will remain 'clean' if you restore from Time Machine since the files will be kept from the OS X install and won't be restored from Time Machine.\n", "Q: Getting Kernel Panics on a fresh Mavericks installation; Can anyone help analyzing the KP logs? Since a couple of weeks, my MacBook Pro has been experiencing random kernel panics. I believe these kps started after installing Mavericks (although I am not completely sure). I decided to do a complete fresh install of Mavericks, without restoring it using TimeMachine. All went well for a while, until last week, in which I had two KPs again.\nThe crashes seem completely random and are pretty rare. I think I had a little less than 10 KPs in two months time. So the fact that all went well for a while lately doesn't mean much I think; probably pure coincidence... I have a MacBook Pro late 2010 15 inch, 2.53 GHz Intel Core i5 and I run OS X 10.9.1. The kp logs always report about a GPU panic in the beginning. \nI have quite some stuff running on my mac, including stuff that interacts pretty directly with the core of the OS. This includes NoSleep (which is practically never running, but I know it installs some kexts which I can imagine being loaded even if the actual NoSleep program itself is not running), Tuxera NTFS, RightZoom, TotalFinder, Parallels 8 and iStat Menus. All run on the latest updates. Maybe I should make the upgrade to Parallels 9, as it is currently my main suspect. I have been running a lot of VMs lately, and it is very well possibly that it had been running every time a kp occured. However, I rather not make the paid upgrade as I am Dutch ;)\nCould anyone help analyze the KP logs? I am clueless...\nI posted the last two here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://pastebin.com/3CsCHRsg (KP log 24-dec-2013) \n\n*http://pastebin.com/jVmEQsJG (KP log 20-dec-2013)\n\n\nA: Your particular MacBook Pro (6,2) has documented GPU problems for some units:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/TS4088\nhttp://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57577329-263/os-x-10.8.3-forces-discrete-gpu-use-in-2010-macbook-pros/\nEven if you think you are out of warranty coverage, a call to Apple would be a good move. You've done most of the troubleshooting by cleanly installing Mavericks and still see the panics. Also the first line with details sure points at persistent GPU code involvement in the panics:\n panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff7f9d838fac): \"GPU Panic: [<None>] 3 3 7f 0 0 0 0 3 : NVRM[0/1:0:0]: Read Error 0x00000100: CFG 0x0a2910de 0x00100000 0x00000000, BAR0 0xd2000000 0xffffff812f8cc000 0x0a5480a2, D0, P3/4\\n\"@/SourceCache/AppleGraphicsControl/AppleGraphicsControl-3.4.12/src/AppleMuxControl/kext/GPUPanic.cpp:127\n\nYou could also run sysdiagnose and file a bug report with Apple in case this is software instead of hardware - these repeated panic logs would give the engineers a good idea exactly where the code is getting nonsense values from the hardware and perhaps decide to handle it less harshly as far as the user is concerned.\n\nA: My mid 2010 15 inch Mac Book Pro is in for a logic board replacement right now for what looks like the same issue. At least the first line of the log you posted is identical to the ones I was having. Apparently a run of nVidia graphics chips used in that vintage of 15 inch MBPs had a \"latent defect\". The bug can be tickled or not depending on the applications you are running and also the OS revision -- different releases of OS/X use the graphics hardware in different ways. My panics really got bad after upgrading to Mavericks, like yours -- though I had a few, very few and far between (<< 10 in all) before the upgrade.\nWhen you take it in to Apple, be sure that they run what is called the VST test. The Apple stores do NOT run this test routinely even though it only takes a few minutes. Even after telling the Genius who took my machine in that I wanted this test run, and even after the test appearing on the work order, they did not run it until I insisted over the phone (their recommendation was to wipe the disk clean and do a fresh OS install). This was after they had run every other diagnostic on it for two days and pronounced the panics software related. Of course, it failed the VST test, and as I said, is now having the logic board replaced.\nBTW this is the TS4088 issue, and although you should be within the 3-year window or just barely out of it, many Apple stores will still pick up the tab for this since it is a known problem.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Blur Interfaces of TeXworks on MacBook Pro with Retina Display？ I am using TeXworks as the LaTeX editor on my new MacBook Pro with Retina Display.\nThe interfaces are super blur.

Normally it just requires a password to login, no username is required.\nMy issue is that when I use my iPhone 5 (iOS 7.0.4) to connect to that wifi, it always asks for both username and password. I tried leaving the \"username\" field blank and fill in the \"password\" field only, but it says \"Unable to connect to...\".\nThis issue happens only on my iPhone and doesn't happen on any other devices such as Macbook, iMac or iPad.\n\nA: The problem is that iOS is detecting your network as an Enterprise network that requires username and password. \nThe work-around:\nManually enter the network type into iOS. To do this with iOS 7.1:\nSettings / Wi-Fi / Choose a network, and select \"Other\".\nPut in the name (SSID) as it is advertised on the previous screen.\nUnder Security, choose WPA2 or WPA (try both). Do not choose the \"Enterprise\" network. Enter the password.\nMy experience is you have to try 3 or 4 times before it works; don't know why, maybe fat fingers.\n\nA: Change the router settings to only allow WPA.  It is most likely set to Automatic which can choose WPA or WPA2.\n", "Q: Background App Refresh not updating apps Background App Refresh won't auto update apps — why not?\niPad 2, 64 GB, iOS 7\n\nA: Background App Refresh won't update apps.\n\nWhen Background App Refresh is on, apps that take advantage of this feature can refresh themselves in the background.\n\nSource: Apple KB Article — iOS: Understanding multitasking\nThis means that the apps can refresh their content, but Background App Refresh is not responsible for the actual updating of the binary from the App Store.\n\nWith regards to the actual app updating, there is a criteria which must be met before an app can be updated:\n\nIntelligently scheduled updates.\niOS schedules updates during power-efficient times.

I have some wireless networks that I joined on my iOS device and I now want to retrieve the passwords from the device.\nThese are stored in the keychain presumably so I’d like (by hook or crook if necessary) to get into the iOS / iPadOS keychain and obtain saved passwords or secrets. \nI'm primarily interested in old hotspot passwords, but being able to list other items in the iOS keychain would be generally useful. If I need to use a computer, that's fine, but I would also be interested in ways to accomplish this from iOS itself if that is possible.\nIs the keychain exportable forensically or natively on modern iOS devices with a physical Secure Enclave?\n\nA: There is a jailbreak application called WiFi Passwords. It's free by Malcolm Hall in the BigBoss Cydia repository. It allows you to view all of the passwords for the networks that you've joined (including usernames for WPA2 Enterprise networks).\n\nA: One trivial solution is to enable keychain sync for iOS 7 and have the keychain contents sent to iCloud.\nThen, on a Mac, enable keychain syncing in the iCloud preference pane in system preferences and use Keychain Utility to inspect the iCloud keychain.\n\nOnce above step is completed. Open Keychains on Mac and look for iCloud on the right panel. You should then see all the SSID you have ever saved on your various devices and computers synced through iCloud. \n", "Q: AppleScript counts multiple Mail messages In this AppleScript on Mavericks:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    activate\n    set viewer to the first message viewer\n    set msgList to selected messages of viewer\nend tell\n\nset msgCount to 0\nrepeat with m from 1 to the count of msgList\n    set msgCount to msgCount + 1\nend repeat\n\nI get a much higher message count than the number of selected messages (it can be a difference of almost 30% for some mailboxes). I have confirmed that selecting ONE message with no replies can result in the message being counted more than once. This is with a standard IMAP account.\nIs there any reason other than IMAP errors for this discrepancy?\n\nA: I've seen this too, and I presume it's because Mail in Mavericks plays badly with IMAP in various ways, and AppleScript aggravates these issues. For example, some people are finding that if you move a message from one IMAP mailbox to another using AppleScript, it can take 30 seconds or even a minute - but if you do the same thing just by dragging the message, it's very fast.\nSo, to sum up, my answer is: yes, it's real; yes, it's a bug, and no, you're not going to be able to do anything about it. Mail is doing some kind of caching here. Quitting and relaunching Mail might (or might not) clear up the problem temporarily. But it might not.\nI tried getting the Mail selection with AppleScript just now and I got four messages when only two were selected. But close examination showed that this was only two distinct messages; Mail has wrongly assigned to two different unique message ids to each message. That's a massive bug, and there's nothing you can do about it. (I tried rebuilding the mailbox but it didn't help.)\nEDIT: I played around with this some more: I turned off View -> Organize By Conversation and I then rebuilt the mailbox, and that seems to have helped.\n", "Q: Is it possible to update from 6.0.1 to 6.1.3 instead of 7.0.4?

I would like to upgrade to iOS 6.1.3 (afaik latest 6.x for iPhone 4s?) and not to 7.x as software updater suggests.\nIs there any way to do so?\n\nA: In iTunes, on the Summary tab for your device, hold Shift, then click the Update button. This will allow you to manually specify an IPSW file to update your device with.\nAs for obtaining said IPSW file, there are various links around the web to get the version you want.

Unfortunately, unlike iOS, OSX can't limit application network usage based on whether it's on a cell network, and I always have to remember to close Steam, uTorrent, Dropbox, automatic updates, etc. whenever I start tethering. Is there an app out there that I can turn on and off quickly to whitelist a small number of applications and prevent everything else from using the network?\n\nA: It looks like Little Snitch allows you to configure whitelists, blacklists, and even more advanced configurations for network access. You can make a cellular profile and switch to it when you use your tethering. It also measures how much bandwidth you've used, per app and total. You can even automatically switch profiles when you connect to your tethered Wi-Fi or Bluetooth network.\n\nA: TripMode was made specifically for this purpose, and even turns on automatically when connected to designated cell hotspots.\n\nA: LuLu is the best choice, nowadays.\n\n\n*\n\n*It's given for free and it doesn't force you to pay for it (but it's worth spending a dollar or two on Patreon, as gratitude).\n\n*It's open-source.\n\n*Has a simple GUI.\n\n*Allows to blocks the outgoing connections (for the incoming is better to use Apple firewall or something else)\n\n*Allows to choose the apps that should be allowed or blocked\nIt's really great.\nIMHO the only feature missing is that it lacks a passive mode that \"blocks all by default\". That would be especially useful when tethering or using a limited-traffic hotspot; but it just 5 minutes to block everything (except few system daemons) and then allow just the apps that should have internet access.\n", "Q: Transferring Clash of Clans I originally started playing Clash of Clans on a first-generation iPad and connected it to my GameCenter.\nI then got a third generation iPad, linked it to the first iPad's GameCenter account, and continued playing Clash of Clans on the new iPad 3.\nMy friend is giving me his GameCenter account, which is linked to HIS Clash of Clans village- is there any way I can transfer his village to my Game Center ?\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*sign into your our Game Center on your iPad 3\n\n*delete the app from the original iPad (making a backup first)\n\n*sign into your friend's Game Center on your iPad \n\n*reload the game and verify the correct village loaded\n\n\nOnce that is done, you should have both villages intact.\n\nA: You will only lose that village from the device, on your iPad 3 everything will be fine.\nJush log out in the game and from gamecenter and then let him log in.\n", "Q: download Mavericks at app store, can i install? I have downloaded Mavericks from the App Store. Now I have the installation image, but I am afraid to install it because it might delete my files and programs under Mac OS X Lion 10.8.4. If I install Mavericks, will it all be deleted?\n\nA: No it won't delete your personal files or programs you have installed on Lion. The installer will upgrade your Lion installation to Mavericks and will keep your existing programs by default.\nHowever, it is always a good idea to create a backup before upgrading your system. Just in case somethings happens during the installation or in case some of your software is not compatible with Mavericks. The backup will allow you to revert backup to Lion. I suggest you use TimeMachine with an external hard-drive to create a backup of your entire system before upgrading it.\nMacworld has also written a great guide about what you need to know before upgrading to Mavericks.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 shuts down at 25% on iOS 7.0.4 My iPhone 5 has been shutting down earlier than normal at lower battery levels. \nFirst, it started to shut down around 10%, then it increased to 15%, 20%, and finally 25%.

I did that, activated it and everything went OK, update is now here.\nI’m interested if these types of situations are common and are not something to worry about. From my previous experiences, App Store is kind of wonky so this behavior is not unexpected, but I see this first time and I’m little concerned.\n\nA: If you get it working just by redownloading, it's nothing to worry about. \nAs both a user and developer I can tell that these types of errors aren't uncommon (Often times caused by an unstable internet connection or if the Mac has been on standby for a longer period whereafter the download is continued). But it's decided by multiple factors including your router, signal strength, geographical location and so on.\nThe problem is that it can be hard to perfectly download every little piece of a large file. Sometimes it's read wrong or written wrong to the disk and this causes corruption and possibly confuses the part of App Store that displays progress and download items.\nTo Apple's credit, though, they seem to be able to \"chunk\" download effectively most of the time, where other apps (like Chrome for instance) just kills the download and makes you manually start over. \nPersonally, I rarely have these types of errors anymore (they were much more common in the \"early days\" of the App Store).\n", "Q: Will a deactivated iPhone still receive iMessages and emails?

I have apparently had Java installed at some point and Mavericks removed it, which is fine by me. The problem is that some unknown app is constantly trying to run Java, causing this dialog to appear every few minutes:\n\nHow do I find out what app is causing this? I know it's not a website, as no browser needs to be running in order for the dialog to pop up.\n\nA: Since your screenshot references java where the app name usually is written, it suggests that it's the command-line version of Java that a given app is trying to run.\nIf it appears at specific intervals, it either an app that you have open or a periodical job running automatically in the background (Which, ironically, could be the Java Updater itself).\nA quick way to check out which of your installed applications use Java is to run this command in Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app):\nfind /Applications -type f -name *.jar\n\nThis isn't 100 % accurate but it can give you a rough idea. Dreamweaver and Flash from Adobe, for instance, uses Java.\nTo get a list of currently running automated background scripts use this command in Terminal — You should run in as close as possible to the moment when the Java popup appears:\nlaunchctl list\n\n(Credit to this thread on Apple Support, it's also useful in understanding launchd)\nThis will, sadly, only give you a list of processes running and not why or what they're running.\nFinally, you might want to take a look at the files in ~/Library/LaunchAgents (In Finder use Cmd+Shift+G and paste in the path. This directory shows the periodical jobs that you've setup as a user (sometimes indirectly through an install). Maybe one of these use Java.\n", "Q: Are there any reasons to turn off MacBook Pro instead of just sleeping it? I do not completely turn off my MacBook Pro and I only sleep it.\nAre there any limitations to consider when doing this for several months in a row?\n\nA: There's actually some validity to “Have you tried turning it off and on again?”.\nExtremely simply put: Over the course of being on, the OS accumulates a lot of “leftovers” from all of the processes that've been running (Automatic garbage collection isn't perfect). When the system is restarted cache is purged and only needed processes are started. Sometimes processes that run for a very long time can use more memory and even — at times — stop working. Also, it's not all apps that clean up properly after themselves which can lead to unused processes taking up memory and/or CPU cycles.\nOS X handles this excellently (compared to Windows) but I think it's impossible to create an OS that is entirely immune to the \"littering\" of a system that is often used over extensive periods of time.\nNote: This is just my experience from 10+ years working with computers. I probably can't give a scientifically correct explanation :) \n\nA: I almost never turn off my (Mid 2013) MacBook Pro and can't remember any issues. In fact the only time I restart it is when an installation requires it.\nIt's probably not a bad idea to have a password on wake but that would be a personal choice rather than a hard and fast rule.\n\nA: I think what you loose is security, or you at least make your pc more vulnerable while it does not necessary needs to be. If you turn off your mac, it is turned off, and no services are(or shouldn't be - correct me if I am wrong)running in background as konqui said in the post up. Turning off your wifi, or taking off internet cable should solve this problem. \nOther think you loose is a bit of performance, because you have lots of other things you maybe started before and not necessary need now. After restart, your ram is free from leftovers from other apps, and swapping. And you can read here lots of complaints from people that their ram is not freeing the memory as it should be, and their macs are a bit slower. \nWhat you gain is a bit time, which you loose for booting up your mac, and starting apps to your desirable state. Which I expect it was in before you would restart or turn it off. \nPersonally, I don't think there is any problem in putting it to sleep only. Critical updates from apple will make you restart your mac from time to time. And if there was a problem, there would be significant complaints from apple community. \n", "Q: How to import iPhone videos into Instagram without distortion? Whenever I take a video with the standard camera app and then import it into Instagram on my iPhone 5S, the video ends up distorted.\nA still from the original video:\n\nA screengrab showing distortion:\n\nI suspect this occurs due to the different aspect ratios of the two formats. \nIs there any way to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take video in the default camera app in Instagram's 1:1 ratio, or\n\n*Crop video in the Instagram app so that it doesn't distort\n\n\nA: I know that Instagram doesn't allow video cropping at the moment. Nor can you change the Camera app's aspect ratio. I suggest either recording inside Instagram or changing your phone's recording position to landscape.\n\nA: In case someone still has this problem, I found a way to avoid the distortion on videos caused by Instagram. Instead of opening the instagram app and selecting your video in the app, go to your phone gallery and click on the \"Share\" button, share to instagram and the distortion goes away! Worked this way for me!\nPS: Android user... might work for Iphones as well!\n", "Q: How to fix \"Error: -5341: MediaKit reports partition (map) too small\" after upgrading to a larger hard disk? I recently bought a new SSD drive, as my stored data amounts outgrew the old one a little bit. After copying all data using dd if=/dev/disk0 of=/dev/disk1, I want to enlarge my system partition, but Disk Utility is failing silently and diskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 R (first partition is the EFI boot volume), I receive following error message:\n\nError: -5341: MediaKit reports partition (map) too small\n\nHow can I resize my system volume?\n\nA: Your partition table does not know about the larger hard drive yet. While Disk Utility also queries the hard disk size and lets you request it to enlarge your partition, it will fail when finally changing the partition size (after doing a file system check).\nThis can be solved on different ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*One is to destroy the GPT (partition table) and recreate it manually, which is a rather annoying and error-prone way of fixing the problem as it's easy to mess up when adding your partitions again.\n\n*An easier, better way is to run gparted, which is also included in current Ubuntu Desktop Live images (or is easy to install from their packages repositories) and probably lots of other Linux disks. After starting it, it will recognize the wrong disk size in your partition table and ask whether it should fix it for you. After fixing the table, reboot to OS X and finally enlarge the Volume.\n\nA: I erased the drive and selected the scheme as GUID partition, tried setting up the partitions I wanted, hit apply and it worked. Then I erased the drive again, selected Apply Partition map (which was previously giving the \"Mediakit / space too small\" error), tried setting up my partitions, hit apply and... drum-roll. It worked that time!?  Hope that helps someone else too.\n\nA: I agree with Jens Erat for method 1.\nFor a detailed tutorial, read this topic: INCREASE DISK AND PARTITION SIZE IN OS X\nMake sure that you understand what you are doing, take the time to write down the output of \"gpt show dev/diskN\" on a sheet of paper and double check it.\nBe careful that if there is a hidden recovery partition after the \"Macintosh HD\" one for instance, increasing the size of this partition would overwrite the recovery partition.\nI also suggest that you read the comments after the tutorial.\nI did not test the lastest versions of GParted, so I cannot confirm if method 2 by Jens Erat works or not, but I assume so.\n", "Q: How can I bypass Activation Lock? I bought a used iPhone 4.  The previous owner re-set the phone, but did not remove the device from their iCloud.  It is asking me for their iCloud information when I try to set-up the phone.  I don't have contact with the previous owner anymore.  Is there a way to remove the device from their iCloud so I can use a new one?\n\nA: Official steps to turn off Find My iPhone Activation Lock are documented by Apple at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201441\n\nIn a nutshell, the various ways to remove iCloud Activation Lock include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple will remove the lock if they can verify the original purchaser is requesting the action.\n\n*Self-service removal if you can authenticate as the iCloud account that placed the lock on that device.\n\n*Business using DEP can often use their MDM to remove the lock as a self-service action without needing Apple to be involved.\n\n\nFor consumers, you will likely need to make an appointment at an Apple Store and provide the Genius on-hand proof of purchase (to show you're the authorized owner) along with proof of identity and they will reset Activation Lock, giving you access to the device.\nFor businesses, it depends if you are enrolled in DEP - Apple's Device Enrollment Program or just want to provide copies of the original purchase listing serial numbers to verify ownership.\nIf you bought the device second hand, stole it, found it or came to possess the device by some means other than buying it from Apple directly, then you will probably need the original owner to show proof of purchase, etc. They will then transfer the device to your account or simply disable Activation Lock.\nThe only self-service way to remove the lock if you can't type your password into the device itself is to authenticate at https://icloud.com and remove the activation lock when the device is not connected to the internet.\n\nA: Yes, but with some limitations\nCheckm8 Software, while awkwardly named, is able to bypass the Activation Lock Screen by exploiting its namesake vulnerability. Note that the software can only temporary bypass the activation lock and thus provide one-time access to the system. You need to follow the developers' how-to guide, which requires you to run the software between Step 3 and 4, to get a permanent (persists between reboots) bypass.\nThe limitations are, citing their own words:\n\nUnfortunately, deleting Setup.app will force your device to get the\n  baseband activation status to UNACTIVATED so the following services\n  won’t work on your device:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*No SIM signal (no service issue)\n  \n*No iMessage\n  \n*No Facetime\n  \n*Not able to add new iCloud account\n  \n*Not able to use with iTunes (it will show device activation screen in iTunes)\n  \n\nHonestly, I didn't expect it to work, so I was amazed after successfully bypassed the activation lock on my iPhone 5s running iOS 12.4.4.\n\nA: You cannot do anything technically to get past it. Your only method is to get back to the seller. If they have disappeared, then perhaps you might want to entertain the possibility that you have been sold a stolen iPhone.\nIn this instance, then rather than have a very expensive paperweight, you might want to report it to the Police. There is a slim chance that it has been reported as stolen, and they may be able to reunite it with it's true owner, in which case there is also a chance that they may reward you in some way to make up for your loss, or (perfect scenario) they will have already replaced it on insurance, and will simply unlock it for you and let you keep it.\nTo confirm, there is only a human solution to this problem, by getting the owner of the registered Apple ID to unlock it.\n\nA: You can't just bypass it.\nThe very nature of Activation Lock is that it is impassible so that the device can still be tracked by the owner if it is lost/stolen. You can't bypass it — the only way to remove it is by deleting the device from Find my iPhone on iCloud.com or logging in using the Apple ID that was used to set up Find my iPhone.\nYou can read more about bypassing (or not) Activation Lock in the following question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How secure is Activation Lock on iOS 7 (and later)?\n\nA: You can use this method to bypass the iCloud activation (it works only for iPhone 4) http://www.unlockboot.com/2014/03/bypass-ios-71-activation-lock-jailbreak.html\n", "Q: How can I remove unchecked and deleted songs in iTunes from my iPhone? Music which I've deleted from library and/or unchecked still appears on iPhone 4 and plays with checked music even after syncing.  How can I delete music from iPhone so it does not play any more?\n\nA: In iTunes, you can select the music to sync by track, playlist, artist, album, genre.\nIn order to delete a track from the iPhone, it shouldn't match any of the aforementioned criteria. Maybe the tracks are included in some smart playlist which is synced (Recent?).\n", "Q: How can I disable unused Services in Mavericks? I'm talking about the services you find when right-clicking a file or folder.\nIt should be possible to 'remove' those services within the system preferences (under the keyboard section) but this just won't work for me. When I uncheck the services nothing happens and as soon as I reopen the system preferences window it's all back to default.\nMaybe it's related to iCloud syncing (you know, those things Apple has yes to tell us about), but this is just a guess, nothing I know of.\n\nA: Trash the preference file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ServicesMenu.Services.plist, logout, login and try again with System Preferences. You may need to reveal the ~/Library folder.\n\nA: I assume that you’re talking about the services added by third-party apps. You can do it easily by downloading Services Manager and turn off all the services you’re not using.\n\nThere are two options you may choose. Turning off context menu simply remove the services when you use secondary click on the files, images, or text, however, you can still run it from the  menu in menu bar.\n\n", "Q: Limit the scope of tag search in Finder on Mavericks I have a fairly extensive file system with a large collection of images and a duplicate disc of those images and, additionally, some folders with images that are in process of some workflow. \nI have tagged some of these files. If I click a tag in the Finder's sidebar, ALL the files with that tag are shown throughout the file system. \nIs there a way to limit the search by tag to a certain folder (and it's contained folders) in the Finder?  \nHere is what I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder -> Preferences -> Advanced does not limit the scope when tags are used.\n\n*If click a tag and then try and add limiting information in the search box, the tag is lost.\n\n*If I click to the parent folder, then type tag:Red in the search folder, the files with that specific tag are not shown\nI can use mdfind at the command line, but that does not give a Finder window with the results. \n\nA: You can't get there from the tag view accessed from the sidebar, but if you navigate to the directory you want to search, and type the tag you're looking for, it will find files in that directory.\n\n\n", "Q: Copying start volume contents with SuperDuper without copying filesystem I have a MacBook Air with one SSD that unfortunately is formatted as journaled, case-sensitive.\nI have an external HDD that I copied my whole start volume bootable to with the tool SuperDuper and it works fine.\nWhen I format the SSD to the correct filesystem (journaled, not case-sensitive) it successfully formats it, but when I copy the data back with SuperDuper it transfers the old file system, too, rendering it useless.\nHow can I have the SSD with the system on it and the new filesystem?\n\nA: If you are familiar at all with Terminal you could try reading up on rsync and using that to copy stuff selectively over from your backup drive.\n", "Q: Completion for git commands I recently switched from using an Ubuntu box for the last 7 years to a Mac. I have read other posts like Switching from Ubuntu to OS X and I'm lost and What is the difference between iTerm2 and Terminal?\nWhy don't iTerm2 and Terminal complete the arguments for a command?\nEg. If I do gi+Tab, it autocompletes this word to git which is good. When I add a space and try remo+Tab, why don't I get it autocompleted to remote like in Ubuntu. I have to type everything manually after the word git. Same for other commands.\nAm I doing something wrong, or missing something?\n(Please note that I am not talking about the cmd + ; shortcut which autocompletes previously typed entries in iTerm2.) \n\nA: I have two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*use fish, it's really simple and easy\na. extend it by using oh-my-fish\n\n*zsh with oh-my-zsh. zsh is already installed so you don't need to do much.\na. chsh -s /bin/zsh\nb. logout and login again\nc. execute this to install oh-my-zsh wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh more info here: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\nI use oh-my-zsh but fish is great as well.\n\nA: This somewhat sidesteps the problem, in case someone wants to keep the Apple-provided version of Git on their system.\nYou can create aliases in the .gitconfig file in your home directory for shorter git commands. For example, I have git set up so git st runs git status instead.\nExample aliases in .gitconfig:\n[alias]\n    co = checkout\n    ci = commit\n    st = status\n    br = branch\n\n\nA: One option that might help is to use .git-completion.bash for bash git autocompletion.\nIt lets you type git commands and then have autocomplete for the remote name (e.g. 'origin' or 'heroku') and then (and more significantly) for the repository branch names.\nSee https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/55886/24565\nYour download the file from\nhttps://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash\n\nA: For those looking for a command completion solution for bash that's as easy to use as zsh + oh-my-zsh, there's now the bash-it project. Which, in its own words, is \"a shameless ripoff of oh-my-zsh\" -- nothing wrong with that really!\nIt sets up a plugin like architecture like oh-my-zsh does, where you can bring things in and out of your environment easily and get new things via sync'ing to their github project.\nInstallation needs three steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check a clone of this repo: git clone https://github.com/revans/bash-it.git ~/.bash_it\n\n*Run ~/.bash_it/install.sh (it automatically backs up your ~/.bash_profile)\n\n*Edit your ~/.bash_profile file in order to customize bash-it.\n\n\nIf you're afraid of a full-on switch to zsh, bash-it is a nice middle ground that keeps you on bash but gives you a lot of powerful plugins to extend your environment with.\n\nA: A solution when switching from ubuntu is to use homebrew, a package manager for Mac OSX. In particular, for git, you will have included a number of additions including bash completion. This will be true for other programs which are faliliar for developpers, like make.\nIn 2 steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*install with ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)\"\n\n*Run brew doctor to get your path set up properly\n\n*Install git and bash completion: brew install git bash-completion\n\n*Add the command return in the previous step in your .bash_profile.\n\n*Restart your bash sessions once the new tools and configuration are written to your file system. \n\n\nMore on this howto.\n\nA: The easiest way to get autocompletion on OS X is to switch your shell to zsh.\n\n\n*\n\n*Change default shell from bash to zsh\nYou can test things by running zsh in iTerm and terminal before making the switch above. If you really want to stick with bash you can start with these two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to auto-complete the open command in Terminal?\n\n*How can I make autocomplete in the shell work with case-folding?\n", "Q: Newly-upgraded Mavericks machine hangs on startup I just upgraded to Mavericks on my 2.8 quad desktop, and now it won't fully boot.  It gets to the Apple logo, then hangs. I tried safe boot but got the same result.  Where to next?\n\nA: 1) You have a backup, right?\n2) Boot into the recovery partition: hold option before apple logo appears, select recovery hd.\n3) Run disk utiity form the recovery hd, select your boot partition (usually macintosh hd), and hit verify disk. It will probably find errors on the partition.\n4) If disk utility finds errors, hit \"repair disk\" in disk utility. If it succeeds, you should be able to boot normally. If it fails, reformat and reinstall. \nIf disk utility doesn't find errors... try reinstalling without reformatting. \n\nA: Thanks for your assistance.\nI have time machine as my back up.  Is that going to be useful or should I hang my head in shame?\nDisc utility says the HD appears ok but I paused before electing to back up from the time machine external disk because it talks about reformatting the HD as part of the back up/recovery process.  I wanted to check with the experts first.\n", "Q: Power Connector for SSD in 2009 Mac Pro I have a Samsung 840 Pro in my 2009 Mac Pro, and due to the 2009 Mac Pro only being SATA 2 I get about half the read/write speeds.

(Terminal is the only place I have this problem.)\n\nA: I was able to fix this by going to Terminal->Preferences->Advanced and choosing xterm-256color as the setting for \"Declare Terminal As\"\n", "Q: Why does Time Machine's backup size not equal the size of my hard drive? I'm using Time Machine to back up my data on my Mac to an external HD, so I can restore my data on a fresh OS installation, but Time Machine's resulting backup is only 43 GB.\nMy laptop's HD is 113 GB in size. Why is Time Machine only backing up 43 GB, not the entire amount?\nDoes Time Machine exclude a lot of files? Are only my apps and personal files saved? 43 GB seems pretty small.\n\nA: Not all files are backed up by Time Machine, but most files are backed up by Time Machine. There's a user-level exclusion list and a built-in exclusion list. The built-in exclusion list excludes things that are non-essential for restoring a system like log files and what not.\nApps can also exclude their own data from Time Machine by marking files with meta-data tags to exclude them from backups. For example: a web browser may chose to mark its cache directories as excluded from the Time Machine backups because cached surfing data isn't essential to a restore.\nThere's already a great Q&A on Ask Different that deals with how you see the exclusions list in Time Machine to see what's in the back and what isn't. It was asked and written for Lion, but it applies to anything Lion and post-Lion so far, including Mavericks. That includes details on how to see the built-in list as well as which apps have excluded data from the backups.\nIn short: don't panic if your first backup isn't the same size as all used space on your hard drive. It wasn't meant to be.\n", "Q: iMovie 10.0.1 Upgrade/Install Fails With \"an error has occurred\" Message The download in the App Store can't be installed, restarted, or deleted. \nThis is for iMovie 10.0.1 as of December 23, 2013. I followed a discussion forum and tried a suggestion that said remove the application from finder. Unfortunately, this left me without the iMovie application and did nothing to change the status of iMovie from \"downloaded\". So, I can't even start over or resume. Is there a clean way to get out of this mess? The forums go on and on with various solutions and responses that say that one \"...worked for me!\".  \nMy system software is OS X 10.9.1 running on a MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch, Early 2013. \n\nA: To investigate the problem, please run Console to check the recent logs for more details (look for com.apple.installd).\nIn example, I had something like:\ncom.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.installd[69518]) Job appears to have crashed: Abort trap: 6\nReportCrash[69520]: Saved crash report for installd[69518] version 332 to /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/installd_2014*.crash\n\nIf you see the crash in your logs, then check the backtrace under System Diagnostic Reports, so there is something like:\nTerminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[NSKeyedUnarchiver initForReadingWithData:]: incomprehensible archive\n\nThe reason for that could be that some of the downloaded files are corrupted.\nSo to solve that, you have to remove these files and try again.\n\nSimple solution\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit your App Store\n\n*Run Finder and go to (CMD+Shift+G): /private/var/folders.\n\n*Trash all the folders from that folder (e.g. vp, zz).\n\n*Run App Store and re-try.\n\n\nIn case something bad happens, restore these removed files from your Trash.\n\nAdvanced solution\nFrom Terminal check if you've temporary files here:\nls -la /private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.appstore\n\nAnd then try to remove them (you may backup them first just in case):\nrm -frv /private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.appstore\n\nWarning: Make sure you won't do any typos (like adding space between the folders), as you could remove the wrong files!\nAnd re-try to run installer again.\n\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4483444\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4234582\n\nA: Don't worry.

You can go to the AT&T websites and fill out a form to see if the phone could be unlocked. If you can't get AT&T to unlock the phone, then you could take that up with the seller of the phone or perhaps see about jailbreaking the device and unlocking it by force as opposed to by social convention. \n", "Q: How to Record Both Mic Audio and Speakers while using headset I'm trying to record my screen with sound at the same time, but right now, my jack stopped working (it's with the red light) and I have to use a headset so that I can have sound on my Mac.\nSo my question is: Can I record my screen, my audio input (me babbling) and the supposed audio output that should come from speakers (that now its coming out from my headset).\nIs there a way, Or is it just impossible?\n\nA: I've seen many questions like this. The simple solution is Soundflower. You can download it for free at http://cycling74.com/products/soundflower/.

I have created an alias of the htdocs folder in Skydrive and placed it in the XAMPP directory but I'm having file permission problems in the form of…\n\nAccess forbidden!\nYou don't have permission to access the requested directory. There is either no index document or the directory is read-protected.\n\nIf I understand correctly, instead of just changing the Skydrive folder permissions I also need to change the parent directories so \"/Users/Adam/Documents/Skydrive/xampp/htdocs\" needs to have read and write permissions for \"everyone\".

If so everything should be fine as I'm the only user on the laptop.\n\nA: Instead of using an 'alias' at the Finder level, you might want to use the terminal to create a 'symlink'.\nThe command to do this is ln so you can learn more with man ln - but you can also check out these two articles that explain the concept a little clearer than the man page.\n\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2001110610290643\nhttp://gigaom.com/2011/04/27/how-to-create-and-use-symlinks-on-a-mac/\n\nTo answer your other question, yes, everyone means EVERYONE, in addition to every user on the laptop.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2011 Unibody 10.7.5 fatally crashes even after recent repair, (lines across screen, graphics glitches, freeze up) Out of nowhere, my MacBook Pro 2011 unibody running 10.7.5 began to crash. After the crashes, in the boot sequence you could see very thin horizontal red lines. The red lines were so thin that I can't take a picture as the lines won't show up in photos. While you could see the red lines across the screen, the computer will not boot up, not even to recovery. After leaving the computer off for a few hours, it will boot-up like nothing happened.\nAfter diagnosis of the whole comp, it turned out I had over 60 bad sectors and naturally I needed a new hard drive, although at first it was suspected that I had a bad graphics card. So a new hard drive was installed and the computer was working 100% ok again. However, as soon as I migrated my old user from the backups and logged into the migrated user, the computer began to crash in exactly the same way as before.\nThe waits between when the computer could finally boot up became longer and longer, up to 24hrs.\nNow this is the interesting part, the computer works completely fine when I'm logged in into the default user that I have from installing the new hard drive, it's as soon as I log into the migrated user that the computer completely blocks up.\nI thought maybe the ram has gone bad, so I checked it with memtest and it seems to be completely ok. I then checked the temperatures while running a stress test. and Although the CPU cores under max load reach up 95ºC, the heatsinks manage just fine staying at 50ºC. While playing HD videos the graphics processor is staying relatively cool without any spikes in temp.\nI check the permissions of the disk and I did find a massive amount of errors which I repaired but apart from that there shouldn't be anything wrong since it's a new hard drive.\nTL:DR\n\n\n*\n\n*2011 MacBook Pro 10.7.5 crashed — shows very thin, horizontal red lines across screen.\n\n*Full diagnosis revealed bad sectors in HD. Graphics, RAM, CPU, and temps are ok.\n\n*After installing new HD everything worked fine.\n\n*After migration, when using the old user from the migration (backup), the computer crashes again.\n\n*Using default user results in no crashes.\n\n\nA: I recently had this issue.  It turns out that Apple has a repair program for this issue at no cost that runs until Dec 31, 2016. Here is the link:\nhttps://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nI took my laptop in to the nearest Apple Store. The Genius Bar tech ran a diagnostic test to verify the issue.  They sent it to a repair location in Texas and in 3-5 days I had it back.  There is also a 90 warranty on the work.  \n\nA: Thin horizontal red lines on boot doesn't sound like a hard drive issue. It's possible that you have two separate issues with your Macbook.\nIt sounds like there's an issue with your CPU/graphics/mainboard. This would explain the need to wait for an extended period of time before another successful boot. If you ask me, 95 deg. C is way too hot! Perhaps the heatsink is loose or the fans are clogged. The fact that you could log into the default user without issue is perhaps just a coincidence; maybe you weren't logged into that account long enough to notice any problems.\n", "Q: iPod 2G not allowing sync of supported video I have some videos that I would like to copy onto an old iPod Touch 2Gen for my daughter, so that she doesn't have to see the horror of YouTube.  The specs for the device (as taken from here) show that the following are supported video types:\n\nH.264 video, up to 1.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Low-Complexity version of the H.264 Baseline Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats; H.264 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Baseline Profile up to Level 3.0 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats; MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats\n\nQuicktime shows the following when playing the video:\n\nAnd iTunes has the following in Get Info:\n\nBut when I try to copy the file via iTunes, it says the file is not supported:\n\nHow can I found out exactly what is is complaining about, so I can fix it?\n\nA: I have seen people mention that when they had an issue like this they changed the resolution to 640 by 480 pixels.\n\nA: Have you tried running one of the files through Handbrake. I know there is an option in the devices presets that is called iPod. Perhaps that has the right settings. If that works, you can look at the differences between the Handbrake settings and what Quicktime has and perhaps pick up something that way.\nUsing the iPod presets in Handbrake will select the 'iPod 5G support' and add the MOOV atom to the video file. The MOOV atom is the index information in MPEG-4 files, this atom makes it possible to play the file before it is completely loaded.\n\n\nA: I was having issues using Handbrake for my iPod Touch 2nd Gen.  The trick was going to the Video tab and setting...\nH.264 Profile: Baseline\nH.264 Level:   3.0\nI also set the max width to 720 on all my videos, but unsure how big the can be.\n", "Q: Defining some global GIT settings to be automatically inherited Sysnopsis\nComing from a Linux background I still find Apples' modifications to the Unix hierarchy somewhat confusing.

On my iPhone running iOS 7, I have the Personal Hotspot feature, but I can't turn it on. I've read that it's been disabled by my carrier, AT&T, since the feature is plan dependent. How can I bypass this and still enable Personal Hotspot?\n\nA: If you're willing to jailbreak, you can use TetherMe. It will enable Personal Hotspot then change the location of the data to appear to be coming from inside the device, thereby bypassing the carrier's disable.\n\n TetherMe\nDynamically enables native tethering or personal hotspot for iOS3.X or newer devices. This should work on any carrier without the need for customised bundles or preferences.\nTetherMe has been tested to work on all iOS versions from 3.0 to 6.1 and works by telling the iPhone to allow tethering on any APN that is used for iPhone data. As a result, you should not be charged any more for tethering data than normal data by your phone company as all tethering data appears to come from the phone itself.\n\n", "Q: Time Machine - multiple backup destinations for a \"separate weekly\" I have a client that I'm setting up Time Machine to backup his Macbook Pro.  He's running OSX Mountain Lion, but soon to upgrade to Mavericks.\nIt has been backing up using Time Machine and an external USB drive.\nHe wants to add a 2nd USB drive to get a weekly backup that he'll store offsite.\nWe've setup the 2nd drive and had Time Machine point to that 2nd drive and it is creating an initial backup now to it.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If he unplugs the 2nd drive after the initial backup and then takes it home, when he plugs it back in next week does it backup what has been changed since today's initial backup to it?  Meaning, does Time Machine base the backup off of the destination media in conjunction with the source?  Or will it only backup what hasn't been backed up in the last hour (assuming the 1st external drive is plugged in this whole week and Time Machine has been backing up as normal to it)?\n\n*Will Time Machine treat each external backup drive as 2 independent backups, each with their own \"sync\" with the source hard disk?\n\n\nBasically, what I want to make sure happens is:\n\n\n*\n\n*EXTERNAL DRIVE #1 = NORMAL backups....daily/hourly/weekly/etc. always plugged in.\n\n*EXTERNAL DRIVE #2 = WEEKLY/DR backups....only plugged in once a week (or less) and backs up everything since the last time it was plugged in...regardless of what the backups for EXTERNAL DRIVE #1 have been doing.\n\n\nThank you.\n\nA: Basically, I would recommend not trying to constrain time machine to only a weekly interval on the offsite drive.\nThat being said, you can have both drives work totally independently as that is how the software is engineered. If you really only want a weekly snapshot, only connect the weekly drive once a week and force a rotation of the destination:\n tmutil startbackup --rotation\n\nOnce you have a backup to the weekly drive, eject it and send it away. As long as all dives get reattached every 14 days or so, you won't get a warning dialog that any are out of date. \nAgain, you can certainly enforce a single weekly backup by the procedure you follow but two things make that practice less needed than you might expect:\n\n\n*\n\n*The backup intervals are very low space overhead compared to the size of cheap backup disks. \n\n\nOn my worst Mac, the system averages 5 MB of overhead for system log files so in absence of user files changing, you have 24 daily and 31 monthly snapshots you would avoid storing 275 MB (or 0.0003 of a one TB drive) if you were on a strict one per week schedule.\nSince the cleanup of old backups is so fast and the storage impact so low, most clients with offsite rotation end up just swapping disks each week and let the software cull the extra snapshots per the normal schedule, leaving weekly snapshots more than a month old. \n\nA: I didn't get it. \nDoes Time Machine copy 2 backups on the 2 external hard disks or uses 2 hard disks to take one backup.\nI set one external hard disk as the backup destination. Then again opened Time Machine Preferences and selected another one. The message appears as \" if you use both hard disks, Time machine will take turn backing up to ... and ...\" Does it mean one back up or two back up?\n", "Q: How can I get sound working on Bootcamp + Windows 8.1? Windows 8.1 isn't playing back audio on my 13\" mid-2012 Macbook Pro.  I only have a speaker with an x on my notifications bar.  When I click on it, I get the usual \"detecting problems\" garbage.  Unfortunately, every \"solution\" I've found seems to work for everyone else, but not for me.\n\nDevice Manager\nWindows shows a High Definition Audio Controller listed under System.  Its properties state that it has a Code 10 - \"This device cannot start\", along with \"The requested operation was unsuccessful.\"  This is the only notion of an audio device listed in Device Manager.\nMost solutions I've found say drivers need to be reinstalled (downloaded from the internet or simpliy re-run from the Bootcamp support drivers) and I've currently tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bootcamp setup.exe (No errors are reported, 5.0.5033 \"installs\" a variety of sound drivers)\n\n*Cirrus Audio (Both CirrusAudiox64.exe and a manual .inf installation)\n\n*Realtek (I've tried nearly every link I've found) \n\n*Intel Graphics 4000 (apparently it does audio too)\n\n\nEvery executable runs and reports success, however, I don't see any sign of a change apart from the Realtek driver copying files somewhere in Program Files, and the Intel driver blanking the screen a few times.\n\nCirrus Audio\nI've tried manually installing the Cirrus Audio driver by performing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select High Definition Audio Controller from Device Manager\n\n*Click on Driver -> Update Driver\n\n*Select \"Browse my computer for driver \"\n\n*Select \"Let me pick from a list of device drivers\"\n\n*Click \"Have Disk...\" and navigate to the .inf file\n\n\nAt this point windows complains that the driver does not support Windows x64, despite having \"x64\" written all over it.\n\"The folder you specified doesn't contain a compatible software driver for your device. If the folder contains a driver, make sure it is designed to work with Windows for x64-based systems.\"\nIf I skip #'s 4 and 5, and browse directly for the driver files, Windows reports that the Driver software is already up to date.\n\"Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date.\"\nThis makes me believe that Windows 8.1 might have an issue with certain drivers, deeming them unusable in some way.  It's possible that windows is denying the .exe installers' drivers, Realtek, and Cirrus behind the scenes, without letting them install anything.  Maybe they report success and silently fail?\n\nSetup\nIt's worth mentioning that my Bootcamp setup isn't typical.  I've partitioned the hard drive and installed windows manually, alongside Arch Linux.  (I've triple booted this thing, and windows audio is the final hurdle.)  I'm also using the refind efi bootloader to boot the system.\nFor the windows boot option, I point refind to /EFI/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi, without any options. I'm thinking that Bootcamp might do more than partition and install, and that I'm supposed to do more to inform windows about the macbook hardware at this stage.  Is this the case?  Did I miss something critical about Bootcamp?\n\nIf anyone can help me solve this, I will be eternally grateful.  Thanks.\nP.S. I'm a linux user, so windows drivers aren't exactly my forte.  If I'm doing something totally wrong, please let me know.\n\nA: Forget EFI and install using boot camp assistant.\nAfter backing everything up, wiping my partitions, and installing Windows 8.1 using Bootcamp, everything works as normal.  The machine boots using bios mode, Cirrus Audio was properly installed after a single run of setup.exe from the Bootcamp support software, and the device is recognized properly as VEN_1013 DEV_4206 --Cirrus Audio CS4206B (AB 82).\nIt sucks, but it's worth it.  I plan on resizing windows' ntfs partition and booting linux beside it, but that's a problem for another day.\n\nA: Navigate on your Mac to the Bootcamp application. Before this make sure you have a 8GB USB flashdrive formatted to FAT 32, Windows default. Open Bootcamp app, and install the latest Bootcamp drivers onto the USB.  I suggest naming the USB to SUPPORT all caps after doing this.\nNavigate to Windows Partition   on boot menu.\nOpen up File Explorer, click on you new SUPPORT drive, open up Bootcamp folder, then drivers, click on Realtek driver set up .exe, and install that (depending on your computer it will prompt you to restart it or not after installing). Next after rebooting or re-installing the Realtek driver,  head into the Cirrus folder.\nThis is the most important part about getting the sound to work\nClick on the second .exe driver manual download, and run it. If you don't do the second one first, it won't work.   After the download is complete, click on the first Cirrussetup.exe and install that. After that is complete, when you go to test your Mac's sound, there will be a slight delay... followed by the nice obnoxious chirp on Microsoft's sound test.\nSound working on Windows 8.1 x64 at 10:50, 2/21/2015\n\nA: So what I just did was I pluged my bootable usb drive (from bootcamp) back in and went into bootcamp>drivers>Cirrus then clicked the exe and it auto changed the drivers and enabled my microphone as well. hope this helps!\n\nA: If you installing Windows 7/8/8.1 on MAC in EFI (native) mode - you'll get problem with sound.\nIf you installing Windows in BootCamp mode - you'll get corrupted files on your hybrid MBR/GPT disc if you'll try to use same files on both systems.\nIf you have only 1 system (Windows in bios mode or Mac OS in gpt) - no problem.\nSo you have to decide.\n", "Q: iCal calendar for official holidays in Berlin city Where I can get an iCal calendar for official holidays in Berlin city?

It can now be placed in the Dock.\n\nA: Automator and AppleScript are the best ways at creating custom scripts/apps that perform commands as you described.  Each have their pros and cons.  For most tasks I prefer to write AppleScripts, probably because I'm a programmer myself and because they are easy to access and edit.  \nTo write AppleScripts, you can use the OS X provided program called \"AppleScript Editor.\"  AppleScript editor allows you to write your AppleScripts and save them as an actual AppleScript with a file extension of .scpt or as an Application (.app) which can be run from anywhere.\nIf you save your AppleScript in the AppleScript format (.scpt), and with the help of a application called FastScripts (also available in the Mac App Store), all your personal scripts and system scripts can be made easily accessible in the menubar.  And Fast Scripts provides the extra benefit of allowing you to assign keyboard shortcuts to them.  You can do the same with Automator workflows, I just find it's easier to do with AppleScripts and FastScripts.\nHere is a sample AppleScript I created that I have previously shared on the boards that toggles the visibility of hidden files in OS X.  This is one of my more basic scripts which is I why I am showing it as an example of how simple it is to write an AppleScript.  With the help of FastScripts, I set a keyboard shortcut of ^ + ⌘ + ⇧ + . to activate this script.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    set hiddenFilesDisplayStatus to do shell script \"defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles\"\n    set hiddenFilesNewDisplayStatus to \"NO\"\n\n    if hiddenFilesDisplayStatus is \"NO\" then\n        set hiddenFilesNewDisplayStatus to \"YES\"\n    end if\n\n    do shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles \" & hiddenFilesNewDisplayStatus\n    do shell script \"killall Finder\"\n\nend tell\n\nI have a variety of other AppleScripts that perform various tasks, so if I were you, look at AppleScripts first, then look at using Automator.  There are many resources out there for helping you create AppleScripts, and you'll find that there are many others that have already written AppleScripts that may already do what you are looking for.\nTo answer your specific use case\nTry creating an AppleScript with the following command, notice the fully qualified path to xterm. On my machine it was different than yours. It's important to note that I have XQuartz installed on my machine since Mavericks does not come shipped with X11 any longer.\ndo shell script \"/usr/X11/bin/xterm -fg orange -bg black -e ssh me@myserver\"\n\nI tried the above command, pointed to my server and it worked fine.  What would be really cool if you got this working with this AppleScript  is that you could even set up the AppleScript to ask for input for the username and server you with to connect to, and it'll set that in the shell script command for you and if nothing is provided, you could have it default to a particular username/server. :)\nFYI, I figured out the pathing issue to xterm using this SO article: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11206872/open-xterm-telnet-connection-mac-os-x\n", "Q: Changing icon of app using CandyBar failing on OS X 10.4.11 Tiger So I'm using OS X 10.4.11 Tiger on Power PC (old iBook G4 - gift/joke for Christmas) and I installed and am happily using CandyBar to customize the icons.\nHowever, I want to customize the icon for TenFourFox, as it isn't all that esthetic. I have the .png, .ico, and .icns of the icon I want to use, but whenever I try to use CandyBar to change the icon, it just takes the placeholder for that type of file, as you can see here:\nDefault TenFourFox in CandyBar:\n\nTrying custom icon (drag-and-drop):\n\nDoes anyone have any clue what is going on and how to fix it?\nBTW, I'm using CandyBar 2.6.1, if that could be part of it. The newest version only supports 10.5+.\n\nA: Version 2.6.1 unfortunately didn't have Pixadex built in, and those image wells only supported the actual Icon of whatever it is that gets dropped in them. For example, the .png files you dropped in currently have the icon of:\n\nand that's exactly what it's giving you. So essentially what gets dropped in those image wells needs to be represented (having the icon) with what you drop in there. If you try dragging anything that already has a custom icon associated with it into the image well you'll quickly understand how it works.\nI found the best way to manage icons before CandyBar 3 was to use Pixadex in addition to CandyBar 2, since it allows drag and drop between the two apps. It's precisely why they eventually merged the two, because they really did belong together. \n• Pixadex 2.0.2 download (works with 10.2+) and other older icon related things.\n", "Q: Is there a way to refresh a file that is opened by TextEdit? As an academic, I often have to conduct \"numerical experiments\" by running a small computer program that outputs to a text file.\nI use TextEdit to read the text file.\nHowever, when I re-run the program, and the contents of the text file changes, I find that the contents in TextEdit do not automatically update to the new version.\nIn order to access the new version, I need to close the existing TextEdit window, and open the file again in TextEdit.\nIs there a way to refresh the file to the new version in TextEdit?\nFor those of you who know about the program Vim, what I am looking for is like the command :e[dit] in Vim which allows one to\n\nEdit the current file. This is useful to re-edit the current file, when it has been changed outside of Vim.\n\n\nA: There's a ugly way of doing it, as far as I know. \nOnce the file has been edited just try to save it. TextEdit will prompt you saying something like:\n\nThe document \"Untitled.txt\" couldn't be saved. Other application modified the file.\n\nGiving you the choice to either Restore or Save anyway. \nWhile Save anyway will keep your changes and save as a new version the changes made by the other application, Restore will update your file with these new changes. \nUnless there's a specific reason to use TextEdit I'd recommend using any other text editor, such as TextMate, which supports the automatic refresh. \n\nA: Refresh current open file is refresh by using\n ALT+F and R\n", "Q: Boot from USB iBook G4 Power PC I recently got an old iBook G4 (as many of you might have noticed with all of my recent questions :D) and I wanted to install Ubuntu via USB (the iso doesn't fit on a CD and the iBook doesn't read DVDs, I've tried).\nSo I went a-searching the internet for ways to do this. \nI started off trying to boot from the USB stick via holding down option after the chime, but that just listed the Macintosh HD. So I went on searching and came across this: http://ben-collins.blogspot.com/2010/08/booting-your-ibook-g4-from-usb-stick.html and tried it multiple times, but all failed (I believe the iBook wasn't recognizing the USB stick, as nothing came up when I ran dev usb0 and then ls.)\nI then read this question: How do I make my 1.5 GHz PowerBook G4 boot from a USB stick?, but that didn't work, even when I swapped out the suffix \\\\yaboot for \\\\tdxi. Sadly, nothing is working!\nDoes anyone know of any workarounds or something I can do to get this working?\n\nA: I know this old, but I just solved this problem, and I had found this question while searching for an answer. \nIn my case, 2005 iBook wouldn't recognise the 10.5 install DVD. I imaged the DVD to an 8GB usb stick in Disk Utility. I did format the USB stick as Apple Partition Map first in case that makes a difference.\nIt wouldn't boot from the USB when holding down option or C though I could get a menu.\nI booted to open firmware by booting with command+option+O+F\nthen I ran the following command:\nboot usb0/disk@1:3,\\\\:tbxi\nIt booted into the installer and everything worked as expected.\n", "Q: Losi iPhone 5 and device is turned off and hence can not locate using Find my Phone app I lost my iphone 5.

The next thing I did was called the customer  service (mine was T-Mobile) and they temporarily suspended my line. I immediately changed all my passwords. I never got my brand new iPhone 5.

I want to be able to host other content on port 80.\nIs there a way I can change the path where the Xcode Server webpage is hosted?\nTo clarify, I want to access Xcode Server by typing either http://host.name.tld/xcode or http://host.name.tld:43211, rather than it being the root document served on port 80. I can't find anything to this effect in the auto-configured Apache config file.\n\nA: First, make sure you are looking at the right apache config.  Base OS X includes a config file, but the one used in Server is at /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/sites.  \nThe two lines that makes Xcode the default is in 0000_any_80_.conf:\nDocumentRoot \"/Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default\"\nDirectoryIndex index.html index.php /xcode/ /wiki/ default.html\n\nThat means Apache will look for an index first in /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default, but if there isn't an index file, it will try to use /xcode/ as the index (and will fall back to the wiki after that).\nTo override it, all you need to do is put some content in index.html. After that, you will still be able to access Xcode server in http://host.name.tld/xcode\n\nA: You can do this with the OS X Server app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Server.app.\n\n*Go to the Websites service.\n\n\n*Double-click your server website in the list.\n\n\n*Click Edit… for Index Files.\n\n\n*Delete /xcode/ from the list.\n\n\n*Click OK on both boxes and wait for the service to update.\n\n\nThen Xcode will only be accessible from host.name.tld/xcode\n\nA: In an effort to keep this somewhat up to date, deleting Xcode's config file  as suggested by Apple Support seems to do the trick:\n/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/other/COM.APPLE.WEBAPP.XCODE.conf\nThe server root no longer always redirects to http://example.com/xcode/, and Xcode is still accessible via http://example.com/xcode/.\nNow, if someone knows how to make it only accessible via a specific subdomain (http://xcode.example.com/xcode/), I'm all ears...\n", "Q: Retina MacBook Pro freezes after replacement screen fitted I have a rMBP 975, mid-2012, running 10.9.1, and half a month ago, I went to the Genius bar to change my screen.

Those are not unreasonable values for Fahrenheit.  Go into the settings and switch to Celsius.\n\nA: There is no way those temp are in Celsius.\nYour 194 F = 94 C !\nThe Intel specification for maximum operating temp is 110 dgr Celsius.\nOnce that temp is reached the build in self protection kicks in and reduces the power.\nSo the CPU will self protect from melting.\nHowever, since your fans are running at full speed, it is getting hot in there.\nYou might want to use the Official tools from Intel to see how your CPU is actually doing.\n\nA: Hopefully you're not running a browser showing Flash video. I notice my Mac Mini and Macbook Air trigerring the fans unnecessarily when I open Youtube and other websites that use Flash. This can happen even hours after I watched the Flash video but kept that browser open. \nMy advice, always close those browser that opened a Flash video.\n\nA: That's the same on my late 2013: when I watch youtube videos on Chrome, temp goes to almost 100°C.

But there is no way to print from iOS devices because they need AirPrint compatible printer. Firstly, i installed handyPrint on mac, and everything was fine, but it works only when mac is on. So I tried and Printer Pro Lite application on iPhone. App can see printer but doesn't print anything. So I try to understand is there any possible way to tune my printer as AirPrint printer to print whenever I want? Or maybe install the right app on iPhone which can print?\n\nA: Printer Pro won't solve the problem because\n\nPrinter Pro is the application that lets you wirelessly print from the iPhone. It can print directly to many Wi-Fi printers and to any printer attached to your Mac or PC via helper application installed on your computer.\n\nIf you search for \"HP print\" in the App Store, there are quite a lot of hits. HP All-in-One Printer Remote looks kind of helpful (but I can't test it myself).\n\nA: If you don't mind jailbreaking, you can install TruPrint. This will let you AirPrint to most printers connected to a network automatically.\n\n TruPrint\nWith TruPrint, you can print to most network printers! Simply install, and use Apple's built-in print menu. New printers will now show up thanks to TruPrint!\n\n\nA: I've not seen any emulation software for printers that \"tune\" them to support the AirPrint network printing protocol on top of old HP hardware. That would be workable for a network printer, but the 1200 doesn't even have any network hardware, so you still need a device similar to AirPort to advertise the printer on the network as an AirPrint device and then subsequently translate all the print actions into legacy printing language or possibly postscript.\nMy guess as to your best bet is to pick a reputable AirPrint software package to run on OS X since it's cheaper than the alternatives.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ecamm.com/mac/printopia/\nThere are many others besides printopia and possibly packages that run on other OS, but for my time+hassle equation it fits a sweet spot. It's easy to ask someone if $20 is worth the hassle of saving all their files to dropbox or similar and then printing them later. People also seem to get that printing won't work if the computer bridging the AirPrint request to the legacy printing format is not running.\n", "Q: Efficient MKV H.264 player with GPU decoding for Mac OS X How can I play MKV files from QuickTime in Mavericks?\nI used to use Perian but it hangs and the other third party players are very inefficient as  QuickTime is the most optimized software among the ones I analyzed.\n\nA: I regularly watch MKV files with H.264 1080p video on my retina MBP 15\" (late 2013, Intel GPU only), and up until now, I did so using the latest version of VLC. Unfortunately the battery drains pretty quickly with this setup and I decided to investigate alternatives. In trying to be a little scientific, I created a spreadsheet listing the CPU time used (checked in Activity Monitor) for each alternative that I tested. For all testing, I played the first 1 minute of a video clip of my choosing, with H.264 1080p video and DTS audio, as well as remuxing it to M4V format using MP4Tools, and in the process transcoding the audio to AAC 2-channel (the video was untouched). I measured the CPU time used after playing this first minute of the clip in Activity Monitor. Tests were performed with the computer plugged in to AC, and the resolution set to 1920 x 1200 (recall this is a retina MBP 15\"). The video was playing in the foreground, in windowed mode, maximized to use all the horizontal resolution available.\nThe baseline is QuickTime Player, playing the M4V version of the file, with hardware accelerated decoding supposedly enabled. This used up 4.51 CPU seconds.\nUsing VLC version 2.12, I got the following results:\n\n\n*\n\n*MKV file, software decoding: 28.89 CPU seconds;\n\n*MKV file, hardware accelerated decoding: 22.82 CPU seconds;\n\n*M4V file, software decoding: 29.76 CPU seconds;\n\n*M4V file, hardware accelerated decoding: 22.44 CPU seconds.\n\n\nIn MPlayerX version 1.0.21 (1718), I got the following results (no mention is made to hardware acceleration since I couldn't find a way to enable or disable it, and have no idea what is the default behavior):\n\n\n*\n\n*MKV file: 15.92 CPU seconds;\n\n*M4V file: 15.74 CPU seconds.\n\n\nFinally I tried Movist version 1.3.3, which supports using QuickTime or FFmpeg as the decoder, and also has a checkbox for hardware acceleration. However, I was unable to decode the MKV version of the file using the QuickTime decoder. The results are:\n\n\n*\n\n*MKV file, software decoding, FFmpeg decoder: 31.96 CPU seconds;\n\n*MKV file, hardware accelerated decoding, FFmpeg decoder: 8.31 CPU seconds;\n\n*M4V file, software decoding, FFmpeg decoder: 30.73 CPU seconds;\n\n*M4V file, hardware accelerated decoding, FFmpeg decoder: 9.04 CPU seconds;\n\n*M4V file, software decoding, QuickTime decoder: 37.03 CPU seconds; \n\n*M4V file, hardware accelerated decoding, QuickTime decoder: 8.12 CPU seconds.\n\n\nAs can be seen, Movist using the FFmpeg decoder and hardware accelerated decoding is the most efficient alternative compared to VLC or MPlayerX, but still noticeably less efficient than QuickTime at decoding M4V files. The ideal solution would be playing MKV under QuickTime Player, but it appears Perian no longer works in Mavericks.\n\nA: Give MPV a shot. The project is located on github if you wish to compile your own version. Information on compiling can be found here.\nIt aims to cut out the legacy code of mplayer and bring together the benefits of mplayer2. The result is quite impressive, though still in its infancy for OS X.\nUnofficial builds can be found here. I am testing mpv_20131222004653_git-4833e92 compiled on Dec 22, 2013 and can tell you it works.\nAdditionally, you may wish to adopt some of the better configuration options, as outlined by pigoz himself.\nAs per your question, you may want to focus directly on opengl-hq which focused directly on offloading the video stream to the GPU.\nIn my testing, I've found MPV to trump MPlayer OSX Extended by up to half while playing back MKV files.\n\nA: I like Movist. With Movist I don't need to reboot to Windows, using bootcamp, anymore. Movist can also play DXVA 2.0.\n\nA: For me mpv used less CPU than MPlauerX too.\nBut when checked \"Power\" tab in Activity Monitor mpv consumed much more juice in full-screen. So for temperature / battery sensitive case MPlayerX seems to be better suited (it may depend on configs of course i.e. scaler/postprocess/... filters).\nFor 720p mkv/h264 video power usage was 30 mpv vs 20+1 MplayerX\nFor 2160 webm/vp9 - 120 mpv vs 140 MplayerX\n\nA: xvmc works but is not ideal when you need long battery life\n", "Q: Boot Camp Assistant Missing?

Or even quicker, just by browsing my Games/Arcade folder in LaunchBar and press enter to run a game.

It would seem that it's being given the full original path of the file, which indeed is not a folder.\nThe intended use of this Workflow is to be used as part of a Hazel action (by stripping off the initial Get Finder Items action). Can anyone tell me how I can solve this problem of encrypting an existing PDF in situ?\nPossible options I have thought of include:\n1. Figure out how to strip the file name off the variable.\n2. Figure out how to encrypt the PDF using AppleScript (and thus making the variable handling much more flexible)\n3. Use some other method from within Hazel than Automator/AppleScript.\nPlease note I am aware of the scripts out there to use PDFPen, but I do not like the fact that PDFPen has to launch just to encrypt a PDF, especially when the OS has the capability built in.\nI am something of a novice with both Automator and AppleScript but am a programmer by trade, so any suggestions welcome.\n\nA: I would go with option #2. \nYou can use command line tools to handle the encryption. A quick google search reveals a free, for non-commercial use, tool\nhttp://community.coherentpdf.com/\nwhich you can call using applescript like this:\ndo shell script \"cpdf -encrypt AES \\\"pass\\\" \\\"\\\" in.pdf -o out.pdf\"\nThis way there are no dialog boxes to enter a password.

Dell has announced that they're going to release a 4k monitor under $1000 in the beginning of 2014, and also has a 24\" 4k monitor around $1300. The product page for the 24\" one mentions:\n\nOptimal resolution:\n  3840 x 21601 at 60 Hz (DP1.2*)\n  3840 x 21601 at 30 Hz HDMI  \n\nThe superscript 1 displays this warning:\n\nImportant Details\n  In order to display the 3840 x 2160 native resolution, please ensure the graphic card and its drivers used on the PC/Laptop is capable of supporting resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 at 60Hz via DisplayPort connectivity.\n\nSo the question is: Can the video card and Thunderbolt ports on a 2013 Macbook Air 13\" support resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 at 60Hz via DisplayPort connectivity?\nThe EveryMac page for this model says it may be able to drive two daisy-chained 2560x1600 Thunderbolt monitors, and this ars report claims that two TB monitors was possible on the 2012 models. So, I'm hopeful that the laptop should be able to drive that many pixels, but I'm not sure whether the Thunderbolt ports, in mini-DP mode, speak the DP1.2 standard necessary to drive this monitor at 60Hz.\n\nA: No, it won't support it. The Thunderbolt 1 controller in the Air only supports DisplayPort 1.1 and you need DisplayPort 1.2 to get 4K support, as you mention in your question.\nCheck out http://www.anandtech.com/show/7049/intel-thunderbolt-2-everything-you-need-to-know and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)#Thunderbolt_2\n\nA: No. Thunderbolt 2 is required.\n\nWhat is Thunderbolt 2?\nThunderbolt 2 is an update to the original Thunderbolt specification and takes the original’s two 10 Gbps bi-directional channels and combines them into a single 20 Gbps bi-directional channel. The amount of data able to go through a Thunderbolt connection hasn’t increased, but the throughput of a single channel has been doubled.\nWhat does Thunderbolt 2 have to do with 4K video?\n4K video (a video format that has four times the resolution as 1080p and is gaining popularity with video professionals) requires more bandwidth than the original Thunderbolt can accommodate. Thunderbolt 2 will be able to stream that 4K video and write it to disk at the same time.\n\nExcerpt from this MacWorld Article\n\nA: It might be able to.\nAccording to http://www.anandtech.com/show/7007/intels-haswell-an-htpc-perspective:\n\nHaswell does have 4K display support and we will have a dedicated section to see how well it works.\n\nThe whole section that they're talking about:\nhttp://www.anandtech.com/show/7007/intels-haswell-an-htpc-perspective/7\nA quote:\n\nThe good news is that Haswell's 4K over HDMI works well, in a limited sort of way.\n\nSo, maybe it will, maybe it won't, since mid-2013 and early-2014 MacBook Air only has mini-DisplayPort, so, you're adding the uncertainty of a rubbish adapter into the already fragile mix.\nIt would be nice if someone actually tries it extensively, and reports with some more certain results.\n\nUPDATE 0:\nAccording to http://www.redsharknews.com/technology/item/1646-editor-hacks-2011-macbook-air-to-output-4k from 2014-04, it looks like even 2011 MacBook Air may be able to support 4K resolution, albeit only at 25Hz and with some reliability issues, and 2011 had HD Graphics 3000, as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air#Specifications, whereas mid-2013 and early-2014 have HD Graphics 5000 from a Haswell CPU.\n\nUPDATE 1:\nAdditionally, there is a report of a 2012 MacBook Air, which has merely HD Graphics 4000, supporting a 4K Seiki -- http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1681560.  So, I'd say chances are very good that a mid-2013 MacBook Air wouldn't have much problems with 3840x2160@30Hz, either.\n\nA: Nope. 4K just isn't possible for owners of MacBook Air made in 2013 or 2014.\nThe problem is with the Intel HD5000 graphics card and Mac OS – and there is no amount of fiddling, EDID goofing, SwitchResX playing, or wishful hoping that makes this work under Mac OS.\nI decided to keep the Seiki and use it @4K under Windows (which works fine). It's a software issue. I also tried the patches on the internet (for Mac OS) and multiple different firmware updates for the display, but to no avail. Alas!\n\nA: I just did it tonight. Macbook Air mid 2013 \"no messing around just Catalina fully updated. HD4000 Graphics 4th Gen i5 1.8HHZ.

The tv picks up the signal at the correct resolution, however  it looks like there's a problem specific to the graphics driver for the Intel HD 5000 display adapter that causes half of the screen to get corrupted. \nThis was done following the instructions listed here: http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3633447. After doing this I ran into the problem described here: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1646972.\nFrom what I can tell there doesn't seem to be a solution to this as of now. Others report this working on old Macbook Airs and mac minis so I think its specific to the MBA 2013. \n\nA: 2013 MacBook Air update:\nI have a 2013 MacBook Air, the 39\" Seiki 4k tv, and the Accell MDP-to-HDMI active adapter.\nI have tried flashing 3 different firmware to the tv (39\" version, 50\" version, and a special version I found online that was hacked for 1080p @ 120Hz). I have tried both the HDMI cable that came with the tv as well as a top of the line HDMI 1.4 cable. I have tried this in HDMI-1 input and HDMI-3 input (the side).\nNothing worked, so I downloaded SwitchResX and tried to make some custom profiles. I cannot get it to work with the 2013 MacBook Air, but it seems to work fine under windows.\nThis leads me to believe that the Accell adapter, the Seiki tv, the HDMI cable, and the HDMI port are not part of the problem. I think the solution would be one of the following:\n1) Apple issues an update and the HD 5000 graphics card will be able to use 4k.\n2) Seiki releases a firmware update and then it'll work.\n3) Someone that knows a lot more than I do has figured out a setting within SwitchResX to make this work. I'm tinkering, but I have no idea what I'm doing.\nAfter a week, I am putting this tv on Craigslist for a couple hundred bucks, then regretting that I sold my Thunderbolt Display just to get a 1080p monitor :(\n", "Q: MacBook currently has quiet SSD, will adding extra HDD cause constant noise? My MacBook Pro has an SSD drive that runs silent, which is really great.\nI am considering removing the SuperDrive, moving the SSD to the optical bay, and adding a 7200-RPM regular HDD in the main compartment. \nI would install OS X on the SSD, and keep large files I seldom need on the HDD.\nWill there be a (new) constant spinning noise, or will the HDD be silent when not in use?\n\nA: Certainly it depends on the drive.  From my experience using Apple laptops that contained HDD's, there was NO noise unless the drive was failing (an unfortunately common occurrence).  But some HDD's are definitely louder than others.\nOne thing to clarify though: you will not hear the drive \"spinning\".  You may hear the drive being accessed. The primary source of noise is the actuator arm, not the spindle/platters.  When idle the drive should be silent.\n", "Q: How to restore Mac OS X on a new hard-drive? I am going to upgrade my MacBook Pro hard-drive, but before doing so I'm trying to figure out how to restore OS X on it. My DVD drive doesn't work so I cannot re-install from the DVD.\nI have a recent Time Machine backup, is that enough to restore the OS? And in that case, what would be the procedure? Also, in case the Time Machine restoration fails, is there any way to re-install OS X from a USB or external hard-drive? Any suggestion would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Yes a Time Machine (TM) backup is sufficient; you don't need to \"install\" the OS and then restore the backup.  However you will need a copy of the OS at least and that can definitely be placed on either a USB stick or external HDD. The OS media contains the utilities you'll need to restore the TM backup.  Example here.\n(edit for clarity) Depending on how new your MBP is, more specifically which version of OS X you have, you may also have a built in Recovery that has all the tools you need to do this as well.\n\nA: If you have access to the OSX installer (on the AppStore) you are better off installing the system on your new drive (just fire the installer and specify the external disc as a target). This will install the rescue partition that other methods may skip. Then you can boot from the new drive and import your data either from the old drive or from a time-machine backup (using Migration Assistant).\n\nA: Just restored my macbook pro late 2011 13\" running 10.7 off of nothing more than a time machine backup and it worked fine, even with a blank internal.  \nRemember to format your new drive with disk utility using the mac journaled file system.  \nMake sure your external drive is powered and on before you boot, then press option while booting.  \nSelect time machine, format the new drive, and restore.  \nSimple...\n\nA: For some reason it wouldn't boot from my Time Machine backup.  (Maybe I didn't partition it with a GUID partition table?)  It just flashed a disk with a question mark after trying to boot from the partition with the TM backup.\nSo I created a Mavericks install disk on my other computer, and booted from that disk.  I was a little worried that it wouldn't create a Restore partition on the new hard drive if I just selected \"Restore from Time Machine backup onto disk\", so I opted to do a Mavericks install onto the new hard drive.  Then, during Mavericks' opening sequence, they give you the option to copy everything from a Time Machine backup.  Voila!\n\nA: if you really like to have 1 to 1 the same it's better to copy the disk than to use Time Machine. With time machine it works like this at first it does a proper new os install the copies the files from these Folders back to your disk.\n/Applications\n/Users/*\n/Library/*\nso if you use something like homebrew, macports or fink or any other terminal tools witch install them selves in /usr/local/bin they will be lost.\nAlso things like changes made by lion tweaks\nand candybar etc. will be lost.\nAlso self made permission changes on System folders or icon changes on these folders may get lost.\nFor a 1 to 1 copy you can use a os x install usb stick or any live linux stick with gparted on it.\nthen clone the whole disk (including the hidden restore partition).\nnow boot into the new disks restore partition and run a disk permission verify/repair and if needed also a disk verify/repair so you know your os on the new disk works all fine.\n", "Q: Use rsync to automatically copy a file to another folder I found this command to copy the content of source to a destination folder.\nrsync -r source/* destination\n\nWhat I would really like is to have this command run automatically each time a file is added to my source folder.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: You could use, Automator and Folder actions to watch the folder and run the script.\nWhen launching Automator and choosing New, one of the options given is to make a 'Folder Action'. At the top of the screen after selecting Folder Action you are given the option to choose a folder to 'watch'.\n\nWhat I think you would want to do in your case is to then select 'Utilities' on the leftmost column, and then drag 'Run Shell Script' from the second column into the workflow window. \n\nHere is where you would write whatever script you would like to run when changes are made to the folder. In this case your rsync script.\n\n\nA: One quick and dirty solution to this question that is portable across UNIX platforms (not specific to OSX, but may be used on HP-UX, Solaris, Linux, etc.) is to call rsync from the user's crontab, and let rsync's folder synchronization logic itself determine if the folder has been changed or not.  One refinement to using this portable solution is to wrap the call to rsync with a date test between a touched file (actually its modification time) and the modification time of the folder that is to be synced, but this is not necessary unless the folders to be synced are very large (deep and/or wide).  A single folder with several subfolders is ideal for this solution.\nAn entry for the crontab that will perform the \"quick and dirty\" case at a minute polling interval is:\n# run sync every minute:\n* * * * * /usr/bin/rsync -avz $HOME/source_path $HOME/target/path 1>> $HOME/.my_sync.log 2>&1\n\nThat should do it for the quick and dirty case - in other words, the folders will be kept up-to-date within a minute of making a change.  Check the ~/.my_sync.log file for execution statuses - this file will grow without bounds over time, so once correct operation has been determined, change \">>\" to \">\" to at least log the most recent rsync status.\nAnother pointer is that the -z switch to rsync should be used when syncing over a network.  The -z switch will cause compression to be used for the network file transfers.  When using rsync to sync between folders on filesystems local to a server, the -z switch may usually be omitted.\nNote about using the crontab:\nIf you cannot edit your crontab with:\n$ crontab -e\n\nThen you'll have to give yourself permission to have a crontab.  See the man page for crontab.  In OSX, this is what needs to be done - the change is slightly different on linux systems:  In a nutshell, make sure your user id is in /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow or that /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow does not exist.  Also, make sure your user id is not in /usr/lib/cron/cron.deny.\n\nA: The tool I would use to monitor your folders is Hazel. It would be excellent to kick off the script and you might end up using it for many more folders over time as you think of things you could automate.\n", "Q: Can I use DDR3 1600MHz RAM in a Mac instead of 1067MHz? I'm trying to get a 16 GB (2x of 8 GB) RAM to boost my computer, even though Apple says that it's only 8 GB on macs, but we know Apple is wrong on that. However, when I searched the online shopping place, they only have 1600 variants.\nCan I use DDR3 1600 RAM sticks in a 1067 Mac? …and what are the consequences? and when you buy a RAM, does the PC3-8500 things matter or not?\nHardware Specifications:\nMacBook Pro 13″ mid-2010 running OS X 10.9.1 Mavericks\nRunning on 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nCurrently have 4 GB installed (2x of 2 GB) that is DDR3 1067MHz PC3-8500\n\nA: You could add the 1600 MHz memory for your MacBook Pro even though it's designed for a slower memory (1066 MHz) - it ought to work, but you'd be better off buying from a place that accepts returns. Here's some relevant information from Crucial on memory speeds (emphasis mine):\n\nMemory is designed to be backward-compatible, so generally speaking, you can safely add faster memory to a computer that was designed to run slower memory. However, your system will operate at the speed of the slowest memory module.\n\nIn \"DDR3-1600 PC3-12800\"\n\n\n*\n\n*\"DDR3\" is the type (and must be the same as what your computer has)\n\n*\"1600\" is the data transfer rate per second specified in millions (the technical term is \"clock frequency\") - \"1600\" here means it supports up to 1600 million transfers per second - in your case, it will be slowed down to 1066 million transfers per second since that's what your Mac is designed for\n\n*\"PC3-12800\" is the name used in the memory industry - 12800 indicates a peak transfer rate of 12800 MB/s (of course, the actual performance in your case would be brought down to 8533 MB/s, matching PC3-8500).\n\n\nA: Just tried this in a mid-2009 macbook pro. It almost works. If you replace only one slot, everything works fine, since \"your system will operate at the speed of the slowest memory module\", as @MK said. But if you replace both of them at the same time, it will NOT work, since the system will try to operate at 1600 MHz (the speed of the slowest memory module).\nUpdate: Tried it again, but using a different memory, and it did not work at all. It seems that macs are indeed picky. (Both memories were 1600 MHz, 4GB - the one that worked partially was a Patriot, the one that did not work at all was a Samsung).\n\nA: Most new memory uses low voltage 1.2v. Mac before 2013 is still using 1.5V. Your mid 2010 macbook will not be able to support the 1.2V. Issue is not with the speed\n\nA: I bought two DDR3 4 Gb Ram ( 8Gb) crucial mac memory 1600, 12800 Mhz to increase the two 2 GB (4Gb) that came with my Mac book Pro late 2012. I have know 8Gb.\nThe two 2 Gb 1600, 12800 DDR3 Ram Mem that I take out from my Mac book were installed in a Mac 21 Inches late 2009, DDR3 1067, 8500. It works fine and the system tell me that I have installed 1067 RAM me not 1600. No malfunction.\n\nA: Was able to install four (4) mixed serial 8GB SO-DIMMs of Samsung PC3-12800 (1600Mhz) DDR3 SDRAM memory modules (Samsung Memory sticker IDs listed as M471B1G73DB0-YK0 1338 and M471B1G73CB0-CK0 1251) in a Mid-2010 27\" iMac with an Intel 2.93Ghz i7-870 processor. Started up and works without a hitch. Memory under \"About this Mac\" is reported as \"32GB of 1333 Mhz DDR3.\" Therefore, not reported as its native 1600 Mhz. Trick is to make sure the memory you get supports 1.5V as most of the newer memory is lower voltage (eg., 1.35V or 1.2V) that is NOT SUPPORTED by the iMacs older than 2013. Speed is not the issue. So, some people will report Samsung as working, and others will say it does not. Samsung, like Crucial, Elpida, Kingston, Corsair, etc all make good memory, but even the best memory will not work if it is does not support the correct voltage type. Issue is not with higher speed memory which just defaults down to the lower speed that the BIOS supports. In this case, the 1333 Mhz speed is what is reported. So look up the serials on the manufacturer or vendor website that lists the specs and go from there. Also, be aware that this 32GB max is reported only to work with the i5s and i7s, not the i3s or the older Core 2 Duo processors which max out with 16GB Ram at 1.5V setting. \n", "Q: \"control +a\" not working on mac, but \"control + e\" works Today control+a combination stopped working.

But after the minutes, I can see that it consumes almos 50MB of data, so it seems to me that it is using other applications in the background (itunes, system, whatever ...).\nI would like to know how can I force my ipad to only use internet connection for certain applications (mail, echofon) when I use 3G connection, and blocks internet access for all other applications.\n\nA: This is possible as of iOS 7.\nTo disable certain apps' ability to use Cellular Network data, open the Settings.app and select \"Cellular\". Scroll down and you will notice a list of Apps which request cellular data access. These are all on by default.\nThis list is helpful for two things: first, you can see which apps have consumed the most data; second, you can disable certain apps from using the cellular data network. Keep in mind, when you disable that app, it is only preventing it from using the cellular network, and the app will still function normally on wifi. You can now go through and curate the list as you see fit. Even system apps, such as Mail, and Settings, are in the list.\nAt the bottom of the list, you can see another line titled System Services. In there is a list of non-adjustable services that use the data connection. It will tell you how much data has gone to each one. You can use this list to determine if you should make any other changes. For example, Personal Hotspot is at the top of my list. This doesn't surprise me and is fine. However, for you, if it is at the top of your list and you doesn't use that feature, this could be a concern, and you should verify that the feature is disabled. Also, Siri (if your device supports it), and iMessages are in the list. Both of the features can be disabled elsewhere in the Settings.app.\n", "Q: Apple Mail does not seem to connect to my IMAP server I have my own Mailhosting, and am moving servers.

When Thunderbird connects, I can see the successfull login. Apple Mail's activity window and network window shows a lot of stuff as well, but Courier keeps silent. Apple Mail then complains that it cannot connect.

As the title says, is there a Mac app (Mountain Lion) that will allow me to specify a fixed zoom/magnification amount for a specific window, in a specific app?\nI use a particular application (Reason from Propellerhead Software) that does not support any zoom levels for its windows.  One window in particular has lots and lots of tiny little detailed text and buttons in it (the Rack) that is often just way too hard to read, even on a 21\" monitor set to 1024x768 resolution.  \nI would like to zoom this one window, and only this window, to maybe 125% or so of its current size.  I can do this with the built-in Accessibility zoom feature, but then of course that \"magnifying glass\" focus area follows my mouse cursor all over the place.  I would like ONLY that window to be displayed in the zoom area, if possible.\nJust to be clear, this is not about maximizing the window to the screen, but magnifying the visible contents of the window (primarily to make fonts larger).\n\nA: What you ask isn't possible.\nThere are apps that will zoom a portion of the screen - I use the loupe in Xscope for this purpose and it does a very nice job of magnifying the area around the cursor, but it's not able to grab an entire window and zoom it in place.\nThe OS takes the content that the application draws and maps that onto the space where the window exists, so you would need to fundamentally alter the screen rendering on OS X to force an app that hadn't considered zoom levels to zoom only itself.\nUnless you really like Xscope, my guess is you'll get in the habit of zooming the entire screen or possible find another software package to replace the one that won't zoom.\nThe other workaround would be to run that program in a virtual machine and force it to be full screen zoomed in that one OS and keep the rest of your programs running outside the VM. That would accomplish exactly what you ask at some level of time commitment to virtualize the OS and get that set up.\n", "Q: How can I restore photos from an iCloud backup to a new iPhone? My iPhone fell into water and is now broken, completely! I desperately try to recover my photos via iCloud. I downloaded the iCloud manager for Windows since I never backed up my iPhone with my computer.\nIn this manager I can see that I have an online backup file of about 4.5 GB. iCloud is almost full. However, when I check the Photo Stream folder that got created, I only can see about 130 pictures. (I assume the 4.5 GB must be the rest of my pictures.)\nAre my other pictures included in this online backup and how can I get to them, like backup to my new iPhone? Since this one has another ID can I restore only the pictures without messing up the data of my current iPhone?\n\nA: Photo Stream and iCloud Backup are separate — your photos are stored in your iCloud Backup and many of them are duplicated and stored in Photo Stream (unless you deleted them from your camera roll in which case they're not duplicates).\nThe iCloud backup can be restored whole to your device. You can't restore parts of it — it's all or nothing.\nHowever, there is a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your new device to iTunes.\n\n*Reset your device to factory settings and restore the iCloud backup.\n\n*Use Image Capture or iPhoto/Aperture to import the photos.\n\n*Reset your device to factory settings and restore the iTunes backup.\n\n*Copy the photos back to your device.\n\n\nA: Thing I tried that DID work\n1) Did not plug the phone into my MacBook, I used the wall charger only to prevent any iTunes sync activity\n2) Erase all settings and data, restore from the iCloud backup and input passwords in all the pop up windows once it reboots.\n2) Open photos app gallery to see photos downloading and show the progress message \"downloading xx of x,xxx\"\n3) Left it on this photo screen and did not touch the phone at all for the entire restore. I did not close the photo galley/camera roll app once, open any other apps.\nFinally this time round it work and all my photos and apps restored in full. I am going to go back to syncing with iTunes as I don't trust iCloud for restores. It seems that iCloud does not handle photo restores that well, especially if the gallery is large. In short: Wall charger only, restore from iCloud, open Photos app, don't touch. Really hope this works for you too if you've had the same issue.\n\nA: I guess this is what you could do if someone you know could spare you an iPhone for a day or so:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an iPhone and take a backup of the same on your system - use iTunes to do that\n\n*Now (this is really critical and follow it at your own risk) log into your iCloud account on the phone and restore that phone while pointing to the iCloud backup. In this was you will have all of the iCloud data in that phone\n\n*Mail the photos from the restored iPhone to yourself; or use Dropbox (or similar) to sync them off the system\n\n*Restore iPhone from backup taken in step 1\n", "Q: Super simple accessibility app for iPad/iPod Touch My mother is now visually impaired and I've got an old iPad which I want to turn into a \"audiobook station\" for her. However, with the vision problems, operating the Music App turns out to be impossible (also, she's 80+y/o and really not into tech). Also, accessibility options on the tablet were not enough. \nI can take care of keeping the iPad online and feed with new books, but I wish she had at least the ability to play/pause the book at any given moment. For that, would be ideal if the screen were a big simple Play/Pause button she'd simply hit once.\nKind of like Big Button Music Player but hopefully even simpler.\nSuggestions?\n\nA: This list of apps is for the people with low vision or the blind.  There was blind guy I met that was using an app that used sound and voice when he moved his fingers across the iPad.\nhttp://www.applevis.com/apps/ios-apps-for-blind-and-vision-impaired\n", "Q: On external drives When I shop for third-party external hard drives I'm struck by how much more expensive the drives that are advertised \"for Mac\" are, when compared to those without such qualification.\nMy question is: is there a good way to use a \"non-Mac\" external hard drive on a Mac?\n\nA: The 'for Mac' drives usually mean that they've been formatted to be able to be read/write in OS X (therefore almost always formatted as Mac OS Extended). It could also mean that the software that comes with the drive works on OS X.\nTo get a 'non Mac' drive to work in OS X, just Erase it in Disk Utility with Mac OS Extended as the format. You almost never need the provided software.\n", "Q: Contacts has trouble syncing with the Google account. What to do? \nI have Contacts (Version 8.0 (1365)) running under Mac OS X 10.9.1.

I did a lot of googling, but nothing really came up, mostly stuff for other versions of OS X and for the Intel iBooks, not PPC.\nI did eventually come across iScroll 2, http://iscroll2.sourceforge.net, but that says it is incompatible with my trackpad :(.\nDoes anyone know of any other ways I can add the two-finger click functionality?\n\nA: Your computer isn't supported, I'm sorry. I have the same computer as you and I've spent hours searching but nothing exists if your computer does not have compatible trackpad drivers. Ask Apple about getting some new trackpad drivers installed via Live Chat or phone.\n", "Q: Can't open files after upgrading to Mavericks After upgrading from ML to Mavericks (MB Air, 13\", 256GB, 2011) I can't open any file or folder from the standard Open menu from any app (except MS Office -2011). But, I can search for a file (and open it) if it has a label. All the files/folders are greyed out so can't select them, as it can be seen in the attached screen capture (from Preview.app).\nIf I try to save a file, the only place I can do that is in the default folder: if I try to change the folder (navigating through the Save box) I can't save it any more.\nWhat I've done (nothing worked!):\n\n\n*\n\n*repairing permissions\n\n*delete and create a new user (keeping the user folder in /Users)\n\n*updated to 10.9.1\n\n\nIt is worth to point out that this only happens in my user account: after discovering this situation I created a second admin user and everything works fine within it!\n\n\nA: Maybe you could start by moving ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist (where ~ is you're home folder) to the desktop and restart the Finder by typing sudo killall Finder into terminal. If it works with another user, it may be something in you're Library folder that is causing the problem. I would also check you're startup items under System Preferences:Users:Login Items. Another thing that could help is check you're logs in the Console Application and see if it is reporting anything unusual there.\n\nA: As James Payne stated, I did not solve the problem, instead I deleted it by re installing the SO. I couldn't try the solution proposed by njboot because I did it before his/her suggestion.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina 13\": change resolution to 1920x1200 pixels How can I change the resolution of my MacBook Pro 13\" Retina (Late 2013) to 1920x1200 pixels?\nThe MacBook is able to use this resolution! It's e.g. using it, when connecting a second display which uses 1920x1200 pixels and checking the 'mirror displays' option.\n\nA: You can use Retina DisplayMenu, QuickRes or SwitchResX. \n\nA: The built-in display should have a native resolution of 2560x1600.  So it should support 1920x1200 @1.3x.\nYou can use the displaymode command line tool to change the resolution.\nDownload the binary from the \"releases\" section, and extract it if necessary.  Then from Terminal.app, cd to the directory the displaymode file is in.  With any secondary displays unplugged, run:\n./displaymode t 1920 1200\n\n\nA: Although you could do that, I would not recommend to do that. The font and everything else will be very small and it will be hard to read. It also could cause high temperatures on your macbook.\n", "Q: Can I temporarly disable automatic login while booting? Is there a key to press in order to disable automatic login for that single boot?\nI do not want to disable automatic login entirely, I wonder if there is a key combination that, if you keep it pressed while booting, OSX will not automatically login that time only.\n\nCurrent answer is tuned for a previous version of OSX (<10.6), and it should be \"upgraded\" to 10.10.\n\nA: You just need to press and hold the Shift key during the boot ONLY when the Blue screen appears. It will disable autologin and you can choose between your accounts. \n", "Q: Key combination for selecting all the text in an edit buffer? I need combination for selecting all of the text in an edit buffer for an editor like Sublime Text.\nOn the Windows OSes I would use control + a. On OS X this combination seems to moves cursor to beginning of the current line.\nSo how do I select all the text in the buffer?\n\nA: Hahaha. The answer is simple: it is cmd+a\n", "Q: How do I obtain iPhoto for a second-hand Mac Air? I obtained a Mac Air from a friend, second-hand. He restored a clean install of the OS, without the free Apps (iPhoto, iMovie…). These apps were included in the original purchase. We understood that it would be a simple matter of downloading these apps afresh from the Appstore. However, I am required to pay for them. I use my Appstore login, of course, not my friend's.\nI guess one way to get these apps is to go and visit my friend and ask him to log in to the Appstore under his identity, but I would prefer to download these myself. I also suspect that this method may cause problems for a number of reasons: the device is now linked to my login, he probably already has his quota of devices linked.\n\nA: The only legal way to transfer the iLife applications from him to you would be if he had the original iLife installation DVD that used to ship with new Macs. Being that it's an Air, and doesn't have a DVD slot on it, it's unlikely he still has that media.\nUnfortunately, you're stuck with re-buying the iLife applications from the App Store using your own Apple ID. Using his App Store ID to put the software on your Mac and then switching the ID to your account would definitely be on the wrong side of Apple's terms of service.\n\nA: Copy a iLife 11.dmg to usb and install it from there\n", "Q: mac become no sound when after mac sleep Sometime, I close lid, and open again, The sound not available.\nWhen I restart my mac, The sound back.\nIs this a bug?\n\nA: Yes, the same bug I have from time to time, too.\nI could fix it without a reboot by reloading the kernel extension for audio with these commands:\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\n\n\nA: I encountered the same problem.

I downloaded some music tracks from the iTunes Music Store and synced them to my iPhone. While browsing the music on my iPhone, I realized the \"Composer\" field was filled in with the names of the musicians who wrote the songs. However, I only use the \"Composer\" field for classical music, and leave it blank for non-classical music, so I went back to iTunes and deleted the contents of the \"Composer\" field for each track, and re-synced. iTunes showed that the files were being updated, but when I looked on my iPhone, it still had entries in the Music app's \"Composer\" tab. So I went back to iTunes again, and changed the \"Composer\" field for each track to \"Blah\", then re-synced. As expected, there was now only a \"Blah\" composer entry in the Music app. I then deleted the contents of the \"Composer\" field again (in iTunes) and re-synced. Lo and behold, there was still a \"Blah\" composer entry in the Music app! So then I unsynced all my music from my iPhone, and re-synced it—and there's still a \"Blah\" entry!\nWhat do I have to do to get the Music app to recognize that the tracks don't have a \"Composer\" field anymore?! (iTunes must be one of the most frustrating pieces of software Apple has ever made.)\n\nA: I don't understand why this is happening to you. My songs are set up the same way (classical has composer info, others do not) and the transfers are fine back and forth with my iPad and iPod when I edit the Composer field.\nIf you have a Mac, you could try this.\nDrag a music file from iTunes to the desktop. Delete the file from iTunes and your iPhone and sync and make sure it's gone. Then drag the music file back to iTunes (with the iPhone powered down) and edit it. Drag it to the desktop, delete from iTunes and put it back, making sure that all the details are as you want them. Then sync to the iPhone.\n\nA: I have had very similar problems, where a change I make in the iTunes Library does not seem to be recognized by the device I am syncing with. The way I have solved similar problems has little to do with resetting the iTunes Library itself (as you indicate you have done by removing, then re-adding the files to iTunes); but rather with resetting the Library file in the iPhone. To do that: \n\n\n*\n\n*In the iPhone, go to Settings. \n\n*Select General. \n\n*Select Usage. \n\n*In the Storage section, select Music.\n\n*Swipe right-to-left in the top entry, which is \"All Music\" to reveal a Delete button. \n\n*Press Delete.\n\n\nOnce there is no music, re-sync. Also, +1 on calling iTunes the most frustrating piece of software.\n\nA: First of all, make sure the composer not present in the album's metadata. Try changing it there and then try again. If that fails, get it correct in iTunes and do the following:\nMusic syncing is somewhat unreliable for me too, but what works usually is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling music sync alltogether for my iPhone in iTunes (music tab, uncheck \"sync music with this iPhone\")\n\n*syncing the iPhone and waiting for finish\n\n*unplug the iPhone and reboot it (yes, reboot, seriously)\n\n*replug (at this point, no single music file should be on your iPhone)\n\n*re-enable music syncing in iTunes\n\n*hope for the best\n\n\nA: I noticed that after copy files from a NAS to my iPhone, the iPhone was listing lots of tracks with a composer that I could not see in iTunes. Very annoying as I use Composer to sort through classical music only.\nI looked at the tags in Windows and noticed that it has a tag \"Composers\" and that had the relevant info that I wanted rid of. I think Windows Media PLayer (which I was using for streaming from the NAS, decided to put that tag there or something equally unhelpful.\nI suspect that the iPhone respects the \"Composers\" tag i.e. reads it as \"Composer\" but that iTunes does not (it strictly reads \"Composer\".\nI cant face re-adding all the music to the phone again as it took ages to select, so I will copy my music off the iPhone, use a tagging tool to remove the offending tag data and then copy it back again!\n\nA: As far as I can tell, in iOS 7, the Music app will attempt to use the iTunes Music Store to automatically fill in metadata for tracks purchased from the Store. It seems that if you really want to have full control over your metadata, it is best not to purchase tracks from the iTunes Music Store.\n\nA: I prefer only to see classical composers in the composers view.  Only way to make this work on iPhone is to change the non-classical tracks' composer to \"Miscellaneous\" rather than blanking it out.  Anything non-classical will then show under \"Miscellaneous\" composer on iPhone.  Next best thing.\n\nA: If you create an identical copy of the song it will strip the new version of its Composer contents.\nJust make sure the copied version matches the bitrate, kind, etc. for a near identical song.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install flash firmware update without having access to OSX? So I erased my HD and wanted to install Mac OSX Mavericks on my MacBook Air mid 2012 model and after I booted from the USB and was about to install Mavericks the damn thing tells me it can't do so because I first need to install some MacBook Air Flash Storage Firmware Update 1.1 before I can install Mavericks.\nObviously I can't do that since I no longer have any OSX installed and do not really want to download and install Mountain Lion just to install this update.\nIs there a way to run this flash firmware update from the EFI boot/setup section ? Perhaps there's a way to suppress this check for the 'flash firmware' update ?\n\nA: Don't know if this is directly possible. Maybe via the repair partition (press and hold CMD+r after the startup chime) of Os X - assuming that you do not have deleted it to and used Mountain Lion or Lion prior on the Macbook.\nWhat should work but take some time to do so is to install your old operating system and  either than download the flash update and install it and install a „clean“ install of Mavericks after this procedure or just install Mavericks right on top of it via the Mac Appstore.  \n\nA: \"\"press and hold CMD+r after the startup chime) of Os X - assuming that you do not have deleted it to and used Mountain Lion or Lion prior on the Macbook\"\".\nIf this is not possible, you may try the same with CMD+R+Alt(option), in which case it reaches the R partition in internet. But I doubt it, although you never know.\n\nA: Not easily. Apple's firmware updater runs on top of OS X.  Your best bet would be to install a new copy of OS X onto a USB drive and run the firmware updateer from there if you don't want to touch the internal storage. \n", "Q: Will using a temporary travel SIM affect anything on my iPhone? I'm off to Japan for a couple of weeks and wanting to take my iPhone 4 as I need to contact a few people while I'm there.\nIf I use an international SIM to save massive roaming charges will it affect anything on my phone? i.e the apps or notes or anything else? I'll be putting my normal sim back in after 2 weeks.\n\nA: No, it shouldn't.\nYour apps and data are stored on the phone, and changing SIM card won't affect them.\n\nA: WhatsApp or Apps that need to be verified via a phone number would be effected but the majority of all the Apple Apps would be fine. They are all synced with your Apple ID. I would recommend only using iMessage and FaceTime with your Apple ID though so that you can’t be contacted in your temp number. \n", "Q: I believe my ex has an enterprise account.

How can I update it, and unlock it using Ultrasn0w after updating?\n\nA: The first thing you should note is that Ultrasn0w hasn't been supported for a very long time. You should find yourself a \"grey-market\" unlock (on eBay or various other sites) or contact the phone's original carrier (probably AT&T).\nOnce you have your phone factory unlocked, plug your phone into your computer and hold down the Home and Power buttons for about 10 seconds. Let go of the Power button but keep the Home button held down. This places the phone in DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) mode. iTunes will tell you that your phone needs to be factory reset, and you should go through the normal process.

He has Mac OS X version 10.5.8. When we tried to upgrade it the OS reported that there are no updates available.\nWe googled around to find alternative ways of upgrading the system - 3-4 different clicking paths all leading to the same system update program - but with same outcome.\nFinally we tried to download it but we could not find the 10.6 upgrade anywhere. The system does not allow to upgrade to any version higher than 10.6. I'm not able to check it now, but I remember for sure that the computer was bought around 2009-2010, and it is one of these two (1, 2), which should mean that it can be upgraded even up to Maverick.\nHow to upgrade to the latest OS X version?\n\nA: When you say…\n\nI remember for sure that the computer was bought around 2009-2010\n\n…do you mean that the iMac was bought brand new (i.e., the newest model available in stores in the 2009-2010 time frame), or did you potentially buy an older model (i.e., from 2007-2008) in the 2009-2010 time frame?\nBecause you have OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard) currently, and assuming that you never downgraded your OS X, you can narrow down which iMac model you have. Since 10.6 (Snow Leopard) came out in August 2009, and since Unibody iMac [see 1st link in your question] was released in October 2009, it can be assumed that you don't have a Unibody iMac.\nThus, you must have what Wikipedia calls an Aluminum iMac [see 2nd link in your question]. If you are sure you bought it brand new in stores between 2009-2010, it was probably what Wikipedia calls the Early 2009 model.\nEven if all of the previous deductions were incorrect, as long as you are 100% certain that the iMac has an aluminum housing (i.e., the outside is gray, and not white), then even in the worst-case scenario in which your iMac is from Mid 2007, you are guaranteed to be able to install OS X 9 (Mavericks).\nSo rest assured, you can upgrade all the way up to Mavericks if you so desire. I've outlined the steps below.\n\n1. Upgrading from OS X 10.5.8 to 10.6\nYou can up-grade from 10.5.8 to 10.6 by purchasing the installation DVD for $19.99 (w/ free shipping), then up-date 10.6 to 10.6.8, for free using the Apple Software Update application already installed on your iMac.\n2. Upgrading from OS X 10.6.8 to 10.9\nThough it goes against Apple tradition, Apple has (thankfully) released 10.9 for free as long as you have the system requirements to run 10.8; a simple Google search will help you determine that. If you do, then download and install it onto your computer.\n\nA: Upgrade is a major version change. In your friend's case 10.5 -> 10.6 is a upgrade that costs money. You can buy the DVD from Apple or perhaps used. From there, if the machine meets the requirements for 10.6 the process is to run the installer and replace / upgrade any peripherals and software that no longer work. \nFrom there, all upgrades come electronically from Apple. Again, if the hardware is compatible, you can jump to Mavericks to free (though unlikely for most 10.5 era hardware). \nApple also sells Lion and Mountain Lion from the web store if you need an upgrade that isn't the latest and greatest. \nYour first practical step is to go to Apple.com and find in support the article on indentifying your Mac to determine the hardware capabilities before spending any time or money on incompatible upgrades.\n\nA: I have a similar problem.\nMacBook4, bought 2008 or 2009\nAs far as I understood I have to buy the Snow leopard (now I have just leopard) for 18 EUR. After that I am able to upgrade to Mavericks.\n", "Q: Switch to Intel Iris Pro on MacBook Pro under Windows After a successful installation of Windows (Windows Server 2012 R2) on a MacBook Pro (Late 2013, 15\") I've noticed that only the Nvidia graphics card is recognized in the device manager. So I've tried to install setup.exe from the folder IntelHDGraphics64 which I found on the installation disk created with BootCamp, but I got this error:\n\"This computer does not meet the minimum requirements for installing the software.\"\n\nSame error message was thrown when I tried to install the latest drivers from Intel directly.\nI even tried to install the drivers manually, but this didn't work either.\nNow I would like to know whether it is even possible to get the Intel Iris Pro graphics card running on a MacBook under Windows and then switch between them to increase battery life when I don't need high graphics peformance.\nI am using the Mavericks version of BootCamp assistant and have the retina model. \n\nA: I know this is not the answer you want to hear, but unfortunately there is no way to disable the discrete GPU and use the integrated graphics, when using Bootcamp.\nThis has been discussed (to death) on support forums and on the web generally.\nI have thought myself in the past, that it would be useful to be able to turn off the discrete GPU just to improve battery life on the laptop. But Apple have not provided a driver capable of switching off the discrete GPU, so there is no way of doing it.\nSorry to be the bringer of bad news - who knows, maybe they will provide that functionality in the future?\n\nA: Whilst possible with Windows 8, it's not a task for the faint hearted.\nThere's a guide here:\nhttp://forum.techinferno.com/implementation-guides-apple/8717-%5Bguide%5D-enabling-intel-iris-pro-hd5200-win8-1-15-macbook-pro-gt750m.html\n\n\nA: Even thought it's a rather old thread, it's still one of the first that come up if you are searching for I-Gpu and MacBook Pro.\nIn any case, it seems that it is possible to activate the igpu on windows, by following this guide: \nguide 1\nguide 2\nWhat you are basically doing, is spoofing the system thinking that you are booting on MacOS while you are booting on windows. It seems that it's mostly an issue on people that are interested on using an egpu on windows, but it was also a problem for anyone that doesn't work the battery to last for like 2-3 hours when using windows because of the dedicated gpu running all the time. \nI have successfully installed it on my computer and is working without any problems.\nCheers.\n\nA: It's not that you can't disable the GPU, you can, I have to do it because my graphics card is failing (2011 iMac). It's that there is no other option but the default graphics driver provided by Windows (VGASave). I would be fine with that option but VGAsave only has a few resolutions, and it stretches them to fit your screen. Again I have used it for a while without the stretching (just has black bars) and it is a thousand times better than VGAsave. I'm sure it would not be overly difficult to implement a non-stretched alternative. \nI know it's hard to think of Apple's philosophy being bad, especially since it is the same philosophy that has bought so many good things. But it's obviously because they want you to have the best performance all the time.

I restored my iPhone 5 with iOS 7 without knowing that iCloud account will be asked. I already forgot what email and password I set on that phone.\nNow, after the phone was restored and unlocked but no application can be used. I don't know what to do. When I connect it to iTunes, it keeps on asking for the iCloud email and password.\n\nA: Since you can not bypass the activation lock itself, you need to contact Apple and get control of that account. If you are the original purchaser of that hardware, you might also be able to get them to reset the lock with proof of purchase and identity. \nThe website https://appleid.apple.com has instructions on resetting your iCloud password if you do not remember it. \nYou can retrieve the email by erasing the iPhone from iTunes when the device is in normal recovery mode and you will be prompted to enter the password for the email account. Also, if the device is not locked, go to the settings app and look in iCloud for the AppleID that has locked that device for firer activations. \n", "Q: Inbox empty using OS X Mail with outlook.com account (IMAP) I set up my outlook.com account with the OS X (10.9.1) Mail app using IMAP, pretty much as suggested in this link except that the latest mail app has no option to keep the account offline before it is created.\nThe connection to outlook.com appears to be fine, as my sent items, junk, etc. folders are all populated with up-to-date mail, and I can send mails from the account, but my inbox is completely empty.\nI've tried a bunch of suggestions such as deleting the pertinent mailbox folder from ~/Library/Mail/V2 and also the EnvelopeIndex files from MailData to try and force a rebuild of the mailbox, but it seems these are to no avail.\nNot sure if this info will be of help, but in the menu items the Get New Mail and Rebuild commands are greyed out for this account too.\nIt seems like this is a common enough problem, but none of the solutions I've seen work for me. Anybody got any ideas?\n\nA: I've faced the same problem trying to set up my wife's Hotmail account in Mail.app. After much fiddling I eventually gave up and used POP3 instead.\nAbout the only suggestion out there that I didn't try was trimming down the inbox (she had, I believe, 3k+ emails in her inbox), since some people reported solving the problem by getting their inboxes down to, say, 100 emails or so. I didn't even bother trying that solution since it seems so fragile -- what happens when she receives new email above the magic threshold that breaks IMAP? Is it just going to break again?\nMuch as it pains me to say this, it appears POP3 is the way to go for Hotmail/outlook.com/etc. accounts. IMAP appears to be simply broken.\n", "Q: How to open an app on login on secondary screen? Several apps I use are set to \"Open at Login\".

If I use Find my iPhone to list devices from my iPhone, all 3 devices show up, but the old iPad shows offline. Is there a way of checking what devices have access without asking her obviously?\n\nA: No, unless she is using your Apple-ID this will not be possible.\nAs your old iPad appears offline, this probably is not the case.\nYou can delete your old iPad from the Find my iPhone app in order to tidy up the list, this won't disable any Apple-ID on her iPad though, should that still be on there.\nIf you reset the device though and didn't set up the iPad with YOUR Appe-ID then you're good to go.\nAlso: notice that when a new device starts using your Apple ID, Apple will send you an email notifying you about that.

I have 2 Mac Servers, each of them set to be an OD Master, but are looking to a Sun LDAP server as well.  The same user has a different value for the NFSHomeDirectory value when doing a dscl read on the user with LDAPv3/My.LDAP.Server .  I assume this means that some of the info provided is coming from a local OD DB or a cache or something, otherwise it would be exactly the same on both servers when querying the same datasource (my LDAP server).\nQuestion:  Where is the NFSHomeDirectory value stored?  OS X Lion (on one server and 10.5.8 on the other)\n\nA: You need to check the mappings being used on the various servers. The program for looking at/configuring this used to be in /Applications/Utilities and named \"Directory Access\", then at some point it got renamed to \"Directory Utility\", and then (I think later) got moved from Utilities to /System/Library/CoreServices.. but I don't remember where it was & what name it went by in version 10.5. You'll have to look for it in both places.\nAnyway, run Directory Whatever, click the padlock and authenticate, double-click the LDAPv3 service, select the config for the Sun LDAP service (there should be two configs listed, one for the local OD master, and one for the Sun service) and click Edit, then select the \"Search & Mappings\" tab.\nThere should be a pop-up menu near the top labelled something like \"Access this LDAPv3 server using\". If \"From Server\" is chosen, it's getting its settings from a config record on the Sun LDAP server. Everything bound with this option should be getting consistent mappings & therefore the attributes should match on all Macs.\nIf it's not in \"From Server\" mode (which it probably isn't, given it's a Sun server): find Users in the left column (\"Record Types and Attributes\" if the name hasn't changed since 10.5), click the disclose triangle next to Users, select NFSHomeDirectory under that, and see what's mapped to it (listed in the right column).\nCompare what you find on the various OS X servers; if I understand your setup at all correctly, this should tell you where the difference is coming from.\nEDIT: Having the OS X NFSHomeDirectory attribute mapped to the LDAP homedirectory attr is entirely normal. The naming conventions here are hopelessly confusing: the OS X HomeDirectory (note caps) attribute contains XML-wrapped instructions on how to mount the home directory, and the OS X NFSHomeDirectory attr contains the local path it should have (after being mounted), which matches exactly with the standard (RFC 2307) LDAP homedirectory (note lowercase) attribute. If the home directories are mounted via NFS, it's generally ok to have the OS X HomeDirectory attribute blank.\nI'm not sure what happens if there are multiple home paths; my guess would be that it'll use the first and ignore the rest, but I don't really know.\nTo see what server is queried first, check in Directory Whatever, in the Search Policy section under Authentication. I'll search the various data sources in the order that they're listed here. Note that OS X does not handle identity conflicts at all well, so having users with the same account and/or full name, or the same user ID number, in multiple domains is a really really bad idea. If you have multiple accounts with any matching identifiers, OS X tends to merge all of their attributes in unpredictable and confusing ways. In a situation like yours, I'd tend to keep all users in just one of the LDAP services (probably the Sun server), with only the per-domain \"diradmin\" account in each of the OD master's domains.\n", "Q: How do I use OS X Print/Save as Postscript to produce a custom sized page? I am trying to produce a press-quality CMYK PDF file from a Pages or MS Word document in OS X.  The canned Print/PDF options produce insufficient quality in the images, and do not allow conversion to CMYK.  I was following a recommendation to use Save as Postscript, and then Adobe Distiller (which I have on a separate, Windows machine) to get the right results.  It all works great EXCEPT that I need a custom page size.\nWhen I use PDF/Save as Postscript, it produces a US Letter size document, irrespective of the Page Size settings in Pages or in MS Word.  In this case, I need to produce an 8.75 x 11.5\" PDF (required by the publisher to support their workflow.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: After noodling on this question and worrying that my google-fu had atrophied, I sorted out something that works.\nEdit the generic PPD file provided in Mac OS X to add the desired page size.  I found the generic PPD file here:\n  /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Frameworks/PrintCore.framework/Resources/Generic.ppd\nFollow the directions here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1028891/whats-the-easiest-way-to-add-custom-page-sizes-to-a-ppd to figure out what needs to be added.  (Thanks, SO).  In my case, the lines added were (they are non-contiguous in the file, just look to see where they go): \n*PageSize LetterEx/US Letter Expanded: \"2 dict dup /PageSize [630 810] put dup /ImagingBBox null put setpagedevice\"\n*ImageableArea LetterEx/US LetterExpanded: \"18 18 612 792 \"\n*PageRegion LetterEx/US Letter Expanded: \"2 dict dup /PageSize [630 810] put dup /ImagingBBox null put setpagedevice\"\n*PaperDimension LetterEx/US Letter Expanded: \"630 810 \"\n\nEdit the generic PPD file to set the new settings as the Default in each case.  This seemed to be necessary in make case to get the desired PS output.  Note these are also non-contiguous in the file, but just replace them where each *Default occurs.\n*DefaultPageSize: LetterEx\n*DefaultImageableArea: LetterEx\n*DefaultPageRegion: LetterEx\n*DefaultPaperDimension: LetterEx\n\nReboot the system.  For whatever reason, my attempts to restart the printing system/CUPS/whatever didn't take.\nInstall a new printer, type IP, IP address = localhost or 127.0.0.1, and specify the Generic Postscript Printer type.\nFrom your application (in my case, Word or Pages) do Print, select the 127.0.0.1 printer, select the Letter Expanded page size for your target document page size, and then do PDF/Save as Postscript.  It appears that the Postscript conversion engine silently makes use of the current printer profile when producing the PS, rather than the application's page size settings.\n", "Q: Finder can't recognize USB drive When I put in a USB drive, VMWare asked me if I want to connect it to Mac or Windows, and the USB drive shows up in Disk Utility, so I can confirm that the USB is not broken and USB port is also working.\nBut I can never find the USB drive in Finder.\nIn Preferences, I checked everything so external drive can be shown in Finder.\nWhat's wrong with this?\n(I use MacBook pro 15\" Late 2011, OS X Mavericks)\n\nA: You could try finding the drive using Terminal. If you're not hip to Terminal commands, the way to access your USB via the command-line is\nOpen up Terminal, and enter the following commands (hit return at the end to execute):\ncd /\n\nThis will take you to the highest level folder on your computer's hard drive. Then, type:\nls  \n\nThis will list everything there. You should see an entry there called Volumes. Now go into the directory and list its contents:\ncd Volumes\nls\n\nThe USB's name should be listed, since you said DiskUtility sees it.  \nFrom there, you can browse the stuff in your USB, and use open [filename] to open things.\nOtherwise, you might want to copy everything off of the drive and reformat it. That fixes most problems.\n\nA: If the drive works fine in other Macs, try other USB ports on your Mac. Certain models of MacBook Pros have some odd USB port behaviors.\nIf the drive works fine on other OSes (Windows, Linux, etc) but not on your Mac or any others, then the drive may not be formatted properly.\nIf the drive works fine on your Mac if VMWare is not running, then there is a configuration problem (I don't run VMWare personally).\nIf the drive previously worked on this Mac, but no longer does, and no longer works on other computer either, then it has either failed or its filesystem is corrupt.\nIf none of that helps, please post a screenshot from Disk Utility while the drive is plugged in.\n", "Q: How does iPhoto synchronize photos between my macbook pro and my wife's one?

You can disable it in Virtual Machine -> Configure -> Shared Folders.\nThese folders can be safely deleted if you don't care about their contents.\n\nA: The shell running in Terminal uses $ to identify variables. So if you want to remove or edit (or reference in general) a file whose name contains a $ you need to protect/escape it\nrm -r \\$RECYCLE.BIN\nvi SYS\\$OUT.txt\n\n\nAs the variable $RECYCLE most probably didn't exist, the variable got replaced by \"nothing\" in your case resulting in\nrm -r .BIN\n\nbeing run. This still doesn't fully explain what happened though because all you should have gotten is a rm: .BIN: No such file or directory error.\n\nA: $RECYCLE.BIN is a hidden folder on Windows systems. It's the Recycle Bin, as you may have guessed. Did you by chance use this disk in a Windows machine at some time? That would explain how it arrived on the disk. Since it's in your Downloads folder, it's more likely that it was accidentally included with a .zip file that you extracted.\n\nA: Since it is in your Downloads folder I would bet it was in a poorly compressed file.  It could have been compressed with the Note.txt file.\nI get the Thumbs.db files all the time, it is created by Windows when it makes the thumbnails and is not removed during compression like hidden files should be.\n", "Q: How can you do two-way Dropbox <--> local folder syncing on iOS? On my iPhone, I sync my camera photos with Dropbox, so that after I do a photo shoot all the photos are automatically uploaded to my laptop in the Dropbox 'Camera Uploads' folder - ready to sort, edit and delete as necessary.\nI now need to be able to do two-way syncing with the iPhone, so that when I delete (or even modify) a photo on the computer, it's also deleted (or modified) from the iPhone's camera photos folder accordingly; this way I'm not left with dozens of 'dud' photos that I no longer want on my iPhone, despite having already deleting them on the laptop. \nThe official Dropbox mobile client doesn't allow two-way syncing, so until they introduce such a feature, this can only be possible via a third-party dropbox API-using client.\nOn Android, I could do this with Dropsync, with many features and full sync customization. Is there an equivalent Dropbox solution for this on iOS?\n(I am aware of the idea that iCloud may do two-way syncing built-in, (though am not sure), but I'd like to be able to share the Camera Uploads folder with family members on Windows computers (and even linux), and so find Dropbox a much more multi-platform-friendly service to use for the syncing and collaborating, instead of the iCloud ecosystem.)\n\nA: Unfortunately, I'm almost certain there's no equivalent Dropbox solution for this currently on iOS.\nWhile I cannot give you a technical reason why two-way syncing on iOS is not possible, I can say that at a high level, the iOS platform is more guarded in terms of allowing developers to access certain capabilities of the device.\nAs you stated in your question, Android devices are capable of two-way synchronization through apps like Dropsync; this is because of the relatively more open-ended nature of the Android platform for both developers and users. To read more on why this is the case, read the 'Android Offers an Open Platform' section of this article.\nTo confirm, I contacted two customer representatives of two data-sync companies: Loom and SugarSync. I asked both reps the following question:\n\nIs possible for two-way synchronization of files between an iOS device and a computer? For example, if I sync pix from my iPhone to my iMac, and then edit/delete the pix on my computer, will the changes be reflected automatically on my iPhone?\n\nBoth times, the answer was:\n\nNo, this is not possible due to the closed nature of the iOS platform.\n\nIf this capability is very important for your work, I would suggest migrating back to an Android device.\nIf you want/need to use your iPhone for this, and if you need a platform-independent solution (i.e., you don't want to use iCloud), I'm afraid tedium is in your future. I would suggest that you keep a list of the photos as you edit/delete them on you computer, so that you know which photos have been updated and need to be manually re-download from Dropbox (or manually deleted) on your iPhone when you use it next. \n\nA: If you're willing to jailbreak, you can use iFile to two-way sync a folder in /var/mobile with a folder in Dropbox. It can't do background two-way sync, but you can do it manually.\n\nA: I know Documents by Readle supports two-way sync with Dropbox and other cloud services on iOS. I use it all the time sync books from my computer and iOS devices. \n", "Q: Jerky internet on MacBook Pro My wifi works fine on all other computers/phones/tablets; however, it's very jerky on my MacBook Pro.\nIt used to work fine, but began being jerky a couple months ago. Nothing has changed, but it's like the internet just locks up every few seconds, then jumps right in and starts working again.\nAny ideas on what's causing this?\n\nA: Here's a few things you can try...\nFirstly, (as a test) try moving closer to your wireless router until you are along side it. If the dropouts reduce, there may be something interfering with the wifi signal (especially if it is on the 2.4Ghz band - which it probably is). Have a think about what you might have transmitting on this frequency... Cordless phone, baby monitor etc. If you have either, try switching them off.\nLoad safari and visit www.speedtest.net\nAs you run the speed test, watch the graph.\nThis will at least give you a visual interpretation of the problem - but not actually fix it. You should be able to 'see' the data transfer stopping & starting - thereby verifying your problem.\nTry also searching for FREE network analysis tools on the App Store. Have a look for NetSpot, Network Strength & more.\nThe one I use is called Wifi Analyser (in the Mac App Store, and the Android Store, but by different people I believe) - The Android version displays the signal strength of your wifi (and close neighbors) as you walk around your house (or where-ever) in a graphical format. Maybe the problem is a very weak signal ?\nLastly, maybe the problem is not the wifi at all... Perhaps there is some other software running in the background chewing up all of your processing power?\nRegards, Greg.\n", "Q: Screensaver after morning wake I would like the screen saver (which shows family photos) to launch each morning when the computer wakes in the morning.  I used the Energy Saver option to sleep the computer each night and to wake it each morning.  But instead, each morning I find a blank screen and am forced to login to start the screen saver.\nI am wondering if someone can recommend a way for the screensaver to start automatically each morning, without needing to login.  This is for a computer at my (elderly) parents house where they love to watch the photos, but don't quite understand why they would need to log in to see them each morning. \nThe only solution I have is to completely turn off energy save mode and leave the computer/screensaver on in perpetuity.\nIdeas?\nSystem = iMac 27/2013 with OSX 10.9.1 (also 10.8)\n\nA: It looks like running the following command in Terminal, or supposedly through a script, will start the screen saver:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine\n\nYou could then schedule the screen saver to run a couple of minutes after the time the computer is scheduled to turn on.

It is currently on version 5.1.1 (9B206).\n\nA: There's no harm applying the available updates to your device, as only compatible updates are shown.\nThe latest iOS version supported by 4th generation iPod Touch is 6.1.5 you mentioned. After the update, there shouldn't be any available updates to apply.\n\nI use the original iPad as an example.

Finder was probably bugging (again ...). \n\nA: I do this all the time .. but have noticed recently that it takes a bit longer for the cursor to grab the photo or graphic on some sites. \nIn Safari, using Open Image In New Tab from the contextual menu will give you an even easier drag from that tab, the actual link to the photo ... and it's size!\n", "Q: How to start using an inherited iPhone? My relative died and I inherited her iPhone. Her number was disconnected. Can I get a new phone number and a SIM card from a store? How can I start using this phone?\n\nA: You may be limited in your choice of carrier, but as you surmise, the thing to do is visit a store. If the phone was locked to a specific carrier, you may need to get your plan from the same carrier, particularly if your preferred carrier is a CDMA carrier like Verizon. If you prefer to use a GSM carrier, the carrier can provide a SIM card and should also be able to unlock the phone from the previous carrier. (Provided, of course, the phone in question has a SIM card slot. I believe the original iPhone 4 did not if it was on Verizon or Sprint.)\nThe other caveat is that if it was running the iOS 7 software and your relative turned on the activation lock feature, you will not be able to use the phone until you gain control of her Apple ID. Going to visit an Apple Store may be able to help with this.\n", "Q: Font Book says multiple copies are installed I downloaded a free font that included four .ttf files for the Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic variants, all different. I dragged them into Font Book and they all appeared in a group, but the three variants other than Regular were flagged as duplicates:\n\nMultiple copies of this font are installed.\n\nIf I choose Resolve automatically all variants except Regular are shown as Off. If I right-click and enable these variants, ignoring the multiple-copies message, I'm still not able to use all the variants in TextEdit or Photoshop (the only apps I've checked in so far).\nWhat's going on with this font? The previews in Font Book look exactly as I expect them to (rendering as the proper variants).\n\nA: Have you, first of all, looked in /System/Library/Fonts, in /Library/Fonts, and in ~/Library/Fonts to see what actually exists ... as opposed to depending on software to tell you. \nI expect that both Photoshop and TextEdit fonts behaving properly depends on the Mac default fonts - and fonts commonly used by those (and other) apps - being in the correct location.\n\nA: Sounds like your Apple devices are impacted by the SIP. \n\nwere flagged as duplicates\n\nOur Macs, identical and eventually worse. All those verify and resolve automatically methods, useless. Our windows devices suffer the VSS, ugly (don't ask)! Your SIP situation unattended will worsen, in part reappearing across macOS reinstallation, as remembered system behaviors are.

The power button is a completely different circuit and separate cable from the top case to the MLB. (That is with the model information you have provided). You can use CTRL + Eject to bring up the sleep, shutdown, restart dialog box but there is nothing else for starting the computer up unless you set up a energy saver setting which boots the computer up at a set time.\nIf the button is damaged in such a way, please recommend your friend either contact AppleCare or an AASP and get his top case replaced.

I have a screen protector from Tech Armor designed specifically for the iPad Air but it covers a small, barely visible port or opening of some sort near the front camera. \nI thought it was a microphone at first but upon further research, I don't think it is since the two mics are on top and back. \nIs it just a light sensor perhaps and therefore doesn't matter that it's covered by a clear film?\n\nA: It is the Ambient light sensor (ALS).\n\nIf Auto-Brightness is on, iPad adjusts the screen brightness for current light conditions using the built-in ambient light sensor.\nQuoted From iPad User Guide For iOS 7 (October 2013) P.23\n\nAdditional information: Quora: Where is the Ambient Light Sensor located on the iPad\n", "Q: How to get rid of booby-trapped pop ups to update flash player? I'm coming across a malicious pop up to update my flash player. The message in the pop up:\nWarning! Your Adobe Flash Player version is outdated. Security risks. Please update now.\n\n\nI've seen this pop up across multiple browsers (chrome, safari, firefox) and occurs on all OSX machines on the local network. I've attempted to disable on plugins and extensions in chrome but the problem remains. Clicking ok takes me to a website that appears to be an official adobe website but the link to download the update is clearly wrong.\n\nThis problem just happened today across three machines simultaneously and I'm stumped as how to proceed. What's the best way to remove these pop ups?\n\nA: When weird things happen on my clients' Macs, the first thing I do is run the free Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware (MBAM, formerly AdwareMedic software to see if any of the known \"bad guys\" is active on the system. As often as not, they are.\nAlso, have a look at your /etc/hosts file through Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Utilities > Terminal (or use Spotlight)\n\n*more /etc/hosts (press space bar to scroll a screen at a time)\n\n\nSee if fplayer.adobe.com is listed there. If so, we'll discuss how to remove it.\nTry that and report back.

I restarted my phone and lost my jailbreak tweaks. As my phone restarted the Cydia icon was still on my phone.\nI went into settings and erased my iPhone. I saw the Apple logo and then it went into a black screen with a spinning circle. It's been on it for almost an hour. What can I do in a situation like this?\n\nA: Resetting a jailbroken iOS device using the option in settings will cause no end of bad things, usually resulting in a device stuck in a boot loop, which appears to have been the case here.\nYou'll have to restore your device in iTunes. Connect your device to iTunes, then hold power and home until the screen turns off and back on with the Apple logo, then let go of power but keep holding home. Once the device appears in iTunes, restore it.\n\nA: Put your iPhone into DFU mode:\nOpen iTunes and connect your iPhone. While it's stuck on the apple logo, hold down the power and home buttons until the screen goes black. As soon as this happens, hold down the power button for three seconds, then the power and home buttons for ten seconds, then release the power button and continue holding down the home button for 15-20 seconds. (all this while connected to your computer). iTunes should tell you that your iPhone is in recovery mode, and you need to restore it.

Simply sign in with your Apple ID (e.g., personal.email@example.com) and purchase or download the app you wish from either the App Store or the Mac App Store.\nProduct registration helps Apple pull up your details quickly and easily should you (or your family) need warranty service. It's not at all required and the warranty of any Apple product is bound to the actual device, not the person. If you purchase an item from the Apple Store, you'll notice that your warranty already starts on your product purchase date. If you buy an item from a 3rd party retailer, you will have to bring in the original receipt to show date of purchase. We often lose or forget about receipts, so registering your product is often convenient for us as well as Apple.\nIf you purchase content using your own private Apple ID, that content is bound to your account. If your family ever wish to update an app, or redownload it, they will need access to your Apple ID account.\nThere is nothing that technically forbids you from using many Apple IDs on a single system, but often tracking who bought what gets to be a bit of a pain, especially when someone moves on. Just of note that it's often best to keep things simple and use a single Apple ID. It's important to remember that you can't transfer purchases from one Apple ID to another. You also can't ever close or delete an old Apple ID. When an Apple ID is created, it is quite permanent.\n\nA: Yes, it should work fine, and won't transfer the registration of the Mac mWhen you purchase something, enter your Apple ID instead of the family one and the purchase will be completed by your Apple ID instead.\n", "Q: How to keep MacBooks keyboard and trackpad functionality when using Windows on Bootcamp? Before installing Windows 7, I used to work with Mac OS X on my MacBook Pro. After the installation I noticed that the functionality of the keyboard and trackpad changed. I really want to keep using Windows 7 and the default/old keyboard and trackpad functionality as in Mac OS X.  \n\nA: Do you have Apple's bootcamp drivers? You should be able to go into Control Panel > Bootcamp and change your keyboard/mouse settings there...\n", "Q: Unable to select and highlight on Preview in OSX Lion I've been trying to highlight my pdf notes on preview, but am unable to select or highlight a single sentence. When I try to highlight, it just shows the chosen highlight colour on the whole page, then when I let go of the mouse button, it just disappears. \nI've followed all the usual methods of selecting the annotation tool and also the highlight button option but am still unable to do so. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: PDFs are just a wrapper for various kinds of content.   Depending on how the PDF was created the text might be selectable.   A lot of them have the text stored as graphics and in that case you wont be able to select/copy/highlight it.   I suspect PDFs also allows the \"protection\" of content so that viewers cannot select and copy bits of text.\nWhere did you get the PDFs if you can track the source you can change how they are created.   If it was prom a scan it will normally be a picture.   Utilities like PDFPen etc.  allows OCS of Scans.  If you do that the text will become selectable/highlightable.\n", "Q: Upgrade my MacBook Pro I want to upgrade my existing MacBookPro to the current one in the market. Is it possible to upgrade the hardware configuration, like RAM, HDD.\n\nA: For comparison, this is the spec for your machine. The current non-retina 13inch is the mid-2012.\nIt's not possible to upgrade your machine to be the equivalent spec of the current one. e.g. the CPU can't be upgraded, the more recent models have Thunderbolt etc.\nHowever, you can upgrade the RAM from 4GB to 8GB, and you can replace the HDD with a much faster SSD.\nThe SSD will make a big different to the performance of the machine and the memory upgrade is almost certainly worthwhile too.\n\nA: Laptops, especially Apple laptops, are generally designed using the best components and technology available at the time. So, in order to fully upgrade your MacBook to the current model, you'd need to trade up and buy a new MacBook. This is especially true now that all componentry is being soldered to the logic board, to save space, make room for the battery, and greater use of solid state memory.\nThe 2010 MacBook Pro gives you at least a few options of varying difficulty. RAM is the easiest to get to, and is detailed here on Apple's support pages. Your MacBook \"supports\" 8GB of RAM, in that your machine has two SO-DIMM slots, and when the system was designed, the highest-density modules available were 4GB--but, it should actually be capable of using 16GB of RAM, since 8GB modules are now available (memory speed is backwards-compatible, and OS X has no problem addressing this much memory).\nThe Hard Drive is pretty much the only other accessible component, and it is a bit more difficult to access than the RAM, so do make sure you know what you're getting into beforehand. You won't get a performance increase from upgrading your HD unless you cross-grade to an SSD, which might actually be less capacity than what you have now.\nIf you're really feeling adventurous, OWC will sell you a DIY kit to actually replace your optical drive with a second HD or SSD. Rumor has it you could even use this to build your own Fusion drive in your MBP setup, for the best of both worlds in terms of storage capacity and speed.\n", "Q: How to get 1080 HD videos from itunes? I have changed both settings in iTunes to download 1080 HD videos but for example I just bought Beyonce's visual album and the videos are like 88MB, which is not HD.\nPlease help\n\nA: Glad to see you know about those settings because they are a bit hidden in my opinion. To answer your question, the music videos are in the quality they were published by Sony Music Entertainment (in this case). Music videos haven't gotten the same amount of TLC like films and TV shows. In music videos, video quality hasn't taken a priority as much as sound quality so most companies decide that it is important for a lot of music videos to fit on a devices as fewer high definition videos. Looks like most music videos are standard definition (sub 720p) and it will probably stay that way until 16 GB devices go out of style.\nWho knows, maybe by then there will be a simple option to download HD versions of previously purchased music videos. Sorry for the bad news but I wanted you to know that you aren't doing anything wrong.\n", "Q: How to find just deleted files in Time Machine? I am going through many old photographs on my Mac, deleting duplicates that have occurred for one reason or another.  However, I realise that I may have deleted the wrong duplicate in some cases.  I have deleted several hundred duplicate photos, across multiple folders.\nI have my whole hard drive backed up in Time Machine.  However I don't want to simply restore all the files in Time Machine for my photos folder since I have made some changes since doing the deletion that I want to keep.  There are too many files involved to hunt for them in Time Machine individually.\nIs there a way I can identify the files in a folder in Time Machine that do not exist in the current filesystem?

I enjoy watching P2P live streams (Flash) on my iMac and I would like to be able to do the same thing on my iPad. I have tried Puffin Web Browser, but the streams that I would like to see are covered in pop-ups with hinky links. On the iMac these will disappear when I go full screen, but within Puffin I can't click that full screen button.\nHowever, I also have VLC for iOS installed. Is is perhaps possible to watch a P2P live stream via VLC? (I tried Open Network Stream and paste urls there, but that didn't quite work. Perhaps don't know how to pick the right url?)\nCan you recommend a set-up?\n\nA: Puffin Web Browser is not always great for button-like functions within flash content. However, for most flash videos Puffin Web Browser has a \"Theater\" mode. So in Puffin Web Browser go to the live stream that you would like to view, and wait for it to begin to play. Now, instead of attempting to click the full screen toggle within the player that is showing you the live stream, swipe from the right edge of your screen to bring up the sidebar, and press the \"Theater\" button. Your video should now be playing in full screen, or as close to full screen as it is going to get. If you really prefer not using Puffin Web Browser, the only version of VLC that fully supports P2P video is the version available on Cydia. If you like stable devices, that is not recommended.\n", "Q: Why do Apple bloggers use Skype or Google Hangouts instead of iChat for video podcasts? I enjoy a few \"talking heads\" type of video podcasts by Apple bloggers. How come they don't use iChat? Doesn't iChat have group video conferencing or are there technical (as opposed to social) reasons to prefer skype over iChat for producing a video podcast?\n\nA: *\n\n*Awareness\nMany people know what Skype is — not many know about iChat in comparison. As soon as someone says 'video conference' the immediate response by many is 'Skype!'\n\n*Familiarity\nMany of the older video podcasts use Skype because that's what they started with. Familiarity is very important with people that make video podcasts for a living. They see no reason to switch because Skype works well for them.\n\n*Plugins\nThere are a number of plugins made for Skype for recording the call, etc. This means that for those that use Skype they'd have no reason to switch to iChat since their favourite plugin isn't available that works with the rest of their equipment.\n\n*Livestreaming\nMany video podcasts use Google Hangouts because of its ease of use for livestreaming it as well. Google Hangouts can be livestreamed with practically no preparation or equipment and then immediately made available on YouTube after, which is perfect for many.\n\n*Number of People\nGoogle Hangouts can hold many more people than iChat/Skype, which makes it perfect for large events.\n", "Q: Can one stream photos to Shared Photostream from Finder on a Mac? I know someone who is considering the possibility of setting up an iPad as a digital photo frame. Ideally, they would use Shared Photostreams to easily put pictures on the device. This is easy for any live-updating of the iPad photo frame, but the challenge comes in with the photo archives taken with a standard DSLR camera.\nThere are many photos, then, that they would like to easily stream from their Mac computer. Because they don't have a lot of extra space on their computer for a large iPhoto library, is it possible to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manage multiple small iPhoto libraries easily, and if so how would they do that?\n\n*\n\n*Right now a number of the photos are on SDs cards. Could they basically convert each SD card to an iPhoto Library and then use that to stream?\n\n\n*Is it possible to post to a shared Photostream from a Mac Finder window?\n\n*\n\n*This would absolutely be ideal. A 3rd party app would be fine. I picture something like the standard right-click -> Share.\n\n\n\nA: You can use iPhoto to add to a Photostream from your Mac.\nI have Aperture using mine so I cannot fully test it with iPhoto without switching it off in Aperture. But is should work the same way by importing the images into iPhoto which also allows you to organise them. \nAnd then using the Share feature to share to iCloud. ( photostream )\nThe share with iCloud startup dialogue in iPhoto:\n \n\nYou can have multiple iPhoto libraries and open any of them as the Library to use by holding down the option/alt   ⌥  key when Launching iPhoto.\nYou should get a dialogue similar to this:\n\nThis means you should be able to import a SD card to it's own Library\nAlthough it maybe easier to just organise within iPhoto and a singe Library\n\nWhen selecting an image in Finder. The Share contextual menu does not offer up iCloud. So it looks like no with Finder at the moment\n\nA: I would recommend Aperture…\n\n\n*\n\n*Tethered Shooting\nYou mention that the photos would be taken with a standard DSLR. If it's one of the Apple verified cameras (see Apple KB: Aperture 3: Tips on tethered shooting) or many others unverified, then the photos can be automatically imported as they are taken, and therefore automatically shared through Photo Stream.\n\nThis won't prevent the photos from being able to be shared through a Shared Photo Stream later if required.\nAlso, the files can be stored in a location of your choosing, therefore accessible through Finder if required.\n\n\n\n*Multiple Libraries\nYou can break down a large library into smaller ones really simply, and switch between them on-the-fly.\n\n\n", "Q: Pages '09 flags file as modified after printing I'm using Pages '09 with Mountain Lion (10.8.3).\nEvery time I open a file to just print it and don't make any modifications, Pages '09 flags it as modified.\nIf I just want to close ⌘+W this file, and to be sure I didn't make any unwanted modifications, I get this window:\n.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first choice makes me think I made an unwanted modification.\n\n*The third one is inappropriate if I didn't made modifications.\n\n*The second choice bring me back to the same state: document to close\nand next the same warning window.\n\n\nIs there an easy way to suppress this irrelevant warning window in such\na case, i.e. when I didn't made any modification and such a warning window is neither necessary nor usefull.\nIs this bug fixed in any recent version of Pages?\n\nA: Since the file is being modified, there's no way to suppress this.\nYou can notify Apple that you would like this feature implemented using their Pages feedback page:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/pages.html\n", "Q: Invoke Perl script in Windows from OS X I have a Perl script written in Windows and an AppleScript written in OS X. I want the AppleScript to invoke the Perl script that is residing in Windows. How can I do this?\n\nA: Assuming you have access to the file from your Mac system, for example through a shared folder, you would run it locally (through Terminal) like this:\nperl /path/to/windows/shared/folder/scriptname.pl\n\nIn AppleScript this would be something like:\ndo shell script \"/usr/bin/perl /path/to/windows/shared/folder/scriptname.pl\n\nHowever, this still executes the Perl script from your local Mac instance.

Currently, I am using a Samsung Omnia W and mostly I am using my 2013 MacBook Pro's USB port for charging it.\nIs it fine for charging the battery in the mobile phone? Sometimes, I have received a 'high power consumption' warning (from USB port) on laptop as warning.\nWhat is the power output of the USB port compared to the mobile's input power for the battery?\n\nA: Apple computers and displays without USB-C ports will strictly adhere to USB standards for all non-Apple hardware, so you will be limited to 5 V at 500 mA for charging your Samsung phone. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4049\nThird party chargers or wall adapters will be needed if your device is requesting or using more than 500 mA since Apple will shut USB ports that exceed the spec and are not Apple to Apple. \nAlso, this USB over-current condition is safe, expected and like a modern circuit breaker, you unplug the device and reset the circuit except for USB on Mac, the reset happens immediately when you unplug the offending device. Unless your device has a sync only setting, you'll need a special USB cable to sync and have to charge it elsewhere than from your Mac. \n\nA: This is a superb question and has come across my desk and under my nose many a times. \nIf you are getting a \"High Power Consumption\" message then do NOT use that device with that computer. If you don't get the message with your MacBook Pro while plugged into the wall then you should be fine. \nI am also going to use this platform to mention something that I see happen again and again. Using a device or cable that is not authorised or gives power consumption warning messages can cause the SMC of the main logic board to go haywire in such a fashion that it will no longer start up or shut down in the middle of use.\nThe only way to resolve that is a hard SMC reset and that is too much trouble. Avoid it if you can, charge with an AC adapter for your phone for best results.\n", "Q: Attempting to share a video in iMovie '13 results in error -50 I have updated to iMovie '13 (v10.01.0) and can no longer share my videos to Vimeo or export them. I get the following error message:\n\nVideo rendering error: -50\n\nWhy is this happening and what can I do to fix it?\n\nA: That error isn't the most helpful, but you can do several things to rule out some easy problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Export onto a different drive - plug in an external with at least 10 GB of space assuming your movie isn't more than 20 minutes long.\n\n*Change the size and try re-exporting to your disk.\n\n*Open the console app and search All Messages for iMovie errors and post them if they are not clear to you on next steps.\n\n\nA: This may be because some files in the editing process may be corrupted.

Is there a way to get a confirmation whenever a file/folder is moved or deleted in Mac to prevent this till i get more used to the trackpad?\n\nA: You might want to set yourself up a Standard User Account in System Preferences. Or maybe better is removing some of the multi-touch abilities in your System Preferences (such as disabling Tap to Click, Look up, or any setting you don't find particularly to your liking)\nSetting up a Standard User (System Preferences > Users & Groups > \"+\" ) allows you to add a new person to your computer who doesn't have access to everything like a normal Administrator does. \nIn computer terms the hierarchy is Guest, then Standard, then Administrator, then Root. The Root is the computer itself and can do anything and everything it wants. Admins have similar flexibility with files and folders that belong to them but anything out of their reach requires a password. Standard accounts and Guests can do much with an Admins name and password, Guest files are typically deleted after logging out so what they do isn't meant to last.

How can I separate mailboxes completely in Mavericks's Mail application?\nI don't want any of this integrated inbox/folders with the same name feature. I just want clean/separated mailboxes with their folder structures. Its nice for people who have few accounts and small number of mails. It is not a \"smart feature\" when you get 135,000 messages of inbox/sent/archive folders from 18 different boxes mixed in 3 folders.\n\nA: Not sure if you still have this problem, but this confused me too.\nI have been using Sparrow during Mavericks. After upgrade to Yosemite I decide to give the native mail.app a try.\nIt looks good, but I was confused that it seem when adding multiple email accounts, it will show the structures, like folders, labels, etc in separate, but has a together inbox, which I dislike.\nI believe Apple shouldn't do something this stupid (While sometimes they did...), but anyway I checked everything in the preferences but can't find a clue.\nFinally, I found the way they do it....\nWhen you adding multiple account, You still get the separate inbox and sent box and junk boxes for each account.\nIt is just been grouped together...looking for the small arrow at the left most of Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Junk, Trash and Archive, after expanding them, you will find your account.

A tty is 'inactive' only when its idle time exceeds the system sleep timer. (value = 0/1)\nRegarding another solution:\n    sudo pmset -a lidwake 0\n\nAccording to the man page, the lidwake only takes a laptop out of standby.\nlidwake - wake the machine when the laptop lid (or clamshell) is opened (value = 0/1)\nIf doesn't say anything about staying awake when the lid closes\nIf the lidwake setting actually does work for you, you will likely NOT want to use the -a flag because sometime when you are out and about, you will kill your battery becuase your laptop will not go into standby.\nUse the -c (charger) flag instead.\nsudo pmset -c lidwake 0\n\nFinally, type the word caffeinate on the command line and that will prevent the laptop from going into standby for as long as the terminal is open or the command is running.\n\nA: Nope, there's no such setting in OS X.

The person seemed to experience the same problem under OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.3). Maybe these steps will do the trick for you, too.\n\nPlease read this whole message before doing anything.\nThis procedure is a diagnostic test. It’s unlikely to solve your problem. Don’t be disappointed when you find that nothing has changed after you complete it.\nThe purpose of the test is to determine whether the problem is caused by third-party software that loads automatically at startup or login, or by a peripheral device.\nDisconnect all wired peripherals except those needed for the test, and remove all aftermarket expansion cards. Boot in safe mode and log in to the account with the problem. Note: If FileVault is enabled, or if a firmware password is set, or if the boot volume is a software RAID, you can’t do this. Ask for further instructions.\nSafe mode is much slower to boot and run than normal, and some things won’t work at all, including Wi-Fi on certain iMacs. The next normal boot may also be somewhat slow.\nThe login screen appears even if you usually log in automatically. You must know your login password in order to log in. If you’ve forgotten the password, you will need to reset it before you begin.\nTest while in safe mode.

In a perfect world Airplay mirroring would display identical results compared to an HDMI cable. In other words, the frames per second, resolution, and image quality would be unaffected by the use of Airplay compared to using traditional means. \nWhat are the current limitations of Airplay?\nCan I stream a 1080p movie through Airplay onto my television (through Apple TV)? \nCan I play a first person shooter through Airplay without lag?\nAssume a powerful 2013 iMac. \nI would appreciate any information related to frames per second, resolution, image quality, bandwidth, lag/delay, and what factors are associated with these limitations. \n\nA: The Apple Developer documentation for AirPlay, specifically the HTTP Live Streaming section, has pretty detailed information about it. Depending on several factors, I summarize the following:\nResolution max. recommended high profile encoder settings, for a 16:9 aspect ratio over wifi:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dimensions: 1920 x 1080\n\n*Total bitrate: 40000 kbps\n\n*Video bitrate: 39000 kbps\n\n*Keyframes: 90\n\n\nFramerate A frame rate of 10 fps is recommended for video streams under 200 kbps. For video streams under 300 kbps, a frame rate of 12 to 15 fps is recommended. For all other streams, a frame rate of 29.97 is recommended.\nThere is tons of more info, but in short, the specs say: \"Yes!\" you can stream a 1080p movie through Airplay. And there are several examples of \"Airplay-enabled-games\", like first person shooters, that work just great. \nHowever, the crucial factor will be your wifi network as this will determine your lag/delay and -probably- most limiting factors. So there will be a significant delay on any 802.11N based wifi network. And therefor, there will be lag with latency-sensitive audio/video interactive purposes, like games. For movies, it should be no problem though.\nSummarizing: The limitations of wifi transfer speeds isn't near to your perfect world when connected through a cable.\n", "Q: For Mac OS X, what is required for HDCP (video copy-protection) on an external monitor with HDMI? I have a (non-Retina) MacBook Pro (mid-2012) and I have just purchased an Asus VN248H-P external monitor with HDMI input, connected to the MacBook Pro with a Monoprice Mini-DisplayPort to HDMI cable. This is not a television set; it is a peripheral computer monitor.\nFor the first time, I tried to play a movie purchased and downloaded from iTunes on the external monitor, and I got an error message in iTunes saying that this is not supported because the Mac cannot verify HDCP support for my configuration. (This refers to the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection encryption scheme).\n\n\nThe selected movie won't play on one of your connected displays.\nThis movie can be played only on displays that support HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection).\nTry moving the iTunes window to a different display. Make sure the entire window is on the supported display.\n\niTunes will only let me play the movie on the built-in screen on my (non-Retina) MacBook Pro, which is smaller and lower-resolution.\nIs my Monoprice cable incompatible, and do I need to replace it with a different cable or adapter? Is there such a thing as a cable or adapter that works with HDCP and will enable this? Or is playing HDCP-encrypted content simply not possible on my configuration?\nPlease don't give me an answer that involves using software to break the HDCP encryption or to transcode to a different video format; I'd like to know if there is a hardware solution for full compatibility so that I don't lose any video resolution by transcoding.\n\nA: The answer is that I seem to have encountered a bug in the implementation of dual displays in Mac OS X 10.9.1 Mavericks.\nIf I am using both the internal display and the external display at the same time, without using \"Mirror\" mode, then iTunes will not permit playback of the iTunes HDCP-encrypted movie on the external HDMI screen.\nHowever, there is a workaround: if I close the MacBook Pro's lid, disconnecting the internal display, so that the MacBook Pro is only driving the external display, then iTunes will play the HDCP-encrypted movie on the external display over HDMI, in full-screen mode -- although iTunes still displays the same error message saying that it can't play back! \nThis is quite inconvenient, because I want to use both displays at once, without Mirror mode, at all times, so, for example, I can have Apple Mail and Microsoft Word up and running on the internal display while I'm watching the iTunes HDCP movie on the external display. \nIt looks as if I can further work around this bug, by first starting iTunes, then closing the lid, then starting the movie in iTunes on the external monitor, then raising the lid on the laptop again to activate the internal screen, then continuing to use other applications on the internal screen while the movie continues to play in iTunes on the external screen.\n", "Q: macbook doesn't recognize internal HDD, only when connected via USB yesterday something weird happened. After my 13' macbook pro ( early 2011 ) was running all night while playing music, in the morning I just closed it and went home from my friends house. When I got home and opened it, it just froze completely, so had to shut it down with the power button. After turning it back on, it just showed me this folder with a question mark. When I tried to do internet recovery, I couldn't, because no HDD was visible. So I couldn't do anything at all, even in DISK UTILITY computer wouldn't show any disk at all. So I took the lid off and disconnected my HDD and put it in enclosure and connected it to my macbook via USB and booted from there. It booted perfectly fine, as nothing happened.I did time machine back up just in case something will go wrong again. SO, basicly it will boot from USB but not when the HDD is actually inside my macbook. Any advice ? I read some forums and it looks like it could be HDD's controller that failed, disconnected HDD's power source, disconnected HDD's date cable,SMC, NVRAM, or PRAM need to be reset, the drive's indices are corrupt, a logic board problem exists .. Just wondering if anybody had similar problem and could give me some advice. Another thing, my macbook was overheating a lot and after I opened it, there was quite a lot of dust. \nAlso I want to ask, if I will buy a new HDD ( looking at Seagate Momentus XT 750 GB ), can I get it all look like my old system. Do I just plug in my time machine disk ? Sorry I am not very good at this technical stuff. Thanks a lot for any help.\n\nA: It's probably the flex cable that connects the hard drive to the logic board. Some of the cables inexplicably went bad in 13\" MacBook Pros--happened in my 2009 model. A new cable for my model was $9-$11 for the part at an Apple Store, and I got the tech to waive the labor charge since the part was so cheap. Looks like the cable for the 2011 models is $50 on ifixit (http://www.ifixit.com/Store/Mac/MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-Unibody-Model-A1278-Early-2011-Late-2011-Hard-Drive-Cable/IF163-026). Not a difficult repair at all if you're already out of warranty and would rather do it yourself, but use a nylon probe tool (black stick, can also be purchased from ifixit or elsewhere) to disconnect the battery from the logic board first and then carefully remove the cable connector from the logic board--don't want to break the logic board side. \nAs far as overheating goes, the system will shut itself off or put itself to sleep if it gets above a safe operating temperature. If fans are running all the time, it could be something software related (runaway process, web video, CPU/graphically intensive app). If the fan and outtake vents are blocked with dust, could also be a lack of airflow. You can use compressed air (only hold the can upright) to blast out the dust when the bottom cover is off. Or if you take it to an Apple Store just ask the tech to clean up the dust. \n\nA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amg5w0rlwDo\nI changed my HDD to SSD at the same time as following James' advice, and had to reset the PRAM (start while holding CMD-OPT-P-R) before the new SSD would boot while connected to the internal SATA cable (repaired with insulation tape) - before I did the reset, it would only work while connected via the USB.\n", "Q: How do I rotate a movie on the iPad/iPhone? I have a movie in my camera roll that is incorrectly rotated.  I would like to rotate it 90 degrees to fix the problem.\nUsing this tip I was able to rotate the movie using iMovie.\nHowever, the problem is that the movie is now cropped incorrectly.  The movie is stuck in a landscape orientation instead of a portrait orientation, so that the bottom part of the movie is now cut off.\n\nHow can I rotate a movie in iOS while preserving its proper aspect ratio and dimensions?\n\nA: I don't have any experience with this app but it seems like it will do what you are after: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-rotate-free/id626614962?mt=8\n\nA: On OS X After rotating your movie in iMovie, click the crop button (in adjustments) in the upper left. You should have a green dragable box inwhich you can resize. \nCrop button may be in different place per device. \nOn iOS Tap the clip you want to crop. When a magnifying glass appears tap on it. From there you should be able to pinch with two fingers to adjust the frame of the video. This is per latest iMovie update.\n\nA: Following up on @FlippinFun's answer, since I don't have a high enough score to comment.\nOn iOS, using iMovie: Import the clip into a new project, THEN tap the clip you want to crop. A magnifying glass will appear on top of it. You can just put two fingers on the clip, and rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise.\nThis works in iMovie for iOS 2.0 (791), and likely earlier versions of iMovie 2.0 for iOS 7.\nYou can find a detailed description of this in the \"detailed help\" within the iMovie app.\n\nA: Disclaimer: I have the iMovie app installed\nI had a vertical video I wanted to edit in the iMovie app, but it kept saving it as a horizontal 1920x1080 video, so I needed it rotated back to a vertical 1080x1920 video.\nHere's what I did:\n\n*\n\n*Go to the video and click \"Edit\"\n\n\n\n*Tap the three dots\n\n\n\n*Choose iMovie\n\n\n\n*Use two fingers to perform a rotating gesture in a desired direction.

In Chrome, this page renders the following infobox:\n\nIn Safari, this same excerpt renders as following:\n\n\nA: Wikipedia is not directly using the HTML5 audio tag (which it should be) and is not supporting media in Safari at this time (likely due to it's lack of popularity) so It's recommended to use Chrome (which is basically safari that Google improved upon) or Firefox.\nexample page:\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Libre_music\ndocument.querySelectorAll('audio').length\n0\n\nThe \"compatibility\" layer (mw.PopUpMediaTransform) they are trying to use makes the audio tag after you click play but in safari it tries some java applet that breaks.\n", "Q: Fast CD ripping on old MacBook Pro, slow ripping on i5 PC? I'm ripping my entire music collection into ALAC, as it's the best solution for quality and compatibility across all devices in our household. In order to speed the ripping process up, I have iTunes installed on my PC and Apple laptop with the same ripping settings (ALAC, error correction enabled), with the aim to merge the two local libraries later. The issue I have is, the Windows PC is extremely slow compared to the laptop, despite having the power advantage.\nAny ideas what could be causing this?

I installed Pages version 5 on Mavericks via the \"App Store\". But the problem is Keynote and Numbers are installed also.\nI'm not interested in Keynote and definitely not in Numbers. I want to uninstall them. On Google, some people say use AppCleaner and others say don't use it because it will do harm.\nSo how to uninstall Numbers and Keynote (the right way)? \n\nA: I recommend you just delete Numbers and Keynote using Finder.\nThe Mac App Store will detect the missing apps and allow you to reinstall them in the future if you ever need them.\nAlternatively, you can use AppCleaner to delete them. This will remove all associated preference/cache files. This is usually superfluous unless you have an actual need to delete the preferences. They're not doing any harm leaving them there.\n", "Q: Streaming video pauses with bluetooth I have an iPhone 4S and an LG LBS-700 bluetooth headset which I used to use a lot to watch streaming videos on my phone. I haven't watched any in a while - possibly since before iOS 7, but I'm not sure - and in the last week or so started again, and I'm finding that the video will run for about 5 minutes or so, and then start pausing every 1-3 minutes or so, for about 10-15 seconds each time, before picking up and playing again... a couple of minutes later, another pause, etc.\nThis does not happen when I am not using the Bluetooth headset. It also does not seem to matter what the source of the streaming video is; I've tried Netflix, Amazon and Plex Media Server; they all exhibit the same behaviour.\nDoes anybody know why this might be happening, and what can be done about it - aside from \"don't use Bluetooth\"?\n\nA: To me it sounds like the Bluetooth device is experiencing a firmware issue when trying to communicate with the device running on iOS 7. I'd try either putting fresh install of iOS 7 on your iPhone, or getting in touch with LG. It's most likely an error on their part.\n", "Q: How to sort contacts by creation date or modification date in iOS Contacts or OS X Contacts 7.x? Is there a way to view or export the date a contact was created or modified in iOS 7 and/or the Contacts app (version 7.1) when viewed from a Mac? \nThis one datapoint would enormously aid deduping and syncing, even in a more manual way.\n\nA: After digging a little bit in Contacts' DB here is what I found. \nAs already said by @grgarside, the DB is in \n~/Library/Application\\ Support/Address\\ Book/Sources/<source-ID>/AddressBook-v22.abcddb\n\nWhere <source-ID> is most likely the most recent modified directory. \nAddressBook-v22.abcddb is a SQLite DB file with 24 tables (in my case). The most important one is ZABCDRECORD which holds (among others) the firstname, lastname and the creation date of the contact (but also modification etc). \nThe 2 interesting columns in your case are : \n\n\n*\n\n*ZCREATIONDATE\n\n*ZMODIFICATIONDATE\n\n\nAs I found out recently, the base date for these 2 columns is 01-01-2001. \nThe columns ZMODIFICATIONDATEYEARLESS and ZCREATIONDATEYEARLESS  use the 1st January of creation year as the base date. \nUsing sqlite you can sort it like that : \nsqlite3 AddressBook-v22.abcddb \"select ZFirstName, ZLastName from ZABCDRECORD order by ZMODIFICATIONDATE\"\nIt will output FirstName/LastName sorted by modification date. \n\nA: The Contacts database is stored in a single SQLite3 database. You can find yours here…\n~/Library/Application\\ Support/AddressBook/Sources/<source-ID>/AddressBook-v22.abcddb\n\nThis can be exported using\nsqlite3 AddressBook-v22.abcddb .dump > ~/Desktop/export\n\nSince the result is a single file and created/modified dates don't appear to be stored in my database, the only way to sort by date is by comparing various versions of the file.\nYou can use Time Machine to grab older versions of the file and FileMerge (a developer tool) or other comparison tool such as Kaleidoscope to compare the result.\nIf you want to look through your iOS database, either jailbreak or sync your contacts to your Mac.\n\nA: Try something like that if you want to sort by Create date and see the date:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Navigate to AddressBook-v22.abcddb\n\n*Sqlite3 AddressBook-v22.abcddb \"select datetime(ZCREATIONDATE,'unixepoch'), ZFirstName, ZLastName from ZABCDRECORD order by ZCREATIONDATE\"\n\n\nA: Adding onto the answers here (I still don't know how to add a link to a comment) - if you wish to do this once, then the shell scripts would suffice. If you wish to do it on an ongoing basis, you might think about using a product - I use SQLiteManager, but it's pricey, except when on sale. There are a number of free and web-based SQLite managers out there. These apps (like SQLManager), should have the ability to order by any column. I find this very useful, not just for contacts, but any SQLite database. Here is an example of a SQLite Firefox extension.\nFor reference, if you want to see SQLite databases that apps use, find the app in Finder (~/Music/iTunes/Mobile \\ Applications, copy it to your desktop. Change the suffix to zip, and double-click. Be careful. Control-click the .app file, and if the developer didn't mind, the sqlite file will be at the top level. I use this facility to test my apps when they go live, or when the OS changes.\nIf you choose to stay with scripts, maybe someone else can provide the specifics, but I believe you could create a script that not only copied the contacts - I suggest - read only - but then paste them into Numbers or equivalent. Then, you would also have the ability to sort by column.\n\nA: If you just want a quick way to view contacts sorted by creation date, there are a few apps that do that. For example, https://itunes.apple.com/tc/app/recent-contacts/id541831736?mt=8.\n", "Q: Bulk SMS App for iPhone on Schedule A friend who runs a spa wants to send out a reminder to all her customers four weeks after their last appointment. It is a small number, half a dozen per day. But I need an app that can send an sms to a group of customers that a separate program generates. (Separate program runs on a PC, phone is an iPhone.)\nDoes such a think exist?\nI know I can use an SMS gateway for this, problem is that when the message goes out, the reply has to come back to HER phone number. So if the message says \"Would you like to schedule an appointment\", when the customer his reply they want to say \"How about tomorrow at 12pm?\" and that go to the spa onwer's phone. SMS gateways don't seem to be able to do that reliably. So I wanted to go through the phone directly.\nAny other suggestions to achieve the same goal would be appreciated.\n\nA: You'll have far better luck doing this on Android as opposed to iOS due to restrictions on sending SMS from applications is something that's not even kosher for App Store apps AFAIK.\nThere are SMS providers that allow voice and SMS from the numbers - you can check out Twilio for that. Also Google Voice offers SMS to email, so your business could switch to using that and use an email program to queue the SMS for bulk delivery as required.\nSorry to give you a no answer, but there just isn't a market for this sort of app to run natively on iOS.\n\nA: Maybe try https://groupme.com/.

However it didn't work for me and just doubled the keybinding for minimize. \nI did find, that setting something else to CMD+M worked perfectly:\n\n\nA: You don't need to install any additional software.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n*Click the  button below \n\n*Enter \"Minimize\" (use \"Minimize All\" to override minimizing all windows with ⌥⌘M) into the Menu Title text input field.\n\n*Assign some bizzare key combination that you won't press by accident.\n\n*Repeat steps three and four for \"Minimise\" (alternate spelling) which is required for some apps.\n\n*Close the window to save the changes.\n\nI'm aware that this is not really \"disabling it\" but the result is effectively the same and without depending on 3rd party software.\n\nA: macOS 10.12 (Sierra):\nThe accepted answer didn't work for me. But setting the CMD-M mapping to a different action worked right away:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n*Check off the Show Help Menu item and\n\n*assign it a CMD-M key combination.\n\nNot a perfect solution, but still much better than minimizing the window accidentally.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is to install a key remapper (I use KeyRemap4MacBook). Though the name seems to suggest otherwise, currently KeyRemap4MacBook actually works with all Apple computer products that can run OS X 10.4 or later, including iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro.\nUsing this method, you can map ⌘M, which OS X maps to the minimize function by default, to Fn+⌘M, which is significantly harder to accidentally press, and which OS X maps to no functionality by default.\nIn other words, you can swap the functionality of these two key combinations so that ⌘M no longer has a functionality and is essentially disabled. While it is not strictly \"disabling\" the shortcut, this workaround achieves the same effect.\nUse the following steps to disable the minimize shortcut in Mavericks:\n1. Install KeyRemap4MacBook\nDownload the appropriate .DMG file from the link above and double click it. If you get a message like this:\n\nYour security preferences allow installation of only apps from the Mac App Store and identified developers\n\nThen open the System Preferences program already installed on your computer and, under the Personal tab, select Security & Privacy. Next, under the General tab, click the lock in the lower left corner to make changes (provide an administrative password if needed), and under Allow applications downloaded from: label, select the Anywhere radio button.\nNow you can install the application; you may need to restart once it's finished.\n2. Configuring the custom settings\nWhile KeyRemap4MacBook offers a diverse collection of useful features, disabling the minimize shortcut is not among them. Instead, it provides a handy XML file that you can modify using their API to achieve almost any key remapping you can think of.\nOpen KeyRemap4MacBook, and navigate to the Misc & Uninstall tab. Under the Custom Setting label, click the Open private.xml button. Make sure the document opens in a plain-text editor such as TextEdit. Once opened, you should see a blank XML file with empty root tags. Replace the entirety of its contents with the following code snippet:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n    <item>\n        <name>Disable Minimize</name>\n        <identifier>private.disable_minimize</identifier>\n        <autogen>\n            __KeyToKey__\n            KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L,\n            KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L | ModifierFlag::FN\n        </autogen>\n        <autogen>\n            __KeyToKey__\n            KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L | ModifierFlag::FN,\n            KeyCode::M, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L\n        </autogen>\n    </item>\n</root>\n\n[Note: The previous code uses the left-most command key. If you are interested in disabling the right-most command key, change each instance of COMMAND_L with COMMAND_R.]\nSave the private.xml file. Return to the Change key tab. In the main list, under the remapping label, you should now see a Disable Minimize checkbox.\nCheck the checkbox, and you should now no longer be able to minimize your windows with the ⌘M shortcut. If you ever need to use the shortcut again, use Fn+⌘M, or simply uncheck the Disable Minimize checkbox.\n\nA: macOS 10.16 (Catalina):\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Accessibility\n\n\n*Enable Invert colors shortcut\n\n\n*Assign Command + M combination\n\n\n*Disable Invert colors shortcut\nProfit!\nmacOS 12.5 (Monterey):\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n\n*Add all following shortcuts with different bindings under All Applications:\n\n*\n\n*Minimise = Cmd + Ctrl + Opt + Shift + 9\n\n*Minimize = Cmd + Ctrl + Opt + Shift + 8\n\n*Minimise All = Cmd + Ctrl + Opt + Shift + 7\n\n*Minimize All = Cmd + Ctrl + Opt + Shift + 6\n\n*<Your Localised Names for these commands> = Cmd + Ctrl + Opt + Shift + 5, 4, ...\n\n\n\n*Switch from System Preferences to any other application (Cmd + Tab)\n\n\n*Go to Menu bar > Window > check new shortcuts are in effect\nProfit!\n\nA: In 2023 on macOS 13.2, the answer suggested here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/73957/330523 worked perfectly - and it's much easier to script so that you don't loose the setting if you move to a new machine:\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Minimize' '\\0'\n\nRemember that the change only applies to applications that have been reopened (or after system restart). Maybe that is why it didn't work for you?\n\nA: I disabled Mission Control in \"System Pref>Shortcuts Tab>Mission Control\" by unchecking checkbox Mission Control in the column and then Cmd-M would minimize any app open instead.\nSo, using \"Keyboard Maestro\" I creating a \"Do Nothing\" Group and assigned Cmd-M to \"No Action\" as in screenshot.

I'm using Facebook on iOS 7. When I send a message, my location is included, and the prompt tells me how to turn it off permanently: Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services and turn it off for Facebook. But Facebook doesn't appear as an app in Location Services. So, how do I prevent Facebook from accessing my location?\nTo be clear, the question is not about whether Facebook includes my location in messages. It's that I don't trust Facebook itself to access my location.\n\nA: Indeed @cksum appears to be correct. I just tested this on my dev device that's never had Facebook installed. The app said that it knew my location and showed the blue location icon, but didn't show in the list of apps in Location Services.\nI pressed 'send' and got the 'Facebook wants to use your location' message, which I accepted and now the app is in the list and allowed me to switch it off.\nIn conclusion, yes it appears that Facebook doesn't request the actual location data until you press send, at which point the app is added to the list in Settings.\n", "Q: How to set an iTerm2 startup command How do I set a command on a profile so that when I start a new terminal window, it fires off that command.\nSpecifically, I'd like to be able to set my virtualenv with:\nworkon ENV\n\nSo that it starts automatically into my virtual environment when that I use that profile.\n\nA: Using the image to illustrate, please note the command selection and Send text at start: option.\n\n\nA: In iTerm2, preferences>profiles>tab general, there is an option in Command called send text at start that executes any command you put there after login.\nIn particular, I typically have\nsource ~/.virtualenvs/.../bin/activate\n\nfor profiles that use Python.\n\nA: Profiles -> General -> Command\n\nEverytime you open a new tab your bash profile will be sourced.\n\nA: Got it, there is an option added in the development branch of iTerm that adds a \"Send text at start\" option to the profile settings.

It has been jailbroken in the past and I haven't really used it since. And now I decided to upgrade it so I restore it to factory settings, except there is a critical issue. The device claims that there is no SIM card inserted into it. I tried with multiple SIM cards and bought a new one too, just in case, and the phone continues to give the same message. I am locked in the screen in which the iPhone is to be connected to iTunes. For Apple servicing, I need the index number, for which I need to start the phone and go to Settings, but this phone is completely locked. I tried re-inserting the SIM many times but there seems to be no change. So far I have done the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the language\n\n*Country of usage\n\n*Choose a WiFi network/ connect to iTunes. \nAnd that's all. \n\n\n\nThis question is similar to one asked before, but I have tried the tape as well and it lead nowhere. And I don't have an AT&T SIM.\niPhone stuck at \"No SIM card installed\"\n\nA: No one has responded, and with the information you've given, it is difficult to know exactly. But I would guess that while jailbroken, the device was also unlocked, and when you restored factory settings, you lost the unlock, and now the iPhone is once again locked and expecting an AT&T SIM. If you can acquire an AT&T SIM, and it works, then this will be confirmed.\nHowever, this is a rather common issue with a very simple solution, and perhaps my hypothesis is wrong. \nSorry it took so long for a suggested solution! \nAnd Happy New Year!\n", "Q: App was rejected for use of protected 3rd party material My app has been rejected due to 3rd party material clause:\n\n8.5: Use of protected 3rd party material (trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, otherwise proprietary content) requires a documented rights check which must be provided upon request.\n\n1, What is documented rights check composed of \n2, How do I offer it up to Apple so that my App is approved.\n\nA: There are several avenues you can take to resolve this. The first is to log into the developer center for your iOS developer account and go to the Resolution Center and verify that the reason is correct and see if they have identified specific assets (music, artwork, code that could reasonably be protected by copyright in the US.).\nThere is an App Review board, but I wouldn't rush to that as it's kind of a final step and you'll want all your ducks in a row if you go that route.\nIf you really have no clue what parts of your app might be problematic, you can use a support incident and ask Developer Technical Support to point you to the specific items that are problematic and flagged by the reviewer. My guess is you will have a good idea and can substitute a royalty free drawing or song to resubmit the app and confirm whether the items you suspect being flagged for rejection are the actual items.\nAt that point, you will need to decide if you want to push things and use the assets and somehow justify why copyright material isn't in your app or get approval from the copyright owner and submit that evidence to Apple.\nYou could also ask the reviewer to send you the list of assets so you can start the rights check documentation. Depending on the issue they see, it could be a simple letter from your lawyer to something much more involved if Apple has had previous legal requests from copyright holders and you have run afoul of that with your recent review denial.\nAll of the above would be most applicable if the app contains assets that were flagged. If your app during testing consumes or downloads other copyright material, you may need to have a more direct discussion with Apple to understand if you are even going to be allowed to distribute your App through Apple's storefront.\nWorst case, you can request clarification of the rejection from https://developer.apple.com/appstore/contact/\n", "Q: How to make custom footer section stick to bottom of page in Pages 5?

There are like 2-3 instances of the same albums with different number of pictures. For example \"Album A will have 200 pictures\" and as I scroll further down I see another instance of \"Album A\" but this time it only has 197 pictures.\nI thought that this could be the iPod Photo Cache issue as I use iPhoto to sync some albums onto my iPhone and iPod Touch. I followed the steps to remove the iPod Photo Cache from iPhoto (Show Package Contents) but this has not helped.\nSo I decided to do a clean restore of all my photos. I unsynced all albums and removed all pictures. And then I resynced it again with the albums which I wanted. This seemed to fix the problem temporarily. The albums will sync properly at first but I see a \"Restoring\" at the bottom of my photo album after clean up.\n\nAfter about 30-60mins the Photo Albums will revert to the old way with doubles and triples of my albums.\nI'm not sure what this error was and I keep trying to go to settings and see if there are any backups of my Photos. But I have switched off iCloud sync of photos etc.\nIf anyone could help me and point me in the right direction to fix this I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: I was looking further into this and I found out that on my Macbook Pro's System Preferences. In the iCloud settings, the \"Photos\" setting was checked and in the Options next to that, the \"My Photo Stream\" and \"Photo Sharing\" was also checked.\nI think this was the main problem. After I used iTunes to sync with the photos maybe there was some cache settings or something residual left on the iPhone which let to it being continuously restoring.\nThis is the fix which I used. It is fine now.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check in System Preferences for - iCloud >> Photos is unchecked.\n\n*Check in System Preferences for - iCloud >> Photos >> Options >> \"My Photo Stream\" and \"Photo Sharing\" is unchecked.\n\n*Temporarily delete account for iCloud settings on iOS device - Settings >> iCloud (This didn't affect my main iCloud account only deleted my information on the device)\n\n*Re-sync iOS device with iTunes.\n\n*Set up your iCloud account on iOS device again.\n\n\nHope this helps for anyone having this problem.\n\nA: I've had the exact same problem with my iPhone 4s. I think my problem also started after I updated to iOS 7, when I noticed that albums contained the wrong photos (photos not included in albums created in iPhoto).\nI also tried deleting the iPod Photo Cache, and (in iTunes) choosing to sync photos from an empty folder on my iMac. And I also turned off iCloud streaming options on the iPhone, but to no avail. After synching with iTunes, I would see \"Restoring...\" in the Photos app, and after a couple of hours my 15-gig library of photos would reappear, with albums containing incorrect photos. This happened even when the phone was in airplane mode and not connected to my iMac, so I'm not sure where the photos were coming from.\nToday I finally decided to use iTunes to restore the phone (following Apple's instructions: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1414). After connecting to iTunes, I first did a backup of the phone to the iMac, then used the 'Restore' button. After iOS 7 was reinstalled, I restored the backup I had just made. I was leery of doing this, in case the backup was corrupted, but I didn't want to start from scratch. \nIt turns out this fixed my problem. The 15-gig library no longer tries to restore, and I've started putting back some albums, and they seem to contain the correct photos. I wish there was something else that worked, but a backup and restore seems to fix the problem. The photo library must have been corrupted when I did the initial update to iOS 7. Good luck.\n\nA: First, check if their physical footprint still exists. Go to Settings > General > Usage and check the amount of storage available, do you notice that there is a lot of used storage ? You can also check it through iTunes, which might show used memory labeled as Other.\nI lost all my pictures and videos after jailbreaking my phone, yet iTunes showed that they are still taking physical memory (labeled as Other - iTunes did not recognise my pics or vids anymore). This means they cannot be viewed via Camera Roll but they are still stored in the phone.\nTo fix that, download iFunBox ( http://www.i-funbox.com ) and use it to locate and extract the images from the phone (no need for iTunes to access the phone). I managed to extract all my photos from the phone to an external USB, which accumulated to over 20GB of photos and videos.\nUse this method and you should recover your photos and videos with no previous backup. If your phone shows that there is a lot of empty storage, then your photos might have actually been completely removed.\n", "Q: How should I configure my VMware Fusion VM network connections? I've been a long time user of VMware Fusion on my iMac and I've just bought a MacBook Pro to allow me to work on projects whilst I'm away from my desk.\nOn my iMac, I have a few VMs, each with their own bridged connection to the LAN, each with their own static IP address and each with their own DNS hostname on my DNS server on the LAN. I've been using a bridged connection in this way so that other users on the LAN can connect to the VMs running on my Macs to test projects that I am working on without me having to configure NAT rules and users having to use unusual port numbers, etc.\nNow, I'm aware that when I take my MBP away from the LAN and say, for example, I am on a train with no internet connection or WiFi connection, I will be unable to resolve the DNS name of the VMs as my DNS server will not be reachable. A workaround for this, I guess would be an entry for each VM in my /etc/hosts file on my MBP.\nHowever, what I'm not sure of is how my MBP will be able to route traffic destined for the static IP address of each VM, when there is no network connection available.\nGoing through the settings available to me in VMware Fusion, I can only really see two possible configurations that could work for me: Bridged Networking and Share with my Mac. I've discounted Private to my Mac as this doesn't appear to satisfy my requirement of allowing LAN users to connect to my VMs.\nSurely, I'm not the only person who has been faced with this predicament (unless I'm doing it wrong in the first place).\nI would like to know if anyone would be able to answer me the following:\nHow can I setup a VMware Fusion 6 VM to allow bridged network connection to the LAN when I'm at my desk and retain connectivity between my MBP and the VM when I'm \"on the road\"?\n\nA: I have come across this issue many times as well as I work \"on the road\" at times. Unfortunately, the only solution I have found is not ideal (for everyone) but works well for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Wifi HotSpot on my 3G/LTE device.\n\n*Connect to the Wifi HotSpot with my Host (e.g. via Wifi) to activate my Host OS network adapter and obtain an IP address.\nNOTE: Connecting to a public Wifi Network with no DHCP does not work as you will not be able to obtain an IP address for the Host and cannot bridge the VM. Not connecting to any network to activate your Host network adapter will NOT work.\n\n\n*Configure your VM OS to obtain an IP address dynamically i.e. clear out any static IP you have assigned to the VM OS.\n\n\nNOTE: I understand that you want to access the VM OS via a static IP however you need to leverage the networking available to you and it will become clear below.\n\n\n*On your VMWare VM Network Adapter: \"Disconnect Network Adapter\"\n\n*On your VMWare VM Network Adapter: Change to \"NAT\"\n\n*On your VMWare VM Network Adapter: \"Connect Network Adapter\"\n\n*Obtain the IP address of your VM OS:\ne.g. Windows:  ipconfig\ne.g. Mac OS / Linux:  ifconfig\nNOTE: For this example lets assume it is 172.16.175.246\n\n\n*Edit your Host OS hosts file and setup static IP address settings to the IP address obtained in step 5.\ne.g. 172.16.175.246      www.example.com\n\n\nNow access www.example.com and it should work. Once you go back to being a on work network simply undo the above and you are back to business again.\n", "Q: How can I change the length of photos in iMovie '13? I'm trying to make a simple iMovie time lapse video and it's my first time trying to iMovie '13. I have photos that I would like to change the duration of, only when I click the info icon there's just an image of a clock and no option to change the duration, which is how I've been directed on every other forum, only the option just isn't there. Any other ideas on how to change the time length of multiple photos at once?\n\nA: *\n\n*⌘-click on all the pictures that you want to adjust the timing of in the timeline.\n\n*Go to Window → Show Adjustments Bar or press 3.\n\n*Select the info button on the adjustments bar.\n\n*Enter the duration into the box on the right and press Enter.\n\nThis will change the duration of all the selected clips (or in this case, pictures).\n", "Q: OS X restarts every app when waking up When my MacBook Pro (late-2013, Mavericks) wakes up, it restarts all apps after a few seconds. After a wake up, firstly I see all apps running normal then all apps begin restarting. I think I accidentally changed a preference but I can't find it.\n\nA: At last I've found the solution. \nWhen I was watching a movie I saw that message \"Are you sure you want to quit all applications and log out now?\" It was all about a \"Security and Privacy\" preference that quits all application and logout. I found the solution on Apple Support Communities. Here is the solution:\nOpen the \"System Preferences\". In the \"Security and Privacy\" preference pane click the \"Advanced...\" button and uncheck \"Logout after XX minutes of inactivity\".\n\nA: I presume you're talking about Resume, a feature that will cause apps that were left open when you logged out to open again when you login.\nFrom your explanation, I presume you see a window of an app, but then it will fade out and appear to 'restart' — in actuality the app hasn't loaded once yet, and is loading, not restarting.\nYou can stop Resume by unchecking the Reopen windows when logging back in option in a log out or shutdown dialog.\n\nA: This might be due to a bug in OS X Mavericks with no permanent solution so far.

Recently I added context menu under services to execute python script but I think it would be convenient if  I add a button on the Finder toolbar, like next to New Folder Button in below image.\n\nIs this possible at add button on Finder Toolbar that triggers a python script and passes the current folder as argument  ?\n\nA: See if this works.\nDownload the Get first Finder Window Path BETA 10.9 automator action from from my blog : my_very_first_automator_action \nThe action returns the path of the front most finder window. It does not take any input from above actions. The post explains it all :-)\nCreate a new Application document in Automator and add the Get first Finder Window Path to it. Then just add you Run shell script after it.\nSave as Application. And then do the drag and drop.\nI would test it with your code but I do not have the python slideshow...\n\nNote from Apple documentation in regard to Third party Actions.\n\nInstalling Actions When your action has been thoroughly debugged and\n  tested, build a deployment version of the bundle (using the proper\n  optimizations). Then create an installation package for the action (or\n  add the action to your application’s installation package). The\n  installer should copy the action to /Library/Automator or\n  ~/Library/Automator, depending on whether access to the action should\n  be system wide or restricted to the installing user.\nInstead of installing your action separately, you can put it inside\n  the bundle of your application, especially if the action uses the\n  features of that application. When Automator searches for actions to\n  display, it looks inside registered applications as well in the\n  standard Automator directories. The advantage of packaging your\n  actions inside an application is that you don’t need to create a\n  separate installation package to install the actions. To install the\n  actions, users need only drag the application to a standard location.\nAction bundles should be stored inside the application wrapper at\n  Contents/Library/Automator. Thus, if your action is MyAction.action\n  and your application is MyApp.app, the path inside the application\n  would be:\nMyApp.app/Contents/Library/Automator/MyAction.action\n\nYou can either manually copy an action into this location (after\n  creating the necessary subdirectories) or you have Xcode copy it using\n  a Copy Files build phase. If you copy an action into an application\n  bundle but the application is already installed on a system, you must\n  get Launch Services to recognize that the application has new content\n  to register (that is, the new action) by changing the application’s\n  modification date. You can do this by entering the touch command in\n  the Terminal application.\nsudo touch /Applications/MyApp.app\n\nOr you can rename the application in Finder to something else, change\n  it back to the original name, and then launch the application once.\n\n", "Q: Can I use a Mac Pro for my office and run Parallels for my Windows-based ERP software? I have a small business that runs a Windows-based network.  I'm wondering if I can set up a Mac Pro, with virtual servers, and use Parallels for my ERP software?  Basically, can I have a Mac-based server and still run my business software? \n\nA: Both Parallels or VMware Fusion will work for you.  \nMy personal preference is for VMware.\n", "Q: How to delete all files in one folder that are the same as in another folder I have two folders containing videos: the first contains videos that are already referenced within Aperture, and the second contains a mix of duplicates as well as videos that are NOT already in Aperture. What I'd like to do is have the second folder contain ONLY files that are not already in Aperture (so that I can add them). How can I relatively easily delete the duplicate files in the second folder? I've been playing around with Deltopia's DeltaWalker, but it doesn't appear able to allow me to delete the duplicate files easily.\n\nA: Gemini will let you do this.\nOpen the app, go to Preferences → Auto Select and add the path of the folder that you want to keep the files to the Never Select list.\n\nThen, add the folders to the scan list and press Scan. Once it's complete, you can press Auto Select to automatically mark the duplicates, then delete them.\n", "Q: Can't install any app, App Store asks for credit card I haven't been installing anything on my iPad Mini for the past few weeks.

Something seems to have changed for the worse in iOS 7. Under iOS 6, it used to be possible to select various \"identifiers\" (email, telephone number) to be used for FaceTime for the same person, and these could be labeled differently. In iOS 7, when adding FaceTime favorites, one is given the option of adding the contact for FaceTime or FaceTime audio, but it isn't clear how to add a specific identifier for a contact.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there seems to be no easy solution to replace the iOS 6 functionality. \nThe simplest workaround seems to be to create multiple contacts for each point of contact you wish to differentiate.\nAnother possible workaround would be to add the different identifiers to 'favorites'. However, these will appear identical in favorites---same name & pic---so it would be difficult to differentiate.\n(Based on personal experience and this related apple support thread)\n", "Q: Accidentally moving windows using mouse I'm ex-Windows user. There was no way to drag maximized window, but it's possible in OS X (I have Mavericks). \nThere is full screen mode, but I have found one annoying thing there - it's too hard to get access to the Dock. I have to point my cursor at the bottom of the screen and wait for a long time, unlike default behavior in non-fullscreen mode.\nIs there a way to lock maximized windows, allowing to move them only with ⌘ or ⌥ key?\n\nA: Currently, no, this isn't possible.\nThere's no such thing as maximising a window in OS X — I therefore presume you are referring to a window which has been stretched to fill the entire screen (as much as possible — i.e. not behind the menu bar). Since there is no difference between a window which has been enlarged and a 'maximised' window, there's no problem in dragging the window away from the menu bar, and it's not possible to prevent.\nIf you're always moving your windows, try something like BetterTouchTool. This lets you maximise any window by dragging it to the top of the screen.\n", "Q: Can a non-retina MacBook's screen be replaced with a Retina screen? I'm using a MacBook Pro Late 2011. The processor, RAM, hard drive - just about everything else still work fine. I'd like to have retina display without necessarily buying a new unit.\nIs there a way to change my screen to a retina display - i.e. physically removing the old screen and replacing it with a retina one?\n\nA: Not easily. The Retina MacBook Pro introduced a new display assembly which makes retro-fitting very difficult.\n\nRather than sandwich an LCD panel between a back case and a piece of glass in front, Apple used the aluminium case itself as the frame for the LCD panel and used the LCD as the front glass\n\nSource: http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+Retina+Display+Teardown/9493\nThe cost of doing so would probably be more than the rMBP itself.\n\nA: It won't work. This iFixit answer outlines the various issues:\n\nUnfortunately, the simple answer is no. The graphics card would have issues running the display if you were even able to install it. The Retina display MacBook Pro also has different connectors and dimensions then the regular Macbook Pro and therefore not fit and not connect. The firmware for you computer will also not scale the resolution and render properly so you would have a 1440 x 900 resolution displaying on a 2880 x 1800 display which would only take up 1/4 of the display.\n\nAs the answerer says, your biggest problem is the graphics card. The mobile card on your Late 2011 MacBook Pro just isn't designed to push quadruple the pixels at an acceptable framerate.\n\nA: Since Apple computers hold their value so well, you might be able to sell your existing Mac and buy a new one for less than the difference in part cost and have two fully supported Macs in service - the one you sold and the one you now have.\nDoing any sort of DIY customization is always possible with enough budget and experience, but even if you were to get the display panel connected the old CPU/GPU will likely be very underpowered or balk at running the new display without extensive firmware modifications or tweaks.\n\nA: i did by bringing to a tech fix store near me, and i assume it could be done to yours if the computer would support it.\n\nA: actually i think you can, as I bought the wrong display to my 15\" macbook pro 2009, i bought on ebay a macbook pro display of late 2012/early 2013 and these are retina display! It worked fine but i had to re-sale it as the video conectors are the same but not the wifi/bluetooth/camera connectors, and the screw of the hinge are placed differentley but it still holds minus 1 screw! For the resolution i havn't tried to configure it to retina resolution to see if it could work, I suppose it was working at the native resolution of what my macbook could offer, but it was working fine!\n\nA: You can change it to a Hi-Res (but not Retina) display from Apple, I think, but it is only for the 15 inch model\n", "Q: “All My Files” in Finder: How to list all files on mounted DASD instead of all local files? I understand “All My Files” option in Finder lists local files only.

You can re-enable it after the symlink is set up.\n\nA: I know this question is explicitly asking about the Terminal, but if you're in GUI Land and don't want to enter Terminal Land, you can use SymbolicLinker. This puts a \"Make Symbolic Link\" option in your Services menu in Finder.\n\n\n\nA: It's just ln -s <source> <destination>.\n\nA: ln -s /some/dir/ ~/Desktop/dir\nYou can also create a symlink for directory using the same command\nln -s \"$(pwd)\" ~/Desktop/dir\nTo create symlink to current directory you are in. \n\nA: As a heads up to anyone, you must use full path names. This wasn't immediately clear to me, as I felt I could symlink relative paths in a folder that I was running the command inside. I could be wrong (I'm a macOS novice).\nFor example, if I try to symlink my Pictures folder inside of my Downloads folder, while cd'd in my user home directory, this will not work:\nUsers\\stevebauman >_ ln -s Pictures Downloads\n\nInstead, you must use:\nUsers\\stevebauman >_ ln -s /Users/stevebauman/Pictures /Users/stevebauman/Downloads\n\n\nA: Unless the source path is relative to your destination, use an absolute path to your source path, and put it in single quotes\n$ ln -s '/any file/could have (special chars)/or spaces/test' '/some/other place/file'\n\nYou can always figure out the current full unescaped path to something by going to that folder in the terminal, then typing\n$ pwd\n\n", "Q: Connecting a Dell U2412M to a 2013 Retina MacBook Pro using DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort I recently got a Dell U2412M monitor. I'm attempting to connect it to my 2013 Retina MacBook Pro using a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable. I repeatedly get a \"Entering Power Saving Mode\" dialog on the monitor. The only time I've been able to successfully connect to the monitor is if I unplug the monitor completely, turn off the computer and turn them on in sync (even this only works 30% of the time). However, connecting it using a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter works as expected.\nIs there a way to force the computer to detect the display using the terminal? I've tried using apps from the App Store that bring back the old Detect Displays option, but those don't work either. \nThere are posts regarding this on other sites, but none provide a solution. Since the DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable are the most convenient to use, so I wanted to see if anyone here has solved a similar issue, before giving up and using DVI.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem with a Dell monitor.  After months of support calls and monitor replacements, it ended up being the cable.\nThe problem was using a Mini-DP to DP cable.  For some reason, the DP chips in the cable is not sending a signal that Dell monitors are expecting or the length of the cable causes the signal to degrade.\nThe fix? Buy a Mini-DP to DP adapter then use a 1.2 DP to DP cable to connect to the monitor.  I know it sounds lame and the MiniDP to DP cable should work but after I switched out the cable for this setup, I didn't experience the issue again.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Running Steam game in fullscreen doesn't allow second screen to show anything else (Mavericks) In Mavericks, when I'm running a full screen game, the second screen can't show desktop (or browser, or anything else.)  My understanding is that Mavericks sets the second screen in a different Space so both can be used.  Am I doing something wrong or is that a wrong understanding?\n\nA: I believe Steam uses its own full-screen mechanism independent of the system's full-screen option.  Since it's not the typical full-screen provided by OS X, the multiple spaces feature doesn't work here.\n", "Q: Rebuilding Fusion Drive I have a Fusion Drive (10.9.1) with a 256GB SSD and a 1TB HDD. The 1TB HDD has started making noises and has reported SMART errors. It is apparent that it will fail any day.

I know I need to swap the new HDD into the array, but if I clone the old drive onto the new drive, will Fusion continue working, or will I have to restore from Time Machine?\n\nA: So I tried to clone the drive, but had an error part of the way through that I did not notice. My solution has now been to reinstall OSX onto a new Fusion drive then restore from Time Machine. The clone method should work as far as I can tell though!\n", "Q: My computer is broken, how can I get my music onto my iPad? My computer is broken and I have just acquired an iPad. All my music was on my computer and accessed through iTunes but that computer no longer functions.\nI don't think I was using iCloud.\nHow do I save all my music and get it onto my iPad?\n\nA: If it was music you purchased from the iTunes store it is automatically available for you to redownload from the iTunes Store on your iPad. You don't need to have bought iTunes Match; tracks purchased via the iTunes Store are always available for re-downloading fromt he store. Just set your iPad up with your iTunes account and you should see the tracks in the store as having be bought and available for download to your iPad.\nIf the music wasn't from the iTunes Store and you weren't using iTunes Match to copy your music in to iCloud your options are extremely limited. With iTunes Match you could turn on the feature on your iPad and you would see your entire library, stored in the cloud, available to you.\nIf the hard drive of your broken computer is still functional you can hook it up to another computer, associate the new machine with your Apple ID, copy the music off the old computer's hard drive by using iTunes Add to Library feature found under the File menu. Once you've added the files to the library, you can connect your iPad to this machine and transfer the music on to your iPad. At this point you may want to consider subscribing to iTunes Match to move the content to the cloud, otherwise you need to use this computer to sync new music to the iPad.\nIf the hard drive of your broken computer is no longer functional you have no options. Your files are lost. Hopefully you had a back up in the form of Time Machine or a third party service like CrashPlan.\n", "Q: Why is the Apple menu icon in the wrong place on my secondary monitor?

I am trying to move a large (100GB+) folder from the Desktop into a subfolder on the Desktop. When I drag and drop, it invokes a copy, and I do not want to wait an hour while it goes through with this (I will need to do several such moves.) I have read that holding CMD while drag-dropping will invoke move, but it does not. If I wait for a folder to finish the alleged \"move\" operation, it turns out to be a copy, with the original folder left behind.\nInterestingly, if I attempt to move (drag/drop) a smaller folder, it does so without issue. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: If you are comfortable using /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app, you can use the mv command. \nmv <source folder> <destination folder>\n\nTo make typing simpler, type mv (with a space after) then drag the folder icon of the source folder into the Terminal window, then drag the folder icon of the destination into the Terminal window. This will construct the correct paths to the folders, including escaping space characters should they exist in the folder names.\nThis operation works in the background so you can get on with other things, and can be quite speedy as it doesn't rely on the Finder. I've found this method the best for transferring (copying cp or moving mv) hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of files, which the Finder can choke on. I suggest you do a few tests to make sure you get the hang of it.\n\nA: Drag/drop should move and not copy the folder. Normally Mac only defaults to copying if you're moving something to a different volume, such as a USB mass storage device.\nAre you sure you're not misreading the move window it's titled \"Copy\" even when it's moving files.\n\n\nA: This question appears to be related, it seems to be a permissions issue. I worked around this by creating a new folder at my destination and moving the folder contents into that new folder, instead of trying to directly move the folder itself. This invoked a proper Move operation without any special commands or key combos, and the files were moved instantaneously.\n\nA: Open your terminal (Terminal.app)\nThen do:\nmv source_folder destination_folder\ne.g:\nmv /Users/foo/Music/ /Users/foo/something\nThis is way faster than copying as it maintains inode\n\nA: You can use option + command + V for moving a file or folder to destination folder after copy it using command + C.\n\nA: This threw me as well after installing mavericks. \nIt's some kind of authorization/permissions thing … dragging folders from the root HD to the Desktop always resulted in a copy, regardless of command or option keys.\nIn my case fixed by doing a Get Info on the HD and Desktop ,  and changing the folder permissions to  Read/Write.\n\nA: Simply hold down the \"Command\" key while dragging a file or folder to enable the \"Move\" action as opposed to the default \"Copy\" action in OS X Mavericks. \n\nA: Check the file permissions for the source folder before moving.Change it to read & write  mode.It will work\n", "Q: User account doesn't appear on first login screen After restarting my computer when I am presented with the initial login screen (the light gray one with the restart and shut down buttons), I see only two of my three user accounts.\nIf I log in with one of these accounts, I can see, and log in to, the third (missing) account by either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logging off (Apple > Log Out...) to reach the second login screen (the dark gray one with sleep/restart/shut down buttons)\n\n*Clicking on the fast user switching menu.\n\n\nHow can I restore this account in the initial (light gray) login screen?\nI tried repairing disk permissions to no avail.\nIf I create a new account, it does show up in the list.\n\nA: Have you turned on FileVault 2 encryption?

I have a mid 2011 27\" iMac running Mavericks (10.9.1). I updated from Mountain Lion this Fall when Mavericks was released. I never had any problem before with my system clock.\nSince installing Mavericks my clock consistently gains about 20 seconds per day. I have my Time Zone correctly set and \"Set Date and Time Automatically\" is checked in my Date & Time system preferences. It is set to use \"Apple/Americas/U.S. (time.apple.com)\"\nWhen I open the Date & Time System Preferences pane my clock gets adjusted immediately to the correct time, but without opening the pane, it gets off track pretty quickly.\nI have rebooted, checked and unchecked the box to set the date and time automatically and neither seems to have helped.\nAny solutions or ideas?\n\nUPDATE:\nI have made what feels like progress. Question: How can I tell if my mac is keeping the clock updated properly? and its accepted answer by grgarside provided a lot of helpful troubleshooting help. My drift is a whopping 499.988 (gains 43.19 seconds per day)!\nMost importantly, pacemaker is running every 5 - 15 seconds, as evidenced by my stem log, however, every time it runs it gets an error:\nFeb  1 11:53:29 jsw.local pacemaker[19928]: adjtime: Operation not permitted\nFeb  1 11:53:39 jsw.local pacemaker[19928]: adjtime: Operation not permitted\nFeb  1 11:53:51 jsw.local pacemaker[19928]: adjtime: Operation not permitted\nFeb  1 11:53:59 jsw.local pacemaker[19928]: adjtime: Operation not permitted\nFeb  1 11:54:09 jsw.local pacemaker[19928]: adjtime: Operation not permitted\nFeb  1 11:54:19 jsw.local pacemaker[19928]: adjtime: Operation not permitted\n\nIt seems I have a permission problem, but I cannot figure it out. I have unloaded and reloaded the pacemaker plsit via launchctl\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pacemaker.plist\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pacemaker.plist\n\nhere is a text export of my com.apple.pacemaker.plist\n{\n    Label = \"com.apple.pacemaker\";\n    ProgramArguments = (\n        \"/usr/libexec/pacemaker\",\n        \"-b\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"0.0001\",\n        \"-a\",\n        10,\n    );\n    KeepAlive = {\n        PathState = {\n            \"/private/var/db/ntp.drift\" = YES;\n        };\n    };\n}\n\nmy /private/var/db/ntp.drift file is owned by root:wheel and its permissions are 644, /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pacemaker.plist has exactly the same ownership and permissions.\nI hope this update provides enough additional information so that someone can get me past this issue.\n\nA: Maverisks' ntpd is broken, smashed, corrupt.  Apple knows about this: I've spent hours on the phone to them, providing them samples and files galore.  It may be a carry over from iOS (\"Back to the Mac\" whether or not it actually works).  The culprit seems to be a new with Maverisks daemon called \"pacemaker\", which in classic Apple fashion is under documented and does not appear to behave in accordance with what little documentation there is.\n\nA: these seem to work ok on my iMac, running Mountain Lion:\n\n0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 2.pool.ntp.org 3.pool.ntp.org time.apple.com\n\nsimply copy/paste the space-separated line above into the ’Set date and time automatically’ field, in Date & Time preferences. remember to press Enter after typing the ntp server names, so that ntp.conf gets updated.\n\nA: Before making a fresh install, I strongly suggest you to try resetting your NVRAM(non-volatile RAM).\nA NVRAM(or PRAM on older, PowerPC-based Macs) stores certain settings. It's a kind of memory like the regular RAM in your Mac but with one major difference being that a NVRAM stores what's on it even if your Mac gets turned off.\nSpecifically, information stored in NVRAM / PRAM includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Speaker volume\n\n*Time-zone settings\n\n*Screen resolution\n\n*Startup disk selection\n\n*Recent kernel panic, if any\n\n\nProbably, what's stored on your NVRAM about your time got corrupted somehow and now causes your issue.\nNow, you might ask, what about the syncing of time with servers? What do I need that for? Well, it's just for setting your time instead of you doing it manually. Just a little gesture; nothing more. After it gets set then it's stored on your NVRAM as usual.\nAnd your time gets corrected every time you open your Date & Time Preferences because probably opening there initiates a manual syncing of your time with the server. But after that things go haywire again.\nAnyway, in order to reset your NVRAM:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac.\n\n*Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P, and R. You will need to hold these keys down simultaneously in step 4.\n\n*Turn on the computer.\n\n*Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys before the gray screen appears.\n\n*Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time.\n\n*Release the keys.\n\n\nSource: Apple\n\nA: You can ntpdate via launchd.\nI’ve put the pieces together at https://github.com/tjluoma/ntp-fix-time but I’ll include the relevant bits here:\n\n\n*\n\n*A launchd plist that goes into /Library/LaunchDaemons/ (because it needs to be run as root when it runs)\n\n*A shell script that calls ntpdate -u $NTPHOST and logs its output.\nFor some reason, trying to call ntpdate directly via launchd didn’t work for me, but calling it via a script seemed to work.\nThe plist uses this:\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n\nto make sure it runs when the Mac is rebooted.\nThis:\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>14400</integer>\n\nmakes sure that it runs every 4 hours, which seemed like it was “often enough.” \nThe script will use the servers listed in /etc/ntp.conf unless there aren’t any, in which case it will use time.apple.com.\n(The man page for ntpdate suggests that it will eventually be ‘retired’ from Mac OS X but it’s still there in 10.9.1, so that’s enough for me.)\n\nA: I have thus far been unsuccessful in eliminating the clock drift. Because my clock drifts slowly (less than a minute per day) It takes a while to see if the attempted solution works.\nI have just now tried a variation of Patrix's answer from this post. The echo did not work on the command line, I got \"permission denied\" (His answer was referencing a Lion install). But I did remove the old file and replace it with a new one which I edited with nano.\nsudo rm /etc/ntp.conf\nsudo touch /etc/ntp.conf\nsudo nano /etc/ntp.conf\n\nin the file I simply placed\nserver time.apple.com\n\nno trailing . or new line. I then exited nano (ctrl-X) and answered yes to saving changes.\nI did not need to change owners since it was already owned by root:wheel.\nI'll update when I know if this worked.\n\nA: Here is an updated list for the servers based in Gaithersburg, Maryland (I'm on the East Coast). Other servers are provided in the link at the bottom.\n\ntime-a-g.nist.gov time-b-g.nist.gov time-c-g.nist.gov time-d-g.nist.gov time-d-g.nist.gov time-e-g.nist.gov time-e-g.nist.gov \n\nCopy \\ paste the whitespace separated list into the ’set date and time automatically’ field, in Date & Time preferences.\nBe sure to reset your NVRAM after updating the servers.\nSource\n\nA: I wanted to provide my two cents on this problem. I had a similar problem.\nMy clock would be an hour behind and what worked for me was to uncheck the Set time zone automatically using current location, and just manually choosing the closest city. It doesn't hurt to give it a try and see if it makes a difference. \n\nA: As has been discussed elsewhere the clock drift is due to ntpd not working and something called /usr/libexec/pacemaker not working right, either.  Disabling pacemaker and running ntpdate to slew the clock has gotten the clock reasonably stable on my system, with minimal system changes.\nFrom Terminal, run these commands in order.\ncd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/\nmv com.apple.pacemaker.plist com.apple.pacemaker.plist.OFF\nsudo crontab -l > /tmp/foo\necho '*/5 * * * * /usr/sbin/ntpdate -s -B -u time.apple.com' >> /tmp/foo\nsudo crontab /tmp/foo\n\nThen restart the system.\nThe first two commands disable pacemaker by moving its launchd configuration file out of the way.  The last three commands tell the system cron daemon to run ntpdate every five minutes, slowing down or speeding up the clock as needed, and logging what it does to /var/log/system.log.\n\nA: If you call Apple, they will suggest that you do a reinstall preserving the operating system.\nMy guess is that you have a corrupted preference. You can try changing every setting in the Date and Time preference panel to something else, reboot, then set it to what you want. If that doesn't work go into the Preferences directory and remove anything preference plist that has something to do with Preferences Date and Time.\n", "Q: How do I read the output of dns-sd? When I run the dns-sd command, for example as dns-sd -B _services._dns-sd._udp. to list all the service types on my local network, I get a table that looks like:\n$ dns-sd -B _services._dns-sd._udp.\nBrowsing for _services._dns-sd._udp.\nDATE: ---Tue 31 Dec 2013---\n14:39:57.995  ...STARTING...\nTimestamp     A/R    Flags  if Domain               Service Type         Instance Name\n14:39:57.995  Add        3   4 .                    _tcp.local.          _ssh\n14:39:57.996  Add        3   4 .                    _tcp.local.          _sftp-ssh\n\nI get \"Timestamp\", and \"A/R\" is probably Add/Remove.  What are \"Flags\"?  What's \"if\"?\n\nA: A half answer:\nI found the source code for dns-sd.c and dns_sd.h, dating back to 2004 and OS X \"Lion\", where \"flags\" is a value of type DNSServiceFlags, which seems to be one of these (deprecated) constants.  If that's so, then \"1\" means \"kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing\": another entry should follow immediately. \"2\" means just \"kDNSServiceFlagsAdd\". \"3\" means \"kDNSServiceFlagsAdd\" together with \"kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing\". Not very useful.\nAccording to that same program, \"if\" is uint32_t ifIndex,  the \"interface index\", which is also mentioned on that Apple developer page.  I'm seeing values like \"4\" and \"0\", and I can't quite figure out the meaning.  It seems to be both a bitmask for requesting a class of interface (where 0 means \"any\", and -1/-2/-3 cast to an uint32_t are other classes), and an index into a list of network interfaces (where 0 means \"error\", and positive integers indicate a valid interface).  I only have one active network interface, and I can't tell that it's \"#4\" of anything, or why I'd see \"0\" for some dns-sd requests.\nApple's mDNSResponder code, in many revisions across many years, is at https://opensource.apple.com/source/mDNSResponder/.\n\nA: \"if\" is short for \"interface\".\n\"interface\" is a term in the networking protocol stack arena, and in this case, an interface is a software entity that binds up to the bottom end of the Internet Protocol (IP) layer of the stack.\nAn \"interface\" software module provides a known API to IP, to bind network hardware drivers into the IP layer. Typical interfaces provide this binding for things like Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, Firewire, etc.\nSince any given machine can have more than one physical media interface, the IP layer can bind to multiple interfaces. These bindings are kept track of via simple index values in a table.\nThe \"if\" value in the dns-sd display is simply the index number of the interface for which the service is accessible.\nYou can find out what interfaces are configured in your system which other command line utilities, such as netstat -i. In OS X and other UNIX, you may see <Link#4> listed, meaning index 4.\n", "Q: Set Services keyboard shortcut via script OSX I need a way to set the following programmatically:\n\nSpecifically for shortcuts under Services, if that makes a difference.

Replace test2 with the name of the service. Quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.\n^~@2 is control-option-command-2. See http://osxnotes.net/keybindings.html.\n\nA: Like most preferences, keyboard shortcuts can be set using \"defaults write\" commands in the Terminal. Useful if you have lots of shortcuts that you want to define, or if you have more than one Mac to set up.\nHowever, the syntax isn't quite the same as the usual commands for setting a key to a value.\nFor Application-specific commands, use the following:\ndefaults write com.developer.app NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Menu Item\" -string \"@$~^k\"\n\nThe meta-keys are set as @ for Command, $ for Shift, ~ for Alt and ^ for Ctrl. k in this example is the non-meta-key that you want to use.\nFor system-wide shortcuts, you can use -g instead of the app identifier, e.g.\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Menu Item\" -string \"@$~^k\" \n\nNote that you'll need to relaunch the app before these will take effect. Also you can see if they've been successful in System Preferences -- which will also need a relaunch to show the changes.\n\nA: Services keyboard shortcuts are a bit different than Application-specific or system-wide shortcuts, although they can be managed using defaults read and defaults write.\nThe easiest way I've found to figure this sort of thing out is:\ndefaults read > /tmp/a\n\nChange the keyboard shortcut manually using System Preferences\ndefaults read > /tmp/b\ndiff /tmp/[ab]\n\nFor the specific case of keyboard shortcuts for Services, in OS-X 10.8 the important domains are \"com.apple.ServicesMenu.Services\" and \"pbs\".  You need to look at the \ncom.apple.ServicesMenu.Services domain to get the information needed to create an entry in the pbs domain.\nFor example:\nThe CFVendedServices key from com.apple.ServicesMenu.Services for \"Unarchive to Current Folder is:\n{\n    NSBundleIdentifier = \"cx.c3.theunarchiver\";\n    NSBundlePath = \"/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/the-unarchiver/3.9.1/The Unarchiver.app\";\n    NSKeyEquivalent = { };\n    NSMenuItem = {\n        default = \"The Unarchiver/Unarchive To Current Folder\";\n    };\n    NSMessage = unarchiveToCurrentFolderWithPasteboard;\n    NSPortName = \"The Unarchiver\";\n    NSSendTypes = (\n        NSFilenamesPboardType\n    );\n    NSUUID = <be1910e8 cb1a3475 90854bc5 09f0c0ab>;\n},\n\nTo create a keyboard shortcut for it, the pbs NSServices key is constructed from the NSBundleIdentifier, NSMenuItem and NSMessage. Example:\ndefaults read pbs\n\n{\n        \"cx.c3.theunarchiver - The Unarchiver/Unarchive To Current Folder - unarchiveToCurrentFolderWithPasteboard\" =         {\n            \"enabled_context_menu\" = 1;\n            \"enabled_services_menu\" = 1;\n            \"key_equivalent\" = \"@~^u\";\n        };\n        \"org.vim.MacVim - MacVim/New MacVim Buffer Here - newFileHere\" =         {\n            \"key_equivalent\" = \"@~^v\";\n        };\n    };\n}\n\nUnfortunately, the pbs domain is constructed as nested dictionaries which cannot be handled by defaults write like this simpler cases for other keyboard shortcuts. You'll need to read the entire NSServicesStatus key, insert your new entry, then write it back:\ndefaults write pbs NSServicesStatus '{\n    \"com.cocoatech.PathFinder - Path Finder/Show Info - getInfoInPathFinderService\" =     {\n        \"key_equivalent\" = \"@~^$i\";\n    };\n    \"cx.c3.theunarchiver - The Unarchiver/Unarchive To Current Folder - unarchiveToCurrentFolderWithPasteboard\" =     {\n        \"enabled_context_menu\" = 1;\n        \"enabled_services_menu\" = 1;\n        \"key_equivalent\" = \"@~^u\";\n    };\n    \"org.vim.MacVim - MacVim/New MacVim Buffer Here - newFileHere\" =     {\n        \"key_equivalent\" = \"@~^v\";\n    };\n}'\n\nIt may also be necessary to force pbs to flush its cache:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/pbs -flush\n\n\nA: I'm lazy - I use a tool like FastScripts to set global keyboard shortcuts and invoke scripts.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/\nIt's free unless you need 11 or more shortcuts defined.

My wife recently got an iPhone and, being that I'm an iPhone user already, I set up iTunes Home Sharing (under my Apple ID) so that I could share some of my purchased apps with her.\nWhile paid apps transferred to her phone without a problem, in-app purchases that I had made under my account didn't transfer over.\nIs this the correct behavior? Our phones are set up under different Apple IDs, but I was still able to transfer purchased (paid upfront) apps to her – which is completely allowed under the Terms of Use – so I assumed the same would apply to in-app purchases as well.\n\nA: Firstly, you must bear in mind that each In-App Purchase is uniquely associated with an Apple ID and that there are different In-App Purchase types:\n\n\n*\n\n*Consumable - You need to purchase these items every time you want them, and you can't download them again for free.\n\n*Non-Consumable - You purchase these items one time, and you can transfer them to multiple devices authorized with the same iTunes Store account.\n\n*Non-renewing Subscriptions - You can purchase these items again after the subscription period ends.\n\n*Auto-Renewable Subscriptions - You can purchase these items with different renewal periods.\n\n\nThere are, therefore, differences in the way the availability of the product is handled.  \nAs stated on Apple's iTunes Store: About In-App Purchases:\n\nYou can't sync or transfer non-renewing subscriptions and consumable In-App Purchase to another iOS device or Mac. You can transfer non-consumable In-App Purchases and auto-renewable subscriptions to another iOS device or Mac authorized with your iTunes Store account. For example, if you transfer a game from an iPhone to an iPod touch, only the game levels will sync, and the extra ammo and experience points won't transfer.\n\n\nA: I do believe that is a no, if you were to buy currency or items in a game, then those would be duplicated and cause possible errors. I think there may be a way in some apps to \"claim\" previous app purchases but I may be wrong.\n", "Q: How does one change the share name with file sharing in Mac OS X? In Mac OS X you can create shared folders. Usually the share name is the same as the folder, but it can be different. For example if the is a user with display name \"John Doe\" and system name \"johnd\" the system creates a Shared folder named \"Public\" in the users folder Users/johnd/Public but the share name is \"John Doe's Public Folder\".\nIf that Shared folder is removed from the File Sharing folder list and re-added then it just shows as \"Public\".\nHow do you change the Share name?\n\nA: Use Directory Utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Directory Utility\n\n*Select the Directory Editor tab\n\n*In the \"Viewing\" bar, select SharePoints in node /Local/Default\n\n*Authenticate by clicking the little lock button\n\n\nShares are listed in the left-hand column.

There are various ways to do this, including using Xcode or TextWrangler to edit the .plist file, but it is fiddly because the sharepoint directory is only accessible by root.\nThe easiest way is probably to use a little script like this one to make the necessary changes:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Usage: rename-share oldname newname\n\nset -e\nOLDNAME=$1\nNEWNAME=$2\n\ncd /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/sharepoints\nif [ ! -f \"$OLDNAME\".plist ] ; then\n    echo \"No share named $OLDNAME found.\" 1>&2\n    exit 3\nfi\nif [ -z \"$NEWNAME\" ] ; then\n    echo \"Must specify new name\" 1>&2\n    exit 2\nfi\n\nmv \"$OLDNAME\".plist \"$NEWNAME\".plist\nfor key in ftp_name afp_name smb_name name ; do\n    defaults write /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/sharepoints/\"$NEWNAME\" $key -array \"$NEWNAME\"\ndone\n\nTo use it, save that to (say) ~/bin/rename-share, then chmod a+x ~/bin/rename-share to make it executable, then use it like this (assuming that John Doe's public folder is currently shared as \"Public\"):\n$ sudo ~/bin/rename-share \"Public\" \"John Doe's Public Folder\"\n\n", "Q: iChat sends out connections to an IP address when configuring camera and mic settings Using LittleSnitch I noticed that Messages (iChat) tries to connect to 17.154.239.222 over udp when I open the audio and video preferences for the application.

There is still 4.8 GB free from 5 GB, but I have a notification in iPad's backup window that I'm lacking space to back up to iCloud and would rather not buy more space to back up today.\n\nA: In my case, I have the problem that iCloud estimates my data usage to be 10.9GB, while I have chosen to back up maybe only 1-2GB. If I turn, for example, camera roll off or on again, it doesn't matter.\niCloud estimates this wild, high, far too much space to make a backup, and I even deleted my previous backup and started new, to be sure to 'reset' everything, but it doesn't help!\nMy iPad only uses 2.2 GB, I have 2.8 left for the phone, and select 'no backup' for most, but the mail and a few programs like Skype and so on, altogether far less than \"10.9\" GB, probably only 1-2GB. \nThis problem seemingly happened before, the iCloud backup grow out of control, like a classical Windows installation.\nHowever, I now see that, as I deactivate more and more smaller applications, of a few kb size of their data, that the total usage decrease much more than these few kb which are stated for each app.\nThis means that Apple seemingly underreports how much data they backup, from each app, or maybe the system counts too much, I don't know.\nIt is not possible to deactivate all the apps at once, in the hope to get down to the 17MB which is stated on the first page, (e-mail and settings), so there will be a lot of job to make this work again... :-/\n\nA: This could easily be explained as the 120 MB of used data is likely for the data all the apps store in iCloud. Contacts, calendars, specific third party apps can have storage in iCloud. You can determine this by looking at the Manage Storage pane in settings app (see below).\nThe warning you describe comes up when the expected size of the next backup is greater than the available free space.\nYou can reduce the size of the expected backup on iOS (updated for iOS 16) as follows:\n\n*\n\n*open the Settings app\n\n*tap your AppleID/iCloud avatar (first item, top of list)\n\n*tap iCloud\n\n*tap Manage Account Storage\n\n*tap Backups\n\n*tap the name of the device in question (it usually says this iPod touch, this iPhone or this iPad to help if you have many devices connected to iCloud)\n\n*look at Next Backup Size\n\n*toggle off any unwanted apps from the list below\n\nIf that is less than the available space, you may need to contact Apple support to have your account fixed on the server side. In most cases, you can toggle off the largest few items and then attempt a backup when the estimate is less than the available space.\n\nOnce the backup is complete, you can tune the backups or manage your space as needed on iCloud.\n\nOn iOS 15 I did have an open case with Apple. I have a 256 iPhone that refuses to back up to iCloud or a Mac with out of space errors and it’s not possible since the phone has less total space than either destinations have free. Once I enabled my support pin with them, it did show podcasts needed to back up 590 GB of data (on a 256 phone) so I disabled that from backup and then it backed up successfully. Once the \"partial\" backup was done, I re-enabled podcasts app to backup and it had a reasonable amount of space (less than 500 MB) and the situation was sorted while preserving all data to iCloud.\n\nA: The solution where you disable certain data from being backed up in iCloud is not really a solution but merely a workaround. Unfortunately, the real solution would imply you paying for iCloud's yearly subscription charges. \nOr keep your iPhone backup out of the cloud an on your PC instead: There is not enough iCloud storage available. How to backup iPhone\nAlternatively, keep the Camera Roll under iCloud backup settings disabled as that eats lots of space and back up your iPhone to your PC via iTunes. This way you don't lose the backup of your Camera Roll. \n\nA: *\n\n*Are you sure you only need 120 MB for iCloud Backup?\nCheck the size of the 'next backup' in iCloud Backup on your device. Make sure that it's less than the free space of your iCloud account.\n\n*Are you checking the storage of the correct iCloud account?\nMake sure that you're looking up the free space of the correct iCloud account if you have multiple. Only the main iCloud account can be used for iCloud Backup — accessible through Settings → iCloud.\n", "Q: How can I get iTunes on my new MacBook to acknowledge an existing Podcasts directory? I'm setting up my new MacBook Pro and iTunes doesn't acknowledge an existing Podcasts directory that I have on a networked drive.  This directory was created by iTunes running on my Windows laptop.  (I made sure to change the iTunes Media Folder location in Preferences, and Podcasts is an existing subfolder.)\nThe thing that is extra-confusing for me is that, when iTunes downloaded the latest episode of a podcast (just now), it put it into that same Podcasts folder, so I'm confident that I've set up the media location properly.\nHow can I say to iTunes, \"no, you don't need to download any of those old podcasts, they're right there\"?\n\nA: This can happen with any file type, not just Podcasts, and I've suffered from this a few times when I move my iTunes library about, especially with TV Shows.\nThe only solution I found was to move the episodes out of the iTunes Media folder, then use the Add to Library in iTunes to add them back in.

Then, delete the Mobile Applications folder from Windows Explorer/Finder to remove the apps that have been backed up to iTunes.\nLong Answer\nMake sure you read the Apple support page before you get started, but basically, I would recommend backing up to iCloud, which says that it will automatically back up your camera roll, accounts, documents, and settings. Then, do a full backup to iTunes by clicking Back Up when you plug in your iOS device. and you can remove the folder Mobile Applications on Windows or Mac by navigating to the Users\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Mobile Applications folder (actual folder names may vary based on operating system).\nPictures\nDeleting the Mobile Applications Folder\n\nLook at the directory path at the bottom of the picture, too.\n", "Q: Transferring purchases from iPhone to iTunes - Why is it necessary? When trying to restore my iPhone 5s to 7.0.4 via iTunes I get this message:\n\nThere are purchased items on the iPhone “X’s iPhone” that have not been transferred to your iTunes library. You should transfer these items to your iTunes library before updating this iPhone.

I thought all my purchases were linked to my iTunes account. Can't I just re-download all my purchases from the iTunes App Store?\nIs this to make sure apps that are no longer available in the app store are saved?\n\nA: As you said, Apple knows what you have purchased and they are all linked to your account. However, transferring your purchases means that the purchased files (apps, music, movies…) will copy from your device (iPhone 5s) to your computer then you don't need to re-download them from the internet.\n", "Q: Can iCloud do two-way photo syncing (deletion) between the iPhone and a PC? This is a follow-on question from this earlier one.\nI want to be able to have iPhone <--> PC photo syncing such that when I delete a photo from the synced folder in Windows Explorer on the PC, it is automatically deleted from the iPhone 'in sync'. The premise for this is that after taking dozens of shots in a photo shoot and then editing on the Windows PC, and then deleting the ones I don't like etc. (or all of them in moving them outside the folder to be edited elsewhere on the PC), I'm not left with unwanted photos on the iPhone device which I no longer want.\nI've downloaded and set up iCloud Control Panel 3.1 for Windows; when I delete a photo from my iPhone camera photos, it correctly syncs the 'deletion' of that photo to the Windows PC - but not the other way around. Is this limitation deliberate, or a bug of some kind, and if the former, short of jailbreaking the iPhone for an unofficial third-party solution for this, is there any way to do what I want to do?\nN.B. I do not plan on using Mac OS for my aforementioned Desktop image editing needs.\n\nA: I have good news for you this time: this functionality is possible by setting up a Photo Stream on iCloud. The only downside to this method is that you will need to back up your Photo Stream every once in a while.\nFollow these set up instructions, and then use this troubleshooting guide and FAQ page if you have any follow-up questions. The set-up instructions are comprehensive, but I've summarized the steps below:\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone, in your settings, tap iCloud > Photo Stream, then switch My Photo Stream on.\n\n*On your PC, open your iCloud Control Panel, then check the Photo Stream checkbox, then click the Apply button.\n\nNote: Photo Stream was reworded to Photos between iOS 6 and iOS 7; same for Windows 7 and Windows 8.\nNow, to directly answer your concern about deletions, this deletions guide explains how to delete photos from the Photo Stream depending on what device you want to delete them from. Below I've summarized the relevant pieces of information:\nNote: The following assumes you have iCloud Control Panel 3.1 for Windows, iOS 7, and Windows 7; if you have other specs, refer to the entire deletions guide link above.\nDelete photos from iPhone\n\n*\n\n*Open the Photos app, then tap Albums > My Photo Stream > Select, then tap one or more photos, and then tap the Trash icon. Then confirm the number of deleted photos by tapping the Delete N Photos dialog box, where N is the number of photos your checked to delete. The changes should then be reflected once you view your Photo Stream on your PC.\n\nDelete photos from PC\n\n*\n\n*Open a Windows Explorer window, and select Photos under Favorites in the side panel. Then double-click My Photo Stream to open it, and then select the photo or photos you want to delete. Right-click and select Delete. The changes should then be reflected once you view your Photo Stream on your iPhone.\n\nOnce again, to confirm, I asked an Apple Support rep the following question:\n\nI want to use iCloud to do two-way photo synchronization between iPhone to PC so that when I sync photos from my iPhone to my PC, I can edit/delete them on my PC, and then have those edits/deletions be reflected automatically on my iPhone.\n\nThe response I got was the following:\n\nTwo-way photo syncing is possible using Photo Stream between iPhone and PC.\n\nIn case you ever do switch to a Mac, I believe two-way syncing is also possible between an iPhone and a Mac computer.\nLastly, you must occasionally archive and back up your Photo Stream\nAs specified in the FAQ page (linked above):\n\nThe photos on iCloud via My Photo Stream are only available for download for 30 days.\n\nThis is because your Photo Stream storage is separate from your iCloud storage. Therefore, you must archive your data to back it up permanently. The instructions for archiving and backing up are a bit long to get through, but hopefully it will be worthwhile in the long run.\n\nA: As per the requirements and criteria of my question's description:\n\nThe premise ... is that after taking dozens of shots ... and then deleting the ones I don't\n  like ... I'm not left with ... photos on the iPhone device\n  which I no longer want.\n\nI can answer that NO, Apple does NOT provide a way to two-way sync iPhone device photos. iCloud's two-way syncing between a PC and an iPhone only works for the 'My Photo Stream' folder. What I was looking at on the iPhone, where I was not seeing photos being deleted by PC two-way sync, was the Photos tab in the iOS Photos app - the default view of the Photos app when the user first starts using iOS. This is actually the Camera Roll folder, and there is no way to do two-way sync with these original iPhone images on the device using iCloud (or any other service).\nHowever, to answer the question's (more open) title itself: YES, Apple DOES provide two-way sync between the iPhone and a PC, BUT only for sharing/syncing selected photos from the device (and only for 30 days at that) - NOT for editing, or managing the original set of Photos on your iPhone device. To see the (near simultaneous) two-way sync in action on the iPhone, go to the Albums tab in the Photo app where in the My Photo Stream folder you see as it currently designed. To manage or delete original photos themselves, you will have to manually delete and edit them via non-cloud-syncing methods.\n", "Q: Accidentally removed pbcopy I messed up pbcopy. Instead of\n cat foo | pbcopy\n\nI did\n  cat foo > pbcopy\n\nAnd now my pbcopy is a text file. How can I reinstall it? Is it a part of some specific package, maybe something in homebrew?\n\nA: Unless you ran these commands in the directory /usr/bin, and with root privileges, you have not overwritten the real pbcopy - you've simply created a new file in your current working directory with the same name.\nSo - you most likely do not have to reinstall pbcopy. To verify, you can call the full program explicitly, like this:\ncat foo | /usr/bin/pbcopy\n\nwhich should work properly. If it does, you can delete the pbcopy you inadvertently created safely...\n\nA: The pbcopy binary comes from the OS X base installation and you can restore it from Time Machine (either a local snapshot or an external drive) will have copies of that file.\nNext, you could open the installer in a program like Pacifist and extract that binary.\nWorst case, rerun the installer or get a copy of the binary from a trusted source and you should be good to go as long as the source is the same level as your OS.\n", "Q: How to view previous inputted MAC Address for WiFi network I have a Belkin Router and accidentally changed the MAC Address for the Wireless Area Network.

For example iBooks for Mac is known for working a bit differently than iBooks for iOS hence a question.\n\n*Is it likely that Apple will support all of those devices the same with future updates of iOS and iBooks app?\n\n\nPlease note that pixel density (i.e. Retina display), speed differences and less processing power are not issue in this question. What matters is rendering of books.\nI saw 'Other than size, what's the difference between the iPad Air and the Retina iPad mini?' question, but answers do not provide neccessary details about iBooks specifically.\n\nA: I don't believe there are any software differences at all between an iPad mini and an iPad 2 or iPad Air. Both iPad minis use the exact same display resolution as their larger counterparts (1024x768 non-retina, 2048x1536 retina), just on a physically smaller screen. The whole purpose of this is to ensure that all existing software works identically on both device sizes.\nIn fact, I don't think it's even possible for an app to \"know\" which size device it's running on, since there's no technical way to differentiate them. Apple's own iOS Simulator doesn't even list the iPad mini as a separate device to simulate: the only options are iPad (meaning 1024x768) and iPad Retina (meaning 2048x1536).\n", "Q: Missing Safari-plugin for audio/MIDI I am using Mac OS X 10.9.1 (Mavericks) on a late 2012 27\" iMac, running Safari 7.0.1 and I always install all new software updates.\nBut now I have a problem with midi-files that are embedded in websites (like wikipedia, take http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality as an example). When I click on one of those midi-files I expect to hear music. But instead I get an error message telling me that there is no plugin for content of the type \"audio/midi\".\nWhere can I download the missing plugin?\nI am not really shure, but I believe that playing midi files from a website was no problem in previous versions of OS X. Is this a bug in Mavericks?\n\nEDIT 1 (Nov 2014):\nThis question is almost one year old and has more then 10,000 views, but is still left without an useful answer. And midi is still not supported by Safari 8 and Yosemite.\nI do NOT want to download outdated software to use a widely used feature that was supported for many years and is neither a security risk nor any other harm to any computer, just because Apples developers are too reluctant and lame to continue supporting such a simple file format. And I do NOT want to download files and later open them with some other software.\nWhat I want is this:\nA plugin for Safari that I can install additionally to any other plugins (meaning: leave the newest Quicktime-plugin as it is and additionally install a new midi-plugin that is independent from Quicktime) to be able to hear music when I click onto a link to a midi-file in a html-document like this.\n\nEDIT 2 (Dec 2014, when starting the bounty):\n12,000+ views and still no useful answer.\nTo win the bounty please post a link to a site where you can download a plugin for Safari that is independent from Quicktime, that can be installed without replacing Quicktime to make it possible to play music that is encoded in Midi-files, like Quicktime did in previous times, just by clicking on a link to a midi-file.\n\nEDIT 3 (May 2015):\n20,000+ views and still no useful answer.  \nI can't believe, that there is really no plugin for Safari (or other browsers running on an iMac; OS X) that is able to play midi-music.\nAs with any other audio file that is linked in a website, I just want to click on it and do no other extras to hear the music that is stored in this file.\nHey, this worked already 20 years ago, in 1995, in the first days of Internet.

Apparently, in their view, ALL plugins (or at any rate all NPAPI plugins) are dangerous, and the last one (Flash) is only tolerated because of the level of discontent that would result if it were blocked too.  Most other modern browsers are also headed in that direction, if they're not there already.  Older Firefox ESR versions, and perhaps a few other browsers, may still be able to use arbitrary NPAPI plugins; but those browsers may be a risk (not well maintained, or not maintained at all).\nYou can slightly improve on the use of MIDI Player X, by enabling auto-open of files with the \"mid\" extension by Safari (see How to automatically open files downloaded from Safari? but replace torrent in their example with mid) and by setting auto-play (click the words until they turn blue) in MIDI Player X.  Restart Safari after creating the file described in the link.\nThis will NOT do any good for HTML coding embed tags, nor will it avoid leaving a copy of the file in your Downloads directory; but it will at least allow clicking on an href link to a file with the \"mid\" extension to play the file without further action being required.\nedit: a solution that provides playback similar to a MIDI plugin is possible on modern browsers, but requires web page changes.  See http://www.midijs.net and try some of the examples.  Still no help with existing web pages not under your control that use embed tags.\n\nA: MIDIPlayer X from the Mac App store - £0.79 in UK. Simply drop the MIDI file on to the app.\n\nA: I have had the same problem trying to download midi music files.  I get around the problem by downloading the link and opening the file using Finale (MakeMusic software).  It is a bit of a nuisance because I cannot preview the file before downloading and opening, but at least I am successful.  I hope this problem is solved by Safari in the future.

So if you want speed, go Thunderbolt ! \n\nA: My Late 2011 MacBook Pro has Firewire as well, which if you are price conscious may be the way to go, as you can find a Firewire 800 disk enclosure for far cheaper than Thunderbolt. Firewire 800 also performs better than USB 2.

Mid-2010).\nRecently, the HFS+ filesystem on my OSX became corrupt and after many trials and errors, it was clear I was going to need to backup, format, and reinstall OSX. After I got OSX reinstalled (10.6.8), I updated to 10.9.1 and everything seemed to be working properly. However, I booted into Ubuntu and found that the boot loader couldn't find my filesystem and I was getting a grub rescue screen. I followed the first half of this answer (up until normal), and my grub menu appeared, untouched.\nNow, when I continue following the instructions, it says to reinstall grub. So beforehand, I did a little look into the partition setup to make sure that I was installing it in the right place (I want to install it on my boot loader, not in the root partition. That way I can use rEFInd or hold the alt/option key to select if I want to boot into Ubuntu or OSX, then upon choosing Ubuntu I'll see the grub menu. Obviously this case isn't ideal because I get to choose twice which operating system, but I don't want to mess up anything with the EFI startup... we all know how crabby it can get).\nUpon looking into the partitions on Ubuntu, I found that GParted is seeing a Recovery HD partition and fdisk -l isn't. So, to GParted /dev/sda3 is the recovery partition, but to fdisk -l, I'm seeing /dev/sda3 as the boot partition... I figured that the offset between the two is creating weird behavior on startup. Even if that's not the case, I want to get this figured out before reinstalling grub so I know where I'm installing it.\nDoes anyone know why there are inconsistencies between the two records? Is OSX not hiding the recovery partition properly, or should it not be there at all? Generally, I want to know how I can get these records consistent, and if that requires removing the recovery partition (which I've never seen before!), that's fine with me.\nFor the record, the recovery partition isn't showing up in Disk Utility, but it does show up when I run diskutil list in OSX's terminal. Also, to set up my partitions, I followed my own answer here. As you can see by the screen shots, GParted was not detecting the recovery partition before formatting and reinstalling OSX.\n\nEdit: Ubuntu users -- I've linked to this question as part of an answer here if you're having an issue with grub rescue after reinstalling or making chances to OSX.\n\n\nA: OS X creates the recovery partition as an alternate boot solution for ease of reinstallation and troubleshooting.\nIt is not needed for normal operation, and as someone that's familiar with boot technology and options, the simplest option would be to simply delete the partition entirely and patch the partition table if needed.\nHere is a stock layout:\nMac:~ me$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            250.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\nYou could merge partitions disk0s3 into the partition that precedes it (in this case) to effectively erase and then delete the Apple_Boot partition listed as Recovery HD. In this case, you would need to be booted to some other drive than disk0 to have both disk0s2 and disk0s3 unmountable (which would make them disk1 or higher in all likelihood).\n diskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ \"Macintosh HD\" disk0s2 disk0s3\n\nShould that not work, you might have to image Macintosh HD to another drive as an img file (or straight partition to partition) and then repartition hdisk0 to have just one partition and restore.\n\nAs to the deeper question, my guess is that the \"hiding\" of the partition isn't compatible with other non Apple tools and is confusing the issue - hence the advice to just remove it and count on alternate options to restore your system or boot externally in stead of the recovery HD.\n", "Q: How to use 802.1X authentication with Edimax EW-7811Un USB Wi-Fii adapter?

I would start by reading Apple's standard software license agreements and decide if you want to have a layered deployment where some apps come from corporate and some personal Apple ID or if you need to do a little more planning before knowing what option fits your needs best.\nThe cost of labor calculation is the one I see businesses mis-estimate substantially as they sometimes fail to estimate how interested or capable their employees are in self-servicing their computers as well as how effective iterative solutions and building a team that can self-solve and self-train is not only for making good choices for trivial tasks like app updates, but also for productively using technology to solve business problems in general.\nBy managing the attention and energy of employees, sometimes you will want to make different choices and looking at computer management in isolation can yield a good solution, but taking a broader view and self-assesing where the business needs to head can color the tactical choices you make for managing computing assets.\n\nA: I'm surprised that no one has mentioned OSX Server, or Apple Configurator.\nhttp://www.apple.com/osx/server/\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12\n", "Q: Shell Script for Yesterday's Date I'm trying to execute the following shellscript with hazel app on any file in the folder.

I tried to share the partition (on Windows) but that still doesn't work. Hope someone can help me. Thanks.\n\nA: Windows cannot write to Apple Journaled partitions.  OS X cannot write to NTFS. So you'll need to choose something FAT-based.\nThere are third-party solutions to allow writing of course but I've never found the performance hit to be worth versus just going with FAT.\nNote that doing three partitions with Bootcamp can be tricky. I recommend so research on that subject.\n", "Q: Can the 13ʺ MacBook Pro satisfactorily drive two Thunderbolt displays? The new 13ʺ Retina MacBook Pros have 2 Thunderbolt ports, and Apple appears to indicate you can plug in and use 2 Thunderbolt displays with them, but is the video performance satisfactory when doing so? I'm not planning on doing anything that graphically intensive, but I wanted to make sure that the performance was still fine. (Also, I'll be using the MBP in clamshell mode, so I'll only be driving 2 TB displays, not 2 TB displays and the laptop screen.)\n\nA: Yes - the CPU/GPU are powered up enough for two external screens in my experience.\nMy experience is Apple won't bless as supported configurations where the majority of users will see laggy performance that cannot be tuned if needed with a firmware update or better drivers.\nThe higher end 15 inch retina MBP can crank out many more pixels, but the situation you mention with two TB displays with the Mac operating in closed-clamshell mode actually is less pixels to drive than the situation of one display and the internal display still running.\n\nA: I run a 15\" Macbook Pro Retina with two thunderbolt displays in clamshell mode.  I have them daisy chained one to the other, then to the laptop.  This configuration allows me to only plug/unplug one cable for all peripherals.  I have had no lagging, video rendering trouble or over-heating.  \nI run them at native resolutions and it looks beautiful.  I occasionally use graphics and video editing and playback software without reservation or degradation.  I also have VM's running that show no lag.\nI don't have statistics or links to back this up, only experience.\n* EDIT - Adding screen shots of configuration *\n\n\n\nA: If it's Apple Thunderbolt Display with a resolution of 2560x1440, I would say it might be quite disappointing.\nMy 15\" MacBook Pro has a GT 650M, which is much more capable than the built-in Intel graphics. However, driving 3 1080p displays has given it quite some hard time, the UI is not as responsive.\nIt will work, won't be very disappointing, but doesn't live up to Apple standards.\nAlso, what application you run will affect you performance, what will you run?\n", "Q: Auto-fill username and password in Fluid.app webapp I'd like to have my Fluid.app webapps auto-login to various sites (Gmail, DropBox, etc.) using passwords stored in AgileBits 1Password.app.\nI'd appreciate directions or suggestions on how to go about this, if it is possible.\n\nA: 1Password only integrates with a browser that supplies an API which Fluid does not see this thread on AgileBit's website and Fluid does not seem to be able to read any OS APIs to get stored information \nPatrick Welker has used using Keyboard maestro to copy around but this uses Apple's keychain, I have not tried this\n", "Q: Doing a clean install of Mavericks and installing iWorks 09 and the new iWorks for OS 10.9x I already have iWork 09 apps on my Mac's Mountain Lion installation.  I want to do a clean install of Mac OS 10.9x Mavericks on my machine.  This will wipe out the old iWork 09 apps and when I go to install iWork from the App Store it will be the new iWorks 2013.  But I also want to have iWork 09 on my clean installed Mavericks Mac.  Any suggestions for how to do this?  My license for iWork 09 is through the App Store.\nEveryone keeps writing how the old iWork will be kept and the new iWork suite won't write over it.  However, this only applies if you're not doing a clean install, obviously.  However, I need to do a clean install and have both versions of iWork running on the new installation...\n\nA: Or if it feels safer:\n1)  make a clone or Time Machine backup of your current OS before upgrade. 2) Once you have the clean install working effectively, make a copy of your previous OS clone (call it Clone2)\n3) Mount Clone 2, delete all applications except iWork 09 (and any others you want to port). \n4) Open Migration assistant and check 'Applications' only. Commit.\nMA will now copy iWork O9 and its preferences / key to the new OS without affecting anything else.\nCaveat(s): \n- This may overwrite iWork preferences for a later version - but generally not on Apple as they are named differently. For example, I have 4 versions of Apple iMovie on one of my Macs for old projects. \n- Bear in mind that porting an older programme over does not ensure that it will run well on the new OS. Make sure that the two are compatible first (forum search). There may be a soft hack to resolve an issue in some cases. For example, I like to run an older version of 'Text Edit' (with zoom control) from 10.6 under 10.8+ although I have to use a command line control to turn off its auto-save feature as this is now done through the OS. Without this it has a constant nag message 'you do not have permission to save this file'. \n\nA: Make a copy of the iWork '09 folder before you do your clean install.\nOnce the install is complete, move the folder back. The apps will work fine, however your preferences will be lost (although this is probably what you're going for with a clean install). Your 'licence' will be kept as it is stored in the app package.\n", "Q: Move mail boxes data to external drive on Mac Mail on Mavericks I have read, and search one blog to another, one question that seamed what I wanted. I do not want to move the whole Mailbox or configuration to another drive but want to free up some disk space by moving some mail boxes/folders to another drive without losing the mails. The closest to what I want are these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Mac Mail\n\n*Move the .mbox folders that one wants on ~/Library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes to external drive\n\n*Do a Symlink on ~/Library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes pointing to /Volumes/<drive name>/<location of .mbox folder> (doing on a Terminal Window or by right-clicking on the folders on Finder)\n\n*Open Mail and the Boxes should be using the ones on the HD\n\n\nI've done this on Mail on OS X Mavericks. The Boxes are there but no mails can be read. Can someone help me if I'm missing steps or have to do it differently on Mavericks?\n\nA: I believe Mail updates the .mbox file each time it closes which basically overwrites the symlink.\nYou could consider trying to symlink in the other direction as spelled out here on Mac OSX Hints or alternatively symlink a parent directory of the .mbox instead since it does not get rewritten.\n", "Q: Reinstalling from Time Machine, what changes? I'm having an issue that seems may be resolved by formatting and reinstalling, but if I do this and then recover from Time Machine during the install (assuming a backup just prior to the format), would anything be different? My issue may be the result of some kind of corrupted file associations or something so if the restore operation is a copy it may fix it, but if it's a bit for bit backup I don't see it making a difference. \nIf it matters, I have a early 2013 Retina MBP which has an SSD. \n\nA: As a rule of thumb system files are preserved from the fresh install and your data is copied from the Time Machine.\nYou've mentioned file associations — I presume you're referring to file associations with your own files, and therefore a Time Machine restore would copy those associations. The main exception to this is if the application that the file is associated with is missing. Then the file would change it's association to the 'next best' app.\n\nFrom the rule of thumb you can generally guess what'll be restored and what'll be left alone, but feel free to add more specific detail to your question.\n", "Q: Purge command - Unable to purge disk buffers, error #-2? When I attempt to run the purge command, I get the same error every time.\n[ERROR] <CPDevice.c:3816>   Unable to create new counter client.\n[ERROR] <CPOSX.c:1172>  Unable to get user client so as to poke the kernel. \nUnable to purge disk buffers, error #-2.\n\nI've tried with and without sudo, initially thinking that perhaps it's unable to due to not having proper access, and they simply didn't program in a permissions check. It's the same error though.\nI have a dual Xcode installation, which I believe may be the issue here. I have 3.2.6 installed to a custom directory (/Xcode 3) and I have Xcode 4.6.3 from the Mac App Store. I've installed the most recent (2013.4) Command Line Tools from within Xcode 4. I'm running OS X 10.7.4 Lion.\nBefore anyone tells me that I should let the OS manage inactive memory on it's own because it does it fine, no, it doesn't. Not in the slightest. Normally it works well enough not to bother me. But whenever I use any type of VM, I encounter issues with the memory never releasing. \nFor example, I can start an instance of an emulation VM. It'll use about 600 MB of memory. When I terminate the emulation entirely, the memory does not release. On top of that, if I go back and rerun the exact same emulation, the 600 MB sitting in inactive doesn't get reused like one might hope. No, it just sits there. And another 600 from the free pool gets used. And when that second emulation is terminated, I now have 1.2 GB of inactive memory. Now normally this would be fine, if the inactive memory released when all the free memory was used. But it doesn't. It just sits there and never releases. It'll swap to disk instead. \nThis issue is particularly annoying with virtualization VMs that use 4 GB or even more of RAM within my normal usage. Restart those more than once and new things slow to a crawl due to disk swapping.\nI used to use the purge command all the time on 10.5 Leopard with Xcode 3.1.4, and issues on Leopard weren't nearly this bad with automatic memory management. I just used purge to get more of a clean slate without having to reboot. I can't even do that now. And unlike some people would tell you, it is a serious problem.\nAny ideas would be appreciated. One more thing. I have used xcode-select to select Xcode 4.6.3 as opposed to 3.2.6. I only use 3.2.6 for development and compiling. Macports, Homebrew, and some other things, demand Xcode 4 to be installed and selected though, which is the only reason I have it. But if I remember correctly, purge also didn't work when I had Xcode 3 selected instead.\n\nA: Privilege needed\nOn Mountain Lion purge can be run from a normal user account.\nOn Mavericks purge can only be run from root account (through sudo).\nIf you attempt to run it with a normal user account, you will get an error message:\nUnable to purge disk buffers: Operation not permitted\n\nReal function\npurge doesn't act directly on main memory.\nIts core function is to terminate all the IO pending which are using disk cache and then to\nfree all the occupied disk cache.\npurge should free disk space to ease paging out and swapping out of main memory. Hence many people get convinced that purge was freeing main memory. This is an urban legend.\nReal fault\nThis problem is clearly coming directly from the MacOS X kernel.\nIt might be caused by programs doing a lot of I/O on a system where the virtual memory is already heavily used. But these programs are false culprits.\nYou may find such a false culprit exhibited here: Mountain Lion Panic - decode\nA kernel panic is a kernel fault. The type of error message is a kernel error message. It is a kernel fault.\nFrom your actual context, I advise you to run sysdiagnose and open a bug case at Apple with the result. This tool will run for you all the relevant tools to analyze any misbehaviour of your system or anny application running on it.\nPlease read this professionnal answer: Apple sysdiagnose\n", "Q: Where are Time Machine local backups/snapshots stored? Out of curiosity, I'm wondering where in the file system Time Machine stores its local backups/snapshots.\n\nA: They are stored on your hard drive in the folder entitled:\n/Volumes/MobileBackups\n\nNote: This answer is now dated and incorrect for current MacOS versions. It was accurate for MacOS Lion, but has changed since that time. See other answers for updated locations.\n\nA: Under the new file system in High Sierra (Apple File System (APFS)), this it is different.  You can see what is considered the \"local backups\" via command line like this:\nsudo tmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nOnes that are listed as \"(dateless)\" will cause all sorts of problems:\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2017-12-23-090037 (dataless)\n\nso you can delete any backup by command line like this (deletes the one listed above, note only date used in reference):\nsudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2017-12-23-090037\n\nNote that in my latest problem with macOS, the \"bird\" process was eating up egregious amounts of CPU. It was suggested that dumping backups that were damaged (damaged, who knew?) would help.\n\nA: The actual data is stored in a hidden directory called .MobileBackups at the root of the volume.\nThere is a special virtual filesystem type called mtmfs which translates the raw data in these hidden directories into a virtual Time Machine drive which is automatically mounted on /Volumes/MobileBackups\nThis mechanism of storing local backups existed on HFS format file systems and is no longer how things work on APFS Macs. Snapshots now are built in to the filesystem as opposed to needing to make “shadow copies” of files in a new location, the “shadow copies” are of the whole disk state.\n\n*\n\n*Now that disablelocal is gone, how to stop local (internal drive) TimeMachine backups?\n\nA: On Catalina they seem to be in:\n/Volumes/com.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots\n\n", "Q: Setting up key bindings of Corsair Vengeance K70 to work with OS X I recently purchased a Corsair Vengeance K70 and am trying to get set the ctrl windows alt keys to match the ones on a mac keyboard, control option(alt) command.

Interestingly, the remote application didn't think it had lost the connection so somehow it still received and acknowledged the remote commands.\nHere is the relevant /var/log/system.log output from the moment it happened:\nJan  3 10:39:19 knifen.local WindowServer[119]: CGXCreateShmem : mach_make_memory_entry(268453900: unknown error code) : Cannot map memory\nJan  3 10:39:19 knifen.local WindowServer[119]: _CGXCreateWindowInline: Creation failure 1007\nJan  3 10:39:19 knifen.local Dock[15204]: CGSNewWindowWithOpaqueShape: Cannot create window\nJan  3 10:39:19 knifen.local WindowServer[119]: CGXCreateShmem : mach_make_memory_entry(268453900: unknown error code) : Cannot map memory\nJan  3 10:39:19 knifen.local WindowServer[119]: _CGXCreateWindowInline: Creation failure 1007\nJan  3 10:39:19 knifen.local Dock[15204]: CGSNewWindowWithOpaqueShape: Cannot create window\nJan  3 10:39:28 knifen.local WindowServer[119]: BUG in libdispatch: 13A603 - 2930 - 0x1000480c\nJan  3 10:39:51 knifen kernel[0]: IOHIDSystem: postEvent LLEventQueue overflow.\nJan  3 10:40:50 knifen.local Spotify[13941]: Got disconnected: Error Domain=GCDAsyncSocketErrorDomain Code=4 \"Read operation timed out\" UserInfo=0xfa075f0 {NSLocalizedDescription=Read operation timed out}\nJan  3 10:40:55 knifen kernel[0]: IOHIDSystem: postEvent LLEventQueue overflow.\nJan  3 10:41:50 knifen.local hidd[95]: IOHIDEventQueue unable to get policy for event of type 11.

It seems to be bad engineering on Apple's part.\n\nA: When the OS is starved for room on disk, bad things happen by design in an effort to try to keep the critical parts of the system online long enough to let a controlled crash happen and potentially let apps with changes to save survive until the cleanup activity starts.\nMavericks is much less likely to allocate the full amount of RAM to /var/db/sleepimage so people used to having that space preallocated can run into surprises when the OS needs a little room to grow the sleep image if operating conditions dictate.\nThe main tip would be to preserve several gigabytes of free space on the bootable volume when you have a workload that stresses the virtual memory system and runs with memory pressure in the red. \nHere are my recommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*What scale or measure does Mavericks' and Yosemite's \"memory pressure\" adhere to? has some good information on monitoring and causing memory pressure on command\n\n*boot your system, log in one user, quit all applications\n\n*open activity monitor and observe / record the memory screen\n\n*put the machine to sleep and wake it 30 seconds later\n\n*run sudo du -sm /var/vm/* and note how large your sleep image file is as well as whether any swap files have been created on disk.\n\n\nYou will want to have ideally enough space on disk free to match your total memory footprint if you intend to run programs that take the virtual memory system into yellow territory for memory pressure. You probably won't need all that space for just the OS, but especially if you are getting mach memory errors like you are listing, the workload you are running needs a little more free space to grow than you are allowing.\nAdditionally, if you feel the system tuning is incorrect, you could easily file a bug report by running sysdiagnose after a clean boot as described above, once again when the system is running the intended workload properly and one last sydiagnose run once you've caused the memory allocations to start breaking the system. It's possible there are better choices Apple could have made, but it also could just be your software is buggy / leaking memory and the system is breaking as it was intended when the finite resources it has have become exhausted. Without more details it's hard to tell which is the case.\n\nA: \"shmem\" is shared memory, and OS X is failing to allocate shared memory. It therefore seems the computer has run out of memory, both RAM and hard drive memory. Is this the case? At the time of freeze, there seemed to be about 1GB of space left.\n\n\n*\n\n*Free up disk space by deleting files\n\n*Free up memory by closing applications\n\n\nIn this particular case, the logs later indicated that Spotlight had been trying to index a mounted sparsebundle volume, resulting in the backing disk running out of space.\n", "Q: Macbook2,1 late 2006 fan not spinning My macbook is very hot, the fan never starts. I tried some softwares like Fan Control 1.2, scmfancontrol 2.4 and Macs Fan Control but each of them is giving me always 0 rpm on the main (right) fan…\nWhy? What can I do?\nThe system is a very fresh install of Lion, updated to the last, 10.7.5\nPs: I remember that before going to reinstall it, a manual control on the fan was working...\n\nA: Zero for fan speed can be often a sign phisical damage of a fan or its connector. If resetting of SMC won't help, then it is what I said.\n\nA: Reset the SMC on a MacBook with removable battery\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown and disconnect your charger\n\n*Remove the battery.\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds, then release.\n\n*Connect the charger and press the power button to turn your Mac back on.\n\n\nReset NVRAM\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown.\n\n*Boot whilst holding ⇧⌥PR until the second chime.\n\n\nA: If one attempt at resetting the SMC didn't revive the fan, then I would say the fan has failed and you will need to reseat the fan cable or replace the fan to tell if it's the fan itself or something on the logic board that has failed.\nAlso, before spending money, I would try installing a clean OS X onto a USB stick or SD card just to be sure it's not software or the SMC modification tools you have installed that are causing the issue. Unlikely, but you'd hate to spend money on a software issue.\n", "Q: How to manually restore a iTunes and iPhoto Library? I recently moved to OSX Mavericks from Snow Leopard. I made a copy with Time Machine, perform a clean install and restored some data with the Time Machine backup.\nI first tried to recover everything. The SO was a little bit buggy so I wanted to make a better clean installation, so I format again and restored only data and settings. The system is now even more buggy.\nSo I decided to perform a completely clean install and manually recover all the data I need. To do this I have to manually save all my data. But how can I backup my iPhoto and iTunes libraries? I want to have all the same information I have now, in the new clean system.\n\nA: Your iPhoto library (by default) is located in ~/Pictures as a package (.photolibrary).\nYour iTunes library (by default) is located in ~/Music as a folder.\nCopying the entire library will copy all the data (unless you are using referenced media). Your app settings are located in ~/Library/Preferences.\n\nA: I also just did this, as my previous machines' backup was just littered with old cruft I didn't want to pollute my shiny new computer with :)\nI used the built-in terminal command 'rsync' which is a sophisticated Unix file copy tool. It may be overkill for you, but this did the trick for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, navigate to your Time Machine backup.\n\n*Drill down to Macintosh HD > Users > your name. This will make sure the Time Machine back up data is available.\n\n*Run Terminal\n\n*The following command (tailored for your username) will copy everything from your Pictures folder in the Time Machine backup to your local drive:\nrsync --archive --stats --human-readable --progress /Volumes/Time\\ Machine\\ Backups/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/<your name>/Pictures/ ~/Pictures\n\n\n*The following command (tailored for your username) will copy everything from your Pictures folder in the Time Machine backup to your local drive:\nrsync --archive --stats --human-readable --progress /Volumes/Time\\ Machine\\ Backups/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/<your name>/Music/ ~/Music\n\nThis will take time, depending on the size of your libraries - took 4 hours for me, but on slow wireless. Wired or local Time Machine drive will be much quicker.\nThe reason for the complex command is:\n--archive preserves timestamps, ownership, aliases, etc.\n--human-readable uses notation like '12.3MB' instead of '12305405 bytes'\n--stats gives you summary statistics at the end\n--progress gives you file-by-file progress report at Terminal.\nThe end result is that your iPhoto and iTunes libraries will be cloned to their new location and look and feel precisely like the originals - everything should be intact. At least, this worked perfectly for me two weeks ago using Mavericks.\n", "Q: Will restoring from TimeMachine keep my bootcamp partition intact? I am going to install Mavericks from the scratch, formatting the Mac partition.\nThen, using TimeMachine I will restore my data and applications.\nThe bootcamp partition was excluded from the TimeMachine backup. \nIf I restore my copy with TimeMachine, will it keep intact the bootcamp partition as it was not backed up?\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes it will.\nAs long as you only erase your Mac partition, the Boot Camp partition will be untouched. Time Machine will only modify the Mac partition.\n\nA: The action that will cause data loss is the formatting and re-partition that happens before you get the opportunity to reload from your Time Machine backup.\nThe normal process is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify last backup of any data you wish not to risk (BootCamp and Mac partitions should be backed up just in case)\n\n*Erase the parts of the drive you wish to clear or clean\n\n*Reinstall OS X onto the Macintosh HD part of the drive\n\n*Start the restore process from the Recovery HD, from another bootable OS X source or from the Migration Assistant running from the newly reinstalled OS X partition\n\n\nWhen you go to load a Time Machine (or any other backup) as long as you didn't erase the Boot Camp data partition as part of the formatting or reinstallation steps that are already complete, then you won't lose further data such as a Boot Camp partition.\nThe programs that load Time Machine want to write that data to the Macintosh HD side of things and leave the other partitions alone.\n", "Q: Can I access data on Windows outside VMWare from within the OS X VM? I am running OS X Mountain Lion on VMWare Workstation installed on Windows 7. How can I access my Xcode projects outside VMWare (i.e. from host)? I know I can do this by copying projects in the shared folder of my machine.\nCan I have a folder on host where I can create Xcode projects from within VMWare? I want to do this because VMWare may crash and I may want to keep all Xcode projects safe and access them from host.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Sure you can. You don't have to use the shared folders set by VMWare. You can create new ones on you host in the Options > Shared Folders tab in you VM's settings. And they can be located everywhere. I don't know if there are any restrictions from xCode where you project files have be be saved but the new shared folder should be accessible from your OSX VM without any problems.\n", "Q: Terminal problem with Ctrl + Arrow and Shift + Arrow keys I am running Mavericks on a new Macbook Pro. When I use the Ctrl and Shift keys together with the arrow keys, I get some sort of key codes as output in the terminal. I am pretty sure that this problem is new and that it didn't happen a few days ago. But I am not 100% sure. Anyway, this is what happens:\nIf I press Ctrl+← (Left arrow), ;5D is output in the terminal. Similarly:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+→ (Right arrow) outputs ;5C\n\n*Shift+← (Left arrow) outputs ;2D\n\n*Shift+→ (Right arrow) outputs ;2C\nAs I mentioned, I am pretty sure that before today I could use those shortcuts to move between words and select text. Has anyone seen this before? I have already looked through some of the existing questions about arrow key shortcuts, but I have found no references to this exact problem. \nAlso, note that I have turned off the keyboard shortcut that moves between desktops using the Ctrl + arrow keys. \n\nA: The same thing happens on my 10.9 and 10.8 VMs. Control-arrows and shift-arrows don't do anything by default in bash. Where were you even using shift-arrows to select text? emacs or vim?\nIf you want to use control-left and control-right to move between words in bash, add these lines to ~/.inputrc:\n\"\\e[1;5C\": forward-word\n\"\\e[1;5D\": backward-word\n\nTo use shift-arrows in Emacs, map shift-up to \\e[1;2A, shift-down to \\e[1;2B, shift-right to \\e[1;2C, and shift-left to \\e[1;2D. If pressing shift-up results in a message like <select> is undefined, try setting TERM to xterm-vt220.\n\nA: Ctrl+Left/Right are present in Terminal (macOS 10.12) by default (Preferences → Profiles → Keyboard). I tried adding Shift-Up/Down in ~/.inputrc but nothing happened.\n~/.inputrc:\n\n\"\\e[1;2A\": shift-up\n\"\\e[1;2B\": shift-down\n\nInstead I added Shift Up/Down programatically in Terminal Preferences. The problem is that this is stored per profile, of which macOS has a dozen by default, so you have to loop over all the profiles (one named Ocean here) to add the keys for all available profiles. I don't know if plutil or defaults have some magic to make this easy, or if you have to use an XML parser.\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist:\n\n\"Window Settings\" = {\n  Ocean = {\n    keyMapBoundKeys = {\n      \"$F700\" = \"\\033[1;2A\";\n      \"$F701\" = \"\\033[1;2B\";\n\n\nA: In Iterm2 you can do it (I have 3.3.12) and followed this instruction:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1051668/select-full-word-in-iterm2-using-alt-shift-arrow/1216606#1216606?newreg=bd3be1406dcb4aaa856f425d3e5f2c24\nI've set these mappings in Prferences- > Keys but then also had to remove the mappings for shift+arrows from Preferences ->Profile -> Default (they were sending escape sequences there).\nThis may break down the workflow for programs that run inside the terminal like emacs (I did not check) but works great for me for selecting in the command line and in the mcedit (builtin editor of midnight commander) as well.\nThe selection logic is a bit different, it is not following the cursor but for simple cases it works great.\n\nA: An alternative: \nIn Terminal preferences go to Advanced and unselect 'Paste newlines as carriage returns'.\nThen use Sublime to write out complicated com\n", "Q: How to install Apache into a custom directory? How to install a copy of Apache into a local custom directory via Terminal (to ~/Desktop/ for example), so it can live without conflicts with another global version of Apache and I cant start and stop it from there?\n\nA: homebrew\nConsider using homebrew to manage a private, isolated, installation of Apache httpd on your Mac.\nTo install brew and Apache httpd on your Mac, follow the steps on homebrew; the two main steps are:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)\"\n\nThis will install the brew command line tool.\nNext use jabberwik's tap to install httpd:\nbrew tap jabberwik/homebrew-httpd\nbrew install httpd24\n\nMAMP\nAn alternative approach is to use a pre-packaged application, such as MAMP.

I am unable to remove Anyconnect from dock. It persists like Finder. On checking ~/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist I don't find Anyconnect listed in it. Is this setting stored somewhere else from where I can remove?\nI am using Mavericks.\n\nA: Typically you quit a program and then drag the dock icon out of the dock if it remains.

I'd like to be notified by email whenever a message gets sent to my terminal mail, how could I achieve this?\nI see some information about cc'ing in this documentation, but I don't know how to use it in this regard.\n\nA: I assume you are referring to the notice that comes up in Terminal \"You've got mail\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file .forward in your home directory.  (that's a period and the word forward with no space.  In it write the address you want the mail forwarded to. \nThis file has to be owned and readable by your userid.  \n\n*Jobs run by cron by default mail their output to the owner of the crontab file.  This can be overridden by specifying the option MAILTO=userid@somewhere.com at the top of the file.  See man crontab for details.\nThe second only forwards the details of jobs run from that particular crontab. If you have sandboxed services that have individual crontabs on a user basis (E.g. You have a database service that runs a consitency check on the database at 2:30 every morning, and runs that service as user mysql, then you have to add the line to mysql's crontab. \nGeneral best practice for email that goes to non-real users is to forward it to a role first.

This makes it much easier at vacation time to temporarily forward email to your temp sysadmin.\n", "Q: Show all flagged items in Archive in Mail (iOS 7) I am using Mail in iOS 7 on my iPhone 5.\nI was wondering: The \"Flagged\" Mailbox under iOS 7 only shows the flagged items which are in the Inbox, but not in the whole Archive.\nHowever, in Mail for OS X, the Flagged-Mailbox shows ALL flagged items, also when they are any flagged mails in the Archive.\n\nIs there a ways to get this functionality in iOS 7 and Mail?\n\n\nA: In Mail for iOS 7 you can tap on Archive Mailbox then type the word flagged in the search box. You can then pull down on the results list which gives you the option of All Mailboxes, or Current Mailbox, which is actually pretty useful. Selecting All Mailboxes should show all flagged messaged globally, and Current Mailbox only the ones in the Archive that have been flagged. I realize that this is more of a work-around than the way it's done for the normal Inbox, although seems to work relatively well considering there's no actual Flagged button for messages in the Archive. \nI've found that the Flagged button doesn't always show all the flagged items in the Inbox anyway. It appears that it has something to do with flagged messages that are stored on iCloud or possibly doesn't search for flagged messages past a certain date. I usually end up typing flagged in the search and sure enough it finds items that weren't listed when I had initially tapped the Flagged button. After the search completes then older flagged items end up showing when tapping the Flagged button. \n*I believe flagged messages are also put at the top of the message list by default when you tap on the Archive Mailbox (at least on mine). If someone has a better solution it would be nice to know, however, in meantime hopefully this helps.\n", "Q: Does the iPad Air support Wi-Fi Direct? I'd like to use my Seagate Wireless hard drive with my iPad or even my iPhone 5.\n\nA: Whilst the device hardware does support Wi-Fi Direct, the limitation in this case is software.\nThere is currently no software on iOS that connects to a wireless hard drive through Wi-Fi Direct, but that hasn't stopped apps being developed to take advantage of this — Seagate has an app that connects to wireless hard drives:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.seagate.com/gb/en/services-software/apps/seagate-media-app/\n", "Q: Is there a way to automatically delete old boarding passes in Passbook? Is there a way to make old boarding passes go away automatically from Passbook, instead of manually deleting them?\n\nA: In this article, it says:\n\n\"I'm surprised old boarding passes don't automatically delete from\n  Passbook post departure. You have to manually delete them.\"\n\nIt doesn't look like it is possible yet.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html\n\nA: No - passbook items might even be retained on purpose since Apple allows developers to use Apple's push notification service to refresh a passbook with new information that might make them no longer expired.\nIt's up to each developer to decide if they keep sending you one-off passbook items or make them more of a reusable container to store the information you need when you need it.\nThere are clearly cases where this won't work - for boarding passes where you want to be able to perhaps load 3 to 6 of them before an overseas trip, but I would expect Apple to add a clear system if people end up commonly having dozens or more expired items and make a case for that feature to be added.\n\nA: In iOS 11 (possibly earlier) it’s now much easier to delete old passes: In the Wallet, swipe all the way down and tap the “Edit Passes” button (the button only appears if you have more than one pass stored). Then you can easily see the “last updated” dates of all passes and easily delete them from the list.\n", "Q: Is it possible to switch the desktops of multiple displays without moving the mouse? (Mavericks) I have been loving Maverick's new \"Displays have separate spaces\" functionality; however, I have just one issue with it. I usually use a keyboard shortcut to change spaces (i.e.⌘ + → and ⌘ + ←), and this action changes the space of whichever display the mouse is on. When I am working, I dislike having to think about where the mouse is, so I was wondering if it is possible to have something like four keyboard shortcut: two for left/right on the internal display, and two for the left/right on the external display? Or if there was any other convenient solution to this little annoyance?\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro can do this using a macro such as the following:\n\n\nA: After a little more research, I discovered this answer by user60838, and I believe it solves my problem as well.

So to fix this the easiest way would be to simply clear the Dock preferences using this Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) command:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock; killall Dock\n\nFor anyone not familiar with the defaults command, it is used to set or remove preferences, most of the time hidden ones. This line simply uses the defaults command to delete the preferences associated with the bundle ID of com.apple.dock, which is just a unique identifier for Dock.app. If you want to be a little more technical and see if you can salvage your Dock's app order and Stacks, try running\ndefaults read com.apple.dock\n\nand looking for anything suspicious or corrupted, and then use defaults delete on the offending key.\n", "Q: Any cydia App for choosing specific proxy country? Like for those tv apps, in my case, from Spain which will only show certain content if you have a Spanish ip.\nFor me in Germany I thus need some kind of proxy from Spain. Does such an app exist in cydia? Or would there be any other way in order to appear as a Spanish client to the servers of that tv app?\n\nA: This is a non-Cydia solution. I hope it still applies as answer for your question though.\nMaybe you would like to try an app called VyprVPN. It lets you choose your server location basically with a single button. It advertises on its Website as a \"security measure\", but this review states\n\nVyprVPN can be used to bypass website restrictions or bans implemented by certain countries.\n\nI have not tested this app myself, so I cannot \"recommend\" it as such, but I think based on the information provided it should to the job for you. Good luck!\n", "Q: Lion and later: Stop auto launching iTunes on Bluetooth headset connect? iTunes has an annoying habit of auto launching upon connecting a Bluetooth headset to Mac. Pre-Lion, you could go to System Preferences -> CD/DVD Settings, and disable an option for auto launching iTunes.\nHowever, in Macs without a CD/DVD, and post-Lion, up to Mavericks, there is no such setting available. Neither iTunes 11, nor System Preferences 10.9 present a setting to disable this annoyance.\nSome say to disable the iTunes Helper from Users & Groups -> Login Items, but this appears to have no effect.\nIs there another way to change this behavior?\nAlso posted on Reddit.\nAlso posted on Apple Discussions.\n\nA: I'm on a MBP with osx 10.9.2. Disabling iTunes in \"CD and DVD\" preferences does not help. Just renaming iTunes to something else does not work. \nThe service \"Remote Control Daemon\", rdc, is responsible for delivering commands to (for example) iTunes. Use this script, iTunesPatch. This script modifies the actual binary for rdc to inhibit the command it sends to start iTunes, which means that all other functions of rdc still works as expected. \n\nA: Have you tried removing permissions from the Remote Control Daemon?\nsudo chmod -x /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS\n\n(there was a similar thread on Apple Discussions)\n", "Q: Set service keyboard shortcut and have change take effect programtically I have the following script to set a services shortcut:\nset serviceName to \"(null) - VimAnywhere - runWorkflowAsService\"\nset libPrefPath to POSIX path of (path to preferences folder from user domain as text)\nset plistFile to \"pbs.plist\"\nset plistPath to libPrefPath & plistFile as text\nset mainPropertyItem to \"NSServicesStatus\"\nset keyBindingKey to \"key_equivalent\"\nset keyBinding to \"^@v\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  set gp to (get property list item serviceName of property list item mainPropertyItem of property list file plistPath)\n  tell gp\n    set value of property list item keyBindingKey to keyBinding\n  end tell\nend tell\n\ndo shell script \"defaults read > /dev/null\"\n\nThis sets a keyboard shortcut for a service I have defined in the appropriated property list and it even displays properly when viewing in System Preferences. The problem is, the change doesn't seem to take effect. Invoking the keyboard shortcut has no effect.\nHow can I set this shortcut and have it take effect immediately (completely through shell/applescript)?\n\nA: The changes made by the AppleScript are applied for me after I quit and reopen applications.

When the program exits, the terminal window closes as well. Running the above command, if you were to quit Vim, the terminal would go away as well.\nIs there any way to get this (or similar) functionality through Terminal.app (on OSX)? The solution can be in AppleScript, Bash or anything else really, as long as it's achievable via commands I could run in a Bash script.\n\nA: With AppleScript, you can do:\n\non run argv\n    set command to item 1 of argv --you can customize this to be constant\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        activate\n        do script (command & \"; exit\")\n    end tell\nend run\n\nThis will open Terminal and tell it to run a command (Your default settings need to close the window when the shell exits). \nTo run this, just use osascript filename.scpt \"$command_to_run\"\n\nA: You could use the open command (/usr/bin/open). \nFor example, say that I want to open  the file test.txt with Textmate and close the shell afterwards. I could use the following command:\nopen -W -a Textmate test.txt && exit\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The -W option will cause it to wait until Textmate is closed.\n\n*The -A option allows you to specify the application\n\n\nThe second part of the command line (exit) will not cause the Terminal application to quit, but can close the Terminal window if you change the default preferences. In the Terminal preferences, click on the Shell tab and change the setting When the shell exits to Close the window\n\nIf you really want to exit the Terminal application, you could replace exit by a call to a Bash script. For example:\n#!/bin/sh\n\necho | osascript <<EOF\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n  quit\nend tell\nEOF\n\n(Source adapted from Mac OS X Hints)\nThis will still cause Terminal to show a popup asking if you want to close the application.\n\n", "Q: Take screenshot and copy its file path to clipboard I want to have the file path of a screenshot to be available in the clipboard to paste it directly into some text. Greenshot on Windows can do this in just one keyboard shortcut simultaneously taking the screenshot and putting its file path into the clipboard.

I bought an iPhone 5s and gifted it to a friend abroad without opening it and activating it. I was wondering if it's possible for that friend to unlock the iPhone without having to activate it with the original carrier sim card since he doesn't have that sim, and can't get it in his country.\n\nA: No. A factory unlock feeds the unlock status to the collective database that iTunes or the device polls when it does the activation.\nOnce the carrier has confirmed unlock status (or Apple feeds the unlock status to the carriers when you buy an iPhone factory unlocked out of the box) - the next restore event will alert you that the device is now unlocked.\nIn the case of a third party unlock - again, as long as the device sees that it is whitelisted when activation time happens, it doesn't matter who caused your phone's device ID to be cleared - just that it matches perfectly for the unlock to succeed.\n\nA: I have been battling for two months now on this problem.\nI bought an iPhone from someone in the United States, I am in South Africa - but he sent it to me without the original SIM-card. There is nothing I can do - I have called ATT and they say that the only way I can unlock the phone is if I have the original SIM.\nI have confirmation that the phone is 'whitelisted'. I have the email saying all the \"congratulations\" etc., but the 3rd bullet says\n\nEnsure that the original SIM-card is in the phone to be able to unlock with iTunes.\n\nThis really really sucks. Oh and one more thing - because I am not the original owner they will not give me a solution or further details.\n\nA: I ended up buying the unlock service even though I didn't have the original sim card. Fortunately the unlock service wasn't able to unlock the iPhone 5S so they refunded me my money. I ended up going to the mobile operator and explaining my case, and even though I was on contract and had recently bought the phone, they agreed to unlock it.

When I select 'Get Info' for the volume/disk, I see 'You can read only' under 'Sharing & Permissions'. \nI copied a large file from Windows 10 to the USB Drive, worked fine. I then downloaded the file to Mac, worked fine, but won't allow me to write anything from Mac to the USB drive, or make any changes to it eg. delete or rename files on the USB drive.\nMy reason for getting this USB drive formatted in NTFS was to copy files from Mac larger than 4GB to Windows for redundant backup, because of 4GB limit in FAT.\nOne solution I found online was to sudo echo UUID to /etc/fstab\nWhen I diskutil info, I don't get UUID. \nI also see the following extracts:\nFile System Personality:  NTFS\n Type (Bundle):            ntfs\n Name (User Visible):      Windows NT File System (NTFS)\n& \nRead-Only Media:          No\n Read-Only Volume:         Yes\n Ejectable:                Yes\nMy solution was to download Samsung NTFS for Mac Driver from:\nhttps://www.seagate.com/au/en/support/downloads/item/samsung-ntfs-driver-master-dl/\nAfter installation & reboot, I noticed the following changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I select 'Get Info' for the volume/disk, I see 'You can read and write' under 'Sharing & Permissions'.\n\n\n2.\n   File System Personality:  UFSD_NTFS\n   Type (Bundle):            ufsd_NTFS\n   Name (User Visible):      Windows NT Filesystem\n3.\n   Read-Only Media:          No\n   Read-Only Volume:         No\n   Ejectable:                Yes\nThe readme file (pdf) that comes with the download says NTFS features also work in Mac for the USB drive. \nNow I can read/write to the disk, and is also visible in Finder.

I've been developing an iOS application, and I've confirmed that it works fine on the iPhone 4. I have never tested it in a 4th generation iPod touch.\nRecently I distributed the app to several testers (using a service called TestFlight). Only two of them are having problems downloading/installing, and they happen to be 4th generation iPod touch users.\nSo this leads me to my question - will an app that can run on the iPhone 4 be able to do so on a 4th generation iPod touch? Maybe their devices can't download/install the app because they actually can't run it.\nThe question at\n http://store.apple.com/us/question/answers/ipod/will-all-the-iphone-apps-work-on-an-ipod-touch/QTH2T4XUYF29DAUUA says\n\nMost apps will work on the iphone and the ipod touch but some apps\n  will require things that only the ipad or iphone has.\n\nWhat are those specific things that an iPhone 4 may have that are lacking on a 4th generation iPod touch?\nThe app doesn't really do anything fancy. It uses Game Center, it has In-App purchase, an accelerometer... All of that seems to be supported by the iPod touch.\n\nA: As a developer, you can control exactly which hardware you want to support and which you will not support by picking the source code you use and properly tagging the files you upload to Apple.\nThe iOS app store then can prevent the devices you have disallowed from downloading the app. So, there's nothing to prevent a developer from targeting only iPhone 4 with their code or just targeting a specific iOS version.\nIt's up to you (and each other developer) to decide on a build-by-build basis, so the general answer would be:\nNo, there is no guarantee that all apps (or any one app) that run(s) on iPhone 4 will also run on iPod Touch (4th generation).\n\nA: You mention that they're having trouble downloading/installing the app — does the app require iOS 7? The iPod touch 4th generation can't run iOS 7, so apps that require iOS 7 won't install.\n\nThe main hardware limitation of the iPod touch over the iPhone (other than the lack of cellular connectivity) is GPS. All generations of iPod touch don't have 'real' GPS.\n\nFor iPod touch with Maps, the Maps application provides your approximate location using information based on your proximity to known Wi-Fi networks (when on and available). The more accurate the available information, the smaller the circle identifying your position on the map. The feature is not available in all areas. Known Wi-Fi networks are predominantly in urban areas.\n\nSource: Apple — iPod touch — Technical Specifications\nThe iPod touch also doesn't have a compass.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade the Radeon Pro graphics card in my iMac early-2008?

I went to Safari > Preferences > Passwords > Remove All to remove all the stored passwords. But no matter how many times I do it, all of them keep coming back. All autofill options are disabled. I also disabled the cloud keychain on my iPhone. \nI don't want to have any Passwords stored in cloud or anywhere. What am I missing? \n\nA: Found the solution. I searched for keychain in spotlight and found something called Keychain Access. All the passwords were here under Login. When I deleted them from here, it removed them from Safari as well. \nSafari's preference to Remove All just removes the locally stored passwords in Safari and not the ones that are in the user keychain.\nAdditionally, go to System Preferences and make sure that keychain syncing is disabled if you don't want any data stored in iCloud. You can empty that keychain if desired using Keychain Access before disabling the sync for extra security if you are sure no other devices depend on keychain syncing.\n\nA: I had the problem that for a particular website that I would occasionally log in to the username field started autofilling with a huge bunch of gibberish. However, no matter how many times I looked in the Safari saved passwords on my Mac that bit of gibberish was no where to be found, but would also autofill. It would even autofill on my iPhone, but it wasn't in the Safari saved passwords.\nSo the other answer helped me figure it out. That gibberish was saved in the Keychain and not in Safari. Deleting it there fixed my problem. However, if that gibberish was saved in my keychain but was also on my iPhone then that means the keychain was being synced as well, and not just what Safari has saved. So be aware of that as well if you want to remove everything from the cloud. I also know that the keychain shares across the cloud because as soon as I've put a wifi password in on one device then my other devices will connect to that wifi automatically as well. There are several things that get shared and not just your Safari passwords.\nUPDATE (restored after being deleted): I'm sorry I couldn't just make this a comment on the other correct answer but at the time of writing I didn't have enough reputation to leave comments so I was forced to write this as an answer against my will. I hope I'm forgiven. (And please don't censor me.

I'm trying to achieve the same on a Filevault2 volume, disk0 as internal disk. I want to write this to an identically sized partition on an external USB disk.\nI made the destination partition a GUID Journaled extended HFS+ journaled to match the original volume. The dd finished but the partition is unusable, doesn't unlock, mount or boot.\nI'm thinking of reformatting the partition as DOS and writing over it with dd again. Would it be safe to hope the partition will inherit the desired scheme from the source? It takes 4 hours to write 250GB and wanted to see if anyone else had done this before.\nFilevault2 reconfigures the single partition on disk0, to add the recovery partition after 10.7 giving you something like this:\n/dev/disk0\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *250.1 GB   disk0\n1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1 \n2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         249.2 GB   disk0s2 \n3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER \n0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *248.9 GB   disk1\n\ndisk1 is the encrypted data of the core storage logical volume. This is similar to what happens in LUKS on Linux.\nSo my hope is to get this into a partition on a shared 1 TB external drive. Any thoughts on what format to make that partition would be appreciated.\n\nA: Just to rectify one thing: disk1 is not the encrypted data. Disk1 is a mounted \"virtual\" volume with its own disk identifier. This volume is unlocked and as such unencrypted if you are a legitimate user. It's based on inferior encrypted data structures residing in disk0s2.\nTo clone (and subsequently decrypt) FileVault2 volumes successfully three objects/data structures are important:\n\n\n*\n\n*Superior LVM structures in disk0s2 (the CoreStorage Volume Group)\n\n*The Recovery HD partition. It contains some intermediate keys which are necessary to extract the final keys to unlock the FileVault2 volume.\n\n*The encrypted data itself\n\n\nTo clone a FileVault2 volume you may either dd the CoreStorage LVG and the Recovery HD or copy the unlocked FileVault2 volume to a second volume with rsync or Disk Utility/a disk cloner like Carbon Copy Cloner.\ndd:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal and enter diskutil list.\n\n*Enter sudo gpt -r -vv show /dev/diskX with diskX: the disk with the CoreStorage LVG containing the FileVault2 Logical Family/Volume\n\n*Now attach a second (external) disk (diskY) and replicate the GUID partition table of the source (diskX) to the target disk (size, type etc.) with gpt.\n\n*Recheck the identity of the GUID partition table of diskX and diskY\n\n*Enter:\ndd if=/dev/rdiskXs1 of=/dev/rdiskYs1 to copy the EFI partition\ndd if=/dev/rdiskXs2 of=/dev/rdiskYs2 to copy the CoreStorage LVG\ndd if=/dev/rdiskXs3 of=/dev/rdiskYs3 to copy the Recovery HD\n\n*done\n\n\nDisk Cloner\nThis will not create an identical disk (same intermediate/final keys etc.) but a volume containing identical data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to a Recovery HD, an installer thumb drive or a second full-blown OS X volume.\n\n*Enter the unlock key of the FileVault2 volume while booting.\n\n*Attach the external disk and create a sufficiently dimensioned normal volume with an appropriate tool.\n\n*Open Disk Utility (or Carbon Copy Cloner if use a full OS X system)\n\n*Restore the source volume (the unlocked FileVault2 volume) to the destination disk.\n\n*Reboot to the external drive.\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Security and enable FileVault.\n\n", "Q: Downloads stack progress bar \"stuck\" at 100% after completion of downloads \nAs you can see, the downloads stack's progress indicator is at 100%, and is permanently stuck there even after the completion of all downloads.

Is there a way I cam download the upgrade of smaller size or do I have to get new installation in any case, and then how should I have a resumable download?\n\nA: You seem to have two questions here…\n\nWhy is OS X Mavericks upgrade size the same as a fresh install?\n\nThere's only one installer. Unlike Windows, there's a single OS X installer that is able to install on and/or upgrade any machine capable of running Mavericks, from any prior version of OS X all the way back to 10.6.\n\nIs there a way I can download the upgrade of smaller size or do I have to get new installation in any case, and then how should I have a resumable download?\n\nNo, the OS X Mavericks install is the single installer available — there's no smaller copy.\nThe Mac App Store does support resumable download, so don't worry about your internet connection dropping. It will pause/resume the download automatically.\n\nA: Mac App Store downloads support pausing and continuing after connectivity problems.

But if I close the drop down and try to edit the end time end time directly as if I put in a later time Calendar changes it to 3 hours. However only sometimes (about 50% success)\nHow do I enter an entry longer than 3 hours?\n\nA: I use the + quick event button which is the same as Command-N to enter:\nmeeting from 10am to 5pm on thursday\n\nIt makes blocking specific times quite easy using Calendar app. I also often use the week or day view and create a default event and drag the bottom of the event to the end time.\nLastly, I select the hour when I mouse to raise the quick interval drop down and rather than use the mouse to change the end time, just type the hour and tab to the minutes field if necessary.\n\nA: One way that might work is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Event \"To\" Time.\n\n*When the drop-down menu appears, press Esc.\n\n*Double-click on the hours/minutes of the \"To\" time. It should be highlighted now (orange for me). \n\n*Then press Arrow Up.\nSlightly inconvenient but hopefully it solves the issue.\n\nA: I think I have found the issue.\nThe method which is what I tried is as per Felix Sim's and mwd27's answers.\nThe issue seems to be that there is a timer on the time field to type say 18 you have to hit the 1 and then 8 close enough together and my typing is just slow enough to sometimes hit the timeout and Calendar puts the old value back.\nGutierrezDev's answer works for me reliably as it only requires one key press.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new event\n\n*Click on the end time hours\n\n*When the drop-down menu appears type in the end time manually, e.g. \"23\"\n\n*Hit return or click outside the bubble to enter the new event\n\n\nThis worked for me successfully on Calendar 7.0 (1835.1).\n\nA: This answer doesn't so much attempt to provide a complete answer, but rather an explanation of what's (probably) going on and why some of the others' answers are good workarounds.\nThe quick explanation is that this appears to be a poor logic/design decision for instant enforcement of data integrity rules at the expense of natural, easy data entry. In short, if you need to change the \"to\" time from AM to PM (or vice versa), you likely need to make the change to AM/PM first, then change the hour & minute (which could easily explain why you may only see it about 50% of the time).\nWorkaround Roundup\n\n\n*\n\n*As bmike suggests, using Cmd+N for quick event entry is perhaps the easiest solution, or at least the most consistently easiest. (You never even  have to think about whether you'll have to change AM/PM).\n\n*Felix_Sim's solution of using the arrow keys to change the hour also works, because that will automatically change AM/PM as the hour changes from 11 to 12. This should work well, though could easily be less efficient with numerous events with durations of several hours.\n\n*If you don't mind switching to 24-Hour Time (System Preferences > Language and Region), then mwd27's solution will work, because there is no AM/PM switch to get in the way.\n\n*Finally, you could also make sure you change AM/PM first, then go back to the hour. It's not elegant, but it will work.\nI would also strongly recommend sending feedback to Apple requesting time not be validated until after it has been completely entered, rather than while it is actively being entered.\nExplanation, Observations & History\nThe problem appears to occur in Mountain Lion and Mavericks under these conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The automatically entered \"to\" and \"from\" times are both \"AM\" or both \"PM\", and\n\n*The user attempts to change the \"to\" time to a time that will require: \n\n*\n\n*toggling AM/PM, and \n\n*the new hour is a number less than the hour in the \"from\" time, and \n\n*the hour is entered before AM/PM is changed.\n\n\n\nThe problem appears to be the result of how Calendar ensures that the \"to\" time is later than the \"from\" time (to avoid a negative duration). \nIn Lion and earlier, Calendar (or iCal, at that time) would check that the \"to\" time was later than \"from\" after the user finished entering all date & time fields (it was actually a single field with multiple parts in that version, rather than separate fields). If an earlier time was entered, it would revert to the previous valid time. In Mountain Lion and Mavericks, Calendar makes this check as each individual field is being entered, making it impossible to change the hour in \"to\" to a smaller number than \"from\" until AM/PM is changed.\nExample: Say you have an event, \"from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM\" and want to change it to \"from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM\". The expected way to enter the \"to\" time is to enter \"3\" for the hour, then change \"AM\" to \"PM\". Here's what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion: The user can type \"3\" in the \"to\" hour then change \"AM\" to \"PM\" then exit the date & time field.\n\n*ML & Mavericks: The user can type \"3\" in the \"to\" hour, but, because \"AM\" hasn\"t been changed yet, the resulting \"to\" time would be 3:00 AM, which is not valid because that\"s before 9:00 AM, so it is rounded to the nearest possible valid time (rather than reverting to the last valid time that was entered), which is 9:00 AM.\n\n\nA: After you put the end time from the list (3 hours Max) then use Arrow up to add more hours.\n", "Q: How do I get out of iPhone's Safe Mode (jailbroken)?

OSx also running very slowly now. Something happend after that restart on updates and mavericks is booting very slowly and also running slowly...\n\nA: Since the problem followed the hard drive when connected to a new computer, you have a clear case where the problem is disk based. The slowness, the error, and that it seems to be getting worse would make me think that you may only have a short amount of time to finish your recovery efforts.\nWorst case, the drive itself is failing and you can only get files off while it cooperates. Best case, the file system is corrupt and once you zero the drive entirely, it will work properly. The test that determines which of the two is the case involves erasing the entire drive, so plan for the worst and hope for the best. \n\n\n*\n\n*Consider stopping your recovery attempts if the data is of value such that you would pay a professional. If it is hardware, time may run out and running the drive could make things worse. \n\n*Prioritize and get the most important files off that drive entirely considering both the Mac side and the Windows side. \n\n*Use PC file recovery tools on the Boot Camp side, use Mac recovery tools like Data Rescue 3 on the Mac side. Also, don't overlook tools like rsync that can ignore errors and keep trying to copy other files after running into the initial error - 36. \n\n\nGood luck. It seems like you have a good handle on various options for getting files off the drive so I wanted to offer some other options. Also, you made no mention of backups whatsoever - depending on how recent your last windows backup and last Mac backup are, you could reduce the scope of your efforts accordingly.\n", "Q: Time Entry on IPhone How can I enter times on an iPhone directly so that I do not have to go through the scrolling rotating standard time widget.\nIt is much quicker and easier to type 1545 rather than scroll from now until that time and fiddle about when you overshoot.

If there's nothing listed you could also check the complete process list on the CPU tab.\nIf your MacBook has two graphics cards, the one with higher energy consumption might be currently running. This tool can show which card is in use: http://gfx.io/. Using the second graphics card decreases battery life a lot.\n\nA: Hmm. What you should check is, go to system information, and go to power. Put a screenshot here.\nIt should include cycles, charge capacity, etc.\nPut it here so we can see what's going on.\n", "Q: Mac mini loses wifi when an ubuntu computer is on the same network Someone gave me their mac mini running osx 10.6.\nI have a D-Link router at home.  I want to connect my mac mini to the home network.\nI start by turning off all other computers and wifi devices i have at home so that i make sure nothing else is on the wifi network.\nI turn on my mac mini, and it automatically detects my home network.  I select the network and enter a password that has wpa2 encryption. Mac mini successfully connects and i can surf the web, watch youtube videos, use skype etc...\nI then go to another room and turn on my Dell laptop.  It also successfully connects to the home network and can surf the web.  But now all of a sudden, my mac mini loses wifi connection because no matter what url i put into safari, it says can not connect to \"domain name\".  I can't even use safari to open up 192.168.0.1 which should show my router user interface.\nI then close the lid on my laptop.  Now all of a sudden my mac mini has internet connection again.  I open the laptop lid, the mac mini loses internet connection.\nHow do i fix this i problem?\nADDITIONAL NOTES\nI just noticed my mac mini loses connection ONLY IF MY LINUX laptop jumps on the same wifi network.  In otherwords, if i boot my laptop into windows instead, my mac mini remains on the wifi network. If I boot my laptop into ubuntu linux, then it kicks my mac mini off the wifi network.  I have other cmoputers and phones connected to the wifi network and it doesn't affect the mac mini wifi.\nSo it's only my dell laptop when in Ubuntu Linux that kicks my mac mini off of wifi.\nMy linux laptop is at IP address 192.168.0.102.  My mac mini is on IP address 192.168.0.110.  So there's no conflict with IP ...\nDoes anyone know how to correct this problem?\n\nA: Try locking down the MAC address into the router to a specific IP address.\nMAC address is media access controller not the mac mini.\nThe router will dhcp the same IP each time you connect.\n", "Q: Simple audio recording software There are lot of questions regarding audio recording software on this forum, but I didn't find what I need. I am practicing speaking a foreign language, and I want to hear  how I speak. I do not want to save my recordings. Basically I want an application with  a record button and play button, such that as soon as I press record the previous recording gets erased and a new one starts. Quick Time works great, but it always offers to save an untitled file which is very annoying, and I don't find an option to turn that off.  \n\nA: Audacity\n\nAudacity® is free, open source, cross-platform software for recording and editing sounds.\n\nYou can click record, record the sound, stop and playback, then start again by clicking record. You can play only the latest recording by choosing to 'solo' the last selected track (which is the last track that you recorded to).\n", "Q: Numbers: conditonal highlight based on a date in a different column In numbers, I would like to change the background colour of Column D based on whether the date in Column A is still in the future  (i.e. graying out).\nI can get the colour formatting to work on the date column itself ('Date is after the date 0 days ago'), but how can I specify that the rule is based on a different column?\nIf I specify the above colour rule in 'D' (a pure numeric column), then the colour doesn't change as D doesn't contain a date...\n\nA: This currently isn't possible. Conditional highlighting will only run the condition on the cell that the rule has been applied to.\n\nTo change the appearance of a cell based on its cell value, create a conditional highlighting rule.\n\nSource: Add conditional highlighting to cells — Numbers Help for Mac; emphasis mine.\nThe only exception to this is for conditions where a comparison is required — a second value can be referenced in the rule.\n\nClick  to use a cell reference. A cell reference lets you compare the cell’s value to another cell—so, for example, you can highlight a cell when its value is greater than another cell’s. Click a cell to select it, or enter its table address (for example, F1).\n\nSource: Add conditional highlighting to cells — Numbers Help for Mac.\nAs a workaround, you could duplicate (or reference) the column A and place it next to column D, applying the conditional highlighting to that column instead. It won't be highlighting the cell with the data, but it'll give you something to glance at next to the data.\n", "Q: Best lightweight browser for OS X 10.4.11 iBook G4 I have an iBook G4 running OS X 10.4.11 and I really would like to watch youtube videos, but it is very choppy and generally impossible to watch!\nI've read over this thread: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=768766 and it suggests changing the power to Best Performance, turning off hardware acceleration, and upping the Flash cache size to 10MB, all of which I have done. I'm also downloading the iBook optimized Firefox 4.0 to try that out (though that seems a little outdated, seeing as the newest version is about 20 versions newer.)\nStrangely enough, my system can play DVDs at full-screen with no problem whatsoever.\nDoes anyone know of any good, lightweight, web browsers (or alternatively, a way that I can get Youtube working within TenFourFox 24?)\nThanks!\nEDIT:\nJust a heads up, I was able to get 240p playing fine in OmniWeb. Version 5 I believe. It had occasional lag, but generally it was good. My internet isn't good enough to play anything about 360p, so I don't go above that, but I really would like to be able to use 360p instead of 240p, if possible. I think it's the quality of the video that is causing the lag, even though DVDs play at very good quality.\nI also tried using the optimized version for iBook G4, but it said that it couldn't run on my system...annoying.\n\nA: TenFourFox\nA rewritten version of Firefox compiled to run great on older hardware.\n\n\nWe take the industry standard Mozilla Firefox browser and rewrite it to be compatible with Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, then compile it specially optimized for your G3, G4 or G5, add AltiVecTM JPEG, HTML and WebM decoding acceleration for G4 and G5 Macintoshes, and soup up JavaScript performance with our best-in-class just-in-time PowerPC script compiler. One of our four versions is just right for your particular Power Mac.

I had to use the Quicktime part of the app, but I have it working! No browser required!\nHowever, if anyone knows of any good lightweight browser, please still answer, as that was the original question.\nThanks!\n\nA: Tenfourfox disables all plugins so you wont be able to watch youtube on it. Tenfourfox is good for browsing and google type uses. I recommend to use safari (check that it is the lastest version posible), omniweb or opera.  \n\nA: If you use safar and have it open tabs as a developer. You can view YouTube as if it's on an iPad.

First of all, the specs:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011)\n\n*OS X 10.9.1 (Mavericks)\n\n*2.3 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*8 GB RAM\n\nThe Problem\nRecently, my battery randomly died and I had to disconnect it, otherwise, my computer would not properly turn on (MacBook Pro was restarting itself and turning off over and over again).\nNow, every time I plug-in the power cable, it starts straightaway (even without pushing the power button), turns off after a few seconds, and then starts normally. Weird.\nNevertheless, the main problem is, after some time, the laptop becomes VERY slow. By \"VERY slow\" I mean - games become unplayable (FPS drop from 60 to 6) and kernel_task starts using more than 500% of the CPU. Moreover, the mouse speed significantly increases.\nI tried the interrock's (the 10th post) guide but it does not seem to work correctly and caused me a kernel panic related to the SleepEnabler.\nP.S. I have read somewhere that Apple does this \"underclocking\" intentionally, for safety or marketing (to buy a new battery) reasons. Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\nOS X will intelligently throttle CPU based on certain\nconditions in an effort to a) prolong battery life and b) avoid system\ndamage (through excessive heat). Apple does not \"sabotage\" machines in\nan effort to get customers to buy new batteries. –  cksum\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\nSolution (That Worked For Me)\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190507215911/http://www.rdoxenham.com/?p=259\n\nA: The kernel task soaking CPU cycles is primarily a safety and longevity issue.\nThe CPU is capable of generating far more heat than the MacBook Pro frame can radiate and to control for failing fans and other hardware failures, the system is going to dramatically reduce the CPU's ability to generate heat when it senses a rapid rise in the measured temperatures - especially when the blowers are not responding as expected or already commanded to run at their maximum RPM values.\nYou will want to rule out temperature as a cause of this behavior as a first step IMO.\nAlso, consider replacing the battery as it also has temperature sensors and the firmware might be far more conservative with CPU when it knows that some sensors are no longer reporting for duty, so to speak.\n\nA: Apple not only underclocks the CPU to about half, when no battery is present, but also the GPU, either with or without a battery.\nI think the reason is not to necessarily force the user to buy a new battery but remains a marketing one. Have you noticed how the MBP AC charger is considerable smaller than most AC chargers for PC laptops? I'm not an expert in watts and voltage but to account for the minimalist and elegant design they didn't make it powerful enough for your MBP to operate. It needs a battery for full power otherwise the AC adapter and your machine could get toasted or simply fail to work.\nThe GPU throttling was a measure to ensure their brand would get better battery life than the competition, otherwise you would get ~4 hours of usage, not really competitve in the laptop world.\nA workaroud for the CPU issue, besides the one you posted, consists in undervolting, which is offered by a shareware app called CoolBook. Unfortunately, it is only supported up to Snow Leopard and has a very strict license policy (per computer, not per user).\nThe safest option is still to get a new battery.\nA workaround for the GPU issue is posted here.\n\nA: I think your main issue and you battery are related in a Domino sense. I can't tell from your post but you did say that you unplugged the battery. Doing so reset your SMC that's why now every time you attach a power cord the unit jumps on and has a mild heart attack, restarts and finally boots.\nYou SMC has been damaged and needs to be reset and for that look to http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964\nNow regarding your CPU% I agree with cksum and bmike. Your battery does have sensors in it and if your battery is missing or damaged then you should get it replaced because the fans and unit will freak out under stress or time. Additionally I would also suggest running Apple Hardware Test which should be on one of your systems grey DVDs that shipped with the unit. Running AHT tests the sensors quickly and does CPU and RAM checks which is something handy in this case. I don't want to think there was any reason ESD damage could happen but it is a risk and possibility.\n\nA: rdoxenham's method does fix the kernel_task issue, but it doesn't bring the cpu's performance back to its actual mode. Let me give you my story's background.\nI have a MBP 15'Inch Early 2011(i7, 10GB RAM), So its been a while that it's battery died & I did face the GPU & CPU lag until rdoxenham's fix.\nThis process is a temporarily fix until we replace our dead/old/faulty battery. Without the battery in the laptop the CPU isn't taking in enough power that it needs to run at its optimum level. \nIf you use GeekBench for testing your laptop's performance you will notice the difference in your laptop's score & others out their without this issue.\nMy score seemed affected by the cpu not getting the power it needed without the battery in. This Fix solves the software part of the issue but doesn't solve the hardware part. \nOur CPU's need their juice and i would say This FIX is a GREAT fix for them, who's just facing the kernel issue with a working condition battery. But for someone like me(running a macbook without a battery) this doesn't solve everything. GET A BATTERY ASAP. AMAZON it!\n\nA: It does seem like you have a problem with your battery, although it's likely that it's only adding to the underlying issue which you've touched upon. \nThe concept behind Speedstep seems good, however, the way in which it works is quite bad — especially when it comes to kernel_task. I believe it's the reason you're seeing such a dramatic slowdown — because this \"feature\" is consuming the majority of your MacBook Pro CPU so it can apparently cool your system down and save energy. \n\nIntel SpeedStep Technology allows the system to dynamically adjust processor voltage and core frequency, which can result in decreased average power consumption and decreased average heat production. (from Intel)\n\nWhat this equates to is you end up losing a significant portion of the CPU while SpeedStep hijacks kernel_task and continually carries out low-overhead tasks until the CPU temperature drops. Your system essentially becomes bogged down so you can save energy regardless if you want to or not. I would imagine that most people expect to be able to use all of their CPU power when they want to — not when their system allows them. \nLuckily this “feature” is built into a kext, in which each model identifier specifies how to control the temperature of the CPU. It's a simple fix, and most people that have similar issues to what you describe are quite happy once they realize this. I take no credit for this fix, for it's all thanks to Rhys Oxenhams who researched this and came up with a solution. \n\nA: rdoxenham's metod worked for me too. This was my issue: \nMacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011), macOS 10.12.1 Sierra. The battery had been dead since a while back but the computer had worked fine. One day it suddenly wouldn't wake up from sleep and the power button didn't react. I pulled out and put back the power cord and could then boot again. Booting now took many minutes and everything lagged. Mouse moved in something like 0.5 fps. Everything worked but there was extreme lag. Animations, the cursor, keyboard input, the time required for opening applications – everything. Activity monitor reported the system using close to 100 % of the CPU almost always. Sometimes it went down a bit and the lag got a bit better. For short moments CPU activity was normal and then everything worked fine, but the problems returned after a minute. kernel_task was reported as using much more CPU than what was available – between 200-1000 %. The problem remained despite reboots and letting the computer stay on overnight. The computer was unusable.\nI ruled out bad software and many potential sources of bad hardware. I tried all of this, but the problem remained:\n\n\n*\n\n*Took out the HDD and booted from it externally\n\n*Booted from another HDD externally, running OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. \n\n*Disconnected the internal HDD SATA cable\n\n*Different power adapter\n\n*PRAM reset\n\n*SMC reset\n\n*Reseated both RAM modules\n\n*Used only one of the RAM modules at a time, in different slots, to rule out any one of the modules or slots being bad\n\n*Disconnected the battery\n\n*Disconnected the AirPort/Bluetooth cable\n\n*Disconnected the trackpad\n\n\nI suspected a logic board issue. But I then tried moving out the appropriate kext file from /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext/Contents/Resources/. Like magic, the computer now seems to work fine again. I'll see if I can get a hold on a replacement battery and put back the kext, but for now this will do. I don't get how removing a kext could result in overheating. A kext is part of a specific installation of the OS and would for example not be present when booting into Windows or something else. Surely the temperature must primarily be controlled by something lower level. But well, if the computer dies, it dies. It didn't work before this fix anyway. \n", "Q: I got the new iPad Air for Christmas. Everything transferred seamlessly but one app. What now? It was the game Tribez. The information was last backed up on my old iPad 2 11/18/13. I don't understand how all of my other apps were brought over perfectly, but this one. I have contacted their customer service and they said to do another back up on the old one, then restore my new one again. That would mean I need to do a backup of the new first. Do the backups cancel each other out? Keeping only one?\n\nA: You can backup data from apps with a program such as PhoneView (Mac) or iFunBox (Mac & Windows).\n\nBrowse, manage and download most any data saved by App Store apps from your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. If you're looking for a quick way to download saved recordings, videos or images from your apps, this is it. Even transfer game high scores between devices. --PhoneView\n\nOnce you have the app data, it can be restored to a new copy of the app downloaded from the App Store.\n", "Q: Enable \"On My Mac\" Contacts I am currently running OS X 10.9.1 and would like to create contacts that are stored locally on my MacBook Pro. My Contacts app does not have \"On My Mac\" as an option in the sidebar; only the contacts I have synced with my work's Exchange. Additionally, there is no discernible way to make the \"On My Mac\" account the default. I attempted to go to \"Contacts > Preferences > General\" but there is no option to choose the default account. However, if I add my GMail account then I can set the default but \"On My Mac\" is not an option.\nAll I want to do is create a contact that is stored only on my local machine and not synced with any cloud based service.\nHow do I enable the \"On My Mac\" contact group on OS X Mavericks?\n\nA: bmike's work around did not quite do it for me as, as soon as I re-enabled iCloud everything was merged back into one bunch of iCloud contacts again.\nWhat did work for me is very similar though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select one or more of your contacts from the iCLouds group and drag them to your desktop creating one vCard.\n\n*In Preference > Accounts > iCloud uncheck the \"Enable this Account\". \"On My Mac\" appears immediately in the Group pane.\n\n*Drag the vCard from your desktop over the empty contact space, your contacts will be imported in \"On My Mac\".\n\n*In Preference > Accounts > iCloud check the \"Enable this Account\". iCloud will reappear as Group.\n\n\nYou now have two sets of contacts, one \"On My Mac\" and one \"All iCloud\". If you started out by dragging all contacts in the iCloud group to your desktop the two sets will be completely identical. Does it make sense to do that? Well, you'll always have your contacts available also in the event that your network is down. Furthermore it is a way of making a back-up of your iCloud contacts alternative to what is proposed on:\nArchive or make copies of your iCloud data:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4910?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nEdit August 25\nIn addition to my answer fo August 20 I stumbled over perhaps an even better way of making an exact copy of your contacts from iCloud to your Mac. Once you have re-enabled iCloud you can select all contacts in \"All iCloud\" and just drag them in your \"All on my Mac\" group, so without using the back up you made earlier to your desktop. The nice thing is that your contacts birthdays won't show up twice in your Mac Calendar as they do when copied via Desktop first. Any contacts you add or delete via iCloud won't show up on or disappear from your On My Mac version. Editing of the content in iCloud appears to affect the On my Mac content as well when it is done in the Mac Contact app, not if it is done in iCloud on any other device. Anyway, the Contact App on your Mac distinguishes nicely the differences between the two. Just try it out by typing something in the Note field in either Group in Mac Contact or in your web based iCloud.\n\nA: How about this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your computer if you have any doubts that this will work\n\n*Export one contact from the app by selecting it and dragging it to the desktop\n\n*Quit the contacts app\n\n*Then disable all cloud based contact sources\n\n*Open the contact card on your desktop and add it to your contacts\n\n\nYou now have a local store of contacts. Add back the cloud accounts one by one and optionally move some of the contacts to the local store. Also, you will want to set your default account in the Contacts app preferences to your preferred store.\n\nA: Restore \"on my mac\" contacts.\nI lost all my \"on my mac\" and other contacts while trying different settings to solve a sync problem. Restore with back up got my contacts back but not the \"on my mac\" no matter what I tried. (I am a seamstress not a computer expert)\nToday I have been able to set up \"on my mac\" contacts again thanks to the question and answers above!\nI noticed by turning off iCloud contacts (system preference->iCloud-> un tick contacts) and going back to contacts, my contacts in iCloud would disappear and on \"my my mac\" would appear.\nTurning iCloud back on iCloud contacts all appeared again but \"on my mac\" disappeared.\nHow I restored \"on my mac\" contacts:\n\n\n*\n\n*with iCloud contacts on, open contacts.\n\n*Drag one contact on to desk top.\n\n*Turn off iCloud contacts (system preference->iCloud-> un tick contacts)\n\n*Drag the contact icon from desktop and drop on to \"on my mac\" in contacts.\n\n*Turn on iCloud contacts (system preference->iCloud-> tick contacts)\n\n\nBack to contacts, all iCloud contacts AND \"on my mac\" containing the one contact were there! Result! I could drag groups rather than single contact on to \"on my mac\". It copied so contacts were still in iCloud as well.\nHope this helps and works for you too :) Happy!\n", "Q: Wake for network access without Bonjour Sleep Proxy? Is there a way to set some kind of \"wake for network access\" behaviour on my Mac without using a Bonjour Sleep Proxy?\nI have a Mac with OS X 10.8.5, but no Apple TV nor Time Capsule or other stuff. I am happy with Unix solutions that require a bit of install and tuning on my laptops.\n\nA: Wake on Lan works great on Macs with the following configuration : \n\n\n*\n\n*Connected using an Ethernet cable. \n\n*Port forwarding if you're behind a NAT Router. \n\n*Enable wake on network access\n\n*A sleepy Mac (not Shutdown, it has to be on sleep)\n\n\nThat's it ! \n", "Q: iMac behaves inconsistently when waking from long periods of inactivity I have a late 2012 model iMac with OS X Mavericks installed. When I go to wake the iMac after a long period of inactivity (2 days for example) it behaves in one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes the iMac wakes immediately, meaning the desktop shows up right away and all applications are snappy and ready to go.\n\n*Other times after waking, the desktop view is grayed out with a status bar at the bottom of the screen which takes a couple seconds to complete before un-graying the desktop. After the desktop is un-grayed, applications and other user-interactions are slow to respond, as if the computer is still \"warming-up\".\n\n\nMy Energy Saver preferences are set to put the display to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity, then the computer to sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity.\nWhy this inconsistency in waking?\n\nA: This would be explained if your iMac was sometimes in what Apple calls Safe Sleep and others (and Apple internally) call hibernation mode and is expected and intended by Apple to save energy.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1757\n\nYou should be able to disable this if needed by using pmset on the command line. Unless you are comfortable with the terminal, you might just leave things as Apple has configured since the hibernation should only engage for longer sleep periods to save more energy than if the machine was kept sleeping lightly the entire time.\n", "Q: Does Mac Pro 5,1 support USB 3?

I use iTunes Match. I recently updated a bunch of meta data in iTunes on my PC. These updates have been pushed to iCloud and thence to iTunes on my other PCs. However, the iOS devices still have the old meta data after a couple of days.\nI've tried killing the music app and rebooting the phone, to no avail. I'm looking for a little reload button (like at the top of the contacts list when contacts are synced with Google), but I'm not finding anything.\nI haven't yet tried disabling iTunes Match and reenabling it. I fear that I will lose my downloaded songs, and that I'll have to rethink which ones to download and which not to.\n\nA: I turned off iTunes Match on my phone. All the Match songs that were downloaded were still available (cool!) and the non-downloaded ones were no longer listed. I then killed the Music app and rebooted the phone. Same thing. I then turned iTunes Match back on. It re downloaded all the metadata, but reattached to all my downloaded songs. It didn't need to re download them.\nPretty awesome.\n", "Q: How can I undo \"always allow\" in keychain item By mistake, I clicked on \"always allow\" on a file in my keychain on the Mac.

I'm using OS X Mavericks and just got a new external hard disk. I don't need to share it with a PC (so no need for FAT) but I do want it to have better I/O performance.\nI'm a bit confused by the options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Journaled\n\n*Journaled, Encrypted\n\n*Case sensitive, Journaled\n\n*Case sensitive, Journaled, Encrypted\n\n\nWhich one should I use? Thanks.\n\nA: None of the HFS flavors will offer any performance benefit that's measurable. For that reason, go with the default format disk utility gives you and look to optimize elsewhere. \nI have seen encryption slow down some storage medium such as slow USB flash and I would expect journaling there to also be more of a slowdown than on storage with fast cache or more responsive write service times.\nI suppose journaling could in some rare circumstances (bizarre edge cases) slow things down as you need to journal certain actions, take the action, and then journal that the action is complete. However, the journaling is for rare events like file creation, file deletion, etc... - some metadata operations are journaled, not all data writes like other filesystems allow which can cause a large performance impact. \nJournaling does make it easy to roll the filesystem back to a known state if the system crashes or the drive gets disconnected without changes flushed, so you can save hundreds of seconds to several minutes at the next reboot / mount by journaling.\nFor best performance, keep the drive approximately 70% full at most as portions of the disk are much slower for random access and the OS uses the fast part of the drive first.\nSo, in order of fastest to slowest speed transfer:\nConnection type: Thunderbolt2 > Thunderbolt > Fiber Channel > SAS > USB 3.0 > FW 800/400 > USB 2.0\nStorage Medium: Specialized SLC/MLC Flash with high speed controllers > PCI Prosumer SSD > 15k HDD > Consumer SSD > 10k/7.5k HDD > Fast Small FLASH > 5k HDD > Consumer USB flash storage\n\nA: Journaled for certain. I'd use the encryption option for security sake, but I don't know what the I/O performance trade off is with this setting. That is all.\nFor better I/O performance from external disks, purchase a RAID. I use 2 Guardian Maximus RAID boxes from OWC which provides a mirrored (redundant disk) RAID1, but they also sell other RAID boxes with faster I/O.\nFor true I/O performance, nothing beats SSD, though.\n", "Q: What is preventing my Macbook Pro 2012 from going to sleep? the other day i open my MacBook Pro mid 2012 for upgrading my ram, everything was ok, but when i closed it i notice that when i close the lid nothing happens.

There's also something not quite right about it that I can't put my finger on.\nThere are tons of adapters that plug into the docking port and expose a line out connection, which should be better than the headphone output. There are a couple of problems with these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most don't allow you to charge the iPod while the adapter is plugged in.\n\n*None have a built in line level amplifier.

Simply use an adapter like the FiiO L11 (or another cheap 30-Pin > Line-Out + USB-Power-In) an you´ll be amazed: The sound will be way louder and way, way better than the one from the headphone-out. Trust me, I made an A/B-comparison with A=adapter and B=Headphone-Out, both connected to the Line-Ins of an DJ-Mixer and hardly could believe, how much better the sound was!\nCheers from Germany!\n\nA: Most headphone amps have very little amplification.

Download the app from Google called \"Apple TV Remote.\"  When downloaded, make sure the Apple TV and your Galaxy are connected to the same wireless.  When you open the app, your screen will look just like a gigantic silver Apple TV remote.  Just push it normally and your Apple TV will IMMEDIATELY RESPOND.   No pairing.  No home-sharing nonsense.  No need for an ethernet to connect AppleTV to your computer.\nJust download and click.  Done.\n", "Q: Loss of audio on MacBook Retina 15\" 2013 I have a laptop that's two weeks old. I plugged in my headphones for the first time today, and I had no audio, so I unplugged them and I still had no audio.\nI have done the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart\n\n*Sleep\n\n*Shutdown\n\n*Plugged in headphones multiple times and turned\n\n*Checked for foreign objects\n\n*Reset PRAM and SMC\n\n*Restored from recovery console\n\n*Erased disc and restored new OSX from recovery console\n\n*Checked audio settings to make sure internal speaker, mute and volume and all ok.\n\n*Checked for light emitting from headphone jack\n\n*Checked that the micro switches in the jack are no depressed.\n\n\nI am looking for more suggestions. I use the laptop for work everyday, so I can't afford to give it to Apple to fix at the moment.\n\nA: It was a faulty logic board. Had it replaced under warranty and issue resolved.\n", "Q: Automate daily saving of webarchive? Is it possible to automate the saving of a webpage (using the .webarchive format) using either Automator (in a background process) or using Terminal?\n\nA: Downloading & saving as webarchive\nA command line tool named webarchiver will download URLs and save them to .webarchive format. You can install this tool via MacPorts (alas, not homebrew!) or compile it with XCode. I am a XCode dummy, but succeeded with instructions found here.\nHow to operate:\nwebarchiver 0.5\nUsage: webarchiver -url URL -output FILE \nExample: webarchiver -url http://www.google.com -output google.webarchive\n-url    http:// or path to local file\n-output File to write webarchive to\n\nNice file names\nThis lenghty one-liner for terminal allows you to configure the desired URL and will download a YYYY-MM-DD-prefixed webarchive file:\nURL=\"www.nytimes.com\"; ./webarchiver -url \"http://$URL\" -output \"/Users/<your username>/Desktop/$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d-$URL.webarchive\")\"\nThis will save a webarchive to your Desktop:\n2014-02-10-www.nytimes.com.webarchive\nIf you are not sure what <your username> is, enter whoami in Terminal.app (and press enter, of course).\nCron\nI would rather use launchd, as \"the use of cron on OS X is discouraged\". There is a nice launchd editor named Lingon. Have fun!\n\nA: Yes is the simple answer with either. \nI am on my iPad at the mo. But you can use unix command curl to download the webpage to and pipe it to the unix command textutil which can output it to a webarchive file.\nIf I get a chance I will post an example.\n\nHere is a small example (quick ) of what I was thinking. Written in Applescript running do shell script commands.\n  property agent : \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3\"\n\nproperty outPutFormat : \"rtf\"\nproperty saveDIR : \"/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/\"\nproperty fileName : \"test2\"\n\nset theData to do shell script \"curl \" & \" -A\" & space & quoted form of agent & space & \"http://weather.yahoo.com/france/auvergne/france-29332634/\" as string\n\n\ndo shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of theData & \"|textutil -format html -convert\" & space & outPutFormat & space & \"-stdin -output \" & space & saveDIR & fileName & \".\" & outPutFormat\n\nAlthough this works. I am not very happy with the results. This is due to curl and textutil only processing the html code but not resources.\nSo am working on something else that will save a webArchive in a much better way. 90% there but will take a little longer for me to write\n", "Q: What is the relationship between `launchctl limit` and `ulimit`? There is not any ulimit configuration in system startup files/ shell startup scripts.\nulimit -a shows:\n-u: processes                       1064\n-n: file descriptors                256\n\nlaunchctl limit shows:\nmaxproc     2048           2048           \nmaxfiles    2048           2048\n\nI vaguely remember that launchctl's limits should match with a shell's ulimit output, I might be wrong.\nIs there any relationship between the lauchctl's limits and ulimit?\n\nA: In the shell, ulimit provides \"control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it\" (see man bash). Therefore, it applies only to the shell and its children. The limits for launchd are related to it and the processes that it manages. The two are separate.\nIndividual programs can set their own resource limits by calling the Standard C Library routines ulimit() or getrlimit() and setrlimit(). Certain resource limits cannot be elevated unless the process is running as the super-user.\nAs a practical example, I debug large software projects and the shell's default limit for the number of open files isn't big enough. In my .bashrc file, I have the following:\n# Increase the upper limit on the number of open files:\nulimit -n 1024\n\nNow my debugger won't complain that it can't open all the files it needs. Obviously, this should have no impact on launchd.\n", "Q: The iPhone is synced with another iTunes library error Message Whenever I select to manually manage music and videos, I get an error message that says \"The iPhone is synced with another iTunes library. Do you want to erase this iPhone and sync with this iTunes library?\" \nI haven't connected my iPhone to any other computer, the one I am using now is the original it was connected to (Windows PC), why is this message appearing? The only reason I can think of that it thinks it is a new iTunes library is that I updated to iTunes 11 recently. Is there anything I can do to fix this without erasing my iPhone?\n\nA: The fact is you are switching to manual syncing, thus everything will be removed and synced back on your device. You don't have to worry if everything is in your iTunes library.\nOr you could leave it to the automatic version of sync and you don't get a warning like this.\n", "Q: Difference between 'Home sharing' and 'Network sharing' When I like to share my iTunes library, I have to options to do so.\n\n\n*\n\n*Home sharing via my Apple ID\n\n*Network sharing.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between these to? Are there any advantages or disadvantages or missing features comparing these two methods?\n\nA: While both options offer the possibility of streaming the content of up to five iTunes libraries through a home network, it's only through Home Sharing when you are able to actually import the content into your own iTunes Library. \nEven more, when you use a computer on your Home Sharing network to download an item from the iTunes Store, you can have the item download automatically to other computers on your Home Sharing network.\nOther big difference is that Home Sharing lets you stream content from your iTunes library into your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV (2nd and 3rd generation), whilst Network sharing don't.\n", "Q: How do I make an ISO image out of a folder using Toast? I've seen guides on how to do it using Disk Utility and the hdutil command but when I search the net for something that involves using toast, I came up blank.\nI've looked around toast (version 11) and I don't see a way of doing it.\nCan you help? Thanks\n\nA: Toast has never used .iso format, it uses its own proprietary .toast format.\nYou can convert back to .dmg or .iso from .toast using something like DiskImageMounter but not the other way round.\n", "Q: Unwanted transformation of Chinese characters When I copy and paste character  it's transformed into the Japanese version, 禮 (radical 示 instead of 礻).\nWhat's going on? Is this some 'feature' of Unicode? Is there still a way to paste the character  to a text document / Notes.app note? (After all, on the Wikipedia page linked above the character displays correctly — and as a character, not as an image.)\n(Doesn't seem to depend on browser / text editor I'm using. OS X 10.9, if this is important.)\n\nA: Han characters are unified in Unicode.  Display of the Chinese vs Japanese version depends on the font.  In OS X, the default font should normally be determined by the order of these two languages in the system preferences language list.  Make sure that Chinese is higher than Japanese on your list and restart.\nIt's possible some apps might not follow that and need font adjustment individually.\n", "Q: CA storage for cURL on Mavericks I was troubleshooting a problem with Arcanist and Phabricator on MacOSX, a cURL/60 error, but it wasn't clear how to check where the php curl libraries were getting their Certificate Authority trust from.  \nWhere or how does Mavericks handle trust storage for Certificate Authorities and self-signed certificates for cURL and/or the curl libraries?  Is there a source of documentation on this which I'm missing?\nNb, I'm pretty new with MacOS.\n\nA: For documentation: If you want to read any of the Unix library instructions, you can open the Terminal application. Type \"man curl\" and you will get the manual for the curl function. There is an app called \"iMan\" which does a nice job of showing manual pages in a more readable format, and can search for manuals or show variations of similar libraries (https://sourceforge.net/projects/iman-macosx).\n\nA: cURL no longer bundles ANY CA certs; so it rejects all SSL certificates as unverifiable.\nYou'll need to obtain your CA's cert in order for things to work as they should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the cURL cacert.pem file and save it to your server\n\n*update php.ini — add curl.cainfo = \"PATH_TO/cacert.pem\"\n\n*Or add the following and/or similar to your cURL options for each instance:\n\n\n\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CAINFO, \"PATH_TO/cacert.pem\");   \ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, true);\n\n\nMore information here\n\nA: I did some experimenting with the \"Keychain Access\" utility http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_(Apple)#Keychain_Access .  It seems that cURL uses the same trust store as Safari, and it is configured there.\nI can trust a cert in Safari and it will be trusted in cURL.  I can then tell the system not to trust the cert in the Keychain Access utility and cURL will no longer trust it.\nNot sure where this is documented, but it works perfectly.\n\nI guess I'll be doing more reading on how Mavericks works.\n\nA: The documentation you are looking for is here. It explains how to use cURL on Mavericks and how to supply your certificates:\nhttp://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2013-10/0036.html\n", "Q: Enabling Things iPhone legacy sync messes up recurring tasks and areas - can this be avoided? I'm trying to enable Bonjour Legacy Sync in Things iPhone (so that I can sync with an old and unused version of Things Mac on Snow Leopard).\nHaving followed the instructions linked above, when I restart Things in Things 1 mode it shows lots of instances of a recurring task in Today which weren't there before, and doesn't show a large number of changes I've recently made to Areas.\nI've now turned off Things 1 mode and restored the Things 2 database. Is there a way to enable legacy sync without disordering my tasks and losing some recent changes?\nRunning Things 2.2.3 on iOS 6.1.1 (deliberate non-upgrade to avoid battery problems on a beaten up 4S).\n\nA: Prompt response via email from Julia at Cultured Code to my support request using the feedback form answers the question:\n\nWhen you revert to Things 1 mode, the data from Things 2 cannot be\n  converted to the older database format. There should be a note warning\n  about this when converting to Things 1 mode; if not, I apologize for\n  the confusion this caused.\nBasically, if you want to have the to-dos from Things 2 in Things 1,\n  you have to re-enter them manually. Since this downgrade path is one\n  that only very few customers chose to take, we didn’t spend time on\n  implementing a downgrade path for the data.\n\n", "Q: iPhone Reminders how to determine account How do I see which account my lists belongs to in the Reminders app? I'm using an iPhone with iOS 7.\n\nA: When you open the reminders app, it will either show a display of all the lists or show you the items in one list.\nIf you are in the detailed view, tap the white area at the bottom of the screen to bring up the List View.\nEach list that is synced through a cloud service has that service listed in grey to the right of the item count. Those without text are stored on the device only.\n", "Q: All contacts have disappeared from iPhone All contacts have vanished from my iPhone4. Group contacts are all that are visible, and they are Facebook contacts.\nI have tried uploading SIM contacts to phone. I have turned off the phone and back on. I have synced to my PC and no contacts visible. I have tried to connect to iCloud and error message reads cannot connect to server. Phone reflects iCloud backup not on. I do not know what else to do.\n\nA: I would start from a computer and log into iCloud.com and inspect that your account is in good order and add a contact / review what contacts are already stored in the cloud. \nAt that point, you can troubleshoot the iOS to iCloud sync in knowing that it isn't a problem with your account itself or a server side error. \n", "Q: Can I use my enterprise developer account to sign Passbooks that will be used externally? Can I use my enterprise developer account to sign Passbooks that will be used to download tickets from a public facing website?\nThe reason I ask this is because in the enterprise developer program it states that I cannot have apps in the normal app store but only sign apps that would be distributed internally.\n\nA: Yes - if the enterprise entity is the one distributing the pass to end users, then you should be fine using that certificate to sign Passbook items. Any Apple generated code signing certificate should be sufficient to fulfill the requirements. If you are concerned after reading this, a quick call to developer support might help alleviate any concerns you have.\nApple documents this at https://developer.apple.com/passbook/Getting_Started_with_Passbook.pdf and the version 1.1 of this document states:\n\nUse of Apple-issued Certificates\nAll passes need to be signed with an Apple-issued certificate to be recognized by Passbook. Passes should only be signed by the entity that will be distributing the pass under its own name, trademark, or brand, and that entity’s information should match the information on the back of the pass.\n", "Q: Do we need FUSE apps in Mavericks? I just heard from my friend that all those FUSE apps are not needed anymore in Mavericks. Is that true? I have, from the previous version of OS X: MacFUSE, FUSE for OS X, fuse-ext2, NTFS-3G. Do I still need them? If not, how to remove them completely?\n\nA: MacFUSE is no longer being developed, and there's many bugs with it in Mavericks. FUSE for OS X was the continuation of this development and still works well in Mavericks. I recommend that you uninstall MacFUSE and instead use FUSE for OS X.\nntfs-3g in Mavericks requires this install procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write in NTFS using Mavericks\nYou should know if you need FUSE — if you don't need it, there are official removal instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/FAQ#23-how-can-i-uninstall-fuse-for-os-x\n", "Q: Deleting pictures sent in a iMessage? When you send a picture via iMessage on the iPhone or computer and ask that person to delete it, is there a way to know they have?\nIf I delete the picture on my iPhone, will it be deleted on their iPhone? \n\nA: No, you won't get to know if or when they delete a sent picture. Also, the picture sent is retained on Apple's servers in that person's receive queue until their space gets cleared over time and/or volume of new messages and attachments.\nThe only way you would know they deleted it was by observation, trust or having access to their account to check. You don't get any delete receipt from the system should they comply with your request. Lastly, deleting a message on one of their devices may not even delete it on others, so you might ask them to delete a message on all their devices that can receive iMessage attachments and monitor new devices for a period of time.\n", "Q: How to create Mac OS X global hot key to open .txt file in MacVim.app at vim 'mark'? Can and how can I create Mac OS X global hot key (possibly mapped to an OS X service, like what OmniFocus and Fantastical offer to make new entries in their inbox/calendar, respectively) to open a specific .txt file in MacVim.app at a specific vim mark?\nI suspect I can use Automator/AppleScript or some such in combination with vim's \"global\" marks to accomplish this, but uncertain.\n\nA: Two possibilities are Keyboard Maestro or Alfred. Keyboard Maestro will set a global keyboard shortcut.\nI assume there is a command-line utility for MacVim like there is for BBEdit and if it can open at a specific ‘vim mark’. For example, BBEdit’s command is called bbedit and cal open a specific line number using “:xy” where “xy” is the line number. You could make a Keyboard Maestro shortcut that will open a specific file using this command\n/usr/local/bin/bbedit /path/to/filename:33\n\n\nA: This was an interesting one :) and I figured it out! \nThe solution is based on 3 steps (you could do it on 2 as well): \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a shell script that open up the desired textfile on a specific vim mark\n\n*Create a Automator workflow to run this script\n\n*Add a shortcut to the workflow \n\n\nHere we go: \n1. Shellscript to open textfile on a specific vim mark: launchlog.sh\n# $HOME/bin/launchlog.sh\n# This will open $HOME/test.txt on vim mark b\n/Applications/mvim -c \"execute 'normal! \\`b'\" $HOME/test.txt\n\n2. Create an Automator workflow\nThere are plenty tutorial around how to make Automator workflows. Stick to the one the describe it best for you.\nYou need to create a workflow that executes a shell script. There you paste the path to your script. My workflow is called openJournal.workflow\n\nAs a hint: The workflows are stored under $HOME/Library/Services\n3. Assign a shortcut to the workflow\nThis can be done under Systempreferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts. Under section Services you can assign your just created workflow a keyboard shortcut. In my example I added the Shift + Ctrl + Jas shortcut. \n\nNow you can open your specific text file on the specific vim mark (in my example the vim mark b) by hitting Shift + Ctrl + Jon your keyboard. \nAs a matter of course, this works only if you have a vim mark b set on your textfile.\nDo it in 2 steps\nYou could put the content of the shell script into the Automator workflow. \nSo you would skip the creation of the shell script itself. But this comes with the disadvantage, that you have to change the automator workflow if you want another behaviour. I myself like the flexibilty to just change the shell script and have the desired behaviour. \nHope that helps. \n", "Q: Internet Sharing not working with my BeagleBone Black Running Mavericks on a 15\" MBP.

Now I cannot add any contacts at all and all my old contacts were lost, too I was trying to restore my iPhone 5 because I was running out of space and the other category was taking up too much space, so I decided to restore it. However, I don't know what glitch happened during the restore, I could not restore my phone using any of the old backups so I had to restore it as a new iPhone.\nI got most of my data back on my phone after doing this, except for some apps, but I had most of my other stuff still on there so I was okay with this restore. However, all of my contacts disappeared! I had made a backup of all my contacts as a .vcf, so I had figured out a way to get them back on my phone but my problem is that the + sign that should appear on the Contacts app to add new contacts is missing. Thus, I can't add any of my old or new contacts on my phone! Apple online chat support asked me to do all this step one more time, i.e. restoring it as a new iPhone, but nothing changed. I've tried going to my messages and add contacts via that, but that doesn't work either. Any help would be much appreciated!\n\nA: Your contacts may have been there all along.\nFirst you need to go to groups and select at least one before the + button will show up.\nIf you have no groups or no groups selected then the contacts have nothing to add to, therefore no button.\n\nGroup selected\n\n\nNo group selected\n\n", "Q: Log software usage time on Mac OS 9 (Oct. 1999) I'm needing to log the time a user spends inside of an application in Mac OS 9.

Once installed you just use mate <file> to open that file in text mate.\nFor application that don't have a command line tool, you can use the open command with the -a flag and the name of the application. i.e.\nopen -a iTunes\nThis also works for TextMate:\nopen -a \"TextMate 2\"\nThe executable file is located in the app's Contents/MacOS subfolder, so for TextMate 2, it would be:\n/Applications/TextMate\\ 2.app/Contents/MacOS/TextMate\nBut if you run it from the command line like that, it will hang the shell until the application is quit (on certain older OSs; this was resolved as of 10.8)  If this happens to you, put an & at the end of the command to background the process.  Such as:\n/Applications/TextMate\\ 2.app/Contents/MacOS/TextMate &\nThe problem with this is that if the shell exits (by quitting Terminal or closing the window) then TextMate is terminated without warning.\n\nA: I have made this apps for myself.

It provides information\n    about, and allows the administration of, the partitioning schemes, layouts, and\n    formats of disks. This includes hard disks, solid state disks, optical discs,\n    CoreStorage volumes, and AppleRAID sets.  It generally manipulates whole vol-\n    umes instead of individual files and directories.\n\nOn RAID:\nappleRAID | ar raidVerb [...]\n    AppleRAID verbs can be used to create, manipulate and destroy\n    AppleRAID volumes (Software RAID).  AppleRAID supports three basic\n    types of RAID sets:\n\n          o   \"stripe\" - Striped Volume (RAID 0)\n          o   \"mirror\" - Mirrored Volume (RAID 1)\n          o   \"concat\" - Concatenated Volume (Spanning)\n\n    Of these three basic types, only the \"mirror\" type increases fault-\n    tolerance.  Mirrors may have more than two disks to further increase\n    their fault-tolerance.  Striped and concatentated volumes are, in\n    fact, more vulnerable to faults than single disk volumes.\n\n    AppleRAID is not a replacement for backing up your data.  Backups\n    should be always be performed on a regular basis and before modify-\n    ing any RAID set using these commands.\n\nOn creating a new RAID:\n    create mirror | stripe | concat setName format devices ...\n               Create a new RAID set consisting of multiple disks and/or\n               RAID sets.  setName is used for both the name of the cre-\n               ated RAID volume and the RAID set itself (as displayed in\n               list). e.g. 'diskutil createRAID stripe MyArray JHFS+\n               disk1 disk2 disk3 disk4'.  Ownership of the affected\n               disks is required.  diskutil createRAID is a deprecated\n               synonym for diskutil appleRAID create.\n\n\nA: Easy, the Disk Utility program on OS X allows creation of software RAID.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility from spotlight or /Applications/Utilities\n\n*Type \"Create RAID\" into the help menu search term\n\n*Go to the article and follow the steps for Create a mirrored RAID set\nThis does involve erasing all drives, so you'll want to be sure everything is backed up elsewhere before starting. On 10.11 El Capitan, this feature in the Disk Utility graphical tool was removed, so you would need to call the underlying diskutil command that still has the RAID commands.\n", "Q: Is the power button on my iPhone being turned off programmatically? I would like to know if there is a code / glitch to make the sleep/wake button on the iPhone 5/5S to stop working. i am almost 100% certain it exists due to some programmers making the code but i want to know if anyone on here knows or heard about it.\n\nA: The likely cause is hardware failure, and not software.\n\nA: It is almost certainly a hardware failure. There is known hardware defect with some early iPhone 5 units that causes the sleep/wake button to stop working.\nApple has acknowledged the problem and is offering to repair devices that were manufactured with this defect.

If the mode is symbolic, a\n         starting value of zero is assumed and the mode sets or clears permissions without regard to the\n         process' file mode creation mask.  If the mode is octal, only bits 07777 (S_ISUID | S_ISGID |\n         S_ISTXT | S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXO) of the file's mode bits participate in the comparison.\n         If the mode is preceded by a dash (``-''), this primary evaluates to true if at least all of\n         the bits in the mode are set in the file's mode bits.  If the mode is preceded by a plus\n         (``+''), this primary evaluates to true if any of the bits in the mode are set in the file's\n         mode bits.  Otherwise, this primary evaluates to true if the bits in the mode exactly match the\n         file's mode bits.  Note, the first character of a symbolic mode may not be a dash (``-'').\n\nSo you need:\nfind . -type f -perm +0111 -print\n\nRemember that OS X is BSD-based, not Linux based, so the Gnu commands you're used to in Linux distributions (of which find is one of them) aren't necessarily the same as they are in OS X. This isn't a shell difference, it's an operating system/operating system utility tools difference.\n\nA: This will find all files (not symlinks) with the executable bit set:\nfind . -perm +111 -type f\n\nThis will also find symlinks (which are often equally important)\nfind . -perm +111 -type f -or -type l\n\nHere's how the command works if its not obvious:\n\n\n*\n\n*find is obviously the find program (:\n\n*. refers to the directory to start finding in (. = current directory)\n\n*-perm +111 = with any of the executable bits set (+ means \"any of these bits\", 111 is the octal for the executable bit on owner, group and anybody)\n\n*-type f means the type is a file\n\n*-or boolean OR\n\n*-type l means the type is a symbolic link\n\nA: A very old question, I'm aware, but searching for a solution I may have found a better answer. \nThe main problem with using \"find\" is that it relies on an attribute set to executable, even if this attribute is set for a non-executable file.\nMacOS comes with a handy little command-line tool \"file\", which displays file information, for example:\n$> file *\n\nDistribution:             directory\nSomeFile.icns:            Mac OS X icon, 3272878 bytes, \"ic09\" type\nMyPicture.png:            PNG image data, 1024 x 1024, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced\nNSHelpers.pas:            Algol 68 source text, ASCII text\nmyProgram:                Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n\nAs you can see, 'MyProgram' is an executable, and nicely indicated as such.\nSince old 32bit executables will have the phrase \"executable\" in this as well, the following should list all true executable (binaries):\nfile * | grep \"executable\"\n\nHope this will be useful to somebody looking for an answer to the same question as well. \nNote: file does not seem to have a function to recurse through subdirectories. \n\nA: I believe @Hanzaplastique is on the right path, but to do 'find' correctly, I would use:\nfind . -type f -exec bash -c \"file {} | grep 'executable'\" \\;\n\nYou can also add -name \"*some_wild_card*\" after the . to filter for specific type of executables.  And of course, you can replace bash with your favorite shell.\n", "Q: Identify the web site loaded in web view iOS application? I have an iPhone application that just shows a web page when you use it. I don't know the URL of the site it loads. Is there any way I can get the URL of the page the application loads?\n\nA: To determine the web site, you will need to intercept the network traffic travelling between your iPhone and your Internet Service Provider (ISP).\nTo do this you need to set your phone to use WiFi and to pass network traffic through a proxy. Proxies include squid and Charles.\nA good proxy will offer log files and allow you to see server addresses and, if not encrypted, requested URLs.\nAlternatively, you could contact the application developer and ask.\n\nA: No, You can't get the URL of the loaded page until the developer of that application intended to show the url.\n\nA: The other way to intercept the traffic apart from a proxy is to set up a sniffer, such as Wireshark.\nHere are some instructions from stackoverflow.\nIf you prefer to use command line tools you could also use tcpdump, which is available from the OS X command line.\nAnother good proxy which I used to use in my work is paros, but it has now been superseeded by ZED attack proxy from OWASP.\n", "Q: How dangerous is it to share my iTunes ID? Someone I one shared my iTunes library with, which contained purchased content from the iTunes store, contacted me and asked me for my iTunes ID because music they had copied from library in to their own library was causing iTunes to prompt them for this information.\nIt seems like I use my iTunes ID for so many things, I don't want someone else to have it.\nWhat's the danger in sharing this information?\n\nA: The danger is considerably high.\nSharing your iTunes ID with another person enables them to make media purchases from any of Apple's stores using the credit card information associated with the account. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes Music Store\n\n*iTunes Movie and TV Store\n\n*iOS App Store\n\n*OS X App Store\n\n*Apple's online store http://store.apple.com/\nThe would also be able to access your iTunes ID details and change billing information, address information, view purchase history, sign you up for any Apple-based subscription services like iCloud Storage or iTunes Match, etc.\nIt also allows the user access to your iCloud account and any email, documents, music, applications, purchases or address book entries you have stored there.\niCloud access could also be used, via Find my Mac/iPhone/iPad, to track your whereabouts if you've enabled the Find My services on any of your devices. They can also lock or permanently wipe the data from these devices, remotely, using the Find My services.\nMy advice to you is to tell your acquaintance to buy the tracks with their own money since they are, legally speaking, bound to you and your iTunes account by the terms under which you purchased them.\n", "Q: Problem with Apple ID while installing Mountain Lion I have been having problems installing Mountain Lion for a while now. First, it was with my Apple ID, which I created myself, and during the installation process, I got an error saying that my Apple ID has not been reviewed in the Apple Store. \nI also used my elder brother's, and now it say the Apple ID has not purchased Mountain Lion in the Mac App Store.\nSo, what's going on?\n\nA: Any Mac that could run Mountain Lion (10.8) is also capable of running Mavericks (10.9), which is a free download.  If you don't have a reason to stick with Mountain Lion, downloading a new copy of Mavericks with either of your ID's would be the simplest solution.\n\nA: Many Macs are not compatible with Mavericks, which is Apple's latest operating system for Macs. Here a support article with the system requirements for Mavericks: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5842\nNow let's get back to the Apple ID issue.\nWhat this issue is mainly telling you is that that Apple ID you used doesn't have Mountain Lion in your purchases. If you actually did use your brother's Apple ID there shouldn't be any problem. You can contact AppleCare (if your Mac is still covered under the warranty, if not there may be a charge) to talk about this and they will give you many solutions. I provided some solutions. To chat with an Apple Express Lane Specialist, go to http://www.expresslane.apple.com (again, it is complimentary if your Mac is currently under warranty).\nApple's number is : (1-800-MY-APPLE)\nwww.apple.com/support/contact\nIf you erased your hard drive, you should never erase the Mac OS X Base System since that has your installation information. There is maybe a way to reset that information but when you are booted onto OS X Utilities there is no finder application installed, it's nearly impossible. Like I said, try calling APPLE.\n\nA: Try booting into Internet Recovery Mode using COMMAND+R on your keyboard when you are at the boot screen of your mac, as soon as your Mac turns on, boots up, hit COMMAND+R on your Apple Keyboard.\nFrom there, install the Mavericks Installer and Run Install OS X.\nFor more detailed information on Internet Recovery Mode click here.\n\n", "Q: Automatically delete photo from Photo Stream when deleted in iPhoto or Aperture After importing photos I quickly delete all the duplicate photos & bad ones. However they all still make their way to my Photo Stream and stay there even after I've pruned the bad photos.\nIs there a way to automatically delete a photo in Photo Stream once it's been deleted in the Aperture or iPhoto library? \n\nA: Deleting the picture from My Photo Stream instead of the imported versions in your computer should do the trick. To do so just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the My Photo Stream view in either iPhoto or Aperture.\n\n*Select the pictures to delete.\n\n*Press the Delete key and click Delete.\n\n\nA: Tracking this back to the root makes me think disabling iPhoto's automatic download/import will solve the issue.\nYou can still keep the Photostream enabled, but you would have control to highlight the photos in it that you actually want to import and click 'Import Photo.' Or, highlight all the photos you don't ever want in Photostream, delete them from the Photostream, then afterwards highlight everything an select 'Import.'\nYes it's a bit more manual, but there aren't a lot of shades of gray with iCloud.\nI won't go as far as to suggest turning off Photostream though - it's an adequate last-resort backup, and when you delete photos from your iPhone camera roll, those photos won't actually come back to your iPhone, so there's no worry there.\n", "Q: How to Reverse Scrollwheel in Adobe Illustrator (holding Alt) using Karabiner?

I then switched to another ID new@gmail.com, so I removed old@gmail.com from my iCloud account and entered new@gmail.com. This was an year or so back.\nA few days back, I found an entry in the Keychain for old@gmail.com, so I deleted it. After that, I'm prompted one every reboot to enter the password for old@gmail.com:\n\nI cancel it, but it comes up after every reboot. I tried entering my iCloud password, but it doesn't work.\nHow do I get this prompt to go away and never come back?\n\nA: The application icon suggests the password is being requested by Messages.app.\nMessages.app\nLaunch Messages.app and check the accounts listed in the preferences do not include or mention your stale @gmail.com account.\n\nInternet Accounts\nLook for legacy accounts in your Internet Accounts within System Preferences.app:\n\nPreferences\nCheck your preferences for mentions of the old address using the Terminal.app command:\ngrep -r old@gmail\\.com ~/Library/Preferences/*\n\nIf this matches a file, modify the following command to examine the file's contents:\ndefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/MobileMeAccounts.plist > ~/Desktop/output.txt\n\nIn the example above, a new file called output.txt will appear on your desktop.

While I like preserving some of these video in original format for HQ viewing, I don't mind loosing some quality for others. Is there a quick way for doing so or do I need to import each separate video into a video-editing program and then export it again with the appropriate settings?\n\nA: I would use Handbrake which is a free encode/recode program.  You can batch files up, and choose various presets or your own choice of everything from resolution/bit rate/frames per second etc to decrease (you can never increase, obviously) the quality and therefore file sizes for your videos.  My top tip would be to simply reduce resolution but keeping the smaller size dividable by the larger size, so if your videos are in iPhone 4 640x960 then try 320x480 for optimal conversion.\nMany many other encoders are available, but most are paid solutions, and none are as fully featured in my opinion as Handbrake is.  Speed depends on your CPU as it is all done in software, but recent versions of the software have included support for either Intel Quick Sync (If you have a Sandy Bridge or above Core iX CPU) and also OpenCL for using your GPU as extra processing resources - however I have never tested these, so I can't say how fast they may or may not be, or even if you have access to them.  \nCertainly for small phone videos even just using non hardware accelerated encoding you should see it take no more than 1/4 to 1/2 of the normal playtime of the file to convert, and likely a lot less than that.\n", "Q: iCloud cannot enable Calendar and Reminders at the same time Recently to solve a problem I have been encountering related to iCloud, I had to sign out of iCloud and sign back in.\nNormally I have all the options enabled except for mail. When I signed in I started enabling all of the features and came across a problem where if I were to attempt to enable Calendar while Reminders is enabled, Calendar would say the words \"Setting Up\" and a spinner would appear and the checkbox would be greyed in. After about 20 seconds the words, spinner and checkbox clear away leaving Calendar still disabled.\nThis works the other way around if Calendar is enabled first and I attempt to enable Reminders.\nI have tried extremely basic things such as rebooting the system to clearing the cache files in the libraries but still nothing. Anyone got any ideas on how to fix this? Thanks!\n\nA: It's your firewall...I have TCPBlock on my system and encountered the exact same thing. Make sure you're allowing any sync services and iCloud to communicate with the outside world.\n\nA: Solved this problem a while back, but this was resolved by clearing all the iCloud cache files, along with system cache (local user library) and system library cache (though it may of not have been needed.)\nWhatever was in the cache must have been accessed by the services upon enabling them and treating it as all valid data without any checks, even though it may have been corrupt, outdated, mismatch or whatever other reason. I assume this was the cause as removing all cache directories such as ~/Library/Caches being the best place to start.\n", "Q: Need to print out iPhone text messages I have a court case and have text messages on my iPhone I need to transfer to my iPad email for evidence.  Every time I try it doesn't work, it will send them to my iMessage but not my email.  I need to print them out How do I do this?\n\nA: Okay, I think I see what's happening:\nAs it sounds like you may have already figured out, you can forward multiple texts by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Holding an individual text until the \"copy/more\" dialog pops up.\n\n*Picking \"More\"\n\n*Clicking the circle next to the left of each text you want to forward.\n\n*Clicking the \"share\" arrow on the lower right\n\n*Picking who you want to send them to\n\n\nBut, there are two possible problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"recipient\" you're picking in step 5 above is the recipient for a\ntext or iMessage; there's no way to select email instead.\n\n*The forwarded texts lose the \"speaker\" indicator, so with multiple texts, it's a little hard to see who said what.\n\n\nIf you only care about getting the messages into an email (and don't need the speaker) first issue, the easiest solution is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the text you forwarded yourself with all the texts lumped\ntogether (that you got by following the 5 steps above)\n\n*Hold your finger on it until \"Copy/More\" appears\n\n*Pick copy\n\n*Copy it into an email, and send it to yourself, print it, etc.\n\n\nIf you need to print something that indicates who was speaking, your best bet may be this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the beginning of the dialogue you want in your texts.\n\n*Hold the Home button, and press the power button without letting go of home.\n\n*You'll see a white flash, indicating that the hone took a screen capture.\n\n*If all the messages you needed didn't fit on one screen, scroll to the next set, and repeat. \n\n*Once you have done this for all the messages you need, go to the \"Photos\" app, and open \"Camera Roll\" - you'll see those screen captures as the most recent images.\n\n*Click \"select\" in the upper right corner, then select all the pics you need.\n\n*Hit the \"share\" button in the lower left corner, then pic \"Mail\"\n\n\nThat will let you email yourself (or anyone else) printable images of the text conversation.  Note that they'll be pics, so you can't edit the text, etc.\n\nA: There is an app called PhoneView that lets you view and print your messages as a PDF.\nsee it here http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/\nP.S. I am not in any way affiliated with ecamm. :-)\n\nA: If you want to print out few text messages then you can take the screen shots and email the pictures to your computer for printing or simply AirPrint the screenshots. You might also consider third party apps like Phoneview or Tansee to print out your text messages. This guide worth a look: http://www.iphone-to-pc.com/how-transfer-messages-iphone-pc.html \n\nA: I'm one of the developers for Decipher TextMessage, a program that will help you print your iPhone text messages. I've gotten feedback from many of our customers who use the software for that exact purpose, so I've spent some time adding features to help support using our printouts for court cases.\nThere's a plain-text printout export as well as a fancier export that you can use to print with the iPhone-like text bubbles and image previews. Everything includes the party names (from your phone contacts) as well as the phone number, so you should have all of the needed information on the printout.\nI hope this helps! You can try a free trial of our program on our website: http://deciphertools.com\n\nA: Forwarding messages from the messages app only allows sharing by messages, as you have found out.  I would question how useful this is anyway, as it strips out any useful meta information, including who said what, and instead just lists all the content with no context.  A better method although perhaps a little more time consuming might be to take screenshots.\nIf you swipe left to reveal the time and datestamps, then hold home and press power you should take a screenshot.  Take enough to show all your messages that you are interested in, and you can then wither just sync your photos to your PC or Mac, or even get clever and stitch them together into a single large image.  Benefits of this are that it is clear the context that they are sent in, and also clear that rather than being just a text copy that could have been altered they are clearly shown to be unaltered.\nPerhaps even better still because you clearly can edit images, is to use AirPlay mirroring to your Mac, and use Quicktime to record a video of the window as you slowly scroll down the list, occasionally left swiping to show timestamps.\n\nA: Speaking strictly of your desire to send particular messages to your inbox, there is a way that works with at least AT&T (I have tested it only with AT&T) as a cellular provider. You need the ability to send MMS messages.\nIt is actually a simple process than:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch off iMessage on your phone. \n\n*Tap and hold on a message that you would like to forward.\n\n*Select \"More\". \n\n*Select the Messages you would like to send. \n\n*\n\n*Note that these messages will be concatenated together.\n\n\n*Forward them to your email address. \n\n\nThey will arrive in your inbox from an email address like [your phone #]@mms.att.net.\n", "Q: Using bash/terminal to get number of battery recharge cycles I would like to get the number of recharge cycles using bash (terminal commands).

When we AirPlay the online stream on iPad to Apple TV, does the iPad remain in the chain (online stream to iPad and then iPad to Apple TV) or does the Apple TV virtually get and play that stream (online stream to Apple TV)?\n\nA: If you stream a video from the internet, and then AirPlay is to a suitable receiver like an Apple TV, then all the devices in the chain still take part.  The Apple TV doesn't simply get the stream location and other data like playback location, then stream it by itself, it get's a secondary copy that the iPad is essentially repeating onwards.\nYou can easily test this by streaming something, then airplaying it to the AppleTV, then turning airplane mode on the iPad - the Apple TV stream should fail.\n\nA: AirPlay works as follows: there is no handoff, the iPad pushes data to AppleTV the entire time AirPlay is engaged.\niOS will connect to AirPlay receivers and offer to mirror the screen. If the application that you run is programmed to do other things, it can then send different content to the TV, continue to mirror and do things like play in the background. If the app you use is simple or doesn't implement Apple's more advanced AirPlay features, then you will get the default mirror behavior without the app maker needing to take any step whatsoever.\n\nA: For some apps with AirPlay integration, the app will send the link for the video stream to the Apple TV which will then connect to the internet to play the content. I used a WiFi sniffer during AirPlay, which showed minimal wifi activity from my iPhone and considerate internet usage from the Apple TV. It also showed that the Apple TV was using the internet to stream a MP4 video. However, when I tried putting my iPhone into airplane mode, after a few seconds the video cut showing that a connection between the Apple TV and device is needed to play the video.\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure what the op means by \"AirPlay online stream\".  If you mean something like YouTube or some other app- or browser-based content, the iOS device is definitely in the loop.\nIf you mean for iTunes-purchased content, there is a way to \"stream from iCloud\", but it's not terribly clear either.

I use it to snap photos and subsequently sort them into albums on my phone. I also have an iPad and a PC laptop, but do not use the latter frequently to edit photos.\nWhat I (and I assume many other people out there) would like, is a simple functionality on  your iDevice (iPhone/iPad/etc) that basically two-way syncs pictures and albums between all devices. So, when I take a picture on my iPhone or iPad it should automatically be sent to a cloud (SugarSync, Google Drive, Dropbox, a private cloud, or similar) and from there be reflected on all my devices. Similarly, if I delete or modify a photo on one of my devices, that change should be reflected automatically on all the other devices.\nWith most paid-for clouds (such as SugarSync and Dropbox), you have one-way synching functionality of pictures. So when you take a photo, it is backed up to the drive. Sadly, it is not bidirectional, so if I delete a photo on one device, it is not reflected on the other devices.\nAs for Photo Stream and iCloud the problems are as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not sync the albums you create on your device.\n\n*You actually have to open iPhoto and make sure the images are imported to your computer, to avoid that they get deleted after the 30 day photo stream period is up.\n\n*You are stuck with iCloud, so if you decide to buy an Android phone, you will encounter a road block.\n\n\nAnyone have any information or thoughts on how to tackle this challenge? One thought would be to just use an alternative Camera and Photo app on the iPhone, that works with other clouds than iCloud. If you know of any such tools, please shout out.\n\nA: Try Unbound app. It uses dropbox to allow you to organize your photos on your ipad.

It seems it's always spinning non stop on Facebook.  I am concerned this indicates data usage.\n\nA: Yes it does.  To see how much, or to prevent data access to certain apps when on mobile/cellular visit Settings > Mobile (or Cellular) and scroll to the list of apps at the bottom, here you can see what is enabled for mobile access, and how much data has been used since the last reset point.\nYou can reset the stats back to zero from the same page any time you like.  This is useful if you know for example that your Data billing cycle starts on the 17th, and you can set yourself a reminder to reset it on that date.\nNote that the above is only really useful on iOS7, you don't say what version you use, if you use an older version the same rough idea applies only it's not split by individual applications, and you can't get granular detail or control.\n", "Q: Does letting services like PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB and Mysql run all the time eat up battery life and system resources? I'm a web developer and so I tend to run a lot of server applications on my machine to make local development easier.  Right now I use foreman to start the up as needed per project.  I do this in the belief that having them run all the time is just eating up resources since I don't always need them.  However I'm wondering if that is really the case or am I just being paranoid. Because having them run all the time would make things slightly easier.\n\nA: I've switched to running the services all the time instead of using foreman and I haven't really had any problems with battery life.\nI've also installed LaunchRocket which makes it easier to actually manage those services from the Settings.app.  I'm very comfortable in the command line however this just makes it super easy to start or stop the services.\nI'm also toying with the idea of using ControlPlane to have start or stop some of the services depending on if I'm at work or not. \n", "Q: What happens when a Mac SATA drive is put in a Dell laptop? I am planning to buy a Mac. But I see Mac uses same Intel processors as other Windows/Linux laptops. So I would like to know if I take a hard disk(say the Mac book is released before mid 2012, so the hard disk is not soldered) from the Mac book and use it in any other laptop (say a Dell) that supports the same size HDD. \nIs this possible? Have any one tried. Please help me. \n\nA: It depends on what you mean by \"use\".\n\n\n*\n\n*You may access files on that drive from Windows/Linux, provided you have driver for HFS+ filesystem (Linux could have it already installed, at least in read mode, Windows driver must be downloaded separately). (i.e. the hardware is 100% compatible - and would run well if you reformatted the drive for Windows / NTFS).\n\n*You certainly will not get the Dell to boot OS X simply by moving the parts. OS X has very limited drivers and they are tailored strictly to Mac hardware.\n\nA: Ummm, last I heard a hard drive is a hard drive. And one from a Mac is the same thing as one from a PC. So YES you should be able to take a hard drive out of a Mac and put it in a PC. \nThe exceptions being that some Macs (Macbook Air, Retina MacBook Pro, new MacPro) use a PCI based SSD EG not SATA). Those might be problematic (not seen a PC with a similar interface for an SSD) but I have no experience with this interface, YMMV.\nSo as long as the interface matches and it physically fits there are no drivers to worry about on either end (Windows or MacOS). The only thing you would want to look into is enabling TRIM on a new SSD installed in a Mac. there are utilities that can do that for you a Google search away...\n\nA: Yes - all HDD in Macs since the intel transition are 100% the same parts as commodity PC parts and would be reusable in a Dell. If your mac has an SSD, your chances are much reduced as the Retina and Air lines use non-standard parts.\nApple may have some custom firmware on the drives as an OEM purchaser, but I've never seen that cause problems (where putting some PC drives with non-Apple firmware can cause issues when you put those drives in a Mac - but it seems the Apple -> Dell direction isn't likely to cause any problems).\nThe rest of the thread about running OS X on Dell hardware is something that won't happen without breaking the license of OS X and also some engineering effort to modify the OS X software.\n\nA: No you can't.macbooks although they technically use the same hardware, the chips in Mac products are coded to look for specific \"elements\" in Mac OS. If there is no handshake between chip and OS,  Neither will operate!\n", "Q: /usr/bin/codesign from Mac 10.9 The /usr/bin/codesign file on our server was removed.  It is running version OS version 10.9.   Does anyone know where I can download the codesign file for OSX 10.9?

For  some reason my icloud.com mail account has appeared on my daughters side of the computer. If I delete this from her side will I delete it on my side( and consequently on my iPad and iphone)? Or can I simply delete my mail account from her mail programme.\n\nA: When you delete an iCloud account from OS X system preferences, nothing changes on Apple's server side. No data is lost, just your local copy is removed and the syncing stops.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out in one or all accounts\n\n*Sign back in on the Mac account where you want to use iCloud\n\n\nNo matter what I say, a Time Machine backup before starting any change is always a good thing, just in I wasn't clear to you or something goes wrong or I'm wrong.\n", "Q: Explanation for Ridiculously Slow Copy Speed I am backing up data files from one encrypted image to another.  They're text files ranging in size from a few hundred kilobytes to a few megabytes.  The process has become excruciatingly slow and is now clocking in at taking a 2 days to copy 8 gigabytes.\nI'm doing this with a Finder copy in OSX Lion.  I've tried using cp, rsync and ditto from the terminal but speed problems persist.  I've also noticed that the speeds are reasonable at the beginning of the copy process but get very bad roughly 10% of the way through.  They also improve temporarily following a reboot. Here's the io load during a copy:\nmac:~ me$ iostat 5\n\n      disk0           disk1           disk2           disk3 \nKB/t tps  MB/s     KB/t tps  MB/s     KB/t tps  MB/s     KB/t tps  MB/s  \n9.11  32  0.29   105.94  65  6.71     8.32 342  2.77   119.57  60  7.00 \n7.03   7  0.05    16.00   6  0.09     4.00 558  2.18     0.00   0  0.00 \n5.62   6  0.04   117.67  56  6.48     4.62 689  3.11     0.00   0  0.00\n\nSo I don't even know where to start in terms of diagnosing the cause.  Some things I've considered:\n\n\n*\n\n*The encryption keys vary across images, thereby requiring encrypting and decrypting\n\n*The image is close to full capacity\n\n*The drive holding the image is close to capacity\n\n*The file sizes can vary considerably\n\n*The destination is highly fragmented\n\n\nI can't rule any of these in or out though and don't know where to start looking to diagnose the problem\n\nA: OK - your iostat output is showing you that the disk2 spindle is the limiting factor. I would guess from the relative idleness of the other drives that you are copying from and to images stored on disk2. In that case, the head will seek back and forth and back and forth rather than filling up the drive buffer with lots of data.\nTypical hard drives cannot perform more than several hundred IO per second due to physical limitations of the head moving along with rotational speed limitations (some time is lost waiting for the drive to spin so the area where the write will happen is under the write head.).\nYou could try making sure the data being written is going to a physical disk different than the one where it is being read and see a substantial speed up.\nIt might be faster to first copy the disk image to one of your other three drives, do the copy and then delete the source image from the \"temporary\" location.\n", "Q: How to watch a 1080p video on retina display with a 1:1 pixel ratio (with no scaling up)? I am trying to watch a 1080p video on my Macbook Retina 13 but it is scaled up to the 'scaled resolution' 1280x800. If the video is scaled down to 1280x800 before being displayed, I will be losing in precision.\nVLC for example claims to support Retina Displays but that seems to only concern the fonts and not the video.\n\nA: You can't watch any full screen video that is not in the exact native display resolution without scaling. At least in my knowledge.\nThe question is - is the scaling good or not. You may try different players.\nIf you want pixel to pixel mapping, you can only set the player size to 100% of the video, and it'll show as one of the windows on the screen, depending on the video file resolution - but only that way will you have the pixel-accurate playback.\nSomebody correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nA: You can change scale option in System Preferences—›Displays. Maximum scaled down resolution for MBP Retina 13 is 1680x1050. It's not perfect solution — you still won't get accurate 1080p nor native 2560x1600, —  but it's definitely better than 1280x800.\n\n", "Q: Send/Receive on two numbers How can I receive my husbands text messages without him receiving mine?

I've been playing this game for a month until it started to have this error everytime I launch it: the application just keeps bouncing on the dock and does not open even for an hour of waiting. Force Quit option do not work but when I click on the \"bouncing\" icon on the dock, it disappears. The application is not the \"Force Quit application\" list when I hit command + option + esc. Any workaround on this error?\n\nA: Disclaimer: I do not own Borderlands 2 and so I cannot predict what the results of this process will be. Your safest bet is to go the Mac App Store page for Borderlands 2 and use the Borderlands 2 Support link. All Mac App Store apps are required to have a ‘support’ link, although some are more useful than others. The one for Borderlands 2 looks like it will lead to actual, official support, so I suggest you try that first.\nThat being said, the following is the troubleshooting technique that I use when trying to figure out why a Mac App Store app won’t launch.\nUse at your own risk, etc. Remember that I’m just some guy on the Internet (allegedly!) giving you free, un-guaranteed advice. I almost always have a complete, recent, fully bootable backup on my Mac just in case something goes wrong. So should you, especially before mucking around with stuff.\n1) Quit The App\nWe’re going to be moving the app’s preferences file, and you don’t want to do that when it is running. That would be a bad idea.\n2) Use the Finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Go → Go to Folder menu item\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter ~/Library/Containers/ as shown here:\n\n\n\nClick “Go” (or press Enter) and you will see all of the various “Containers” used on your Mac.\nn.b.: Tread carefully. Apple hides the ~/Library/ folder because mucking around in there can cause problems. \nThis is what mine looks like:\n\nYours will look different but similar. Hopefully you will be able to tell which one goes to the you are trying to fix.\nI am going to use com.multimarkdown.composer.mac (MultiMarkdown Composer 2) just because it’s easier to work with a specific example.\nFind the “Saved Application State” folder for the app which will not open.\nYou will find it inside the app’s “Container” folder (above) → Data → Library → Saved Application State\n\nInside that folder will be one more, which ends with “.savedState” and contains the information used to restore the windows which were open when you quit the app.\nMove that folder to the Desktop, or even the Trash if you want. Then re-launch the misbehaving app.\nIf it still won’t launch I’d repeat the process but instead look inside the ”Preferences” folder instead of ”Saved Application State” and I’d look for the file which doesn’t look like a link or an alias (in this case, com.multimarkdown.composer.mac.plist) and I would copy that file to the Desktop or the Trash, understanding that I was effectively deleting all of my saved preferences. Then re-launch the misbehaving app.\nIf that didn’t work, well, then I’d probably do something desperate like move the app’s entire folder from ~/Library/Containers/ (such as ~/Library/Containers/com.multimarkdown.composer.mac/) to the Desktop or the Trash and try one last time.\nAfter that I might even delete the app and download it again from the Mac App Store.\n(If you need to see any of the images in a larger size you can find them all at http://media.tjluoma.com/askdifferent/116501/.)\n\nA: my friend is having the same problem with league of legends.

I have a process, which has worked faithfully for years in Numbers '09, whereby I download my Bank account data in CSV format, then drag that data directly into my Numbers sheet (after creating an appropriate number of blank rows).  \nThis no longer works, and I can't find an option to import csv! A help search within numbers for 'csv' returns a single result which describes exporting.\nI've tried the old method, no dice.

This didn't work, my file was already csv, properly formated etc. No, changing to txt did the trick.\nI'm finding it harder and harder to recommend switching from Microsoft to Apple. This sort thing just shouldn't be happening.\n\nA: I have faced a similar problem: after exporting a csv file from MySQL I tried to open directly into Numbers but it did not open correctly so I tried to drag the file onto an open sheet and it also and did not work.\nThen I read lot of things on Internet about how Numbers deals with comma, so I exported the data once again switching comma (,) for semicolon (;) and voilà!\n\nA: Dragging and dropping a CSV onto a table works again since v3.2!\nCurrently in v6, I find that I can drag data onto an existing table, but it will overwrite the table's contents.\nTo preserve existing rows:\n\n\n*\n\n*select the file in Finder and Copy\n\n*select the target cell in your target table (usually the last row in column A)\n\n*Paste\nWhen selecting the target cell, you may want to hit Escape to ensure you're not in edit mode.\n\nA: Simple solution for getting a csv file to open correctly on a Mac. Change the csv file extension to txt. Then right click on it and open with Numbers.\n\nA: Use 'tab' delimited fields - works perfectly.\n\nA: In Verson 6 of Numbers I was able to just highlight the data in the column of the CSV I needed and dragged the data to the excel template I had been given. \nThe company would no longer except the milage report from the app on my phone. The app would export a CSV file of the data.\nThe report from the app had a lot more columns and headers than the company supplied excel template. \nI was able to just highlight the dates in the dates column of the report and drag it to the dates column of the template. The same with other necessary columns.

format it to eXFAT. Every time I hit \"erase\" in disk util it just comes up with the error \"couldn't unmount disk\". Btw, I am running on Maverick. Can anyone help me with this please?\n\nA: I had the same problem with the same drive. I finally got it to work by rebooting from the recovery partition and formatting it using the disk utility option.\n\nA: It's proper for the operating system to not unmount a volume if there is, on the volume, an open file that can not be closed. \nRecommended reading\nThe accepted answer to The volume can't be ejected because it's currently in use\n\n\n*\n\n*note the comment about use of sudo\nThe Mac App Store page for WhatsOpen\nPosts that mention What's Keeping Me?, e.g. https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/22268/8546\nThere's another comparable app but at the moment I can't recall its name. \n", "Q: 2013 Macbook Pro 13\" - Running 2 monitors (not thunderbolt) Can I run 2 non thunderbolt monitors off a 2013 13\" Retina Macbook Pro? One connected via HDMI, and one connected via a Thunderbolt to HDMI adaptor?\nAnd if so, can I also run the laptop screen at the same time?\n\nA: Yes, what you're suggesting will definitely work and you can use all three displays at once (MacBook display + HDMI display + Thunderbolt/HDMI display). This is the Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter that I personally use and recommend.\n\nA: Certainly the two external monitors will work and although I haven't tried it, the internal display should still function since it's not listed as being dark like on the lesser Macs here where connecting an external causes the internal to be dark intentionally.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5219#18\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 15 inch Late 2011 - Internet always slow until I change DNS lookup address This problem has plagued me across multiple networks (Ethernet and Wi-Fi, across multiple ISP's) and multiple operating systems (Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion, Mavericks).\nWhile browsing, my internet will completely slow down, images will load terribly slowly and youtube just won't work.\nIf I change my DNS in network prefs, everything starts working beautifully again for the next 10 minutes or so until it slows down again.\nI need to keep switching between Google's DNS and my ISP's DNS continuously so I can use the internet. \nDoes anyone know the issue and what could fix it? Thanks for your help!\nEdit: \n\n\n*\n\n*Further information - Images / videos take super long to come through but most of the time text will show up with / without styling.\n\n*The laptop was purchased from outside the US but I'm currently residing in the US.\n\nA: I can think of 4 possible reasons:\nBad hardware config\nIt's worth re-setting the NVRAM in your machine by holding Command, Shift, P and R while booting. You'll hear a chime - keep holding, then you hear another chime - let go. This is safe to do.\nBad/Broken Network (Filter) Driver\nThere's also a possibility you have a bad network driver installed, perhaps against your knowledge, or maybe a leftover from some software. Try booting in Safe Mode (hold Shift as your machine boots) and see how the internet performance is (everything will be slow in this mode, but if it's a driver issue you should see a difference in the browsing).\nMalware Infection\nThe last time I saw this behaviour turned out to be a rampant malware infection on the computer which was saturating the internet connection by sending out spam email. Changing the network/IP details temporarily interrupted the malware until it work up again. You may be able to see this in Activity Monitor (all processes, look at network tab, anything using a lot of networking while you don't do any browsing?). It is worth doing an anti-malware and/or virus scan to eliminate this risk.\nIt's time to do a fresh install\nHave you upgraded your OS from Leopard thru Mavericks? Ever done a 'nuke-and-pave' / erase-and-reinstall? Might be worth it in your case - you can restore your data from a TimeMachine backup (make sure you have one!), but do not have to restore the whole system. It depends on how much software you'd have to spend time reinstalling, but this has worked well in the past for people I've worked with.\n\nA: I'm betting you are outside the US.\nIf you use the Google DNS Server then you will find that a lot of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) will deliver you content from a US server. This will be slower than a closer server.\nThe delay in the problem is because your Mac is caching the DNS answer for a short time. Why some machines and not others is a bit of a puzzle but I suggest you try using your ISPs DNS servers for both secondary and primary for a few days and see if the problem goes away.\nCheck this out http://apcmag.com/why-using-google-dns-opendns-is-a-bad-idea.htm and this http://joemaller.com/2577/itunes-slowdowns-with-google-dns/\n", "Q: How to use Wake On Demand? I want to setup wake-on-demand as described here so I can remote wake up my computer and ssh into it while I am oversea.\nMy iMac did not have ethernet connection and I want to wake-up it using Wifi.\nThats what I have:\niMac 27-inch, Mid 2011, Software  OS X 10.9.1 (13B42)\nAirPortExpress, version 7.6.4\nRaspberry-pi\nISP-provided router (Technicolor TG582n)\nMy Raspberry-pi is always on so it is fine if I need to ssh into it first to wake up my iMac.\nI have follow the instructions provided in the article for iMac. But I don't know how to actually wake up my computer.\nFrom Bonjour Browser, I can see that my AirPortExpress is publishing _sleep-proxy._udp so I think it have Bonjour-Sleep-Proxy on.\n\nFor some reason, I found this line in the log\n\nmDNSResponder[47]: BeginSleepProcessing: en1    not capable of magic packet wakeup\n\nwhereas en1 is my wifi interface. But from System Information\nen1:\n  Card Type:    AirPort Extreme  (0x168C, 0x9A)\n  Firmware Version: Atheros 9380: 4.0.74.0-P2P\n  MAC Address:  04:54:53:0f:c9:b1\n  Locale:   APAC\n  Country Code: ES \n  Supported PHY Modes:  802.11 a/b/g/n\n  Supported Channels:   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140\n  Wake On Wireless: Supported <--- is this lying to me?\n  AirDrop:  Supported\n  Status:   Connected\n\n\nA: Both lines are correct. You WiFi card supports Wake-On-Lan (WOL) but the link across it does not.\nIt's almost impossible to get WOL working across a net of any size as it relies on sending and receiving broadcast UDP packets on port 7 or 9 and broadcast packets are rarely routed.\nTo get it working you would need to reconfigure your home router and set up a VPN between the router and the device you want to send the WOL packet.\n\nA: You need another computer to try to access the sleeping Mac for something.  The easiest way to test this is with a dedicated WOL client testing program like this from another machine on the LAN.  I note that you don't appear to have 2 Macs, but if you google around you will find a way to WOL from whatever build you have on your Pi (likely just a telnet operation using a specific port).  This will prove that the Mac is setup correctly, and you can then proceed to test further by attempting to access some service on the sleeping Mac, like a web server etc, presumable from your Pi, as that seems to be the only other client you describe on your LAN.\n\nA: Your Airport Express should handle the WoL functionality for you. Simply setting up port forwarding to your Mac should work fine.  The sleep proxy will see the packet and wake up the host.  If you already forward port 22 to your Raspberry Pi, then you'll either have to set your port forward to listen from a different port of your choosing, then forward that to port 22 on the Mac.\nBe sure your Mac supports Wake on Wireless. Your logs do seem to conflict.  Check system preferences and see if you can enable \"Wake for Wi-Fi network access\" or \"Wake for network access\" per the document you referenced.  If it says \"Wake for Ethernet network access\" then you can't wake over Wi-Fi.\nThe other answers suggest VPNs or WoL programs, but that really isn't necessary since you have the AirPort Express acting as the sleep proxy for you.\n", "Q: Can someone clarify how many (and what types) of display the new MacBook Pro can use? I have the new (late 2013) MacBook Pro 15\" with Retina display, the model with Intel Iris Pro graphics and not Nvidia.\nI was wondering, firstly, how many displays it can possibly drive at once without buying Thunderbolt displays. 1xHDMI and 2xThunderbolt adaptor?\nAnd secondly, can this drive a 4K display properly? (When I say properly, I mean at a smooth frame rate, such as 30fps +). If I use a 4K display, how many other displays can I have attached? Could I have a 4K display + 1080p display? Two 4K displays? etc.\n\nA: I'm going to start off backwards. 4k Display will require some sort of cable, wether DVI, Display port, or Thunderbolt that is from manufacturer to manufacturer and model to model different. According to the tech specs of 4K it is compatible with Display port 1.2.\nAccording to : http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-retina/\n\"Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors\"\nThis could however simply be that Apple has only tested it on displays with that resolution and once 4k displays are out in the real world people can test it. \nSo your MBP Retina can support 2 external displays and the use of the the clamshell display at the same time. Those external display can be attached via HDMI and Thunderbolt (adapters) or both via Thunderbolt adapters. But so far the tech specs limit the resolution to 2560x1600. It could also be that the resolution output could be enhanced with a software update (firmware update) at a later time.\nArchived Specifications page: \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) - Technical Specifications\n\n*Other MacBook Pro models.\n\n", "Q: How do I enable automatic capitalization in OS X? Can I turn on automatic capitalization on my iMac running OS X 10.9, Mavericks? It is selectable in iOS on my iPad but I can't find a similar switch in Mavericks.\n\nA: You can use a third party such as TextExpander ($35) for this. Paired with the right third party dictionary (TidBITS Autocorrect Dictionary), which is downloadable from within TextExpander, it corrects most of my typos that Mac OS X misses, as well as providing shortcuts for frequently typed snippets.\nUsing TextExpander just for sentence capitalization is a bit of overkill, but if you embrace it, you wind up with an excellent tool that you can easily adapt to your needs.\n\nA: It's not available yet on Mavericks as such.  You can ask Apple to add it via\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback\nSome apps might have it internally (but Pages 5 does not, only Pages 4).\n", "Q: Setup local network on Mac and share it via WiFi, but with no internet connection I woat to use my iPhone as remote control for VLC.

If it isn't there then open Network in System Preferences to make sure WiFi is on and you have Show Wi-Fi status in menu bar selected.\nSelect Create Network... which will open up a dialog where you can specify a network name and security.

It works fine for accessing internal resources, but getting out to the internet over the VPN can be spotty. (Not because sites are blocked. It's just slow.)\nIs there a way to segment traffic so that VPN works over the ethernet connection but access to the internet goes over wifi?\nI don't have a lot of experience with networking but I'm comfortable with the Terminal and shell scripting.\n\nA: Depending on the VPN client being used, this may or may not be possible. Certain VPN clients (like Junos Pulse, for example) can be set by your network administrator at work to enforce certain routing policies when connected via your VPN client. If your sysadmin at work set your VPN client to force all outgoing traffic to go through your VPN then you're most likely out of luck (I know that Junos Pulse can be set to automatically disconnect if the routing table is touched once connected). As your sysadmin at work how it's configured.\n\nA: I think this can be done with Server Order in Network Preferences.\nGo to System Preferences, under Network. In the left side panel, there's a tool menu, and you can find a menu item that lets you change your Service Order.\nA CNET guide is available also.\nI'm not sure if that will work as things that depend on VPN may go through the most prioritized connection and get denied.\n", "Q: Opening a CBR with Archive Utility; avoiding cpgz/zip loop I'd like to use Archive Utility (the built-in OSX archive tool) to decompress some .cbz and .cbr files. Unfortunately, Archive Utility doesn't seem to recognize .cbz or .cbr as a zipped file, so if I try to \"Open With\" Archive Utility, it re-zips the file; if I try to \"Expand Archive\" from Archive Utility itself, it doesn't recognize the extension and won't allow me to select the greyed-out file. \nWhen I rename a .cbz to .zip file, Archive Utility works fine. \nWith .cbr files, however, after I rename the extension to .zip, Archive Utility will rezip as a .zip.zip file (or .zip.cbgz file, depending on my settings in Archive Utility). If I open that .zip.zip file in Archive Utility, it will extract it back to a regular .zip file, but it remains an unopenable archive. \nAny ideas on how I can force an unzip?\nDue to administrator settings (I'm on a work computer), I must use Archive Utility and can't easily have any other unzip or archive software installed. \nEdit: I've also tried it from the terminal using the \"open\" command with the same (.zip.zip) results. \n\nA: The Apple's Archive Utility seems incapable to unpack some archives including some legitimate .zip files.\nI looked at several GUI alternatives to set as default instead of the Archive Utility and settled on The Unarchiver which seems to be a seamless replacement.\nIf you have homebrew installed then it is:\nhomebrew cask install the-unarchiver\n\nOpen the app and set the default file types it should handle. You can also check to option to open the extracted archive in a new Finder window.\nAlso some file managers like Midnight Commander (brew install mc) or Double Commander (brew cask install double-commander) will handle the archive correctly.\n\nA: You might either have damaged files or most likely you need to try a different utility to unpack the archives. Example: http://jomic.sourceforge.net\nArchive Utility is great for zip, tar, 7z and a few others but not everything... CBZ is a subset of zip meaning it uses the same algorithm but the output file is not what archive utility expects (a Comic Book Archive). \n\nA: I could see a two step process for this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Test the cbr file in terminal. unzip file.cbr\n\n*Make an Automator task for unzipping the files that don't work with a rename and renaming the files that can then be passed to Archive Utility\n\n\nYou might also be able to flatten this to just using terminal - anything you can script can easily be turned into an Application with Automator so you could just use it to handle dropping files onto the \"script\" and have all the logic be in the shell script. On the other hand, Automator can rename files and then open them in another application besides the default one.\nMy hunch is that the cbr file isn't really a valid zip file and if it were, Archive Utility should have unzipped it instead of zipping it. However, I've seen lots of cases where Archive Utility gets confused with zip files (iWork for example) and thinks it's too smart to just try to decompress a file and relies on file metadata hints more than a command-line tool does.\n\nA: You could use YACReader, to read the comic book file. From the description:\n\nYACReader is the best comic reader and comic manager with support for cbr cbz zip rar comic files. It is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X.\n\nAt the time of writing, the current version is 8.5.0\nOnce opened in YACReader, you can save the images within the .cbr file, as JPEGs.\n", "Q: how to make each display a separate space, yet have a keyboard shortcut to move both screens at the same time? In OS X Mavericks, each display (ie monitor) has it's own space. There are many advantages to that.\nBut then there are also advantages to the old way of doing it; i.e i want both my  [monitor 1  - space 1] & [monitor 2 - space 1] to be for my Xcode app. And the [monitor 1 - space 2] [monitor 2 space 2] for my chrome  and so on so forth.\nThe Preferences offers you the option of going either the old way or new way via the Display have separate spaces option:\n\nHowever I want the best of both worlds: I want each screen to have its own space.. but then I also want a keyboard shorcut where I can move both screens at the same time. How is that possible?\n\nA: I wanted to do something similar. While I'm not sure it's possible to make the \"Move left\" and \"Move right\" shortcuts behave like you want (at least not without a third-party tool), you can get pretty close with the \"Switch to Desktop [n]\" shortcuts. Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Mission Control, add or remove desktops from both displays so you have the same number on both. I was using 5 in Mountain Lion, so when I first booted into Mavericks, I had 5 on my primary display and only one (\"Desktop 6\") on my secondary display. I simply added 4 new desktops to my secondary display, so now I have 10 in total. The result looks something like this:\n\n\nPrimary display with Desktops 1-5\n\nSecondary display with Desktops 6-10\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and select the Mission Control category.\n\n*Set one shortcut for each \"pair\" of desktops, like so:\n\n(Of course, this will result in some conflicting shortcuts, but it doesn't seem to be a problem. One shortcut still fires both actions.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ctrl-1 through ctrl-5 (or whatever set of shortcuts you chose) to switch between each pair: ctrl+1 for Desktop 1 on the primary display and Desktop 6 on the secondary, ctrl+2 for Desktop 2 and Desktop 7, and so on.\n\n\nSeems like a bit of a hack I know, but at least it matches the behavior that I was used to in Mountain Lion while maintaining the benefits of the improved multiple monitor support in Mavericks.\nEDIT: I just noticed that this can cause some odd behavior when switching desktop pairs. For one, after you land on a desktop, the menu bar flashes erratically and eventually focuses on one display or another, seemingly randomly. It also seems to mess with the application-switching, in that it doesn't always focus on the application or window that you would expect it to. (Perhaps there's a conflict there between the most recently used application globally and the most recently used on that particular desktop? I'm not sure.) I'll keep playing around with it, but that could be a dealbreaker for me. Luckily, I still have the option of switching back to pre-Mavericks behavior if necessary.\n\nA: When I updated to mavericks I wanted to be able to do exactly what you say. But then I realized it far more easy selecting first the application you want to use ( Command + Tab ) and then the windows of the current application ( Ctrl + down and left or right to get the right one ). It works to select the window even if it's in another space and then you will be changing between monitors.\nSo for example I usually have more than one chrome window, one for each monitor, so if want to change between the bigger to the small one, I first select the Google Chrome App, then Ctrl + Down ( to see al chrome windows ) and the right and left to change from the big monitor to the small one.\nI hope it's useful\n", "Q: Lost Mail when removed pop account to re-add as imap account I removed an mail account from the mail application because it was configured as pop and had to be imap. Now I have lost my mail which was stored locally. I have read about iskysoft data recovery, but that tool has a folder structure which is huge. So I am clicking around in folders to see if there is any mail from 2011 etc.\nI am not so familiar with Mac OS X and the mail application. These are times when you would want to have an up-to-date timecapsule backup, but that one is from november 2013 :S\nCan you suggest a better mail recovery tool or a manual recovery? Or tell me that this is the right tool and that this will solve all my problems and will put back the lost e-mails in the Mail application.\n\nI have just read about disk drill. but that is no option for me (I think) because I should have used 'recovery vault' first. before removing the pop3 account. http://help.cleverfiles.com/mailbox-recovery-2/\n\nA: You're going to have a hard time recovering the files and should power off the machine / only mount that drive in read-only mode until you have given up on the idea of data recovery.\nI like Data Rescue 3 - but your tool will probably be mostly equivalent.\nLook to recover ~/Library/Mail and ~/Library/Mail Downloads files if possible.

I waited for, like, 10-15 minutes. Why? \nCommand auto-update.sh runs easily if executed manually. How can I break apart the chain of execution and get my script running from cron?\n\nA: It's tough to tell, but what if you added a second cron job to execute every 5 minutes or so and have it call some system built tool that logs messages to system.log?\n0,5,10,15,20 * * * * /usr/bin/logger \"cron is working\"\n\nThat way you'll know that cron is running for the user in question and can focus on either starting cron or fixing your script so it runs in the limited cron environment. (You can look at the wall clock and pick a few times that are coming up soon or even the next few minutes - e.g. editing at 12:34 put in 35,36,37,38 for the minutes to run and save the cron file.)\n\nA: It's been a while that you asked this question, but it seems that no solution came up in this thread.\nDepending on the way you create a user-crontab, it might be necessary to execute this after editing it:\ncrontab ~/.yourcrontabfile\n\nTo see if the new crontab (also after modifying it) has been activated, check with:\ncrontab -l\n\n\nA: The environment a cron job runs in is quite a bit different from an interactive shell; it's likely that the script is running, but not successfully. One of the biggest differences are that for cron jobs, the default PATH is just \"/usr/bin:/bin\", so if you use any commands that aren't in /usr/bin or /bin, they won't be found unless your script either sets its own PATH, or supplies explicit paths to commands. The other big difference is simply that it's not connected to an interactive session, so if it tries to do anything interactive (read from the terminal, etc) that'll fail. Try changing the cron entry to:\n*/2 * * * * /Users/[my user]/Dropbox/htdocs/auto-update.sh >>/tmp/auto-update.log 2>&1\n\n...and see if anything informative shows up in the log.\n\nA: I had the same problem. You need to add the path to your bash script:\n#!/bin/sh\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.

A fresh install on new hardware under load will have this issue. Downgrading to 10.9.x, hoping 10.14 fixes it or installing Linux are the only solutions I am aware of. Apple had no comment, and is unlikely to fix it as new hardware contains SSDs that hide this issue.\n\nA: Killing coreaudio did not work for me.\nBut then I have noticed that this behavior happens when running Android Studio connecting to an Android device.  Apparently the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) has some conflict which causes sluggish behavior with the volume and screen brightness function keys.\nSolution:  Shut down Android Studio and disconnect the device.  Make sure that Android Transfer program is not running either (it'll show up in Activity Monitor).  Yeah, it's not an optimal solution, but it works for me.\nI don't expect many of you to be Android programmers, but if you are, this just might be the fix you're looking for.\n\nA: Do you have an APC UPS?\nI was having this exact problem after upgrading to Mavericks yesterday, and found that force-quitting apcupsd (a UPS controller daemon) instantly removed the delay.\nIf this doesn't help then you could try force-quitting other third party daemons that perform similar tasks to apcupsd.\n\nA: Next helps:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist\n\n\nA: I have found that delays from the Apple wireless keyboard or mouse are Bluetooth related (ie interference). My Apple Watch rarely unlocks my laptop but each time it tries my mouse becomes very laggy. I'd suggest disabling Bluetooth on nearby devices which are not actively using Bluetooth to perform actions. Likewise, check for anything which could be causing signal loss, large metal objects or electrical items.\n\nA: In your sound preferences go on the 'Sound Effects' tab and turn off 'Play feedback when volume is changed'. \nThis solved the delay for me.

Why is my iPhone making a mystery tritone sound when the sound is on, and a mystery vibrate when set to silent? Yes, yes, I already read this answer: Why does my iOS device beep at noon every day?. I learned the same thing at the Genius Bar. But I've already turned \"Sounds\" off in every app that doesn't appear in my notification center. So, now what?\n\nA: It turns out that there is one app that does not have a \"Sounds\" setting, but still produces sounds and vibrations: Calendar. It's easy to overlook the all-important setting \"Calendar Alerts.\" Tap that, tap vibrate, scroll all the way to the bottom, and set vibration to \"None.\" That should solve it.\nHere's your problem right here:\n\nJust turn vibration off:\n\nThat's right!\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to use airdrop on iphone4?

All of the preference pane locations mentioned in the Apple documentation contained no mention of the preference pane in question.\nWhat I found was one potentially relevant preference pane in a cache and the preference pane cache itself.\nTo clear the preference pane cache, just move the ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.preferencepanes.cache file to the trash or delete it by some other means. This may be all that you need to fix the issue. If it's not...\nI also removed a file (~/Library/Caches/com.github.osxfuse.OSXFUSEPrefPane) that could have been relevant, but may not have been. I removed the file before clearing the preference pane cache, so I'm unable to say which definitively solved the issue.\n", "Q: Can I change which external monitor is considered the \"secondary\" monitor? I've got a MacBook Pro, and two Thunderbolt displays. I'd like to be able to change the brightness on them individually, like so:\nFor the MacBook, I'd use the F1/F2 keys on its keyboard.\nFor the first Thunderbolt Display, I'd use the F1/F2 keys on my USB keyboard.\nFor the second Thunderbolt Display, I'd use CTRL+F1/CTRL+F2 on my USB keyboard, as outlined in this AskDifferent answer.\nHowever: the CTRL+F1/CTRL+F2 keys on my USB keyboard currently map to my MacBook's brightness - so now I've got two ways to change my MacBook's brightness, and zero ways to change my secondary Thunderbolt display.\nIs there a way to re-map the CTRL+F1/CTRL/F2 commands, so they control the secondary Thunderbolt display?\n\nA: I don't know how this applies to the mapping.

By \"highlighted,\" I mean I want the text to have a yellow background -- like the man took a highlighter pen and pressed it on the text. The only solution I've found takes five steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click 'Format' in toolbar.\n\n*Click 'Style'.\n\n*Click the Gear.\n\n*Click the 'Character Fill Color' Button.\n\n*Click the yellow crayon from the Colors popup.\n\n\nHere's a screenshot from my computer showing the man's trial with the thing, digging nose-first with each highlight, using the five separate steps:\n\nMy question is: Is there a way for me to perform this simple highlight operation in less than five steps? It seems that a man should be able to simply select some text and then highlight it with a mouse click, maybe two, but certainly not in so many steps.\n\nA: ⇧ Shift-⌘ Cmd-H is the new shortcut (or Insert > Highlight from the menu). \n\nA: In Pages 5, you could define highlighted text as a \"character style\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Select some text in your document \n\n*Click on the \"a\" with the red cross behind in in your font toolbar and choose the color you'd like to use as highlighted text for your document\n\n*Go to View -> Show Styles Drawer \n\n*Select the highlighted text once again\n\n*Under \"character style\" to the right of \"none\" there should be an arrow. Click that and select \"create new character style from selection\".\n\n\nA: You can supposedly save your formatting style in Pages 5 so that it can be re-used - that makes it accessible in future with only a few actions (select text, open format panel if not open, and then select the style from the menu). Unfortunately this doesn't appear to stick around - after creating a new document - I found it had dropped the style. So one option here would be to create yourself a pages document that is a palette of the styles you use frequently,  then you can use it to copy the style from as you need it as copy-style/paste-style works across documents. Not ideal but might save you a bit of time.\nCopy the style (Format > Copy Style or shift-command-C)\nPaste style  (Format > Past Style or shift-command-V)\n\nA: The most expedient method I have discovered is as follows:\nEnsure the \"Text\" formatting side-menu is open, and follow the steps associated with Chad Decker's screen-shot (see top of this web-page)\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the \"Advanced Options\" menu\n\n*Click the \"Character Styles\" tab\n\n*Click the \"+\" tab to \"create a character style based on selected text\"\n\n*Name the new character style (e.g., \"Highlight\")\n\n\nWhen you want to highlight text, select the text, click the \"Characters Styles\" tab, then select \"Highlight\" from the drop-down menu.\nSadly, this \"fix\" is not preserved upon quitting the Pages application.\n\nA: I have found the simplist way to avoid the 5 step solution is to set up a style as described above, include all the other formatting you want to be \"standard\" (font, borders, heading, etc.) and then save that as a template.  You can re-arrange the order of styles so all you have to do is highlight your text and choose the style you want to apply from the drop down menu.  Because the document is opened from a template, the highighting style you created is always available.  I prefer using the background color change rather than the comments method of highlighting because comments don't print and aren't shown if you save your document as a pdf.\n\nA: I found one simple solution.\nDisadvantages of solutions, which listed here.\n1. New 'Character styles' affected to the whole paragraph.\n2. Shift + Cmd + H highlighted text is printing like an ordinary\n3. Format - Style - blah-blah Too slow\nSo, here is what I found (Pages 6.3.1).\nRight click on tools panel -> Change tools panel -> Add 'Copy style' and 'Insert style' (Look for icons in image).\nNow you firstly need to highlight text like 3 (format- style-...), then select formatted text, 'copy style'. Select text you want to highlight, 'insert style'. Enjoy!\n\n\nA: you can also go to format and under layout there should be something that says background and you can change the background to any color and it will only change that specific line \n\nA: All of this is outdated in the latest version of pages all you have to do is select the text which you want and hold shiftcommand and h, or alternatively go to the edit bar at the top of the page and click highlight.\n\nA: Select your text. Then use keyboard shortcut SHIFT COMMANDH and your text is highlighted in yellow.

I would like to use it to control another program (specifically Vox)\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this possible?\n\n*Is it possible without third-party software?\n\n\nA: It's possible, but not without third-party software or scripting.\nYou can use the Vox preference pane to set this though:\n\n(go to Vox → Preferences → Controls → Setup)\n", "Q: Add a custom icon to OS X folder This solution from Apple replaces the generic, blue folder with the specified graphic element.\nIs there a way to add a custom graphic 'over lay' to the generic, blue folder?  Dropbox is an example of this.\n** edit **\nI want to do this for one folder.  An alias to the folder should retain the icon as well.\nI would prefer to do this without the help of a 3rd-party application.\n\nA: The simplest way of doing it is just making it yourself.

For pasting it you'll have to click on the actual image, instead of Preview's selecting panel. \n\n*Now, either after clicking in the preview's panel or the actual image, do Edition / Copy.\n\n*Select the folder you want to change and do the Get info thing as you did before.\n\n*Select the folder's image at the top of the info window and paste the new icon by doing Edition / Paste.\n\n\nThis is the final result: \nIt's quite nasty, from a designer's point of view, but it will definitely do the trick.\n\nA: You can do this with Folders Factory:\n\nContacts might not be the best image for this, but you get the point.\nYou can also just overlay an image, or stamp a texture or text, but based on the Dropbox I guess this is what you're going for.\n", "Q: Is it possible to airdrop a video/photo to another ios device while playing it using airplay? I have some photo on my Ipad and i am showing them to my friend, using airplay, can i airdrop that specific video /photo to her ios device without stopping airplay?\n\nA: It depends on the app and how many copies of the document in question you have on the device. I can't think of an app that does both at the same time, but the plumbing is there as long as the app doing the AirDrop doesn't try to play the media before you send it.\n\nI can easily enable airplay and use the music player app to play music. While the music is playing, I can airdrop pictures from the Photos app with both happening simultaneously. So nothing on iOS prevents both from being active in general.\nIn fact, I can run any other app I want while AirPlay is going on with one catch. Only one source of media can play at one time. Specifically, things that the control center can play or pause or change volume is \"media\"\nIf the foreground app attempts to play sounds or video, that playing will automatically pause the music app from playing in the background but not affect the AirPlay settings. Since iOS handles muting the background sounds or video when another app requests play permission in the foreground it will pause the any multitask operation that was previously playing media.\n", "Q: Why the iPhone doesn't automatically switch 3G off when connected to a wireless network? This doesn't make any sense to me: why the iPhone doesn't automatically switch 3G off when connected to a wireless network?\nI always thought iPhone did that since the very beginning and my battery lasted 4–6 hours on average per day. (I can almost swear that I remember Steve Jobs himself telling that in the stage back then)\nThen a friend of mine asked me why I don't switch off the 3G when I am in the office to save some battery instead of charging it at my desk so in case I had to get out it was fully charged back again.\nSo, I tried... Boy, it was a huge difference! My iPhone's battery will last 10–13 hours on average. That means usually I can get back home from work and have my phone still working in my pocket.\nAny ideas?\nEDIT: my question is about worse battery performance when 3G is enabled. (Even though not supposed to be used) And I believe this isn't related to me, but to any iPhone user really.\n\nA: Although your iPhone will use WiFi when available, that's only to save your cellular data limit being reached as quickly. Your iPhone keeps the 3G antennas active (while the internet is in use) for the following reasons;\n\n\n*\n\n*In case you have 'flaky' WiFi; your iPhone will switch between WiFi and cellular without you noticing to keep a reliable connection working source*\n\n*In case you leave WiFi range; your iPhone can then immediately switch to cellular and use it right away without any delays.\n\n*In case your WiFi network doesn't have a 'proper' internet connection; if your WiFi network can't load certain pages (either because it's configured incorrectly, or because of a fault/security settings) your iPhone will use cellular to load those pages if possible. **\n\n\nSo, to answer your question, the iPhone keeps your 3G connection live while the phone is using the internet in some way so you can have a reliable connection. Your phone will only turn it off automatically when/if the phone is trying to save power.\n*I believe the toggle to enable/disable this feature has been removed, but the feature still exists (and remains always on).\n**I've seen this happen with those WiFi networks which would make you fill in a form/login before using the connection. The phone would be connected to WiFi, but apps would be using 3G to load new content as I was not yet logged in\n\nA: The iPhone will switch from 3g to a known wifi network, that is, one that it has connected to before. At your office go to settings > wifi and connect to your wifi network. From then on it should automatically connect when you are in range. If the phone doesn't remember the network, connect to iTunes, backup and restore.\nAlso, if you have a weak or intermittent 3g signal the phone will use a lot of power searching for and trying to connect to the network. I have this problem every time I visit my friends in the mountains. If you have a good wifi and 3g signal then your problem may be hardware or software related. If you're near an Apple store they can test the hardware for you.\n\nA: Such a feature was never a part of iOS. If you want to request it from Apple, use the contact details on the Apple website.\n\nA: Most of people are using 3 or 4 g with public connection (wifi) on.This will never work .This might create issues , a slow connection , beside this, when they can not be switched manually , the battery is twice weaker or more. \n\nA: As of iOS 9 there’s an option to disable “Wi-Fi Assist” that will effectively disable cellular data usage when connected to a Wi-Fi (or rather when disabled won’t automatically use cellular data to assist poor Wi-Fi connectivity.)\nFollow: Settings.app > Cellular > (at the very bottom) Wi-Fi Assist toggle:\n\n", "Q: How to open iPhone 5c locked with an iCloud account? I bought an iPhone 5c from a guy in a bar. He said he was going to remove the device from his iCloud list, which he never did and it's been 3 weeks already. The phone is not blacklisted and I know the phone is not stolen.\nHow can I start using the phone and is there a way for me to remove the device from the other guy's iCloud account?\n\nA: As other posts have mentioned - there is no known workaround to the lock and you will not be able to use that device until the account holding it locked releases the hold.\nHowever, knowing that it's not stolen and having gotten the seller's word that they will unlock it - you do have a little leverage over the seller. You can identify them and hopefully you have some idea of their contact information.\nTheir Apple ID is likely their email address, so have you tried mustering as much kindness and sending a polite email reminding them how you are eager to make use of the phone they sold you. See if the phone will show you their Apple ID - unfortunately for you (and fortunately for people who have their phone stolen) - on most screens you can't get to the full text of the Apple ID without knowing the passcode.\nIf you've exhausted the gentle ways, you could try checking with a local lawyer to see if they in any way violated local laws for sale of goods under a false description. Your costs for a quick consult and how to take them to small claims court might result in eventual repayment of your costs and the purchase price.\nThe local police might also be able to think of ways to convince the seller to do the correct thing at this point.\nIt's hard to say, but you are really at the seller's mercy if you hand over money before verifying the phone is really unlocked and free of their hold. For others, this article has the steps Apple recommends before buying a used phone.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5818\nYou could try appealing to them, but I would start locally rather than try to get Apple to break into someone's phone when they don't really know you or the seller.\n", "Q: Is there a way to add separators to sidebar?

I've deleted a system file from my Mac and need to get it back.\nSystem files can include:\n\n\n*\n\n*hidden files in the root of / - especially unix files in /private \n\n*/System files\n\n*/Library files\n\n*/Applications files that ship with the core OS\n\n\nSystem files are not any app, user files or files that can be regenerated by a known sequence such as cache files, Spotlight index files, etc…\n\nCanonical question and answer for this comment by bmike♦.\n\nA: There is a a solution that requires an Internet connection.\nOS X Recovery\nMac models introduced after Mac OS X 10.7, Lion, include the ability to start up directly from an Internet-based version of the OS X Recovery system.\nOS X automatically uses this feature when the Recovery System on the hard disk isn't available (such as when your hard disk encounters an issue, or when your hard disk has been replaced or erased). OS X Internet Recovery lets you start your Mac directly from Apple's servers. Starting up from this system performs a quick test of your memory and hard drive to check for hardware issues.\nSo I suggest you plug in your ethernet cable, since the wifi is probably not going to work, and choose the option to boot from the internet if the list of options come up and you've got the right version.\nRestoring iLife applications after Internet Restore of OS X\nIf your computer came with OS X Lion or later and you erase your hard disk and install OS X, you can download iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand from the Mac App Store. \n\n\n*\n\n*After installation, start (up) from OS X.\n\n*Double-click the App Store icon in the dock.\n\n*Enter your Apple ID and password.\n\n*Click Purchases.\nIf you haven't previously accepted your bundled iLife applications within the Mac App Store, you should see your iLife applications appear in the Accept portion of the screen.\n\n*Click Accept.\nYou may be asked for your Apple ID and password once again. Your iLife applications now move to the Purchased section. These applications are part of the software that came with your computer. Your account will not be charged for them.\n\n*Click Install to complete installation of your applications.\n\nA: Apple's Official answer would be to reinstall your system since accession system files from Time Machine can be risky and tricky. \n\n\n*\n\n*The system might be missing a file needed to assist in the recovery process and undefined / unpredictable results need more of an expert at the helm than using Time Machine to restore a photo or an app. \n\n*System files can be hidden and you'll need to know how to navigate to those folders by command shortcut as you restore the files from your Time Machine backup.\n\n*System files can have special permissions so you may need to fix them after restoring. \n\n*You may need to reboot after restoring and if you restore improperly, the system may fail to boot again. \n\n*Restoring from an old backup could undo patches or security updates and make your system harder to update. Having a recent backup can eliminate this potential problem. \n\n\n\nNow ha the risks are on the table, here is how to proceed. If you use Time Machine, connect to your backup disk, then open Finder window open to where the missing file was last seen. You may need to use Command-Shift-G to go to system folders - if so, just be prepared to use that shortcut once you enter Time Machine as it has a habit to show a user folder when it starts.\nUse the Time Machine menu in the menu bar select Enter Time Machine. Navigate back to a date the file existed, select the file, then click Restore (lower right button). \nIt will copy the file or folder back into your running system. At this point, make a backup and consider rebooting to allow the system to notice that the missing files are now restored.\n\nA: Copy the file from another system or a trusted1 person's machine\nIf you have a second machine with a comparable build of OS X installed on it, you can copy the file from it. Make sure that you haven't made changes to the file that you're copying if you want a fresh copy. This is especially important for copying files from someone else's machine as the changes may not be desirable.\nFeel free to ask for the checksum of a file in chat (don't forget to give an OS X version) to compare it to if you wish to make sure that the file has not been modified accidentally (or purposefully).\nDon't forget to do a permissions repair after copying the file over to make sure that the permissions have been set correctly on the file.\n1 It's probably not best to trust random strangers on the internet for crucial system files.\n\nA: Pacifist with OS X install media\nIf you've got an OS X install media and Pacifist, you can browse the install media and grab the file.\n\nIf you have Pacifist but no install media, it will prompt you to download the installer.\n\n\nA: If you have a recent Mac then it has a recovery partition.\nPower on your Mac and hold down Command+R until the Apple logo appears. This will cause your Mac to boot using the recovery partition.\nOnce you are in the recovery partition, you can then reinstall the operating system.\nThis Apple technical note, OS X: About OS X Recovery, gives more details.\nYou can reinstall the OS and leave your files intact. Apple removed the erase/install option so you don't have to worry about the Recovery Installer erasing your files. You now have to explicitly launch the Disk Utility tool to erase or reformat/repartition a drive when booted from recovery OS.\n\nA: If you don't mind or are sure your Recovery HD is patched to match the OS on your main system, you can snag a file and see if it works without needing to do a full reinstall of the OS and without needing a restart or an internet connection / saved installer.\nUse the Recovery partition\nMany1 system files are also included on the Recovery partition and can be copied over.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the Recovery HD\ndiskutil mount Recovery\\ HD\n\n\n*Mount the BaseSystem.dmg\nhdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg\n\n\n*Copy the file\nFILE=\"/usr/bin/codesign\"\nsudo cp -p /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System/${FILE} ${FILE}\n\nThis process can be combined into a single-line command if you have to run it frequently…\nFILE=\"/usr/bin/codesign\"; diskutil mount Recovery\\ HD && hdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg && sudo cp -p /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System/${FILE} ${FILE}\n\nEven if you have deleted the cp binary (which could happen), there is /usr/bin/ditto, /usr/bin/tar and several other commands that can stand in for cp.\nReinstall OS X\nIf you've got the ability to reinstall OS X through the Recovery HD, Internet Recovery or an OS X install media then reinstalling OS X will 'repair' your install and copy any missing/broken system files back to your system.\n\nI recommend that you do a permissions repair using Disk Utility after copying a file manually and then rebooting. If the fix works, now would be an excellent time for another backup snapshot.\n1 Not all system files are on the Recovery HD, but many are. If the copying command doesn't work, check that the file exists on the Recovery HD.\n\nA: If you are sure your Recovery HD is patched to match the OS on your main system, you can snag a file and see if it works without needing to do a full reinstall of the OS.\nHold ⌘-R during startup until you see a window similar to this:\n\nThese are your options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Utilities>Terminal:\n\nYour OS X disk will be mounted in /Volumes/<your disk name>.

In System Preferences > Mouse there's a setting \"Scroll direction: natural\", which I don't like, so I unset.  The problem is that this also unsets the setting for Trackpad, which I do like.  \nHow can you have different settings for mouse and trackpad?\n(In case you can't understand the rationale for wanting them different, and think this is a ridiculous question, here is the reasoning.  Mice have had scroll wheels for decades, and the direction of the wheel turning has always been in sync with the motion of the scrollbar.  This is, in my opinion, the most natural way to do things, even though it is the opposite of what Apple calls \"natural\".  On the other hand, I'm perfectly willing to use Apple's \"natural\" scrolling for trackpads, because the metaphor here is that you're moving your fingers across a page, just as if you were using an iOS device's touchscreen.  The idea that Apple treats these as the same thing, when they are conceptually completely different is very odd to me.  I don't want to change a decades-old habit with the mouse, just because Apple changed their idea of how a trackpad should work.  I embrace the trackpad change because it makes sense to anyone who uses an iPhone or iPad (and I use both) but I'm not willing to rewire my brain's way of using the mouse.)\n\nA: Update 2020/12/03: As other's have pointed out, this is not a feature of Karabiner in newer versions.\n\nIt appears that this is integrated in the Karabiner app so it works out of the box without any custom XML (which are described above).\nYou'll need the following settings:\n\n*\n\n*Karabiner Preferences > Change Key > Karabiner core settings > Exclude devices > Don't remap Apple's pointing devices\n\n*Karabiner Preferences > Change Key > Pointing Device > Reverse scrolling direction > Reverse Vertical Scrolling\n\nSet the Enable Natural Scrolling setting in the Mouse/TrackPad PrefPane to 'enabled'. This allows for the internal trackpad to work as it's supposed to.

To edit the two suggested settings, do the following:\nChange Key tab > Exclude Devices > Select \"Don't remap Apple's pointing keyboards\nChange Key tab > Pointing Device > Reverse Scrolling Direction Select \"Reverse Vertical Scrolling\"\nFrom here, use Apple > System Preferences > Mouse (or touchpad) and select \"natural scrolling\" \n\nA: I found myself in the exact same boat (preferring Natural for TrackPad and normal for Mouse), and in case anyone attempts to do the same, I did file a bug report against Apple for this. They closed it rather briefly with the words \"This is intentional\" and no other explanation. \nI'm guessing that it's a common request, and they're just tired of hearing it.\n\nA: Based on Tien answer, I tried to find some Logitech software that could help me. I have a Anywhere MX 2 mouse and the Logitech Options software really \"fix\" this problem for me! It can be downloaded here:\nhttps://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options\nHere is how I set it:\n\nHaving scroll direction: standard here and natural scrolling on macOS Sierra settings make it work as it makes sense: natural scrolling on trackpad (two thingers up scrolls down) and standard scrolling on the wheel (roll the wheel \"back\" scrolls down).\nHope it helps!\n\nA: I had the same problem when I started to use macOS.\nI installed this little utility, which lets you reverse the scrolling behavior only for the mouse:\nScroll Reverser for macOS\n\nA: I made a free application to solve this issue in recent versions of macOS (10.15+).

Before I cover it up with the new piece of glass, I'd like to try to at least reduce the visibility of that scratch, if not repair it.  Is there anything that will work on the LCD screen itself (all the tips I've come across are for the glass)?\n\nA: You have no good options for repair. \nAny mechanical stress you add could sabotage the panel later making it more likely to crack. Any coating you try has worse side effects as it ages. \nI would make a judgement call based on the location of the scratch, the depth of the scratch and your temperament. If you can live with it, just continue with the repair. \nIf you know it will drive you nuts or is on a part of the screen you look at often, bite the bullet and buy a new LCD panel. Sell the scratched one to someone that isn't as picky (you probably know several people that use a phone with broken glass for months and maybe someone that even uses one with chunks of the digitizer missing). You could probably charge someone your costs for the panel to repair their Mac and come out of it even. \n\nA: Now i don't think you can fix that, but here's what you can do : Go to a computer repair shop and tell them what happened. They will maybe order you a LCD Screen or there's one option.

My MacBook Pro (2011) is not up to date, however there are no software updates showing. I know it is not up to date because when I try downloading Xcode it says Xcode can's be installed on Macintosh HD, it needs Mac OS X 10.8.4.What should I do?\n\nA: For OS updates, the software updater only shows minor releases (so if you are running 10.6, you'll get all the 10.6.x updates etc.). In your case you need to upgrade to a more recent major release (10.8 or 10.9).\nI would suggest going into the Mac App Store and examining the new OS X Apple release called Mavericks. It is 10.9 and might have several features of interest to you. Before purchasing and installing it though please backup your computer and files (perhaps via Time Machine).\nWith 10.9 installed you can run the lastest version of Xcode but be aware, I don't know what other programs you have on your system and it could be that older apps and app versions might not support 10.9 at the moment or without further updating ($$$).\n\nA: I would grab the 10.8.5 Combo update package from Apple's downloads page.

If I'm using an application on my secondary display, and I use spotlight to open a new application, I want it to open on my primary display, not the display that was just active.  Unfortunately, the only way that I know of to fix this is to disable separate spaces for each display, which I use very frequently.  Is there any way that I can force all of my applications to open on the primary display (the one with the menu bar in the Displays preference pane)?\n\nA: I don't fully understand your question but here's my answer on what i think you want to achieve.

If I shut down the machine and switch it on then everything is OK, but on restart it can not detect the SSD and shows the flashing folder!\njust on restart\nHow can I fix the problem?\n\nA: Two possible causes for your troubles as I see it with the information provided is that either the bless command for the SSD is corrupted or your NVRAM is corrupted.\nHave you tried reseting the NVRAM/PRAM? This is done by holding down opt + cmd + p + r right after you power the Mac. Hold these four keys down until you hear the boot chime for the third time after which you can let go and your system will have cleared out what it boots to by default. \nThat is only the first portion of the fix because it will boot quicker now (or should) but you need to tell your system to boot to the SSD. Go into System Preferences and then Startup Disk as Kent suggest and highlight the SSD. At this point I even go far enough to tell Startup Disk to restart... This will test it immediately and you can let us now if that resolved the troubles you are having.\nIf not then you might have a damaged OS or some corrupted settings that are making your restarts unclean.

But I keep running into an inability to type e.g. ō without switching (using the mouse) to U.S. Extended.\nMy search skills both on Google and on this site have yielded no ways of typing the ¯ character anywhere within Kotoeri. Has the entire Internet missed this, or am I just so stupid that everyone's figured it out and it wasn't even complicated enough to warrant how-to articles? Or is it impossible?\n\nA: While reading your question, I happened to stumble upon the (imho) easiest option:\nSimply uncheck the \"Romaji\" checkbox under Input modes in your Japanese/Kotoeri pane in the System Preferences. Then you can choose an easy keyboard shortcut for switching exclusively between U.S.Extended (with the āēīōū capability) and the Hiragana Japanese mode.\nSince I use a Japanese Apple Keyboard which includes the 英数 (Romaji) and かな (Kana) keys next to the space bar, this is ideal for me, but you could just use any other shortcut as well.\n\nA: I am sure you have discovered this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Macrons\nI too use the Romaji keyboard layout for several reasons and I have overcome this by using substitution I will add a different accent mark (eg. òóöôõ) and then later to do a Find and Replace to insert ō. \nThis seems impossible from all of my attempts through 10.4-10.9 Wish I had better news. Additionally you might feel the desire to request this feature, join me in asking them @ http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html I suggested using alt/option and then - followed by the letter for macron so in this case opt + - then o.\nCheers!\n\nA: In 10.7 i've been able to create a custom US (Roman) keyboard layout with Ukelele that replaces a normal unused character with o-macron.  I could select this layout in Kotoeri Preferences/Operation/Romaji keyboard layout and then type o-macron when in Kotoeri Romaji mode.\nAnother possibility is to enter o-macron as a dictionary entry for some Hiragana input. It will then appear as one of the choices for Kanji selection.  But this requires switching away from Romaji.\nThe text substitution feature of the OS or the app could also be used to convert some character combo to o-macron.  But normally this requires typing an extra space which may need to be deleted.\n", "Q: What would be a good SSD drive for a MacBook Pro mid 2010?

Should I take that into account for something?\nI believe I shouldn't experiment any problem with this change of hard drive and will improve the laptop performance as well as the hard drive life. Am I wrong?\nI'm afraid of the possibility of having problems with it for compatibility issues or any other thing.\nThanks!\n\nA: I recommend the Crucial M500 SSDs. They're solid, reliable, and fast. I've replaced the OEM HDD on both my 2008 aluminum MacBook and 2011 MacBook Pro with them and have had 0 issues so far, they work great. Below are some links for your perusal.\nBuy them on Amazon\nManufacturer Information\n\nA: I put an Intel 330 series SSD in my mid-2010 MBP. The performance difference (compared to stock 500GB HDD) was amazing.\nIt worked for me, and it's TRIM compatible but you need to use TRIM Enabler or similar to turn it on.\nPersonally I looked around for info on the most reliable SSDs rather than the fastest. I found people saying they'd successfully used the Intels (and well most brands actually). I also found some vendors saying that (at the time) the Intel 330s were seeing less RAs than some other similarly priced brands I was looking at; this may or may not be the case right now, and I was only able to compare a few brands. For me, the top-end drive speed difference didn't mean all that much, because primarily I was after the low seek speeds.\nSure it was nice having ~400MB/s+ (not sure what speed it actually ran at) but I didn't do a lot of work that truly utilised the top-speed of the SSD, so the performance differences were pretty moot. And unless you're doing some heavy video editing or really disk-heavy work, I'd suggest the performance differences won't be noticed.\nOne final point, if using a data-doubler or similar (i.e. replacing the DVD drive with a second disk) bear in mind that the two SATA ports are of different speeds in the mid-2010 MBP. The primary (HDD) SATA port is SATA3 (6Gbps ~ 700 MB/sec ish) while the secondary (optical drive's) port is SATA2 (3Gbps ~ 350MB/sec ish) so you definitely want to put any SSD in the primary SATA port where the main HDD is/was.\n", "Q: Does Exist any way to change battery of MBP 2012 13\" with a bigger one?

I have had too much experience with bad batteries, lies, and incompatible products. My customers will come in with batteries from those places and they burnt out within a week or never worked to begin with. \nIf you battery is truly defective or has issues then an AASP can run a quick test, usually before they even check the unit into their system, and see how healthy the battery is and then if it is defective order you a new one.

New files can be created as long as there is free disk space.\nThe compatibility layer that emulates the i-node behaviour always reports a percentage of used i-nodes equal to or slightly less than the percentage of used space.\n\nA: Well this isn't just about how many file and folders you have but now large directories are. There are some really cool apps for finding out where your space went. \nTry: http://www.daisydiskapp.com\nIf you want to get rid of files that can take up space and won't really affect your files check out this guy: http://www.titanium.free.fr/downloadonyx.php\nAdditionally something that might help once you have a bit more space, you can force Spotlight to rebuild it's index, you can disable Time Machine's mobile backups and if you are like me you can even prevent the OS from creating a image of your RAM in the event your system looses power. Add a comment if you are interested in these and I will be happy to give more information.\n\nA: It isn't clear what the problem was that prompted this old question, but as a direct answer, the command listed at https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/inode-last-summer/ will give a list of inode usage for each subdirectory tree rooted in the current directory.\nNote that the command format used for find does not work with the version of find shipped with macOS. This can be addressed either by substituting with gfind (installed via Homebrew) or by passing . as the first parameter to find. ie. Either of these commands should work:\n\necho \"Detailed Inode usage for: $(pwd)\" ; for d in `gfind -maxdepth 1\n-type d |cut -d/ -f2 |grep -xv . |sort`; do c=$(find $d |wc -l) ; printf \"$c\\t\\t- $d\\n\" ; done ; printf \"Total: \\t\\t$(find $(pwd) | wc\n-l)\\n\"\n\n\necho \"Detailed Inode usage for: $(pwd)\" ; for d in `find . -maxdepth 1\n-type d |cut -d/ -f2 |grep -xv . |sort`; do c=$(find $d |wc -l) ; printf \"$c\\t\\t- $d\\n\" ; done ; printf \"Total: \\t\\t$(find $(pwd) | wc\n-l)\\n\"\n\nNOTE that neither of these commands correctly account for directory names containing spaces, so if you need to get the results for such subdirectories you will need to run the command once inside each such subdirectory.\n", "Q: How to connect USB hardware to a MBP via an external monitor I have a setup where I am using one external monitor (Dell P2414H) for two laptops - one Macbook Pro and one Dell Latitude E6430. \nThe dell is connected via a docking station with VGA cable, and I am able to use the USB keyboard and mouse when they are plugged in to the monitor. \nThe Macbook Pro is connected directly to the monitor using a DVI cable and the Mini DisplayPort / DVI adaptor. \nHowever, my MBP doesn't seem to see the external keyboard and mouse unless I unplug them from the monitor and plug them directly into the laptop.\nI need to switch between both laptops very frequently, so replugging is not a good option.\nHow can I make my MBP see the mouse and keyboard when they are plugged into the monitor?\n\nA: I think your problem is that USB is not carried over Display Port/DVI. I have an older Apple Cinema Display that has USB ports on it and the cable has both DVI and USB ends that get plugged into the Mac. \nThat DELL monitor has an upstream USB port (and I would be very surprised if that is not connected to your docking station for the PC). Connect a cable between that and the Mac and the keyboard and mouse should work. \n", "Q: White screen problem in iphone 3gs Hello i have iPhone 3 gs and i have amazing problem when i lock my phone then after 15-20 seconds its shows white screen then i have to restart it what to do in this case is this a battery problem ? but if so then it does not switched off when i have connected to charger \nI already have tried to reset it but not working..............\nSo, is white iphone 3gs all white or only the back of the phone is white?\n\nA: The iPhone 3 and iPhone 3GS era hardware show an all white screen most often when the hardware is damaged and needs a repair. When the devices were new, liquid corrosion and damage were the likely cause, but as these age it also could be a routine failure and not have anything to do with water. \n\n\n*\n\n*back it up (a successful backup means you might seek a screen replacement estimate)\n\n*attempt to restore from iTunes\n\n*recycle or repair or replace\n\n", "Q: Alternative to multitouch in Mavericks I am using OSX Mavericks on latest Mackbook Pro Retina.\nAfter a week of intensive usage I have got some pain in my fingers because of the multi-fingers scrolling (two to scroll pages, three to switch between screens).\nHow can I scroll in applications without using 2 fingers-scroll? I know I can press 'Fn+Up/Down' in web-browsers, but how to scroll in Finder, Terminal, etc.? \nIs there also any way to switch between virtual screens without using three-fingers?\nPS: when scrolling using multi-touch, one has to keep 2 fingers floating over the surface of the trackpad - this after some time leads to the pain. On iPad it doesn't happen because its position is usually not vertical (when you keep it in another hand).\n\nA: You can switch between screens using the Ctrl+Right/Left Arrow shortcuts (by default, this can be of course modified in the Keyboard Shortcuts settings).\nYou can scroll in the terminal using Shift+PgUp/PgDn keys. On MacBooks you will need to press Shift+Fn+Up/Down Arrow.\nFn+Up/Down also works in Finder.\n\nA: In some programs (e.g. Safari) you can use Alt+Up/Down to scroll up and down. I find it more convenient since it only requires one hand.\nIn Finder this shortcut seems to jump from top to bottom.\n\nA: I had similar issues and found Apple's magic mouse helped a lot. You can still use almost all of Maverick's gestures but I find its much easier and more comfortable. Try it out. If it doesn't help you can return it for a refund.

Loading the email into a browser fetches the link.  By keying the link to the web page to the user's email address, you can track who opened it.\nSo you set up your web server so that it has a virtual host with a rewrite rule that rewrites every request to a single 1 bit GIF file.

I don't mean to just save the space by deleting it from the applications folder, but to delete all the files that it uses to make it run. I don't worry about the files it produces.\n\nA: There are several 3rd-party “un-installers” available for Mac. The one I use is AppZapper.\nThere may be files in \"~/Library/Application Support/{folder name of app}\" and there may be a preference file in ~/Library/Preferences/.\nSandboxed apps have their data in \"~/Library/Containers/{folder name of company}\"\nSome applications may also install more complicated things like kexts. Most of those apps will have their own uninstallers.\n\nA: Deleting the application from the Applications folder is deleting the application.  Some will store further data in ~/Library/Application\\ Support/.\n\nA: Well known you can go ahead and download \"AppCleaner\". Find it here : http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/ [Supports OS X 10.6 - 10.9 Currently]\n\nHere's another way to delete some apps.\nWhen you install a application, many of them will come when you click \"Launchpad\" To delete a app try doing this : \n1 : Click Launchpad\n\n2 : Click and hold the app you want to delete [ NEXT CLICK ON THAT X LITTLE BUTTON TO DELETE YOUR APP ]\n\n\nA: I ask your question before.

I have a late 2013 MBA which only has USB 3 ports and one Thunderbolt port. I've currently been using a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter to use wired internet, but I'd also like to use an external monitor at the same time. Are there any USB to HDMI or USB to Ethernet (provided that the internet speed won't be decreased) adapters which I could use?\nThanks\n\nA: Apple sells an USB Ethernet adapter. But since it's USB 2 it's likely to speed down the network capabilities. \nThere are other adapters with USB3 which seems to be faster (and compatible with OSX) . \n", "Q: Create Wireless Bridge Connection Between Modem & WNDR3700 Router My ADSL modem is in one room and my Computer (Mac) and Router is in the other. I'd like  the Router to connect to the Modem wirelessly to access Internet.\nI've enabled Bridging in the Modem and I'm able to connect to the internet via an ethernet cable after setting up a PPPoE connection (with ISP settings) and connecting directly to my Mac. However, when I try and unplug the cable and even after entering the Internet access settings (username and password) in the Router I'm unable to connect to the Internet wirelessly.\nIm using a Netgear WNDR3700 Router and a Technicolor TG582n Modem. My Mac is running OS X Mavericks.\nI'm not sure where I'm going wrong!\n\nA: Nothing is going wrong, this is expected behavior.  You are disconnecting the path used by the router to connect to the modem.  The short answer is, you can not do this this way.  The router needs to be physically connected to the modem if the modem is bridging.\nThe long answer includes explanations that have to do with the Data Link Layer versus the Networking layer and using the router as a wired to wireless bridge...\nIf the modem has built in wireless capability you could turn everything on in it.  I do not know if your router will act as a wired to wireless bridge (backwards from the usual).  This would require special configuration that is not what is usually expected.\n", "Q: iPhone contacts not syncing with Gmail or Windows anymore I have an iPhone 4s with iOS 7.0.3.\nI am trying to sync my iPhone contacts somewhere safe, besides the backup in iTunes. I was burned in the past with iTunes backup when contacts all got lost on my phone and the backup deleted the contacts as well.\nI am trying to avoid iCloud because I want to be able to easily extract the content as a flat file.  \nI used to have iTunes sync my iPhone contacts to Gmail.  But suddenly, iTunes no longer gives me an option for sync with Gmail - it only gives me an option to sync contacts to Windows Contacts.\nWindows contacts would be ok too - except this also doesn't work anymore.

I'd like to maintain a list a signatures (e.g. with different quotes, etc) and swap them randomly or every such-and-such minutes.\nI'm using different email apps for different accounts so something that would simply change the signature text file that's then loaded in to Thunderbird, Mail, etc. would be great.\n\nA: About the only luck I've had, other than writing scripts myself, is using SignatureProfiler.  Note that it's not free ($12).\nIt's mostly overkill for what I need, which is just the random signatures, so I've implemented a few little scripts to get this working on my own machine - Random Signatures for OSX\nNote, however, that something seems to have changed in 10.10 that is now preventing Mail from updating the signature when the signature file itself is updated (until I manually trigger it, or restart mail).  They must have some kind of caching in mail now for the sig files so that it's not read in every time.\n\nA: Try 'ThunderWiz' on the Mac App Store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thunderwiz/id1350413811?ls=1&mt=12\n(also cheaper than the app mentioned above)\n", "Q: Can I Reinstall iBooks?

It has no monitor connected.  I use Remote Desktop on my laptop (also running Mavericks) for I/O to my server.\nWhen I use Remote Desktop and go Full Screen I get a 1280x1024 screen sitting in my 1680x1050 screen.  Is there any way to force the client (Mac Mini) to use a setting of 1680x1050 so I get a real full screen?\nI tried holding down the option key while clicking on Scaled in Display -> System preferences.  All I see is a new button in the bottom right that says detect displays.  Clicking on it does nothing.  The only resolution shown is 1280x1024.\nMy Mac Mini Server is a late 2009 with an Nvidia GeForce 9400 graphics card.\n\nA: Many people seem to have good luck using the AirDisplay drivers to achieve this. There's also headless dummy adapters you can buy, although that might be overkill. If you're keen to building your own there's a way to do that as well.\nMore information here.\n\nA: I'd like to offer an improved answer, that the author may consider for the question. The previous answer's AirDisplay drivers actually messed up my remote client, and left me with 16 virtual displays, all with the same information, where I couldn't click anything. Luckily I know how to navigate Activity Monitor with the Keyboard :-) . \nI found the following to work perfectly, assuming that you are using Apple Remote Desktop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Display Menu (Free on Mac App Store)\n\n*Install the app, and for my use cases, 1680x1050 was the proper resolution.\n\n*Your screen will go black and you will be 'locked out', despite the resolution properly switching.\n\n*Your screen will black out. Many recommend something similar to the following Terminal commands. I DO NOT recommend the following:\n\nsudo ps auxwww | grep loginwindow | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' |\n  xargs sudo kill -9\n\n\n*The reason the last line does not work is because it actually terminates your login session. That forces the screen resolution to revert (in my case, back to 1280x1020), and you'll be back where you started.\n\n*Instead, use the following command over Apple Remote Desktop or via SSH: \n\nkillall ScreensharingAgent\n\n\n*NOTE - if using Apple Remote Desktop's Send Unix Command, instead of using sudo, click the radio button to 'Run as User', and just enter root.\nThis command terminates the Screen Sharing session, which at its core is what Apple Remote Desktop uses. It retains the logged in session, which retains the screen resolution you set with Display Menu in earlier steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*2nd Note - if your dock is screwed up, simply send killall dock\nI have yet to log out of my current session on my client machine, so this may only be a temporary fix. However, its the only way I have found that satisfies my OCD with proper screen real estate consumption.\nSome things that helped me find this answer: \n\n\n*\n\n*Alternative to this answer on SuperUser, doesn't accomplish what I wanted, but good to have for reference material\n\n*MacWorld Hints, which held the elusive answer!\n\n\nSome alternatives that others have presented below, in case this answer does not work for your system:\n\n\n*\n\n*QuickRes App\n\n*SwitchRexX\n\n*Resolutionator\n\nA: Simplest solution:\nJust hold the 'Option' key while you press on 'Scaled' button in the display settings in system preferences. This will bring up all available resolutions and you can change to whichever you like.\n\n\n\nA: Use cscreen from Brew. It's free and surprisingly easy.\nbrew install Caskroom/cask/cscreen\ncscreen -d 32 -x 1920 -y 1080 -r 60\n\n\nA: Just downloading Display menu from App Store (free) and choosing highest resolution worked for me on Yosemite. Now running headless with great remote screen resolution. No other actions required.\n\nA: Here's an alternative, based on CDD's answer that will work for Lion.  The Display Menu application doesn't work on Lion.\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences, Displays, and choose the resolution you want.  Switch to this resolution.  The VNC display will freeze.  Press Return a couple of times to accept the resolution anyway.  You'll see the menu bar getting wider for a moment, but not the VNC windows.  Then it'll auto-revert to how it was.\nThis step is necessary to allow this resolution to show up in the menu chooser in later steps.\n\n\n*Enable \"Show displays in menu bar\".\n\n\n*The display chooser may still not show up in the menu bar for lack of space.  To make space, go to Preferences, Users & Groups, Login Options and disable \"Show fast user switching menu\".  Disable anything you don't need in the menu bar until there's enough space for the display chooser to show up.\n\n\n*Close Preferences.  Log in to the same computer using ssh separately.  Choose the desired resolution from the menu bar display chooser, press return a couple of times, and now you can run killall ScreensharingAgent from the ssh session.  The VNC window will now resize to the correct resolution.\nThis convoluted method has worked for me.\n\nA: Beeing in lockdown and using a remote headless mac mini, I found a free working  utility from Mac App Store: EasyRes\nLink:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/app/easyres/id688211836\n\nA: SwitchResX worked for me.\nIt is a shareware utility that installs itself into System Preferences. From within the panel, it allows you to force the default resolution of an external monitor.\n\nA: For its simplicity, I prefer the QuickRes application.\n\nA: This Finally solved a similar annoying work-related monitor problem of mine. Might help you too. My development-work computer is an iMac sitting on my Baby Grand Piano. But for ergonomic reasons I prefer to work remotely from my old MacBook Pro 17” over home wifi to the iMac using Apple’s screen sharing app.\nWorks fine but theres a niggle. My MacBook screen res. is 1920 x 1200 but the iMac is 1920 x 1080 maximum native. So for remote work my screen real estate is squashed. I get to use only 1080 lines out of the 1200 available on my MacBook Pro, with black letter boxing above and below the video. A waste.\nTo my rescue comes a tiny product: fit-Headless by CompuLab for £21 - sold on Amazon. You plug it into the second monitor video port where it acts as a dummy second display with variable screen resolution options up to 4K.\nHowever on receiving it - I plugged it into my VDI port. It appeared in preferences as a second screen. BUT..... woe woe woe .. with all the options of screen res - going all the way up to 4K..... NO BLOODY 1920 x 1200 !!!! W T F !!!\nGoogled around. And came across and downloaded demo of an app called SwitchResX which does all manner of things to do with monitors. It too had tons of resolution options BUT STILL NO 1920 x 1200 !!. BUT..... hidden away was a tab where you can set up your own custom screen res. So added one for 1920x1200.\nAnd HEY PRESTO ! for an extra £18 for SwitchResX I can now work remotely on my iMac from my Macbook at the same high resolution as my macbook.\nNo letterboxing. More pixels to poke, drag and mouse around with..\nHAPPY DAYS !\n[ PS: these fit-Headless adapters are actually intended for people using Mac Mini’s as “headless” servers etc where they administer them remotely and don’t want to have an actual monitor attached. For example because it sits in a rack or on a shelf... ]\n\nA: Resolutionator worked for me on El Capitan.\n\nA: Display menu from App Store (free) worked for me too, running OS X 10.10, Yosemite.\nI wonder is there a way to force it through command line / conf files. For now Display menu is the way to go for a Mac headless computer.\n\nA: At first, just Option+clicking in System Preferences > Displays between \"Default for Display\" and \"Scaled\" only brought up 1280x1024 and 1280x720 for me.\nHowever, after I changed the Apple Screen Sharing app's preference under Display from \"Scale to fit available space\" to \"Show in full size\", then 1920x1080 and a whole range of other options came up.\nThis was valuable to me because I was looking to avoid any apps requiring SIP to be disabled and any apps only available through the App Store. I don't have enough rep to comment on one of the more upvoted posts referencing a screen shot of using the above method on a Macbook but hope this helps someone!\n", "Q: Show Results of Automator-Terminal command TL;DR If I create a .app via Automator, how can I show results of a shell script in a dialog or terminal window?\nI am using Automator to run a shell script \nadb install /Directory/$1.apk\n\nand if I run it via Automator, I can see the results (install successful or can't find filname.apk or whatever else terminal would tell me). If I save as app and double click to run, then I do not get to see these results.\nWhat can I do to show a dialog or terminal window that would display the results of the script I run?\n\nA: If you only have a few lines of output, you'd want to assign it to a variable and then display a confirmation dialog showing the output.\n\n\n*\n\n*add Action \"Set Value of Variable\"\n\n*enter a new variable, e.g. output\n\n*add Action \"Ask for Confirmation\"\n\n*in the message field, enter the variable name declared above.

As it came with iOS 4.x (I don't remember the exact version), the first time I connected it to my computer (Mac), iTunes offered to upgrade it to iOS 6.1.3.\nThis is the problem: it was jailbroken before the upgrade and it was working fine with my carrier (TIM). But after the upgrade, I'm not able to activate it.\nEven if I try to \"hacktivate\" and install ultrasn0w, it still doesn't recognise my SIM card.\nI've read somewhere that I should use an AT&T SIM card to activate it and then I should jailbreak and install ultrasn0w.\nAnd this is my question: Will this process work if I do it in Brazil? I mean: I'm planning to ask a friend to bring me an AT&T SIM card from USA. Would this work as expected? Or does the iPhone must be in USA for the activation?\n\nA: Yes - you just need any new or secondhand AT&T SIM to get the device activated. If you can keep that SIM to do the activation so much the better, so having a friend bring one would be easy if you can wait.\nThe process won't care where in the world you are, just that when the device connects to Apple's activation servers, the SIM number from the card is in an AT&T range. At that point, you'll need to do the jailbreak work appropriate for the device and the OS level but it will work as a WiFi based device with just the correct SIM and no AT&T contract required.\n", "Q: How to check if MacBook screen is genuine? I bought used MacBook Pro and have suspicion that screen was replaced and the replacement is not genuine. Is there a way to check that?\n\nA: In terminal.app you can paste this command to find out which display you're using:\nsystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType\n\nwhich should return all of your Graphics/Display information.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now the question is what is genuine? Apple and just about every other company uses parts from many different manufacturers at any given time. The only way to know is by identifying the exact model and serial number of your MacBook Pro and then determining which part was used in that particular batch.\n\n", "Q: How can I tell if a 30-pin USB cable for an iPhone is genuine? I have many of the 30-pin USB cables for the iPhone, and I would like to determine which are authentic Apple and which are not. (Over the three years that I owned an iPhone 4 and my wife an iPhone 4s, I purchased several \"knock-offs\"). Is there a good way to determine which cables are authentic and which cables are not?\n\nA: The cable itself will be stamped with the text: \"Designed by Apple in California Assembled in China\".  The \"knock offs\" wouldn't be allowed to stamp their cables in this way.Edit: It would be on the cable itself near the end that plugs into the iPhone (30-pin end).Edit: The photo shows the text I refer to.  This is an example of a genuine lightning connector in which they added a serial number for identification and moved the stamp about 8 inches down from the USB end of the cable.\n\nA: Take them into an Apple Store.\nNo, really. Fakes are most often low quality and look/feel cheap, but until you know what a legit cable is, look/feel are arbitrary things. And some fakes can sometimes look really really good.\nA(n Apple) Genius can no doubt sort this out quickly.\nNote also that there are at least 4 different type of legit first party 30-pin iOS device adapters that I know of. They changed the \"teeth\" that wedge into the dock connector port at least twice, and I believe there was even a cable material change or two.\nIIRC there have also been changes to the USB port end. Rounded corners vs. right-angle corners.\n\nA: Use the iTunes application on a computer and connect them to the computer.

I have unearthed an old working iBook G4 which I'd like to clean and then give away. I don't have a copy of 10.4 on hand to install. And I'm not terribly interested in wiping the installed applications off of it, more so I just want to make sure there's no application user data left on it.\nAt this point all I can think of is to just create a new user, and delete all trace of the existing user from /Users/. I personally have very little experience of 10.4 however, and only got involved in Mac since 10.6, so I'm concerned about things I might be missing.\n\nA: You can take your 10.6 knowledge and apply it down all the way to 10 as the big changes in user level data and file system changes arrived at 10.7 and later. \nThe easy way out, is boot the Mac in target disk mode and connect it via FireWire to any Mac and zero the drive, secure erase, etc... The recipient will likely be able to order a 10.4 replacement disk for less than $25 online and set up the OS as desired. \nAlso your plan to just make a shell user account and delete the old user accounts would work well for light protection. Better to copy movie files or other data over all the empty space then delete them to prevent a simple undelete from recovering files only deleted by the OS. \nMaybe examine the system keychain for any wireless passwords you don't want escaping, but most things of a sensitive nature are in the user home folder. \n\nA: If you have an external disk, let's name it bob to be clear.\n\n*\n\n*Clone your iBook G4 internal disk to bob with Carbon Copy Cloner, version 3.4.7.\nCheck that this copy is bootable.

Such as: Copy Crucial SSD Firmware Update ISO to Bootable USB\nI am trying to upgrade the firmware of my SSD (crucial m500) from my macbook pro (mid 2010). My DVD drive is broken and I cannot replace it because the exit of the DVD is broken too. (the DVDs cannot get out after inserting.)\nI found a lot of articles and followed them exactly, but none of them worked.\nThere are two typical methods I found.\n1) using terminal to make the USB stick.\nReference: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\nI am very sure I did it correctly. But when starting my mac, it did not recognize the usb stick.\n2) using natural osx applications to make the USB stick.\nReference: http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/how-to-create-a-bootable-usb-to-install-os-x/\nThis one is actually for making a USB installer for OSX. But I thought I would be quite similar to make a bootable USB stick for updating firmware. So I followed it, but disk utility did not allow me to restore the USB from the dmg file.\nThere are also a third method which uses rEFInd Boot Manager. So I do not actually need to make a mac specific bootable USB stick. But I had a bad experience messing around with rEFInd, and I do not want to take the risk again.\nSome people say the USB stick does not work because Apple disabled booting from USB functionality for security reasons. If that's the case my only solutions are using rEFInd or updating the firmware from some other computers? \nIs there anyone did it successfully? \n\nA: I can confirm that this process works:\nhttps://fuerstnet.de/en/upgrade-crucial-m4-ssd-firmware-mac-without-cd\nThere are many steps to follow, both in creating the usb disk, then in booting from it, but it took me to the firmware updater as promised. After all that effort, my disk was already up-to-date, but it did work. \nCrucial support says there is no option for people without a CD drive, but there is. You just have to be willing to carefully follow some instructions and be sure you're not writing to the wrong disk. \n\nA: I haven't tried this on a Crucial drive before (only OWC), but the method is the same; you should be able to use Disk Utility to restore the ISO file to a USB drive (try going directly from the ISO instead of converting to DMG). \nHere's something from the Crucial forums that outlines the process:\n\nI've just done the MU-03 firmware update for my M500 SSD's on a MacPro. It wasn't easy, but it does fix the slow boot time issue (at least for me).\nIf you've already downloaded the firmware update you should have a file called \ncrucial-m500-1.MU03.03.S0.iso\nUsing Disk Utility, burn this file onto a blank CD using the Restore option.\nPut this into your Mac drive and power down.  Power up holding the C key down, release it as soon as you get the Crucial black screen.  If a row of cccccc's appear, backspace delete them.  The Firmware upgrade should then automatically open.  Follow the instructions carefully (type yes when prompted and hit return ).  If you have more than one SSD, it completes the first then asks again if you want to update the second.\nOnce everything is complete, hold down the power button to reset the computer.  Power up as usual and if necessary re-select the SSD as boot drive from System Prefs.\n\nSources: http://forum.crucial.com/t5/Solid-State-Drives-SSD/Mac-Mini-and-M500-Firmware-upgrade/td-p/135873\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht2087\n\nA: If you have access to a Windows PC (inside a virtual machine or real) you can use Universal USB Installer to copy the ISO to an USB stick according to the instructions available on Crucial's website.\nThis stick will boot fine and update your mac SSD. It worked for my Macbook Pro with a MX100 ssd.\nAt least you don't need to remove the disk from the mac to do it this way. \n", "Q: When changing email address associated with Apple ID, does this create new imessage account? So I have a few people I'd prefer not to get messages from in future, basically I'd like a 'fresh start' with my imessage account.  If I change my Apple ID to a new email address, will those people still be able to imessage me, or will (as i am hoping) they be unable to contact me as the email address associated with imessage that they've been using would now be out of date?\n\nA: When you change your Apple ID - the actual text you enter before you enter your password - then it is similar to changing your telephone number. So, yes you have a new account at that point with respect to people messaging you. \nYes, the bill still comes to you and it rings the phone you used to have, but people need to discover or be told your new \"digits\" before they can \"call\" you.\nNow - there are two qualifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your Apple ID is @mac.com or @me.com (or otherwise Apple provided), you can't change your Apple ID.\n\n*If you use an iPhone and have a phone number associated with that Apple ID, you may have to turn off receiving messages from that phone number temporarily or permanently if people are sending you iMessages to that phone number and it then gets directed to your new Apple ID. The good news is the new ID doesn't leak to the senders when they send you a message. The bad news, you could leak the new Apple ID if you reply and your \"caller ID\" for iMessage is your Apple ID instead of your phone number.\n\n", "Q: Find the target of an alias or link in Quicksilver Can I find the target of an alias or symbolic link using Quicksilver?

How can I do this using free tools - I know there are a couple of pay options available, but I would like to use free tools if possible.\nPlease note that I don't want to playback/record the audio, but extract it directly from the DVD. The DVD has a stereo PCM track.\nIdeally, I want to end up with one audio file per chapter/track.\nI know how to use the command line, so scripts are welcome as well. Homebrew is installed as well.\nUpdate:\nI've read the following two guides for using VLC, but they seem to be outdated, the screens seem to have changed in recent versions of VLC. Especially the Convert/Save menu item is now named Convert/Stream and the screen seems to have changed considerably.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.videolan.org/Extract_audio\n\n*http://www.wikihow.com/Rip-DVD-Audio-to-MP3-Using-VLC-Media-Player\n\nA: Here's how I did it in the end, since I was unsuccessful using VLC. In some cases, I ended up with static in the file, and the command line instructions from some of the guides I posted in the question failed, since the commands seem to have changed.\nI also tried tools like ffmpeg, but didn't get any usable output from that either.\nWhat finally worked were the instructions found here: http://www.essl.de/wp/2008/01/28/rip-audio-from-a-dvd/\nFirst, I installed the following tools using Homebrew:\n$ brew install lame\n$ brew install mplayer\n\nSecondly, to get a list of the chapters of the DVD, I used this with the DVD in the drive of my MacBook Pro:\n$ mplayer -identify -frames 0 dvd://1 | grep \"_CHAPTERS\"\n\nThis will print the number of chapters per title, in my case, I noticed that there are 13  tracks in the first title.\nTo get the available audio channels listed, I used a similar command:\n$ mplayer -identify -frames 0 dvd://1 | grep \"aid\"\n\nThis showed that the channel with the aid value of 160 had the DVD's stereo track (lpcm).\nTo extract the audio and convert it to MP3, I wrote the following reusable script (ripaudio.sh), which extracts and converts one chapter:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nCHAPTER=$1\nAID=$2\n\nmplayer -benchmark -vc null -vo null dvd://1 -chapter $CHAPTER-$CHAPTER -aid $AID -ao pcm:fast:file=$CHAPTER.wav && lame --preset standard $CHAPTER.wav $CHAPTER.mp3 && rm $CHAPTER.wav\n\nMake the script executable using\n$ chmod +x ripaudio.sh\n\nCall it to extract the first chapter using\n$ ./ripaudio 1 160\n\nWhat this basically does is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*MPlayer extracts the audio track with id 160 of the first track and saves it to a file called 1.wav. The video part of the track is ignored\n\n*The Lame encoder is used to encode the .wav file into an MP3 file called 1.mp3. Lame's standard preset is used.\n\n*The file 1.wav is deleted.\n\n*The commands are chained using the && operator to make sure they only run when the previous one succeeds. The whole mplayer etc. command needs to be on a single line.\n\n\nTo convert all of the chapters, the following for loop can be used:\nfor i in {1..13}; do ./ripaudio.sh $i 160 ; done\n\nThis will take a while, but once it's done, you'll end up with one MP3 file per chapter in the current directory.\nThe script can easily be adapted to use something like flac instead of lame for the encoding. Place the script in your user's ~/bin folder to call it from any location.\nWhile this took a while to research and doesn't have a fancy UI, it was the best method I've found.\n\nA: You can use VLC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open VLC.\n\n*Press ⌘D and insert disc or select VIDEO_TS folder.\n\n*Select the box for Streaming/Saving.\n\n*Click Settings.\n\n*In Streaming and Transcoding Options, select File and browse to a location to save the file.\n\n*In Transcoding Options, uncheck Video and check Audio, then select a format (mp3) and bitrate.\n\n*Click OK, then Open.

I have a MacBook Pro\nHow can I install OS X Mavericks if my HDD only has Windows on it?\n\nA: You can use Internet Recovery if the normal Recovery HD won't boot.\nBoot whilst holding ⌘⌥R until you get the spinning globe.\n\nA: Since the disk only has Windows on it, then it will not have a recovery partition.  If your Mac is older than around 2012, then it will not have Internet Recovery Mode either.\nHere are the steps to follow if you want to legally install Mac OS X on your hard drive on an early Mac.  \n(Note that while this will only work for early Mac's say 2010 or 2009 or older.  Newer macs will not allow you to install OS X 10.6.  In those cases you really need to locate your original install disks or hope that your version of the Mac has Internet Recovery Mode on it):\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase OS X 10.6 installation disks from Apple using this link:\nhttp://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC573Z/A/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard\n\n*Wait for the discs to show up in the mail.  \n\n*When they do show up, insert the first disk.  While powering up your mac, hold the C key until you are presented with an option of which disk to boot - select your DVD.\n\n*(Don't have a DVD drive?  Then sorry, there is no legal way to install OS X on your computer.)\n\n*Once you have 10.6 installed, you can upgrade to 10.6.8 over the internet by going to the Apple icon and clicking on Software Update.\n\n*Once you have 10.6.8 you will have access to the App store, where you will be allowed to upgrade to the latest OS X version (Currently El Capitan), only if you have a valid Apple ID.  You can only upgrade to the latest version, you cannot upgrade legally to any intermediate versions.  \n\n\nI want to make it crystal clear that, in your situation, you absolutely cannot legally have Mavericks installed on your Mac, unless you previously purchased Mavericks through the app store with your Apple ID.  Apple only allows you to purchase 10.6 or the bleeding edge latest, they do not allow you to purchase old versions of OS X.  You can download old versions of OS X, but only if you had previously upgraded to that particular version using your Apple ID.\nFollow these steps below to load any version of Mac OS X on any computer at any time.  Note that these instructions are against Apple EULA:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pirate a bootable DVD or bootable USB copy of the OS X version you want to have on your computer.\n\n*Put the DVD or USB stick into your Mac, boot your Mac, and it will install the pirated OS.\n\n*Your system will run exactly as if you legally purchased a disk.\n\n", "Q: Does Mavericks break the ability to create a wifi network that other devices can connect to? I'm not talking about sharing an Ethernet connection via Wifi, but about creating a separate WiFi network, not connected to the Internet.\nIn previous versions of OS X, I could create a wifi network by clicking the wifi network in the status bar and choosing \"Create Network...\"\nI can still do that in Mavericks, but my Nexus 7 does not see the network I created.\nMy iPhone does see the network, but in a separate section called Devices, below the normal wifi networks. When I connect, it warns that the wifi network is not connected to the Internet. When I ask it to proceed, it connects, but immediately turns on 3G so that it remains connected to the Internet. It looks like in the process of adding this intelligence between their devices (Mac and iOS), Apple broke the ability of non-Apple devices, like the Nexus 7 in this example, to see and connect to the network.\nDoes anyone know about this, and how to create a wifi network that non-Apple devices can connect to?\nThe Mac is a 2012 Retina Macbook Pro, 15-inch, and the Nexus 7 is a 2012 model.\n\nA: It still works fine in Mavericks for me. All devices can connect to the networks that I create, so I don't think anything's changed in the OS with regard to this.

If my MDP-HDMI convertor is damaged or not and I should by another version of connector or my iMac has some problem or I should turn something on to make connector working.\nMDP-HDMI convertor has not separate cable. It just plugs in.\n\nA: Thunderbolt ports allow connectivity to Mini DisplayPort. Since your converter just plugs in and then an HDMI cable (of any length that you supply) is then plugged into your converter and into a display, it should work just fine provided there is no damage to either the HDMI cable or the converter itself. If the Mac isn't recognizing the display, check the HDMI cable or the display first. Try to test the converter on another Mac with Thunderbolt before you deem it dead but Thunderbolt does indeed work with Mini DisplayPort.\n", "Q: Disable wireless network card Mac OS X I wonder if there is any way, how to turn off / disable the wireless network interface or driver, so I cannot connect to WiFi from running OS. I have MacBook Pro with OS X Mavericks.\nThe reason for this is I have some exams at the University and if I want to use my own notebook, I have to turn off the WiFi in some more permanent way (for example from BIOS, if I had PC).\nI have installed rEFIt so I can enter to some kind of EFI Shell, but I honestly don't know, what I can do here to not destroy my computer.\n\nA: You can move the IO80211Family.kext from /System/Library/Extensions. The Wi-Fi won't function without this file, so moving it will prevent the Wi-Fi from working. If you leave the file on an external drive, you won't be able to re-enable it without the file.\nAlternatively, if you're able to disable the admin account, it's a bit easier.

I did that because repairing and rebuilding the database didn't work for me, and magically the image re-appeared.\nIn most cases the photos had to be edited meaning I must have repositioned or edited them at some point. So, you might have to use the arrow to turn your photo upright.\n\nA: Revert to original was grayed out for me too, so I tried \"Rotate Clockwise\" and that Worked!  I then selected \"Rotate Counterclockwise\" and the image was visible again in the proper orientation.\n\nA: After my update to Sierra, some of my photos appeared as grey triangles with an exclamation point too.

Obviously, there's another simpler fix in some setting somewhere....but this worked. \n\nA: Turning them horizontally makes them appear for some odd reason.\n", "Q: iOS 7 seems to be killing apps too often I have an iPhone 4s running iOS 7.  I've noticed a pattern regarding apps \"reloading\" or starting back up from where they were after switching to another app and back.\nOn previous versions of IOS, I noticed that apps would sometimes reload after window switching, but it seemed to me to be somewhat random, and somewhat based upon which app I was originally running.  For example, if I was playing Angry Birds, I knew that it would take the phone powering off or a really long time even switching between apps before it would have to reload; however with Scrabble - it seemed like I could answer a text message and the app would restart and ask me to log back in.\nWith iOS 7, this behavior seems different and completely predictable.  No matter what app I am using, if I switch to mobile Safari, that app will need to reload - even if only 2 seconds have passed, but I can switch to any other app, or do anything else short of powering off the phone, and the app I returned to would start where I left off.  Switching to Safari forces any other app to reload when switching-every time.\nCan anyone confirm this?\nIs it a function of something I can control?\nWhat is it a function of?\n\nA: iOS will kill apps if it needs to.\nThere's not really much you can do about it, without jailbreaking. iOS will automatically manage an app's memory, and will kill an app if another app requests more memory. Also, apps using a large amount of CPU will cause iOS to kill other apps so that the foreground app always has the best experience.\nIf you find that it's killing apps more than it should be, try using apps with less memory usage. For example, try only opening one tab in Safari, then switch apps and switch back. It should be less likely to be terminated if it has less tabs open since there will be less memory usage.\nFor more information about multitasking, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: Understanding multitasking\n\nA: After 3 phone calls that each lasted about an hour or more, and backing up, erasing, resetting to factory, rinse and repeat several times, the answer I got from a senior apple tech was not encouraging. \nHe says that ios7 stores more info per app than ios6 did. But the cache memory (being hardware) is still the same size, and now the same amount of apps can't fit in the cache. \nSometimes larger apps will cause multitasking to dump every other app in the cache. Try running Clash of Clans. \nTry doing a hard restart. This will give you a little more room in your multitasking cache, but it will only last a half a day before you can only multitask 3 or 4 apps at a time again\n", "Q: Mac mini bluetooth or multitouch failures after hibernating I recently purchased a Mac mini and have begun having a problem with bluetooth. I've made a bunch of changes to the system all at once, so some of the information I'll provide is probably not relevant.\nI am currently running 10.8.5 (12F45) off of a new second hard drive that I installed (a Crucial M500 SSD). I have an Apple Extended Keyboard with an iMate ADB/USB adapter and a Magic Trackpad as my input devices. I had used this Magic Trackpad and keyboard with a MacBook Pro (running Lion) for about two years without any problems. \nThe problem that I have encountered is that occasionally (not every time), when I wake the computer from hibernation (which it automatically enters after a brief period of sleep overnight), bluetooth is malfunctioning in a strange way. Bluetooth is indicated as on in System Preferences and in the menubar, but cannot be turned off. The trackpad is not indicated as connected. Here's the strange part: the trackpad still partially works. I just used it to wake the computer (not the power button). I can move the cursor around the screen and click on things if I press on the trackpad, but none of the gestures work – scrolling, swiping, zooming, etc. and I can't tap to click. When I go to the Trackpad preference pane, it thinks no trackpad is connected, and when I go to the Bluetooth preferences, the name of the bluetooth module shows as:\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*checked software update to make sure all updates are installed\n\n*unpaired trackpad from MacBook Pro\n\n*unpaired and repaired trackpad to Mac mini\n\n*reset NVRAM and SMC\n\n*killing blued process\n\n\nNone of these has had a lasting effect; killing blued never worked.\nOne of the things I've noticed is that when I wake the computer and this condition occurs, I see the following two messages in the Console:\nkernel[0]: [AppleMultitouchDevice::willTerminate] entered\nkernel[0]: [AppleMultitouchDevice::stop] entered\n\nWhereas normally when I wake the computer, I get these two messages:\nkernel[0]: [AppleMultitouchHIDEventDriver::start] entered\nkernel[0]: [AppleMultitouchDevice::start] entered\n\nI'm kind of at my diagnostic wits-end. I'm willing to try a fresh install of Mountain Lion, but I'd kind of like to know why this problem is happening so that I'm confident a reinstall will be a permanent fix. Thanks in advance for the suggestions.\n\nA: As it turns out, the problem was one with either the iMate ADB/USB adapter or the Apple Extended Keyboard (AEK). Since the AEK requires an ADB/USB adapter, and I don't have another one around, I can't determine which component was the cause. Either way, since I replaced the AEK with an Apple USB Keyboard, the problem has not returned.\n", "Q: Hot corners for mouse only When I work with a mouse I want to use hot corners. When I work with the Trackpad, I don't. Is there an option for this? The hot corners should only work if I used my mouse to  activate it.\nI'm not optimistic, but I can't be the only one who wants it to work like this.\n\nA: You cannot differentiate what kind of mouse/input device triggers hot corners. To the computer, a pointing device (mouse, trackball, trackpad, etc.) is a pointing device and all give input the same way so there's no way for it to differentiate what is actually moving the mouse. Hardware settings for each different device (such as tracking speed for a mouse vs a trackpad) are a different story.\n", "Q: Google plus zip extracts as .EXE files I went to google plus autobackup and made and downloaded all my photos/movies as zip files.

Why is it there? Otherwise the system works fine.\n\n\nA: I've seen this happen after a restart - I believe it is to do with Bonjour and has something to do with Bonjour not releasing the name during the shutdown process. When the computer restarts and tries to register with the same name - it appends the (2) / (3) in order to preserve unique names.\nThere might be a few things that do not work for you after this - for example, other users on your network who have bookmarked or otherwise stored links to your Bonjour services via your original name won't be able to connect properly.

I have an iPhone 4S running 6.1.3 that a friend gave me after upgrading to a newer model. It is deactivated, but is still fully functional on WiFi. I'm considering trying to jailbreak it, but I'm concerned that if there's an issue and I need to restore it from a backup, I won't be able to use it without activating it as a phone. Is it possible to restore a deactivated iPhone from backup?\n\nA: Unless there's an active SIM in the phone or the IMEI is in use on a CDMA network (like Verizon or Sprint) then nothing will happen to it if you wipe/restore from a backup. It might say it's trying to activate but it actually won't. In the background, it'll attempt to \"activate\" but will just get a null response from whatever cell network it was trying to activate on. Feel free to use it like an iPod touch. If you DO want to use it as a phone, however, you just need to either put an active SIM in it or call up Verizon/Sprint (or whatever CDMA carrier) and give them the IMEI and follow their instructions to activate it on your plan/line/whatever.\n", "Q: VNC via SSH Problem I am trying to screen share to my Mac Server, on my home LAN, remotely via the internet.\nI can VNC to my server while on the LAN find with vnc://lanserver:5900.\nI am forwarding port 22 from my DSL to the LAN VNC computer.\nI can SSH to the LAN PC through the firewall ok.\nI can setup the SSH tunnel, logs:\n\nAuthenticated to xx.xxx.xxx.xxx ([xx.xxx.xxx.xxx]:22).\n  debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:5901 forwarded to remote address x.x.x.x:5900\n  debug1: Local forwarding listening on ::1 port 5901.\n  debug1: channel 0: new [port listener]\n  debug1: Local forwarding listening on 127.0.0.1 port 5901.\n  debug1: channel 1: new [port listener]\n  debug1: channel 2: new [client-session]\n\nWhen I try vnc://127.0.0.0.1:5901 on the remote machine, I get a timeout error:\n\nlanserver:~ user$ debug1: Connection to port 5901 forwarding to x.x.x.x port 5900 requested.\n  debug1: channel 3: new [direct-tcpip]\n  lanserver:~ user$ channel 3: open failed: connect failed: Operation timed out\n\nI'm out of options trying to find out why the connection times out.\n\nA: It looks to me like you're using the wrong remote IP address in your tunnel. You should be using -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5900 ....\nIt's important to realize that the destination IP for the tunnel is where the remote (server) computer forwards the connection to, so 127.0.0.1:5900 means it connects to port 5900 on the server itself.\nIt looks like you're using ssh -L 5901:PublicIPofServer:5900 ..., which makes the server try to connect to port 5900 on its own public IP. But that's actually the WAN IP of the router the server's behind, so unless that router forwards port 5900 to the private IP of the server (in which case you wouldn't need the SSH tunnel) AND the router supports NAT loopback (aka hairpin NAT), this won't work.\n", "Q: Keeping New and Old Ipads My wife gave me a new IPad for Christmas.

So for all of the iPhone 4Ses that got the grayed out WiFi problem after upgrading to iOS 7, the only fix that seems to actually work is basically heating up the iPhone up (till about the point it gives a heat warning), then chilling it, and then restarting it. (I've seen this solution in various places, such as this Apple Discussions thread).\nBut what exactly is happening? Is there still a physically damaged WiFi chip in these devices that the software has been tricked into using? Or is it a weird work around that tricks defective software into working properly?\n\nA: I have tried this fix and it does work although it wasnt permanent.\nThe only thing I can think it is doing is re setting the base temps of the motherboard and chip, much like a PC. In other words the software might be looking for the difference between the motherboard and the chip temp. \nIf they have set this too low for the 4S then obviously it would show it is overheating even if it isnt.\nBy heating up the motherboard and the already hot chip (which wont heat up further as much) you are re setting the parameters and so it works for a while or permanently. I'll try further.\n\nA: Drastically changing temperature on electronic components causes solder joints and other connections/components like capacitors, to expand and/or contract. It is usually used as a  quick way to diagnose where a problem is. \nSo in the 4S's case, it may be bad solder joints, a bad capacitor or even the wifi chip (USI 339S0154)'s oscillator isn't calibrated correctly and the change in temperature allows it to change slightly. However I haven't looked at the datasheet to verify this.\nIt is interesting to note that almost everyone having this problem got it with the upgrade to iOS 7. The only non iOS 7 issue I've come across is in this video, Apple iphone 4s no wifi no bluetooth, but the video is in Italian so I don't know what he is saying, other than that applying heat to the wifi IC seems to fix the issue.\n\nA: i'll throw in a bit of information i found.\nhad iphone 4s, wifi was intermittently failing during ios 6.  upgrade to 7 killed it.\nretired to ipod status, got new phone.\nupdated to 8, no change in function.  it was working every now and then.\nused hair dryer while it was on ios 8.00.  this fixed it for about a week.\nupgraded phone to ios 8.0.2.  instantly wifi was greyed out.\nhair dryered it again, and it resumed working.\nthis verifies something i had read before.  that there is a connector to the wifi that is a status/utility channel.  if the os can't talk to it (ios7+), then it registers as missing.  if you force it to send an overheat/fail signal then it reconnects and finds the wifi hardware again?  this gets wiped out on os reinstall.\nHOWEVER.  i also blew away the connector to the battery with the heat.  the low temp solder had melted (it's not even solder, but some low temp joiner) and it was only being held by screws with bad continuity at the pins.  batter started acting very intermittently.\nsending it away to get fixed now, since it's small/specialized soldering.\nbe careful with the heat.\n\nA: The fact that it requires chilling the iPhone in order for the WiFi issue to be resolved means that this remains a hardware problem. iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S were simply not intended (or sufficiently tested) to be run with iOS 7 and this makes the WiFi chip overheat. \nIt's the first time I hear the heating trick. A normal chilling (i.e. putting the iPhone in the fridge) has worked for me in the past. Heating the device might break something further.\n\nA: I had this problem in my iphone 4S with IOS 6.1.3. Chilling only works temporarily.\nI tend to agree with the theory of lose soldering or connections, which are helped by heating. \n\nA: I had the usual iPhone 4s symptoms: WiFi greyed out, degraded BlueTooth, very high battery drain. \nAfter updating everything and checking each app I finally tried the hair dryer but mine was too weak. I used my heat gun with the temperature on moderate. After 5 minutes the corner of the display started to blacken but would recover as soon as I took the heat away. I held it with the top 1cm mostly black but gave up at 10 minutes without getting the over-temperature warning. I did a hard reset and left it to cool. When I turned it back on all the problems have gone and all it working 24 hours later.\nSo I still don't know why it worked but I add my story to the data mix. Maybe someone will work it out.\nIt can't be a hardware failure or it couldn't be fixed without replacement.\nIf it is purely software why did my attempt fix it?\nI suspect an aerial connection problem cause part of the OS to stay in a loop.\nI think I was running 7.0.3 for a while before the issue. 7.1 changed nothing.\nWhile I had the problem a number of settings pages were quite slow to load: 'settings', 'general', 'personal hotspot'\n", "Q: Chromecast: maximize tab on TV while multitasking on Chrome? I'm trying to use Chromecast to watch an ESPN3 game in full-screen on my TV, while continuing to work in Chrome on my laptop (OS: Mavericks). The ESPN3 player doesn't have an option to stream directly through Chromecast (to my knowledge), so I've been casting the entire tab. This works fine, I can see the tab on my TV. If I want to view full-screen, I can maximize the viewer. This maximizes the viewer on the TV, and also my laptop screen. So far, so good.\nThe problem is, I want to keep using my laptop for other stuff. If I want a different application, I can cmd-tab to Finder, then right-click the Chrome icon and hide it, allowing me to see other stuff on my screen. However, if I want to use Chrome, as soon as I activate any Chrome window, the video pops up as full-screen an obscures my view.\nI suppose I could use a different browser for internet stuff, but that's obnoxious! For example, I'm using Chrome's dev tools pane to debug a page I'm working on. I don't want to give up using Chrome for other purposes just because I'm watching something on TV.\nHow can I go about watching a full-screen tab on TV, while still being able to use Chrome for other purposes on my computer?\n\nUpdate: I tried having the media window in a separate space, but when I go fullscreen it always takes up the laptop screen no matter which space I switch to.\n\nA: Have you tried creating a new space, opening a new Chrome window in that space, opening ESPN in that new window, and cast that single tab on that isolated Chrome window to your TV? Then you should be able to work in your other space(s) and leave that one alone/aside to stream to your TV.\nI do something similar when I want to work in Chrome but stream Hulu/Netflix/whatever to my TV via AirPlay (I set the AirPlay display as a separate display and drag over a totally separate Chrome window to that AirPlay display).\n\nA: The Chrome Extension Fullscreen Anything should allow you to do this.\n\nA: With Chrome 35, Fullscreen stays within the tab, which should directly solve your problem.\n", "Q: Running a bunch of commands in Terminal I run the following commands for logkext a lot in my terminal and would like a know a way to automate the whole process.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*type \"sudo logKextClient\"\n\n*Type in administrator password\n\n*logKextClient has its own password which I need to type now\n\n*logKextClient is running now. prompt is logKextClient >\n\n*I have to type a command here. \"open\"\n\n*Then I need to close a window that opens.

The unix command you may want to explore is /usr/bin/expect.\nIt can get complex quickly, but basically what it does is act as a mediator between you and the programs you're running so it can provide answers that you would normally have to type. As an example, I built this script so I could automate the process of printing the logKext output. You should recognize all of the commands you'd normally type to logkextClient yourself...\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\nspawn logkextClient\nexpect \"logKext Password:\"\nsend \"mylogkextpassword\\r\"\nexpect \"logKextClient > \"\nsend \"print\\r\"\nexpect \"logKextClient > \"\nsend \"quit\\r\"\nclose\n\nBack in 10.5 and 10.6 this worked well for me for outputting the logKext print so I could pipe it into an email and send it. However, I was running this logged in as root to terminal, so it was simple.\nTheoretically, if you weren't logged in as root, you could instead say\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\nspawn sudo -k logkextClient\nexpect \"Password:\"\nsend “myrootpassword\\r”\nexpect \"logKext Password:\"\nsend \"mylogkextpassword\\r\"\nexpect \"logKextClient > \"\nsend \"print\\r\"\nexpect \"logKextClient > \"\nsend \"quit\\r\"\nclose\n\n(note that I used sudo -k intentionally to be consistent and require a password every time)\nSo you could use your favorite command line editor to create this script, do a chmod +x to it and drag it to the dock for launching... Theoretically.\nBut I have been having problems in Mavericks getting /usr/bin/expect to behave properly with sudo, so this isn't working for me in other scripts like it should. And I don't have logKext installed at all anymore for testing anyway.\nBut I think this is the direction you may want to head.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You can use Automator to do this.

Just start the application, select the drive to be formatted in the left column, make double sure you've selected the right one and select the file system type, partition sizes etc. on the right hand side.\n\nA: First, it is important to be aware that technically Drives are not formatted, Volumes are. One drive can have multiple volumes, even if in practice most users just fill the whole drive with a single volume.\nNormally the drive's volume(s) should appear on the desktop when you plug it in. If that were the case, you could simply hit Command+I with a volume highlighted and see its Format listed in the General section of the Info window that pops up.\nSince the drive is not appearing in that case, you will need to run Disk Utility. If the drive is available there, you will see an icon and name for the drive on the left, and then below that an icon and name for each volume on the drive. Click on the volume (the indented one), not the drive, and at the bottom of the window you will see a Format field reporting the format of that volume.\nMake sure that you click on the Volume, not the Drive, because as I explained at the beginning there is no format on the Drive itself.\nFrom there you can easily reformat the drive by clicking the Drive (not the Volume) and selecting the Partition tab to the right. That brings up a tab where you can delete existing partitions, create new ones, and format them. You can treat Partition as a synonym for Volume (they're not exactly the same thing, but for your purposes they are).\nAll that being said, if your drive/volume is not appearing when you plug it in, it is likely that either the drive is crashed or the volume is corrupted. \nIn the latter case, you may see the Drive icon but not the Volume icon in Disk Utility, and you can try erasing the drive from the Erase tab and reformatting.\nIf you don't see either icon in Disk Utility, the drive is crashed/broken and should be replaced.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: TextMate : Keeping my KeyBindings after an update I'm using TextMate 2 with some custom KeyBindings. I change them in /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings.dict. It works great, but everytime I update them app they get reset. (I guess the update replace the whole .app). \nAny suggestion how I could prevent that (= not set again my keybindings).  \n\nA: Under MacroMates' keyBindings page is written:\n\nIn addition TextMate has a /path/‍to/‍TextMate.app/‍Contents/‍Resources/‍KeyBindings.dict file with some extra key bindings which are specific to TextMate (and thus not appropriate to put in the per user global key bindings file). You can copy this file to ~/Library/‍Application Support/‍TextMate\nand edit it, this will then take precedence over the bundled file.\n\nAs this file won't be replaced during the Application's update, your keybindings will remain.\nNote: As Matthieu points out, you will need to rename the file to DefaultKeyBinding.dict to make it work.\n", "Q: New USB ethernet adaptor not recognized on network at work I recently purchased a new USB ethernet adaptor for my MacBook Air (running 10.8.5) direct from the Apple store, but it doesn't work on the ethernet network at work. The old USB ethernet adaptor works fine, and thus it is not a problem with my ethernet card, cable or the network. Any ideas what might be causing this?\n\nA: If you needed to register your MAC address for your computer to be authorized on the network at work, then your problem may be that you have inadvertantly registered the MAC address for the original USB-ethernet adaptor, rather than the MAC address of the internal ethernet interface in you computer. The problem is that the new USB adaptor generates a different MAC address than your old one, and is therefore not recognized by your work network. \nTo fix this problem, you will need to plug in your new USB ethernet adaptor, get its MAC address and request that this MAC address be authorized on your work network. \nYou can find the MAC address for your USB ethernet adaptor using System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced... -> Hardware. This will give you the MAC address on the en1 ethernet interface going to the adaptor, rather than the en0 interface going to the computer. The en1 MAC address changes when plug in different USB ethernet adaptors, but the en0 does not. \nTo see how en1 MAC address changes and find the stable en0 MAC address of your ethernet card, open up a terminal window and type:\n$ ifconfig\n\nThen plug in your different adpators, and repeat the ifconfig command.\n", "Q: How can I go back to Mountain Lion from Mavericks My question it simple: How can I go back to Mountain Lion from Mavericks?\nMy iMac (late 2010, Processor 3.4 GHz Core i7, Memory 8GB 1333 MHz DDR3) became EXTREMELY slow with Mavericks - It was great with Mountain Lion.\nIn the beginning I thought I had to do with Google Chrome, but now it get slow with pretty much every program.\nHelp!\n\nA: Looking on google would have avoid this question. As Macworld UK described it, here are the steps : \n\n\n*\n\n*Get a copy of Mountain Lion\n\n*Download the recovery Disk Assistant\n\n*Create a recovery install Disk\n\n*Restart in Recovery Mode\n\n*Erase your Main HD. \n\n*Install a fresh OS. \n\n\n\nBUT : \nIMHO, your computer should be fast enough to handle Mavericks. The problem isn't probably the system itself. You should look at the Activity Monitor to see if there are some anomalies (high memory pressure, high CPU% etc.) \n", "Q: What is the best way to automatically create a movie from my iPhoto videos? When I first started using a Mac almost 6 years ago iMovie had a mode (automovie?) where I could just throw a folder at it and it would create a movie from all the photos and videos. This was a great way for someone with no time to create a family video.\nNow I'm trying to do basically the same thing with iMovie '09 and iPhoto and can't figure out the best way.\nI want an all-Apple or free solution to just taking all the videos from my iPhoto library and putting them into a movie in chronological order. I really won't want to spend hours dragging and dropping clips into a movie (either on my Mac or on the iPad in iMovie or Avid Studio).\nWhat is the best way to do this?\nEDIT: I realized I have iMovie '09 not '11 as first reported so that might change the technique. In the bottom left of iMovie I do see an entry labeled iPhoto Videos but it is always empty.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the iPhoto Library.\n\n\n*Click Create → Movie and select No Theme.\n\n*Select the photos/videos.\n\n*Press E.\nAll the photos and videos will be added sequentially to the timeline.\n\n*Export your timeline normally.\n", "Q: Using iMac 2012 as a monitor for MacBook Pro 2012 Can I use a Macbook Pro as a monitor for an iMac?\nBoth of them are on sale from a startup that went out of business, and were originally bought in 2012.\n\nA: The answer you are looking for is Target Display mode.\nAnd yes it is compatible with this setup (If they are 2012 machines with Thunderbolt).

But it is not, see the picture below.\nPersonally, I don't like it being this way (if this is not a bug). I tried 3 different PDF files, and I got the same results.\nIs there any option to change this?\n\n\nA: This isn't a bug, it's a feature, designed to replicate a real-life highlighter. The highlight feature works the same in the new iBooks, as well as iBooks for iOS. There is currently no way to change this.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n", "Q: How to bind contacts to another apple ID I have two iphones who were using the same apple ID, so they had the same contacts and this was not ok, because every iphone is used by a different person and we want to have different contacts. So I created another apple ID, and I logged with that account (settings->itunes store and app store->changed the apple ID and verified it).  \nBut even if I changed the apple ID, the contacts seem to keep being bound to the old apple ID, so that from an iphone I can change the contacts that are displayed in the other. \n\nA: If the contacts in question are coming from iCloud, you'll need to change the account in Settings → iCloud to a different iCloud account.\nYour contacts may also be coming from a different account (or multiple accounts).  Check other accounts in Settings → Mail, Contacts, Calendars to see if any of them may also be a source of contacts.\n", "Q: Mavericks Hot Corners does not work I have set up a hot corner for my screensaver on system preferences but it does not activate when i move my cursor to the appropriate corner of the screen. \n\nA: Usually this is a temporary glitch that a restart fixes. If you have this failing after that - you can test a new user account.\nIf that works, then your preference file needs to be cleared. See this post for details: Hot Corners for Mission Control stop working\n", "Q: Does Apple make a keyboard with a wide \"return\" key, and modifier keys with their symbols printed on them? I happened to notice in a picture that the Apple \"German\" keyboard had the modifier keys labeled with their symbols, e.g., the option key is labeled as \"⌥\".  (It's confusing as heck that the Apple's U.S. keyboards don't display that, but I'm not going to ask why they did that.)\nBut unfortunately for me, the German keyboard has a tall and skinny 'return' key, which I'm sure would be frustrating for me.  I looked through the keyboard pictures I could find, and the U.S. and Japanese keyboards are the only variants I could find with wide 'return' keys -- and they're also the only ones I found without the modifier symbols printed on them!\nDoes Apple make a keyboard, for any region, with both a wide 'return' key, and the modifier keys labeled as in the UI?\n\nA: As far as I can tell the answer is \"no\".  This page shows graphics of the various keyboards made by Apple.  \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht2841\nWhether a 3rd party makes an ANSI version with symbols on the keys I don't know.\n\nA: The difference in the return key is determined by the physical/mechanical standard used.\nEurope uses the ISO standard with the \"skinny\" return while the US (and Australia where I am) use the ANSI standard.\nSee this Wikipedia article for more details http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Mechanical_and_visual_layouts\nThe ISO standard, ISO 9241, also seems to mandate that little character on the option key. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9241#ISO_9241-110\nANSI, by comparison, seems not to talk about what's on the keys.\nSo one assumes that Apple would prefer not to have the character on the key but instead have option and alt and does so where it isn't \"forced\".\n\nA: Here are two alternatives.\nMatias Keyboards\nCheck out Matias keyboards, designed for Mac. They have an extensive set of symbols printed on every key.\n\n\nKB Covers\nKB Covers makes molded silicone sheets that fit over every different model of keyboard that Apple makes, for MacBooks and desktops. They have one model that provides printed symbols that show many different OS X keyboard shortcuts. Their product is inexpensive and it works with the Apple-brand keyboard you already have.\n\n\n", "Q: How to launch browser in iOS Simulator from command line? I want to launch the browser in iOS Simulator from the Terminal with specified URL.\nIs there any command for it? So that I can write in a script which will take URL as argument and launch simulator with browser and URL open on it.\n\nA: \n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone\\ Simulator.app/Contents/MacOS/iPhone\\ Simulator -SimulateApplication /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator7.0.sdk/Applications/MobileSafari.app/MobileSafari -u \"http://google.com/\"\n\nYes this really is one long command — make sure to run it all. Replace google.com with actual website, and iPhoneSimulator7.0.sdk with the relevant version of the simulator that you're using.\n\nA: On Xcode6 simctl was introduced so you can just open the terminal and type:\nxcrun simctl openurl booted \"https://google.com\" \n\nA: The path has changed for Xcode 6.0 (OS X Yosemite) and now it's:\nalias simulator='open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/iOS\\ Simulator.app'\n\nA: Another way to do it is to use a temp file that redirects to the URL you want, then opening this file in the simulator.  This isn't necessarily the best way, but it is a shorter command.\necho \"<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content='0;url=http://apple.stackexchange.com'>\" > ~/tmp/openURL.html; open ~/tmp/openURL.html -a /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone\\ Simulator.app/\nAs in the other answers, you can replace the URL (I put apple.stackexchange.com) with whatever you want. Just make sure you put http:// because open interprets arguments as filesystem paths by default.\nSadly, the bulk of the command is just the path to the iPhone Simulator bundle.\n\nA: Here's what to do : Go to Finder and run /Applications/Utilities/Terminal, and paste in the following code:\nopen /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone\\ Simulator.app\n\nThat should help if you use XCODE, or a iOS Simulator.\n\nA: osascript -e \"tell application \\\"iPhone Simulator\\\" to activate\"\n\n", "Q: Display color change The display on my MacBook Pro laptop has suddenly changed so that instead of white here I get a light yellow.

Somehow it switched the profile (I guess during the upgrade to Sierra) to Apple RGB. Changing it back to \"Color LCD\" solved my problem too (without calibrating).\n\nA: Was having the same problem. Display Calibration helps. :D just go to Sytem preferences, Display, Color Tab then Calibrate. :) \n\nA: I like Arc676's suggestion, however the yellowing you describe can also result from a loose video connection between the main board and the LCD screen. A search on \"macbook pro display connector loose yellow\" returns many horror stories, however, sometimes things just need a little jiggle to return to proper function.\n", "Q: Why does Network Restore on my MacBook Air 2012 give me Mountain Lion, not Mavericks I recently upgraded the SSD of my MacBook Air 2012\nVery happy with the Network Restore.  Hold CMD+R on start-up, use disk utility to format, and then network restore OSX.\nBut why does it only offer Mountain Lion?\nI then have to upgrade to Mavericks using the App Store.\nWhich isn't painful, but why couldn't I just restore to Mavericks in the first place?\n\nA: Internet Recovery will only download the original version of OS X that came with the computer. This is not configurable.\nBack when Internet Recovery was released, OS X updates weren't free, so Internet Recovery didn't know if you paid for the upgrade from Lion to Mountain Lion. Therefore it was easiest to just install the original OS X, and then make the user update afterwards.\n", "Q: Setting a firmware password Currently trying to use a script (preferably shell) to setup the firmware password on a fresh OSX install.

Does anyone have an idea how to adjust line height when the only tool you have is this font-chooser thingy (Is there a name for this)?\n\nThank you.\n\nA: This is Fontbook. It is simply a font library, not where you manipulate fonts. You do not define font properties there:\n\nThe Font Book application lets you install, remove, view, organize,\n  validate, enable, and disable fonts. Fonts are styles of type that\n  your computer uses to display and print text. OS X comes with many\n  preinstalled fonts.\n\nThe programme you are using will (or will not) have the tools to format fonts. If your programme does not have this, you cannot set this in Fontbook.\n\nA: The panel you're referring to is called the Font Panel. Unfortunately, there is no option to change the line height in it.\nYou can read more about technicalities of the panel here, although the documentation is hard to read.\nIt's likely that the developer of the application you are using is just using the stock panel (there aren't any options provided with it). It's kind of difficult and not really worth it to add new functionality to that panel, from my experience as a developer.

(i.e. when I login the directory listed is /private/var/root and I do rwx rights to every folder on harddisk)\nSo I'm sure there must be a way to achieve this. I've browsed the /configuration-file/pure-ftpd.conf file and couldn't see something like 'AllowRoot' anyway I don't remember arranging any conf file on the Mac mini Leopard.\nThe last thing I want to note is that the root password I enter on ftp is different than the one on the OS's user root. A bit puzzling really.\nAny suggestion is appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: I found the solution\n1- In Lion the PAM scheme is a bit different than Leopad, the /etc/pam.d/pure-ftpd file in particular. That's why the default pure-ftpd configuration in Lion didn't work. As a quick fix, you have to:\ncp /etc/pam.d/ftpd /etc/pam.d/pure-ftpd\ni.e. you copy the Lions' default ftpd PAM scheme to pure-ftpd. It works.\n2- For Lion, you have to install pure-ftpd-1.0.36, not 1.0.33 otherwise it hangs while trying to login to pure-ftpd.\n3- Lastly, you have to set a password for the user you want to use. In my case I set for root (don't worry about the root access, the pure-ftpd is not open to Internet I use it solely inside LAN for development)\npasswd root (enter any password)\nBecause you can set any password here, your root password can be different from the Mac OS X's user with root privileges.\n", "Q: Automator: Safari: Display Webpages, but no entry area?

The Display Webpages action doesn't request for user input by default, since it could use the value of a variable, etc as the URL.\nUse an action such as Ask For Text before the Display Webpages action. Note that the Ask For Text action doesn't parse URLs, so you'll need the http://.\n\n\nA: The intended URLs can be passed into the action by the Get Specified URLs action, or one of the other Safari actions to get web addresses.

You can access this menu by pressing the button a little longer or pressing ctrl + power button.\n\nA: I like the CTRL EJECT as it brings up a dialog allowing you to sleep, restart or shutdown, like so:\nPressing ENTER shuts down\nPressing R restarts\nPressing S sleeps\nESC cancels\nBTW if you have a PC keyboard with no EJECT key, use F12\n\nA: Putting your computer to sleep\n\nAbove is how to sleep your computer when it's on and logged in.\nThe keyboard shortcut is: ALT/OPT + CMD + Eject(i.e., ⌥ + ⌘ + ⏏).\n\nPutting your display to sleep\n\nAbove is the keyboard shortcut for putting your display to sleep. The computer itself will not go to sleep, only the display will power off.\nThe keyboard shortcut is: Shift + Ctrl + Eject (i.e. ⇧ + ⌃ + ⏏).\n\n\nNote: Computers that lack the Eject key\nFor computers that lack the ⏏ key – e.g. MacBooks – the Power key (⌽) can be used instead.\nAlso, it's possible to hold down the Power key for 1.5 seconds and then select from a menu if you want to Sleep, Restart or Power off. You can also access the menu immediately by Ctrl + ⌽.\n\nA: If you have a keyboard with no eject or power key, you can use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::S, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::D, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::R, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nOption-command-eject puts the Mac to sleep, control-shift-eject puts displays to sleep, and control-command-eject restarts the Mac.\n\nA: Supposing you're using an Apple Keyboard: Cmd+Option+Eject\n", "Q: Reinstall Numbers? I got myself into a state where App Store says that I have numbers \"installed\" but in fact I don't have it installed.

Someone help me?\n\nA: Taken from this support article:\n\nOS X Recovery includes a built in set of utilities as part of the\n  Recovery System. To start your computer from Recovery, restart your\n  Mac and hold down the Command key and the R key (Command-R).\n  Press and hold these keys until the Apple logo appears.\n\nThe recovery feature is limited to OS X Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite, and El Capitan.\n\nA: Make sure you're holding the keys for the entire duration of the boot until the spinning globe icon. 'Tapping' the keys isn't enough — you'll need to hold them for a bit (longer than the normal Recovery HD).\n", "Q: Is it possible to reset FileVault password in recovery mode? I have problems with my startup volume, and it's encrypted with FileVault. I don't remember the pasword, but have the recovery key. Is it possible to reset the password?\n\nA: If you have the recovery key (assuming it's the alphanumeric kind), you can reset your account password in the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your Mac to the FileVault 2 login window.\n\n*Enter your password incorrectly three times\n\n*It should prompt you for your recovery key. Enter it and hit return.\n\n\nYour Mac should boot and stop at the OS's login window.\n\n\n*\n\n*When prompted, reset your account's password.\n\n\nIf your Mac isn't able to boot from its regular boot drive and you can only start from the recovery drive, you should unlock and then decrypt your Mac prior to trying to fix your Mac. I have a post available here showing how to unlock and decrypt your Mac using your recovery key:\nUnlock or decrypt your FileVault 2-encrypted boot drive from the command line\n", "Q: Lost mail from Outbox in Mail 7.1 (1827) I was having trouble connecting to my smtp server to send mail and had multiple emails (7) in my outbox.  I made a configuration change that I thought would work, selected all messages in the Outbox, right-clicked and selected \"Send\". Mail confirmed that I wanted to send the selected messages now, I clicked \"Send\" and the messages disappeared from my outbox.\nHowever, the configuration change did not fix the issue and the emails were never delivered, and now they appear to have disappeared.  Is there any way to recover them?\n\nA: I, too, lost my Outbox, but for a different reason.  \nI composed 15 messages on an airplane and \"sent\" them, which put them in the 'Outbox'.  When I arrived home, I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cmd-A (to select all 15 messages from Outbox) \n\n*tried to send them (via Cmd-Shift-D)\n\n*answered 'Yes' to \"Send all these messages?\"\n\n*noticed that they were gone.  G-O-N-E.  Nowhere to be found.\n\n\nI eventually found them in:\n  ~/Library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes/Outbox.mbox/some-UUID-here/Data\nBy selecting a time that was an hour (or so) before their disappearance, I was able to restore them from my online backup service to a different location (e.g. ~/Desktop/mail_app_message_restore).  I'm betting that TimeMachine could do something similar.\nThe messages were distributed (hashed, actually) among many directories, but when I issued this command from the command line, I found all 15 missing messages:\n$ cd ~/Desktop/mail_app_message_restore    # or where you restored them\n$ find Outbox.mbox -type f\nOutbox.mbox/14D01FAB-9E5D-420D-8507-240D11CEC6D4/Data/5/4/1/Messages/145098.emlx\n[ 14 other files ... ]\n$\n\nNotice that the hash directories (e.g. Data/5/4/1) are just the reverse of the top few digits of the message filename.  All of mine were in this 5/4/1 directory, but your numbers will be different.  It's a big directory structure, but there were only a few messages sprinkled through it.\nBest of luck!!!\nMichael\nP.S.  Notice the side benefits of automagic backups?  What a great feature!  I'm so glad that it got a snapshot as soon as I got online, but that there was time before I tried to send them.  I think TimeMachine would have been even better about taking offline backups before I reconnected to the network.\n", "Q: Odd bug in iTerm — Why is my name wrong? \nI opened up iterm and it says \"jessica-s-phone\" I'm not sure what the term for that is. I checked my profile and it isn't there. \n\nA: It should be the name of your computer. If you go to sharing in the system preferences you should see \"Computer Name\" there.\n", "Q: Metallic ticking noise from the MBP I have an early 2011 MBP and opened it's back more than once, to replace RAM, HDD and 2 weeks ago I installed an SSD. For some time already I hear a faint ticking noise from the body when the laptop is running, laying on a flat surface. First I thought it's the HDD's head hitting an end position, that was part of the reason I replaced it. Now with the SSD I still hear the noise sometimes. \nI could not figure out what it depends on, sometime it comes and I hear 1 tick in irregular intervals form 1 to 5 secs, sometimes I hear a lot short after each other, and some other times the noise is not audible at all for hours. \nI have the impression that the noise comes from somewhere below the trackpad, around the place of the HDD, now SSD.\nAny idea what that could be?\n\nA: It's certainly inside the MacBook Pro. You should check this out : https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2387469?start=15&tstart=0\nThis should fix it, helped a lot of people. Click Here\nSo it happens when you have to apply conductive grease. It's certainly a problem with the CPU I think. After following the steps, your machine shouldn't make any sound.\n\nA: It would be quite easy to determine exactly from whence the sound emanates by taking a small tube about a foot long and listening to the bottom case (or the keyboard) - slowly moving around to locate the approximate place where the sound is loudest.\nIt's almost certainly the fan that cools the CPU/GPU and you can examine the internal layout of most any Mac by browsing iFixit.com\n", "Q: I can't buy gems in Clash of Clans, conflicting Apple IDs I downloaded Clash of Clans using my sisters Apple ID and her Game Center, on my iPhone. I backed up my phone. Then when I got my new phone and I created a new Apple ID and new Game Center for me.\nI had kept all my progress from my earlier phone. However, now when I try to buy gems, it pops up with this message:\n\nThis item is for an app that has been purchased by a different Apple ID. To buy this item with this Apple ID you must first purchase the app.\n\nI am guessing this means I have to delete the app and re-download it, but I am afraid I will lose all my progress.\nIs there an easy solution for the Apple ID confusion?\n\nA: Supercell saves your progress under your Game Center account. So, if you get a new device with a new Game Center account, you will lose your progress. To keep your progress, you will need to link your device to hers in the Clash of Clans settings.\n\nA: The issue is quite simple. The account you're signed into is not the account used to buy or download Clash of Clans. \nSign out with the current iTunes Store account under Store section in Preferences, and sign in with the one used to purchase CoC. Alternatively, you can delete the app and download it with the current account again. The progress is tied with your Game Center account, so your progress won't be lost. \nAll IAP in this game is one-time, so after purchasing, the effect is tied to your CoC progress and the current GameCenter account. If you ever need more for any GC/CoC account, you'll need to purchase again. \n", "Q: Export iPhoto library onto Time Machine? I have Time Machine, and am looking to have iphoto continuously and automatically back up my pictures. (I have so many images and would like them safely on a hard drive).\nI had to drag/copy my iPhoto library onto Time Machine, and I can open it and view pictures, but they are only the ones that were there at the time, and none of the new images that have been imported since then.\nI also know how to switch back and forth from the two iphoto libraries, my default one and the external library, but again same problem - only the older images appear when it's under the library of the external hard drive. \nFor some reason the iPhoto library which should be under Pictures, is nowhere on my Time Machine. How do I place the iPhoto library back into Time Machine, and have it just automatically back it up so that I don't manually have to do it? (I've tried googling this but can't find a black and white answer). \n\nA: Time Machine automatically copies everything on your user folder, so you don't have to manually drag your iPhoto library to your external drive to back it up. Unless of course you have excluded some files or folders on the Time Machine preference pane, in which case no backups of such resources are being made.\nIn order to see the library on your Time Machine backup, you would have to mount your .sparsebundle and then look for it, and it does not seem to be the case.\n", "Q: Access disk attached to Airport Extreme over internet? According to Apple's product page, the Airport Extreme...\n\n\"...can turn your external USB hard drive into a secure drive you can share across your Wi‑Fi network and access securely over the Internet.\"\n\n\nMy interpretation of the \"access securely over the Internet\" part is that if I plug in an external hard drive to an Airport Extreme on my home network, I can get to it from anywhere via the internet... including outside of my home network. \nAm I interpreting this correctly? If so, it sounds like a pretty awesome feature! I guess I'm skeptical though because when I Google around for this, I find nothing relevant... including any info from Apple. What gives?\n\nA: Sometimes, the only way to get an answer is to try it for yourself! So, I went out and bought an Airport Extreme. Bottom line:\nYES, YOU CAN ACCESS AN ATTACHED DISK REMOTELY FROM OVER THE INTERNET! \nThe magic happens with iCloud's Back to My Mac feature. Here's how you do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > iCloud: Turn on Back to My Mac\n\n*Airport Utility > Select AirPort Extreme > Edit > Disks: Tick \"Enable file sharing\" and \"Share disks over WAN\"\n\n*I chose to secure the shared disks \"With device password\"... meaning the password that is set for the AirPort Extreme.\n\n\nNow, when you're away from your local network, just click the name of your AirPort Extreme in a Finder window's sidebar (if you don't see it, make sure \"Back to My Mac\" is ticked in Finder > Preferences > Sidebar). \nAmazingly, that's it. It blows my mind that Apple isn't promoting this more heavily or that there's little talk about it out there. To me, this is a pretty killer feature!\n\nA: Best way to hook up a network drive is to add a network drive that get's its own IP address.  Adding a USB drive to an airport extreme is not good because it's not reliable. Tends to disconnect, and then to reconnect you have to reboot the airport and the usb disc.  Not worth it.\n", "Q: Respringing after updating Mobile Substrate in Cydia bricked my phone? I currently own an iPhone 4S running 6.1.3. I jailbroke it a week or so ago after being forced off of 6.1.2 in July. This isn't my first time jailbreaking, and I am pretty computer savvy, so don't be afraid to get technical.\nMy issue first started when I had five new updates in Cydia for some of my packages. I distinctly remember Mobile Substrate, Pdanet, iCaughtU, and then there were two others I can't recall now.\nWhen I first started, the download seemed to get stuck and after a few attempts of canceling and restarting the download, I finally got them to update. I was greeted with the Tap to Respring button as always and I proceeded with respringing.\nImmediately once my phone comes back on, I am greeted with the iOS 6 Welcome Screen. It asks me to choose a WiFi network, and then it starts to activate my phone.\nEvery time, without fail, my iPhone gives me the following message:\nCould Not Activate iPhone\n\nYour iPhone could not be activated\nbecause the activation server is\ntemporarily offline. Try connecting\nyour iPhone to iTunes to activate it, or try\nagain in a couple of minutes.\n\nIf the problem persists, contact Apple\nSupport at apple.com/support\n\nObviously, I can't walk into an Apple Store without them turning me away once they find out I'm jailbroken.\nThe most confusing part is whenever I plug my iPhone into my iMac, the computer fails to recognize it in any form or shape. It's not even charging the device, let alone acknowledging it in iTunes.\nRight now, I'm extremely afraid that I've been locked out of activating my phone because I'm jailbroken. I don't know what to do, and my LAST RESORT is to do any kind of force-resetting that would require me to update to iOS 7.\niOS 7 eats my battery life and would essentially require me to get a new phone with how I use my device, so I consider any kind of restore an absolute LAST RESORT.\nHopefully it's an easier issue to solve than that.\nIf any more information is required, I will happily provide.\nEdit #1\nI tried seeing if I could rerun the process from p0sixspwn, but as soon as I open v1.0.7 of the app (freshly downloaded one hour ago), it tells me the attached device is unsupported, even when there's nothing there?\n\n\nA: I had the same exact problem today. I didn't want to update to iOS 7 either, but after so many hours on google, this seemed the only way to make my phone useful again. I followed this http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1808 and although it made me have to lose my familiarity with iOS 6 (RIP), my phone is useful again.\n", "Q: Profiling Time Machine on OS/X Mavericks I know that it's possible to end up wasting a lot of space in Time Machine with backing up huge files that have changed only a little (like a Parallels image that is not optimized for time machine) and it seems to me possible that there are also some cases in which one gets lots of little files that are constantly changing or coming and going, like a web cache would do if Time Machine weren't already configured to refrain from backing the cache up.\nApparently there is or was a bug in Chrome that causes such issues.\nIs there a tool out there that can detect if I'm wasting a bunch of space somewhere? To detect big files it might tell me (Total space dedicated to versions of file X) - (space required for latest version of file X); there might be a more complicated analogue for directories.\n\nA: The two best tools I have discovered are tmutil which is bundled with OS X and BackupLoupe which is excellent software for deeply inspecting your backups.\nI would start with the graphical program BackupLoupe and try out a command like tmutil compare to see what Apple's tools provide to show you what will be part of the next backup interval.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S speaker not working for apps but works for ringer I have an iPhone 4S and the speakers are not working for applications. The speaker works when doing voice calls on speaker phone, adjusting the ringer, and other default things.\nHowever, when trying to have audio for YouTube and other applications it does not work.\nIt wasn't working for IOS 6.1.3 and I have now upgraded it to 7.0.4 with no luck. I then restored again with no luck.\nI believe the fact that it works for the speaker phone and ringtone would suggest it is not a hardware problem but a software problem.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I had this very same issue, after some research on the Apple Discussions forums I found out that it was due to either the docking connector at at the bottom or the headphone port either needing to be cleaned or that one or both may have been damaged. If you have tried using headphones and can adjust the sound with headphones in this would lead me to believe that this is indeed the most likely scenario.\nIn my case it was likely to be water related (as my flatmate didn't screw the top on the water bottle in my gym bag and the water got in my phone). If it has been water damaged then you might be able to get some of the water out using silica gel (available on Amazon). Place the silica gel around the powered down phone and seal tightly and leave for at least 48hrs. This should absorb some of the water.\nIf the damage hasn't be caused by water, you could try cleaning the headphone port and dock connector. You can use a soft bristle toothbrush for the dock connector, again while the phone is off, and give it a decent clean, being careful not to press too hard. You could also use some alcohol here but be careful not to use too much.\nThe headphone connector can be cleaned using a Q-Tip and alcohol while the phone is off. It needs to be left to dry before turning it on again but it should clean up the headphone port nicely. \nIf none of this works then it is likely that there is something else wrong with the phone and it would probably be best to take it to Apple, or a third party repair company for them to have a look at it.\n\nA: Had this same issue due to exposure to water.  Dried out the device as best as i could.  Sound would still not work, expect for ringer.  I powered off the device, sprayed the docking connector with electrical contact cleaner, then took a piece of a business card with a small piece of paper towel over it and cleaned the docking connector.  After that, my volume controls and everything work as they should.\n\nA: Leaving your wifi and going outside to use cellular data seems to snap the sound back on, for me at least. It might also work in reverse--cellular to wifi.\n\nA: I had this issue on an iPhone 4S starting in March 2015 - as others note I thought was hardware as reinitialization of the phone did nothing but installation of iOS9 did fix it.\n\nA: Same thing happend with my phone too! Steam caused it! \nI kept my phone out in sun for approximately 5 hours, in switch off condition! Then again did the same thing next day! And it started working but after using it for 2-3 hours it started giving same problem! \nThen I kept in the rice jar (with rice, completely dipped in rice) for 48 hours!

However, having tried all the App Store search engines I know of (uQurey, AppShopper, AppAdvice, 148apps), it seems that none of them offer this kind of specific customised search.\nSo my question is whether there is an App Store search service that allows such specific queries as this.\n\nA: There is a way now: https://appapp.io/us/has_iap=false/search\n(Full disclosure - I made it)\n\nA: In short: No, there's currently no query for that.

February 2015, apps have to support 64 bit. Source: https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=10202014a. So, it will then be a requirement.\n\nA: 64-bit is a recommendation. Since not all devices run 64-bit, they must allow 32-bit apps on the App Store. Only when all devices run 64-bit can Apple enforce such a restriction, otherwise all new apps wouldn't work on older devices.\n\nA: According to an email from Apple today, 64-bit support will soon be required in new iOS apps and app updates.\nFeb. 1, 2015: New Apps\nJune 1, 2015: App Updates\n\nDear Developer,\nAs we announced in October, beginning February 1, 2015 new iOS apps submitted to the App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK. Beginning June 1, 2015 app updates will also need to follow the same requirements. To enable 64-bit in your project, we recommend using the default Xcode build setting of “Standard architectures” to build a single binary with both 32-bit and 64-bit code.\nIf you have any questions, visit the Apple Developer Forums.\nBest regards,\nApple Developer Technical Support\n\n\nA: iOS apps use universal binary. That means one app can contain both of 32-bit and 64-bit code. \n\n\n*\n\n*If your device supports 64-bit mode, then your app will be run in 64-bit mode which is a lot faster.\n\n*If your device supports only 32-bit mode, then 32-bit code will be run. \n\n*64-bit Apple processors all have 32-bit compatibility mode, so legacy apps (32-bit only) will just work.\n\n\nActually in 32-bit mode, there're two different 32-bit architectures, and Apple is dealing with them very smoothly. Most people don't even know there's different 32-bit modes.\nIf you're a user, you have nothing to care, and everything will just work.\nIf you're a developer, you code will just work unless you are using some unrecommended hacks.\n\nA: 64-bit is slowly becoming a strong recommendation. For example, the in-app bluetooth picker functionality is only supported on 64-bit devices when running a 64-bit binary. So if you want to use the in-app bluetooth picker, you must build for both 32-bit and 64-bit.\nNote that this bluetooth picker functionality is not new. It works just fine on 32-bit devices in a 32-bit app. But it will not work on 64-bit devices in a 32-bit app.\nI've gotten confirmation from Apple that they do not consider this a bug and it will not be fixed in iOS 8 GM. You must build for both 32-bit and 64-bit if you want this functionality on both 32-bit and 64-bit devices.\nSee the discussion here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/20402973/ipad-air-corebluetootherror-cancelling-picker-as-we-couldnt-communicate-wit\n", "Q: How to log system activity the whole day How can I log my Macs system activity the whole day (on OS X Mavericks)?

For example, you could create a graphic that consists of \"A. \", \"B. \", \"C. \", ... and then use those as your custom bullets.  Using graphics like this for custom bullets can cause difficulty if you want to update your slides in the future but don't have the original graphic file available.\n\nA: This answer was originally posted as an edit by @what to @nadynes answer.  I include it for completeness sake.\n\n@what writes:\nnadyne's answer gave me an idea how to solve this problem, so I'm attaching my solution to her answer. What I did was temporarily install the English version of Microsoft Office.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the Microsoft Office folder from the Applications folder of OS\nX to the trash and from there to some other place (like the\nDesktop). (You cannot directly move the Office folder elsewhere.\nDragging it will only create an alias.)\n\n*Go to\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/germany/mac/office-2011-digital-download\nand download the English version of Microsoft Office. You need your\nproduct key for this.\n\n*Install MS Office.\n\n*Open the new English version of PowerPoint and create a new document\nwith the ordered list, or open your existing document and create a\nnew or re-format an existing list. Save the document.\n\n*Close PowerPoint, move the (English) MS Office folder from the\nApplications folder to the trash and from there to a save place to\nstore it.\n\n*Drag and drop the old (German) MS Office folder back to the\nApplications folder.\n\n*Open your PP file in the German version of PowerPoint. Voila, you\nhave a list with capital letter numberging :-) You can even copy\nthis list to other places in your document and edit the text. It\nwill retain the capital letters.\n\n\nHere is an image of the result. Note how the Numbering format menu does not offer the option for capital letters followed by a dot (\"A.\"), but the list in the open document is nevertheless numbered in that way:\n\nNotes: Office apps don't open when they're outside the Applications folder under OS 10.9, so you cannot have two parallel working installations but have to drag the MS Office folders around. You have to do a complete Office installation. Installing only the English version of PowerPoint into the German version of the MS Office folder will cause PP to crash upon startup. Also, the Office installer does not allow to choose a different place for installation, you have to install to the Applications folder. So move the German version before you install the English one.\nThe whole procedure including writing this edit took me 59 minutes (that's the time from my last comment to this edit). Next time will be much quicker, because I don't have to search, download and install MS Office or write an edit on Stackexchange :-)\n", "Q: Mac OSX Virtual box running appliance copied from Windows I had to work out of the office today and brought a copy of the Windows 2000 appliance I have on my Windows 7 machine at the office.\nCopied this to the Mac I am now on (Mavericks) and copied the files into the /Users/myUserName/VirtualBox VMs directory.\nAdded the host-only adapter to the VB preferences and then added this to the network for the specific machine.\nWhen running the virtual machine I boots and then fails with\nFailed to open a session for the virtual machine Win2000ServerAdv.\n\nNonexistent host networking interface, name 'VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter' (VERR_INTERNAL_ERROR).\n\nResult Code: NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)\nComponent: Console\nInterface: IConsole {8ab7c520-2442-4b66-8d74-4ff1e195d2b6}\n\nNow I am no netowkring expert but my guess is that issue lies with the fact that 'VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter'is the name of the adapter on Windows and on a Mac this gets named to 'vboxnet0'.\nIs there a simple work around for this poosibly, I thought there would have been a way to rename the vboxnet0 adapter name to 'VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter' but cannot see anything for this, not even in the command line tools.\nAny help in this regard would be great, or a simply 'No it cant be done' would be helpful.\nTa\nJohn\n\nA: From https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/7067:\nOn Linux I had to manually create the vboxnet0 interface:\n$ vboxmanage hostonlyif create\nthen manually edit each .vbox file and change all lines:\n<HostOnlyInterface name=\"VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter\"/>\n\nto\n<HostOnlyInterface name=\"vboxnet0\"/>\n\n", "Q: MBA doesn't see SSD. How do I recover my files? I have a 1.5 y.o. Macbook Air A1466. Today i left it turned on on charger and went to work. Got home and found it hung. Reboot with powerbutton resulted in a question mark of death.\nI tried disconnecting all cables, did PRAM reset and tried internet recovery.\nThere's simply no SSD in the disk utility, only a recovery partition.\nHardware test showed no errors, but had no single mention of hard drive either.\nI had no backup (I know).\nIs there any way to recover my data? Is this something apple geniuses will be able to help with?\nLaptop still under warranty, but Im worried about files on the HD. Are they gone forever?\nEDIT:\nVisited genius bar today - they ran a couple of tests and said that SSD is dead. All other components passed the tests. They recommend I contact a 3rd party data recovery company and agreed to replace the disk under warranty after recovery is done.\nThey won't give me back the faulty disk, but would sell it to me for $545+GST - price of a new working SSD if bought from them.\n(This is the hard way to learn importance of periodic backups. Easy way - learn from my mistakes).\n\nA: More than likely the files ARE recoverable but the difficulty & cost to do so could either be a little or a lot.  My first step would be to start a case with Apple, either by calling AppleCare (1-800-APL-CARE), visiting an Apple Retail Store’s Genius Bar (be sure to make an appointment beforehand) or an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP).  This link can help you find an Apple Store or AASP in your area.  \nWith the age of your Mac and the issue you describe it might be tied to the MacBook Air SSD REP that Apple announced a few months ago.  Once they evaluate the issue, which will likely be fairly quick since it's possibly a known issue, they can provide you with info on repairing the Mac and recovering the data.  Apple’s policies prevent their staff from assisting (aside from recommendations) with data recovery but AASPs may be able to provide onsite data recovery or more budget friendly recommendations.\nThe only other thing you might attempt on your own before seeking data recovery from a specialist is to try and browse your Mac from another Mac.  You can do this by using Target Disk Mode, which is triggered by holding T while powering on your MacBook Air. Once it’s in Target Disk Mode you can connect it to another Mac using a Firewire (with Thunderbolt adapter for your Mac) or Thunderbolt cable.  A functioning drive would then show up in the secondary Mac’s OS as an external hard drive.\nBeyond that your best bet is consulting your local AASP and/or AppleStore for data recovery recommendations.\n", "Q: How can I launch .sh scripts from the finder in iTerm2 instead of Terminal?

I have read everywhere that you need to backup your private keys for iOS Developer Certificates on your Mac. I want to know if public key is important to backup or not. In case if a person just keeps backup of Private keys of all certificates, can public keys be recovered on new OS installation using those old private keys? Or in other words, can I re-use those old backup certificates successfully? So Does it really matter if I do not backup public keys?\nMay be it's a lame Question, but I want to know about it. Thanks for helping me out..\n\nA: There's no need of backing up the Public Key as it is in the actual Certificate, which can be easily downloaded from the iOS Dev Center.  \nWhen you manually generate a Certificate, you firstly need to generate a Certificate Signing Request through the Keychain Access application. When this is done, both Public and Private keys are generated. The private one is automatically saved into your Mac, whilst the public key is included in the CSR file sent to the Provisioning Authority. One of the items contained in the generated certificate sent back from the Provisioning Authority will be this public key.\n\nA: Yes, it does matter. You can backup if you want to, but I would say it's important. \nhttp://iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-tutorials/90538-critical-back-up-your-developer-key.html\n", "Q: Problem while trying to export iTunes library to an xml file (on OS X 10.8, iTunes 11.1.3) Short version: When I try to export iTunes library to an xml file, iTunes creates a temporary file (called iTunes export.tmp) and it quickly disappears and I don't get any xml file...\nLong version: I have partitioned my HD and made a clean Mavericks install on the second partition. In order to migrate my iTunes library, I've moved the media files to an external HD ('cause the second partition is too small to contain them) and iTunes keeps working fine on Mountain Lion. Now I'm trying to export my library from Mountain Lion and import on Mavericks. When I finish the tests with Mavericks, I'll probably keep it and drop Mountain Lion (if all the apps I use work fine on Mavericks, I'm testing now). It would be really great if I could keep all the metadata on my iTunes library after the migration...\nIs there any other way to migrate my iTunes library? or maybe something I could do to fix this issue with the xml export?\n\nA: I've managed to solve the main reason I was asking this question... (Although I couldn't make Export Library work from iTunes on my Mountain Lion partition)\nI booted into Mavericks and then I copied the iTunes folder from Mountain Lion partition to the Mavericks one and it worked as expected... :-)\nMy library is migrated, including play counts, playlists, album arts, ratings... Well, it's all there.\nNote: The iTunes is up to date on both partitions (version 11.1.3).\nNote 2: In order to migrate my iOS devices' backups, I also copied from Mountain Lion to Mavericks the folder ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync.\nI'm still curious why export library was not working, but my problem is gone.\n", "Q: How much does replacing the screen of iPod touch 4th gen cost in India?

I normally don't reboot my computer and can leave it logged in for days on end.  I decided to reboot my computer and when it was booting, the screen backlight would not turn on, although I could faintly see the login screen where I could type my password.\nI tried resetting the SMC, but that didn't do anything.\nI also tried resetting the PRAM, but I'm guessing because I have a firmware password and the computer is FileVault-encrypted, instead of actually resetting the PRAM, I have the prompt to type in my firmware password (also really faint since the backlight isn't on).  If I type in my password, it boots into the recovery partition and the display backlight finally turns on. However upon reboot, the backlight will stop working again.\nI tried using Disk Utility to check for any permissions/disk errors but didn't find any issues.\nI haven't tried logging in with the faint login screen, only because I can't find my mouse cursor to select my account to login.  I've tried rebooting with both the power cable connected and disconnected.\nHow can I get my screen backlight to turn back on again?\n\nA: I had the same problem. The dimmed screen happened during the reboot after turning on file vault. I was able to solve the problem by going into a darkroom. This allowed me to see the cursor and to log in to an account. Once I logged in the back light came on and everything was fine. \nI had first tried to solve the problem by zapping the pram.

Boot with ⌘⌥R until you get the spinning globe, then follow the instructions. This should download a new Recovery HD which you should be able to use to reinstall OS X.\n\nA: What you can do is:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Boot in Recovery Mode / to Recovery HD \n  \n*Delete / Format your Hard Drive\n  \n*Boot your Mac and you should be forced to download and install OS X\n  \n\nEverything what holds you back from reinstalling OS X can only be on your \"real\" hard drive, and not on your RecoveryHD.

In the printing preview, I saw those highlights, which I didn't really want for the printed document. I tried to disable the highlights but didn't find such an option, and ended up removing all the highlights before printing. So, does such an option (hiding highlights for printing) exist in Preview at all? Thanks.\nBy the way, I'm using Preview 7.0 (826) on OS X 10.9.1.\n\nA: In Preview.app there isn't an option, although there is a way:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open your .pdf document \n  \n*Select All (Command A)\n  \n*Everything should be highlighted\n  \n*Control mouse click on any page\n  \n*From the popup menu > select the circle with a slash through it\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n*Print your document\n  \n*Press Command Z to undo (re-enable highlights)\n  \n\n\nA: There is a slightly complicated way that still works: go to the top menu Tools and open Inspector. A small window pops up, select the icon at the far right in the window ('Annotations Inspector').\nIn the list of all annotations select one and press command+a (select all) and then delete (backspace) to delete all annotations.\nAfter printing (without closing the document in between!) you can get your annotations back through command+z (undo) - for this it should not matter if the inspector is selected or the main preview window.\nI found the guide here in this five year old post here: https://protips.maxmasnick.com/preview-dot-app-remove-all-highlights-and-annotations-quickly\nBut it still works now (version 10.1).\nEdit: Just found out - with this method you actually have to scroll down the document and repeat the deletion steps for every page.\n\nA: There no easy way to do this with Preview as of v8. You should request the feature with Apple.\nThe best way to do this is to print the PDF with Acrobat instead. I'm testing with Acrobat Standard Pro v10.1. There, in the print dialog, you can can choose to print only the document or the document with markup. \n\nThe solution by I'L'I will only remove highlights in Preview but not comments.

To for example relaunch TextEdit if it is quit, you can save this plist as /Library/LaunchAgents/relaunchtextedit.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>relaunchtextedit</string>\n  <key>Program</key>\n  <string>/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit</string>\n  <key>KeepAlive</key>\n  <true/> <!-- run the program again if it is terminated -->\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/> <!-- run the program at login -->\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nMake sure the file is owned by root. Then run sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/relaunchtextedit.plist or log out and back in to load the plist. (You could also save the plist in the user library, but then the user can unload it without having to enter a password.)\n\nA: the only way i could solve it was adding a rule to the sudoers file, allowing to run the app without password. to reduce the security risks, all the files used by the app are owned by and could only be edited by run by the root user.\n", "Q: Corsair Vengeance 2100 on OS X I just purchased the Crosair Vengeance 2100 headset to use with Steam on OS X (Mountain Lion) and to use with Skype. \nI can get the headset to be detected by OS X and set it up as a sound device but after a few minutes the audio and mic cut out with the only way to reset it is to pull the USB adapter out and put it back in (and then go reset the output devices in OS X). \nHas anyone been able to get it to properly work on OS X? \nThanks. \n\nA: Are you using it wireless or plugged in? \nIf you are wireless, I'll bet they're low on charge. If you look where the cord connects, it's likely blinking or solid red (which means you need to charge them).\nAs for the adapter, you don't need to keep un-plugging to reset them. On the left ear, you press the button for a few seconds. This will re-sync the headset to your USB adapter. If it correctly sync'ed, the blinking blue light on the adapter will stop blinking on stay solid.\n", "Q: Manually setting backup points - alternatives to Time Machine Time Machine automatically takes backups every hour of the last day, every day of the last month, etcetera.\nI just finished setting up a new Mavericks installation, and turned it on.\nIt took one snapshot. 22 gigs. But then one hour later it took another one. Another 22 gigs.\n\nWhat a waste of space! I didn't even touch my computer in between these two backups(even though my MacBook does seem to have doodled half a gig into existence).\nThis is horrible! All it is doing is copying my entire filesystem into a folder on my harddrive.  I can do that myself!  And then I can do it at sensible junctures.\nFor example, let's say I'm going to evaluate a dozen text editors, some of which I need to compile from the command line, involving homebrew, Mac Ports, filling my file system with nonsense that very possibly isn't going to get removed cleanly.\nSo I would first backup, try all the competitors out, then revert and install the winner, and take another backup.\nAs far as I can see, I can just create a folder on my external hard drive and drag drop my filesystem into it.  Then I should be able to, from within disk utility, \"restore from Time Machine backup\" and just select the folder.\nThis has the added bonus that I can create sensible folder names for my various backups.\nCan anyone confirm, can I do this? Is there a better way?\nEDIT: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync\n\nA: Because of the way TimeMachine has saved the data, you don't actually have two copies.  It just seems that each backup is a full set of files (which it is; but, in the background there is some nifty unix filesystem \"trickery\" going on).\nIf you go to the enclosing folder (π's MacBook Air) or the top-level of the hard drive itself, you should see around 22GB used there, and not 44GB.\n(Edit)\nAs for dragging/dropping, unless you do it as the root user, some files will not be copied into your destination folder, due to permission issues.  And, copying large amounts of data via Finder can strain your CPU and your patience.\nRsync is a better alternative than drag/drop.  And, if your goal is to set a bookmark for your file system to revert to after experimenting with text editors and what-not, it might actually be better than Time Machine.  Time Machine is good for recovering accidentally deleted files; but, if you want to return the computer to a previous state, you would have to \"restore\" the complete old Applications/ folder, just to \"remove\" the new files added there that you don't want anymore.  Rsync would make that a little more amenable.\n", "Q: Fast screen sharing Ok, so, I want to buy a Mac Mini with OS X server. I want to run it without any monitor, or keyboards, or mouse. Now, I want to control it remotely from my MacBook via Screen Sharing. Since I have another MacBook in the family, I tested Screen Sharing to see if it works well. When I tested this on my house's current network configuration (A single router, and the two MacBooks connected to this router), I noticed the screen sharing was  kind of slow. So I created a peer to peer network between the two computers, and tested screen sharing again. Using the peer to peer network, it runs a lot faster. So, is it possible to kind of directly and wirelessly connect my MacBook and the Mac Mini, and connect to the Wi-Fi internet at the same time, or something that would make screen sharing faster? (Also notice I can't connect the Mac Mini to the internet via ethernet in my bedroom)\n\nA: Ok, so now I have the Mac Mini as a server, and I tried to configure the network in the way I wanted to. From my google searches I've found that the Mac mini can't connect to a Wi-Fi router and be a Wireless router at the same time. But I have a good solution... I have my Mac mini connected to the Wireless router, and I bought an Ethernet cable, that I eventually use to connect my MacBook directly to the Mac Mini for faster screen sharing. Using this direct connection through the Ethernet cable makes screen sharing pretty fast... I mean, it's NOT 100% perfect, but you can control the computer quite smoothly if you are using the \"Adaptive quality\" configuration found in the menu bar of the screen sharing app.\n", "Q: AirPlay Music From AirPort Express Dropping Out My AirPlay music keeps disconnecting.

This happens if I stream from my iPhone or MacBook\n\n\nWhat can I try to prevent the AirPlay music from dropping out?\n\nA: I have struggled with a similar issue for about a year now. Under the veil of secrecy, I think that airplay is a solid protocol.\nI use an AT&T Arris Gateway for a DHCP server with an Airport Express as a LAN node. Here's what seems to have solved my problem:\nDeep inside the configuration pages for my Arris router (Firewall > Advanced) I found a \"Flood Limit\" option, which was stated to block \"bursting new traffic.\" Essentially, the router was dropping packets after a certain limit had been reached (I believe this is a mechanism against DoS attacks). Disabling this seemed to stop the AirPlay from dropping out.\nLong story short, you may have a router that is tampering too much with the packets on your LAN. Go through every setting on your routers/APs. Disable MAC address filtering, make sure these TCP/UDP ports are open, and steer clear of firewall features that are degrading the performance of your network. Also, wired connections between APs really help with streaming.\n\nA: This is a design bug in my opinion. Apple doesn't buffer enough data to accommodate the tuning and performance of most hardware it ships.\nI've filed several bugs with Apple in the last few years and none have been followed up on, so either they think things are fine or haven't heard from enough users. I have found iOS is less likely to skip than OS X of late, so when I really need to have music playing without skipping, I've fired my Mac from that job (sadly) since it can't perform this task well.\n", "Q: eclipse wrong VM related to java 1.7 So I have been searching for hours on this. \nSo I installed java 1.7 on my mac before I realized I wanted/needed to use 1.6.

In Mac Outlook 2011, when I type a message that contains an apostrophe or a quotation mark, Outlook corrects it to a \"smart\" apostrophe or a \"smart\" quotation mark, and I'd rather it didn't. \nIs there any way to disable this feature? So far, I've unchecked all the autocorrect and autoformat preferences, and I've set my composition settings to plain text and my encoding settings to UTF-8 (two suggestions I saw elsewhere). None of those worked. \nWhat else should I try?\n\nA: You can turn Smart Quotes off by unchecking \"Smart Quotes\" under Edit > Substitutions > Smart Quotes\n\nA: The Mac has global settings for smart quotes. Even if you click them off in Outlook's Edit > Substitutions menu, you may still get them in your email. \nWith an email open, go\nEdit > Substitutions > Show Substitutions > Text Preferences\n\nthat takes you straight to the global\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Text\n\nwhere there is a global option to turn smarties off.  You may also be able to go directly to System Prefs from the Finder, and they may stick in Outlook.  I am hedging because I remember doing this a while back, but I just checked and they're magically turned back on.  I don't know when or how that might have happened.  One must be ever-vigilant against attacks of the Zombie Smart Quotes!\n\nA: The latest version of Outlook now overrides the system default mentioned above.

I would like to get the sound from my MacBook Pro to play on my iPhone. For example if I watch a video on my Mac I would be able to view it on my Mac but get the audio through my iPhone. Is this possible?\n\nA: Yes, you can do it.\nYou need to be on the same WiFi network and use a pair of matched applications on your Mac and iPhone.\nThe best known of these are Airfoil (for the Mac) and Airfoil Speakers Touch on your iPhone. See this: http://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/\nNote that Airfoil Speakers Touch does not turn your iPhone into Airplay speakers so you can only stream to it from a computer running Airfoil and not, for example, your iPad.\n\nA: Yes, you can do this with Airplay if jailbroken.\nIf your application cannot do this by default, you could use a program like AirFoil / AirFoil Speakers - you only have to be connected on the same wifi network.\nThis is something I use in my own situation.\n", "Q: Must I log in upon connecting to a computer via VNC?

In the early versions of Mac OS X, only the first 8 characters of any password was used. Later Apple increased that number.\nA proper password system stores a hash not the actual password. In that case, a longer password/passphrase is generally better so as to increase the chance of a generating a hash value not already pre-calculated. I assume Apple is using this hash technique for authenticating system login users.\nIt Mavericks, what is the maximum number of characters in a passphrase used by Apple's user account login?\n\nA: I tested passwords up to 480 characters (in OS X version 10.8.5) and it used all of them; around 480 the passwd command had a little trouble setting passwords, but it was slightly inconsistent, so I'm not sure if that's a real limit. I didn't test with the System Prefs interface, because it doesn't allow pasting passwords, and there's no way I'm typing something that long (twice!). Basically, it'll use as much as you can stand to type.\n\nA: The (salted and stretched) hash of the login password is stored in /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/username.plist in 10.7 and later. If you're worried that someone can read the hash (by for example starting up in single user mode) and then use a cracking tool like DaveGrohl to figure out the password, OS X has used PBKDF2 since 10.8, which limits cracking tools to about ten guesses per second per core.\nIt took about ten minutes to guess a random three character password on my iMac:\n$ sudo dave -u $USER\n-- Loaded PBKDF2 (Salted SHA512) hash...\n-- Starting attack\n\n-- Found password : 'y8d'\n-- (incremental attack)\n\nFinished in 879.274 seconds / 31,385 guesses...\n35 guesses per second.\n\nUnless you perform a distributed attack, it's currently impractical to crack even a random eight character password that consists of lowercase ASCII letters and ASCII numbers. At 40 guesses per second, it would take about 36^8/40/(86400*365) ≈ 2000 years to test all options.\n\nA: Actually storing hashes is a TERRIBLE way to \"securely\" store passwords. By nature hashes are impossible to \"reverse\", but that does not stop one from generating a large table (called a rainbow table) that stores plaintext-hash pairs. With this table it's possible to lookup a hash and see it's associated plaintext password(s).\nThe accepted way of storing passwords is the hash and salt method. A salt is a random, large string that is combined with the password before a hash is calculated. This makes the input of the hash too big to be feasibly pre-calculated in a rainbow table. In the end, the only things stored in a proper password database are hashes and salts (the salts can be stored in plaintext, since they aren't at all helpful to reversing the hashes).\nBasically, you don't need to have a long password to protect from rainbow table attacks, since salts do that for you.\nComputerphile made a great YouTube Video on storing passwords.\nAs far as making secure password goes, one of the best approaches is to use 4-6 medium length, unrelated, REAL words (without the need for symbols/numbers). This ensures a sufficiently long password, that isn't easily guessed, and is most importantly memorable (so you'll never be tempted to write it on a sticky note).\nTL;DR:\n\n", "Q: Emacs crashes on Mac OS X with \"Dispatch Thread Hard Limit Reached\" Emacs crashes on me once a day or so with the same error message in the dump:\n\nDispatch Thread Hard Limit Reached: 512 (too many dispatch threads blocked in synchronous operations)\n\nGoogle shows this causes many programs on Mac OS X to crash, so I don't think it's specific to Emacs.

Great for saving space by rough cutting your large video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. It lets you quickly extract the good parts from your videos and discard many gigabytes of data without doing a slow re-encode and thereby losing quality. It extremely fast because it does an almost direct data copy. It is fueled by the awesome ffmpeg (included) for doing the grunt work. It also features some other lossless operations on videos.\n\nIn the screenshot I've selected 3 trim regions. When I press E, each section is sliced and saved to its own video file.

With professional quality editing, you can export the files as a higher, lower, or in the same format as before. To use the editor, you can use the blade tool in the non-linear editor to cut parts of the video, or to change the 2.1 surroundsound to 5.1. It also has a multiformat timeline. \nDaVinci Resolve 11 - There are three versions of this software. DaVinci Resolve Lite ($0). Davinci Resolve Software ($995), or Davinci Resolve ($29,995)\nThis is some of the best software to date. Known for its color correction capabilities, DaVinci Resolve will allow for multi format editing, has many transitioning capabilities, keyframing, awesome plugins, collaboration features, and the ability to go from mac to Windows. It will also allow for you to upgrade your surround sound, and allows for re-framing, and does not create proxy media. For precision editing, and for non-3d video the lite version is for you. 8GB of RAM is recommended.\nBoth of these products allow for non-linear editing and abilities to upgrade your media to an uncompressed format for faster export to DVD. \n\nA: I made a graphical tool that uses ffmpeg to let you losslessly trim videos by selecting the start and end points on the timeline:\nhttps://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut\nIt is open source and cross platform.\n\nA: iMovie (not lossless, but better than before)\niMovie v10 (released some time after the question was originally asked) now better handles more media types, so avoids the import re-encode for most H.264 (mp4, m4v, mov, AVHDC, mts, mt2s) content.\nIt will still, however, re-encode on export so cannot be technically lossless—another new feature, however, is the ability to customise the export quality, which can be closer-to-lossless. I suspect this part of the answer can apply equally to other 'project driven' video editing software (e.g. Premiere or Final Cut) because I think they all generally re-encode on output, though are usually very easy to use for precise trimming.\nPersonally, I generally think a single re-encode isn't a huge problem, but understand you did specifically ask for a lossless solution, so...\nLossless (but way more complicated!)\nThere are technical limitations as to how precisely you can cut a video without having to re-encode at least some part of it, and it basically depends on the i-frame frequency. If every frame is an i-frame, you can cut anywhere, but if they're only every few seconds, then you can only cut losslessly at those i-frames without losing content or having to re-encode (at least part of the stream) so it can start with an i-frame.\nffmpeg\nThis SO Q&A specifically raises the question of how to cut between i-frames using ffmpeg. I don't know of any GUI apps to do this, but basically you run a command something like the following:\nffmpeg -i input.m4v -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss 00:01:20.000 -t 00:37:50.000 output.m4v\n\nThe two times specified are start and duration, and can be specified either as seconds or hh:mm:ss.ss, and the -acodec copy and -vcodec copy tell ffmpeg not to re-encode.\nI'm not exactly sure what happens if you cut too early, but I think the video is essentially blank (or maybe corrupt, depending on player) until it encounters an i-frame. So you'll probably want to find the nearest i-frame before your cut. This answer solves that problem using ffprobe and awk, albeit a little awkwardly. Essentially you use ffprobe to scan the frames and find the nearest keyframe (flags=K) before your ideal cut-point. Full output for each frame of the video can be seen like this:\nffprobe -select_streams v -show_frames <INPUT>\n\nThe linked answer supplies this command to find a keyframe before a specific time:\nffprobe -select_streams v -show_frames -v quiet INPUT.mp4 | \nawk -F= ' \n  /pict_type=/ { if (index($2, \"I\")) { i=1; } else { i=0; } } \n  /pkt_pts_time/ { if (i && ($2 >= 150)) print $2; }  \n' | head -n 1\n\nAnd finally, if you really need to cut somewhere between two i-frames, you can split the video and re-join. Based on the info from this answer, it should be something like:\nffmpeg -f concat -i list_of_videos.txt -c copy OUTPUT.mp4\n\nWhere list_of_videos.txt is a simple text file listing the files you want to concatenate.\nSummary\niMovie is probably good enough for most cases (since v10), and very easy.\nffmpeg can do it losslessly (or very close to losslessly), with a bit of fiddling; level of difficulty depends on how picky you are about the precise starting point, and frequency of i-frames.\n\nA: You should be able to toggle between frames in Quicktime Pro with the arrow keys. It's certainly not as easy as using Avid, Final Cut, Premiere, etc. but it's doable. You can make your Marks move with the arrow keys, too.\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure if this is lossless, but (on Big Sur, I don't know about Catalina and before), but if you want to simply trim video Quick Look has a simple video trimmer that allows you to replace existing video or create a new video in the original format.\n", "Q: How to run programs from an external hard drive on MacBook Pro? I need to know how to install and run applications from an external hard drive on my MacBook Pro.\n\nA: You just need to copy the application to the external drive. Mac apps can actually run from anywhere, it is merely convention to keep them in the /Applications folder.\nOf course all the preferences will still be in your home Library folder but the app will be on the external drive.\n\nA: It is possible (with conditions). You need to take care of:\n\n*\n\n*The external drive must be formatted in some Apple/Mac Filesystem like HFS+ or APFS. If you try to run those external apps from an exFAT or some other non-Apple/non-Mac file system, macOS will complain about a \"corrupt or broken\" app, even though the app itself would be totally fine.\n\n\n*Be careful when the apps on the external drive want to self-update. Those updates may or may not land in the Application folder on the main mac drive (and not the external drive).\n\n\n*Unlike the .apps applications which you can just drag and drop out of your Applications folder onto an external drive, some apps have installers instead (e.g. often the ones where the setup comes with .pkg extensions, and NOT .dmg extensions). Those often want to install themselves on the disk where the macOS itself also resides (e.g. Labview, MacTeX, R).\n\n\n*Some apps, even though they may say that they have an \"installation path\" option (e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio), they still install 90% of their stuff onto the main drive where macOS resides. So you earn next to nothing from using an external drive for such apps.\nThe following are not deal breakers and are self-obvious but just to be complete:\n\n*\n\n*Speed could be an issue, in general. Some apps might behave sloppy.\n\n\n*You can use the apps only as long as you have the external drive. (Convenience factor?)\n\n\n*For some apps, even on an HFS+/APFS formatted disk, the macos throws an error that the app cannot be verified. You can still go to the Settings->Security/Privacy->General and launch the app anyway though. Depends on how you feel about that viz-e-viz security, app-verification, etc.\n\n\n*Macbooks (especially the newer models) have fewer ports (USB, SDCard, etc). I have not tested it (cause thankfully my macbook is old and hence has enough ports), but I can imagine that the performance of an external drive connected to a shared USB port over an external Dongle or USB hub would suffer when other USB devices also want a piece of the action with the macbook, over that USB port.\np.s. like the Answer from Tony mentions, this all affects only the executables. The preferences, etc don't get moved (with exceptions again! I noticed the Tor Browser puts its data right there on the external drive. But then again Tor Browser is aiming for something else than most other apps).\nLast word: For convenience' sake, one can even make links to the external apps from the Applications folder, like so:\n$ cd /Applications\n$ ln -s /Volumes/<EXTERNAL DRIVE NAME>/dosbox.app dosbox.app\n\nand henceforth you can launch those apps from the Launchpad.\n", "Q: App Store notifications regarding price drops? I've placed a few apps on my Wish List in the (iOS) App Store.\nWill I get some kind of automatic notification in case of a price drop? Or: Can I make it so, without using a third party app?\n\nA: You can do it via the web site AppShopper. Sign up for a free account to get started.\nWhile it can't read your Apple wish list, you can create a wish list on that site and it will notify you of price drops of your wish list items via email. It will also email you about updates for your wish list and your \"My Apps\" list. Personally I don't keep any apps in \"My Apps\" list, since Apple updates them for me every night on all of my devices.\nI have no professional affiliation with this web site. I'm just a satisfied user.\n\nNote: Checking \"Notify me of price drops by E-mail\" and unchecking \"Share My Wishlist\" on the Wish List page of AppShopper didn't seem to be \"remembered\" by the site (perhaps due to my browser settings), but it does work on the My Profile page.\n", "Q: How to prevent CMD key in Parallels Desktop 9 from switching to Windows 8 start screen?

It came with Snow Leopard but I upgraded a few times since I bought it. I have deauthorized, reformatted and reinstalled OS X on my mac following the instructions here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht5189\nWhen I reinstalled, it installed Mountain Lion (not Snow Leopard) and asked me for my iTunes account to verify that I purchased Mountain Lion. I used Command-Q to quit after the install, so it is at the factory default welcome screen at the moment.\nMy question: if I sell it, is my iTunes account tied to the computer now since it asked for that during installation? And if so, is it possible to return it to an identity-free state to sell?\n\nA: I just saw this article this morning that might be helpful: How to Prepare a MacBook Pro For Sale that was Upgraded to Mavericks by Scott Williams\n\nA: As to whether the Apple ID persists on the reinstalled drive using the approach I did: I don't know.\nA better way is probably to install Mavericks from a USB thumb drive, described here:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=18081307&postcount=3\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app --nointeraction\n\nAssuming \"Install OS X Mavericks.app\" is in your Applications folder and your thumbdrive is called \"Untitled\".\n", "Q: OS X Empty Trash is deleting all files on computer I'm using a MacBook Pro, Snow Leopard. I hit secure empty trash on the Finder menu. It took a while to get the thing done, so I just thought \"wow, this musta been one fat trash can\".\nThe next day, I found that all my folders were empty. The folders themselves were in the right places, but all the files gone! \nI went crazy wondering what had happened and eventually looked in the trash can, and surprise, all the 20.000+ files in my computer were there. Lots of work re-arranging them.\nNow, every time I try to securely empty the trash can, although it contains only about 1.700 files, that little \"calculating trash can files\" thingy shoots up to 30.000 and tries to delete all my files!\nCurrent situation: cannot delete content of trash can without deleting content of computer as a whole. Any suggestions?\n\nA: So what is SOUNDS like is there is some serious directory corruption going on with your system.\nFIRST make a backup. use disk utility to clone the drive to an image on an external drive, or Carbon Copy Cloner or some such.\nBoot your system from the Snow Leopard Install disk and once you select the language to use go to the menu at the top of the screen (Tools?) and select Disk Utility.\nOnce that is up click on your hard drive and repair it. Then do it again. It could take a while. It is also possible that it won't be able to fix it, but at least you know.\nIf it won't fix it, my go to Disk repair utility is DiskWarrior. you can buy it online and create a bootable repair disk (note that booting from the DW CD is very slow. 10+ minutes to boot) and let DW do it's thing. And if DW cant repair it you may have to repartition/reformat.\nAgain, I cant stress enough the importance of backing up everything that you can, even if you have to just drag the files you need from your internal HD to an external one.\nFailing all of that, verify your backup is working and then boot from the installer again and delete the old partition, create a new one and format it. Install the O/S from scratch, apply updates and then restore your files.\nNot much fun but if you can get your needful files off the computer quite fixable.\nOh just thought of one more thing...\nIf you go the reformat route and it won't partition or reformat then the drive is probably dying, time to replace it. \n", "Q: A REAL iTunes server on NAS I am certainly not the only one dealing with the issue (looking into questions here which deal with some aspects related to an iTunes Server or looking at the Apple Support Forum). So I ask:\nWhat is a way of having a real (explanation of real follows) iTunes Server on a NAS?\nDriving force of course is the desire to centralize my iTunes Library, photos, big data, that I do not want to carry around with my me. Solution: A Network Attached Storage (NAS). For all the other stuff except the iTunes library this solution is great. Of course I can put the library on it BUT: \n\n\n*\n\n*I will not be able to stream content to my iDevice directly (I could if my Mac is, but not directly)\n\n*I cannot tell my library to stream some music to an AirPlay device from my iDevice (again, only if my Mac is on)\n\n*In principle: Without any other device(s) running, my library can do nothing. It is not stand alone! To stream content requires additional devices running.\n\n\nAny NAS that can store any of my data (ok that's every NAS :)) and serves as a stand alone iTunes library I consider a real iTunes Server. I would consider it a real real iTunes Server if I can remote it via Apples Remote App and stream music/videos via Apple appropriate apps  (yes I kinda favor Apples solution whenever available).\nI will give myself an answer for one possibility (an additional Mac) with pros and mainly cons. But I am very interested in other solutions (please as well do not hide disadvantages from your proposed solutions)!\n\nA: One possibility: An additional Mac.\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*Could do everything asked for.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Expensive.\n\n*Power consuming.\n\n*To save some power, one would let it sleep. So everytime one wants to connect to the library, the Mac has to be waked up.\n\n*Setup not as easy as NAS.\n\n\nA: I have invested many many years into research and experiments on Entertainment Setups in Home Environments.\nGathering all my Knowledge, I will now try to answer your question, while explaining you, how you could do it and why.\nLet's Start with Apple. Apple is limiting iTunes heavily because of their own interests. iTunes Match is one of them.\nTo Stream Content to your iDevice, you need a Mac, iTunes, an AppleID and Home Sharing activated.\nOtherwise it won't work.\nIf you have all these things you can only do 1 thing : Stream Music. Nothing Less and nothing more. Simple, Stupid Streaming.\nStreaming Content from your Library via Airplay to iDevices.\nWell.. in theory iTunes could do it, but practically, it is not possible. Simple as that.\nAnd you are therefore totally right, when saying : Without any other Device, your iTunes Library won't even work at all.\nAnd even if it did with another Device/Machine, it wouldn't work either.\nNow we talk NAS.\nI have to admit, that the Synology DS have some good UIs for those things.\nBut if you want to do more than just sharing Music, you are pretty much stuck in the mud.\nSo how to go about it ?\nAt first, I would not recommend any of the Apple-Solutions. iTunes is a pain if you want to centralize it.\nBut it is indeed possible and here is my approach on how to do it :\nI have a 10 TB Self-Build Macintosh NAS System. But you could use a FreeNAS System as well. Or even a Ubuntu/Fedora Machine.\n(If you don't need iTunes)\nI have 6x2TB, 1xTB for the System and stuff, 5x2 TB in a ZFS RAID-Z Pool.\nI chose Subsonic for Streaming Music to computers, AudioTap (App for iDevices) for streaming Music to iDevices.\nEven though AudioTap is not developed any more, you can absolutely use it. You can Edit Playlists, Give ratings, and so on.\nI have a very clean and well Tagged Music Collection that is synced with Subsonic automatically and synced with iTunes Manually.\niTunes Sharing allows every Mac to simply connect to the Music, AudioTap is great for all the iDevices.\nBut you could also use Subsonic Clients as well.\nBut this is all Audio.\nFor Movies and TV-Shows I prefer Plex. And I have some Additional Apps/Clients as well.\nPlex could also handle Music, but I prefer Subsonic for that.\nPlex can be installed on every OS. Windows, Mac, Linux. Whatever you prefer.\nPlex can stream to any device, and you can control it from every Device.\nPlex automatically updates the Library if you change something. Plex can handle Playlists.\nBoth of the Solutions are free. Plex is Free and Subsonic is free (except for streaming to Devices). But you could\nuse Madsonic instead, which allows streaming without extra fees.\nIf you have time and Money, I would consider a Mac Mini (older model) in combination with attached Storage.\nYou can then install iTunes, Subsonic, Plex and many other Apps.\nYou could also install things like \"AirServer\", which extends you AirPlay needs.\nIn fact, the \"Media Centralization\" is very complicated, if you want to have a good Experience in the end.\nI've gone through all of it and even now I am not satisfied with the solution. But there is nothing else.\nAnd iTunes is in my view the worst.\nSpeaking of iPhoto. You could then also put an Instance of iPhoto onto your mac and Have some script for auto-adding pictures to the library.\nI use Piwigo for my Photo-Collection, but I am pretty sure there is something similar to \"Automatically add to iTunes\" for iPhoto.\nAll the Other Big Data can be stored on the Server too.\nSo that is maybe not the answer you wanted to hear, but there is no good way that I am aware of when using iTunes as a Media Server.\n\nA: There are in fact iTunes Servers on some NAS devices. All of these require iTunes to be running on a Mac or PC on the network as they don't have direct access. These will show up in iTunes as a network server. I have done some research as i already have the drives for a Netgear ReadyNAS and am waiting on delivery. The new range 100/300/500 series running OS6 all have the iTunes Server on them. I do not know at this stage whether the IOS remote will work with this Server, i certainly hope so, or what is the point. I will test it when received and get back to you. NAS devices are all DLNA enables so you can stream direct form any DLNA device, TV's etc. \n\nA: SyncPhoto is working well for me as an iPhoto solution.  It will keep all your iPhoto instances synced with each other.  I agree with Plex and have been using it for years.  Similar to XBMC but Plex has a central database server and it communicates to clients, iOS, OS X, Windows, Roku, ATV with some hacking, ....\n\nA: There is a simpler solution. You need a client that can render the video/audio.  The presumption is that you need an iTunes server to send the stream to the device.\nI use FileBrowser to render the video or audio directly to the device without my Mac delivering the stream.  FileBrowser gives you the ability to browse through the files on your NAS without iTunes.\nThere are probably other apps that will do the same functions.  By the way, FileBrowser also will AirPlay a file without iTunes as well. I am not getting any money for this, but FileBrowser does a lot more than just media rendering.\n\nA: The Outclass AppleTV server claims to support homesharing. I'm not sure if this is just secretly a Windows box running iTunes or where you even purchase one of the things, though.\n\nA: here is the answer.\nrysnas.com/\nYou can run a VM of windows for iTunes Home Sharing on your NAS box now.\n", "Q: How to elegantly obstruct the iSight lens? Sometimes you see people placing a sticker over the iSight camera on their MacBook's such that no one can spy on them.\nThis might seem ridiculous, but from a previous answer it is clear that it is possible to activate the iSight without activating the \"hardwired\" LED as well. It was first thought that this was only possible with older models (as shown by this paper), but this article mentions that the FBI reportedly can do this to newer models.\nBesides that, I just found that the Dutch head of the cybercrime department officially advises (link in Dutch) to cover the webcam lens.\nNow the question:\nAre there any elegant solutions to obstructing the iSight lens, besides using tape? I don't want to use tape as it often leaves a residue and looks a bit \"meh\".\n\nA: Elegant would be black glossy vinyl circular sticker that would adhere to the glass naturally.\nIf you were paranoid, black is a bad color as you will not have visual confirmation that the sticker has moved should it shift. That is why most people I know put a very visual color and use adhesive as they want to see when it moves and not have it slip.\nRemoving the camera kernel extension is far better for my use since I can't accidentally have that \"fall off\" when I'm not looking.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I deactivate my microphone and iSight for security reasons?\nWith that solution, the elegance of Apple's physical design is maintained and I only have to disable software updates or set a watcher script to alert me if that kext is reloaded / replaced.\n\nA: I recommend app called Camera Guard (https://www.protectstar.com/en/camera-guard), which prevents webcam from running.  A cool feature is that it has a pop-up dialog when the camera becomes active, so that the user knows that their Macbook has been breached or compromised.    There's free as well as pro version (not free), which also blocks the microphone as well.  I think the free version is good enough, and the software solution is a lot nicer and more elegant than putting tape on the camera lens.\n", "Q: How can OS X be installed from ISO file on a Mac?

Since upgrading to Mavericks, the Calendar app will pester me for my gmail password every half hour or so, even though it already has the correct password stored.\nI've tried changing the password, setting up 2-step verification and creating an app-specific password, changing the app-specific password... I even tried deleting all of the relevant passwords from the Keychain Access app and then entering a new app-specific password into Calendar, and still Calendar continually pesters me to re-enter the password.\nI'd blame google, but since Calendar (and specifically Mavericks Calendar) is the only app that has trouble with the Google calendar, that says that the problem is on Apple's side.  Has anyone experiencing similar problems found a workaround?\n\nA: It turns out the issue for me is that OSX has created 2 entries in the Calendar app for my Gmail account (even though I only have the account entered once under the Internet Accounts system pref).\nThe Calendar app won't let me delete the duplicate since it thinks the duplicate is managed under the Internet Accounts pref. Deleting and re-adding the gmail account in Internet Accounts didn't help either.  After deleting the Internet Account, the duplicate still sticks around in the Calendar app is not deletable since the Calendar app can't delete it, and there is no corresponding Internet Account for that calendar.\nI got around the issue by un-checking the \"Enable this account\" checkbox for the duplicate in the Calendar app (since it won't let me delete it).  That at least makes it stop checking for calendar updates so I don't get pestered for passwords.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > iCloud and untick both Calendar and Contacts.\nWait briefly before restoring the ticks again.\n", "Q: Edit contents of file from Finder with text editor As a developer I need to constantly be examining/editing the contents of text files, and opening them from Finder and the command line.\nI would like to right click the file in finder, and have the menu option \"Open with Sublime Text Editor\" or at least TextEdit!\nThere even seems to be the option to do this at least with the default TextEdit in Mavericks:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Files&Folders > Open Selected Files in TextEdit\n\nBut if I check that, nothing happens!

You can disable Gatekeeper from System Preferences:\n\nSelecting \"Always Open With\" from the \"Open With > Other...\" dialog only changes the default application for the selected files. You can change the default application for all files of a type from a Show Info window:\n\nYou can add a context menu item for opening files in TextEdit by creating a service like this with Automator:\n\nIf you have the Powerpack for Alfred 2, you can also create a workflow like this:\n\nYou can use duti to make TextEdit the default application for plain text files without an extension and executable scripts.

But I am posting an image to make my problem straight forward.\nI’m new to Mac. Had my Mac Book Pro for roughly 1 month. I ran into a specific problem that I just could not solve.\nI’ll start out with how I solved the problem in Windows. And my question is how I should have done it in OSX Mavericks.\nI had specific instructions from someone to visit a website and prepare a print screen.\nSo I went up on the website with Safari and wanted to start print screening as per my instructions. In order to make my print screen more legitimate - according to my instructions - I had to press F12 and on the lower part of the monitor I should have gotten a window where I could choose from different options. I had specific instructions what to look for in the window that popped up with the F12 key.\nI looked through many websites but couldn’t find a solution to my problem as my F12 key didn’t function as it should have in Mac. I tried altering the function keys in the keyboard settings but that didn’t work either. So in the end I took out my old Windows laptop and solved the problem with that. Mind you the correct window that I needed for my specific purpose did not pop up in Firefox or Internet Explorer. I needed to download Google Chrome.

I see the passwd function and the master.passwd function, however I don't see any documentation on either of these to set the master password (AFAIK, these set the user passwords only).\nI am pulling my information from these sources:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ph7032\nWhat does this command do: sudo dscl . passwd /Users/administrator thePassword\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/darwin/reference/manpages/man5/master.passwd.5.html\nMy question is:\nCan you use the passwd or master.passwd commands to set the master password? If so, can you please provide an example for how to accomplish this?\n\nA: First, a few things to note:\nOn the Mac the files /etc/passwd and /etc/master.passwd are only consulted when the Mac is booted into single user mode.\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"set the master password\" for the Mac. Do you mean set the password for the account 'root'?\nUsually you use the passwd command to change passwords from the command line (there is no master.passwd command) but you can't use it from a script as it requires input.\nTo change a password in a script you need to  use the dscl command.\nHere is an example : \ndscl . -passwd /Users/tonyw newpass\nNote that the above would have to be run as root, which means your script would have to be run by root. Otherwise you have to add authentication to the dscl command thus:\ndscl . -u Admin -P adminpassword -passwd /Users/tonyw newpass\nThe user Admin must have administrator privileges for the Mac.\n(All of this is incredibly insecure as you have passwords in plain text in a script.)\nOf course to set the password for 'root' just change the tonyw to root in the above.\nHave a good look at dscl(1) to understand the options in the above.\n\nA: OK, for FileVault you need to use the fdesetup command. Set up a test Mac, have a long hard look at the man page and give it all a try. From the man page it looks like you can change the FileVault recovery password using the changerecovery option.\nSorry, but I'm not prepared to do the testing to give you the exact commands as getting it wrong could seriously screw my Mac. There are a bunch of examples in the man page.\nBTW - I found it by going apropos FileVault at the command line. Always a good first step.\n\nA: Restart your Mac and hold Command+s, let it load, and then type:\n/sbin/fsck -y\n/sbin/mount -UAW\n\nThis will bring up a user directory, then type:\nls /Users/\n\nNote let's assume account name is xyz, type:\npasswd xyz\n\nNote the command line should be blank. Type in the new password and press enter. Note the command line should be blank again.\nRetype the new password and press enter. Finally type:\nreboot\n\n", "Q: The backup on Server is already in use I have OS X Mavericks with the Server software installed. The server machine is an iMac with a Drobo attached via USB. I use the Server Time Machine service to create a backup server on the network, using the Drobo as the storage device for backups.\nI am currently backing-up two Macbooks to this Time Machine Server. Some backups will succeed but every other day or so, I will get an error on both laptops that the backup failed with the following reason: The backup on Server is already in use.\nI have only been able to clear this problem by restarting the server. \nDoes anyone know why this might be occurring and what I might be able to do in order to prevent it from happening?\nThank you.\n\nA: Just for the completeness of this issue. If you land here and do not use MacOS Server, but a Synology DiskStation, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to your DiskStation as root\n\n*Open the main menu\n\n*start the resource monitor\n\n*switch to connected users\n\n*select the blocked user and press disconnect\n\nA: I have got this problem since I got my OS X Server, and still do get this error. Whenever my router disconnects, it causes this until I fix it. However, instead of restarting the server, there's a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Server.app (I do this on the client that I'm using, but you could do it on the server itself) and login.\n\n*Select the File Sharing service.\n\n*Go to the Connected Users tab.\n\n*Select each connected user and click Disconnect.\n\n\nI have to do this so often I wrote a Keyboard Maestro macro for this, but any scripting software would do this.\n\nA: If disconnecting users \"fixes\" the problem then it's almost certainly somewhere in the AppleFileServer process.\nHave a look at the AFP access and error logs and see if you can find a better error message than the one you get on the client Mac and you may well be closer to a solution. Click on Logs in the left hand pane of the Server app and then select AFP Error in the pop up below the log window.\nThe problem might also be with the RAID in the Drobo. Have you tried another hard drive just to see if the problem goes away? Which model Drobo is it? Drobo support mutters under its breath about Lion and Time Machine so may well also have problems with Mavericks and Time Machine. (I get around the problem by having a single 2TB drive with 3 partitions as my TM target and then back that up to my Drobo using Carbon Copy Cloner.)\n\nA: @grgarside is on the money - this happens when there are two connections to the backup from the same IP. \nOn my network I stopped it from happening by disabling guest access to the backup drive(s). \nOn the server machine, \n\n\n*\n\n*Login to OS X Server \n\n*click File Sharing\n\n*click on the settings tab\n\n*select the backup drive in question\n\n*uncheck the box Enable Guest Access\n\n*click the connections tab\n\n*then disconnect all users. \n\n\nLogin to the server on the client machine again and you're good to go. Once guest access was disabled, the client won't automatically connect to the server using the guest protocol, thus preventing multiple connections. \n\nA: I had a similar issue with my Synology NAS after having followed Synology's Time Machine guide.  When trying to connect to the Backup Disk, Time Machine said \"You do not have the necessary read, write and append privileges on the selected network backup disk.\" \nThe only solution that worked for me was to restart Synology DSM by clicking on the person/user icon in the top right and selecting \"Restart\"\n\nA: If you get the error message \"Time Machine could not complete the backup. The backup disk image “/Volumes/mac-backups-1/machine-name.sparsebundle” is already in use.\" and you are using a Synology DiskStation DSM 5.2 (NAS) as the destination for Time Machine backups, the following steps resolved the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to your DiskStation as admin\n\n*Select the Options icon (at the\ntop right -- looks like a person's head) \n\n*Options > Account > Account\nActivity > Connected Users \n\n*For each user on AFP Service and\nResource: mac-backups, press disconnect (red circle with white\nhorizontal bar).  The issues seems to be that there are two or more\nconnected users both connected to AFP > Resource: mac-backups. \nThere should only be one. \n\n*Click Refresh.  There should now only be\none user connected to AFP > Resource: mac-backups. \n\n*On your MacBook > Time Machine icon > Start Backup.  Time Machine backup begins (circling counterclockwise) and you no longer get the above error message.\n\n\nI am not sure exactly how this situation occurs, but here is my theory: After disconnecting the MacBook and reconnecting to another network (moving my MacBook to another location while traveling), the connection to the synology resource: mac-backups (used by Time Machine) did not get properly disconnected, so when the machine was reintroduced into the network, another new connection was established, even though the existing connection was still present, creating a conflict and the subject error message.\nTo Be Tested: To prevent this error from happening again, if Time Machine is in-progress doing a backup, try doing a \"Stop Backing Up\" command in Time Machine before moving your MacBook to another location off-network.  Hopefully, when you bring the machine back to the network where the synology NAS is located, the error should no longer occur.\n\nA: \nWhat worked for me was to reboot the DS, delete and recreate the Time Machine share.\n\nFrom this post on Synology Forum https://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=159&t=86535&start=15#p512709\n", "Q: Pages 5: Increase indentation in table of contents?

Select a heading in the TOC then open up the Format Panel, go into the Text tab and change the Indents/First value (see pic). This updates the TOC's indentation for that type of header. \n\n\nA: I wanted to know how I could define the order and layout of paragraph styles I added. Didn't find anything useful and Landed on this page. So I started to experiment and found it.\nGo to the table of contents you generated, click on it. Click on the format inspector (the paintbrush). You can individually format every line, including indents.

The files automatically end up in my Downloads folder, so it would make sense to sort the files by Date Added so the stuff I just got will be at the top of the list for easy selection.\nProblem is, this doesn't happen. In fact, I don't see any rhyme or reason to what I'm getting here:\n\nNote that I'm sorting by Date Added, descending, so the items from today should be at the top of the list. Instead they're halfway down the bottom and jumbled in with a bunch of other items. Under a \"2012\" heading. For a file that was downloaded today.\nIf I open the Downloads folder up in Finder and apply the same sort, the files appear correctly:\n\nThis strange behavior happens in every application that uses the system file picker.\nAny idea what's causing this and how to fix it?\n\nA: Finder and the file dialogs have had two different sorting modes (sort by and arrange by) since 10.7. In the first screenshot, the arrange by mode is probably set to date created or date last opened. Try changing it to none instead:\n\nThe menu shown above changes the arrange by mode and clicking one of the header columns changes the sort by mode.\n\nA: For macOS Monterey\nThe default order for sort and the default selection for arrange are not shared between Finder and Open/Save file dialogs. The settings must be specified in each case separately.\nHowever, the button in the Open/Save file dialog does double-duty for Arrange and Sort, depending on whether you hold down the ⌥ key or not, as described by the hover tooltip. Hold down the ⌥ and click the button to set the sort order for the Open/Save file dialog.\n\nHere is the button's default function.

I have all the media on SMB shares that are mounted on the iMac as a login item in OS X.  The configuration works well, and I share the server with about 20 people and support all 4 TVs in my house plus about 3-5 concurrent remote streams.

But if User B (in Group B) logs in, the HTTP and HTTPS proxy is removed. I was able to set it up as explained below, however, I can only change the proxy settings for Wi-Fi adapters, the Ethernet adapter does not have proxy settings. The global HTTP proxy option only proxies HTTP but not HTTPS protocols allowing users to view blacklisted sites on HTTPS.\nIs there any way to apply proxy settings on Ethernet, or any other way to apply HTTP and HTTPS proxy settings?\n\nA: Yes.\nYou will have to use Profile Manager and manage the settings on the Mac. Set up a default profile with the default proxy settings for the managed Mac.\nYou can then set the profile for any of the groups you create in Open Directory to override those settings.\nA Profile Manager tutorial is a little beyond an answer here but check out:\nhttp://www.apple.com/au/support/lionserver/profilemanager/\nand \nhttp://krypted.com/mac-security/configuring-using-profile-manager-2-in-os-x-mountain-lion-server/\nFor the Ethernet proxy settings you will have to use a Custom Settings payload.

I can mount it in a hard drive slot or get a PCI card and mount it there. \nThe SATA speed of the Mac is 3Gb/s, but the PCI shows 'Link Speed:5.0 GT/s' which (I could be wrong) is 5G 'transfers' per second, since the encoding is a 10 to 8 ratio it's really 4Gb/s? \nIt seems if I'm going to make the effort, it's worth it to gain a bit of speed, and not lose a HDD slot. I've googled quite a bit, and not seeing this discussed anywhere. \n\nA: I have a 2008 Mac Pro and I swapped the main HDD with an SSD and re-installed OS X and I saw a HUGE performance increase. You'll always see a performance increase when going from HDD to SSD simply because it's a different class of hardware. SSDs are, as their name implies, solid-state. There are no moving parts and there's nothing that physically degrades over time. HDDs start to wear immediately; while it's a slow process it does happen for as long as the drive is in use (that's why most operating systems tend to turn HDDs off when not in use - it prolongs their life).\nThat's my experience and my recommendation (my recommendation is definitely do it).\n", "Q: I've lost a lot of my accessory windows from some random app install To start: I'm a software dev much more comfortable on Windows than OSX.

Just make sure to keep your iTunes library synced to your new iPad. This way you will have all the same multimedia library on the iPad as on your iPhone and have a single iTunes library manage both your devices.\n", "Q: Find files modified today, using command line (bash) As we all know, despite being named \"Finder\", the Finder is virtually useless at finding files. \nIn Mac OS X 10.6 (or any version), how can I use the command line (bash in Terminal) to find files modified today?\n\nA: There are several ways to do this in bash from the terminal - depending on exactly what you want to find:\nFind files modified in the last 24 hours\nfind / -mtime -1 -print\n\nFind files modified today (likely what you want)\nfind / -newerct 'yesterday' -print\n\nor, using Spotlight\nmdfind date:today\n\nThis can also be done from the GUI with Spotlight.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Spotlight (option-command space by default).\n\n*Add a criteria to search for, by hitting the Plus sign near the top\nright of the Spotlight window.\n\n*Change the criteria to \"Last modified date\" is \"today.\"\n\n", "Q: Adding new rule for emails containing header Is it possible to create a new rule for mail to perform an action if the message contains a custom header?  \nI want to automaticaly detect emails that contain the \"X-hashcash\" header.  \n\nA: Yes.\nIf you go to Preferences Rules and Add Rule then the first of the condition pop up lists has Edit header list.. as the last choice.

Suppose I copy a 1GB file. The progress bar moves, network activity occurs (if transferring to the NAS), and so on... The error appears as soon as the file copy should finish.\nA reboot does not solve this. This is becoming almost reliably reproducible as well. I have no unusual system extensions installed and this behavior started to appear suddenly and seems to have progressively worsened. Initially when it occurred a second copy often would work, but now a second or even third copy often fails and it takes sometimes upwards of four copies to make it work.\nI can successfully copy anything at the terminal using cp, but this isn't really a solution - this is such a simple operation and there is no reason it should be causing errors like this. \nAs i said, the most interesting part is that it is occurring after the data has actually been moved. When the copy fails, it then deletes the corresponding destination file. \nIt's worth pointing out that this does not occur if copying to the same drive. For example, hitting ⌘ Cmd+D to duplicate a file and make a copy on the same disk never fails. Even moving around the same disk works as it should.\n(No, I'm not trying to move, but rather simply copy a file.)\nAnyone seen this before?\n\nA: Mavericks uses SMB2 as default, which still is a little bit buggy and might be causing this problem. You can force Mavericks to use SMB again by entering this in Terminal:\necho \"[default]\" >> ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf; echo \"smb_neg=smb1_only\" >> ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf\n\nand restore SMB2 default by:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf\n\nSource: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20131122083837447\n", "Q: How do I focus a specific window with applescript without doing an activate and bringing other windows to the front?

When it disconnects, it continues playing audio from the TV, but the video freezes on the TV. It still continues to play the video on my Mac.\n\n\nHow can I fix this? I haven't seen wireless connectivity issues, but would it help if I put an AirPort Express to extend the network in my bedroom (I have a new AirPort Time Capsule)?\n\nA: Try this: open \"Wireless Diagnostics\" via Spotlight → Search/open Wireless Diagnostics → Window → Utilities and perform a wi-fi scan. Make sure that your router use a wireless channel with no/minimal other networks (you can change the channel via airport utility). If problem persists, try using the other wireless frequency (2.4ghz vs. 5ghz) via airport utility.\nNext try streaming with Beamer app - much better video quality than airplay mirroring. Its a lovely app, and free to try. Solved all my airplay problems (have almost same setup; macbook retina + apple tv + airport extreme ac).\nIf problem persist, I guess I would try extending with an Airport Express (you can check the signal quality in wireless diagnostics).\n", "Q: If I delete 1 Apple ID (email address) will the same email addy become available to use again?

Whenever I start my computer I see a flashing folder with a question mark. I know this is supposed to be a common problem wich can be usually solved by the solution provided by Apple support.\nHowever, my issue is different. Here is how it all started: I wanted to install Windows using bootcamp. The installer complained that my hard disk was corrupted and that I need to repair it using the recorvery HD. When I tried, I was asked to provide the firmware password. Since I did not have it ( I wrote it it on a piece of paper that I did not have access to at the moment), I went back and restarted my in target mode so I can back up my documents on another mac. Unfortunatelly, after restarting in target mode, I was asked to provide the firmare password again. When I finally got the password, my computer restarted with a flashing folder with a question mark. \nI have tried all troubleshooting available on the internet and nothing seems to work. Some people think that I need to replace my internal HD cable. However, how can this be? I didn't mess up with my hard disk at all. During the troubleshooting, I used a bootable hard-drive, and notice that I could no longer see my HD in the list of available hard-drives. It is like it is completely gone. Can someone please suggest any solution? Please keep in mind that I live thousands of miles away from any Apple store. I can't get any official support. I have to fix this myself.\n\nA: It would seem that the drive is no longer \"blessed\".\nFirst, try booting the Mac while holding down the option key and if the drive is in the list of boot devices then selecting it once will \"bless\" the drive and you should be able to boot off it once again.\nIf that doesn't work then boot off the bootable hard drive you mentioned and run Disk Utility which can be found in /Applications/Utilities and you should be able to see the drive in the drive list. Once there you can try to first verify then repair the disk.\n\nA: Booting into recovery mode is my first inclination.\nIf/when that doesn't work, use another mac with the same 10.X and a SATA adapter to reinstall OSX on to the partition that you use for OSX. \n\nI think your problem stemmed from corruptions on your disk, then you\n  partitioned it without fixing them. Booting into the bootcamp setup\n  mode is... a delicate process is the best way to put it. Provided you\n  do it perfectly there isn't any problems, but deviate or have any\n  issues going into it and it can mess up your EFI_BOOT settings.\n\nReinstalling OSX on the partition should just fix the OSX files on the drive, not touching any of yours. \nAlso run Disk Utility to fix/verify everything. \n\nA: This has happened to me (iMac Early 2008) and it was a hard drive failure. You should try what Tony said, and if that doesn't work, you should go to the Genius Bar. When this happened to me, the drive was 6 months old and wouldn't spin up (meaning it failed one of its self-tests and shut down). Hopefully, if this is a hard drive failure, they can recover your data. You should also try Apple Hardware Test.

Is there a way to force them to always run in english?\nMy terminal has this option selected:\nTerminal > Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Advanced > Set locale environment variables on startup\n\n\nA: It depends upon the program. If it uses gettext which is a common library for doing internationalization then setting the LANG environment variable to en_US (or en_UK if you want British Enligh vs. American English) should do the trick.\nIf you only want specific applications to use english messages then you can alias the command to something like LANG=en_US command-you-want-in-english. \nAliasing is dependant upon which shell you are using but in bash (the default shell on MacOSX) you would put the following command in your .bashrc or .bash_profile: \nalias command='LANG=en_US command'\n\nWhen in doubt - look to the man page or manual for the command you are running to see if they give details on how their internationalization is implemented and how you as a user can control it.\n\nA: Since you haven't unchecked \"Set locale environment variables on startup\", Terminal sets LANG based on the region selected in System Preferences.\n$ defaults read -g AppleLocale\nja_JP\n$ locale\nLANG=\"ja_JP.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"ja_JP.UTF-8\"\nLC_CTYPE=\"ja_JP.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"ja_JP.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"ja_JP.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"ja_JP.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"ja_JP.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n$ asd\nbash: asd: コマンドが見つかりません\n\nYou can change LANG by adding a line like this to ~/.bash_profile:\nexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\nAfter that the commands above should print something like this:\n$ locale\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n$ asd\nbash: asd: command not found\n\nLC_ALL does not have to be set. LANG and LC_ALL are different ways to change the the actual LC_ variables that are shown between LANG and LC_ALL above. LANG is used as a default value for unset locale variables. LC_ALL overrides locale variables even if they have been set, and if it is set, changing other locale variables has no effect.\nIf you uncheck \"Set locale environment variables on startup\" and don't configure the locale variables anywhere, shells will use the C locale by default. It makes working with non-ASCII text difficult though. In bash non-ASCII characters are displayed and inserted as escape-sequences and for example ä is interpreted as M-l. You can fix all those by changing output-meta, input-meta, and convert-meta in ~/.inputrc, but even then pbpaste and pbcopy jumble up UTF-8 characters, ls shows non-ASCII characters as question marks, and you can't type non-ASCII characters in Emacs. It's easier to use a UTF-8 locale in my opinion.\n", "Q: Fastest and safest way to copy massive data from one external drive to another I need to be able to copy about 2TB of data from an external drive (single USB external disk) to a another external drive (Drobo attached via Firewire).\nFinder is not an option.

My answer is copied below.\n\nI use cp -Rfv sourcefile destinationfile with success on a pretty regular basis.\ncp = copy\nR = maintains file hierarchies\nf = if  an  existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again\nv = verbose mode, displays files transferred as it progresses\nsourcefile = data you want to copy\ndestinationfile = directory/drive you want to copy to\n\nA: I used bittorrent sync to sync 8TB between my Drobo and QNAP.\n\nA: If you don't want to go the command line route, I use the FreeFileSync app  routinely to sync 2 TB of data from an external array to a network location without issue.  You can control how it handles errors and get a log when its complete.  \n\nA: The \"fastest\" way would be to physically move both drives to be internal to a single computer, do the copy (or rsync), and then move them back.  \nI'd still use rsync, because if interrupted for any reason (cat steps on the power switch?), rsync will not recopy the files that were already successful.  It also won't copy any files that are the same and in the same place.\n\nA: If you would like to copy drive A to drive B exactly you can do this with Disk Utility.\n\nWe will be using Disk Utility's restore function. Some background on the different between Restoring vs copy and pasting:\n\nThe Restore function in Disk Utility makes use of a block copy\nfunction that can speed up the copy process. It also makes an almost\nexact copy of the source device. When we say \"almost exact,\" we don't\nmean to imply that useful data may get left behind, because that's not\nthe case. What it means is that a block copy copies everything in a\ndata block from one device to the other. The results are almost an\nexact copy of the original. A file copy, on the other hand, copies\ndata file by file, and while the file data remains the same, the\nlocation of the file on the source and destination devices will likely\nbe very different.\nUsing a block copy is faster, but it does have some limits that affect\nwhen it can be used, the most important being that copying block by\nblock requires that both the source and destination devices be first\nunmounted from your Mac. This ensures that block data doesn't change\nduring the copy process. Don’t worry, though; you don’t have to do the\nunmounting. Disk Utility’s Restore function takes care of that for\nyou. But it does mean that neither the source nor the destination can\nbe in use when you use the Restore capabilities.\n\nSource: https://www.lifewire.com/use-disk-utility-to-clone-macs-drive-4042367\n\nInstructions\nfor copying all files from Device A to Device B\n\nWARNING: When you restore one volume to another, all the files on the destination volume are erased.

You can prepare the command and perform a dry-run before committing to the copy; add --dry-run to simulate the copy.\nYour final command will be fairly simple:\nsudo rsync -vaE --progress /Volumes/SourceName /Volumes/DestinationName\n\nThe flags are:\n\n\n*\n\n*v increases verbosity.\n\n*a applies archive settings to mirror the source files exactly, including symbolic links and permissions.\n\n*E copies extended attributes and resource forks (OS X only).\n\n*--progress shows progress during the copy.\n\n\nsudo, is used to ensure rsync has appropriate rights to access and read all files on your drive regardless of owner. This also allows rsync to write the files to the new drive recreating the original owner information.\nrsync is likely the best choice because it can be rerun in case of problems, offers detailed logging, and is as fast as can be while remaining safe.\nThere are numerous guides for getting the most from rsync, rsync command examples provides relevant examples. Take care with the trailing slashes; these can make a world of difference if your copy starts with a folder.\nAlternative tools include ditto and cp. Both are reasonable choices but offer differing syntax.\n", "Q: iPhone almost always defaults to Music app over Spotify Before iOS 7 it seemed like if I had a \"music\" app open, when I would hit the play button (from the lock screen, ear bud button, bluetooth speakers, etc.) the music from that app would start playing. Now however, it only does that sometimes. For example, last night, I was listening to Spotify on my phone. When I was on my way to work this morning, I hit the bluetooth play button in my car, and it started playing Spotify (exactly what I wanted). Then after I have been to work for about an hour, I plug my ear buds in and hit play, the Apple Music app takes over.\nBefore I hit the play button, the Spotify app was open and the Music app was closed.\nAny idea why this is happening? My phone also randomly restarts from time to time and I am worried that there is something bigger going on with my phone than the Music app just wanting to take over all the time. I would love to know if other people are having this problem or if it's something rare.\nMy device is an iPhone 5s with the latest version of iOS 7.\n\nA: It's nothing to do with your iphone it's generally an option on your stereo settings. On my ford fusion, I can select between two apps - Podcasts and Music. I guess it depends on whether your stereo was precisely developed for iPhone or it is generic for any other bluetooth connection.\n", "Q: Attempting to boot into Mac partition after Boot Camp results in a password lock I have just installed Windows on my Mac and it worked well, but after finishing and trying to go to Mac partition it is shown on the screen a lock icon with a password field. I tried to enter different password, but it didn't work.\n\nA: From your description, I believe you're looking at the firmware password:\n\nThis isn't specific for Boot Camp, and would have been set through the Firmware Password Utility. If you can't remember the password you set and can't boot into Mac, you'll need to go to an Apple Store. \n", "Q: Looking for an alternative browser that doesn't leak memory nor my data, and is secure lately I have been using Firefox. It works rather well, but given my browsing habits (I never close down Firefox, I rarely reboot my macbook) I end up with an instance of Firefox that eats up 2/3 GB of RAM.\nThis is obviously unacceptable, and Firefox is well known to have memory leaks here and there. On the long run, \"here and there\" bogs down my machine and I need to close it down (when it doesn't crash) and restart it, and since I don't save things in the browsers (password, forms ecc) I need to re-login everywhere. :(\nOn the other hand I am concerned with Chrome and Safari, since I don't want history on my browser, nor want to provide data about a person (me) to third parties (via cookies, history, habits, tracking, whatever). So no Safari, no Chrome.\nI don't know about Opera, but I never used it: I have always been curious, and I will download it today.\nSo here's the question: given all of the previous information, which is the browser safe, not-leaking-memory and that respects my privacy that you would advise me to use?\nThanks!\n\nA: Chrome is a data mining operation, pure and simple. It's based on Chromium, however, which is less intrusive and can use all the Chrome add-ons -- though many of those are deceptive and are actually trackers, adware and malware. This is why I stick to Firefox.\n\nA: Use Safari or Chrome in Private Browsing or Incognito mode, and set Do Not Track.\n\n\nA: A lot has changed since you posted, notably Firefox runs separate processes like Chrome. I still personally use Firefox for similar reasons listed above and that it one of the few browsers that doesn't just use some form of webkit. The one thing that has really helped with memory is using an auto-unloading plugin which removes resources used by open tabs, but keeps the tabs there. Makes it easy to come back to old tabs, makes sure scripts aren't running in the background and makes it very quick to close tabs en masse.\nOne downside of Firefox is that because of it's shrinking market-share more and more sites are not working correctly with it (AETNA for instance).\n", "Q: After upgrade of retail iWork 09 DVD it appeard on my Apple Store account I found my iWork 09 retail DVD, which I bought 4.5 years ago. After I installed it, Apple Store showed me that I've got an upgrade to version 13. Next, it appeared on my Apple Store account in purchases, after upgrade. Is it normal behaviour or it is a bug?\n\nA: It's a normal behaviour so you can directly download the new Pages, Keynote & Numbers on your new Macs (or new OSX installations). \n", "Q: Exchange Calendar import Being a freelance designer I have a shared iCloud calendar with my wife so she knows what to expect from my work week. I also have an exchange account cause of my Microsoft work but my wife can't see this. Is there any way to import my exchange calendar info to my iCloud calendar so my wife can be kept up to date?\n\nA: If this solution existed I would have been very pleased. Unfortunately I've been searching for this option a lot and the answer is no.\nI'm currently using a work-around in which I've logged in with my Exchange account on the iPad at home and only checked the option to display the calendar of that particular Exchange account. (This also works for an iPhone or iPod Touch)\nThe calendar is now visible to everyone with access to the iDevice, and you can open and combine them in view. So you can see everything together even when it comes from multiple accounts.\nI hope this is a possible solution which can work for you, as there is no easy way to copy or sync your calendar (yet).\n\nA: Have you tried iCloud Control Panel for Windows?\n\niCloud keeps mail, contacts, and calendars up to date between your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, and Windows PC, and lets you share calendars and task lists.\n\n", "Q: Can I create a keyboard shortcut to lock a file in Finder? I'm constantly opening Info panes so that I can lock the currently selected files in Finder. Keeping the Info pane open is no longer good enough; it gets cumbersome to manage with multiple desktops and screens.\nCan I assign a keyboard shortcut to do this?\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro can do this with a macro such as this, which will run chflags uchg on every file in the current Finder selection:\n\n\nA: You can actually accomplish this without any extra software by using Automator and System Preferences (at least as of macOS Catalina).\nAutomator\nOpen Automator and choose \"Quick Action\" as your document type (button looks like a gear).

This enables Automator to capture the selection and pass into the shell script code as a variable.\nIt will populate some sample code for you, which you can delete. For the Locking script, use this code:\nchflags uchg \"$@\"\nFor unlocking:\nchflags nouchg \"$@\"\nSave the workflows with names like \"Lock File\" and \"Unlock File\" and then close.\nYou can right click files in Finder at this point to check that the quick actions are now available.\nSystem Preferences \nNavigate to System Preferences, then Keyboard.

The partial backup is kept in an .inProgress file.\n", "Q: Can Super Duper perform \"smart update\" from SSD to HDD? My goal is to create a bootable backup of my SSD boot drive on an external HDD. I'm using a Mac Pro mid-2010, so I can swap out the boot drive should my SSD ever get corrupted. Is there any reason Super Duper wouldn't be able to \"smart update\" a clone of the SSD onto an HDD? (And should I consider alternatives to Super Duper?)\n\nA: SuperDuper can do this. I've done it with a MacBook before. As far as SuperDuper is concerned, it's just two drives. \n\nA: From the developer: \n\nOf course.

Today, several paid apps we have our eyes on to purchase for use on our classroom iPads through the VPP program are available free for the day, so I downloaded them and installed them in Apple Configurator, where they indeed show up as being free in the list of apps and can be installed on iDevices without problems.\nI'm concerned that somehow this is not legal to do, but I cannot find any verbiage indicating this illegality. I'm assuming that if the app is free at the time of download, it remains free to install on devices despite the app's previous, and future, availability as a paid app.\nDoes anybody have any definitive information?\n\nA: Most software has an EULA | End User License Agreement associated with it — which is essentially a contract between the licensor and purchaser, that defines how the established purchaser can use the software along with the liability of the licensor.\nEULA's are deployed in many different ways; often you might never see or know where to look for one within an application and/or on the developers website. Each application has it's own agreement(s), rules, and fine print. For every app you have it's likely to have an agreement that is completely different from another.\nI had very tough time finding the EULA for Comic Life, since the website contained nothing that I could find. I eventually found it in the application under Window > Software License Agreement. I downloaded the trial version, so the eula associated with my version likely differs from yours. I'll spare you the entire agreement, since it's roughly 2383 words long.\nHere's Section (B):\n\nB. Comic Life Single User License. This License allows you to install\nand use the plasq Software (whether trial or full version) on all your\npersonal computers. These are computers that are exclusively used by\nyou alone.\n\nSo for this version you would need to be the only person in your classroom using the application or the computers, which seems a bit comical really :D\n", "Q: How do I close cfprefsd so that I can update Flash on mavericks I have downloaded the Flash 12 updater and tried to run the update. The updater complains that I need to close cfprefsd. \nWhen I force quit cfprefsd though the Activity Monitor, it restarts it's self.

OmniDiskSweep isn't picking up what is using my space. I recently deleted a 60GB drive (not partition) that VMWare Fusion was using, and emptied the trash. Now it doesn't show up on any disk sweeper, but is still accounting as used space. I have restarted my computer.\n\n\nA: It's probably still stored in a Time Machine local backup. Open Finder, browse to the original location of the drive you deleted, then open Time Machine. Go back in time to find the file, then right-click it and delete the backup of it. This will return the space.\n\nA: If you have enabled Time Machine, the disk space may be taken up by local snapshots. Local snapshots are enabled by default for laptops and disabled for desktop Macs. When they are enabled, Time Machine saves hourly snapshots to /Volumes/MobileBackups/ when a backup disk is not available and there is more than 10% free disk space. The local snapshots are not counted as used disk space in Finder, but they are classified as backups in the About This Mac window. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4878 for more information.\nIf it's not that, you might have the same issue I had with my MacBook Air. It was missing about 20 GB of disk space that was classified as other in the About This Mac window and shown as hidden space by Daisy Disk. When I tried verifying the Macintosh HD volume in Disk Utility, there was an error about an invalid free block count. I was then able to free up the disk space by repairing the disk from the recovery partition.\nTo see if the space is actually taken up by some files, you can use du:\n$ sudo du -h -d1 /\n155M    /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n112K    /.fseventsd\n  0B    /.PKInstallSandboxManager\n1.2G    /.Spotlight-V100\n  0B    /.Trashes\n  0B    /.vol\n 36G    /Applications\n2.6M    /bin\n  0B    /cores\n4.5K    /dev\n1.0K    /home\n9.2G    /Library\n1.0K    /net\n  0B    /Network\n350M    /opt\n 12G    /private\n980K    /sbin\n6.8G    /System\n802G    /Users\n7.5G    /usr\n 12K    /Volumes\n875G    /\n\n-d1 sets the depth to 1 and -h uses human-readable file sizes.\n\nA: In my case it was iCloud synced photos from Photostream. Even though I had since turned Photostream off in iCloud preferences and my iPhoto library was being stored on an external hard drive there was over 80GB of space being taken up in my internal hard drive by old synced photos. This was on my mid-2007 Mac Mini running OS X 10.7 Lion, by the way. More info can be found here:\nWhat is iLifeAssetManagement, and can I delete it?\nNote: the Library folder where this data is stored is hidden by default, so you have to click on finder then select \"Go\" menu and type \"~/Library\" in the \"Go to folder\" dialog to get the hidden Library folder to show up. always back up your computer before deleting any files from the Library in case you delete the wrong thing(s) and/or cause corruption.\n\nA: GrandPerspective is very usefull to check your disk usage, your gonna be able to see what is taking space and where it is . it is a opensource project available on sourceforge.\n\n", "Q: Time Machine initial backup way too large I have a Time Capsule 802.11n 1 TB at work with some free space on it, and I decided to make a second backup on it, using Time Machine. I have about 358 GB used on the hard drive, and 25 GB of that are in a folder that I excluded from the Time Machine Backup, so the actual amount of data to be backed up is about 333 GB. Yet my initial backup (before any incrementals) took up 477 GB of space on the Time Capsule. Even after running hdiutil compact on the sparse bundle, I was only able to reduce its size to 455 GB. Isn't that still excessive? I understand there may be some overhead, but really, isn't ~40% overhead excessive?\nA piece of information that may be relevant to the question: Unfortunately my rMBP has no Ethernet and I haven't purchased the USB-to-Ethernet adapter either, so the backup proceeded very slowly under 802.11n. Unable to finish the backup in a single day, I took the rMBP home each night, and on the following day, I would let Time Machine resume the backup (it did seem to be resuming since the amount to be backed up decreased every day). Eventually, a week after starting the backup, I finished it for the first time, but with a size of 477 GB as mentioned above.\nEdit: here's the output of sudo tmutil listbackups | tr '\\n' '\\0' | xargs -0 sudo tmutil uniquesize, showing backup dates and their uniquesizes:\n16.6G    /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBook Pro/2014-01-15-182027\n3.4G     /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBook Pro/2014-01-22-161530\n623.1M   /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBook Pro/2014-01-23-160536\n1.0G     /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBook Pro/2014-01-23-171738\n1.1G     /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBook Pro/2014-01-23-182535\n4.7G     /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/MacBook Pro/2014-01-24-144806\n\nThis is, of course, a few days after the question was asked, so there are new backups.

This makes it a non-starter for me.\n\nA: On mobile Mac's, Apple has enabled a function called Local Snapshots in their modern versions of OS X (Lion and later).\nThey basically function as incremental backups along the way of things that have changed. I have a feeling that these have been building up on your machine and thus the first backup will not only be the backup of the data but also these snapshots.\nIf you go into the Time Machine mode and look through the backups, if there are entries which are not purple (they are grey or white) then those are Local Snapshots included.\nYou can disable them by executing the following in a Terminal Window\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\nIt will prompt you to enter your admin password.\nFull details about this can be found on Pondini's Time Machine article #30\n\nA: I had the same problem recently.  One tool that helped immensely in discovering why my backups were so large was Backup Loupe.  Highly recommended.\n\nA: Just to give this question some closure, I got a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter, deleted the old backup -- and excuse my digression, but this something I won't recommend to anyone because it is SO SLOW; please, just erase the full drive from Airport Utility if at all possible, which wasn't my case -- and made a new one, connected via Ethernet, without any interruption. As a result, I got a .sparsebundle of the right size and ended up saving over 100 GB on my Time Capsule. But thanks anyway to everyone for their answers.\n", "Q: excluding Windows 7.pvm from Time Machine If I exclude the file: MacHD>User>FH>Documents>Parallels>Windows 7.pvm from the backup made by Time Machine, do MS Word and Excel files get backed up? \nI have configured Parallels 8 to Share Mac User folder w/Windows and to Map Mac Volumes to Windows. All my MS Office files are stored in Mac HD->Users->FH->Documents.\nI'm a bit confused. Any thought would be terrific.\nThx,\nFH\n\nA: Yes they should get backed up, since your MS Word and Excel files are located in your Mac User Documents folder and not the Parallels .pvm. If they were located within your Parallels .pvm and it's excluded, then they would not be backed up.\nThe .pvm file essentially acts as the hard disk drive for Parallels, and is basically a separate container that exists somewhat isolated from your Mac's environment. It can share files and folders with your Mac, although anything outside of it's .pvm belongs to OS X.\n", "Q: Downloading videos with Safari 7.0.1 on OS X mavericks In previous versions of Mac OS X, one could download videos in Safari with ⌥⌘A. How can this be done in Safari 7.0.1 on a OS X mavericks?\n\nA: Option-command-A is just a shortcut for showing the resources tab of the web inspector. It still works, but you have to enable the develop menu first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check Preferences > Advanced > Show Develop menu in menu bar.\n\n*Open the resources tab of the web inspector.\n\n*Look for a resource for the video under the other folder.

It is grayed out.\n\nSo...\nI boot off of G-Parted Partition Editor, and sure enough, I couldn't resize the partition! I could only make it a bit smaller to the few megabytes of remaining space.\nWhat is wrong, and is there a way to fix this? \n\nA: It's greyed out because the free space is before the partition.\nTry resizing using iPartition. iPartition can move partitions without data loss, which can usually get you out of sticky situations such as this.\nYou can modify the boot disk by making a bootable CD/DVD or installing on an external OS X installation.\n\nA: As already mentioned, the free space is before the start of your partition. You can't grow a partition from the start - you can only expand it from its end.\nYou can try something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a partition in the free space\n\n*Use something like Carbon Copy Cloner to copy the contents of your current partition into the new one\n\n*Boot from the new partition\n\n*Make sure everything works fine from the new partition - try all your usual programs, and make sure it's exactly the same as it always was\n\n*Delete the old partition\n\n*Expand the new partition to fill the hard disk space completely (reusing the space that was used by the old partition)\n\n\nThere are a few other options as well as Carbon Copy Cloner, but it has worked well for me in the past, and will make the target partition bootable.\n", "Q: Setting Account Picture/JPEGPhoto with dscl in terminal I'm working on a script based on this question: What steps are needed to create a new user from the command line on Mountain Lion?\nThe script is packaged up in an empty installer as a postflight script. \nIt's all working well enough - however, I cannot get the Account picture set. I can use dscl to set the Picture property to an image file, for example the \ndefault Apple Account photos. \nI can even copy a photo I include in the package over to a number of directories, including /Users/newAccount/Public. But the permissions are messed up and no one but the newAccount can view the profile image. I am unable to chmod the file. Instead, I have to use the GUI and \"get info -> Set Permissions\"\nThe other option that I can see is if I set the JPEGPhoto value. This is what happens when you use a custom photo or take one in photobooth. However, I'm not sure how to convert the photo I include in the installer into Hex or Whatever is being stored in the JPEGPhoto value.\nThanks!\n - Chris\nEdit: Added script. Everything works in this script - the picture just won't display, due to permissions. The path is set properly. I've tried to place it several different locations that have shared access, but no matter what the permissions are wrong and I cannot chmod them. \n###CREATE TP ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT###\n\nLastID=`dscl . -list /Users UniqueID | awk '{print $2}' | sort -n | tail -1`\n\nNextID=$((LastID + 1))\n. /etc/rc.common\ndscl . create /Users/administrator\n\ndscl . create /Users/administrator RealName \"Administrator Account\"\ndscl . create /Users/administrator hint \"the password Duh\"\n\ndscl . passwd /Users/administrator password\ndscl . create /Users/administrator UniqueID $NextID\ndscl . create /Users/administrator PrimaryGroupID 80\ndscl . create /Users/administrator UserShell /bin/bash\ndscl . create /Users/administrator NFSHomeDirectory /Users/administrator\ncp -R /System/Library/User\\ Template/English.lproj /Users/administrator\nchown -R administrator:staff /Users/administrator\n\ncp $1\"/Contents/Resources/admin.jpg\" /Users/administrator/Public\ndscl . create /Users/administrator Picture \"/Users/administrator/Public/admin.jpg\"\n\n###CREATE TP ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT###\n\n\nA: dscl\nIt seems that the most promising method is to modify the JPEGPhoto attribute for the user. The problem is, while the JPEG image can be converted very simply to a hex string, the value is too long to just pass at the command-line. This attribute seems to be what the GUI writes to when you drag in an image. Recovering the image from this variable when set is as simple as:\ndscl . read /Users/username JPEGPhoto | xxd -r -p > ./username.jpg\n\nThe second common way mentioned on the forums is to:\ndscl . delete /Users/username JPEGPhoto\ndscl . delete /Users/username Picture\ndscl . delete /Users/username Picture \"/Library/User Pictures/username.jpg\"\n\nThis only changes the 'login' icon and not the icon seen in the User detail page in System Preferences.\nUsing dsimport\nWhat does work for changing the user image is dsimport.\nThe script usage is:\n./change_userpic.sh USERNAME /path/to/image/jpg\n\nGIST\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\ndeclare -x USERNAME=\"$1\"\ndeclare -x USERPIC=\"$2\"\n\ndeclare -r DSIMPORT_CMD=\"/usr/bin/dsimport\"\ndeclare -r ID_CMD=\"/usr/bin/id\"\n\ndeclare -r MAPPINGS='0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C'\ndeclare -r ATTRS='dsRecTypeStandard:Users 2 dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName externalbinary:dsAttrTypeStandard:JPEGPhoto'\n\nif [ ! -f \"${USERPIC}\" ]; then\n  echo \"User image required\"\nfi\n\n# Check that the username exists - exit on error\n${ID_CMD} \"${USERNAME}\" &>/dev/null || ( echo \"User does not exist\" && exit 1 )\n\ndeclare -r PICIMPORT=\"$(mktemp /tmp/${USERNAME}_dsimport.XXXXXX)\" || exit 1\nprintf \"%s %s \\n%s:%s\" \"${MAPPINGS}\" \"${ATTRS}\" \"${USERNAME}\" \"${USERPIC}\" >\"${PICIMPORT}\"\n${DSIMPORT_CMD} \"${PICIMPORT}\" /Local/Default M &&\n    echo \"Successfully imported ${USERPIC} for ${USERNAME}.\"\n\nrm \"${PICIMPORT}\"\n\n\nA: Having pained over this for a couple of days, I thought I'd share what have found out about this...\nUser data is stored in the \"Open Directory\", like Apple's version of OpenLDAP or ActiveDirectory. Old documentation here. There are two user data items containing images:\n\n*\n\n*The original picture data (goes back to early OSX versions) is called Picture and contains a path to an image on the file system. It does not have to be JPEG but the path is limited to 255 UTF-8 characters.\n\n*The JPEGPhoto, is a JPEG-formatted image that is embedded into the user record (in contrast to Picture which points to a file on the file system). It seems to have been introduced around OSX 10.5/6.\n\n*If a user has both JPEGPhoto and Picture then the Picture is ignored (at least by the login and user preferences screens).\n\n*The JPEGPhoto is stored as base64-encoded JPEG image data.\n\nYou can use dscl (directory service command line) to query the directory and extract image data. If you do this then the image data is presented as hexadecimal data (i.e. the base64 is decoded into hex):\ndscl . read /Users/alice JPEGPhoto\n\nYou can decode the hex data into an image file:\ndscl . read /Users/alice JPEGPhoto | tail -1 | xxd -r -p > photo.jpg\n\n(a quick way to view an image from the macos command line is qlmanage -p photo.jpg)\nDeleting images is also done using dscl:\ndscl . delete /Users/alice JPEGPhoto\ndscl . delete /Users/alice Picture\n\nYou can also use dscl to load data:\ndscl . read /Users/alice Picture /path/to/alice.jpg\n\nThat's handy for the Picture but JPEGPhoto data is unlikely to fit on the command line as an argument. Instead, you can use dsimport to import JPEGPhoto. This requires that you create an import file as described here which distils to the following pattern seen in other answers, articles and blog posts elsewhere:\n0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 2 dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName externalbinary:dsAttrTypeStandard:JPEGPhoto\nalice:/path/to/alice.jpg\n\nThis imports the image at the given path into the JPEGPhoto of the user's record, storing it internally as base64-encoded binary data. An alternative way to do this is to pass the encoded image data directly:\n0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 2 dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName base64:dsAttrTypeStandard:JPEGPhoto\nalice:<base64 data>\n\nTo summarise the import file format, the four hex characters at the beginning specify the data format:\n\n*\n\n*0x0A       End of record is indicated by a new line\n\n*0x5C       The escape character is defined as \\\n\n*0x3A       The field separator is a :\n\n*0x2C       The value separator is a , (comma)\n\nThese values, which are the only ones ever seen in examples, define the data format such that each record is a line on its own, terminated by a newline. The record is composed of fields separated by colons and multi-value fields separate values using commas. Should there be a need to escape either of those characters then the escape character is \\.\nFollowing those four hex values is the record type (here we have dsRecTypeStandard:Users for user records), the number of fields (2) and what they are (dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName - which is the username - and dsAttrTypeStandard:JPEGPhoto). The externalbinary prefix tells dsimport how to interpret the field, in this case as the path to an image file (there are a number of these including base64, utf8 and externalutf8 but documentation about this appears lacking).\nRecall that the JPEGPhoto is stored as base64-encoded data - dsimport performs any required conversion (in the case of base64, as used above, there is no conversion).\nYou import the prepared import file like this:\ndsimport dsimport_file /Local/Default M\n\nAgain, a little explanation: /Local/Default is the path of the Open Directory and M requests that import data is merged where data exists. See the man page for dsimport. You can add --loglevel n where n is between 0 and 3 (Command Line documentation, page 118) and view log files written to ~/Library/Logs/ImportExport.\nIf replacing an image, it's necessary to delete any existing image first (use dscl, described above) otherwise the image doesn't update.\nSo, to summarise, two examples. First passing the image file's path in the import file:\n#!/bin/sh\nuser=\"$1\"\nimage=\"$2\"\ndscl . delete /Users/$user JPEGPhoto\ndscl . delete /Users/$user Picture\ntmp=\"$(mktemp)\"\nprintf \"0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 2 dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName externalbinary:dsAttrTypeStandard:JPEGPhoto\\n%s:%s\" \"$user\" \"$image\" > \"$tmp\"\ndsimport \"$tmp\" /Local/Default M\nrm \"$tmp\"\n\nAnd, secondly, encoding the image in the import file:\n#!/bin/sh\nuser=\"$1\"\nimage=\"$2\"\ndscl . delete /Users/$user JPEGPhoto\ndscl . delete /Users/$user Picture\ntmp=\"$(mktemp)\"\nprintf \"0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 2 dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName base64:dsAttrTypeStandard:JPEGPhoto\\n%s:%s\" \"$user\" \"$(base64 \"$image\")\" > \"$tmp\"\ndsimport \"$tmp\" /Local/Default M\nrm \"$tmp\"\n\nUse like this:\n$ sudo add-photo username /path/to/photo.jpg\n\n\nFootnote\nI am using this in an Ansible role to update users' avatars on multiple Apple Macs. Ansible is run on a Linux box which is why the embedded image method was interesting to me because I didn't need to write the image to each Mac's disk. In case anyone finds it useful:\n- name: User avatars\n  become: true\n  ansible.builtin.shell:\n    cmd: |\n      tmp=\"$(mktemp)\"\n      printf \"0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 2 dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName base64:dsAttrTypeStandard:JPEGPhoto\\n%s:\" \"{{item.name}}\" > \"$tmp\"\n      cat >> \"$tmp\"\n      dscl . delete /Users/{{ item.name }} JPEGPhoto\n      dsimport \"$tmp\" /Local/Default M\n      rc=$?\n      rm \"$tmp\"\n      exit $rc\n    stdin: \"{{lookup('file', item.avatar) | b64encode }}\"\n  loop:\n    \"{{ users | selectattr('avatar', 'defined') }}\"\n\nThe users passed in is a list having a name and avatar value for each.\n", "Q: Formatting from Word docs in TextEdit When I open Word docs in TextEdit some formatting is lost, especially numbered lists, the numbers are simply not displayed.

Tried to google, but couldn't find anything.\n\nA: No, there isn't a hidden preference. It's a function of the not quite standard way MS defines a standard - it's almost impossible outside MS to get all the small details of formatting right. They also have the tendency to change the file format slightly on every version.\nHave you tried opening them in Pages? It usually does a better job than TextEdit.

That is too bad. (BTW, I have 1.10.7, not a Beta version. What are they talking about?)\nWhat are some simple alternatives to Google Notifier?\nI’ve looked at Gmail Notifr and at GmailStatus but they are not really the same as Google Notifier. Are there any Google Notifier clones around?\nI’m looking for a menu-bar app, not a browser add-on.\nEDIT (Mar 10): Google Notifier seems to have stopped working today. That's sad.\n\nA: Just installed Mail Notifr - $2.99 on AppStore, or free if you download the previous version here: http://ashchan.com/projects/gmail-notifr\nAt least the paid version looks nice, clean, and in terms of functionality it's pretty similar to Google's Notifier, less Calendar notifications. Mail check frequency can be set in Preferences (Google's was a hidden undocumented feature); multiple GMail accounts are supported. I just hope it's stable and reliable enough. We'll see.\nUpdate: so far so good. One little nice thing about this app is that when the system wakes up from sleep it checks for email immediately, whereas with Google Notifier you had to wait another 5 minutes or force mail check manually.\nUpdate 2: one other thing missing compared to Google Notifier is handling of mailto: links and in general, redirecting to GMail when trying to send mail from any desktop app. Mail Notifr doesn't do this.

Although it doesn't have notifications pop up when you receive new emails, it will tell you how many unread messages are in your inbox.\n\nA: Gmail Notifier can be replaced with Checker Plus for Gmail which has desktop notifications and much more.\n\nA: You also can try MiaForGmail, a desktop email client for your Mac without a browser.\nIt's simple and it's free.\n", "Q: Are there any apps which will \"watch\" constantly and trigger actions when I type a certain string?

I didn't have to open anything like spotlight, alfred, quicksilver, etc.\nI could just type the word, no matter what app, and the script would run what it was told to.\nI imagine that creating an OS which allowed this exploit would be frowned upon by the apple engineers, but all that aside, has anyone made an app that runs like this and constantly watches all key input?\nWould learning applescript take care of something like this?\nThanks\nP.S. I have also been trying to map spotlight to the esc key. But something has already claimed the esc key. Any ideas what that would be?\n\nA: There are many ways to accomplish this depending on your needs really. You can even use a combination of things to best fit what ultimately makes you more efficient.\nI would recommend the following based upon it's type:\nAppleScript\n\nFastScripts — set hotkeys for any AppleScript by keyboard shortcut or via menubar.\n\nSystem-Wide Text Macros\n\nTextExpander - expands custom keyboard shortcuts into text, pictures, commands, etc.\n\nSystem Events\n\nLaunchBar — hotkeys file manager, search tool, app launcher, clipboard\n  manager, etc.\n\n\nA: You might also want to have a look at Alfred and Keyboard Maestro which are powerful automation tools.\nKeyboard Maestro in particular is incredibly powerful.\n", "Q: OS X Maverick 10.9 Import SSL Cert from Windows Server 2008 I created Open Directory and ProfileManager with self-signed certificate.

I'm not sure why it'd be hanging, but I can think of a few things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's not a self-signed certificate, you probably need to import the appropriate intermediate certificate(s) by dragging them into the \"Drag extra non-identity certificates here\" section of the import dialog. If it's a DigiCert certificate, you can find their intermediate certs here. There's probably also a way to export this from the Windows server, but I'm not familiar enough with it.\n\n*It's possible Server.app is getting confused by the file extension. Try renaming it from .pfx to .p12 (they both refer to the same file format, PKCS #12).\n\n*There might also be something odd about the file contents. Since it sounds like it imports ok via Keychain Access, try importing it with that, then re-exporting it to .p12 (see the instructions you linked), then delete it from the keychain (to avoid a conflict) and re-import it with Server.app. It's possible importing and exporting with Keychain Access will clean up the file and make it work properly in Server.app as well.\n", "Q: Proxy Login Popups on Mavericks I have updated my Mac OS  from Snow Leapord to Mevericks recently.

Is there a good backup software that combines Time Machine snapshot functionality on local level with CrashPlan remote backups as well? I am currently using both, but find both unsatisfactory.\nMy main problem with Time Machine is that it consumes a lot of resources and not playing nice. I have a pretty new beefy MacBook and I just know when TM starts running. Everything gets slow and it heats up. Check the processes, and sure enough backupd is at the top.\nWith CrashPlan I have less of a problem. It is generally very nice piece of software. But recently it is getting stuck for some reason and only know when I get notification by email that there were no backups for 2-3 days. Also it is quite bulky, and also UI is very ugly and not Mac-like.\nAny recommendations?\nThanks!\n\nA: I am a big fan of Arq (http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/), which works just like TimeMachine but with remote backups on Amazon S3/Glacier.\n\nA: Try out SuperDuper!, a free-if-you-want-it-and-paid-if-you-want-additional-features app. Go to the nearest electronic store and grab yourself a external hard drive if you don't have one. (Judging by crashplan and time machine backups, I assume you have one.)\nWhen you come inside SuperDuper, then click from, and then choose your hard drive. At the to, click disk image.\nThen, make a disk image on the new external drive or time capsule or whatever, and then name it the time and date at your time zone. Then click copy.\nNow, every time you launch the app, make sure you make another disk image to prevent overwriting.\n\nA: Time Machine supports remote backups with some limitations (many of which have workarounds). I've been using it over LAN for a while with no problems and not too much CPU usage, so I'm not sure why you're having CPU usage problems.\nThe best alternative IMO is Carbon Copy Cloner. It supports remote backups and gives you tons of customization including fully bootable backups (unlike TM), though it has no \"snapshot\" feature like Time Machine. It was freeware but is now $30, BUT you can still download the old freeware version (3.4.7) from here. It's no longer supported and claims that it's meant for 10.4 and 10.5, but I've been using it forever in 10.6 through 10.9 with no problems and have relied on its bootable backups several times.\nAnother answer mentions SuperDuper!. I haven't used it in a long time, but I remember it not being as good. Can't hurt to try both.\n", "Q: How to fix iBooks \"Two pages\" mode I have a number of books in iBooks on my MacBook.

After installing the iCloud panel for Windows and activating calendar sync Office got my personal calendars, but iCloud still does not know about the appointments I got in my Outlook calendar.\nIs there something I missed?\n\nA: I think that there is a better way for you to configure this to work smoothly for you.\nThe pre-smartphone method of getting calendar data onto a phone (or the Palm Pilot's of the past) was to \"sync\" the device with a computer using a physical cable.  In this setup, the computer was the central repository of information.  The reason for this was simply that old Palm devices simply didn't have an Internet connection of their own like modern smartphones do.  Put simply, modern smartphones should rarely be \"synched\" with a computer any more to exchange data.\nInstead, your iPhone is as capable as your computer to connect directly to your work server to exchange calendar data.  You iPhone is also capable of having multiple email/server accounts (i.e a connection to iCloud, another to your work server, and possibly another to a Gmail or Yahoo mail account).\nTherefore, the solution to your configuration problem is simple.  Set up your iPhone in Mail/Calendar/Contacts settings to connect to your iCloud account, and then set up a second account to connect with your work's server (Exchange)?  Your iPhone will then get calendar data right from the two source servers over the Internet (no more sync cables needed).  The iPhone will then overlay the calendar data from both accounts.  It will also allow you to show or hide each calendar separately, or simply see them both in the same calendar.  When you create a calendar event from the iPhone, you can even choose which calendar it belongs to.\nOn your computer, you should do the same.  Set up Outlook to get email/calendars/contacts directly from the iCloud server, and also from your work server.\nOnce you have your computer and your iPhone connecting directly with the servers then calendars, email, and contacts will always be current and \"in sync\" thereafter.\n\nA: What worked for me was to go into settings, iCloud, then click on delete account which will delete your email account with iCloud. Then go back into settings and login again with your email account and it worked perfectly after that\n", "Q: How can I delete an iOS app and preserve its data? I have a 16 GB iPhone and there are a few sizable (~1 GB) games that I have not played lately, but I would like to preserve my progress in case I play them again at some future time.\nThese games do not store progress in iCloud or some other network service; they appear to save only to the device.  If I delete them from the device, either from the springboard or with iTunes, their data is lost; it does not appear to be preserved in the iTunes backup.\nWhat can I do to preserve data but free space on my device?\n\nA: Make sure you are on iOS 11, then got to Settings>General>iPad Storage Tap the app,then tap Offload App\n\n\nA: I've found I can use iExplorer to make copies of preferences files, etc.\nThe (somewhat tedious) click-driven process is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start iExplorer, navigate to device, Apps.\n\n*Locate the app to back up data for.  (This can be tricky, as not all apps are named internally similarly to their friendly public name.)\n\n*Browse the app contents.  Generally, game progress is stored in Library/Preferences.\n\n*Drag the appropriate files to a local disk for safekeeping.\n\n*Delete the app.\n\n*When the app is reinstalled later, drag the files back in their previous place and restart the app.\niExplorer also has a mode for automatically mounting one of its folders as a FUSE for OSX volume when an iOS device is connected; this allows me to connect my device and then use the command line to more efficiently back up and restore documents and preferences.\n", "Q: how to upgrade unlocked iphone 4s to iOS 7.0.4 How to upgrade my iphone 4s currently running on iOS 5.0 to iOS 7.0.4?

Every file on Drive2013 is read-only and must remain that way. When I drag a file from Drive2013 to Drive2014, I need the file to inherit the permissions from it's new home on Drive2014.\nI tried How do I use chmod on a Mac to make new files inherit parent directory permissions? but this is only applicable after the file has been copied.\nSomeone mentioned that what I want to do is feasible through Apple's Server Admin Tools. I'm running the latest version of OS X Mavericks Server all up to date.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Server.app and select your server from the services list.\n\n*Go to the Storage tab.\n\n*Browse to the folder location that you wish to inherit permissions from.\n\n*Click the gear at the bottom, and select Propagate Permissions…\n\n*Choose the permissions you wish to propagate and click OK.\n\n\nA: What you need to use is ACLs (instead of POSIX) permissions.  Luckily, you don't need Mac OS server to use ACLs.  They are available right from the Terminal of any recent Mac OS X version.  From Terminal, you will simply use the \"chmod\" command to apply ACLs to your Drive2014.  The ACL command you will use should include \",file_inherit,directory_inherit,\".\nFull details of the \"chmod\" command are available here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/chmod.1.html\nAnd, the perfect solution to your question (with command examples) has already been answered well here:\nHow do I use chmod on a Mac to make new files inherit parent directory permissions?\nMake sure to read that post to the end as they have made a few corrections along the way.\n\nA: sudo serveradmin settings smb:directorymask = 775\nsudo serveradmin settings smb:creationmask = 775\n\nA: I found a simple solution that allows you to designate a permission to parent folders and ensure that all contents will inherit those permissions.  In your case, you want two parent folder with distinct sharing permissions (Drive 2013 and Drive 2014 folders).  \n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, right click on the desired parent folder and select \"Get Info.\"\n\n*You may have to click the padlock icon located at the bottom right of the info screen and enter the admin password to make changes.\n\n*Make the desired revisions to the sharing permissions, and remember that the next step will propagate those sharing permissions into every file and subfolder contained within the parent folder.\n\n*Click on the utility icon at the bottom of the info screen (shaped like a gear) and click \"apply to enclosed items.\"  The system will notify you that all content within the parent folder will inherit the same sharing permissions, and this is what you want.\nYou can follow the same steps for both the 2013 and 2014 folders and set different permission for each.  If you drag a file from the 2013 folder and drop it in the 2014 folder, the file will inherit the sharing permissions of the 2014 folder.\nThis link may explain this better than I did: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1549\n", "Q: How do I erase partitions on a drive that's been protected with FileVault 2? I want to completely wipe a USB thumb drive, re-partition it, and reformat the partition as ExFAT, not JHFS+.

That would allow you to surgically remove the core storage.\nYou could also unmount the filesystems and nuke/pave the drive:\ndiskutil unmountDisk disk6\ndiskutil partitionDisk disk6 GPT ExFAT Files 16g\n\n", "Q: How can I force a Mac laptop to shutdown when the battery is below 25%? It is common wisdom that Lithium-Ion batteries should not be left with 0% charge.\nHowever, some users might not be aware of this common wisdom, or simply refuse to concern themselves about proper battery care. For example, an end-user may drain the battery to 0%, then put the computer away without putting it back on the charge. This rapidly diminishes the life of the battery.\nIs there any app or setting that will force the computer to turn off when the battery charge is around 25%, to ensure that a healthy reserve is available and damage to the battery is avoided?\n\nA: I haven't tested this, although something such as this should work:\nproperty lowBattery : 25\n\non idle\n    set battStatus to do shell script \"pmset -g ps\"\n    if battStatus contains \"InternalBattery\" then\n        set {TID, text item delimiters} to {text item delimiters, \";\"}\n        set battStatus to text items of battStatus\n        set text item delimiters to space\n        set battStatus to text 1 thru -2 of last text item of item 1 of battStatus as integer\n        set text item delimiters to TID\n        -- Shutdown if battery is less than 25%\n        if battStatus < lowBattery then tell application \"loginwindow\" to «event aevtrsdn»\n    end if\n    return 60\nend idle\n\nIn AppleScript editor save it as an Application using Stay open run handler, then add it to your Login Items under System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\nA: I don't have any sources I can reference to support this claim, other than my experience with other systems that rely on lithium-ion batteries, but I would guess that the percentage charge that you see in the menu bar isn't the actual state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery. Apple has probably accounted for the fact that having a battery run to 0% SOC  is hard on the battery, so when you see 3% indicated in the menu bar, the actual battery SOC might be 10 or 20%. The same thing might be true for 100% SOC (which is also hard on the battery).\nI realize I'm not exactly answering your question, but I think Apple probably already has done the due diligence you're proposing to protect the life of the battery.\n\nA: Have a look at SleepOnLowBattery (“SOLB”):\nhttps://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/release-sleeponlowbattery-solb.264785/\nor\nhttps://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/336414-release-sleeponlowbattery-%E2%80%9Csolb%E2%80%9D/\nIt's open source and you can adapt anything to your liking.\n", "Q: Is there any way to access display settings from the menu bar in Mavericks?

On my wife's machine (2012 MB Pro) she cannot rename a bookmark folder she creates in Google Chrome. All her new bookmark folders are called new folder. This has been happening for awhile. I run 10.7.5 on a 2008 MB Pro and don't have this problem. I suppose deleting Chrome and re-installing is the best solution?\n\nA: I would highly advice against re-installing chrome. \nWhat I've found is that this feature is hidden and not very intuitive, but it's there. All you have to do, believe it or not, is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Bookmark manager (Ctrl+Shift+O) \n\n*Click on the name of the folder(right above your google icon)\n\n*Rename to your liking\n\n\nFor the official instructions.\nThat's it. You can't hit F2 when a folder is selected, which is a mystery to me. Renaming can also be done in a more painful manner through the bookmarks bar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Bookmarks Bar (Crtl+Shift+B)\n\n*Right click on the folder\n\n*Choose rename\n\n\nThese are the only two ways about it to my knowledge.\n\nA: Try this:\n1) Go to Chrome's Bookmark Manager, \"Organize\" menu, and export her bookmarks as an HTML file (save this file for later).\n2) Exit Chrome completely\n3) Click on your Desktop, then from the Finder menu click \"Go\" > \"Go To Folder\".\n4) Enter ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/ in the box then click the \"Go\" button (this will take you to where Chrome stores her user profile settings.\n5) Rename the file called \"Bookmarks\" to \"Bookmarks.OLD\" and \"Bookmarks.bak\" to \"Bookmarks.bak.OLD\"\n6) Launch Chrome\n7) Go to Chrome's Bookmark Manager, \"Organize\" menu, and import the bookmarks_x_x_x.html file that you saved earlier.\n8) Exit Chrome completely again.  Wait a few seconds, then launch it again.\n9) Now try to use Chrome's Bookmark manager to create a new folder and rename it.\nHopefully the problem will be solved.\n", "Q: Will Time Machine restore the \"Date Created\" field along with the restored files?

I created a spreadsheet in November 2013, then deleted it a couple of weeks back. I've just restored it (because I didn't know the answer to this question!) and the Date Created says 17 November 2013.\nSince Time Machine changes between OS X versions, I can't say that this will be the case for older versions, but I imagine it should be.\n", "Q: What file sharing protocol should I use with an older Mac? I understand that Apple has switched to SMB2 as their default file sharing protocol these days, but I have an old Mac at home that I want to share files with, and it can only run OS X 10.6.\nOS X 10.6 gives me the option of using AFP, FTP, or SMB (version 1, I believe).  Is there a reason to choose one of these over the others?\n\nA: AFP is Apple File Protocol and has been the default for a long time, and will be the most compatible with your 10.6 computer, and probably the easiest to set up. If you are sharing files on your own home network, choose that. It is still compatible with 10.9, it's just not the default network protocol in 10.9. SMB, the common Windows protocol, is available, but does not support some of the \"nice\" features of Mac OSX; sometimes it won't display custom icons, and might not fully support some file resource forks. FTP is more common for internet based networking, and I see no reason to use that in a home-only setting.\n", "Q: Is there any way to enable microsoft silverlight in IOS?

The issue is well known\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ts4088\n\nA: It could be a memory problem too …\nTry it, and load memory with prime95 to check stability (under heavy load = heat).\nPRAM reset and SMC reset are welcome.\nCheck also (disk utility) the hard disk.\nYou have to check the pyramid base …\nif it is OK, then you can check software issue …\n\nA: This is a known problem from Apple. I made a program to fix this issue. You can check it out here, it's free and open-source : https://github.com/julian-poidevin/MBPMid2010_GPUFix/\n", "Q: Time Machine couldn't complete backup I keep getting this message:\n￼\nI understood that when T M filled the target disc, it would delete the oldest backups to make space for later backups. This is fine with me, and I would be quite happy if it just did that. But it keeps warning me with this screen. I can not find a way to stop this so I have to click OK very time, sometime 20  times a day. \nI have a 1T HDD with 300Gb free and a 1T backup disc. \nIs there a way to stop this warning appearing?\n\nA: When Time Machine begins a backup, it first 'prepares' the backup. It's at this point that the space requirements are calculated. If there's not enough space, it will delete old backups, and tell you so, including the date of the last backup that's left on the drive.\nHowever, your error is that it's run out of space unexpectedly. This is much more rare.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try repairing your drive with Disk Utility\nThere might be a problem with the disk and/or partition, where directories are smaller than they might first appear. Try repairing it.\n\n*Another process is writing to the drive\nMake sure that nothing else is being saved to the partition at the same time. If another process writes a big file to the partition, then the space requirements won't match, and you'll get this error.\n", "Q: Airplay without itunes I have some remote speakers hooked up to an Airport Express. While they work with iTunes as intended, I would like to stream sound that I play in other applications. Is there some facility for using the remote speakers from the rest of the system?\nFrom googling (nothing found so far) and looking at this question, I get the impression that no ready-to-use solution is provided by Apple. Assuming this is the case, I'd be curious about commandline-oriented or implementation-level information: What do the remote speakers look like to the iTunes API? How does OS X handle sound output, and is there any chance of arranging for remote speakers to be exposed as a sound device at the OS level? I'm currently running Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).\nUpdate: a) Thanks to @TonyWilliams, I now know about AirPlay, a third party solution. Still hoping for information on doing it directly, though. b) I've also come across this question, which would allow a bit of commandline access to the airplay speakers (if I can get it to work).\n\nA: You can simply go to System Preferences → Sound → Output and choose your output device. Lag applies here too.\n\n\nA: There is a commercial solution, Airfoil from Rogue Amoeba will send your audio out via Airplay. $25.\nhttp://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/\nThey also offer a free utility to turn your Mac into AirPlay speakers.\n(Note that there is a noticeable lag so it's not good for such things as watching video on the Mac or playing games, but it's fine for audio from apps like Spotify.)\n", "Q: How can I list my open network ports with netstat?

But I'm struggling to get any useful information out of it.\nHow can I list my open ports with netstat? Any specific flags that helps me in this case?\n\nA: Based on @kroolk's great answer, I would suggest this one-liner:\nnetstat -Watnlv | grep LISTEN | awk '{\"ps -ww -o args= -p \" $9 | getline procname;colred=\"\\033[01;31m\";colclr=\"\\033[0m\"; print colred \"proto: \" colclr $1 colred \" | addr.port: \" colclr $4 colred \" | pid: \" colclr $9 colred \" | name: \" colclr procname;  }' | column -t -s \"|\"\n...which will not truncate the output of  ps (at least on my mac) and give the full command including arguments :-)\n\nA: netstat -anvp tcp | awk 'NR<3 || /LISTEN/'\nActive Internet connections (including servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)     rhiwat shiwat    pid   epid  state    options\ntcp46      0      0  *.62981                *.*                    LISTEN      131072 131072  34548      0 0x0100 0x00000006\n…\n\n\nsudo lsof -PiTCP -sTCP:LISTEN\nCOMMAND     PID      USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nBetterTou 34548 grgarside   20u  IPv4 0xa42a1d0ade5d3585      0t0  TCP *:62981 (LISTEN)\nBetterTou 34548 grgarside   21u  IPv6 0xa42a1d0ad67f7a5d      0t0  TCP *:62981 (LISTEN)\n…\n\n\nA: First, I'm not a BSD expert, but like the OP I wanted the rough equivalent of running the following on a *nix box, or something close:\nnetstat -tulpn\n\nI read other questions/answers offering lsof* and netstat* on MacOS, and I still wanted something with more compact output. So, this is what I quick put together:\nnetstat -Watnlv | grep LISTEN | awk '{\"ps -o comm= -p \" $9 | getline procname;colred=\"\\033[01;31m\";colclr=\"\\033[0m\"; print cred \"proto: \" colclr $1 colred \" | addr.port: \" colclr $4 colred \" | pid: \" colclr $9 colred \" | name: \" colclr procname;  }' | column -t -s \"|\"\n\nIt's a bit overkill, so I added color to the output for good measure. Since I'm not going to be able to remember, or want to type, this behemoth. I put it in a bash function and then just call that when needed. Here is said bash function:\nmacnst (){\n    netstat -Watnlv | grep LISTEN | awk '{\"ps -o comm= -p \" $9 | getline procname;colred=\"\\033[01;31m\";colclr=\"\\033[0m\"; print colred \"proto: \" colclr $1 colred \" | addr.port: \" colclr $4 colred \" | pid: \" colclr $9 colred \" | name: \" colclr procname;  }' | column -t -s \"|\"\n}\n\nI have a small collection of these convenience functions in a file that I source from ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.zshrc. This is being added to the collection. It'd be interesting to see other opportunities to make this nicer/slimmer. \nSample Output:\n> macns\nproto: tcp4     addr.port: 127.0.0.1.9999     pid: 70078    name:  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_162.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\nproto: tcp46    addr.port: *.35729            pid: 70078    name:  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_162.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\nproto: tcp46    addr.port: *.62087            pid: 70078    name:  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_162.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\nproto: tcp46    addr.port: *.62070            pid: 70078    name:  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_162.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\nproto: tcp46    addr.port: *.62085            pid: 70078    name:  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_162.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\nproto: tcp4     addr.port: *.61993            pid: 70043    name:  /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/MacOS/idea\nproto: tcp46    addr.port: *.61992            pid: 70065    name:  /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java\nproto: tcp4     addr.port: 127.0.0.1.42329    pid: 70065    name:  /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java\nproto: tcp4     addr.port: 127.0.0.1.61983    pid: 70043    name:  /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java\nproto: tcp4     addr.port: 127.0.0.1.63342    pid: 70043    name:  /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java\nproto: tcp4     addr.port: 127.0.0.1.6942     pid: 70043    name:  /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java\nproto: tcp4     addr.port: 127.0.0.1.3075     pid: 67931    name:  /Applications/electerm.app/Contents/Frameworks/electerm Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/electerm Helper\nproto: tcp6     addr.port: *.58640            pid: 320      name:  /usr/libexec/rapportd\nproto: tcp4     addr.port: *.58640            pid: 320      name:  /usr/libexec/rapportd\nproto: tcp4     addr.port: 127.0.0.1.9770     pid: 71       name:  /Applications/Pritunl.app/Contents/Resources/pritunl-service\n\n\nA: The simplest method is to use netstat:\n$ netstat -ap tcp\nActive Internet connections (including servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)    \ntcp4       0      0  10.0.2.23.58792        17.172.233.109.5223    ESTABLISHED\ntcp4      87      0  my_iMac__at_home.55481 stackoverflow.co.http  ESTABLISHED\ntcp4     116      0  my_iMac__at_home.55478 stackoverflow.co.http  ESTABLISHED\ntcp4      58      0  my_iMac__at_home.63452 stackoverflow.co.http  ESTABLISHED\ntcp4      87      0  my_iMac__at_home.63429 stackoverflow.co.http  ESTABLISHED\ntcp4       0      0  localhost.63173        localhost.773          ESTABLISHED\ntcp4       0      0  localhost.773          localhost.63173        ESTABLISHED\ntcp4       0      0  localhost.63173        *.*                    LISTEN     \ntcp4       0      0  localhost.63172        *.*                    LISTEN     \ntcp4       0      0  localhost.ipp          *.*                    LISTEN     \ntcp6       0      0  localhost.ipp          *.*                    LISTEN     \n\n…without any added filtering, so as to get the correct headers, and\nto see both servers listening, and connections already established in both directions.\nIn this example, the 1st line exhibits a connexion from my Mac toward\n17.172.233.109, which a further:\nwhois 17.172.233.109\n\ntaught me it is located at Apple.\n\nA: maybe you can use lsof:\nlsof -Pn -i4\n\n-i4 means only show ipv4 address and ports\n-P and -n fast output\noutput like this\n➜  lsof -Pn -i4 | grep LISTEN\nQQPlatfor 22767 xxxx   15u  IPv4 0x36c2bfa04e49385d      0t0  TCP *:49969 (LISTEN)\nGoAgentX  33377 xxxx    4u  IPv4 0x36c2bfa06e68b12d      0t0  TCP *:56154 (LISTEN)\nGoAgentX  33377 xxxx   20u  IPv4 0x36c2bfa04e492f8d      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:56155 (LISTEN)\n\n", "Q: GarageBand Static when recording guitar using JAM 96k interface Does anybody know how to resolve the intermittent static problem when recording on the Mac using Garageband 10.0.1 on a Mavericks MAC and using Apogee JAM 96k? I've tried every configuration possible (different sample rates, different bit depths, removing effects, changing guitar and interface cables etc...) to no avail. Cannot get ride of this annoying static.\n\nA: Check the bit rate of garage band verses your interface. If garage band is recording at 24 bit and your interface is 16 bit, you might get static, especially if you have a lots of tracks. AC\n\nA: This was happening to me too with the original Jam and Garageband 2 with Yosemite.\nIn Preferences->Audio/Midi, I deselected Jam as the input, then selected it again after a few moments.\nEDIT:\nChanging the bit rate from 24 to 16-bit in Preferences also helped. \nEarlier, I was receiving cyclical static whenever I played a note- my first solution addressed that for me.\nI think changing the bit-rate addresses the intermittent static that the OP was actually referring to. I mixed them up because they both sounded similar.\n\nA: I had the same problem in Yosemite. I turned off the 24-bit option, restarted Garageband, and still had the problem. I then shut my whole computer down and restarted. Now it is gone. I think that when you set the bit rate to 16, you must restart the computer to get it to take affect. \n\nA: Matching up the bit rates was the key for me. Input for the jam was 24, and the output for my headphones was at 16. Just changed the output to 24 so they match... and voila! Original Apogee Jam and 2015 MacBook running macOS Sierra.\n", "Q: Restore User License From Time Machine Backup I bought a used MacBook.  The nice thing was it came with the complete Adobe Suite 5.  But Apple reformatted the disk to fix a problem.  When I did Time Machine the Adobe license number came up, but it said it was invalid. \nI contacted Adobe and they said the license was registered to another user.  I guess that's the previous owner.  Is there anyway I can get Time Machine to restore it so the apps work?\n\nA: From the CS5 US License document:\n\nYOU WILL NOT RENT, LEASE, SELL, SUBLICENSE, ASSIGN OR\n  TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS IN THE SOFTWARE, OR AUTHORIZE ANY PORTION OF THE\n  SOFTWARE TO BE COPIED ONTO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY’S\n  COMPUTER EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREIN. You may,\n  however, permanently transfer all your rights to use the Software to\n  another individual or legal entity provided that: (a) you also\n  transfer (i) this agreement, (ii) the serial number(s), the Software\n  affixed to media provided by Adobe or its authorized distributor, and\n  all other software or hardware bundled, packaged or pre-installed with\n  the Software, including all copies, upgrades, updates, and prior\n  versions, and (iii) all copies of font software converted into other\n  formats to such individual or entity; (b) you retain no upgrades,\n  updates or copies, including backups and copies stored on a Computer;\n  and (c) the receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this\n  agreement and any other terms and conditions under which you purchased\n  a valid license to the Software.\n\nIf the license code does not work, you're out of luck unless you can get the license code from the previous owner and the media (CD or DVD installer discs.)\n\nA: Contact Adobe for your version of Creative Suite 5, if you can send them screenshots of purchased disks, serial or 'something' vaguely concrete, you can download the disk image, and they will give you a license, providing everything is legitimate. I'm in a similar situation after a Mac restore, but I'd prefer NOT to WASTE another of my 3 installations, leaving only one, just because Apple and Adobe don't bother to inform you that you will lose licensing for most software if you back-up though the semi-unless Time Machine or Migration 'Assistant'. I've ostensibly lost All OF creative Suite, and I use Photoshop everyday, and there different installations/ versions of Lightroom, containing around 16,000 image files. I 've had this issue for a month, and the Apple Tech guys remotely accessing my screen to 'help', same with Adobe, except Adobe DO ACTUALLY take control, whereas Apple just use the pointer, and give you 'instructions, when, in reality, they know that resistance is futile. I just wish I new Time Machine was such Pants!\n", "Q: Piping multiple commands I would like to run the following command and pipe stout of both to TextEdit:\npmset -g; echo; pmset -g assertions | open -f -a TextEdit \n\nThis doesn't work, it only executes the latter:\nHow?\n\nA: ()'s combine the commands into a single process, concatenating them to stdout:\n(pmset -g; echo; pmset -g assertions) | open -f -a TextEdit\n\n\nA: Aahhh, bash redirection :- \n( pmset -g && echo && pmset -g assertions ) | open -f -a TextEdit\n\nThat runs your commands as a single bash command (that's the effect of &&) in a sub-shell (which is what wrapping it in the () does) and redirects the output of the sub-shell into TextEdit for you. You technically don't have to use && instead of ; but the effect of changing it is that if any of the commands fail it will stop the entire chain at that point.\nNote: In your example all the commands are being run (as you can prove by just running pmset -g; echo; pmset -g assertions at the command line), it's just that you are applying the pipe to only the last one. That's why it needs to be run in a subshell.\nNote: that you could replace the | character with > and send the output to a file if you wish.\n", "Q: Can I transfer a PDF to iPhone then use gmail to send it by email? I have a PC running Windows. It has iTunes installed. This PC does not and cannot have any Internet connectivity.\nI have an iPhone 4s. (Not jail broken).\nThere is a PDF file on the PC. I want to transfer that file to the iPhone. Then I want to send it by email. (Preferably the gmail app).\nI can use iTunes to transfer the PDF to the iPhone, but the PDF reader app has control of that file and nothing else can access it.  And it seems like the gmail app can't attach anything other than photos?\nIs there a way to do this? Or should I give up with this approach?\n\nA: The commercial answer is to install a good quality PDF viewer. Even better would be to install GoodReader which started out as a PDF handler but can now handle a number of different file types and do any number of things with them, including email.\nhttp://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreader-for-iphone/id306277111?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\n\nA: Try Adobe Reader. You can use iTunes to transfer PDF files to and from it and  send them by email too.

It seems like this question has been asked a million times, but after a few hours of reading similar questions, I have not been able to find a clear answer.\nI have a mid-2012 Macbook Air running OS X 10.9. I want to run dual 24\" 1920x1200 monitors and the built-in 11\" screen.\nCan I use a thunderbolt RAID device (i.e. Promise Pegasus R4 or anything else with two thunderbolt ports out) to drive two monitors?\nWill this work:\nMBA -> RAID -> 2x miniDP to DVI adaptors -> 2x 24\" screens\n\nA: No, not with the Promise Pegasus R4 has only two Thunderbolt ports. One you will need to connect to the MBA and then other to your miniDP adapter. You would need a Thunderbolt dock that has another Thunderbolt port or another video interface like HDMI, etc.\nSomething like this: http://www.caldigit.com/thunderboltstation/,etc\n", "Q: Deleting of photos on iOS When photos on iOS are added to an album, does that duplicate the amount of space being used? If I add the photos to another app, can I delete them from the camera roll?\n\nA: No, when photos from the Camera Roll are added to an album, it does not result in double the storage space being used. The Photos.app just tracks those photos as being part of that album, in addition to being in the Camera Roll (which is the default album). Note that if you delete these photos from the Camera Roll, they will get deleted from the album too (because there's actually only one copy of the photos on the device).\nIf you add photos from the Camera Roll to another app and save, the other app receives its own copy of the photo. You can then delete the photos from the Camera Roll and have them only in the other app.\n", "Q: iPhone controlling iPad remotely: something like Hamachi I have searched for this around the web, but haven't found anything that was similar to what I was looking for. So here it goes.\nSuppose I have one iPhone and one iPad, both being jailbroken. The iPhone is in the network A, while the iPad is in network B. Both networks have access to the Internet. My objective is to control the iPad using the iPhone. I should see the screen of the iPad on my iPhone and be able to run and control apps and input text.\nDoes anyone if this is possible (with the restrictions described above)?\n\nA: There are two questions there. First:\nHow can I control my iPad from my iPhone\nSince you have jailbroken the phone then the answer is to install Veency :\nhttp://cydia.saurik.com/info/veency/ though I'm not sure it supports iOS7 yet.\nThe second:\nHow can I get VNC working across the internet?\nYou will have to configure port forwarding on the network that contains the iPad so that any VNC traffic that hits your home router goes to the phone. VNC usually lives on port 500 and last I checked Veency didn't allow you to change it.\n", "Q: iTunes starts playing music without explanation For no apparent reason, iTunes starts playing music on my iMac running OS X 10.9.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2119211?start=15&tstart=0\nI have to close itunes 10 times an hour. How do I fix this?\n\nA: First step would be to turn off the IR receiver and BlueTooth.\nThe infra-red receiver can be disabled in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Advanced. BlueTooth in System Preferences > BlueTooth.\nYou might also try cleaning out the headphone port (gently) with a toothpick and some rubbing alcohol and plugging in a set of headphones.\nAll of this is to make sure that some extraneous hardware input isn't causing the problem.\nIf that doesn't fix it then run Activity Monitor and kill the process iTunes Helper and see what happens. If it's something in the System then iTunes Helper will rerun when the problem occurs. If it's a problem with iTunes Helper then killing it should stop the problem. Of course iTunes Helper will rerun when you reboot or run iTunes manually but you will at least get more information.\n\nA: I experienced this same problem and frustrated to no end.  \nSpecifically for me, I have a jambox that I use for conference calling on my iphone as well as listening to music, news, etc.  While the device is paired to both my iphone and my macbook, the jambox for whatever reason is telling my macbook to keep starting itunes and plying a song.  I don't tell the jambox to do this by pushing any buttons, it just does it by itself.  As a result, the jambox is unpaired from my macbook.  something is flaky and I don't have the time to chase it down but the fix is to manually unpairing of the jabot from both devices does it for me.  \nHope it helps somebody else and save you a bunch of time and frustration trying to keep the device paired with two music sources. \n\nA: I have my Mac connected to my Bose Bluetooth speaker. After a while of non-use, the Bose automatically shuts down. For some reason, this signals iTunes to start playing through the Mac speakers. I don't know how to prevent that, but that's what I figured out was happening. \n", "Q: 64bit vs 32bit on mobile devices with 2gb ram - is there any sense? Today I took part in an interesting discussion. Someone said that's great that Apple goes 64bit with their iPhone 5S. Of course I mentioned about no need for 64bits paired with 2 gigs of RAM, but then I started to wonder - is there anything good with 64bit in this case, except for benefits of \"future compatibility\"? Larger instructions? Any kind of optimalization?\n\nA: Since the iPhone doesn't use an x86 processor, almost everything you know about 64-bit versus 32-bit will not apply. For example, on x86 processors, more general purpose registers are available in 64-bit mode. This provides a performance boost in 64-bit mode. That doesn't apply to non-x86 processors.\n64-bit operation tends to provide benefits to software that handles \"bulk data\". This generally includes things like encryption, compression, and image processing. Other types of programming don't significantly benefit because they seldom deal with values that occupy more than 32-bits. Also, more memory bandwidth is required by 64-bit code because all pointers are twice as large and this can cause some performance loss.\nHowever, there is one big advantage of 64-bit code over 32-bit code -- virtual memory need not be treated as a scarce resource. This can have all kinds of benefits both for performance, ease of development, reliability, maintainability, and so on. For example, if you're manipulating a large database file, you can memory-map the entire file and access it just like an array. This can eliminate a lot of slow, complex, error-prone code to memory map sections of the file or alternate seeks with data operations.\nSimilarly, libraries can have fixed virtual addresses. This can improve code sharing and result in memory being used more effectively. It can minimize relocation, which can result in faster code startup.\nTo be honest, you would have to know a lot about the internals of how the device operates, both in software and in hardware, to usefully opine on whether a change from a 32-bit platform to a 64-bit platform will provide significant benefits.\n\nA: No. Actually it hurts - as 64 bit programs are larger. And if you are so space constrained....\nLikely a strategiy move for long term compatiblity assuming that the next generation will maybe have more than 4gb.\n\nA: I'm thinking I'll regret this answer... here goes:\nYes, the \"sense\" is marketing. 64 bit is a fantastic keyword! Bigger, better, moar, and 99.7% of the iPhone buying public will think this.\nRules and values of big business:\n1- Marketing/brand image\n2- Marketing/brand image\n3- Accounting\n4- Lawyers\n5- Engineering\nI would have +1d the question because I almost always as a rule will +1 questions I answer; however:\n\nis there anything good with 64bit in this case, except for benefits of\n  \"future compatibility\"\n\nThere is no future compatibility with mobile devices.\n", "Q: Manually set iTunes play/pause button I'm using an old Apple USB keyboard(it came with the iMac G5) with my Mac.  I'd like to bind F16 to play/pause iTunes, like F8 key on the MacBooks.  Right now the key does nothing.\nI'm OK with 3rd party software/plugins.\n\nA: The best solution for this is Karabiner (formerly known as KeyRemap4MacBook).\nIt allows you to do all sorts of great remapping, including this one. It isn't the easiest thing in the world to set up though. Using it and writing your own custom keybindings file almost anything is possible.\nFor a commercial solution that also does a great deal more and is easier to deal with you could use Keyboard Maestro, which I consider almost essential on a Mac.\n", "Q: Mac Grapher Complex Error Function I understand the the Grapher app in Mac OS X comes with erf and erfc, the error function and complementary error function. However, when I define\ny = Re[erfc(-ix)],\n\nthe Grapher app just returns y(x) = 0 for all values of x. Is it not possible to give this function complex values?\n\nA: You may well find that somewhere in there the complex number is being flattened and you will need to use the complex() function to protect it from that.\nCheck this out :- \nhttp://acko.net/blog/taming-complex-numbers-in-grapher-app/\n", "Q: No password required after Power Nap I have enabled the setting Require password 1 minute after sleep or screen saver begins. However, I sometimes noticed that my password is not asked after I open my laptop in the morning. This seems to coincide with Power Nap runs: if you open the laptop during that period, or probably in the minute after it goes back to sleep (checked using the Console: RTC: Maintenance), the password is not asked.\nIs this a bug/feature, or is there another setting I'm missing? Can others confirm this? (There is a simple test to find out when your computer is in Power Nap.)\n\nA: I tried asking a similar question on the Apple discussion forum but wasn't allowed. It seems to be a bug. If you log out and log in the settings work as they should, at least they did in my case.\nI could put my MBP (2010, running Yosemite) to sleep via the menu, close the lid or simply let it go to screen saver and then sleep, let it stand over night and still not be asked for my password, so I don't think its only a Power Nap issue.\n", "Q: Sourcing a replacement graphics card for an iMac I have a Early-2009 2.93 GHz 24\" iMac, which has a faulty graphics card.\nI'm keen to try replacing it myself using this excellent guide. Unfortunately the guide doesn't mention any advice on finding/buying a replacement card.\nWhere can I find a card to buy online (or locally), and what do I have to check to know that the card will be an appropriate replacement?\n\nA: There were three gfx card options that went in this model:\n\n\n*\n\n*NVIDIA GT120 (256Mb): part #661-4991\n\n*NVIDIA GT130 (512Mb): part #661-4990\n\n*ATI Radeon HD 4850 (512Mb): part #661-5135\n\n\nSearching for these cards by this \"Apple Part Number\" yields many online sellers.

I prefer to use my laptop as a desktop. So I have a docking station for my Dell which I used to connect to 2 external monitors, keyboard and mouse. I use both OS X as well as Windows via Boot Camp.\nIs there anything similar for new MacBook Pro (Retina)? \nIf not a docking station what would be better alternative to connect 2 external Dell monitors (supporting resolution of 1920 * 1080)?\n\nA: You're looking for a HengeDock Retina Dock. I have one similar, except mine is for a previous version of Macbook instead of Retina.\nYou can pre-order them on their site.\n\nA: If you have an Apple Thunderbolt Display, then you don't need a dock at all. You simply plug the display into one of the Thunderbolt ports of the Mac, and use the display as the dock. It has lots of ports on the back - including several USB ports, a gigabit Ethernet port, another Thunderbolt port, etc.\nYou can plug another Thunderbolt display (daisy-chained) into the Thunderbolt port of the display, or if you have a DVI display you can plug that into the second Thunderbolt port of the MacBook Pro with an adapter, or you could plug an HDMI monitor into the HDMI port on the right-hand side of the Mac.\nYou can also daisy chain an HDMI or DVI monitor via the Thunderbolt display, but only if it goes via an additional device.\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro Retina. I connected a 27\" Asus Display directly to the HDMI port, and a 27\" Samsung Display to the Thunderbolt port through a DVI to VGA adapter.\nI now have three displays stacked horizontally, with quite some nice real estate. Both external displays are 1920 x 1080 and have the Mac with Retina resolution of 2560 x 1600. You can do at least the same with your 15\" MacBook Pro Retina.\nHope this helps!!\n\nA: Belkin offer the Thunderbolt Express Dock which will do what you want.\nhttp://www.belkin.com/au/p/P-F4U055/\nMatrox have a similar product but it has less ports.\nhttp://www.matrox.com/docking_station/en/ds1/\nI was not able to confirm either can run two monitors but at worst you would have to plug the other monitor into the other Thunderbolt port or HDMI port on the Mac.\nIf you just want the two monitors then you can plug a Mini DisplayPort to DVI cable into both the Thunderbolt ports or run one monitor DVI and the other via HDMI (leaving a Thunderbolt port free).\n", "Q: Unable to install R-2.11.1.pkg and up to R-3.0.2 in Mac OSX 10.8.5 I have an iMac 2013 with a Fusion Drive and OSX 10.8.5.

I really prefer to not to have to rebuild from source.\nI have had no issues installing R on my notebook with Lion.\n\nA: Why are you using the -store option? You realise that if you have that then -allowUntrusted is ignored. To quote the man page In this mode, no other options are supported. That option is there to check that a package is ready to be submitted to Apple for the App Store.\nTake that out. \nI also discovered that failed attempts seem to leave orphan installer processes running that seem to cause trouble in later attempts - even a kill -9 leaves them on the process stack.\nReboot your computer and then run Terminal.

I didn't update to iOS 6 because I didn't want Apple Maps and have my VLC app deleted. Now since the majority of the apps don't get any updates I thought of updating to iOS 6 (thanks to Google releasing the maps as stand-alone), but that(thanks to Apple offering update to only iOS 7 and nothing in between) is not possible anymore.\nMy question is - is it worth it, for iPad 2, to download the iOS 7 update? The system now(5.1.1) is still very smooth, the only thing I miss are some updates to few apps and an update for the WebKit(browsers are constantly crashing when some websites have really rich JavaScript features...).\n\nA: Have a read of this article , which conducts an analysis of iOS 7 on iPad 2, and see what you think. As noted in the link, enabling bold text will make a difference in iOS 7 on a non-retina display.\n\nA: Unfortunately you're too late indeed to get iOS 6 on your iPad 2 since Apple doesn't support downgrading iOS7 to iOS6 anymore. This was possible when iOS7 came out, and that's why I'm pointing it out here.\nAs tried myself, I've updated an iPad 2 to iOS7 but decided to downgrade it to iOS6 as everything started to work slower - iOS7 on an iPhone 4 doesn't work very well either.\nI'm glad it's back to iOS6, unfortunately for you there is nothing you can do now about it. If you jailbreak your device, you could upgrade it and downgrade with SHSH-blobs if you're not satisfied.

Your printer is supported by the Gutenprint open source printer drivers. \nhttp://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.php\nInstall these and you should be OK. You may find not all functions of the printer are supported but usually with Gutenprint they come close.\n\nA: The OS X Printer driver framework was heavily overhauled around the time of 10.6 so, to be frank, there's not a hope in hell that it'll work. You'll need to replace your printer with something newer.\n\nA: Unless you have a Macbook which you can set back to 10.3 there's no way you can use it anymore. \nOld printers are a pain for new software, as they will always remain slower than the applications (in the future) will ever be.\nSorry but no, you have either have a 2nd machine which you can set back to 10.3 or you have to get a newer printer.\n", "Q: how to remove full my GMail \"archive\" for Apple Mail?

Model is about 2 years old.\nI thought I had found it for the native window pane splitting within iterm splitting with the settings below, changing Working Directory from Home directory to Reuse previous session's directory:\n\nbut it didn't work, I'm still getting my home directory in new panes for Iterm window panes.\n[Update - I've found that the original tmux key combo's for this - actionKey + \" and actionKey plus % (no wonder I've remapped them!) do actually work on my mac, i.e.\n\nSo it seems that my remapping of them in .tmux.conf with\nset -g prefix C-a # this just changes my prefix from ctrl-b to ctrl-a\nbind \\ split-window -h # Split panes horizontal\nbind - split-window -v # Split panes vertically\n\nisn't working (the remap of ctrl-a works but the binding of the other two keys for split panes doesn't), why might that be?\nMy entire .tmux.conf file is:\n$ cat .tmux.conf\nbind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \\; display \"Reloaded!\" # Reload with ctrl-r\nset -g prefix C-a # prefix from ctrl-b to ctrl-a\nunbind C-b # allow ctrl-b for other things\nset -sg escape-time 1 # quicker responses\nbind C-a send-prefix # Pass on ctrl-a for other apps\nset -g base-index 1 # Numbering of windows\nsetw -g pane-base-index 1 # Numbering of Panes\nbind \\ split-window -h # Split panes horizontal\nbind - split-window -v # Split panes vertically\n\nI've also tried removing my .vimrc file though it shouldn't have been relevant to the terminal shell issue but I did it anyway and it didn't helped.\nInfo Update: \n$ tmux -V\ntmux 1.8\n[mdurrant@Macintosh ~]\n$ tmux list-keys | grep split\nbind-key          \" split-window\nbind-key          % split-window -h\n\np.s. I've updated the title to reflect my updates.\n\nA: I needed to reload (perhaps 'apply' is more appropriate) my configuration file.\nI had restarted my mac and thought this would have done it but I still needed to do:\n$ tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf\n\nNote: type this exactly as shown.  source-file is literally what you type (or copy-paste) it is NOT something you replace with your own value).\n", "Q: Extending a Time Capsule network with an AirPort Express connected by ethernet cable? I'd like to extend my home wireless network to a location that is too far away for wireless to reach. My plan was to do this by running a 100m/328' length of Cat6a cable from my Time Capsule to an AirPort Express located in the remote location.\nI thought I could just plug the ethernet in to the second port of the Time Capsule and then run that in to the AirPort Express, but it's not quite working. I'm missing some necessary part of the setup.\nHow can I get this working?\n\nA: You're on the the right path.\nBefore I give you the complete answer I just wanted to point out that you're running Cat6a at the very limit of it's length. It's rated for 100m/330ft and your run seems to be exactly that length. It's never good to be at the limits of connections, so bear that in mind when testing. You might want to test it with a short cable run, say 20m or so, if it's not working with the long cable run just to make sure your problems aren't because of the physical limits of the Cat6a cable. Try it with a run of cable long enough to get your AirPort Express just out of the range of the Time Capsule network.\nThat being said, this Apple discussion board article talks about how you have to set up the AirPort Express to act as a wireless network extender when it's connected via Ethernet to your Time Capsule.\nLet's make sure you have the connections set properly. You already know to use one of the LAN ports on the Time Capsule, but make sure you're plugging the cable in to the Ethernet WAN port on the AirPort Express. If you're looking at the back of the AirPort Express, it's the Ethernet port on the left, the one with the ring of dots around it. The port on the right can be used at your remote location to provide a non-wireless connection for a device like a printer, computer or switch (giving you even more wired connections at the remote location).\n\nWith the connections made, you want to configure the AirPort express to operate in bridge mode so it extends the network being provided by the Time Capsule instead of creating an entirely new network of its own.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fire up the AirPort Utility on your Mac or iOS device and connect to your AirPort Express\n\n*Use the Base Station section of the AirPort Utility to set up a name for the AirPort Express and that it's configured with password and what not;\n\n*Under the Wireless section of the AirPort Utility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new wireless network\n\n*Give the network the same name as the network being provided by your Time Capsule\n\n*Make sure \"Allow this network to be extended\" is unchecked\n\n*Set the radio mode for the AirPort Express to 802.11 n (b/g compatible)\n\n*Set the channel for the network to Automatic\n\n*For the wireless security and password set them to the exact same thing Time Capsule's network\n\n\n*Under the Internet Connection section of the AirPort Utility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the connection using to Ethernet\n\n*Set connection sharing to Off (Bridge Mode)\nSave all those changes and restart the AirPort Express by powering it off and then back on. You should now be able to deploy your AirPort Express out of the range of your Time Capsule's wireless network and, when you move between the two zones, any devices that use the wireless network will automatically switch to whichever devices is providing the stronger signal.\n", "Q: How to stop Setup Assistant from showing up on every restart on Mac Mini with OS X Mavericks? My Mac Mini is new.\nI'm not sure if this issue was already there before installing Server.app.\nUnsusual things happen with the system on EVERY RESTART: Messages Agent ask permission to use keychain to which I say \"always allow\" and it pops up again till I say only \"allow\"; Dock gets resete (all customization lost); it always notifies me that I can download iwork for free but I already did; it always asks for icloud password. It´s like it resets some stuff every startup. \n\nA: If Setup Assistant is running then the boot process almost certainly found no copy of  /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nTry sudo touch /var/db/.AppleSetupDone in Terminal then reboot.\nIf you are having trouble after that with strange parts of the install process staying around then you may have some widespread permission problems. Use Disk Utility to verify and then fix permissions on the volume and see how much that will fix after another reboot. You may find the problems still there on the first reboot after fixing them - it's the second that will tell.\nI doubt if the Server app is causing anything as it really is just an application that provides a GUI for setting up some stuff already on your Mac.\n\nA: I recently had this issue after having installed Mavericks, then used migration assistant to transfer my data from a HDD to an SSD. I followed every guide I could find, and none of the fixes worked for me.\nEventually I found a file in ~/Library/Preferences named com.apple.SetupAssistant.plist. In this file, I changed ShowKeychainSyncBuddyAtLogin to NO, RunNonInteractive and DidSeeCloudSetup to YES. This stopped the setup assistant from running for me, but now my dock won't save the fact that I don't want iBooks or Maps. I believe it is because of the RunNonInteractive flag, but am uncertain (and can't currently verify, as I'm making an image of my old HDD).\n\nA: system Preferences> click on bluetooth icon>click on advance tap on bottom >uncheck top two selections\n", "Q: Finder open new Finder tab in the same directory Is it possible to configure finder in Mavericks to open new tab (by clicking plus sign or cmd+t) in the same directory by default?\n\nA: Another similar approach to the one described by Lizzan but which doesn't need the path bar to be visible is to Cmd-click on the current folder in the title bar of your Finder window. This drops down a list of the hierarchical path to the current folder - so the 2nd entry in the list (after the current folder itself) is the parent of the current folder. If you cmd-click on the parent folder it will open in a new tab. To minimise the clicks required if you cmd-click and hold the cmd-click down then when you release it on the parent folder it will open in a new tab.\nThis approach is very useful if the folder you want in the new tab is actually a sibling of the current folder in the path hierarchy.\n\nA: Press cmd + ctrl + o in Finder without any selection (otherwise you will open-tab to the selection if it's a folder instead).\ncmd + ctrl + o will open a new tab in the same folder as the currently opened folder.\nNo need for any extra things in OS X for this ;-)\n\nA: There is another way to accomplish opening a new tab in the same location, if you don't absolutely need to have it as standard. \nOpen a Finder window and make sure that the Path bar is shown either by going to View -> Show Path Bar or by pressing ⌥⌘P. You then get the folder hierarchy in a bar at the bottom of the window. Just hold  ⌘ and double click any item in that bar to open that folder in a new tab (or new window if not using tabs).\n\n\nA: It's possible to create a automator action and turn it to a service, which you can assign a keyboard shortcut too.\nOpen automator > select create new service > where it says \"service receives selected\" choose [files or folder] > where it says \"in\" choose [Finder.app]\nThen find the automator action \"reveal finder items\" and drag it in. That's it. Save it as a service and then go to keyboard prefs and assign it something like ⌃⌘O. Now when you have a folder selected in finder and do that shortcut it will open a new tap to that location.\nIt's not perfect. I think I like the Command click title and then command click folder technique better but I thought I'd put it out there.\n\nPlease write to apple in their feedback page requesting an official finder preference for \"new Finder tabs show:\" [last opened directory] or [current directory] Maybe they will include in 10.10.\n\nA: In Monterey and later versions of MacOS:\npress the Command key while you double-click the folder.\nThe folder opens in a new tab or window, depending on your Finder preferences.\n\nA: No, there's no option to do this. The new tab uses the following setting from Finder preferences. There's no option to use the current location or a different location for tabs.\n\n\nA: There's a Finder add-on/replacement called TotalFinder, which has (among other finder tweaks) an option to open new tabs with the location of the last active tab/window.\nIt's commercial software ($18USD at the time of writing) so probably only worth it if you also want its other features & tweaks.\n\nA: Add this to complex modifications in Karabiner. Basically it will simulate go up once, go down once, then cmd + ctrl + o. The first two to make sure nothing is selected.\nIt is a bit slow though.\nIf you have a better idea of how to simulate the unselecting of anything then let me know. Maybe up will not work on /.\n    \"description\": \"momomo.com.karabiner.finder.new.tab.in.same.location\",\n        \"manipulators\": [\n                {\n        \n                        \"conditions\": [\n                                {\n                                        \"bundle_identifiers\": [\n                                                \"^com.apple.finder\"\n                                        ],\n                                        \"type\": \"frontmost_application_if\"\n                                }\n                        ],\n                        \n                        \"from\": {\n                                \"key_code\": \"t\",\n                                \"modifiers\": {\n                                        \"mandatory\": [\n                                                \"left_command\"\n                                        ]\n                                }\n                        },\n                        \"to\": [\n                                {\n                                        \"key_code\": \"up_arrow\",\n                                        \"modifiers\": [\n                                                \"left_command\"\n                                        ]\n                                },\n                                {\n                                        \"key_code\": \"down_arrow\",\n                                        \"modifiers\": [\n                                                \"left_command\"\n                                        ]\n                                },\n                                {\n                                        \"key_code\": \"o\",\n                                        \"modifiers\": [\n                                                \"left_command\",\n                                                \"left_control\"\n                                                \n                                        ]\n                                }\n                        ],\n                        \"type\": \"basic\"\n                }\n        ]\n}\n\nUpdated version, better, faster:\n\"description\": \"momomo.com.karabiner.finder.new.tab.in.same.location\",\n\"manipulators\": [\n    {\n        \"conditions\": [\n            {\n                \"bundle_identifiers\": [\n                    \"^com.apple.finder\",\n                    \"^com.cocoatech.PathFinder\"\n                ],\n                \"type\": \"frontmost_application_if\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"from\": {\n            \"key_code\": \"t\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n                \"mandatory\": [\n                    \"left_command\"\n                ]\n            }\n        },\n        \"to\": [\n            {\n                \"key_code\": \"a\",\n                \"modifiers\": [\n                    \"left_command\",\n                    \"left_option\"\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"key_code\": \"o\",\n                \"modifiers\": [\n                    \"left_command\",\n                    \"left_control\"\n                ]\n            }\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"basic\"\n    }\n]\n\nIn Monterey the above no longer works, and this is an updated but with some quirks:\n[\n  {\n    \"conditions\": [\n      {\n        \"bundle_identifiers\": [\n          \"^com.apple.finder\",\n          \"^com.cocoatech.PathFinder\"\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"frontmost_application_if\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \n    \"from\": {\n      \"key_code\": \"t\",\n      \"modifiers\": {\n        \"mandatory\": [\n          \"left_command\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \n    \"to\": [\n      {\n        \"key_code\": \"up_arrow\",\n        \"modifiers\": [\n          \"left_command\",\n          \"left_control\"\n        ]                                        \n      }\n    ],\n\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"basic.to_delayed_action_delay_milliseconds\": 275\n    },\n\n    \"to_delayed_action\": {\n      \"to_if_invoked\": [\n        {\n          \"key_code\": \"o\",\n          \"modifiers\": [\n            \"left_command\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n                                                                \n    \"type\": \"basic\"\n  }\n  \n]\n\nNote that for monterey, you need to COMMAND + T, and then release only T, holding down command for command + o to work.

Logitech claims that one may program the uses of the two buttons for personal use.\nNow, I am using it together with my MBPR late 2013, and the two buttons do not work any more. Is it possible to program it so that one button is still for displaying the desktop, and the other open the Application Center?\n\nA: Mac-compatible Logitech mouses come with a preference pane to program their features.  Or (even if not Mac-compatible) try a third-party mouse-button utility, like SteerMouse, $20.\nedit\nHere is the post about using the Logitech M325 on Mac.  Maybe that will work in other cases, too.\n\nA: It can be worked around by using ControllerMate. The left and right tilt are mouse button 4 & 5 respectively, and the first side button is a command key. So just re-map these button to whatever you want.\nFor example, if I want the first side button to show desktop, I just need to map it to F11. Also, if I want to map the left and right tilt to scroll horizontally, I just map them to horizontal scroll wheel with repeaters attached. My setting is show below.\nNote that ControllerMate is free to use if the number of settings you defined is less then 10.

I've already tried serveradmin stop X for the Xcode and calendar services, and although I can stop and start them that way, those few stray services still stay running.\nAlso, a bonus question: where is the manpage or help document for serverctl?\nDisabled and enabled services shown here:\n$ sudo serverctl list\n{\n    disabledServices =     (\n        \"com.apple.AccountsConfigService\",\n        \"com.apple.afctl\",\n        \"com.apple.AssetCache\",\n        \"com.apple.collabd.expire\",\n        \"com.apple.collabd.notifications\",\n        \"com.apple.collabd.preview\",\n        \"com.apple.collabd.quicklook\",\n        \"com.apple.collabd.scm_poller\",\n        \"com.apple.collabd.stats\",\n        \"com.apple.DeviceManagement.dmrunnerd\",\n        \"com.apple.DeviceManagement.php-fpm\",\n        \"com.apple.ftpserver\",\n        \"com.apple.list_server_mgr\",\n        \"com.apple.mail_exclusion\",\n        \"com.apple.mail_status_init\",\n        \"com.apple.mail_status_periodic\",\n        \"com.apple.ppp.l2tp\",\n        \"com.apple.ppp.pptp\",\n        \"com.apple.push_notify\",\n        \"com.apple.Rooms\",\n        \"com.apple.salearn\",\n        \"com.apple.saupdate\",\n        \"com.apple.server.filesharing\",\n        \"com.apple.server.mail.alerts\",\n        \"com.apple.server.netboot\",\n        \"com.apple.server.opendirectory\",\n        \"com.apple.swupdate.host\",\n        \"com.apple.swupdate.sync\",\n        \"com.apple.xcs.stats\",\n        \"com.apple.xcsbuildd\",\n        \"com.apple.xcscgsessiond\",\n        \"org.amavis.amavisd\",\n        \"org.amavis.amavisd_cleanup\",\n        \"org.calendarserver.calendarserver\",\n        \"org.clamav.clamd\",\n        \"org.clamav.freshclam-init\",\n        \"org.clamav.freshclam\",\n        \"org.dovecot.dovecotd\",\n        \"org.dovecot.fts.update\",\n        \"org.freeradius.radiusd\",\n        \"org.isc.named\",\n        \"org.jabber.jabberd\",\n        \"org.jabber.proxy65\",\n        \"org.postgresql.postgres\"\n    );\n    enabledServices =     (\n        \"com.apple.apspd\",\n        \"com.apple.collabd\",\n        \"com.apple.DeviceManagement.devicemgrd\",\n        \"com.apple.DeviceManagement.postgres\",\n        \"com.apple.DeviceManagement.SCEPHelper\",\n        \"com.apple.opendirectorybackup\",\n        \"com.apple.server.alertsd\",\n        \"com.apple.server.eventsd\",\n        \"com.apple.server.v2.stats\",\n        \"com.apple.ServerEventAgent\",\n        \"com.apple.servermgr_xcode.get_currently_connected_devices\",\n        \"com.apple.servermgr_xcode.sync_adc\",\n        \"com.apple.servermgrd\",\n        \"com.apple.disks.smart.status\",\n        \"com.apple.xcscredd\",\n        \"com.apple.xcscredhandler\",\n        \"com.apple.xcsdevicesnifferd\",\n        \"com.apple.xcsxcodeappwatcher\",\n        \"org.calendarserver.agent\",\n        \"org.calendarserver.relocate\"\n    );\n}\n\n\nA: Your list of active services mirrors mine on a server with only DNS running per the server app:\nenabledServices =     (\n    \"com.apple.apspd\",\n    \"com.apple.collabd\",\n    \"com.apple.DeviceManagement.devicemgrd\",\n    \"com.apple.DeviceManagement.postgres\",\n    \"com.apple.DeviceManagement.SCEPHelper\",\n    \"com.apple.opendirectorybackup\",\n    \"com.apple.server.alertsd\",\n    \"com.apple.server.eventsd\",\n    \"com.apple.server.v2.stats\",\n    \"com.apple.ServerEventAgent\",\n    \"com.apple.servermgrd\",\n    \"com.apple.disks.smart.status\",\n    \"com.apple.xcscredd\",\n    \"com.apple.xcscredhandler\",\n    \"org.calendarserver.agent\",\n    \"org.calendarserver.relocate\",\n    \"org.isc.named\"\n);\n\nIn your case, the collabd should be running and it is complaining about the machine serial number. Check that your hardware serial number is in fact readable via software:\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'Serial'\n\nThe best way to troubleshoot server when you don't trust the graphical server app (or want more details) is to use serveradmin command as opposed to the serverctl command. As you have noticed, serverctl is undocumented, so you'll want to stick with the stable serveradmin interface if at all possible.\nHere's a short loop command that dumps just the running/stopped status of the various subsystems that serveradmin knows about:\nfor service in `sudo serveradmin list`\ndo\n  sudo serveradmin status $service | egrep \"RUNNING|STOPPED\"\ndone\n\nYou could easily change that grep command to stop only the running services...\nsudo serveradmin status $service | grep \"RUNNING\" && sudo serveradmin stop $service\n\n\nA: I see the same thing on my server, which is what brought me here. I'm sorry I cannot help much, but to point to this thread with the serverctl command, e.g.\nsudo serverctl disable service=com.apple.collabd.notifications\n\n\nA: There are a small number of daemons that are required for remote and local administration.\nThere are also an even smaller number of processes that are so tied into the OS that is easier to leave them running than to turn them off.\nWhich of the three possibilities any given daemon falls into is almost impossible to know. The thread pointed to in another answer does give you a list of processes that can be safely unloaded by launchctl to go even further back to nothing than either the Server app or serveradmin command line tool. Awhile ago I tested and they are fine to unload.\nThe better question is why you are getting thousands of errors a minute written to the log. There must be something wrong with your setup as my server does nothing of the sort.\nLet's see if we can fix that problem.\nHave you tried to set this server up as an Open Directory master yet? I only ask as getting that working means that a number of certificate, DNS and host table issues have to be 100% for an OD master to come up and by the look of that log output there may be a problem with the security on the server being over zealously broken. My other question, in the log you have given does it literally say 'domain.com' or does it give your domain and you changed it for security reasons?\n", "Q: Upgrading MacBook Pro 17\" - do I need to connect old drive externally?

Long story short, my wife's photos sync to her computer, mine only syncs to 1 of 3 computers (all Win 7 Pro) all on the same wifi network at home. As mentioned, no problems on 1 of our computers with the photos populating within seconds of taking them. On the 2 that will not show them, I can only get iCloud to show \"My Photo Stream\" and \"Activity\" folders when clicking the \"iCloud Photos\" shortcut link in favorites when opening Windows Explorer\n\nOn the computer that does bring the photo from the cloud, I set it up to save them to a network drive and if I point the non-working pc's to that folder as default for iCloud, I still see nothing on my computer when double clicking \"My Photo Stream\"\n\nHere's the kicker: if I click the \"Open Folder\" link in the above photo, the folder opens correctly and shows the files\n\nDoes anyone have any clues why these photos in the linked default iCloud folder are not showing on 2 of my computers? I've tried for many hours to figure this out and would appreciate any suggestions beyond the normal \"reset iCloud\" - \"sign out then sign back in\" - \"delete account from phone and reload it\" answers. \n\nA: This is genuinely because of multiple iCloud accounts used on one PC. Just for the sake of experiment, try installing iCloud on a PC where no other iCloud have ever been installed. I am sure, it will sync with it, and it is certainly a cache problem. \nSecondly, regarding the My Photo Stream not showing up anything but you can still see 3 photos when you click open folder ... this is because Photo Stream shows photos when its a collection or multiple of 5 photos (e.g 5, 10, 15, 20), so if you have 5 photos in the folder, it will show up, then it won't show until it get 10 (in case of total photos <> multiple of 5, it will come up with all photos it has, as the last photo will tell that this is the end of the album). Make sure it is not a network drive, as iCloud doesn't re-download photos once it is interrupted. \n", "Q: How do I install Darwin 13 on OS X 10.9.1?

Every time I access Alfred, I get this dialog box, \"Alfred would like to access your contacts.\" I always have to click \"OK\" before I can use the program. I have verified that the Alfred checkbox is checked in the Contacts settings in System Preferences. Does anyone have any other ideas?\n\n\nA: Just like @nobody-in-particular said, your Alfred code was probably changed, therefore the signature that was in place for Alfred is no longer valid. What you have to do is sign the application after the changes to the code.\nThis worked for me:\nsudo codesign --force --deep --sign - \"/Applications/Alfred 2.app/Contents/Frameworks/Alfred Framework.framework/Versions/A/Alfred Framework\"\n\n\nA: Are you running Alfred version 2.1.1?\nIf you open Alfred Preferences and check the Features pane you can click on Contacts and try toggling ‘Open Contacts in Alfred’. \nYou might also try checking the Workflows pane and see if you have any workflows using Contacts.\n\nA: Is your copy of Alfred properly licensed, or pirated?  I'll admit that mine was pirated, and the newest cracked version kept asking for contacts, presumably because the code signing required for the Mac Store also applies to contact permissions.  If the code is changed (which it is in the cracking process) Apple's contact permissions API will need to continually ask for permission, since it doesn't recognize the program.  You might try Quicksilver instead; it's like Alfred but free and does more, although it's also more complicated and less shiny.\n\nA: Try running these commands in Terminal:\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\nsqlite> INSERT or REPLACE INTO access values ('kTCCServiceAddressBook','com.runningwithcrayons.Alfred-2', 0, 1, 0, NULL);\nsqlite> .exit\n\n\nA: You might want to look into Privacy Services Manager coming out of the University of Utah: https://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/privacy_services_manager\nOnce you're set up, Terminal command: privacy_services_manager.py add contacts /Applications/Chess.app\n", "Q: Broken laptop key attachmment Is there a universal laptop key support.

I saw things backedup; I saw firmware and software updated, and I saw things restored from backup. When the update was finished, I got the \"swipe to set up\" screen. It wanted to know what WiFi network I wanted to use, and it did not remember the password for that network. After reentering the password, it asked me to set up my Locations preferences. Then it asked me to do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*set up as new iPhone\n\n*restore from the cloud\n\n*restore from iTunes\nSince I had backed up to iTunes prior to updating, I chose option 3. Although my iPhone was connected to iTunes, it asked me to connect to iTunes. I ejected the phone from iTunes (which sees the phone as it always did), and unplugged/replugged it. It said connected to iTunes for a while, and then went back to saying Connect to iTunes.\nI cannot get past this point.\nMy worry is that the backup performed in ios 4 is not good enough for ios 7 and if I set up as a new phone and restore from my backup it will go back into the same loop.\nI would really like to get my phone working soon.\n\nA: I went to the Apple Store the next morning, and the person went into the \"Set up as new iPhone\" option and found a \"Skip\" option that I had not seen. This bypassed the whole set up process.\nAll of my data except some passwords and bluetooth pairings seem to have been preserved.\nSuggestion: There should be a fourth option, something like \"Use existing data\". The three options presented, along with the failure to go further, certainly made it look as if I had lost all of my data. Why would one choose \"Set up as new iPhone\" if one had data they wanted preserved?\n", "Q: Show table of contents when opening PDF in Preview Is there any way I can force Preview to always show the table of contents when opening a PDF? Most of the PDFs I use have a ToC, so this would save me the extra step from having to enable the ToC after opening the PDF.\n\nA: This is currently not possible to be set as default in Preview. The closest you can get to this is Preferences → Opening for the first time: Always show sidebar. However, the sidebar that opens is the default thumbnail view, not the TOC.\n\nYou can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n", "Q: Attempting to update app asks for a different iTunes account password I am trying to update WhatsApp. It is asking me for an iTunes password of a different email address and I can't change it.\nI rebooted my phone, signed in and out of iTunes and it is not changing it.\nWhat should I do?\nWill I lose the existing conversations if I change the Apple ID following the instructions in the answer provided (I.e. Deleting whatsapp in the old ID and downloading it with the new Apple ID? Or is the conversation linked to the phone number, not the app? \n\nA: The Apple ID being requested will be the Apple ID that was used to purchase the app originally. It can't be changed, since it is linked to the specific app. If you wish to use your Apple ID instead, you can delete the app from the device and re-purchase it in the App Store using the correct Apple ID.\n", "Q: Can Spotlight be configured to search ALL files on the hard drive (or is there a powerful alternative) - like Windows' Start Menu search can be? On Windows - since Vista onwards - I'm used to an extremely powerfully configurable instant file/folder/setting search feature: namely its instant indexed Start Menu search. Having a powerful computer, I add every single file and folder to the index so that any little file or folder I'm after (including both file name and extension), is immediately, instantly searchable right from the Start Menu.\nIt looks like Spotlight is OS X's equivalent of this.\nIs there a way I can achieve the same thing, to index every single file on the hard drive, in OS X? So far I see no in-built way to add custom/system folders (or indeed all folders) on the Mac outside the ones it offers, like on this screenshot:\n\nIf there's no in-built solution such as a set of Terminal instructions, is there a good third party solution for this? (As always, free options are more desirable than paid.)\n\nA: I can recommend EasyFind and Find Any File (of which I'm the author, incidentally). Both search for file names on entire disks.\nThey search even in places where Spotlight never looks (e.g. in the System and Library folders).\nIn case of Find Any File, you can even easily search as root user, so that it even finds files usually not accessible to you. FAF also lets you save a set of preferred paths, either as a default or as a \"search\" document that you can open as a pre-configured search configuration.\n\nA: Unfortunately, no, you can't add custom paths to Spotlight.\nI use and recommend Alfred, which lets you set a custom Search Scope:\n\nYou can search normally just by typing, or press space (which inserts a ' — the operator for a File Search) then type to search all paths:\n\n", "Q: iCloud for Automator and services Since Mavericks, Automator is now able to store services (.workflow) in iCloud.\nThe problem is that services are not available in the Services menu or contextual menu (right-click) when I store them that way.\nAm I missing something? I don't see the point of iCloud for Automator if I have to duplicate the services to ~/Library/Services in order to use them.\n\nA: You can save services anywhere, not just iCloud or the correct Service location. Because of this, I used to save services in my Dropbox and symlink them on multiple Macs. With the advent of iCloud, I use this instead, saving my services in iCloud then symlinking them on multiple machines.\nAlso, iCloud in Automator is not just for services — it'll sync all the Automator files, including workflows and applications.\n\nA: This is how I think it works. When you have Automator services, workflows etc. On Mac1,\nOpen the service in Automator and click File > Export. In the 'Where' field, choose 'Automator - iCloud' and hit Save. If this is your first time, you will see a new folder under iCloud Drive called 'Automator'.\nThere are a couple of ways to \"Import\" to Mac2 based on it you know where your Services folder is located:\n\n*\n\n*You don't know: Open Automator, click File > Duplicate. On the new 'Untitled' window, click File > Save and give it a name. It should save to the appropriate Services folder.\n\n*You know: Simply Open iCloud Drive, folder 'Automator' and drag the file to your Services folder.\n\nIs this iCloud feature just a mitigation for not knowing location of the Services folder? Beats me!\n\nA: I created an alias to the Services folder in iCloud Drive so I can simply duplicate and drag the Automator file. It's not the most elegant solution but the best I came up with.\n\nA: \nAm I missing something? I don't see the point of iCloud for Automator if I have to duplicate the services to ~/Library/Services in order to use them.\n\nUnfortunately, this still seems to be the case as of this posting. \nI, too, have elected to use symlinks as a workaround. In the spirit of automation, I have a Folder Action monitoring the iCloud Automator directory ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Automator/Documents\nThe action simply consists of one 'Run Shell Script' action, running /bin/bash passing input as arguments:\n# Remove all existing symlinks in ~/Library/Services\nfind \"$HOME/Library/Services\" -maxdepth 1 -type l -delete\n\n# For each item currently in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Automator/Documents\nallservices=(\"$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Automator/Documents/\"*)\nfor f in \"${allservices[@]}\"; do\n  # Basename of item\n  bf=$(basename \"$f\")\n\n  # Exclude all .hidden files and other exclusions\n  if ! [[ $bf =~ ^\\..*$|^Disabled$|^Workflows$ ]]; then\n    # Add symlink to ~/Library/Services\n    ln -s \"$f\" \"$HOME/Library/Services/$bf\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nAdmittedly a quick-n-dirty solution (non-production code), I make no promises for file names with obscure characters. The Folder Action is not triggered when a file is deleted, so whenever a file is added to the iCloud Automator directory, or when a file is renamed, the script simply clears and rebuilds the symlinks in the Services directory. That way any deleted service would eventually be properly mirrored as soon as the next service is added or renamed.\nI know it's a few years too late, but I just found this thread searching for the same functionality.\n", "Q: VMware Fusion 6: cannot start Windows 2000 VM that worked in VMware Fusion 4 Got this message when starting a Windows 2000 VM on VMware Fusion 6 on a Retina MacBook Pro with OS X Mavericks:\n\nThis virtual machine's policies are too old to be run by this version of VMware Fusion.\n\nCould only find this Danish question with no answers.\nFusion 6 is supposed to \n\n\n*\n\n*run any old virtual hardware version (this one is virtual hardware 7, I think it originates from VMware Workstation 6.5).\n\n*support Windows 2000\nAnyone having the faintest idea how to start digging for a cause?\n\n\nEdit: extra information about the settings, .vmx and .vmxf files.\nOpening the settings for this VM gets the same message.\nVMware Virtual Hardware version overview.\nThere are a few lines with the word policy in the .vmx file, but none in the .vmfx file.

Mainly they came with an iPhone 2 / 3 and asked for help because their Macs won't recognize them. Some (not all devices!) worked on an older Mac with OSX < 10.7 and a lower iTunes version. If you have a friend or family member with an older Mac try to connect to this one.\nIf it's not working I would say the iPad is \"bricked\".\n\nA: First, you should never reset all content and settings on a jailbroken device (trust me. I did it before. I had to restore it). All it will accomplish is get your device in trouble.\nSo, what jailbreak did you use? Try restoring it to stock 5.1.1 firmware and see what happens. Then jailbreak it with redsn0w if everything is OK. Follow the tutorial here: http://www.iphonehacks.com/2012/06/jailbreak-ios-5-1-1-new-ipad-3-ipad-2-ipad-1-users-redsn0w-untethered.html\nIf that turns out OK, then slowly install your tweaks, one by one.\n\nA: Have you tried your iPad in another computer - maybe friends PC/Mac? Don't sync as this can erase your iPad, but it would show if the other machine can see your iPad. This would then help you understand if the problem lies with the iPad or your Mac. Good luck!\n\nA: Taken from this Apple Support Article : http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1591\nFollow these steps to resolve your issue:\nEnsure that your Mac meets the minimum system requirements for your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\nInstall software updates on your Mac.\nNote: If an iTunes update is available, apply the update.\nCheck USB connections. iOS devices require USB 2.0 to function properly. If you're not sure your Mac has USB 2.0 ports, refer to the computer's specifications.\nDisconnect other USB devices and connect your device directly to a USB port on your Mac.\nRestart your Mac.\n", "Q: MacBook will read USB drives with no problem, but will not see the USB drive as boot drive I am trying to install OS X Lion on a Macbook 4,1 which I've upgraded to 4 GB of RAM.\nIt should support this OS, however I cannot get my Mac to see the USB drive as a bootable option. It's a SANDISK Data traveler 16GB\nSo far I've tried \n\n\n*\n\n*Flashing the drive initially to Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\n\n*Partion the drive as GUID\n\n*Restoring the install DMG which should according to most guides make the drive bootable\n\n\nHowever even though the drive mounts in my OS (10.5.8) it won't show in the startup disks as a bootable option.\nI've tried using two permissions reset programs, another USB stick and even reseting the NVRAM. But still no joy. Does anyone know of anything else it could be?\n\nA: Try resetting the PRAM settings. First, restart your Mac, and before you hear the \"bing\" sound press option key (alt) + command + r + p, it will restart your Mac, after you hear the sound twice just plug in your USB stick and press the option button and boot from there. It worked for me. Hope this helped you out.\n\nA: Have you \"blessed\" the drive?\nIn the terminal try\nsudo bless --folder /Volumes/<drivename>/System/Library/CoreServices\n\n(replacing  with the name of your drive) It should now appear in the list of bootable drives.\nIf that doesn't work try setting it as the boot device by hand and see what happens.\nsudo bless --mount /Volumes/<drivename> --setBoot --nextonly\n\nThen your Mac will attempt to boot off the drive on the next reboot.\n", "Q: Finder Instantly Crashing Finder crashes as soon as I open it, In addition to this, when I plugged my iPod into my Mac, that started crashing too and now doesn't boot. \nCrash logs:\nhttp://pastebin.com/TCa9CaC3\n\nA: Rebooting fixes the finder crash. The iOS crash must be a separate issue\n", "Q: Epson Stylus Color Photo R200 won't print I have a Mac Mini (late 2012) with Mavericks installed. It is connected via USB to an Epson Stylus Color Photo R200 inkjet printer. \nWhen I print, the print job window says\nStopped - Unsupported colorspace = -1, 2 pages\n\nI have run Software Update.  This is the first time I have tried to use the printer, normally it connects to my old PC and works fine.\n\nA: A new print driver for this printer was made available for Mavericks in September of '13. Have you downloaded and tried this new driver? I had to update the driver for a Epson Stylus Color Photo R300 for a client of mine to make it work on Mavericks.\n", "Q: Equivalent of airodump-ng for Max OS X Is there any equivalent of airodump-ng for Mac OS X (it only runs on linux), providing an overview of the current wireless traffic on nearby Access Points, i.e:\n\n\n*\n\n*number of captured data packets\n\n*list of devices currently associated with each AP\n\n\nA: After much frustration with this same problem I found a way to actually use Airodump on my Mac terminal. What I realized is that all of the files that I can successfully execute are located in the directory path\n/usr/local/bin/ \nAnd it turns out that Airodump was actually on my computer, it was just stored in the path\n/usr/local/sbin\nAnd I was unable to execute it from that path. All I did was move Airodump from the /usr/local/sbin path to the /usr/local/bin path and it now works great! I was going crazy for hours and it was that simple \n\nA: You can easily install using homebrew\nDo brew install aircrack-ng\nThen do \nairodump-ng-oui-update to install or update airodump-ng\n\nA: It is possible to use Wireshark with monitor mode enabled to essentially do the job of airodump-ng. This will allow for capture of raw 802.11 frames which will show the traffic from APs and clients. It needs to be remembered that the WiFi device can only listen on one channel at a time so you'll only see the traffic on the channel it's set to. You can choose the channel by associating a desired network before the capture or using the using the airport (/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport) command (e.g. to sniff channel 1 given your WiFi adapter is called en0) :\nairport en0 sniff 1\n\nNote that command this will also capture packets to a file (it's name will be printed when the sniff command exits) so one can just use airport to capture and then open the file in Wireshark or just quit the airport command after you have started monitor mode capture and let Wireshark collect them so you can see them in realtime. One can actually change the capture channel whilst Wireshark is running but you may miss packets whilst the channel change occurs.\n\nA: As I don't have a running linix box at present I'm not up on the capabilities of aircrack-ng\nPossibles:  iStumbler at http:istumbler.net  Of the fairly sparse field,this one is probably the most current.\nKisMac is a older port of Kismet last released in 2006, but reported to work on Snow Leopard.  Haven't tried it.\nAnother possible useful tool is WireShark. You will need to install XQuartz to use it, as it's an X11 windows app.\nA final possibility is to install windows under VirtualBox, Parallels or VMFusion and give it full access to your ethernet cards.\n\nBased on the clarification in your comment, I think wireshark would do what you want if you want to look at traffic.    \nIf you just want to count packets, you can use netstat. This is a terminal program.\n(see man netstat)\n~/Webwork/sftf\n647 ==> netstat  -w10\n            input        (Total)           output\n   packets  errs      bytes    packets  errs      bytes colls\n        73     0      17551         77     0      11256     0\n        31     0       4731         41     0       6891     0\n\n-w10 gives you a record every 10 seconds.  If you wanted hourly records you'd use -w3600.\nNetstat is general purpose.  If you have multiple interfaces, you can filter to a given one with the -I flag.  You can also do some filtering by protocol, address family.\nIf you need serious filtering  (I want to know how many packets bitorrent sent to the pirate bay last week) then you need either wireshark or tcpdump. (Tcpdump is commandline)   Wireshark is basically a GUI on top of tcpdump.  Both have their place.  \n\nA: I found out that pyrit can achieve a similar result:\n\n\n*\n\n*Capture wireless traffic with tshark:\nsudo tshark -i en1 -I -w wlan.pcap\n\n\n*Analyze capture with pyrit:\npyrit -r wlan.pcap analyze\n\n\nA: You can install it using brew\n\nbrew install aircrack-ng\n\nOr using port\n\nsudo port install aircrack-ng\n\n\nA: I am using aircrack-ng on my mac, from the terminal, not emulating another OS. Here is a good page mentioning the relation to other tools, which I think may help you : http://easymactips.blogspot.com/2010/10/how-to-install-aircrack-on-mac.html\nBy the way, maybe you already have in the system what you are looking for: hidden in your airport is, from yosemite on, a sniffer. Press option and your wifi icon, you will see the option wireless diagnostics. Command 4 is scan (you see networks, channels, MACs, and other data) and command 6 is sniffer. Give that a try too. Best greetings. \n\nA: Since aircrac-ng lacks both airodump-ng and aireplay-ng[ref. their documentation] you should look into: KisMac2. An open source wireless stumbling and security tool for Mac OS X.\nAmong other things it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shows logged in clients\n\n*Can capture packets (PCAP export possible)\n\n*Reveals hidden SSIDs\n\n*Can perform various attacks like the \"deauthentication attack\"\n\n\nThey link the zipped .dmg file at the end of the README file: KisMac2.zip.\n\nA: airodump-ng (as aireplay-ng, airbase-ng, airserve-ng, airtun-ng, …) is located in /usr/local/sbin on a Mac.\nTherefore you can add this path to your $PATH env variable:\necho 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.profile\n\nWhen running a new session (opening a new terminal or running source ~..profile) you have access to airodump-ng command and all other aircrack related.\n\nA: Have you tried http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=install_aircrack\nIt has instructions to install aircrack-ng on Mac.\nFrom the website:\n\nInstalling on Mac OSX\nThe simplest and easiest way to install on Mac OS X is via Macports. You simply do “sudo >port install aircrack-ng”.\nAlternatively, use the following instructions:\nMake sure you have Xcode installed on your Mac, which can be found on the installer >CD/DVD which came with your Mac. After getting the source you can do a simple “make && >sudo make install” from the untarred directory. When you use the stable, you need to >rename the Makefile.osx to Makefile and when you use the dev version it will autodetect you are using Darwin and compile fine.\nMind you, airodump-ng and aireplay-ng are linux only and will not work under OSX native, so for reinjecting and sniffing you will have to use other means.\nIf you have an intel Mac check out the VMware Fusion option which is mentioned lower on >this page.\nOptional is openssl-dev and sqlite3 which can be installed through fink\n\n\nA: You might want to try KisMac2 :\nhttps://github.com/IGRSoft/KisMac2\n", "Q: Clock won't keep time after Mavericks installation My clock no longer keeps time properly after installation of Mavericks. This problem affects all of my iMacs immediately post-Mavericks, so it's not an issue with a bad battery.\nThe symptom is: The clock drifts by about a minute per day. Clicking the Date & Time applet in Settings immediately syncs the clock to the correct time. So the NTP servers are obviously working. It's just that Mavericks doesn't make use of them to set the system clock unless the Date & Time applet is clicked.\nI followed the advise here and used the UI to set multiple time servers. I used the recommended string: 0.us.pool.ntp.org, 1.us.pool.ntp.org, 2.us.pool.ntp.org, 3.us.pool.ntp.org\nAfter having made this change, instead of the clock losing thirty seconds per day, now it gains one minute per day.\nAs you can see from the log, it executes a few time syncs correctly and then just stops.

panic when the machine is attempting to do something to the power management, which would correspond with your report of fan noise before the crash.\nFirst step would be to reset the System Management Controller\nInstructions for doing that are in this Apple support note :-\nIntel-based Macs: Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC)\nThen try running Apple Hardware Test by rebooting with the D down - details are here :- http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509\nThen check to see if the hard drive will verify - a bad drive could have corrupted the System.\nIf that doesn't work I'd try running off a System on an external drive for a day or two to see if it is a corrupt system on a good hard drive.\n\nA: It seems that your GPU is dead or faulty.

I used Automator: choose \"Application\" for document type, then select \"Set Folder View\".  Name the app, then you can drop any number of folders on top of it and it will set the view options to whatever you've selected.\n\nA: The easiest way and fastest to generate .DS_Store files is to open a Finder window in that folder and going to Finder / View / Show View Options (shortcut Cmd+J) and deselecting Show icon preview. But you can also make this the default behaviour for folders without the stored preferences by clicking on Use as defaults.\nIf you have many folders to take care of (and the Use as defaults isn't enough for you), you could write a script (AppleScript) to go through each of them and do that programmatically.\n", "Q: How do I install GCC and make on a mac without administrator access or using Xcode? I'd like to install gcc and make on my Macbook Air, but I don't have root access on it. I found this link through searching on google, but I have no idea how to set up the prefix's so that the actual gcc executable can find the libraries. I have a directory set up with node.js and git installed at ~/usr/local and I'd like to install GCC there also. I have no idea where to start with make. Can anyone help? :D\n\nA: If you don't have administrator access to your machine, you are still be able to install pre-compiled binary software inside your home directories. Create a folder in your home directory called usr and a directory inside that one called bin, if you want to match the standard directory structure of where make and gcc usually reside.\nyou can find a gnu make binary for os x here\nabout make\nyou can find a download link for a gcc binary for os x here\nabout gcc\nUsing these tools successfullly without sudo (admin or root) access is altogether another thing... and you didn't ask about that, and I can't answer that, anyway. It seems like it would be easier to gain admin access through various methods available on the web than to try to build software without admin access. But this, of course, is not part of your question. Best of luck!\n(and FYI, I'm pretty sure Brew requires xcode, and if you can get xcode installed, brewnistas enthusiam for Brew notwithstanding, MacPorts is far far more resiliant and mature than Brew)\n\nA: The best way to install the gcc toolchain without using Apple's command line tools is to use Homebrew.\nAfter installing Homebrew then \nbrew tap homebrew/versions && brew install apple-gcc49\nbrew link --force apple-gcc49\nln -nsf $(which gcc-4.9) /usr/bin/gcc-4.9\n\nshould have you working.\nYou can find more details here:\nhttp://new-bamboo.co.uk/blog/2013/10/24/3-quick-tips-for-coding-with-os-x-10-9-mavericks\nNote that the gcc toolchain includes make.\n", "Q: Does installing Wireshark via homebrew provide a graphical interface? I installed wireshark using homebrew with the command brew install wireshark. Everything seems to install fine and I can use dumpcap to capture packets but now I want to view them. Using a text editor like vi doesn't format some of the output very well due to an abundance of unreadable characters. \nIt looks like there should be a Wireshark.app to view the trace files with, however, I do not see how to start it.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Type brew options wireshark to show the options provided with wireshark. \nTo install Wireshark with the UI : \nbrew install wireshark --with-qt\n\nIf you've already installed, you can use the reinstall command instead. This should only download the required qt dependencies.\nbrew reinstall wireshark --with-qt\n\n\nA: If you use the pre-built Wireshark binaries from http://www.wireshark.org/download.html you get the X11 GUI built in. It calls up X11 on its own (which can take a while to start and make it appear as if Wireshark is broken).\n\nA: The new approach is to use brew install wireshark --with-qt. \nThe --with-x option no longer works.\nMore details on the switch to QT: https://blog.wireshark.org/2013/10/switching-to-qt/\n", "Q: Mount NTFS on OS X I am having trouble mounting one of my NTFS drives in OS X.\nI've added the following entry to my fstab with the 'vifs' command.\nUUID=UUID_FROM_DISK_UTILITY /data ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse\n\nI have created the /data mountpoint with 'mkdir /data' and attempted to mount with 'mount -a'.\nI get the following error:\nmount_ntfs: UUID=UUID_FROM_DISK_UTILITY on /data: No such file or directory\n\nEdit: I can mount with the disk utility, but not from the terminal.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: http://sourceforge.net/projects/native-ntfs-osx/files/\nNative solution.

What to do in the iPhone itself, the associated Mac/iTunes and your account at Apple/iCloud.\n\nA: Settings > General > Erase > Erase all content and settings\nThat will wipe it to factory\n\nA: I would just restore it in iTunes. That would wipe it of all data and reset it back to factory settings.\n\nA: Regarding step 6 in the article you linked:\nThere is a difference between destroying the encryption key and writing over the data on your iPhone with new data a la \"Secure Empty Trash\" in Mac OS X. As far as I was able to find (searching a lot on the net), iOS 2.0 + on original and 3G, data was actually securely erased by writing over it. iPhone 3GS and later simply drop the encryption key and make a new one when you \"Erase\" from within settings. This is a 256 bit (AES i think) key, so recreating it would be challenging, though not impossible (for someone with time/resources, i.e. government agency).\nI recently listed an old iphone for sale.\n(In addition to unregistering it with all services, find phone, imessage, apple support, any other third party accounts you have connected to it, etc.):\nIf/when it sells I plan to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n**Reset iPhone in Settings as detailed by MisterMike\n\n**sync with iTunes and have it \"Automatically fill free space with music.\"\n\n*repeat both above steps 1 & 2 at least twice more (arbitrary number, not sure if more times helps or makes no difference with the type of NAND memory in my hardware version, or any other).\n\n**Do a factory firmware restore on the iphone.\n\n*repeat step 3\n\n*repeat step 1\n\n*repeat step 4\n\n*congratulate myself on massive redundancy.\n\n\nNote: if you just want to ensure the data is written over once, just do steps 1,2, and 4.\n\nA: Before you sell your old iphone you need to make sure that your data is safe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take A Backup of your iPhone\n\n*Delete Apps\n\n*Delete Photos\n\n*Delete iCloud Accounts.\n\n*Erase Contents from notes.\n\n\nClear everything from you iPhone erase settings, too. \nAlso have a look at 10 things to do Before you sell your old iPhone.\n", "Q: Unable to start computer after using sudo crontab -e I've set it so that my Mac will forcefully shutdown at 12:00 everyday.

I am currently switching over from Linux to OS X, and in the process have found a few surprising differences between the two systems. \nI am quite used to the concept of installing most applications into my user's home directory, as a general security practice. To my surprise, however, when installing an application that runs with JRE, I am immediately greeted with a message \"java wants to make changes. type your password to do this\". This prompt comes before even asking to which directory the files are to be installed (e.g. ~/Applications/). Needless to say, this is not something I am used to when installing similar Java-dependent applications in Linux.\nMy question: is this java prompt granting the whole process admin privileges? Is this prompt something that can be avoided by separating the root and user accounts completely, or is this just how Java works on OS X?\n\nA: On OS X, the administrative password is required for any item that is installed outside of the local user. The reason being is that OS X has a differing file structure (and privilege arrangement) than Linux.\nThe root of OS X is installed to /System. This parent directory is untouched aside from system files (such as OS X updates).\nLibraries, extensions, various plug-ins, and other miscellany used to power some applications are installed to /Library. Applications typically install their files to a folder names Application Support (however, this is not always the case). This parent folder houses files that can be modified by installers run by either the administrator or a user. Installed components affect the entire system (not just a particular user).\nLastly, Applications (which are in actuality folders with the .app suffix) are placed in /Applications. The Mac App Store (MAS) downloads to this directory and users can also drag and drop their applications here. The parent directory is owned by root (and so are applications installed via the MAS) but users do have write access.\nThe folders above (and their children) will require the administrative password to modify, copy, or delete.\nWith respect to MATLAB, the installer likely installs files to /Library (perhaps to Application Support), hence the administrative password requirement.\nI can't speak for MATLAB specifically, but the option to view a packages file structure is available through the OS X's Installer. Simply launch the package (pkg) and then navigate to the menu. It is located under File > Show Files. Here you can see the contents of the VPN Update for Mavericks Server available on Apple's website.\n\nThe request for administrative credentials occurs before the actual need to write the files. It is simply the way a package is built on OS X. Think of it as simply a step in the install procedure rather than one that is bound to a specific event that occurs due to the need for it. During the construction of the installer, the developer would specify these requirements and once specified, it is OS X that delivers them in accordance with Apple's human interface guidelines.\n", "Q: Disable fn-keys for bluetooth keyboard I know that there's a setting to change this behaviour, but it doesn't work for my EasyAcc  bluetooth keyboard.\nIf this behaviour is known, does it apply to all not-built-in keyboards or all bluetooth keyboards?\nEDIT:\nThe setting I'm referring to is:\n\nUse all F1, F2 etc keys as standard function keys\n\nIt doesn't have any effect on my bluetooth keyboard.\nI also tried Palua which also only works on my built-in keyboard.\n\nA: This appears to be a problem across any number of BlueTooth keyboards designed for iOS when you use them on a Mac. I tested three and all have the same problem.\nAttempting to fix it is difficult if not impossible since some testing with my favourite key code tool, Key Codes, shows that the OS is intercepting the keypresses before it gets to the keyboard system.\nIt's not a BlueTooth problem as two different BlueTooth keyboards designed for a PC allowed the setting to work. For example, the Shintaro Mini I use with my Mini media centre works fine.\n", "Q: Automator app with a menubar icon I've created an application with Automator.\nI want to have a new icon in the menubar like this:\n\n\n\nWhich starts the app when I click on it.\nIs it possible? (without using Xcode)\nPS: I don't want a menubar launcher.\n\nA: An Alternative is to use the Applescript.app Script menu.\nShown selected here in the menu bar\n\n\n\nThis menu is normally for easy access to Applescript scripts and will list and run them from the menu.\nBut a quick test shows that that it can also run Automator workflows.\nTo get the menu you need to open Applescript Editor.app which can be found in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder:\n/Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor.app\nOnce open go to it Preferences and under the General Tab check:\n\"Show Script menu in menu bar\"\n\n\n\nYou may want to uncheck \"Show Computer Scripts\"\nYou can now quit Applescript.app and the Applescript menu should be in the Menu Bar.\nNow you select the Applescript Menu and it will have a sub menu \"Open Scripts folder\" to take you to the folder where you can place your workflows. \nSelect the \"Open Script folders\" and then it's sub menu \"Open Users Scripts folder menu to take you to the folder where you can place your workflows. \n\n\n\nA Finder window will open into the Users Scripts folder.  You can now place your .workflow file inside it.\nThe Applescript Menu is dynamic. So Each time you select it it scans its folders to see what is in them and populates the menu accordingly.\nYour .workflow files should show up there. The Menu name will be the name of the file.\n\n\n\nSelecting the Menu for your workflow will run it.\n\nA: No, there's no option to do this in Automator.\nMenu bar items are stored in /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/ with a filetype of menu. Placing apps here won't work, regardless of what program they're made with.\naLaunch and Butler both let you add apps to a menu bar menu though.\n", "Q: Trash log in Mac OS X? My friend accidentally deleted (moved to Trash) all the files listed in \"All my files\" in Finder. Instead of using the \"put back\" option, he moved these files from Trash to Desktop using Finder. Now he has lost the directory structure! Is there a way to put these files where they were deleted from originally? The problem is that \"All my files\" lists the files in one Finder window and when they were moved to the trash, the files appeared as if they were stored in one directory. So I was wondering if there is a way to figure out where these files once were. Any ideas?\nPS Time machine is disabled and no other backups; Mac OS X 10.9.1\n\nA: No - there is no general way to recover the original location of arbitrary files when you move them out of trash and place them on the desktop.\nGladly, they didn't get erased, but this is exactly the job for which Time Machine was created. Now, you can leverage some knowledge about what goes into All My Files to get things back in a reasonable shape:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put obvious files in the correct location - Pictures, Documents, Movies, Music all have folders in the user home folder.\n\n*Create a new smart folder to search the files for \"Where from\" to contain http to locate any files downloaded from the internet (and perhaps placing them back in Downloads folder)\n\n\nAlso, since OS X doesn't really care where most user folders or applications are stored, you don't even need to do anything but file these away in a \"clean later\" folder and apps that need a file will automatically locate the files in their new spot. \n\nA: Finder does not log event like deletion. The only logs you can get are the ones displayed in Console.app. \n", "Q: looking at buy MacBook that needs OS installed I'm looking at getting a MacBook, and the seller did a Factory Reset and said it just needs the OS installed. Is there anything I should look out for?\n\nA: Really, DON'T.\nThe Mac O/S is licensed to be used with a big dongle that prevents it being installed elsewhere. That dongle is called \"A Macintosh.\"\nYeah, wipe the drive before selling. that is what they call \"A Good Idea.\"\nJust remember that a Mac with no O/S on it is a Mac that you can't really run basic diagnostics on:\nDoes it have the hard disk and RAM capacities as indicated?\nDoes everything work? (EG all the ports, WiFi, monitor, etc.)\nSo why didn't they at least reinstall from the media that came with the Mac. or from newer ones, install from the COMMAND-R, internet restore? It doesn't take long. And failing to do that makes me think (correct or not) that they may be trying to hid a problem.\nYeah you can bring an O/S install DVD with you and do some basic checking. or even TechTool Pro and sit there for an hour while it does a comprehensive check on all the hardware.\nBut really, when someone is selling you a Mac with no O/S installed, just say no.\n\nA: An erase of the computer protects the seller from losing private data or giving away software that isn't licensed for resale.\nSimilarly, you should wipe the Mac to ensure no malware is installed. As with any used purchase, you need to do your work to ensure it's not stolen, or broken and feel comfortable with how to contact the seller in a week's time if the transaction wasn't as described.\nIf the deal is too good to be true, it may well be.\n", "Q: Do all Airport Express generations support client mode + Airplay?

My Mac Pro was stolen...I still have the computer ID..can I delete the adobe CS on that computer so I can install it on a new MAC Pro?  I have the CS on my Mac Desk and I would like to install it on my new Mac Pro?\n\nA: You can't actually delete it on the computer that is gone.\nThe problem you may have is that Adobe CS requires product activation which ties the software to that particular computer.\nAdobe allow you to activate CS on two computers so you should be fine to install on your new computer if it's not the third you've done, which from your question it seems it would be.\nIf you have already done it on two computers you will have to get Adobe to deactivate CS on the old computer.

I am wanting to use this app in Mavericks, but the following message pops up when trying to run it, '...[App] is not compatible with Mac OS X 10.9.1':\n\nI am thinking that the app will work just fine, and that the developer has just put a restriction to not allow anything above 10.7.x in some sort of compatibility settings inside its Package Contents - or however OS version checking within an App works on Mac OS.\nIs there a way I can force it to run in Mavericks myself, via something like tweaking with numbers in a file in the .app Package Contents, changing some setting in System Preferences or doing a Terminal tweak of some kind?\n\nA: The above error is not the error provided by OS X. For comparison, this is the OS X error:\n\nThe error you have shown above will have been coded into the app specifically, and therefore not easily bypassed.\nThe best thing to do is contact the developer to see if they have a beta version of the app that you can test. Alternatively, wait for an update.\nAlso, code preventing the running of an app on a certain OS X version would usually have a good reason to exist, especially with utility software such as that. Bypassing it could have downsides…\n\nA: Often times I have seen people delve into the .APP's package contents. In some cases the version checking is done in one of the .plist files inside the app's package.\nSomeone with a little bit of technical knowledge, and a text editor, might be able to modify the correct plist file in the app's package.\nRemember that apps downloaded from the Apple Store are signed cryptographically and changing things inside the package will cause the O/S to not run the app.\n", "Q: Is my Macbook safe? So, I own a macbook but I'm unsure whether I need an antivirus software with real-time scanning capability or not.\nI don't have flash or Java enabled in my browser (using safari).  I've configured my firewall to stealth mode.\nI'm usually on a public network with bunch of other Windows machines as well as Mac and other linux-based computers.\n\nA: It OS X impervious to attack? No. Does malware exist that can affect OS X? Yes. Does OS X benefit from malware protection (AntiVirus software). No. Is your Mac safe? Depends.\nUnderstanding the inherent structure of OS X and the protection built into the system would undoubtedly give you a much better opinion of \"safe.\"\nOS X operates on a certified UNIX core. The architecture of the operating system is not unlike Linux. Linux is undeniably harder to target for attack since it is far more restrictive in granting privileges.\nFiles are either given read, write, or execute privileges. Read and write is self-explanatory, while execute is probably a little less clear. The execute command allows a bit of code to do just that: run. Programs need to access to RAM and other components of the OS to function. Images, documents, movies and other similar files should never be given execute privileges. Unfortunately, in Windows, every file is provided such heightened access which means a nefarious individual can (and has) hide malicious code in a jpeg (or as a zip file). Once launched, the program will then be allowed to execute its commands and begin to infect the system.\nNaturally, as OS X does not grant such privileges, hackers have to be crafty in their attack vectors.\nOS X has now for the past several generations begun to sandbox parts of the OS. This means the code in question is isolated and only given access to specific components it needs to function (rather than having total control). The sandboxing is currently in its early stages, but as it matures, attack vectors will be culled.\nAdditionally OS X employs a service Apple has dubbed GateKeeper. It not only provides a method of protection in which a user can restrict the installation of programs to identified developers (those that have registered their credentials with Apple), but also validates software against a list of known malware (this list is continually being updated by Apple). It's not as robust as an AntiVirus, but it isn't that far off.\nApple has been shifting its own content to the Mac App Store and many other developers have followed suite. The protection offered by this store is unparalleled. Not only does Apple ensure that all its developers are trustworthy, they also rigorously check the code of each app for any malicious activity and go as far as restricting its code to proper, documented APIs. This may mean that software must adopt a more rigid platform, but it also means that every application found within the Mac App Store is entirely free from any nefarious code (the same applies to the App Store for iOS).\nWhile the Internet is still the wild west when it comes to safety, Apple has begun to build a robust platform with security in mind.\nHistorically, OS X has been hit with a very low number of attacks. Mac Defender surfaced some years ago under Snow Leopard under the guise of an AntiVirus software (ironically). The Flashback malware was probably the most prolific and relied on the horrendously insecure java framework. Apple released a removal tool, but also took initiative in shutting down the servers that were tied into the malicious code. The most common attack vector used was a fake update for Adobe Flash Player. The Yontoo Trojan infected a user by way of a browser extension. Incidentally, Safari is safe from extension tampering as every developer must register with Apple as part of the Safari Developer Program and is issued their own certificate to which they must use to sign the extension. Apple can easily revoke this certificate, breaking the extension immediately.\nWhile OS X is far from unhackable, the number of threats it has seen over the years is paltry compared to Microsoft Windows. Most malware found on OS X centres around social engineering, where a user is tricked into installing the malicious code. While a variant of Flashback bypassed the requirement for an administrative password, it is exceptionally rare to see malware of such caliber. Additionally, Apple takes a very proactive stance on security, taking away much of the need for a 3rd party AntiVirus.\nBased on the above, I recommend anyone against running AntiVirus software. OS X is built on a secure platform and most AntiVirus software offers an extremely degraded user experience, mostly because they are built for Windows and then ported to OS X. It is not uncommon for them to either fail at identifying risks or even cause problems themselves.\n\nA: \"Safe\" is not really a black and white condition when it comes to malware and viruses once your computer is capable of connecting to any network. Once you connect you are some amount of unsafe.\nMost Mac users don't run anti-viral software at all and never have a problem. Some get minor malware infestations and the rare person gets a bad malware infestation.\nActual viruses are rare on the Mac.\nSo when you say \"Is my Macbook safe?\" you are asking if the probability of infection is low enough that it isn't worth running anti-viral/anti-malware software, particularly something that constantly scans the Mac.\nThe answer to that is almost certainly.\nPersonally, I run ClamXav once a month and have a close look at the output but don't run the scanner. It's an excellent free package on top of an open source anti-viral package. You can grab it at http://www.clamxav.com/ or on the App store.\n\nA: In addition to the previous two excellent answers, also consider whether you are safe on the public network. If you aren't using \"https\" on all your websites and your mail program isn't set to use only secure authentication (TLS,SSL), then you are still at risk of your password being silently grabbed by one of the other machines. \nDon't use the same password in more than one place. \nApple's own help pages have good information on all these topics. Search there and also in StackExchange for advice on using VPNs and password managers\n", "Q: What counts as a partial charge for my rMBP? I just recently decided to switch over to the Mac for the first time by buying the latest Retina MBP (which shipped with Mavericks).\nI use it like a commuter where I have it unplugged for a couple of hours but later will plug it in at a desk. I want my battery to last as long as possible and I know I should run the battery calibration check and also have the battery down to 10% once a month. \nHowever, what about the \"partial charges\"? What's a good percentage that I can drop down to before plugging it in? I usually start charging when battery is between 50% -60% for now. Is that low enough that it won't hurt the battery in the long term?\n\nA: \"I know I should run the battery calibration check and also have the battery down to 10% once a month.\"\nApple actually recommends fully charging and then discharging the battery once per month. All modern Macs with batteries self-calibrate and require very little user involvement. There is no best practice as to what level to charge a battery at, none that I have seen that equate to a significant elongation in lifespan.\nIn short, use your MacBook Pro and don't worry about its battery. Ideally, as long as you are depleting and recharging it, then the battery's health should remain optimal. Running a notebook that is always connected to a power supply is not ideal. Battery cells like it when the electrons flow; unfortunately it is that very motion that invariably leads to a reduction in charge capacity. That is just the nature of the technology. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\nA partial charge is just that: when a battery is recharged without being fully depleted. Apple rates batteries based on full charge cycles. So if you would let yours run down to 50% and then recharge it, twice, then you would have hit one full charge. There is no relevance as to the health of the battery should you recharge it at any given point. Recharge it when it's convenient for you.\nThe main culprits to poor battery health are heat and inhibiting the movement of electrons (by keeping the notebook plugged in all the time). Avoid those and your's will be just fine.\nYou can consult Apple's suggestions on the matter.\n\nA: Apple has switched from Lithium-Ion batteries to Lithium-Polymer batteries for the MacBook and Macbook Pro models. The Lithium-Polymer battery, like the previous Lithium-Ion, will lose charge capacity over time until it gets to a certain point. \nIt will degrade in charge till it's completely dead.\nThis article might help you out for most questions.\n", "Q: How to use iSight webcam without activating the green light? Recently a the Dutch government advised to put a tape on your webcam to prevent hackers from taking pictures and video using your device (news article in Dutch).\nThe build in iSight camera in Apple laptops have a green light next to the camera, this light turns green when you use the camera.\nIs it possible to use the camera without the activation of the green light? Personally I think the green light turns on when the sensor requires power and this is hardwired in the hardware. Am I wrong?\nI have found similar questions on stackexchange, but I found non that answer this specific question.\n\nA: \"iSeeYou: Disabling the MacBook Webcam Indicator LED\" is a paper by Matthew Brocker and Stephen Checkoway from the Johns Hopkins University. In this paper they explain on how to disable the LED when using the camera. In short: normally you use the CPU to access the camera and activate the LED, but you can also use the processing unit in on the camera board itself and this will not activate the green LED. The authors also provide software to protect you against these problems.\niFixit had the same question and their answer was also based on the same paper:\n\naccording to the researchers, the vulnerability they discovered affects “Apple internal iSight webcams found in earlier-generation Apple products, including the iMac G5 and early Intel-based iMacs, MacBooks, and MacBook Pros until roughly 2008.” While the attack outlined in the paper is limited to these devices, researchers like Charlie Miller suggest that the attack could be applicable to newer systems as well. “There’s no reason you can’t do it -- it’s just a lot of work and resources but it depends on how well [Apple] secured the hardware,” Miller says.\n\nIn short: Yes, the iSight can be used without green light as it is not hardwired.\n\n\nA: My understanding is, it depends on the model of your Macbook. The ability to turn the camera on without the green light was only proven in pre-2008 laptops. No proof exists that you can do the same in post-2008 laptops. \nThis question Are there privacy concerns with the Built-In iSight Camera and LED Indicator? seems to agree that newer models you can't. \n", "Q: Can I use normal headphones in the iPhone 5S jack? I want to use my normal audio headphones with the iPhone to get a better quality of music in my 5S.\nExplain whether it would not affect the phone in any case, if I am using the 3-metal-part audio headphones.\n\nA: The headphone jack on the iPhone 5s can be used by any set of headphones with a standard 3.5mm jack. It will not damage or affect either the headphones or phone in any way.\nThe only difference is that some headphones have buttons that use resistance between the signal and ground wire in the headphone cable control the phone. That's what your Apple Earbuds are doing. Not having this on the headphones is perfectly OK.\nOf course if you have a look around you can find excellent headphones that do have the buttons. I have two different pairs of headphones with good sound, a microphone and phone controls.\n\nA: Your question is pretty vague, but I assume you would like to use non-Apple headphone in your iPhone 5s.\nThis will cause no damage at all, and you can happily do this.\n", "Q: Computer modern font for OSX I need it to make posters with Scribus.\nI got the hint that use the Computer Modern Font.\nHowever, I am not sure if the newest OSX has it, where could I get it from?\n\nA: OS X has never included Computer Modern as standard, only as part of the X11 system. The font was originally created by Donald Knuth using metafont so that he had a good font for his typesetting system, Tex, that he wrote to typeset his books on programming.\nThe modern versions were created to provide a good quality font for the X11/Tex project.\nThe Computer Modern home page is here: http://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/~panov/cm-unicode/ Note that these are the version with the \"Blue Sky\" font hinting that almost everyone uses these days rather than the Knuth originals.\nYou will want the \"otf\" (Open Type Font) file which at the time of writing is ftp://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/pub/Font/cm_unicode/cm-unicode-0.6.3a-otf.tar.gz\nIf you open the application Font Book you can have a look at the fonts installed on the System and install new ones using drag and drop.\nOn a final note, if you arrive at this answer and are going to be doing serious typesetting with Computer Modern you may wish to install the entire American Mathematical Society AMSFonts package available here - it's even packed as a TEXMF directory structure if that is of use to you. Otherwise it contains Postscript fonts well down in the folder hierarchy that can be easily installed on a Mac. It includes other useful fonts and extensions to the basic Computer Modern set. All are free under the SIL Font License.\n\nA: For the users that are more comfortable with using Terminal. You can also install it through Brew using the fonts cask.\nbrew tap homebrew/cask-fonts\nbrew install font-computer-modern\n\n", "Q: Do Australian iPads work in the UK? I wonder if an Australian iPad mini will work in the UK.\nI'm thinking of getting one as a gift for a family member as they're cheaper in Australia than they are in the UK.\nWill it work there app-wise?\n\nA: To use an Australian iPad in the UK you have to consider three things - phone service, AC power and the App Store.\nThe iPad sold in Australia uses the same phone frequencies as the UK version so you just need to be able to replace the existing SIM with a UK one - this means that you don't want to buy your iPad from a phone company under contract here in Australia.\nAC power is fine, you only need a plug adapter or your family member may already have a USB charger to suit.\nThen you get to the App Store. So long as you use an Apple ID registered with a UK address you will get need to use the UK Store, if you use an Apple ID registered in Australia it will have to use the Australian Store.\nSo, to sum up, if you walk into an Apple store here in Australia and buy an iPad and then give it to someone to use in the UK you will be perfectly OK. Don't set it up till you get there and set it up for them and they will love it.\n\nA: I'm using a Candian iPad in The Netherlands. So why wouldn't that combination work? Do you want to get a 3/4G version or WiFi only? You have to get a simlock-free version if you want a Cellular version.\nJust be sure you have a charger, as my European wall-mount does not support the Canadian/American charger.

I would like to know if there was an app that can notify me whenever my mac is powered on. like IFTTT app. example if mac powered on then send a message to iphone.\n\nA: You could certainly script this. There are many approaches that would work. It depends on how comfortable you are with the various tools, and if your Mac automatically logs into a user account.\nIf your Mac automatically logs into your account on powering on, consider using Automator or AppleScript, and Twitter.\nAutomator and Twitter\nConsider combining this article on Automator and Twitter. You could send a private tweet when your account is logged in. Save the workflow as an application and add it your account's Login Items: System Preferences > Users & Groups\nAlternative Approaches\nIf your Mac does not automatically log into a user account, you will need to use a shell script approach. Automator and AppleScript both require an active user session.\nYou could use AppleScript or shell script for sending a messages or e-mail. Add launchd or a third party tool for scheduling the event on start-up or login.\nThis can all be integrated into IFTTT as a trigger.\n", "Q: How can I fix Chrome 32.0.1700.77? CPU use and fonts issues I am on Mountain Lion (OS 10.8.5), and I am using Chrome 32.0.1700.77.  I notice that Chrome (the Google Chrome Helper to be precise) has developed the annoying habit of using ~ 10% of each CPU core (something it did not used to do), and the font rendering is increasingly erratic (i.e. Wikipedia or other pages change fonts as I scroll through a page).  These problems can be either on my computer or a seriously buggy release of Chrome (which did not have these problems for me).  If the former I'd like to have your opinion about a possible fix, if the latter I hope a new release of Chrome will come out soon...\n\nA: According to this thread one of the possible culprits is the Chrome Extension AdBlock (which is pretty nice to have).  A second possible culprit is some of the catalog indexing done by Quicksilver -- when I disabled the indexing of running processes and restarted Chrome I noticed a solid improvement in terms of lower CPU usage.  The CPU usage is still, annoyingly, going up, albeit slowly, and I think this is due to Adblock (or maybe another extension, but I only have about 5).  Because I like to avoid ads I will keep the Adblock extension running and restart Chrome from time to time until the issue is resolved.\nBasically Chrome's CPU usage might be due to other apps interacting with it (Quicksilver in my case), and also due to Chrome Extensions, so it is worthwhile exploring these two avenues to try and improve Chrome's resources usage.\nI have not found a cause or a cure for the erratic font behaviour.\nAddendum 27/1/2014:  another big improvement seems to be had by (1) installing the official Adobe's Flash Plugin and (2) deactivating Chrome's own Flash plugin so that it uses the Adobe's version.\nAddendum 29/1/2014:  yesterday Chrome autoupdated to 32.0.1700.102, and the issues of CPU usage seem resolved, i.e. there was little I could do on my end.  To be honest I do not have the time to chase which plugin might minimise CPU use and whatnot, I hope Google will avoid releasing updates that have CPU usage bugs.\nAddendum 3/2/2014:  despite all the above Chrome's CPU usage would still creep up, slowly but inexorably.  I reset to factory defaults, reset the fonts to the 'defaults' and thus far the CPU use seems to be under control.\n", "Q: How can I Create a Recovery Partition on a Newly Installed SSD? I have a late-2011 15\" MacBook Pro.\nI have just had my spinning hard drive swapped out with an SSD. The new drive does not have a recovery partition. Can I create one? If so, how?\nMy laptop is well backed up with Time Machine. I also have a license for SuperDuper, and so can create a bootable external hard drive to boot from if I need to. I don't mind having to wipe my drive completely in order to set it up properly.\n\nA: Reinstall OS X using the Internet Recovery option (hold Command+R during boot).\nDuring the reinstall, OS X will create a local Recovery HD. You also won't need to backup your data as it will simply reinstall the core operating system without touching your existing content. \n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner will copy the entire drive including the Recovery Partition (SuperDuper doesn't copy Recovery Partition last I checked) \nhttp://www.bombich.com/ccc_features.html\nUsing C.C.C. you can directly image your old HDD drive onto your new SSD if there is enough space available. \nYou will need a firewire/usb/thunderbolt external HD case to copy over directly. The external HD case needs to be bootable if original HDD is already removed.\nThere is also the option to remove your SuperDrive/DVD drive and install a HDD drive adaptor in the optical bay. (Exteral cases for Superdive/DVD are available.)

A process using 1GB RAM is not in itself likely to be the cause of problems. Your MacBook Pro is likely 64-bit and is designed to work with much larger volumes of memory.\nIf you are running OS X 10.9 or later, try watching the Activity Monitor's Memory information.

Nothing else happens.\nRunning safe boot mode ends in the same state.\nSo I have tried running verbose, the last line is:\nExecuting fsck_hfs (version hfs-226.1.1)\n\nIf I do a hard shutdown and start the verbose mode again, I can see in logs (last lines)\nExecuting fsck_hfs...\nhfs: Removed 0 orphaned / unlinked files and 4 directories\n\nI have started the system in single user mode.\nI ran the fsck on it, it worked just as expected:\nfsck -fyd \n\nI've retried it twice before I got a note saying that file system is ok.\nReboot: same issue.\nI can access all of the files and stuff on the raid when in single user mode, but there's no way the system will boot.\nI woud love to hear some opinions, please limit the answers/comments to system tools or free tools available on the internet.\nAlso, there's no way I'm going to remove the drives and attach to another system.\n\nA: When you use Apple software to stripe the two internal drives of a Mac Mini, the recovery hard disk is removed. That means you will need to boot from a next journal drive to run Disk Utility and figure out what happened to the volume structure.\nFast SDHC cards are getting so inexpensive that I pretty much make one of those for every Mac Mini so it has a recovery OS to boot from for maintenance like this. Of course a USB drive works well too. \nGet yourself a new drive and worst case, use internet recovery to install the OS on to an external drive so you have something to boot from. If you have a backup, you could wipe the two drives and run internet recovery as well to just fix or reinstall the OS on the empty drives. \n", "Q: Is an external drive connected to Time Capsule also backed up? If I connect an external hard drive to a Time Capulse, it that drive also backed up to the Time Capsule?\n\nA: No, that won't work. Simply connecting the external drive to the Time Capsule wouldn't start a backup by itself, because, counter-intuitive as it may seen, a Time Capsule doesn't know anything about backups: the Time Capsule is, in effect, just a network attached drive -- it doesn't back up anything by itself, but rather just makes storage space available to a Mac to be used, among other things, for backups; such backups must be entirely managed by that Mac, running the Time Machine software provided by OS X, which is what actually performs the backup process. No Mac, no automatic backup.\nWhat Time Machine can do is back up an external hard drive physically connected to your Mac (via Thunderbolt or USB), so long as it is formatted using HFS -- if it's in FAT32 or NTFS format, Time Machine won't back it up. That's not your case, since you've plugged the drive to the Time Capsule and not the Mac -- the only way you can access that drive from your Mac (which, as explained above, is what actually performs the backup) is via the network. Quoting from Pondini's excellent Time Machine web site:\n\nTime Machine can easily back up multiple internal and/or directly-connected external drives and partitions simultaneously (but Time Machine cannot back up data that's on a network).\n\nSo if you really want to back that drive up, you'll have to connect it directly to a Mac, make sure it is in HFS format, and follow the instructions on the link above.\n\nA: No — the Time Capsule is simply a hard drive that Time Machine on OS X can back up to.\nIt doesn't manage its own backups of drives connected to the Time Capsule. If you wish to back up this drive, use Time Machine on OS X and select that drive as one of the drives that you wish to back up.\n", "Q: How long can my MacBook Pro sustain greater than 100% CPU usage? The Activity Monitor app says my macbook pro 10.7.5 is at 300% CPU usage when I'm trying to install and sync my Bitcoin-Qt client. \nI let in run like this with the fan going crazy for 4 hours without incident, but stressed about it the whole time.\nIs that level of CPU usage sustainable? Is this 300% number even accurate to what is going on?\ndetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5 \n\n*Memory: 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 \n\n*Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB\n\n\nA: The thing is that 100% CPU usage refers to a single one of the cores in your CPU being fully loaded (or an equivalent load distributed among all the cores). I assume your MacBook Pro has a dual core CPU with HyperThreading; that's 2 physical cores plus 2 logical cores exposed by HyperThreading. Thus, you could in theory achieve as high as 400% CPU usage (4 cores times 100% each).\nAs to whether it is sustainable, in principle it should be, if the cooling system is in order and the cooling vents are not clogged with dust or blocked by any objects. Even if it's not and you reach supposedly dangerous temperatures, the CPU should throttle itself to prevent any damage.\n\nA: 300% means that you're using 3 cores at 100%, or 4 cores at 75%. 100% is one core on max.\nIt's perfectly fine for an app to use more than 100% — it just means it's using multiple cores.\n", "Q: How to change apple ID while it has been disabled for security reasons I just bought apple iPhone 4s from my friend but it throw an error \"This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons\" is it possible that i change apple ID during this state? Or  is there any other way to change it?\n\nA: According to this Apple KB article, it may be a case of entering the password incorrectly too many times, in which case you can try resetting the password at Apple's iForgot site.\nAnother option, if you don't have any purchases linked to that Apple ID, is creating a new one using a different email address. You just have to sign out of the current Apple ID (if that's even necessary) and sign up for a new one. All of that is done from within Settings -> iTunes & App Store, although the sign up process might be easier to do on a computer with a real keyboard, from within iTunes (Store menu -> Create Apple ID...)\n", "Q: How to pass keyboard hotkeys from VMWare Windows VM back to OSX host? I'm running VMWare 5 on a MacBook Pro, and I'd like to be able to send certain combinations of keys out to OSX while working in my Windows VM.  I've set up a couple Automator scripts that do Play/Pause/Next on my Google Music tab in Chrome when I hit Ctrl-Cmd-Z, Ctrl-Cmd-X, and so on.  They work great while I'm using any other OSX app, but VMWare traps the keys and routes them to Windows, so that they no longer function as global hotkeys.\nIs there a way to fix this?  I see options to map certain keys on the Mac keyboard to others in Windows, but no way to do the reverse.\n\nA: That's easy.\nDisable the Auto Capture Keyboard.\n", "Q: Is there a fast way to switch System time zone from the command line? I usually do it through the System Preference panel for Date & Time, but I'd like a quicker way to do this if there is one.\n\nA: Use the following Terminal command:\nsudo systemsetup -settimezone timezone\n\nFor a list of valid timezone values, use sudo systemsetup -listtimezones.\nTo get the current timezone, use:\nsudo systemsetup -gettimezone\n\n\nA: Additionally:\nPrinting a random timezone:\nruby -e \"puts `sudo systemsetup -listtimezones`.lines.sample.strip\"\n\nSetting a random timezone:\nsudo systemsetup -settimezone (ruby -e \"puts `sudo systemsetup -listtimezones`.lines.sample.strip\")\n\nFinding a timezone (e.g. containing \"Los\" in this case):\nsudo printf ''; sudo systemsetup -listtimezones | grep Los\n\n", "Q: MacPro Hard Drive 3 TB or Larger formatted to Logical Volume Group by Disk Utility I have an Intel MacPro in which I recently installed a new internal 3TB hard disk.\nI attempted to format it in Disk Utility using the standard GUID partition map and encountered a strange problem. Disk Utility formatted it using a Logical Volume Group (LVG) instead of GUID.\nFurthermore, Disk Utility subsequently refused to allow me to reformat or repartition this drive. The Partition Layout drop-down in Disk Utility is greyed-out. I seem to be stuck with a LVG drive.\nSpecifics\n\nModel: MacPro Quad Core (Early 2009/Nehalem MacPro4,1)\nSystem: OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5\nDisk Utility: Version 13 (450)\nHard Disk: Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001 3TB\n\nHow can I remove the Logical Volume Group partition scheme and reformat this drive in the GUID standard recommend by Apple?\n\nA: This problem has been reported to occur on Intel MacPro's using internal drives from various manufactures with capacities >= 3 TB. Specifically, it's been reported when using Disk Utility in OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and Mavericks (10.9).\nAlthough there have been solutions involving using diskutil in Terminal posted here at AskDifferent and elsewhere on the web, I found a simpler solution: Format the disk using Disk Utility from an OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) Install DVD.\n\nWarning: This solution will cause you to lose all data on the drive.\n\n*\n\n*Backup any valuable data from the drive in question.\n\n*Reboot using the OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) Install DVD. (Hold down the C-Key to boot from the DVD.)\n\n*Choose your language (eg. English).\n\n*Instead of installing OS X, choose Disk Utility from the Utilities menu.\n\n*Select your drive from the pane on the left of the Disk Utility screen.\n\n*Choose the Partition tab.\n\n*Select your desired Partition Layout.\n\n*Select Mac OS Extended (Journaled) under Format:\n\n*Check the Options button and verify that GUID is selected as the partition scheme.\n\n*Click the Apply button and verify you want to proceed.\n\n*When the partition and format process is complete, quit Disk Utility and reboot.\n\n\nThe disk will now be correctly formatted using a GUID partition table.\n(If you need to repartition or reformat the drive in the future, you will need to repeat this process. Hopefully Apple will fix this bug in a later version of Disk Utility.)\n", "Q: It's possible to forward/reverse a track with Apple EarPods remote?

I am slowly migrating from an older Mac Pro to a MacBook Air. Both machines are backed up to two different 2TB drives using Time Machine. Recently I decided that I wanted to make the extensive data I have on my older Mac Pro more available to my MacBook Air, so I bought a 1TB portable drive which I can keep with me.\nI moved approx. 430GB of data onto the portable drive ('SideCarlson'). This was enough data that I figured trying to back it up while associated with the Air would not work (I read somewhere that if TM is backing up two different computers, it can't delete old backups of the OTHER computer to make room for the current one)\nSo, I backed it up while associated to the Mac Pro.\nQuestion: Can I drag this backup to the new machine's backup? (See screenshot)\nI'm assuming I would need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure both machines' backups are current (I see both have a backup in progress)\n\n*Turn off Time Machine in Mac Pro ('jPro')\n\n*Restore 'SideCarlson' from the MacBook Air ('Air Carlson')\n\n\nThanks for your help :)\n\nA: No, you can't do this. The folder you've selected doesn't contain the entire backup, just the changes from the last backup, and many symlinks to the older data contained in other backups. Such symlinks will break if you do this.\n\nA: It seems that modifying an existing backup won't work. What you CAN do, is move a complete backup to another machine's backup, so one level higher than your example. So look for the backup that contains the last version of the directory you want, then move the complete backup. This won't take up any extra space. Next time you do a normal backup on the machine you moved it to, it'll recognise that volume and go incremental on that one. This works.\nI did the moving in the terminal after sudo -i, because in the finder this does not work.\nDid this in Big Sur by the way. A bit late, this post is 7 years old, but should be helpfull for other people in the future!\n", "Q: Spotlight: Search flagged Mail Messages I'm looking for a way to have all mail messages flagged/labeled with \"Red\" show up in a saved search in the Finder, but Mail.app flags doesn't seem to be indexed by Spotlight. \nAny ideas?\nMavericks (10.9)\n\nA: You can search for tags in Spotlight using the following syntax:\ntag:name\n\nFor example, to search for all messages with Stack Exchange that are tagged Red, do:\nStack Exchange tag:Red\n\n", "Q: iPhone/iPad/iPod turn-off blocking? Its possible to block turning off the iPhone/iPod or iPhone?\nFor example, in case of loss, theft? \nThe point is that the thief could not turn off the iPhone, so I could find iPhone through Find my iPhone always..\n\nA: No.\nEven devices locked with TouchID can be turned off without unlocking.

I am trying to share my diary with my wife, we both use the OS X Calendar and I decided to sync using iCloud.\nI also have calendars in Calendar synced through Google.\nI went into System Preferences > iCloud and ticked Calendars. It told me it would merge all my calendars data in Calendars on My Mac to the Calendars in iCloud which is what I wanted.\nI said OK, it then whirred away for about three minutes and then all my calendars on My Mac disappeared and were replaced by iCloud calendars, a bit more whirring and then I saw an error saying it couldn't access iCloud at this time, try again now or try later, I tried now several times and later as well all to no avail.\nGetting desperate I went into System Preferences > iCloud and un-ticked Calendars. It told me all Calendar data would be deleted on my mac which I was not concerned about as I was well backed up.\nAll iCloud Calendars disappeared from the side pane leaving only the Google calendars left.\nThis is my challenge: I can't create a Calendar on My Mac. When I go to File > New Calendar, there is no option to create on on My Mac which was there before, in fact no option to create anything.\nI have tried the usual computer reboot and logging out of iCloud to no avail.\nI have logged onto iCloud and some of my Calendars are there but at this point I would be happy just to be able to get back to square one with my Calendars re-created on My Mac. \nAny ideas greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You can't create events without a calendar to put them in, and you can't create calendars without an account. Since you have no available cloud service, you need to create the calendars in the On My Mac account.\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely log out and remove all accounts that could store calendars, including iCloud and Google.\n\n*Open Calendars → Preferences → Accounts (Not Calendars → Accounts).\n\n*Select the On My Mac account and check the Enable this account box.\n\n", "Q: Hackintosh / VMWare AMD 7950 Chipset I currently have a Mac OS X Mavericks VM running on a Windows 7 machine in VMware Workstation.

It's a limit on the VMWare graphics card and failing the Logic install checker.\nYou can try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Logic9 package, right-click and choose Show Original\n\n*Choose LogicStudio.mpkg. Right-click and choose Show Package Contents\n\n*Go to Contents/Resources/Requirements Checker.app\n\n*Right-click, and choose Show Package Contents\n\n*Find Checker.app, navigate to Contents/Resources -> file minsys.plist\n\n*Edit it, replacing every\n\"block\" with \"warn\"\n\n*Save the file.\n\n\nNow run the install and it should pass the check.\nThis same issue impacts genuine Mac's which don't have the required RAM or graphics cards, etc.\n", "Q: 2013 Late Macbook Pro constantly mute completely? I find there are some cases where my Macbook becomes completely mute, meaning each application cannot make any sound. Even while adjusting the volume, there is no sound during the operation.\nOne already spotted action that leads to this case is I make it sleep first, and then wake it up. Then, the computer is completely mute. I am sure there are some other cases.\nThe only solution is restarting the computer.\nHow may I fix it? Bring it to AppleCare?\n\nA: Does this occur when you have stereo or headphones plugged into the jack, or only when using the computer's speakers?\nIf it is only when trying to use the built-in speakers, then probably there is some dirt or lint in your headphone jack outlet, and the computer thinks that something is plugged in there.\nYou can try compressed air (safe) or a paperclip (not as safe), or just go to the Genius Bar and let them sort it out.\n\nA: After consulting AppleCare, I finally solved this issue perfectly. I post my solution here so that the future users may solve it easily when they reach Apple S.X..\nDelete two files:\ncom.apple.audio.DeviceSettings and com.apple.audio.SystemSettings.\nThen do the NVRAM restarting to your MacBook to reset the audio settings.

folders. What should I do to fix this issue?\n\nA: There are two possibilities. The font could be \"disabled\" or there could be a problem with the font files.\nRun Font Book and have a look to see if the font is marked as Off in either your computer or user list.\nThen highlight the font in the font list and select File > Validate Font and the font will be checked. This is quite a swift process so I usually check them all. A dialog will open that lists all the fonts and shows you the ones that may have a problem. The most common (and easily ignored) warning is that you have a duplicate font but if you have a duplicate of one you are having a problem with I'd remove the 'User' version.\nIf that doesn't work then you might try File > Restore Standard Fonts... which moves all the non-standard fonts out of the way into a folder called Fonts (Removed) next to the Fonts folder.\n\nA: Actually you don't have the correct version of Helvetica in the right spot.\nYou are missing the files Helvetica.dfont and HelveticaNeue.dfont which are the correct files for the missing fonts. They should be in /System/Library/Fonts. Have a good look at the support page you point to and you will see those two files listed against the fonts.\nYou do have two files, Helvetica.ttc and HelveticaNeue.ttc, which are not included in a standard Mavericks install but they are not where the System is expecting to find the two fonts.\nAs an experiment move these two files into ~/Library/Fonts and see what happens (I'd be interested to know the result).\nIn the long term grab a copy of the two missing files from another Mac running 10.8 or 10.9 and put them into /System/Library/Fonts. You will have to do this by hand since Font Book will only install fonts in either /Library/Fonts or ~/Library/Fonts.\n", "Q: How to move from iTunes book library to iBooks app On my last mac system I used iTunes for syncing some PDFs and other books to my ipad.\nNow on my new MBP with Mavericks and iTunes 11 there is no Books library anymore, but a new iBooks app.\nI started to add some files to iBooks on my mac and followed the instructions to sync them to my ipad, but when opening iTunes and clicking the Books sync section, I still see only the old books formerly added to iTunes in the list. No new book from iBooks is being shown, so not synced to iPad.\nI even don’t see a way to delete my old content (and move it to iBooks), because there is no library anymore.\nJust deleting the Books folder under iTunes Library didn’t work - the Books sync section still shows the old content, although the sync now complains that it can’t find the files. (Deleting Cache files didn't work here)\nSo how can I actually enable iBooks app content sync from Mac to iPad and get rid of my former iTunes books library?\n\nA: I finally managed it by re-creating my iTunes library as mentioned here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1451.\nAfter moving the .itl file I also moved the Books folder under iTunes Music.\nIt takes quite some time to import, depending on the size of the library, and it will finally warn that some items could not be found - which is obvious after deleting Books.\nAfter that the contents of iBooks appeared in the Books sync tab.\nEdit: Unfortunately, all my apps for my i-devices were gone, too. I had to manually transmit them device by device via the menu item File>Devices>Transfer Purchases from (device name). This step is clearing all the apps that I haven't synched to any of the devices at this time, which might be good or bad. However, I can download them again if I'm in the need for that.\n", "Q: Useless Eject key on Apple Wireless Keyboard I have an Apple Wireless Keyboard that has an eject key on the top right. It is useless because my Retina MacBook Pro does not have a CD-ROM. \nMy MacBook is running OS X Mavericks and I expected eject key to do some power operations, just like the power key on the top-right of MacBook keyboard.\nThis key is useless now. How can I get it mapped?\n\nA: You can use Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) to remap the eject key. Short presses of eject won't get registered unless you also install NoEjectDelay though.\nThis private.xml maps the eject key to a power button or key:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <autogen>__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::EJECT, KeyCode::VK_IOHIDPOSTEVENT_NX_POWER_KEY</autogen>\n </item>\n</root>\n\nThis makes pressing eject open Finder:      \n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <vkopenurldef>\n    <name>KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER</name>\n    <url>file:///System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app</url>\n  </vkopenurldef>\n  <item>\n    <name>Eject to Open Finder</name>\n    <identifier>Eject to Open Finder</identifier>\n    <autogen>__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::EJECT, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER</autogen>\n </item>\n</root>\n\n\nA: The wireless keyboard can be used with systems that do still have an optical drive, and if you had an external USB SuperDrive for your MacBook Pro, it would function for that.\nYour power operations have always been on the eject key using modifier keys; only recently was the power key introduced as part of the keyboard itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*controleject will give you a dialog box where you can choose to go to sleep, restart or shut down.\n\n*commandoptioneject will go straight to sleep.\n\n*controlcommandeject will restart.\n\n*controloptioncommandeject will shut down.\n\n*controlshifteject will sleep your display only.\n\n\nA: Ejector is a paid app that repossesses the eject key for other storage volumes e.g. USB drives, SD cards and mounted disk images etc.\n\nImage: Ejector\nI have no affiliation with the developer. I discovered the app reading a Cult of Mac article.\n", "Q: Compose Message Shortcut Is there a keyboard shortcut to open Notification Center and begin an iMessage as seen below?\n\n\nA: The short answer is \"no\" but you can get around that if you try hard.\nSee this answer, Does Notification Center have keyboard shortcuts? for one way using AppleScript and Services. It refers to tweeting but the principle is the same for iMessage.\nYou can also set a keyboard shortcut to open Notification Centre then use tab to move to the iMessage button and space to open the new message dialog.\n", "Q: iPhone -- shutting off cell service, but not gps Airplane mode turns off GPS service as well as cell service.  Is this necessary under the new rules allowing most devices (at least on some airlines) to be used during all phases of flight?\nIf it's not necessary, is there a way to turn off cell service while leaving the GPS system functioning?\n\nA: With my experience, being 30,000 feet above earth and traveling at around 500mph, the GPS has a very hard time finding my location. Even if it does find my location, the map itself doesn't load due to a lack of cellular data. \nHowever, you can always manually turn off wifi, bluetooth, cellular data, and leave location services on.\n", "Q: Correct battery voltage for new MacBook Pro battery I have a 17\" Macbook Pro (5,2 mid 2009,  MC226LL/A) that has a battery that is in need of being replaced.\nI'm looking for the correct battery for it and have found various batteries that say they are compatible. The odd thing is that some of the batteries that are said to be compatible have a voltage that is higher than the original.\nMy battery is model A1309 with a voltage of 7.3V and 95Wh. But batteries that I've seen listed as compatible with model MC226LL/A have a voltage of 10.95V and 95Wh. Does this difference in voltage matter?\n\nA: Batteries are the one thing in a laptop you shouldn't mess with -- I'm fairly sure they're the only component in your computer that is in a constantly controlled risk of overheating, catching fire or quite literally exploding. When they are not made to the utmost standards of quality, you could be, again quite literally, putting your life at risk. I'm not saying this is the case with you, and fortunately not with me, but if I were unable to afford a new manufacturer-supplied battery to replace a dying one in my laptop, I would rather sell it and buy a cheaper laptop whose battery I could afford.\nI agree Apple's markup on batteries -- and quite generally most of the accessories they sell -- is excessive, but batteries and chargers (due to the risk of electric shock) are two things I would never buy from anyone but Apple. If you search around you will find teardowns of original Apple chargers and cheap Chinese knockoffs, and even if you have zero knowledge of electronics, you can tell the Apple chargers are much higher quality than the Chinese knockoffs. This is quite hard to tell with batteries, but do you believe for a moment the lowest bidder won't cut costs exactly as they do with chargers?\nAnd just to stay on topic, yes the battery is quite important. 7.3 V sounds like a two cell Li-ion configuration while 10.95 V would be a three cell Li-ion battery. Using a two-cell battery in place of a three-cell battery or vice-versa is a sure-fire recipe for disaster -- even if the electronics could take the different voltage, over-charging a two cell battery with enough voltage for a three cell battery would immediately damage it. In case of a high quality battery, only the protection circuit would be damaged, but in case of a low-quality knockoff with no protection circuits, the battery would be immediately and irreversibly damaged, with a symptom of either swelling, fire or an explosion.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro won't display external monitor when lid is closed I hate that I'm having to ask this, because it's been working perfectly fine until now. I use my macbook pro as my home computer and hook it up to an external monitor and keyboard when I'm home. I do disconnect it on occasion. I unplugged it today and when I went to plug it back in and shut the lid, my monitor is saying \"no connection.\" The monitor works fine with the lid open, but I used to be able to close it no problem. \nHelp!!\n\nA: I faced the same issue few days back after being able to successfully close the laptop lid with my external monitor connected all the while. For me it started working back after connecting the power cord to the laptop. Without power, laptop does not seem to mirror the display to the external monitor with the lid closed. hope this helps.\n\nA: If you want to disable lid sleep regardless if you're on AC or battery, install Insomniac. I use this app all of the time with my mbp, since I don't really like being connected to power all of the time.\n\nA: This is a feature of OS X to save battery. It is the same reason you can't start charging a device without the MB being plugged in or already open. \nYou can try to search MacUpdate for an app that disables this. Or maybe even a Terminal command. \n\nA: You'll need to have an external keyboard, mouse and the power cable plugged in to achieve what you're tyring to do. \n", "Q: mac os x what the two forward slash root is? On my mac os x I have two roots the second one has two forward slashes. //  wondering what that is. I searched everywhere but cant find any information about this. \n\nA: This is a strange part of the POSIX specification.\nSee unix, difference between path starting with '/' and '//'.\nTwo slashes in the beginning of a pathname are interpreted in an implementation-defined way. As far as I know, only cygwin actually takes // to mean something different than / (//FOO maps to a network drive called FOO, / maps to the local root). On most other systems / and // are the same. Note that /// is interpreted as /.\nYour shell is I suspect bash and it keeps the // just in case the OS does something special with it. On OSX it is the same as /.\n", "Q: How can I switch between textmate and terminal quickly? Is it possible to have a short cut so I can jump between Textmate and terminal quickly?\nI know I can do it via cmd+tab but I still have to find it from the menu bar.\n\nA: There are a couple of ways doing this.\nThe quickest and easiest is to use Spaces.\nPut Textmate on Desktop 4 and Terminal on Desktop 3\nThen you can use ctrl-option and either 3 or 4 to switch between the two.\nPersonally I use Keyboard Maestro for this. I used to use a Service and a keyboard shortcut but a \"feature\" of the new security system makes it impossible for a Service to use the System Event library unless you turn on accessibility for every app. You need that to select \"Bring All to Front\".\n\nA: I currently use KeyRemap4MacBook to assign shortcuts to applications. For example this private.xml would make F7 open iTerm and control-option-command-M open TextMate:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <vkopenurldef><name>KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_ITERM</name><url>file:///Applications/iTerm.app</url></vkopenurldef>\n  <vkopenurldef><name>KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_TEXTMATE</name><url>file:///Applications/TextMate.app</url></vkopenurldef>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F7 | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_ITERM</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::M, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_TEXTMATE</autogen>\n </item>\n</root>\n\nIf you have bought the Powerpack for Alfred, you can create a workflow like this:\n\nHotkeys have a short delay by default, but you can reduce it by changing the trigger behavior:\n\n\nA: If you're on OS X Lion or later, you can place the two applications on neighboring spaces. Then use gestures to switch between them. I know terminal supports full screen; not sure about TextMate, though.\nMake sure you turn off auto-arrangement in the Mission Control preferences, if you wish. This can effect the order of your apps. I find it annoying.\n\nA: If you use Alfred and have the powerpack, setting up a workflow to switch to a specific application is easy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Alfred's Preferences.\n\n*Click the Workflows button.\n\n*Add a new, blank workflow using the '+' button at the bottom of the window.\n\n*Fill in the Workflow name, for example \"Switch to Terminal\" and any other info you want and click Save.\n\n*Using the round '+' button in the top right corner, add a hotkey from the Triggers menu.\n\n*Set the Hotkey to whichever key combination you want to use. Leave the other defaults.\n\n*Again using the round '+' button, add an action 'Launch Apps / Files'\n\n*Find Terminal in the Finder and drag it into the empty list and click Save\n\n*Connect the Hotkey command to the Launch action by moving the mouse pointer over the side of the hotkey and clicking and dragging the small 'knob' that appears over to the launch action.\n\n\nDo the same for TextMate and you're done, having two shortcuts to switch to the application you want. (Yes, the action says launch, but if an app is already open Alfred will switch to it instead.)\n\nA: I use iTerm2 for this.\nIt can be configured to open and close a terminal window using a hotkey.\nMy setup is such that tapping Ctrl twice brings up a full-screen terminal window with slightly transparent background, so that I can see what's behind it. Tapping Ctrl twice again hides the window.\n", "Q: Apple Magic Mouse is discoverable, but not pairing Just got Apple Magic Mouse from eBay. I cannot figure how to pair it with my Mac Mini: it's discovering fine, but when I click on Pair button, my Mac is thinking for a little while and says: \"Couldn't connect to the device\".\nWhen I'm trying to pair the mouse with Windows 7, I get a different error: Authentication failed. The code I entered is default 0000.\nThe mouse was described as New (other), but it seems not. It already has a name: Cora's mouse.\nIs there any way how can I get it working?\n\nA: My issue was that my Magic Mouse was discoverable through the Bluetooth Preferences pane, but when I clicked 'Pair', it couldn't connect. After an hour, I found a solution that worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the Magic Mouse\n\n*Open the Bluetooth Preferences\n\n*Delete your mouse's profile\n\n*Be sure the Bluetooth Prefs pane is searching (indicated by the spinner)\n\n*Hold the mouse button down, then flip the switch to turn it on (it should blink green during this time\n\n*While still holding down the mouse button, click 'Pair' in the Bluetooth Prefs pane\n\n\nA: I would change the batteries in the mouse and see if that fixes anything.\n\nA: Follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the mouse by holding down the power button until the light goes out.\n\n*Turn on the mouse by pressing the power button, and keep the power button pressed until it is paired. The light on the mouse will start blinking, it will show up in Bluetooth Preferences, and you will be able to pair it almost immediately so long as you  do not let go of the power button from the moment of turning it on until after the mouse is paired.\n\nA: Turns out my mouse was broken. I returned it and got a refund.\n", "Q: opening file from text wrangler to terminal I'm sure this is a very basic question, but I'm just beginning to learn programming and I've gotten to a lesson where I have to create a file in text wrangler, save it to the desktop (called test.txt) and then copy it into the terminal. I then have to use the \"less\" command to view the file. How do I get that file from my desktop into the command line? and I'm using a mac fyi..\n\nA: Open up Terminal.\nYour Desktop is at ~/Desktop (the ~ is a shortcut for your home folder) so cd ~/Desktopreturn to go there then less test.txtreturn\nBy the way, if you are going to use TextWrangler and Terminal you might want to visit http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/ and download the TextWrangler command line tools which allow you to open a file in TextWrangler from the command line, among other things.\n", "Q: Apple TV Not Waking on Demand for Computer Behind Switch I can Home Share between a Mac Mini, Mac Pro, and my AppleTV with no problems as long as the two computers are awake. The ATV finds and streams the libraries with no problems.\nThe Mac Mini and ATV are connected to a switch, while the Mac Pro is connected directly to the router. Everything is on the same subnet and has the same IP range, and everything is wired (not using Wi-Fi).\nIf the Mac Pro is asleep, the ATV seems to be able to wake it on demand and stream it's library (after I added specific port forwarding rules to my router as suggested by Apple - details below). Again, the Mac Pro is connected directly to the router.\nThe main problem is with the Mac Mini, which, along with the ATV, is connected via a switch. If that computer is asleep, it will not wake up and the ATV can not stream it's library. \nOne weird thing I've noticed is that if both computers are awake, the ATV shows both libraries as available to stream. If I sleep everything (including the ATV) then wake it up, both computers appear as available to stream, but when I click in to the Mini's library it fails to load.\nAlso, the last time I checked, Wake on Demand was working over Wi-Fi, but I'd prefer to keep as many devices hard wired.\nAbout My Setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Router:\n\n\n*\n\n*IP Address in the range of 192.150.23.xxx\n\n*Subnet on 255.255.255.128 (This was done in order to port forward to the broadcast IP address. On a standard subnet of 255.255.255.0, my router wouldn’t let me forward to 255.255.255.255. I read that I could change the subnet to 255.255.255.128 and broadcast to 255.255.255.127.\n\n*Port forwarding: everywhere I read on the web recommended forwarding port 7 over UDP to my broadcast IP address of 192.150.23.127. After speaking with Apple, they also recommending doing the same with ports 1900, 5350, 5351, and 5353.\n\n*I verified this subnet change and port forwarding is working as expected because I downloaded an iPhone app called mWOL and it can send a magic packet and wake any computer I point it to.\n\n\n*Mac Mini:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wired connection to switch\n\n*Energy Saver > Wake for network access checked\n\n*iTunes open\n\n\n*Mac Pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wired connection to router\n\n*Energy Saver > Wake for network access checked\n\n*iTunes open\n\n\n*AppleTV:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wired connection to switch\n\n\n\nAny ideas what could be happening? Could the magic packet be getting swallowed when sent to the Mini? Perhaps related to the fact that I’m using a switch?\n\nA: I would think that the magic packet is indeed getting \"swallowed\" by the switch.\nI suspect that the UDP broadcast packet containing the WOL magic packet is going through the switch from the ATV while the Mini is switched out. Could you replace it with a hub or router for a time to test? UDP broadcast is always fun.\nCan you wake the Mini from the Pro?\nIf you can then that tells us that WOL is working on the Pro and the problem is indeed the switch. You need to configure the switch so that it somehow holds and rebroadcasts the UDP broadcast packet on all ports.\nThe problem is that the ATV and Mini are on the same switch.\nWhat is the brand and model of the switch?\n", "Q: How to deactivate the ZTE Connect Manager for Mac? The Connect Manager for Mac that comes with the ZTE LTE modem model MF821 keeps running even when the modem is not in use, after doing Force Quit in Activity Manager, after kill -9 in Terminal, and across restarts. The program is poorly written, as it periodically causes CPU load spikes, during some of which the computer restarts itself. How can I deactivate Connect Manager?\n\nA: It turns out that the program is managed by launchd. Further, it is configured to keep itself running at all times. Thus, you must remove it from the launchd configuration. Open Terminal and run the following command:\n$ launchctl remove cn.com.zte.zConnectManager.plist\n\nThis will keep the program from reactivating itself. Note the behavior in the following conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*After plugging in the modem, the program no longer automatically connects. You must open it (search on \"4G LTE\"). I have to open it twice for some reason.\n\n*When you close the program, it secretly remains running. You must open Activity Monitor, search on 'Connect Manager', and then select it and select the Quit button (octagon with an 'X'), then select 'Quit'. After this, it will not reactivate until you restart it.\n\n*When you unplug the modem the program will close its window and you must deactivate it in the same way as above.\n\n\n==UPDATE==\nI've found that I must periodically run the following:\n$ launchctl remove cn.com.zte.zLogging.plist\n$ launchctl remove cn.com.zte.zConnectManager.plist\n$ launchctl remove cn.com.zte.usbswapper.plist\n\nRun the following to see what cn.com.zte stuff is in launchctl:\n$ launchctl list | grep cn.com.zte\n\nIf the command returns nothing, then you should be okay, though the ZTE programs may figure out a way to reinsert themselves into launchctl.

The perfect example was one to bring the Terminal to the front. Some of these required selecting a menu item in the application brought to the front such as Bring All to Front.\nNow it seems you need to grant \"accessability\" to every single app so that a universal keystroke will work if the Service uses the System Events AppleScript library.\nAnyone know a fix for this?\n\nA: I don't know how to click menu items without using System Events, but if others get here searching for how to click menu items with System Events:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Finder\"\n    click menu item \"New Finder Window\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Finder\"\n    set frontmost to true\n    click (menu item 1 where its name starts with \"Compress\") of menu 1 of menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Finder\"\n    set frontmost to true\n    tell menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1\n        click\n        click menu item \"Open With\" of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nYou can allow all currently installed applications to use the accessibility API by dragging them to the list in System Preferences:\n\n", "Q: Mac OS X Server user can't change password I have non-admin users who need to change their password. The passwd command is apparently limited to administrators.\nOn the Server website, there's a change password link, but it doesn't work, and users receive an error. Internally, Mac OS X logs the following message:\nJan 21 01:56:02 domain.com collabd[247]: [CSAuthService.m:506 ab93000 +206ms] Could not change password for user 1234 with error Error Domain=com.apple.OpenDirectory Code=4001 \"Operation was denied because the current credentials do not have the appropriate privileges.\" UserInfo=0x1234567890abc {NSLocalizedDescription=Operation was denied because the current credentials do not have the appropriate privileges., NSLocalizedFailureReason=Operation was denied because the current credentials do not have the appropriate privileges.}\n\nI have the option in the website service checked to allow changing passwords. What would be causing this error?\nEDIT: Users created with the Server app are fine, but the trouble is with users created with dscl on the command line. Here are the exact commands used to create a test user named \"qwer\":\nsudo dscl . create /Users/qwer UniqueID 507\nsudo dscl . create /Users/qwer PrimaryGroupID 20\nsudo dscl . create /Users/qwer UserShell /bin/bash\nsudo dscl . create /Users/qwer NFSHomeDirectory /Users/qwer\nsudo mkdir /Users/qwer\nsudo chown qwer:staff /Users/qwer\nsudo passwd qwer\n\nI then executed sudo dscl . read /Users/qwer and compared it with sudo dscl . read /Users/uiop for a second test user.\nIn the records, the following keys are unique to the user created with the Server app:\ndsAttrTypeNative:_writers_hint\ndsAttrTypeNative:_writers_jpegphoto\ndsAttrTypeNative:_writers_passwd\ndsAttrTypeNative:_writers_picture\ndsAttrTypeNative:_writers_realname\ndsAttrTypeNative:_writers_UserCertificate\nLastName\nRealName\n\nThese match:\nAppleMetaNodeLocation\nPasswordPolicyOptions\nPrimaryGroupID\nRecordType\nUserShell\n\nAnd these are unique to each user (or in the case of Password are obfuscated):\ndsAttrTypeNative:KerberosKeys\ndsAttrTypeNative:ShadowHashData\nAuthenticationAuthority\nGeneratedUID\nGeneratedUID\nNFSHomeDirectory\nRecordName\nUniqueID\nPassword\n\nI checked AuthenticationAuthority but the only thing different is the username in the string, so that could be considered equivalent as well.\nAdditionally, groups qwer and groups uiop give exactly the same output.\nThere doesn't appear to be anything preventing \"qwer\" from changing their password except for the fact that their user account was created on the command line; however, the dscl method should be perfectly valid.\n\nA: According to this old article (10.3!), the lack of a _writers_password property in the NetInfo database would prevent users from changing their password.  That's really outdated, but it seems like a reasonable place to start.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TA21256\n(Edit)\nFrom some other sources (as far back as \"Running Mac OS X Tiger\" page 136) it looks like _writers_passwd is a list of users who can change that particular user's password.  So, setting it to the username should be sufficient.\n\nA: First, the passwd command doesn't require any administrator access to change your own password.\nI think you have a certificate problem. Have a look in the Certificate pane of the Server app and check that all your certificates are still valid and that there is no warning about a service not using a certificate in the bottom pane. It looks like the web server is not being allowed to make the password change for some reason.\nYou could also go to /Library/Server/Wiki/Config and run plutil on all the plist files to make sure nothing is too wrong there. I'd also check that all the file permissions look sane.\nDo you get the same error for both standard and admin users? Can an admin user successfully check into Profile Manager?\n", "Q: MacBook Air hot after sleeping I am experiencing strange issue with my MacBook Air (2011, with Mavericks):\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't like to turn off my machine, so I usually just close the lid and put my laptop to backpack before I go to sleep\n\n*I take it off the bag in the morning at the work, do only basic work (email etc. - no suspicious things in Activity Monitor), but my MacBook Air will get to high temperatures (90℃ for CPU, runs fan at 6000 RPM).\n\n\nI can 'solve' that by putting computer to sleep, wait a while (~30 sec), wake it up again and temperatures will get back to normal.

I have an iPod 5 but I want the front and back camera, so for my upcoming birthday in April I'm planning an upgrade.\nCan I use the same Apple ID and start at the same level on the Apps I have on this iPod?\n\nA: Simply create a backup, but sync all applications first to your PC else you have to do extra work. Syncing to iCloud is possible, but if you want to restore all your applications back on the new iPod it's much easier to make an iTunes backup as you can sync back all applications on the new iPod.\nIf you make the backup Encrypted, it will also save all your passwords etc, making setting up of the new device much easier.

It is triggered by an event in Calender through Open Application at time of event and then reaccesses another Calendar in the Calendar app to get the next meeting date. At the end it sends an email with both event dates. And everything works fine when I'm at the machine and the screen isn't locked.\nBut when the screen is locked, the app asks for permission to access the Calendar (which it does not when the screen isn't locked) and if I don't grant it, nothing happens of course.\nAnd if I then unlock the screen and go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy I see an app with a cryptic name (i.e. 737C530B-...D34B47.app) under the Calendar permissions tab. So this must be some kind of hashed name of my original app that I want to execute.\nSo, my question now is:  how can I permanently app my own AppleScript .app to the Calendar permission s.t.

If you don't erase the target volume from Disk Utility first, the Reinstall OS X option installs a new copy of OS X over the current installation. It should keep user files and settings in place, so it's not absolutely necessary to even have a backup. It fixed an issue I had where I was not able to start up in OS X.\nIf you don't already have backups, you can use Disk Utility to save a disk image to an external drive or copy files to an external drive in single user mode.\nI don't think it would help, but you can revert the changes to the launchd plists by running these commands in single user mode:\nsudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.coreservices.appleevents ExitTimeOut\nsudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.securityd ExitTimeOut\nsudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder ExitTimeOut\nsudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.diskarbitrationd ExitTimeOut\nsudo defaults delete /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.coreservices.appleid.authentication ExitTimeOut\n\n", "Q: how can i stop the thief from using my iPhone?

I am trying to implement the functionality that whenever a video is downloaded in my dropbox folder on my PC it is converted and put in another folder. Currently i am testing it with a test folder (not on dropbox so i am just copying files to it to test). When a put a single file or multiple files in the folder simultaneously it works. But when   i put one file (or many) and script is executing i.e. converting the videos and i put another file in the folder then for that new file script is never called so the new video is not converted.\nSo how can i achieve this functionality that when script is running and new file is added another instance of script is started for new file. \nAnd also the new file is saving with only the first word in the name if name has many words (i.e. breaking on space)\nHere is the screenshot of my automator configuration:\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\nHere is my script from run shell script as you asked @:Tony Williams\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    Applications/HandBrakeCLI -i \"$f\" -t 1 --angle 1 -c 1 -o \"/Users/abc/Desktop/TestVidDest/$(basename $f)\"  -f mp4  -4  -O  --decomb=\"fast\" -w 1280 -l 720 --modulus 16 -e x264 -b 3800 -2  -T  --cfr -a 1 -E faac -6 dpl2 -R 48 -B 128 -D 0 --gain 0 --audio-fallback ffac3 --x264-preset=slow  --x264-profile=high  --x264-tune=\"film\"  --h264-level=\"4.0\"  --verbose=1\ndone\n\n\nA: Process in the background\nIdeally, your script needs to complete as quickly as possible. The easiest way is to spin off the processing of the movies into background processes. You can do this by adding a space and an ampersand & to the end of your HandBrakeCLI line.\nMove before processing\nHowever, this does not solve the problem of new files being ignored. In fact, your files could now be processed twice if the processing is not finished before the next new file appears.\nYour script should move each new file to another unmonitored folder before processing begins. Consider adding a mv command before your HandBrakeCLI line. Alternatively, you could have Automator perform the move.\nThe destination folder should ideally be on the same drive, so it completes quickly and does not delay the script.\n\nA: I highly recommend Don Melton's (former Apple Safari chief) transcode-video script for converting video files. The topic and script are covered in depth on iMore's Vector podcast, episode 22.\nTo automate, the script could be wrapped in a Folder Action, or see Don's Gist comment (24 Jun) on how he does batch transcodes.\n\nA: Also keep in mind that there was/is HandBreakeBatch which like the name indicates is meant to do batch processing HandBreak.\nBut as the Developer says on its Website http://www.osomac.com/2013/08/08/handbrake-adds-real-batch-processing/\nHabdbreak now should Support Batch processing by them selfes.\n", "Q: Mavericks makes files synced to SMB share hidden I have a script running by a LaunchAgent to sync a directory with a remote share. \nThis script is fairly simple, I'll include it here just so nobody suspects the script. \n#!/bin/bash\n# Hjälpskript för att ta backup.\n# Endast för Mac OS, kommandon som stat, date och nc har annat syntax\n# på Linux.\n# Av Stefan Midjich\n\n# REDIGERA DEN HÄR SÖKVÄGEN\nbackupTarget='/Volumes/myuser'\n\n# REDIGERA ENDAST HÄR UNDER OM DU VET VAD DU GÖR\ndestinationFormat=\"sync\" # backar som standard till YYYY-MM kataloger, en för varje månad\nrsyncPort=22 # som standard antar vi att rsync använder ssh på port 22\npurge=0 # som standard rensas inget gammalt\npurgeDate='-2m' # standard: idag minus 2 månader\nhostPattern='^([^:]+):(\\/?.*)' # matcha värdnamn och sökväg från backupTarget\n\n# Avsluta direkt om mål-katalogen inte existerar\nif [[ ! \"$backupTarget\" =~ $hostPattern && ! -d \"$backupTarget\" ]]; then\n    echo \"Backup target looks like directory that is not found\" 1>&2\n    exit 1;\nelif [ -n \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\" ]; then\n    # Här har vi hittat vad som ser ut att vara ett värdnamn i backupTarget.\n    # Så vi ska kontrollera att värden går att kontakta.\n    remoteHost=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\n    if ! nc -z -w 5 \"$remoteHost\" $rsyncPort >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n            echo \"Can't connect to target host on port $rsyncPort\" 1>&2\n            exit 1\n    fi\nfi\n\n# Ta backup av samtliga argument som är\n# existerande kataloger.\nfor syncDir in $@; do\n    if [ -d \"$syncDir\" ]; then\n            # Lägg till --delete efter -a om rsync även ska radera i\n            # destinationskatalogen.

In the Apple TV, when enabling AirPlay it shows \"step 1: connect to a wifi network\".\nWhat if I have Ethernet? Bluetooth?\nWill only WiFi work?\n\nA: \nTo switch back to a wired connection, connect the Ethernet cable.\n  Apple TV will switch to the wired connection automatically. Apple TV\n  prioritizes a wired Ethernet connection.\n\nAccording to Apple\n\nA: If you turn on the ATV's \"Conference Room Display\" mode (and your ATV is connected via Wi-Fi), ATV shows this text with the screensaver:\n\nAirPlay\nWirelessly send what's on your iOS device or computer to this\n  display using AirPlay.  To learn more, go to apple.com/airplay.\n1 Choose Wi-Fi Network (insert name of your network here)\n2 Choose this Apple TV (insert name of your ATV here)\n\nBased on this, it correctly explains that you can send content from iOS to ATV over Wi-Fi.  It incorrectly implies that you can ONLY send content from a computer over wi-fi.  This isn't true.  My Mac is connected to my router via Ethernet, and the router connects to ATV over wi-fi.  So, I don't actually have to do step #1 (select the wi-fi network) on my Mac, but I do need to do that on iOS.\nIf your ATV was connected via Ethernet, I'm sure you'd get a similar message, although it might not explicitly state which wi-fi network to use on your iOS device, since the ATV itself wouldn't be connected via wi-fi.\nAs long as your iOS's wi-fi network was connected to the ATV's Ethernet network \"locally\", it will still work.  In a complex network, like in large corporation/office environment, you might not be able to get from the iOS's wi-fi to the ATV's Ethernet thru AirPlay, which might not auto-detect AirPlay devices through the various switches/routers/etc.  But, in most home networks, you should be all set!\n\nA: There is another workaround, if your ATV is latest version 6.1 software updated, and iOS devices 7.1 updated, enabling Bluetooth on both ATV and iOS devices will solve this problem. \nIt is enabled by Bonjour over Bluetooth functionality. Then if all devices are on same network (or even if on different subnets but routable subnets) will function Airplay even if ATV is on ethernet and iOS devices are on WiFi.\nThanks to this information http://www.afp548.com/2014/03/10/hidden-airplay-feature-in-the-appletv-6-1-ios-7-1-update/\n\nA: Airplay won't work if ATV is connected via ethernet, and iOS-OSX devices are connected via wifi even if they are on the same network.\nDisabling IPv6 on OSX devices works around this problem. But since it is not possible to do this trick on iOS devices, the only solution seems to be ATV to be connected via wifi.\nThis limitation only applies for AirPlay. Other functionality of ATV will work the same way (i.e. sahe an iTunes library etc.) even if the ATV is connected via ethernet and other iOS-OSX devices are either on ethernet or wifi.\n", "Q: Safari 7 can't connect to intranet using HTTP authentication See the UPDATE below for new information about the actual HTTP requests going on under the hood.\nSo I started a new job back in October.

It's not just sitting there; Safari is actually requesting the page almost 1000 times per second, and each time, it gets a 401 error and an HTML error page with the title \"You are not authorized to view this page\".\nOn one example request from the middle of a load attempt, Safari sends this Authorization header:\nNegotiate YEgGBisGAQUFAqA+MDygDjAMBgorBgEEAYI3AgIKoioEKE5UTE1TU1AAAQAAAAUCiGIAAAAAGAAAAAAAAAAYAAAABgGwHQ8AAAA=\n\nAnd the server responds with this WWW-Authenticate header:\nNegotiate oYIBIzCCAR+gAwoBAaEMBgorBgEEAYI3AgIKooIBCASCAQROVExNU1NQAAIAAAAOAA4AOAAAAAUCiWKPhp0o8/Y/9gAAAAAAAAAAvgC+AEYAAAAFAs4OAAAAD0EAUgBJAFMAVwBFAEIAAgAOAEEAUgBJAFMAVwBFAEIAAQAMAE4ARQBXAFcARQBCAAQAKgBhAHIAaQBzAHcAZQBiAC4AYQByAGkAcwB0AG8AdABsAGUALgBuAGUAdAADADgATgBFAFcAVwBFAEIALgBhAHIAaQBzAHcAZQBiAC4AYQByAGkAcwB0AG8AdABsAGUALgBuAGUAdAAFACoAYQByAGkAcwB3AGUAYgAuAGEAcgBpAHMAdABvAHQAbABlAC4AbgBlAHQAAAAAAA==\n\nOn the next request, Safari sends an identical Authorization header, and then the server responds with a very slightly different WWW-Authenticate header:\nNegotiate oYIBIzCCAR+gAwoBAaEMBgorBgEEAYI3AgIKooIBCASCAQROVExNU1NQAAIAAAAOAA4AOAAAAAUCiWLa6vytPOG0owAAAAAAAAAAvgC+AEYAAAAFAs4OAAAAD0EAUgBJAFMAVwBFAEIAAgAOAEEAUgBJAFMAVwBFAEIAAQAMAE4ARQBXAFcARQBCAAQAKgBhAHIAaQBzAHcAZQBiAC4AYQByAGkAcwB0AG8AdABsAGUALgBuAGUAdAADADgATgBFAFcAVwBFAEIALgBhAHIAaQBzAHcAZQBiAC4AYQByAGkAcwB0AG8AdABsAGUALgBuAGUAdAAFACoAYQByAGkAcwB3AGUAYgAuAGEAcgBpAHMAdABvAHQAbABlAC4AbgBlAHQAAAAAAA==\n\nRepeat ad infinitum.\n\nI've tried deleting everything that matches intranet in Keychain Access and clearing my entire cache/cookies, to see if I could restore the original weird behavior, but it didn't work.\nDo I have some kind of funky domain stuff going on? What else can I try to diagnose this?\n\nA: I can confirm that I see the identical problem with Safari 7.0.2 (9537.74.9), with all current Mac OS X Mavericks updates installed. (Thousands of request packets per second with the same kind of content as described above.)\nHowever, while this may or may not help the original poster, I have found that this problem only occurs if the Windows server has Integrated Windows Authentication (also known as NTLM Authentication) and Negotiate Authentication enabled.\nThe server then sends these two headers:\nWWW-Authenticate: Negotiate\nWWW-Authenticate: NTLM\n\nSafari will reply:\nAuthorization: Negotiate YEgGBisGAQUFAqA+MDygDjAMBgorBgEEAYI3AgIKoioEKE5UTE1TU1AAAQAAAAUCiGIAAAAAGAAAAAAAAAAYAAAABgGwHQ8AAAA=\n\nAnd from there, the loop will get going.\nBut if Negotiate Authentication is not enabled on the server, there will be only one WWW-Authenticate header:\nWWW-Authenticate: NTLM\n\nAnd Safari's reply will be something like:\nAuthorization: NTLM TlRMTVNTUAABAAAAB4IIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\n\nThis will work just fine. Essentially, it seems that Negotiate is broken in Safari, and since the server sends Negotiate first, indicating a preference for it, Safari will try it and enter an infinite loop that prevents it from falling back to NTLM.\nSo, if the server administrator can be persuaded to turn off Negotiate in the authentication settings, the problem may be solved.\nI might add that Firefox sends the \"Authorization: NTLM ...\" header regardless of whether the server provides Negotiate in addition to NTLM or not. Presumably, Negotiate is not implemented in Firefox.\n\nUpdate\nSafari 7.0.3 (9537.75.14) still exhibits the same problem.\nWe previously reported the issue as a bug at bugreport.apple.com, but the bug was closed as a duplicate of a previous bug—the contents of which we cannot see, except that it is still marked as open.\nUpdate 2\nI can confirm hauns's finding that the authentication works with Safari 7.0.4 (9537.76.4).\nUpdate 3\nThis issue is back in Safari 7.0.5 (9537.77.4)\nUpdate 4\nThis issue is still present in Safari 7.0.6 (9537.78.2), as noted by hauns, with cifs or smb volumes mounted.\n\nA: Safari 7.0.5 still has the issue: authentication breaks down if finder shares network resources via SMB: (or CIFS:). once all connected network volumes are unmounted, Safari resumes proper authentication.\nRegression:\n\n*\n\n*present in Yosemite 10.10.1/Safari 8.0.2\n\n*present in El Capitan 10.11.2/Safari 9.0.2\n\n*present in Safari 10.0.1\n\nThe corresponding Apple bug 22990203 is still active. No mortal is allowed to see it (cf.bugreporter.apple.com)\nSee also: https://discussions.apple.com/message/27727310#27727310\n\nA: We are having the same issue.  Thus why we haven't upgraded our Macs to Mavericks yet.  It appears to try to log into the Intranet without domain credentials(Intranet\\'blank').  It should be using the domain\\username.  I can understand this can be frustrating but it seems that authentication is missing in safari.\nI just a few seconds it will blow away logs.\nFirefox seems to work great though.\n\nA: This might be a long shot, but if you have a Kerberos ticket (from signing into another service), Safari might be trying to use that.\nOpen /System/Library/CoreServices/Ticket Viewer.app to see if you have any Kerberos tickets. If so, click on the ticket, Remove Identity, and try again.\nAlternatively, if nothing is listed, try using Add Identity and seeing if that works with Safari.\nFirefox and Chrome don't utilize Kerberos, I don't think, which is why they'll prompt you separately for credentials.\n\nA: Keychains was a good idea but you didn't quite go far enough.\nIn Safari if you look under the Safari menu you will see Reset Safari... Select this and a number of caches will be cleared.\nNow open Safari > Preferences > Autofill and turn off User names and passwords. Now select Passwords and remove any passwords listed there. Select Privacy and click on Remove All Website Data. Select Extensions and if you have any extensions installed switch extensions to Off.\nNow go and try your website. Once you've made the attempt go and have a look at Privacy to see if any cookies have been left and Passwords to see if Safari saved your password.\nThis might get you closer to a solution. Tell us how it goes after that. If Chrome works I'd love to know exactly what it's doing that works. Could a bit more snooping be required?\nJust for giggles try the URL http://username:password@intranet.example.com/ (replacing bits obviously) and see what happens.\n\nA: I had a similar issue at my office as well. The key was to make sure that my DNS lookup excluded the local (company/intranet) sites from going out to look for a DNS address. That was cause of my system wanting to go out to the proxy and getting the constant log in screen. What was happening is that my request for the url of intranet.company.com was being taken by the proxy server and sent out to the web. The main webserver would see that I was connecting through a company IP and respond looking for credentials that were stripped off by the proxy... I think.\nBasically making sure that the intranet site was not being sent to a proxy solved my issue. That plus just making Chrome my default browser...\n\nA: Use the Ticket Viewer.app, /System/Library/CoreServices/Ticket Viewer.app, and add a new ticket.\nIn the new ticket, use the username and password for the authentication of intranet url.\n\nA: This may or may not help but I have found that if I connect to an smb share other than myself I lose the Authentication Window in Safari 7.0.3 running OS 10.9.2\nMyself as in my active directory login and password. I am bound to an active directory server.\nI have not tested this on a non bound machine. I have also tested Chrome and FireFox and these apps have no problem wither way. Aurora does not work either way anymore.\nEdit by another user:\nThis appears to be the cause of the problem. This has now been tested with a non-bound machine running Mavericks and now running Yosemite.  After I connect to SMB shares, Safari will no longer present the authentication dialog.  In Mavericks, as soon as I disconnect from the SMB shares, the dialog is presented and I can log in to my company's Sharepoint 2013 intranet site.  I have no problem on Sharepoint 2007 or other intranet sites.\nIn Yosemite, it appears that I can connect to a maximum of two SMB shares and Safari will still work. If I am connected to three or more SMB shares, the problem manifests.  I am not sure yet if it is the number of shares or if perhaps the different shares have different permissions that might affect the situation.  I need to do some more rigorous testing on that front.\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a new user on the Mac.\n\n*Switch to this new user. You may do this while keeping your current session open.\n\n*Launch Safari. This is a virgin Safari.\n\n*Try to connect to the site. Normally, you will get the authentication dialog.\n\n", "Q: How to use 2009-era Airport Extreme in Bridge Mode Wifi I have a 2009-era Airport Extreme that used to provide routing and WiFi for our cablemodem. Time Warner updated our cablemodem to a DG860, which comes with its own built-in WiFi. \nI'd like to re-purpose the Airport Extreme as a WiFi bridge. Specifically, I'd like to be able to plug my wired ethernet devices (e.g. a printer in the basement) into a LAN port on the Airport Extreme, and have it bridge to the Time Warner WiFi network.\nWhen I attempt this in Airport Utility the most logical option seems to be \"Add to an existing network\", but it seems to expect to be physically plugged into the network. I.e. it wants to be plugged into the other router:\n\nIs there a way to bridge the Airport Extreme over WiFi?\n\nA: What you are describing is a WiFi extender. EG extending your Wifi network over WiFi. The basic two things you need to know are:\n\n\n*\n\n*No this Airport won't do that. I don't believe any will.\n\n*WiFi repeaters just (usually) don't work very well.\n\n\nTheWirecutter.com has a good take on it AND recommendations here http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wi-fi-extender/.\n\nA: You can extend a wireless network on an Airport Extreme, however it MAY require the old version of Airport Utility to accomplish these steps.\nWhat you would do is under \"Airport\", \"Wireless\" change \"Wireless Mode\" from \"Create a Wireless Network\" to \"Extend a Wireless Network\".  Then under \"Internet Connection\" set \"Connection Sharing\" from \"Distribute a Range of IP's\" to \"OFF-Bridge Mode\". Make sure it sees the network it needs to extend and that's it your done.\nYou can follow Apple's own K-Base docs for these steps here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4259\n", "Q: Can I force Safari on iOS to store a password, though the site disallows it? For OS X Safari there is a solution to force storing of passwords. Some sites disallow the storing of passwords, and I wonder if I can force this, at least for some sites, on Safari on iOS 7. \n\nA: Actually, it seems you can do this! I just found the settings under Safari->Passwords and auto-fill. The setting is called \"always allow\".\n\n\nA: No, this is not possible. Safari on iOS can't run extensions, and therefore functionality such as this can't be changed.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html\n\nA: No to go around the question but you could always try a third party browser.

Is there a way to stream audio to my Mac so that I can play audio on my Android device through my Mac's speakers?\n\nA: After 6 years, I finally found a solution. Use sndcpy with ADB over TCP.\nEnsure that you have USB Debugging on and Install via USB on.\nIf vlc is not found even though you installed VLC Media Player, then you can set an environment variable in your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc by adding a new line:\nexport VLC=\"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC\"\n\nIf you encounter this exception:\njava.lang.SecurityException: You need the android.permission.INSTALL_GRANT_RUNTIME_PERMISSIONS permission to use the PackageManager.INSTALL_GRANT_RUNTIME_PERMISSIONS flag\n\nthen open sndcpy bash script in a code editor and remove the -g flag from the two adb install commands.\n\nA: The easiest way is not to use Bluetooth but Wi-Fi nowadays, although it is not explained anywhere.\nConnect to the same Wi-Fi network your Mac is connected to.\nFirst one needs to download the AirServer Mac app which is not free.

You can only block up to 1 day. Unlike programs like stayfocusd, and cold turkey, which allow you to properly schedule blocking times, I might advise you to just switch to using chrome again, there seem to be more well developed programs for that, unfortunately\n\nA: Blocker for Facebook is available for Safari: https://extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.devankuleindiren.blockerforfacebook-ZRQ35C78DB\nIt creates a button that, upon clicking, asks you for how many minutes you'd like to block Facebook.

You can also set them to the \"more space mode\", and with 3rd party tools you can go native (much higher)!\nBut what I want to know is, how does \"upping\" the res affect the performance of the mac, in particular how does going beyond the retina option affect:\n\n\n*\n\n*The CPU\n\n*The GPU\n\n*IO?\n\n*RAM (I imagine there is no effect here?)\n\n*Battery life (I imagine this depends on how much the CPU/GPU is affected?)\n\n\nAnd if any of these are affected, is the relationship 1:1, or exponential, or what?\n\nA: From personal experience, the resolution has little impact of the 5 aspects listed. However, for me, there's a 6th and this seems to be affected quite a lot. Namely myself. I find that tiny fonts will make my eyes squint and I need to use more brainpower to read StackExchange questions, leaving a little less available to understand some of the remarkable comments left below the question (especially since the font is even smaller for those). My own battery life is severely degraded and I think I'll need to hit the sack in an hour or so.

When I ssh into a server, I am prompted for the password to unlock the key:\n\nI like this. I also like that I can ssh again and again and it doesn't prompt me for my password.\nWhat I don't like is that I am not required to enter my key password days or even weeks later. I can lock my screen or put it to sleep and I still don't have to enter my key password. The only time it seems to expire the password is when I logout (which I do rarely).\nHow do I get the key password to expire after a while, forcing me to enter my password again to authenticate? Making it so that perhaps after 1 hour, the key is automatically forgotten.\n\nA: Note: in newer versions of OS X you must disable System Integrity Protection for this answer to work. (Thanks to @Dave Gregory and @Jaap for pointing this out.)\nOpen /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openssh.ssh-agent.plist (in older versions: org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist) in a text editor. Replace:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/usr/bin/ssh-agent</string>\n    <string>-l</string>\n</array>\n\nwith:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/usr/bin/ssh-agent</string>\n    <string>-l</string>\n    <string>-t</string>\n    <string>30m</string>\n</array>\n\nThis will expire the key after 30 minutes.\nReboot. Wait, reboot?!? This isn't Windows! Yes, reboot.\nWell, you can try to decipher the instructions for changing the setting on the fly, but good luck.\n\nA: You need to set the life of the key. It ordinarily defaults to forever.\nWhen you run ssh-add you want to use the -t option. If you want a key life of one hour then it is ssh-add -t 1h. The time formats can be seen in the sshd_config man page but put simply they are a number followed by s, m, h, d, or w for seconds, minutes, hours, days or weeks.\nssh-add can be put into your .bashrc file and it will just ask you to validate the key once. Even when the key \"expires\" it isn't removed - it just asks for the passphrase again when an attempt is made to use it.\nThe other option would be to alter the launch options for ssh-agent which are stored in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist and add the -t there. (I use LaunchControl for changing these but you can do it by hand if you are careful.)\n\nA: Rather than tweaking ssh-agent (which now requires silly amounts of hacking), I strongly recommend simply changing the settings on your default (login) keychain. I use the very helpful 'lock on sleep' as well as 'lock after 4 hours' because I don't want prompts unless I'm actually afk.\nOpen Keychain Access and right-click the login keychain to change settings:\n\nOr if you prefer a commandline:\nsecurity set-keychain-settings -lu -t 14400\n\nThis will result in at least one extra prompt for unlocking the keychain itself (requiring your login password) as well as the prompt for whichever key you're trying to use... but it beats disabling System Integrity Protection IMO.\n\nA: An other solution is:\nssh-add -t <time> <ssh-private-key>  # Set maximum lifetime to your SSH priv key.\nkillall ssh-agent                    # Kill all ssh-agent processes.\nssh-add -D                           # Delete all identities recorded by the agent.\n\nWith this solution, you do not have to choose a timeout to all your keychain - quite annoying when you want to set a timeout of some seconds to your private key password recording - and you do not have to disable your SIP to edit /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist.\n", "Q: iPhone / iPad: Reply to Email with embedded image -- Image gets replaced with image.png Here is the case:\n\n\n*\n\n*User Receives an email with and embedded image in the body of the email.\n\n*replies to the email and the embedded image gets removed from the body. \n\n*forwards the email.. its fine the image is retained in the body.\ndoes anyone know of any work around for this. this only happens when working from mobile device (iphone or ipad) using iOS 7 mobile mail. \nReplies from outlook retains the image. We have exchange 2010 on the backend using activesync to connect devices.\nCan reply be made to work like forward ?\n\nA: This is default behaviour. If you reply, the sender already had the image thus it's not needed to send it over and over again.\nIf you forward it, you're (most likely) sending it to a different person who did never see the content before, which makes it relevant to add the image.\nYou cannot change this, except if you find any 3rd party plugin.\nIf you really want to reply the image, just forward the mail and add the emailaddress of the sender back in the \"To\" field.\n\nA: First try to forward and click on Include Images.

I think the problem is coming from the GPU (Nividia 320m). One solution could be to change the thermal paste on the GPU but before doing this I want to know the temperature of the GPU.\nI use iStat Pro but it doesn't propose to measure this temperature. Do you know if it's possible? And if yes how can I do this?\n\nA: I used to have an MBP 15\" mid-2010 and I was able to measure a lot of temperatures (including, I'm fairly sure, the GPU temperature) using iStat Menus. They have a 14-day trial version so it costs nothing to try.\nEdit: here's a crop from a screenshot on my older MBP 15\" mid-2010 showing the latest version of iStat Menus.

I'm about to put my old MBP up for sale, so I re-installed from the recovery partition after wiping the drive. But when I rebooted from the recovery partition to double-check I'd deleted everything, it connected to my wifi network. I've got two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I remove my network credentials from the recovery partition?\n\n*What other personal information is it storing without my knowledge, and how do I wipe it?\n\n\nA: The answer was indeed to reset the NVRAM by holding cmd-alt-p-r during boot. Cheers :)\n\nA: In recent versions of macOS, the installer will boot into the setup which copies the NVRAM Wi-Fi credentials to a preferences file. Then, even if you clear the NVRAM, on the next boot, the OS will copy the Wi-Fi credentials back to the NVRAM.\nTo get around this:\n\n*\n\n*After installation, shut down by pressing Cmd-Q\n\n*Boot into recovery mode (hold Cmd-R during boot)\n\n*Open the Terminal from Utilities menu > Terminal\n\n*Remove the wi-fi preferences (assuming your volume is named Macintosh HD:\ncd '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/'\n# For 10.15 and earlier:\nrm com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n# For 11.x (Big Sur) and later:\nrm com.apple.wifi.known-networks.plist\n\n\n\n*Clear the nvram variables:\nnvram -d current-network\nnvram -d preferred-networks\nnvram -d preferred-count\n\n\n\n*Reboot the computer into setup assistant.

I am looking to implement a fully automated solution that will pick video files from an incoming directory, process them and put the result to iTunes special \"Automatically Add to iTunes\" directory.\nBefore starting to propose different products do read the requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command line interface, so we can use it with a cron\n\n*Do Pass Thru for video and audio streams if the source is already compatible with target format\n\n*Download subtitles from an external service (optional)\n\n*Embedding existing SRT files into the output video\n\n*Fixing metadata from an external service (optional)\n\n\nInitially I would say that Handbrake should be able to do this, but I discovered that handbrake will never do Pass Thru for video (that's a statement that I got from the author).\n\nA: z264\nz264 will look at every file, but will only touch avi, flv, mpg, mpeg, wmv, vob, mkv and mp4 video files, copying video and audio streams and rewrapping if possible, transcoding just the audio if necessary, and transcoding only what video is necessary, and leave you with iTunes friendly, atom optimized mp4 files, leaving the originals in your Trash. It makes reasonably intelligent decisions for you about how to transcode files based on how you set its HandBrake variables (set at lines 312-333).\n\ncheck file for AVC encoding and flv, wmv, or mkv wrapper and rewrap in mp4 container otherwise, if not already am mp4, transcode to AVC mp4\nz264 has several dependencies (mediainfo, rmtrash, ffmpeg, SublerCLI, and HandBrakeCLI)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*copy and paste binary install section into a new bash script and use it to download and install the dependencies into /usr/local/bin/ (create /usr/local and /usr/local/bin/ if not there already)\n\n*create 2GB ramdisk called 'Two' using command in ramdisk section\ndiskutil quiet erasevolume HFS+ 'Two' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://4194304`\n\n\n*double-check command definitions (locations of dependencies), and correct locations (to \"/usr/local/bin/\")\nchange line 231 to read:  mediainfo=\"/usr/local/bin/mediainfo\"\nchange line 236 to read:  rmtrash=\"/usr/local/bin/rmtrash\"\nchange line 238 to read:  ffmpeg=\"/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg\"\nchange line 239 to read:  SublerCLI=\"/usr/local/bin/SublerCLI\"\nchange line 262 to read:  mediainfo=\"/usr/local/bin/mediainfo\"\nchange line 263 to read:  rmtrash=\"/usr/local/bin/rmtrash\"\nchange line 265 to read:  HandBrakeCLI=\"/usr/local/bin/HandBrakeCLI\"\n\n\n*save as z264 in /usr/local/bin/\n\n*make executable\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/z264\n\n*use Terminal to call z264 on single file, directory of files, or call it from a cron to crawl entire file systems periodically\nz264 directory.full.of.mixed.video.filetypes/*\n\n\nminor issues: user needs to be able to read, debug, and use bash. z264 does not yet count how many background_transcoder processes it spawns, meaning if there are a lot of transcodes, it will take awhile for them to complete, but they will complete. You also need a lot of memory (8GB is ok). Snow Leopard users will need to install purge command from xcode developer tools. \n\nA: Currently I use Subler to convert MKVs to MP4s and embed subtitles in the process, without transcoding either video or audio. If I need to transcode DTS so that Apple TV will play it, I use MP4Tools. However, both of these are GUIs, and I have no idea if they can be called from the command-line. I suppose your best bet would be MKVToolNix (assuming you just want to change the format) and ffmpeg (which includes transcoding options for when they're needed).\n\nA: I'm using HandBrake as suggested in the Question above if the download isn't in MP4 format available. (I think I cannot name the service I'm using as downloading isn't legal in every country, but searching for Keyword \"YIFY\" might help to find MP4 rips)\nNext to that I'm using Subler to add an SRT without having to convert the MP4 all over again. \nAnd afterwards to get the meta-data and the copy to iTunes I'm using iFlicks which can be downloaded from the App Store.\n\nA: I think you'll find your answers in those two posts: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/123658/3301\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/a/17584272/364446\nSo, to sum it up: \nffmpeg -i <input_file>.mkv -f srt -i <input_subtitle>.srt -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 384k -c:s mov_text -strict -2 <output_file>.mp4\n\n\nA: Try in the package ffmpeg.

If you type / you can search through the file for cd (notice the space) and see if that is happening.\nOnce you have discovered that \"someone\" - in your case rvm - is defining a shell function called cd then you can either uninstall the culprit or find where it does the nasty work and change the name of the function to something like 'rcd' instead of 'cd'. As the shell function is listed first in the output of type the builtin cd is ignored except where it is getting called by the function (that's what the builtin cd in the function definition is doing - calling the builtin version).\nI'd almost guarantee that the function is defined in /Users/user/.rvm/scripts/rvm.\nI'd start by uninstalling rvm and then reinstall to see if that fixes it.

Has this improved for Mavericks?\n\nA: Try the right option key+click\nThis works for me using parallels with Windows 8.1, I haven’t personally come across web apps that use this, so I can't test this.\nRight click actually emulates control+click due to the history of apple sticking with a single button mouse for so long, thus the context menu used the control click method, plus Mac OS X doesn’t have a context key on the keyboard like Windows Keyboards (located on the right side of the main keyboard, in-between the control and alt (alt GR) or windows keys).\n\nA: I found that I can use Option+Command in lieu of Control when using online Flash training applications (I'm using 10.8.5 Mountain Lion).\n\nA: BetterTouchTool allows ctrl-click remapping.\nThere is an example of ctrl-click to alt-space remapping for IDEA.\n\n\nA: Option+Command+LeftClick, recommended by mvreijn for VMware Windows 7 guests, works quite nicely in Citrix connections to Windows 7 machines.\n\nA: There is no system supported method for disabling ctrl+click from functioning as a secondary click in Mavericks.\nYou can use Karabiner Elements to remap \"Control+LeftClick to LeftClick,\" which essentially disables this behavior system-wide.\n\nStep 1:\nInstall Karabiner Elements:\nhttps://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/\n\nStep 2:\nWhen you then go to open Karabiner Elements, it will have a couple security issues you need to resolve.\nThe first will be to allow the installation of a kernel extension:\n\nThe second will be to allow input monitoring:\n\n\nStep 3:\nOnce those security issues are handled, you then need to add a complex modification.

Also, it sounds like you made your own fusion drive instead of buying an officially supported configuration so it could be that OS X just doesn't support doing this with your drives.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the state of Core Storage to see if things look correct on the logical disk level.  In Terminal, type: diskutil cs list\n\n*Assuming everything is Online and good, you should scan the logical volume for errors.  In Disk Utility, select your logical volume and \"Verify Disk\" followed by \"Verify Disk Permissions\".  You might have a few disk permission errors which probably aren't your issue but you should watch out for disk errors thrown by Verify Disk.\n\n*[Read completely before typing any commands. I am not liable for your data loss]  Assuming everything checks out, then there is probably a hardware issue with one of the individual disks in the pair.  Open Terminal and type diskutil list to list out the individual drives in your machine.  You need to identify the actual hardware drives and not the logical drives that are created as part of Fusion or any encryption in use.  It should be something like /dev/disk0 and /dev/disk1.  Once you have identified your actual physical drives, you can try forcing a read of every sector on each drive to cause bad sectors to be remapped if one of your drives is failing.  In Terminal type sudo dd if=/dev/rdisk0 of=/dev/null bs=64k.  This will ask you for your password.  Note the 'r' in front of rdisk0.  Also, replace the number after rdisk with the numbers you determined earlier for your physical disks.  This will take a long time.  It will read every single part of your hard drive and send the data that it reads to nowhere since we don't care about interpreting what is being read and just want it to be accessed.  If sectors on the drive are bad, then they will balk when they are read and the drive should internally remap the bad locations to a reserved set of new ones.  Once you have done this for both drives, the drives should stop having read/write errors assuming there was a small section that was bad on one of the drives which was able to be remapped.  WARNING.  Typing the previous sudo command incorrectly could erase your computer.  Also, if one of your hard drives is failing and about to die, then forcing a complete read of the hard drive could cause too many bad sectors to be remapped and cause your drive to fail.  Ideally you backup all data before doing this.  Also, even better would be to read the SMART tables off of each drive and look at the reallocated sector count.  The number should be 0.  Unfortunately, I don't know if an OS X utility will let you do this while your drives are combined using Fusion.  You might have to pull them out and test on a different machine.  A non-zero reallocated sector count means the drive is already failing and forcing a full read may kill the drive or may revive it if the damage is minor.  Ideally you would perform a full wipe of the drive instead of doing a read since this is much better at flushing out bad sectors but that would also erase all of the data on your drive.\n\n*If the previous suggestion didn't work or is too scary, then don't use Fusion in an unsupported configuration.\n\n", "Q: How do I stop my Excel spreadsheets from opening when starting my IMac and also the first time I open Excel?

The iPad is also connected to a WiFi network which does not have internet access.  The iPad won't connect to the internet until I turn WiFi off, so I presume it's prioritizing the WiFi.  How can I reverse this priority?\n\nA: I am guessing that the problem might be related to the DHCP server on the WiFi network, telling your iPad to use a 'default router' on its network.\nIf the DHCP server sends a value for the 'default router', then the iPad (or any computer, for that matter) will use that router address for all traffic that is not within any of the subnets to which it is attached. This is expected behaviour.\nIf you have access to the DHCP server's settings, try telling it not to give clients a 'default router', and the problem should go away.\nAnother suggestion is to turn off DHCP in the WiFi settings on the iPad, and allocate yourself a static address. Again, it helps if you are involved with network administration here, as otherwise you might allocate yourself an address that is already in use, and badness will ensue. But you could allocate yourself an address, a subnet mask and DNS server(s) - and do NOT set a 'router' address.\n", "Q: Random and brief fan spin up I occasionally leave my Mac mini on but with its screens off, the way my power settings is  set.. the Mac should go into sleep mode after 15 minutes of inactivity.\nI noticed tonight that this did not happen, and randomly an hour later the Macs fan started to spin up aggressively for a very brief period (5 seconds).\nCould anyone tell me what this could be?

To get the picture to appear I have to turn off screen sharing. Only then can we watch the movie. \nHow can I continue to use screen sharing and view DVD's.  \n\nA: This is a silly copy protection measure. If you use VLC rather than Apple's DVD Player you get no problem at all.\nFirst, go to System Preferences > CDs & DVDs and change the setting for When You Insert a Video DVD from DVD Player to Ignore or choose other and select VLC 2 in your Applications folder.\nNow when you insert a DVD VLC 2 will run and should autostart.

I just got a new iPhone 5S a week ago. Works perfectly aside from the fact that the battery tends to act weirdly. As mentioned in the title, when I remove the charger the battery percentage drop by a single percent, sometimes instantly and sometimes after a few minutes.\nHowever, if I reboot my phone the percentage goes back up to 100% and stays there for a more normal amount of time. Not the biggest issue in the world, but still, annoying :)\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I've found this on the Apple Site, this is for Macbooks. \nIn short it tells this about the battery:\n\nOccasionally, the battery may not show a full charge (100%) in OS X, even after the power adapter has been connected for an extended period of time. The battery may appear to stop charging between 93 percent and 99 percent. This behavior is normal and will help to prolong the overall life of the battery.\n\nHowever, I'm 100% sure I've read the same about an iPhone.\nI don't know if you have ever jailbroken your device, but there was a tool in the past to display the real battery percentage. This is maybe why after a restore you see 100%, as Apple is a bit creative in showing the real values.\nEDIT: The application I was talking about above is SBSettings/Mobile Substrate. I do not know if these work in iOS7. Nor am I responsible for these applications.\n\nA: Battery level indications are notoriously unreliable in most devices. That's why it's known as the indicator rather than the gauge, as the latter implies accuracy (same goes for car fuel tanks, which is why when there is less than approximately 30 miles of fuel left, my car then stops telling me the level and just says \"Refuel!!\"). It's very common to note unusual behaviour such as you describe, and other similar behaviour like the first 50% being used slower than the last 50%, etc.\nIn an attempt to improve the situation, Apple did something a little different with how the battery indicator value is commonly generated in iOS. But before I mention that, it's worth showing how a lot of other manufacturers do it (and indeed how Apple does it on OSX hardware still).\nThe normal method is to show 100% full when the battery stops charging. This is a physical measure, rather than a logical one, and relies on taking voltage/ampage readings and whether they have stopped increasing or reached expected levels, etc. On a Macbook, the behaviour shown by @Robuust' answer is because of this method of charging; because it's not good to keep topping up the battery to absolutely full when it has only lost a percent or so - it's better to use a bit more before starting to charge again. OSX won't bother charging a battery that was at 100% until it has dropped sufficiently to make charging it back up worth it without causing potential battery health issues. As such, if you unplug to walk to another room and drop from 100% to 98%, it will determine that it's not worth the potential shortening of a batteries long term life just to give you a 2% recharge. It will wait until a lower indication is reached, say 94%, and then when it drops below this threshold start to charge again.\nThis causes (or used to cause) endless user confusion; Why doesn't my battery get to 100%?!?! My battery is faulty...\nSo in iOS, they switched to a different method of reporting battery life. The genuine 100% charge state is still monitored in the same way, but the way it is reported to the user is different. The battery will show as full when in reality it's only, for example, say 95% full (I don't know the exacts, which probably changes model to model anyway). At this point you can safely unplug and use the device (there is no need to charge a modern battery all the way to prevent memory damage) although it might not be fully charged regardless of what it says. If you leave it plugged in however, it continues to charge. Physically as the battery reaches 100% charge, logically that is essentially going over the 100% level shown to the user, say to 105% (although this isn't shown, clearly). At the point that it reaches this genuine full mark it then runs on battery until the value is lowered back to 95% physical/100% logical. Then it charges up. It will use the top 5% or so of genuine physical battery charge to constantly run the battery through a small charge/discharge cycle, and display 100% at all times to the user, regardless of where it is in the cycle.\nActual physical battery capacity:\n[0--------------------------------------------------100]\nLogical user reported charge:\n[--0---------------------------------------------100---] \nLogical user accessible charge:\n[--0------------------------------------------------105] \nKeeping a battery active in this way is better for its health than charging it to full and keeping in charged to full. Batteries are designed to be used, which is why laptop batteries on machines that commonly stay plugged in often fail with relatively little use - you should use the battery regularly to keep it healthy.\nA net result of the above operation is that sometimes when your phone is showing 100% it will drop to 99 relatively quickly, because it was at that point in the cycle where it had been running on battery and was about to start charging again anyway. Other times when you unplug, it has just finished charging to its genuine full charge, and therefore you get all the extra time it takes to discharge down from its logical 105% down to 99%, so it will show at 100% for ages before starting to drop more consistently.\nThe same happens at the bottom of the battery too, when it hits 0%, it doesn't just run out of juice and die, it knows it has enough power reserved to perform a clean shutdown, and hold enough stuff like the date/time etc., or to be able to flash you an I need power! icon when you try to turn it back on.\nFinally, as to why you can seemingly recover charge after a reboot, it seems reasonable to assume that this is just an artifact of the process used to provide the user with a logical battery indication, rather than the real thing.  My physics isn't brilliant, but I believe that it's harder to record what the static voltage of a battery is when it's being used (as it's constantly draining), and during bootup it's probably actually using more power than when it's just sitting in your pocket and so on.  Tie in this with some algorithm that is adjusting for the general age and health of the battery anyway (If a battery has lost 20% of its capacity over the course of a couple of years, it won't simply get to 80% full and go no further, its physically capacity is reduced and the logical capacity needs adjusting to give the same 0-100% range, even if that range is now smaller) and it's easy to see there's plenty of room for the values to hop about a bit.\nThe key takeaway is that the numbers reported to the user are nothing more than a software adjusted \"approximation\" of available charge, and can vary on current usage etc.  It's not a defect :)\n\nA: If your iPhone does not charge to 100%, it means that the plug you are using to charge your phone is fake (it is not originally from the Apple store). Or you may have got it originally from the Apple store but it might be a little broken. My iPhone 4 was charging only to 97% a week ago, but 2 days later it charge up to 95%. What it meant was that my white plug was fake so I got an external charger from eBay and every time before I go to sleep I charge my phone and after in the morning when it is not 100%, I charge my iPhone 4 with my external charger then it charges to 100%. I did this for 3 days and now my iPhone has been charging to 100%. Another solution is that you buy a new charger from the apple store. By the way it does have the iOS 7.1.2 update (the latest one to date)\n", "Q: How can I close apps properly/shutdown the system via ssh?

That's right: Folderception.\nI solved this by simply deleting the first duplicate MyProject in the chain.\nHowever, I am curious, how could this have happened?\nIn order for it to copy itself enough times to yield 17GB, it would have to take quite a while - and I didn't even notice. But the more bizarre question is, what action could I have done to implicitly create a chain like this?\n\nA: This is entirely possible to create by making a hard link to the parent directory using the terminal 'ln' command. The OS just won't know that MyProject inside of MyProject goes to the same place.

This Windows machine is running a custom piece of software, and I'm running into trouble with the limited available memory.\nIs there a way to increase the RAM available for BootCamp and/or Windows 7?\nI may try to start over with a x64 Windows 7 installation, but I'm hesitant to do so because the custom program doesn't have any documentation, and I'm not sure how the compiler would react to the 64 bit environment.\n\nA: First, let me explain the problem a little: in 32-bit mode, the processor can only address 4GB of stuff. The problem is that \"stuff\" doesn't just include RAM, it includes RAM and memory-mapped I/O, most notably the video card. Since your new iMac has a bigger, better video card (with more video memory), it takes up more of the 4GB address space and there's less left for actual RAM.\nThere are several ways to make more RAM accessible to your program:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to 64-bit Windows. This allows the OS to address all of your RAM, and is really the right way to solve the problem. If you can't recompile your custom program for 64-bit mode, it should be able to run in 32-bit mode thanks to the WoW64 compatibility layer.\nDownsides: you'll have to do a custom install of the OS (meaning you basically start from scratch). There's also still a possibility that the program won't work (most likely if it includes 32-bit device drivers), and in this case you'd have to do another custom install to get back to 32-bit Windows. So, while this is really the best solution, you might want to try the other options first.\n\n*Enable physical address extension (PAE). If the driver supports it, this'll allow the video memory to be mapped above the usual 4GB limit, allowing you to use more of that 4GB for RAM. I haven't used this, but it looks pretty easy to enable and disable, so I'd be tempted to try this first.\n\n*Enable 4-Gigabyte tuning. This shifts how the address space is allocated, giving applications more and the kernel less. I'm not sure how this'd work (or even if it would work at all) in your situation, but it is another possibility. It can also be used together with PAE, so you can try different combinations to see what works.\n\nA: 32-bit operating systems cannot address to RAM over 2.2GB - 2.8GB (Depending on the type of RAM). Nonetheless 32GB is out of the question due to the CPU addressing algorithms used.\nTo be able to use all of the RAM, you will NEED to reinstall windows with a 64-bit installation.\nIf you have software that is not working correctly you have the option to run it in computability mode.\nIf that fails, last resort plan could be to run a virtual machine inside that runs a 32-bit version of windows so you can use that single program if computability mode doesn't work.\n\nA: First of all, if you have a program that that's 32 bit it will run fine in 64bit with out compatibility mode. The only time you really need compatibility mode is when you have vista drivers and want to run them on win 7, you would use compatibility mode. This also doesn't apply to mac only windows computers they for some reason need the exact drivers. I also would recommend you use the best possible drivers available because its going to allow your devices to perform at there fullest Potential. And 32bit is suppose to allow you to use 3.5 gb of ram max  you can install 4gb but it doesn't use it all.   email me if you have any questions.. \n", "Q: Flash Drive only mounts through USB Hub I have a PNY 32gb flash drive, when trying to connect the drive directly to my Mid 2012 MBP (specs attached) the drive never mounts, doesn't list in diskutil as an unmounted drive either, however when I plug the drive into a Micro Innovations USB Hub (old ~ 2002) the drive mounts (albeit slowly).\nOn my iMac (Mid 2010 I7) the drive works perfectly in the machine or through Apple USB Keyboard.\nAny help?\n\n\nA: I had a similar thing with an old pen drive that was faulty. \nFirst thing I would do is go to the Console and check whether the OS complains when you insert the pen drive.

I need to debug/view an IOS app's encrypted traffic, so i had captured SSL encrypted TCP packets via pirni. and trying to decrypt them via Wireshark. but i need session key for that. is there any way to export private key in IOS to be used with wireshark as in PKCS format?\n\nA: The private key in any SSL connection is on the server.\nEven if there were a private key on the client, it's only used for authentication not encryption.\n", "Q: How to grant web app access to restricted file? I am running a Tomcat server via Eclipse.\nI have a restricted file that contains information the web application running on Tomcat needs to perform its duties.\nI understand how to grant/deny access to regular users, but how to for this web app?\nInfo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro 10.7.5 (Lion)  \n\n*Tomcat 7 \n\n*Eclipse\n\n\nA: The first thing you need to do is discover which user owns the Tomcat process. You can do this by typing ps axu -w at the command line. The owner of the process will be in the first column. On a standard Mac install the web server (the process called httpd) is owned by the user _www. I assume Tomcat is owned by the same user.\nNow change the ownership of the file so it is owned by _www and then you will be fine. Do this chown _www filename replacing filename of course.\nOnce you've done that you should be right.\n\nA: Permissions on OS X are very similar to unix, so you could just make the file and folder readable by the user that you have chosen to run Tomcat.\nFinder Information lets you change things as well as chown and chmod from the terminal.\n", "Q: Monitor disk activity per volume without third-party software I have many disks/volumes connected to my OS X system.  I want to monitor, in real-time, read/write speed for each volume.\nOS 10.9 activity monitor shows only the cumulative numbers for all volumes, and it's not always accurate.\nThe commercial software iStatMenus will do this with one caveat:  RAID volumes show each disk separately, which is annoying.  Anyway I want to do this without third-party software, possibly in the command-line or a GUI.\n\nA: Try using iotop in Terminal:\niotop -C 5 12\n\nThis would output 12 samples, each 5 seconds long. See this answer for more information.\n", "Q: Tail multiple log files I have an application which generates new log files each time it is run.  They all go to one folder, with filenames like this, and the next log isn't started until the current one is finished.\nLog-20140122102407.txt\nLog-20140122102739.txt\nLog-20140122103640.txt\nLog-20140122162121.txt\nLog-20140122163145.txt\n\nI want to monitor the current progress in a terminal window like tail -f but that won't work with multiple files.  I've heard of multitail, but don't know how to use it, and I don't want my terminal window split into multiple sections.\n\nA: tail\ntail can tail multiple files. Donovan Bray's article explains more, tail: can tail multiple files simultaneously, who knew? and other tail tricks.\nTo tail multiple files, pass in a file pattern:\ntail -f Log-*\n\nmultitail\nYou can ask multitail to combine the output of multiple files. The examples page contains a useful approaches and tricks.\nThis command combines and tails two logs:\nmultitail /var/log/apache/access.log -I /var/log/apache/error.log\n\nIf you need to tail any logs in a folder, including those actively being created, use the -q flag:\nmultitail -q 'test*'\n\nThis will tail any files matching the pattern test*, including those that appear after the command has been issued. Thanks to @folkert-van-heusden for this suggestion and code fix.\nIf you have homebrew installed, you can install multitail using the Terminal.app command:\nbrew install multitail\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How-To: Tail Multiple Files With Multitail\n\n*Is there any Mac text editor with tail or watch files change feature?\n", "Q: What is the definition of \"recently added\" in my iTunes playlists? What is the definition of \"recently added\" in my iTunes playlists?  Are these songs that I have purposely added or could they be those songs added by iTunes because of my Genius playlist. I need to know if these songs could have been added by someone other than me.\n\nA: The \"Recently Added\" playlist is a smart playlist that is automatically generated based on the rules that define it. I have removed it from my machine, but if you right click it and select Edit Smart Playlist, you can see its rules. The playlist contains songs you've added yourself \"recently\" (you'll have to check yourself to see what \"recently\" means)\n\nA: They're songs added to your iTunes library by you.\nIt's a smart playlist with what I believe by default shows music added in the last two weeks.\n", "Q: How to find the real path of a file I am trying to access a file on my MacBook Pro via a web app running on Tomcat in Eclipse (localhost).  Whenever I try to access the file I receive the following IO Exception:\nException:  /private/var/appname/app_config.txt (No such file or directory)\n\nThis file does exist and when I use Apple+I the file info window gives this location:\n/private/var/appname\n\nSo why does the web app get the (No such file or directory) exception?  How do I get the real path if the file info window isn't valid via web app?\nEDIT\nThe permissions on the file in questions are:\n-rw-r--r--\n\nwhere the owner is the user context the web app is running under, which is determined by entering the following into the shell:\nps axu -w\n\nPermissions on the directory appname are as such:\ndrwxr-x---   \n\nwhere again, the owner is the user context the web app is running under.\nAnd finally, the directory var has permissions:\ndrwxr-xr-x\n\nwith root as owner.\n\nFurthermore, removing private from the path results in the exact same exception, sans the private in the path:\nException:  /var/appname/app_config.txt (No such file or directory)\n\n\nA: What user identity is the Tomcat / Apache application running as? While you can read the file with your account, if the application server is running as a limited rights user or in a chroot'd environment, you'll not be able to see the file. Find out the user account it is running as and try suing to that account then see if you can read the file.\n\nA: The first thing I would check is that Tomcat or Eclipse or whatever is that you are trying to access the file with has enough rights for the operation. It is not unusual for applications to report \"file not found\" when what they are trying to say is \"I cannot access the thing\"\nOpen Terminal, do \n\ncd /private/var/appname \n\nand then\n\nls -al \n\nand see who owns it and what mode the file reports, and then take it from there.\nGiven that /private/var/appname is not readable by everyone I'd add that to the permissions and see if that makes a difference.\nchmod a+r /private/var/appname \n\n", "Q: ARD and dockutil? This is probably a pretty noobish question, but here goes...\nI've recently discovered Kyle Crawford's dockutil, but I can't make it work with Apple Remote Desktop. Or rather: I can't make it work with ARD's \"Send UNIX Command\" feature. It works fine on single machines (i.e. working in Terminal on a remote Mac controlled via ARD), but sending dockutil commands to multiple Macs (with dockutil installed on them) fails.\nWhy? And is there a solution?\nIf anyone can shed any light on this I'd be really grateful.\nTIA.\n\nA: Are you using the complete path to your command? The \"Send UNIX command\" doesn't use the same PATH as you. If memory serves it uses the same one as the root login but it may be even shorter than that.\nI always put the complete path regardless.\n", "Q: Why doesn't MiniDisplay out work with Thunderbolt-only Target Display Mode iMacs? I realize this is kind of an AnandTech-fu level question.\nTechnically speaking, why doesn't a Thunderbolt iMac work in Target Display Mode with a computer that only has MiniDisplay out?  That is, what's preventing the 0s and 1s from happily going into the iMac's Thunderbolt port, especially when the iMac's happy to let MiniDisplay port adapters carry 0s and 1s on out to a monitor?  \nThat is, why can the iMac's Thunderbolt port do DisplayPort monitor out and not in? \n(I realize it's not exactly the same thing, etc.  What I'm getting at is if Apple simply didn't write the drivers to push you to use Mac laptops or if there's truly a technical hurdle that made supporting mini DisplayPort devices exceptionally difficult.)\nHow difficult, technically, would it be to create an adapter for MiniDisplay output into \"Thunderbolt output\" like the iMac & Target Display Mode expects?\nEdit: I can find a good deal of speculation that video should work (here or here, for example), but when I see someone who actually had a DisplayPort computer try with Thunderbolt monitors, it doesn't work. And Intel's Thunderbolt graphic only shows DisplayPort going one way.  Though that doesn't necessarily preclude taking in a DisplayPort feed, I suppose.\n\n\nA: The display port standard only supports a video signal going in one direction (source to destination). The video card can output via display port, but  handling a bidirectional connection would require extra hardware to handle the inbound signal, and isn't part of the standard.\nAFAIK the iMac's target display mode is done through the PCIe layer of thunderbolt, whereas the DisplayPort layer is only supported (by the graphics card) in the outgoing direction.\n", "Q: I cannot reach my ATV3 anymore after update MBA (late 2010) to 10.9 Since I updated my MacBook Air to 10.9 I cannot reach my AppleTV3 anymore. I know my MBA (Late 2010) will not be supported for mirroring anymore because of the lack of sandy bridge, but before the update I was able to stream Music and Videos out of iTunes to my ATV3.\nI checked, by using IP-Scanner to see that my ATV is screened in the same network (no subnet). I tried Airparrot and Beamer.app but they cannot find the ATV either. Is there a possibility to reach them anyway? I don't want to buy a new MBA just to stream my music to ATV!\n\nA: Have you made sure that your Apple TV (ATV) has the latest firmware?\nDo you have another Mac you can try to connect to the ATV?\nIf you have another Mac then you could also try running AirServer (they offer a 7 day free trial) on it and see if the Air can AirPlay to it.\nYou need a little more information about exactly what is going on before you can really find a solution.\n", "Q: Why do certain apps fill the background of Mission Control in Mavericks? Certain apps (Skype, Office for Mac 2010 or something like that) fill the background of the screen when I open Mission Control. When Mission control is focused on the space the app is in, all is well. When I switch to a different space, however, this happens. It is consistent (i.e. the same apps always do this, every time), and annoying. I've tried to find workarounds, but I haven't came up with anything. Any help is much appreciated.\n\n(Note that I rearranged the window to hide my contacts, but it has the same effect with the window maximized or in full screen.)\n\nA: This appears to have been fixed in either Yosemite or the latest version of Office. I've been using this combination for some time now and have yet to encounter this. (I haven't tried Skype, though.)\n", "Q: How to hide non-openable in the finder while using an application to browse/open For example, in the following picture. I am using TeXstudio to open a .tex file. After pressing Cmd-O, the files with extensions that are not in the extension drop-down menu (\"TeX files (*.tex, *.bib, etc)\") are gray items in the pop-up Finder window. \n\nMy question is: How to hide these files? Is there a keyboard shortcut to do this?\n\nA: No, there is no way to hide these files. It's a usability decision by Apple.\nThe dialog always shows the same list of files but greys out the ones you currently cannot open. Technically you could go to the pop up at the bottom and change it to All files and open any of the files listed. Of course they may not make sense in the application, but you could open them. \n", "Q: Changing OSX Mavericks Server to default to personal website rather than welcome page I've looked at every option in OSX Server for Mavericks but I don't see anything that allows me to default to my website rather than the \"Welcome to Server\" page. I have a DNS set up through Godaddy. I had no issues before I installed OSX server. I tried using an alias but that still requires that the URL I provide people has to include that alias. Not a good solution. \n\nA: The way to do this within Mavericks Server is to adjust the Server Website Preferences to the folder you are locating your HTML pages.\nHere's how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the Server application, and select on Websites, under\nServices.\n\n*Double click on \"Server Website\" under Websites.\n\n*Next to the option titled \"Store Site Files In:\", click the text\nbox, select \"Other...\", navigate to the location where your website\nis stored, and select its top level folder.\n\n*Click the \"OK\" button\n\n\nThat should be all. If networking/DNS/Port Forwarding are properly set, you should now be able to load your site. \n", "Q: In Mavericks, how can I make Paste and Match Style the default for Cmd-V? The instructions for Mountain Lion and other OSs do not seem to apply to Mavericks.\n\nA: While it may not work in all applications there is a way of doing this for a large number. Certainly it works in Pages, Numbers and TextEdit but not Microsoft Word, where you have to do it within the application.\nAll you need to do is open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and select App Shortcuts in the left hand pane. Click on All Applications in the right hand pane and the + at the bottom.\nIn the Menu Title field enter Paste and Match Style then click in the Keyboard Shortcut field and press command-V. Then click on Add\nYou will now see that your shortcut is added. When you open Pages, for example, you will see that Paste no longer has a shortcut (you could add one using the same method) and right next to Paste and Match Style in the Edit menu is your new working shortcut,command-V. Oh, frabjous joy!\n\nA: defaults write .GlobalPreferences -dict-add NSUserKeyEquivalents \"Paste and Match Style\" -string \"@v”\n\n\nA: I use the following command to maximize the current window in macOS Mojave (10.14):\ndefaults write -globalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Zoom\" \"@\\$m\";\n\nso, I suppose this must work in your case:\ndefaults write -globalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Paste and Match Style\" \"@\\$v\";\n\nfor other keys use:\nCommand: @\nControl: ^\nOption: ~\nShift: $\nTab: \\U21e5 (Unicode code point for ⇥ character)\n\n", "Q: iOS 7 iPhone how can I close my running applications? I have an iPhone 4 and just updated the software to i OS 7. Before I updated the software I had been able to close my running apps to keep from running down the battery. I can't figure out now how to close them. Is there a way or do theft close themselves or what? \n\nA: Double clic on the home button then slide the apps to the top to quit them. \n\nA: You can kill running applications by swiping them upwards after double tapping the Home button.\nYou can also disable background app refresh (a new iOS 7 feature) by disabling it under: Settings > General > Background App Refresh.\nApplications typically stay running as long as the OS has enough resources for it, until reboot, or until you manually kill them. Some iOS applications can run in the background while actively using your phone's CPU (music players are a good example). iOS may kill background applications to give a foreground application more resources.\n\nA: Same way as before. But iOS does a great job of managing running resources for you, so if you have a decrease of battery life, it could be that the OS is to much for your phone to handle, depending on which iPhone it is of course. \"Multi-Tasking\" in iOS is really just recently used applications (which is where you double click home and swipe up) and the background app refresh works pretty well.\nUltimately though, iPhones are meant to be self-sufficient, even in the matters of running processes. I understand you thinking that apps running in the background are the cause in the decrease of battery life, but maybe it could be iOS 7. After updating my 4S, My already-bad battery life decreased even more, no matter what I did. So I guess you either have to get a new phone or suffer, because the new design of iOS 7 is just to much for older phones. \n", "Q: How to find out which terminal app (iTerm or Terminal) is running from within bash I need to have different color schemes for each of the two terminal types I use. I can set it in the .bash_profile as mentioned here. But how can I tell it to differ depending whether its a iTerm2 or default terminal instance?\n\nA: There is an environment variable set by iTerm and by Terminal as the following:\nfor Terminal:\nTERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal\n\nfor iTerm:\nTERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app\n\nYou should see this variable by typing in env from the command line.\nSo - using this variable, you can put a condition in your .bash_profile to select the proper coloring.\n", "Q: Configure and personalise external keyboard buttons on Mac? Ok, in fact what I am trying to customise and personalise are mouse buttons. As seen from my previous question here, I use SteerMouse to successfully configure the buttons on my Logitech M545 mouse.\nHowever, there are two buttons, the side buttons, that cannot be detected by SteerMouse. After testing, I find that these two buttons, when pressed, actually correspond to keyboard operations. That is why SteerMouse is not able to configure them two.\nTherefore, my question is equivalent to configuring two buttons of an external keyboard. How may I do this?\n\nA: The first step might be to discover what key codes they are putting out. Key Codes will do this for you.\nThen you will find that KeyRemap4Macbook will allow you to map those keycodes to something useful.\n", "Q: iPhone error \"Unable to connect to network\" Two iPhone's in the house, a model 4 (on iOS 6) and a model 5 (on iOS 7), can not connect to the home WiFi network, but can connect at the Apple shop. All other devices on the home network, including desktops, laptops and Android's, are fine.\nThe error message is displayed about 0.5 seconds after hitting \"Join\", and is simply \"Unable to Join Network\".\nTrawling forums the advice seems to be to a combination of resetting the network settings on the iPhone and turning the router and iPhone off and on again in various orders.\nHowever, this does not work.\n\nA: Whilst I have no idea what caused the problem, it was solved in this case by \n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling security on the Wi-Fi network, \n\n*Connecting the devices to the unsecured network (which worked), \n\n*Re-enable security, \n\n*Connecting the devices to the secured network.\n\n\nSomehow, this solved the problem and all devices were able to connect normally.\nOn our TP-LINK router, a reboot was required whenever the security settings were changed, i.e. after steps (1) and (3).\nRebooting the phone's was not required, though I think I may have turned the Wi-Fi on the phone off and on again.\nHope it helps! \n\nA: UNplugged my router. Waited a few minutes and plugged router back in.  That was all it took!  IPhone now has wifi again.\n\nA: I am trying to connect my laptop (Acer) to my iPhone's data using hotspot. When I look on my networks menu, I see the label 'iPhone'. However, when I try to connect to it my laptop, my phone flashes on and off. In the end my laptop will say \" Unable to connect to this network\". I never used to have this problem.

When I try iostat disk5, I get the error:  \niostat: could not record 'disk5' for monitoring\n\nIostat works with my other drives, and with the individual disks which make up the RAID volume.  How can I get the speed of disk5, which is an AppleRAID volume?\n\nA: BSD iostat - yeeeecchhhhh. There are some things that Gnu/Linux just does better.\nWhat happens when you try iostat -d -n 9 - that should give you an iostat on the first 9 drives hooked up (if you have 9 drives).\n", "Q: How can I generate a batch of profiles and certificates for OS X Server Profile Manager? I'm using the Profile Manager on OS X Server (Mavericks). I ran a script that imported our ~20 users into Open Directory from CSV. I've configured Radius with EAP-TLS, and have set up 802.1x so that our WiFi APs and router authenticate with the Radius server.\nI've generated a self-signed CA for Radius, and a client certificate for myself, using Keychain Access. I managed to export my client certificate, upload it to the Profile Manager web interface, upload the Radius server's trusted certificate, configure all the network settings as payloads, download and install my profile, and get connected to our WiFi.\nI have to set up over 20 more profiles, and it's a huge PITA to manually generate all these certificates, upload them, and configure WiFi settings for each individual user.\nI know I can programmatically generate the client certificates with openssl on the command line. I used dscl to work with Open Directory, but is there a command-line tool that can push payloads into Profile Manager?\nOr would it be easier if I just programmatically generate the .mobileconfig XML files and email / AirDrop them out to each user?\nI want to know how a regular small business IT person rolls out network settings and profiles to an office, but it's really hard to find documentation on this topic. I also have a few follow-up questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*How do you manage a PKI on Mac Server, and how do you use it with Profile Manager?\n\n*I've set a temporary password for users, but how can I allow them to sign in and change their Open Directory password?\n\n\nA: You should be able to do all the configuration by group.\nAdd all the users into an OD group and then set all the WiFi preferences there. You should also be able to set a certificate for the group and allow the entire group to authenticate against the Radius server.\nWhen it comes to setting up PKI then you enter into the dark realms of Kerberos. (Be very careful with your DNS or you will never return.)\nThis is a good guide http://yesdevnull.net/2013/10/os-x-mavericks-server-open-directory-master/\nReading everything Charles Edge writes is always worthwhile :- http://krypted.com/guides/mavericks-server/ - he literally wrote the book on Macs in the enterprise.\nIf you turn on the web server (which I assume you have for the Profile Manager) the front page provides a nice link to change passwords for OD users.\n", "Q: Which Remote Desktop works with Control Keys? I am trying to control an iTerm2 session on an iPad mini through Remote Desktop using an Apple BT keyboard (Japanese).\nWhen I tried this out with Splashtop, the backspace key and all control keys don't work.\nWhich Remote Desktop works well with the Apple BT keyboard on iPad mini?\n\nA: I would recommend RealVNC VNC Viewer.\nIt allows the capability to use all the keys on a real keyboard (command, control, option, etc.), even the function keys. Almost any remote deskop application out there uses VNC to handle the screen sharing. VNC Viewer works just fine with Apple Remote Desktop and Bonjour, Terminal, Xterm, and iTerm2 — just open port 5900.\n*There's a free version, and a full version (normally $10 for iOS), although the full version is free at this very moment, so grab it while you can. \n\nA: Just to make sure we are talking abut the right thing. You are connecting to Screen Sharing on a Mac from an iPad and the iPad is using an Apple BlueTooth keyboard as an external keyboard.\nYou want to be able to use the control keys, backspace key and such on the BlueTooth keyboard.\nThe first and cheapest VNC app to do this is the free \"VNC Viewer\". The paid version of \"Mocha VNC\" also works fine.  If you want something that will do the same sort of tunneling as Splashtop then \"Screens\" works and tunnels via \"Screens Connect\".\nI don't have iTerm on my Mac but everything worked fine in \"Terminal\".\n", "Q: How can I retrieve photos from a damaged iPhone 3GS? Is there ANY way possible (NO MATTER WHAT THE EXTREMES), to retrieve my photos off of my husband's iPhone 3G/3GS? My husband of 13 yrs. was diagnosed with bone cancer and passed away 21 hours later. Every memory of the prior 4 months the kids and I had with him, the hospital 'til the devastating end is on that iPhone & it was dropped in the drive and run over, but still intact, just broken screen is only visible damage. Please help...!!!!\n\nA: We may need a bit more information, but some suggestions...\nFirst, I assume you've checked that the photos were never imported onto a computer in any way? Obviously this would make retrieval unnecessary if they have been copied to a computer/hard drive, imported into iPhoto/Picasa/etc... but I guess that hasn't happened in the last 4 months...?\nWas iCloud Photostream turned on? You may be able to directly access the last 30 days worth of photos already, via iCloud or software that supports Photostream.\nWas DropBox installed on the phone? DropBox has a Camera Import feature, which, if turned on, backs up your camera roll photos to your dropbox account.\nWas the phone setup to backup to iCloud? You may simply be able to restore another iPhone from the backup, getting all photos from the camera roll back (assuming a complete backup; though if there's a lot of photos it may have gone over the free 5GB limit).\nWas it set to backup to iTunes? If it's recently been backed up, you can also restore another iPhone from the backup.\nDoes the phone still power up? This is hard to tell if the screen is broken, but if it shows up on a computer when plugged in via USB then you may be able to recover information over USB. In that case you could use iExplore to access the contents of the phone. I believe iExplore can also browse an iTunes backup. And if it does work, this would be a good time to ensure you take a backup.\nIf all answers are no, then you would want to find an iPhone repair shop. Apple themselves may be able to do this. There are limits, however. If the memory chip itself is damaged, the data will be lost. The iPhone data is also encrypted using an encryption key, and I'm not sure whether this relies on any hardware components or if it's purely in software—if the key is derived from the main board or some other chip on in the phone (not just a software key) then you would need all relevant parts to be still functional to retrieve the data. This is something Apple or a repairer will be able to tell you.\n\nA: Don't mean to be the barer of bad news, but its unlikely Apple will help you with any sort of data recovery, unless its an extreme circumstance like you have a warrant, a court order, or maybe just power of attorney, and are dealing directly with their legal department.  They should be able to replace his screen, if thats the phone's only problem.  Is the phone locked with a passcode?  Do you know the passcode?\nAssuming its more than just a broken screen, the above answer does contain a lot of good ideas.  If the device is functional (it turns on and recognized by a computer) but is passcode locked, you could still sync it with the computer your husband was syncing with previously (assuming he has ever synced it).  If its not passcode locked you should be able to download the pictures onto any computer(since it won't need to know the passcode).  Lastly, if it is passcode locked and your husband did not sync it with any computer previously (your computer does not know his passcode), your best bet is to talk to professional data recovery companies, like Drive Savers etc.  This is your worst case scenario, seek professional data recovery.\n", "Q: Can I tell iPhoto to store photos in one directory within the library? When I add photos to iPhoto 11, it copies them into its internal database. This is good, but it creates a bunch of numbered folders. Is there a way for me to tell iPhoto not to do that, and to just use one folder for all the photos?\nThat way, when I want to access the photos directly, say to upload to Google+, I don't have to collect them from multiple folders.\nI could use iPhoto's Export function, but that apparently insists on re-encoding the photos :( This naturally decreases quality and increases file size (if you choose the Maximum quality setting).\nLightroom, for example, gives me control over where the files are actually stored. The storage is still managed by Lightroom, but I can tell it to store all my photos in one directory, in this case.\n\nA: No. iPhoto does not allow you to dictate the internal storage scheme. However, the export function does have an option to export the original file, so you can avoid the re sampling and/or format conversion if that is enough to stick with what you have. Additionally, Aperture and iPhoto can use the same storage, so you could get aperture and do the following;\n\n\n*\n\n*convert the storage of any photos you want to folders and then save the library. \n\n*continue to use iPhoto for convenient tasks and iPhoto will work with the aperture store locations. \n\n*do all imports in aperture when you want the originals stored in specific folders. \n\n\nYou can use Lightroom, PhotoMechanic or Aperture which all allow whatever folder based storage of photos you prefer. \n", "Q: How can I make Siri's geo-fenced reminders wait until I actually arrive? I'm walking my dog and tell Siri, \"When I get home, remind me to take out the trash.\" It sets up a reminder keyed to my arrival at a location, my home address. So far so good, but the reminder actually goes off when I'm still about a block from home. By the time I actually get home, I've forgotten all about it.\nIs there any way to make Siri/Reminders more accurately assess whether I've arrived or not?\n\nA: You don't have precise range control over geo fenced reminders with non iBeacon input. Both GPS and WiFi and cell tower location can trigger locations a good block or more away from a precise location.\nUntil you have iBeacon hardware or software set up, you can snooze that reminder, set a follow on time based reminder or change the original reminder to go off time rather than proximity. \nThe best you could do is offset the home location to coordinates several hundred feet away from where you typically approach and keep the same default 100m/330ft radius that iOS lets you make larger, but not smaller on iOS 7.\n\nA: I have the same problem. I want to be reminded to start my workout tracking app at the ice skating rink, but always get reminded before I get there. \nIt's a hack, but works if you will know which direction you'll arrive from. I set the location to be behind where I want to arrive and increase the radius to just where my intended location is. You will have to test the radius and adjust if it's not going off. \nIt would be nice if I could be reminded 15 minutes after arriving. \n\nA: You will need to change the location radius per reminder. \nSee the follow page http://forums.imore.com/guides-how-articles/262696-guide-how-set-location-based-reminder-ios-7-reminders-app.html\nstep 10\nIf you set a named location it should work.  something like \"home\"\n", "Q: Searching for available Apple Developer account names I am about to set up a company but I have a suspicion another developer has taken the name that we would intend to trade under for a developer account.\nWe're setting up our business in the UK, and the official registration office (companies house) claims the name is available as far as 'the company' is concerned, but is there some way I can check if the Apple Developer account name will be available before actually forming the company? Will it be a problem or can we and this third party both trade under near-identical names? (for example fuzzy games and fuzzy-games).\n\nA: As far as I know you can pick any name as you like, as long as your company details shared with Apple are correct. And yes, they check everything before you get approved - took me a few weeks to fix the details with them because they've missed the \"Inc.\"\nDo you really want to change your future company name if the account is taken as Apple ID? There are many many many companies around with similar names, or near similar names.\nJust take the name you had in mind, as long as your company details match there is nothing they can do to disapprove your Apple ID.\n\nA: Apple doesn't disclose other people's names to you when you sign up, so fill out the forms correctly and press submit. \nYou will make many mistakes in the first year of creating a business, most of which involve agonizing over things you can and will change later. If you corporate structure isn't set, my advice is to start with a personal developer account now and get to work. You can contact Apple Developer relations to change from a personal account to a corporate one mid-stream if needed before (and even after) putting your app up for public release. \nYou also will get notified if trademark infringement comes up, but again that is more a legal issue than something about how the store or iTunes connect account works. \n", "Q: Can I restrict ios to only one WiFi connection/SSID? We have about 20 iPads for our business. We would like to restrict these devices to only be able to access our protected WiFi here and the devices from connecting to others.

These features included compressed object streams in v1.4.\nA PDF file can look identical but be stored on disk in nearly infinitely different forms. The application responsible for creating the PDF is critical to getting the smallest possible file size.\nMost applications, such as Preview, will call out to a general purpose PDF framework or library to deal with the file format. This will result in well formed files with minimal effort by the application's developers.\nOther applications may create PDFs highly-tuned to their content and needs. The PDF specification allows for creative reuse of content, de-duplication, and optimisations that require knowledge of the document's purpose and intention. This requires significant effort and is increasingly rare.\n\nA: When duplicating, Preview embeds all fonts to the pdf document which results in a larger file. A very useful feature if you need a simple way to embed all fonts. \n", "Q: Vagrant/VirtualBox extremely slow despite 8GB-RAM/SSD-HD/2.53GHz Core2Duo My VM (Ubuntu Vagrant VM) is extremely slow. While my Windows co-workers have a maximum of 1 minute page load time, my page load takes up to 8 minutes.\nI tried putting log files in non shared folders—no Effect. I tried fiddling with the VirtualBox settings, but I do not know what I am doing there.\nIt really got worse with the Mavericks Update.\nAnyone any ideas?\nMy System:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBookPro 2.53GHz Core2Duo\n\n*8GB-RAM\n\n*512MB SSD\n\n\nMy VirtualBox (4.2.22) Settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU 1 Core\n\n*RAM 2048MB\n\n*Hardware Acceleration enabled (VT-x/AMD-V)\n\n*Nested Packaging enabled\n\n\nDue to a shared Vagrant file, the Windows user have the same VirtualBox settings.\n\nLATE UPDATE: The Improvements that worked so far\nAfter i had switched Laptops, now i am back to working with a VM on my Mac so i got back to this Topic.\nSFTP Sync via IDE instead of SMB or Shared Folders\nI stopped using shared Folders and instead i let my IDE (PHP Storm) sync the Files to teh VM via SFTP. So i am working in a local directory and the VM get's the files via SFTP Sync.\nThis was a huge Improvement.\nThe Adjustment of the Cores helped a tiny bit\nSee Answer by @zigg.\nChanged Drive Setting to SSD in VM wich helped a tiny bit\nSee Answer by @IljaPavkovic.\n\nA: try enabling SSD on the virtual drive. This helped in my environment.\nAs I cannot answer to comments: \n\n\n*\n\n*settings->storage\n\n*mark hard disk\n\n*click \"Solid-State Drive\"\n\n\nA: Don't use shared folders.  Mount a Samba folder from your host machine to access/edit your source.  It is way faster.\n\nA: Your performance hit could be that you're running a four-core VM on a dual-core machine.\nThe VirtualBox manual says:\n\nOn the \"Processor\" tab, you can set how many virtual CPU cores the guest operating systems should see. Starting with version 3.0, VirtualBox supports symmetrical multiprocessing (SMP) and can present up to 32 virtual CPU cores to each virtual machine.\nYou should not, however, configure virtual machines to use more CPU cores than you have available physically (real cores, no hyperthreads).\n\nTry reducing the cores in your VM and see if that helps your problem.  If it does, the Vagrant configuration will likely also have to be updated.\n\nA: If you have some process inside the VirtualBox virtual machine that accesses shared folders frequently (perhaps polling some file for changes), that could degrade performance considerably due to the VirtualBox shared folder implementation.\nThe Vagrant documentation says: \"In some cases the default shared folder implementations (such as VirtualBox shared folders) have high performance penalties. If you're seeing less than ideal performance with synced folders, NFS can offer a solution. Vagrant has built-in support to orchestrate the configuration of the NFS server on the host and guest for you.\"\nIn this case it might be worth trying out Vagrant's NFS-based synced folders instead.\n\nA: Just to let you know, that if the NFS shares with Vagrant are still too slow for you, you can do the contrary : instead of installing a NFS server on your host machine, you can install it on the VM guest : http://guillaumeduveau.com/en/drupal-lightning-fast-synced-folders-in-vagrant-virtualbox/\n", "Q: define local keyword globally in a macports config My main target is to globally enable all ports to compile with macports-clang-3.4 and use libc++ instead of libstdc++.\nFor example when working with one port I need to set configure.compiler=macports-clang-3.4 and configure.cxx_stdlib=c++11 to the command line. But how I can set this variables via macports configuration globally so that any invocation of port would automatically use my defaults? variants.conf accepts only variants and no keywords and macports.conf only includes global keywords.\n\nA: I'm assuming you're on a system < Mavericks because otherwise libc++ and a recent clang would already be your default and forcing it wouldn't make a lot of sense.\nUse MacPorts trunk (or wait for the 2.3 release) and set the following options in $prefix/etc/macports.conf:\n\n\n*\n\n*cxx_stdlib libc++\n\n*buildfromsource always\n\n*delete_la_files yes\nIf you use Xcode >= 4.2 I wouldn't bother changing the default compiler, since system clang is already the preferred MacPorts compiler and some ports specifically change that if that doesn't work (which might break if you force it to be a different compiler). If a port doesn't work with your version of system clang, but will work with a newer clang, ports will usually automatically choose a macports-clang instead.\nIf you use Xcode < 4.2, add default_compilers macports-clang-3.4 macports-clang-3.3 macports-llvm-gcc-4.2 apple-gcc-4.2 to your macports.conf. Note that doing this is entirely unsupported, deliberately undocumented, and if it breaks you get to keep the pieces.\nYou need to reinstall all your ports after doing that.\n", "Q: How can I retrieve the complete \"Documents and Data\" from iCloud to my Mac?

I don't care if any data is lost or anything.\nIt's iPod 4G 8gb and I can't install iOs7 'cause of that.\n\nA: Just use iTunes and restore it.\nYou could also use your jailbrooken backup to get your saves and stuff back, or just start a clean one and let iCloud sync contacts and primary stuff back.\n\nA: Just upgrade the iOS if you haven't already. Or restore it using iTunes. Or you could reset the iPod by holding both power and home buttons until it gets to the lock screen.\n", "Q: Search file duplicates in OSX by hash I am looking for a way to search for a determinate file in OSX (Maverick but more generally OSX).\nIn particular I would like to do the following:\ngiven a File_001 I'd like to search if in the filesystem exists a copy of this file.\nNot just with the same name, I would like the comparison method to be an hashing algorithm like MD5, SHA etc..  \nMost of the \"duplicate file finder\" I have tried just search for all the duplicates in a drive/system. I would, instead, be interested in submitting one file and search for its duplicates.\nDoes anyone know if such a program exists? Maybe some obscure function of Spotlight?\n\nA: You can easily build this yourself with some shell commands:\n\n*\n\n*find ~ -type f -exec md5 -r '{}' \\; > /tmp/md5.list\nwill build a list of md5 hashes over all your files.\n\n\n*grep $(md5 -q FILE-TO-SEARCH) /tmp/md5.list\nwill search for the md5 hash of FILE-TO-SEARCH\nRunning the first command (especially if you run it across the whole disc) will take a long time though.\n\nIf you only want to search for one file, you can also use\nSIZE=$(stat -f '%z' FILE-TO-SEARCH)\nMD5=$(md5 -q FILE-TO-SEARCH)\nfind ~ -type f -size ${SIZE}c | while read f; do\n    [[ $MD5 = $(md5 -q \"$f\") ]] && echo $f\ndone\n    \n\n\nA: You might also use fdupes. It doesn't have an option to search for duplicates of a specific file, but you can just grep the output for the filename:\nfdupes -r1 .|grep filename\n\n-r recurses into directories and -1 prints each group of duplicate files on a single line.\nOther useful examples:\nfdupes -r .  finds all duplicate files under the current directory;\nfdupes -r . -dN  deletes all except the first duplicate from each group of duplicates;\nfdupes -r dir1 dir2|grep dir1/|xargs rm removes duplicates in dir1.\nYou can install fdupes with brew install fdupes.\n\nA: This should work if you substitute the size and hash for FILE_001 into the command.\n198452 bytes is the file size I used and the file md5 hash is 3915dc84b4f464d0d550113287c8273b \nfind . -type f -size 198452c -exec md5 -r {} \\; |\n    grep -o \"3915dc84b4f464d0d550113287c8273b\\ \\(.*\\)\" | awk '{print $2}'\n\nThe output will be a list of files with path names relative to the directory sent to the find command.\nThis approach has the advantage that it will only hash files that match the size of your original and will only output file names that match the hash.\n\nA: If you don't want to mess with scripts, you can get close to the behavior you want with Araxis Find Duplicate Files $10 in the Mac App Store. There is also a 7 day demo on their web site. Find Duplicate Files searches for dupes by computing the hash for each file.\nYou can approximate the behavior you want you would set up a folder with the single file you are concerned about, then add the folders you want to search in. This will also report other dupes, if there are any, in the search paths.\nThis app has many nice sorting features making the results very easy to understand.\n", "Q: Screen Recording in Quick Time 7 not available Just bought a new MacBook Pro 15\" Retina display laptop with Maverick.

I've tried several tools and also through the terminal using the ln command.\nI am on a fresh install and using the ln command worked fine before. Any idea what's up?\nThanks,\nWill\n\nA: Let's try a few experiments, and look at a few things.\nIn a terminal emulator, such as Terminal.app in /Applications/Utilities, go to your home directory (cd ~) and create a directory (mkdir [directory]).\nMake sure you go in the directory we just created (cd [directory]).\ncd ~\nmkdir directory\ncd directory\n\nAfter that, make a file; a simple text file will do:\necho \"This is a simple text file\" > originalfile.txt\nls -l@\n\nNow, try creating a hard link, like this:\n/usr/bin/ln originalfile.txt hardlink.txt\n\nThen, try creating a symbolic link, like this: \n/usr/bin/ln -s originalfile.txt symboliclink.txt\n\nNow, open the directory in Finder with open . and make an alias.\nIn the terminal emulator you opened before, another ls should get us this:\nTestarossa:test tonyw$ ls -l@\ntotal 2528\n-rw-r--r--  2 tonyw  staff      19 25 Jan 15:51 file.txt\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 tonyw  staff  426048 25 Jan 15:52 file.txt alias\ncom.apple.FinderInfo        32 \ncom.apple.ResourceFork  850686 \n-rw-r--r--  2 tonyw  staff      19 25 Jan 15:51 hard.txt\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 tonyw  staff       8 25 Jan 15:53 symbolic.txt -> file.txt\n\nThe Finder GUI should result in this, too:\n\nPlease note that the Finder GUI displays a symbolic link as an alias.\nA symbolic link is not the same thing as an alias. A real alias has extended attributes than a symbolic link.\nIn the Finder GUI, there is no way of telling a hard link is anything but a file.\nFor any symbolic links, there is an 'l' at the left hand end of the attributes, and the ls command tells us where it points.\nWhen you try this, exactly what do you get?\n\nA: OS X can create both, but in different ways.  As you seem to be using the word alias it is a file (or directory) shortcut that was created in Finder for anything you see listed there, whereas a symlink (symbolic link) can be created in a shell instance started by your terminal app by using the command:\nln -s <source file path><target file path>\n\nA symlink cannot be created directly in a Finder window (indirectly perhaps by calling an AppleScript script from a shell script or vice-versa).\nBut there is an ambiguity here because there is another kind of alias, which is a user-defined nickname that you can give to a sequence of shell commands when you open a terminal session. For example in a bash shell window:\n$ alias listall=ls -al`\n\nThis defines a nickname listall for the command ls -al to list all files in the current directory.  In this context 'alias' describes command nicknames - alias is actually a bash shell built-in command for creating such nicknames.\nI am not an expert on the OS X filesystem, just a user and scripter, but from what I have read the reason why a Finder alias does not break in OS X is because it contains a unique serial number for its target file (called an inode number, that exists for each file and directory) that is independent of its file path.  This means that if you move the target to another directory then the alias will still point to it, whereas a symlink would break because it uses the file path of the target.\n\nA: You can't natively create symlinks (symbolic links) in Finder, only aliases.  You can, however, use AppleScript to create symlinks if this is what you ultimately need.\nTo understand why this is so, we must understand the difference between aliases, symlinks, and hard links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Aliases are Finder conventions; meaning they only work within Finder and not in the UNIX environment of OS X.  They are small data files and your shell (bash, sh, zsh, etc.) don't know how to interpret them.\n\n*Symbolic Links (symlinks for short) are shortcuts that are part of the *NIX filesystem. Finder treats them as quasi aliases, you can see them and use them, but they contain none of the extra metadata that Finder aliases contain.\n\n*Hard Links are quite similar to aliases in Finder except they don't contain the path to the the original file.  Hard links appear as regular files within Finder; you will not know you are not working with the original file, rather the linked one.  Hard links are what ln creates by default when you omit the -s flag.\nFor further details, I have written about this more in depth on this answer.\nThe bottom line here is that you will only be able to create symlinks and hard links  in Terminal (UNIX environment of OS X) but use them globally.  You will only be able to create and use aliases within Finder.  (IMO) Because of this, I stay away from aliases and use symlinks pretty much exclusively.\n\nA: I had this problem. Tried saving the link to a different folder. With a bit of trial and error it worked. No idea why.\n", "Q: Found mail message in Outlook for Mac, but want to find the source folder Because I find that Outlook's internal search is sometimes unreliable, I occasionally use the Mac's spotlight search to find a particular mail message. This allows me to locate the message, which I can open, but I cannot find a way to determine the folder in which the message is stored. (I think my question is different from \"Outlook for Mac 2011: How to find the folder where a message is stored?\" because the user there was using Outlook's internal search and getting a list of emails in an Outlook table of messages. My problem is that my external search only goes into Outlook once I have opened the single message I am looking for, and so there is no table listing all messages found according to the search criteria, with columns that allow a \"folder\" column to be displayed)\n\nA: The internal search for Outlook:Mac 2011 is Spotlight search.  \nWhen you search from Spotlight outside of Outlook:Mac, and you select a result, that email is opened in a new window.  The title of that window is \"subject - folder\".  This isn't perfect, since it only tells you the name of the parent folder.  If you have a deep folder structure, or if you reuse folder names, you'll have to figure out where that particular folder lives.\n", "Q: Can I use a Time Capsule to share internet connection? My internet provider limits the number of connected devices to two. I would like to know whether I can use a Time Capsule to share my signal with all other devices in my house?\n\nA: Yes, you can use either the Ethernet ports or WiFi (or both) to allow a Time Capsule to act as a router and share out your connection. Your ISP will, if you set it up in the default manner, have no way of knowing how many devices you have connected using the Time Capsule.\nInternally a Time Capsule is actually an AirPort Base Station with a hard drive attached so it makes a great router and WiFi base station. Just connect the Time Capsule to your modem/router using the WAN port on the Time Capsule.\n", "Q: MacOS, differences between running a bundled app and running the bundle's executable Can someone elaborate the differences in OSX between running a bundled application by doing one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*double-clicking on it\n\n*search for it and run it from spotlight\n\n*open /Application/MyApp.app\n\n\nor just running its executable in Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*$ /Application/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp (the executable binary)\n\nA: In most cases there is no difference. However, inside every App bundle is an Info.plist file that contains information about the App that is useful (mainly) to Mac OS X (the types of files it handles, etc.).\nBut the Info.plist file can also contain information about the environment that the App needs to run in. For example, the Info.plist file can contain environment variables that need to be set before the executable is launched. If you launch the executable yourself (on the command line) then those variables won't be set and the behavior of the App might be different.\nEDIT: To elaborate on this a little further, if you right-click on an App and \"Show Package Contents\", then drill down to \"Contents:MacOS\" and double-click the executable icon in that directory, you will also bypass launch services and information in the Info.plist file will be ignored. So you can do in the Finder what you are doing on the command line (without command-line options, of course).\n", "Q: Mail spelling checker will not stop This is driving me crazy.\nI have gone into Preferences and set spellchecking -> NEVER\nBut it will not stop!  \n:\n  :\n\nThis gets my goat.

The option is simply not in the print dialog box. I finally discovered that this is due to using a case-sensitive file system. What I see is the following:\n\nI can use the Layout options to accomplish a similar effect, but I can't print handouts with notes, etc. It turns out that this problem affects all of Office (Word and Excel as well).\nWhat I should see is\n\nOther than reformatting my hard drive as case-insensitive and restoring from my Time Machine backup, is there any way to correct this behavior?\nEDIT: Please note that in the first dialog, Apple's default \"Copies\" and \"Pages\" options are displayed above the pop-up menu. In Microsoft's print dialog extension (second image above) Word, Excel, and PowerPoint present their own \"Copies\" and \"Slides\" and \"Print What\" (etc.) options under the \"Copies & Pages\" pop-up. There simply is no \"Copies & Pages\" option when running on a case sensitive file system, so there is no way to print handouts, speaker notes, etc. Case sensitivity apparently causes the Office print dialog extension to fail to load.\nI've used otool to dig through the dynamic libraries and frameworks involved, looking for a possible case mis-match, but so far have come up empty.\nEDIT 2: There simply is no \"Copies & Pages\" option in the popup dialog on a case-sensitive file system, I've attached a third image that shows the options available to me:\n\nIt is simply not there. As stated in the previous edit, they are above the pop-up menu. In fact, PowerPoint ignores the settings there, since it is expecting the options from the custom plugin Office provide. So I can ONLY print a single copy of a full document, unless I jump into Preview first.\n\nA: I just solved this on my own machine. Very frustrating.\nThe issue is that the missing section of the print dialog is a \"Print Dialog Extension\" (PDE). This is loaded from the individual Office apps' plugin directories. The issue is that Office is coded to look for a \"PlugIns\" directory whereas the directory is actually named \"Plugins\".\nI suggest using a symbolic link to fix this. Presuming you have a default installation of Office then open Terminal, and execute: \ncd \"/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft PowerPoint.app/Contents/\"\nln -s Plugins PlugIns\n\nRelaunch Powerpoint and bask in the delicious print dialog extensions. BTW, you will need to do something similar for the other Office apps.\nNOTE: I advise against simply renaming the Plugins directory to PlugIns. It might break something else.\n\nA: Roadkill's analysis is correct, but if you want to convert your volume to a case-insensitive file system (which may be a better long-term solution), the suggestion in the article (to restore from time-machine) will not work.  \nA Time Machine restore will reformat your hard drive to match the case sensitivity of the backup.  The only way that I've found to fix this so far is either a clean install (because you have all day and nothing better to do), or iPartition from Coriolis Software.  It's about $50, but saved me countless hours of frustration.  Some other software also doesn't like case sensitive file systems (e.g. Steam).  There may be other software out there to convert the case sensitivity of an HFS+ volume, but I couldn't find any.   \n\nA: Roadkill's fix worked, but it doesn't explain what caused this problem in my case. \nI had been happily using a case-sensitive 10.10.5 system (both Mac OS X and Office 2011 fully patched) for many years. Then the print menu changed just like the OP. I did NOT just install a new system or reformat my drive. I checked TM backups going back, and even in my oldest backup from 2 yrs ago, they all have the lower-case i which shouldn't work. However, I am sure that in the past 2 years (in fact, in the past 2 weeks) I have definitely used the extended print options. None of this makes sense. :( \n", "Q: How can I deactivate iCloud to avoid \"MobileMe Services Stopped Working\" message?

I´ve tried all the remedies listed here in the forum from resets to experimenting with pmset settings.\nShould my MacBook sleep as soon as I close the lid just like pressing alt+cmd+eject or does it sleep according to the power settings? I.e. after 10 minutes if so set?\nHere is the output of pmset -g\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1*\nAC Power        -1\nCurrently in use:\n standbydelay         4200\n standby              0\n halfdim              1\n sms                  1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n disksleep            10\n sleep                10\n hibernatemode        3\n ttyskeepawake        1\n displaysleep         1\n acwake               0\n lidwake              1\n\nUsing syslog | grep -i \"wake reason\" gives no results?\nI have reviewed my sharing settings and deactivated everything, checked that there is no print queue and bluetooth is off.\nCan anyone help me get my MacBook to sleep when I close the lid?\n\nA: First thing - if \"Internet sharing\" is on and you are connected to power your Macbook won't sleep, though it does turn the display off.\nTo start can we make sure that the computer will actually sleep.\nSelect \"Sleep\" in the Apple menu. Now wake the computer. Note the time. Do the same thing again ten minutes later but this time sleep the computer, close the lid, wait a couple of minutes then open it. Note the time again. Does this wake the computer?\nI like to open Console rather than use the syslog so run Console and select \"All Messages\" under \"System Log Queries\". Now we can search in the log easily for both \"wake\" and \"sleep\". \nWhen looking at the results for \"wake\" you should see some kernel messages that tell you either it waked due to a lid open \"EC.LidOpen\" or you touched the keyboard which will log a kernel message \"The USB device Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad (Port 2 of Hub at 0xfa100000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (3)\"\nWhen looking for \"sleep\" the most interesting lines are those that log the AirPort power change as they mark actual system sleeps. If you have \"Power Nap\" turned on the  you will also see kernel messages logged by RTC for \"Maintenance\" and \"SleepService\" which tells you that at time the computer was asleep but partially woke up for RTC to do it's thing.\nFor sleep though the best to look for is a message from WindowServer \"handle_will_sleep_auth_and_shield_windows: Deferring\" which it logs at sleep time.\nWhat does 'pmset -g assertions' give you? Are there any lines set to '1'?\nGiven all that what do you learn about how your computer is sleeping and waking?\nIf it doesn't wake on a lid open perhaps you have a hardware problem?\n\nA: Do you have anything connected to the MiniDisplay port? My MacBook won't sleep on closing the lid if I've got an AV adapter connected.\n\nA: After a lot of testing on the mother board i found that if you have a faulty battery indicator, or if the battery indicator plug on the mother board is not connected or has come undone, your apple and screen will not go to sleep when closed. this is the plug next to the battery connector on the mother board.\n\nA: This answer is specific to Macbook Air.  Mine is a 13\" mid2012, but this should apply to most models of the Air, and may apply to MBP from similar timeframe as well.\nOnce you have tried these software and OS fixes, if nothing works, you may have a fault in your I/O board.  This is the board that connects the power, iSight camera, microphone, headphones, and one USB port to the logic board.\nIt also holds the sensor that can tell when your laptop closes.\nTake a small refrigerator magnet and run it along the side of your keyboard near the port for the magsafe charger.  You are trying to find the lid sensor.  When you see the screen go dark, you've found the sensor.  Leave the magnet right over that spot.  If your I/O board is in good shape, the display will stay dark.  If your screen flickers on and off, your I/O is faulty and should be replaced.\nIt's a $50-80 board, and with a pentalobe 5 and small hex star driver, replacing the board is fairly easy.  There is a good how-to at ifixit.com\nAfter weeks of trying to track down a software issue, I did this replacement myself and it solved the problem right away and for good.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I got my MacBook to sleep again when I disabled automatic backups with Time Machine. \n\nA: In my case the answer was battery indicator module. In fact I didn't have that module at all so after buying one and placing it in the right place (under the battery on the side where battery indicator button is placed of course) the issue was solved and sleep mode worked in a normal way by closing the lid. So try replacing the module, it's not expensive.

This support document tells you how.\nFrom there I would start by then connecting a Mac using Ethernet and seeing if you can get it connected to the 'net. \nFirst would be to establish that the Extreme is handing out IP addresses via DHCP. When you look in System Preferences > Network the Mac should have an IP address from the Express (probably 10.0.. or 192.168..), not a 169...* self assigned IP.\nThen can you ping the Extreme from the Mac. Then can you ping your modem. Finally, can you ping \"www.google.com\" (which will also show that you have DNS working).\nIf any of that breaks then check the settings on the Extreme until it does and you should be good.\n", "Q: iMAC Late 2009 - Only boots in Safe Mode iMAC Late 2009 - Gets stuck on Grey Screen with Apple Logo.\nOnly way to boot it is in Safe Mode\nRan Apple Hardware Test (Extended) - Came out Clean\nDid Hard Drive Verify - No Issues\nI have Reset PRAM\nOut of ideas?\n\nA: I had to take it to a Mac Repair Shop.

It is early 2011 model.\nI upgraded to OS X 10.9 when it was released. Since then the boot and shutdown time has been extended greatly. What used to be a few seconds to shut down now takes like up-to a minute. I also don't use many apps or graphic intensive processes. But still when I launch VLC or certain apps the fan spins really fast and the apps themselves take quite a while to start. I even started thinking of going back to Snow Leopard. But after using the new features for a while now, am really doubtful of what I would do without them.\nIs there any remedy to reduce these long waits and increase the performance? Like install any app or updates.\nHas anyone had a similar experience and rectified it?\n\nA: Maybe this isn't the answer you wanted to hear, and maybe also it's my paranoia about RAM (I made sure my new rMBP maxed out at 16 GB, particularly because RAM is now soldered to the motherboard), but the fact is that it's the cheapest upgrade possible on your computer. When you don't have enough RAM, the performance hit you take, when the computer starts paging to the hard drive, is simply monstrous.\nHonestly I think 4 GB of RAM, today, is on the low side. Only the lowest end Macs currently for sale feature 4 GB of RAM, and some come with 16 GB standard. Mavericks has a compressed memory feature that should supposedly help with RAM pressure, but there's only so much that can be done. Your computer can certainly use 8 GB of RAM and most likely 16 GB of RAM, as reported here. I just checked Newegg and you can get 2 x 4GB RAM modules (for a total of 8 GB) of RAM for about $70 and 2 x 8GB for about $140 (reputable brands in both cases).\nThen there's the possibility of replacing your hard drive with an SSD, but that's a much more expensive upgrade, and RAM should help a lot already. If you plan on staying with this computer for a long time, it's a possibility you definitely should consider since it breathes new life into any computer with a mechanical HDD. Also, prices are constantly falling, so if a RAM upgrade helps you now, you can hold out for a bit and get a good deal on an SSD later.\nIf it helps you somehow, I can happily report my previous computer, a mid-2010 15\" MBP with 8 GB of RAM and a 300 GB SSD, absolutely flies with Mavericks installed, and I consider myself a fairly heavy user, including Parallels running most of the time. Most apps opened within a single Dock bounce. My wife needed a better computer and I needed more disk space (my average free space on the last few months was 10 GB or so), so I ended up ordering a retina MBP. But I can assure you that, other than the disk space problem, I could easily keep using that computer for another couple of years, it was just that fast.\n", "Q: Weird Google Chrome errors in system.log I'm using Mavericks and Google Chrome Version 34.0.1797.2 dev.\nThis is the error I receive:\nJan 25 17:09:12 genesis Google Chrome Helper[46267]: Process unable to create connection because the sandbox denied the right to lookup com.apple.coreservices.launchservicesd and so this process cannot talk to launchservicesd. : LSXPCClient.cp #426 `___ZN26LSClientToServerConnection21setupServerConnectionEiPK14__CFDictionary_block_invoke()` q=com.apple.main-thread\nJan 25 17:09:12 genesis Google Chrome Helper[46267]: Process unable to create connection because the sandbox denied the right to lookup com.apple.coreservices.launchservicesd and so this process cannot talk to launchservicesd.\nJan 25 17:09:12 genesis Google Chrome Helper[46267]: CGSLookupServerRootPort: Failed to look up the port for \"com.apple.windowserver.active\" (1100)\n\nAny idea on what might be causing this? I've googled around and found no clue...\n\nA: As you may know Google Chrome runs as a multi-process application. You have your initial \"Google Chrome\" process that manages the UI and plays \"host\" to a number of other processes. A new \"renderer\" process is created for each tab you open in Chrome, a \"plugin\" process for each extension you install, and there is a separate \"GPU\" process for the code that talks to the system's GPU. Each of these other processes appears in Activity Monitor as a \"Google Chrome Helper\" process.\nTo make Chrome more secure, the renderer processes run in a sandbox. They are only able to talk to the network through the host process and can only talk to specific files (for example, fonts and ColorSync profiles). They are also prevented from talking to other processes in the system, which is what causes these log messages. The renderer processes are trying to talk to the launchserviced and windowservice processes, but being prevented from doing that because of their sandbox.\nThis bug was resolved by a software engineer on Google's Chrome Security team with a commit in February 2014. Removing this one line of code resolved the problem.\n[NSApplication sharedApplication];\nAmongst other things, calling the sharedApplication method opens a connection between an application and OS X's WindowServer, which you can see failing in the CGSLookupServerRootPort error.\nThe intention was for Chrome to call this method to \"warm up\" certain resources before enabling the sandbox; gaining access to certain files, processes or network resources before the sandbox restrictions fell in place. However it seems that at some point this attempt started failing, resulting in these errors in the log. My guess is that Apple considered this \"warming up\" an attempt to cheat the sandbox and started clamping down on it.\nIf I'm reading correctly this change reached the stable release channel with an update of Google Chrome to 34.0.1847.131 in April 2014.\nInterestingly the Chrome team had been discussing removing these calls to the sharedApplication method back in October 2013 and even discussed removing Cocoa entirely from the renderer processes as a goal back in 2009.\nOn a related note, Apple released a security fix in April 2014 to resolve a bug where \"WindowServer sessions could be created by sandboxed applications.\"\n", "Q: Chrome Page Monitor equivalent for ipad Is there an equivalent to Page Monitor or an app for iOS?

I want this behavior:\nThe screen should never lock while I'm on a voice call, no matter how long I'm talking.  \nAfter the call is over, it should return to its normal behavior, locking after X minutes of inactivity or when I click the top button to turn the screen off.\nCan this be achieved?\n\nA: This bugged me for a while. I just found out that (on my phone anyway) if you slide your finger from left to right on the name of the caller, you will see your call menu again.\n\nA: I  agree with the frustration.  If I am on a conference call on mute, and someone asks me a questions, I have to unlock my phone first before I can unmute.  During such time, I hear people on the other end of the call asking I am still on the line.  \nMentioning that the lock/passcode and time limits is enforced by my employer - this is a company owned phone. I cannot change the settings.\nIt would be ideal to have the phone lock during a call but no passcode protected.\n\nA: To summarize in an actual answer: no, this feature has not been included in iOS - as of iOS 7. \nAs you are aware, the proximity sensor disables the screen when the phone is close to your ear (to avoid accidentally selecting options on the screen, and reduce battery drain), and you can choose to have the phone auto-lock after X number of minutes, but these two features do not work together at all. \nPerhaps a somewhat plausible workaround would be to have your passcode, if applicable, only engage after a set amount of lock-time. That way, at least you wouldn't have to enter in your passcode to resume activity on the device after a phone call.\nOtherwise, unfortunately, like many other things on iOS, there is remarkably little \"hacking\" or workarounds that are available unless you decide to jailbreak your phone.\n\nA: I've just updated from iOS5 to iOS7 and this is a major drawback. A 3 swipe process to hang up a call is fundamentally flawed IMO.\nYou can hangup by hitting the power button. This doesn't help if you're on 'mute' in a teleconference though.\n", "Q: How to get Mac App Store to stop thinking app is installed on external drive? I ran into a problem where the Mac App Store said that a particular app (Numbers in this case) was up to date, but whenever I launched it I would get an older version.  I finally did a search across the entire computer and found Numbers.app in a folder on an external drive.  I have no idea how or why it was installed there instead of on the local hard drive. So I moved it from there to the Applications folder on the main internal drive and re-created the dock shortcut and now the correct version launches.\nThe problem is, now when I go to the App Store it says there is a new update available.  So it appears that the App Store wants to use the external drive location and now that I deleted it from there it wants to put it back.  Obviously I don't want this to happen: first of all, if the external drive goes away I would lose the app, and second, every time there is an upgrade it is going to cause more problems.\nSo, how do I get the App Store to correctly recognize that Numbers is installed in /Applications, not on the external drive?\n\nA: Figures I found someone else that runs into the same problem as myself and no one has answered with a solution yet.\nWhat I can offer is a work around for now until someone chimes in with a better fix, because I have an external drive that I use as backup by cloning my OS X partition. So when I decide to format and reinstall fresh I run into the same problem as you except I can't even install the apps because it says they're already installed.\nSimple and Quick - Just disconnect the drive and restart the App Store, it will refresh with the correct information.\n-Idea's I've been kicking around, but have not given it much more thought or a go.\nI was going to make the drive hidden by putting a \".\" as the first character of the partition name, but I kept running into another problem (can't remember).\nAnyways I hope this will work for you since anytime I've ever ran into the issue i've always resolved it by disconnecting the drive. \nGood Luck!\n-Mac\n", "Q: Macbook Pro (Mid 2009) will not turn on without power cord [new battery installed] I have recently purchased and installed a new battery for my Mid 2009 13 inch Macbook Pro but have not been able to turn on the laptop without the power supply since the new battery has been installed.

Copy the entire contents of the Address Book folder from the backup and overwrite the contents of this folder on your system drive.\nOnce the copy is complete, relaunch Address Book and you should see your contacts listed, current as of the date of your last backup.\nNote that in this case, the listener had performed a clean installation of OS X and her Time Machine backup was no longer linked to her system.

I would like it to be my hub computer. I would like to have the functionality of a laptop or desktop with the advantages of mobility - touch-screen, portability, connectivity.\nThere is some talk of a computer which combines the functionality of the Macbook (the Apple notebook-name??) and an iPad, a convertible. But that possibility is a year to a year and a half away, if at all, of course.\nI've been delving into the possibilities of use of the iPad Air with peripherals and am having some success, and some mixed results.\nUse of an external hard drive seems to be a real possibility both from Apple and third-party makers also (the Voyager Air external hard drive-www.corsair.com/external hard drives by Seagate/I believe Apple's product is Time Capsule). But not only do I want storage, I want to work with apps and programs on the external hard drive, due to the limited space of the Apple iPad Air.\nI want to have the full range of the use of some of the important peripherals. I've found an external hard drive, Mobilelite Wireless (www.kingston.com), which stores nothing, but has USB 2 port, USB 3 being preferable, of course, SD/SDHC/ SDXC slot, and an adapter for micro SD cards.\nIn my reading, I've come across some things that allude to apps, Apple apps, which enabled, or helped an external device to function with the iPad Air.\n\nA: Apps can't be stored on an external drive1. In fact, not much outside of media can be stored externally, especially without jailbreaking.\nWith jailbreaking, you can mount the external drive as a volume with iFile, which lets you store files on there. However, many apps crash when attempting to access files stored outside a sandbox by means of symlinking due to security restrictions.\nBasically, it's nowhere as simple as external drives with OS X. You won't be able to do much with an external drive, and even less if you don't jailbreak.\nThe iPad Camera Connection kit with its SD card reader and USB port was not designed for storing files from the iPad — it was designed to import media from a camera. There are specially-designed drives for iOS devices, but they're for storing media, not apps or app data.\n1 Well, jailbreaking lets you move the app and move it back, but it can't be run from the external drive, and moving it will probably break the permissions (and springboard).\n", "Q: Various random website cannot be reached (cannot allocate memory) With process of elimination and testing the problems on 2 different Macs, 4 different networks, and many different browsers, I have isolated the cause of my network issue to be the actual Mac.\nCertain sites, even though they are up, are completely unreachable by one of my Mac.

Still no idea why it happens or why this fixes it, but seems to work for me and is much faster than rebooting. \n", "Q: Free screen grabber for OS X I'm looking for an app that lets me capture a rectangle, puts it up to an image bin, and puts a link to the image into my clipboard.\nDropbox does this, with one problem: it doesn't link to the image. It links to a page containing the image, but it isn't trivial to extract the image from the link.\nThe reason I want a link to the image is because I use IRC, and most good IRC clients are smart enough that if I enter the URL for an image, the other users of the channel Will see the image. However, if it is linking to a page containing the image then that is no good: they will just see a web link and they will have to click it, and it will open up a new browser window, and that annoys people.\nI've also checked out Jing which is very nice, only it suffers the same problem.\nEDIT: I started writing a script https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21371254/osx-automatically-upload-screenshot-to-imagebin-and-put-url-in-clipboard\nSo far it uploads file, puts a link into the clipboard and make some noise. Can anyone finish it off?\n\nA: If you have ssh access to some server, you might use a script like this:\nf=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).png\nscreencapture -i ~/Sites/upload/$f\nprintf %s http://example.com/$f|pbcopy\nscp ~/Sites/upload/$f user@host:public_html\n\nTo make scp not require a password, run ssh-keygen, accept the defaults in every step, and then run ssh user@host 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh/;chmod 700 ~/.ssh/;cat>>~/.ssh/authorized_keys;chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'<~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\n\nA: GrabBox\nUnless there's been an update recently, this software did have some minor usability bugs the last time I checked it, but it does actually satisfy your requirements.\nBasically, it still uses the built-in screenshot capabilities of command-shift-3 and command-shift-4, and the hosting capability of Dropbox, but it drops the files into your Public folder and gives you a direct link to the image.\n\nA: There is an app for that on the App Store:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cloud https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cloud/id417602904?mt=12\nI use it quite often and also Skitch and Dropbox can be convinced to do similar tricks.\n\nA: Although not quite \"automatic\", you could create a symbolic link from ~/Dropbox/Screenshots to a subdirectory in your ~/Dropbox/Public folder. This will redirect your screenshots into your Public folder hierarchy.\nWhen you right click to get public URLs from inside your Public folder, the URLs are direct (to the images in this case) rather than to a page containing the image.\nIn this case, your screenshot will go directly to Dropbox, but the URL automatically copied to the clipboard won't be the one you want to use. You'll have to grab the correct URL yourself.\n", "Q: Create a New Space in Mavericks using Applescript In Mavericks, is it possible to use Applescript to create a new Space in Mission Control?\nI also tried the following code to switch to another Space, but it does not seem to do anything...\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Finder\"\n        keystroke \"2\" using control down --switches to space 2\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: delay 0.5 -- time to release command if the script is run with command-R\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 126 using control down -- control-up\n    delay 1\n    do shell script \"MouseTools -x 1900 -y 60;sleep 1;MouseTools -leftClickNoRelease;MouseTools -releaseMouse\"\n    key code 53 -- escape\nend tell\n\nYou can download MouseTools from http://www.hamsoftengineering.com/codeSharing/MouseTools/MouseTools.html.

My only plugins as far as I know are Mail Act-On and MailTags. Does this functionality comes from them? I could not find anything on their website.

My daughter was using my Apple ID with her Ipad mini. I want her to use her own Apple ID now that she is old enough. How can we transfer the content of her ipad mini, ( music, photos, apps) particularly game apps WITH THEIR DATA onto her new account? She doesn't want to start from scratch with all her games.\n\nA: You cannot. It's not possible to share content from one Apple ID to another. Apple actually recommends everyone have their own Apple ID.\nYou can load the content on your daughter's device and she can access them all normally. You can then log her into her own Apple ID, where she can begin to make her purchases on her own account. The only downside is she will have to know your Apple ID's password as iOS will ask for it on rare occasions (when restoring the device for example). It's possible to store content from multiple Apple accounts on a single device, the user will just need to enter the password should the OS ever require it. That is the only feasible solution in your case (other than starting over). This will at least circumvent having to re-purchase any content.\nThis has always been a sore spot for Apple customers as they have historically been very firm in never being able to even close an Apple ID, let alone share content between them.\nYou can read more about Apple IDs here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5622?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: With the release of iOS 8, you can. \nThere is a new feature called family sharing which allows you sync purchases from 1 apple ID to another. You could set up a family with your daughter where she can re-download her games. \nIf she wants her data (progress ect.) you could use apps like iFunBox to extract the data and transfer it to another iPhone.\n\nA: If all the paid applications associated with your Apple ID is for your daughter then give her your Apple ID and create another Apple ID for yourself. Do not worry about your free applicationS as you can purchase them again for free in your new Apple ID.\n\nA: in iOS 8 you can turn on family sharing on your account and hers and she can download her games from your shared apps.\n", "Q: How do I enter chinese names in Address Book? Chinese names are quite elaborate and quite different from the \"standard American name\" that the Mac Address Book is based on.\nNotably I'm looking for a good way to\n\n\n*\n\n*Store a person's Chinese name – an alias written in Chinese characters.\n\n*Store a person's western alias in addition to their transliterated Chinese name.\n\n*Minimize duplicate contact issues (via sync and social network imports) that can't easily be de-duplicated through the Look for Duplicates... command.\n\n\nThis is somewhat related to How do I enter Dutch names in Address Book? but for people who wants to file details of their PRC and Chinese diaspora contacts.\n\nA: Go to Keyboard Preference Pane.There are four tabs there. Select Input Sources. Click the + button located at the bottom of the language sidebar. Select Chinese language from there. You can also switch languages with the \"Show input menu in the menu bar\".\n\n\nA: I normally store the western aliases as \"nickname\".\n", "Q: How do I determine what is waking my machine up? Recently my Macbook Pro has been waking up from sleep at undesirable times (middle of the night) without any user interaction (nobody has touched it).\nIs there a log on the machine that records the reason a machine woke from sleep?\nApparently the machine wakes up because:\n1/26/14, 1:21:20 AM PST  Wake  Wake [CDNVA] due to EHC1/HID Activity: Using AC (Charge:99%)\n\nWhat is [CDNVA] due to EHC1/HID Activity: Using AC (Charge:99%)?\n\nA: You can run pmset -g log to see a log of power events:\n$ pmset -g log|grep Wake|tail\n1/25/14, 13:50:42 GMT+2  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None\n1/25/14, 15:16:52 GMT+2  Wake                   Wake [CDNVA] due to XHC1/HID Activity: Using AC\nSleep/Wakes since boot at 1/24/14, 20:39:59 GMT+2  :2   Dark Wake Count in this sleep cycle:0\n1/25/14, 22:48:51 GMT+2  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None\n1/25/14, 23:23:12 GMT+2  Wake                   Wake [CDNVA] due to XHC1/HID Activity: Using AC                             4397 secs\nSleep/Wakes since boot at 1/24/14, 20:39:59 GMT+2  :3   Dark Wake Count in this sleep cycle:0\n1/26/14, 0:36:29 GMT+2   Sleep                  Software Sleep pid=45 to DarkWake: Using AC\n1/26/14, 0:38:34 GMT+2   WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None\n1/26/14, 9:54:42 GMT+2   Wake                   Wake [CDNVA] due to XHC1/HID Activity: Using AC\nTotal Sleep/Wakes since boot at 1/24/14, 20:39:59 GMT+2  :5\n\nIf your Mac supports Power Nap, you could try to disable Power Nap from System Preferences.\n\nA: You can find a lot of information in the system log.\nOpen the Console utility and this will allow you to easily search the system log for \"sleep\" and \"wake\".\nThe information is not easy to understand but if you do find some lines in the system log you can't understand feel free to update your question.\nEHC1 is usually something to do with a USB device. Do you have an external drive attached to the machine? Is it powered via USB?\n\nA: EHC is Enhanced Host Controller. It's a USB interface, similar to OHC. However EHC can also be wireless devices and Bluetooth since they are also on the USB bus of a Mac.\nHID is a Human Interface Device, such as mice/keyboards. Bluetooth HID could be the culprit.\nTry disconnecting all USB and Bluetooth devices, and turn off Airport, then attempt to sleep it.\n\nA: Go to Activity Monitor and click View, Columns, make sure Prevent Sleep is checked and then look for what shows up that is listed. \n", "Q: Desktop icons are disappearing & not behaving I've just been attempting to shift some stuff across to an external hardrive to make space on the laptop HD and all was going well until I tried copying a large amount of photos into a folder on the desktop and then it all went bonkers.\nOne of the symptoms of this curious affliction is that if one is to attempt to create a new folder on the desktop, it works but is invisible. Another involves clicking the mouse on one icon, only to have opened the app/doc/program relevant to an icon either to the sides or above the clicked icon.\n\nA: I had a similar problem where icons would stay when files were deleted on the Desktop.\nI ran AppleJack to clear the caches and it went away.

Is there any way to make the Terminal displayed with different profile? Better still, is there a way to recognize the login access to display with different profile automatically?\n\nA: By \"Profile\" I assume you mean the different profiles defined in the Terminal preferences under \"Settings\"?\nIf so, modify, duplicate, or create whatever profile you want to use when connecting to the remote server. Under the \"Shell\" tab of the profile, set the command to run to be whatever ssh command you give to log into the remote server. Uncheck the \"Run inside shell\". Now, whenever you open that profile under the \"Shell\" menu of Terminal, it will launch the remote connection. If you want even more automation, assign a keyboard shortcut for that profile in the Keyboard preferences of System Preferences.\n\n\nIf you are looking to have this happen when you type an ssh command, there are two alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a shell function to execute an osascript (AppleScript) prior to the ssh command (see this other answer).\n\n*Use something like tput setab <n>; clear in your remote .bashrc file. See background coloring for values to use for n. Note that this will not persist if you embed escape codes in your prompt that reset colors or if you do something else that resets terminal colors. This will also linger after logging out, but that can be fixed with similar escape codes. It's not really changing the \"Profile\", but you might get the effect you are looking for.\n\n", "Q: minimum MacBook and specs required for iOS development I have this early 2008 MacBook 13\" which only is upgradeable to 10.7.5.\nI checked on the app store and it says Xcode requires OSX version 10.8.4 Mountain Lion and later. Although this page from Apple Dev Center says the requirement is Snow Leopard 10.6.8 and later.\nIs this MacBook sufficient for iOS development,and if so, what iOS version does it support?\n\nA: If you want to develop apps for iOS 7 or later, you need to have the Xcode 5+ with Mountain Lion or Mavericks. Snow Leopard or later is required to run Xcode 4+. \n\n\n*\n\n*Xcode 4+ == iOS 5, 6\n\n*Xcode 5+ == iOS 6, 7\n\n\nA: Incorrect. You need the latest Xcode if you're going to submit the app to the app store. If you're developing for personal use or to learn, Pratik's advice is okay. If you're going to develop and ship, you'll need a friend who can run the most recent Xcode.\n", "Q: How do I change shells (bash to ksh) on OS 10.9.1?

Some consider it good form to preserve what AppleScript's text item delimiters were before changing them, then restore them back to original settings, instead of assuming that was a null character (\"\"), especially if this might run while other scripts are running, since it is a global property. \ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set theSenderList to {}\n    set theMessages to the selected messages of message viewer 0\n    repeat with aMessage in theMessages\n        set oneAddress to extract address from sender of aMessage\n        set end of theSenderList to oneAddress\n        say \"found: \" & oneAddress\n    end repeat\n    set {prevDelims, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to {AppleScript's text item delimiters, \" \"}\n    set the clipboard to (theSenderList as string)\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to prevDelims\nend tell\n\n\nA: An update to Matthieu's answer, to remove duplicates and add a new line between each address:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set theSenderList to {}\n    set theMessages to the selected messages of message viewer 0\n    repeat with aMessage in theMessages\n        set theSender to sender of aMessage\n        if theSender is not in theSenderList then\n            set end of theSenderList to theSender\n            set end of theSenderList to \"\n\"\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\n    set the clipboard to (theSenderList as rich text)\n    beep\nend tell\n\n", "Q: All apps wiped from jailbroken iPhone (iOS 7.0.4) after reboot from battery loss Basically I have my iPhone w/ iOS 7.0.4 jailbroken using the latest evasion software. \nI recently ran out of battery, and when I had managed to recharge and get my handset back on, all of my apps (apart from the stock apps that come with the phone) are all gone. No other data is missing, e.g , music, pictures and videos. \nWhen I go to, settings, general, and usage. I can clearly see that my memory is still being taken up by all the apps I \"had\" on my phone (2.1gb free) yet the apps still aren't there. I'm usually good with tech, especially Apple. But this one has me stumped.\n\nA: It's a bug. Your apps aren't gone but just not visible on your Home Screen.\nTo restore them, reinstall a package through Cydia (either an existing one, or a new one will suffice). Then either respring (can be achieved via WinterBoard) or reboot your device (unnecessary if you reinstall a package that requires SpringBoard to restart, like ClassicDock for example).\nI have unfortunately not been able to pin down the exact cause of this.\n\nA: This is the third time I've had this issue: the very first time I ended up restoring my iPad. The second time it happened I ended up re-downloading all the apps but noticed that the apps that were in the folders were getting downloaded but also re-creating the same folders that they were in and going in there. \nI now found I solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download iFile from Cydia   \n\n*Navigate to /var/mobile/Library/Caches and delete com.apple.mobile.installation.plist\n\n*Shutdown the iPad by holding down the power button and then swiping it to power off  \n\n*Reboot\n*If deleting that file did not work, try also deleting 'com.apple.mobile.installation_backup.plist'*\n\n\nThis method is the fastest way to restore the missing apps. It restores also the data in those apps. Note: (the folders will not be restored only the apps). It works only if you lost your apps during reboot/restart (bug).\n\nA: If you have SSH access to your device (as mobile user), run uicache then respring.  \nThe command provides no Terminal output once complete, just wait for the prompt to return then respring. It takes a few seconds to carry out the command.\n\nA: For me ipad 2 ios 7.4 after 2 Times of this fritz led to to rejailbreak 2 I uninstalled cydia substrate removing every tweak did I get my icons back! I think it's scrambled or broken extensions to lib hide but really it's all still forced together! \n\nA: I know this will be a pain for all iOS people( me included ) but I worked out that if I just left my iPhone (4 iOS 7.0.4) alone for a while it would do a respring or something that looked like a respring at least then all my apps wer back. I wonder if it could be a substrate bug coz before sauric updated it I did the same thing so if anyone knows more about the substrate u might want to look into it\n", "Q: Is the logo on the back of the iPhone 5S a mirror like on the iPhone 4S?

Is the logo on the back of the (silver) iPhone 5S a mirror as well?\n\nA: As you can see in this video : Yes it's the case on all 3 models. \nWith the iPhone 5, it's was only the case with the white model. \n\nA: Another tip to add. Slightly less convenient tho. You can always open the camera from the lockscreen, and use the front facing camera as a mirror. \n", "Q: Wifi doesn't work unless I turn it off then on again I have a MacBook Pro 15\" with retina display that I use for work/personal stuff and I always shut down with Wifi having been on. When I startup my Mac the Wifi icon looks like it's searching and never actually connects (most of the time). To get it to connect I have to turn of Wifi (on my MacBook, not the router) and turn it back on, then it connects pretty much right away. What's the issue here? It's very annoying.\n\nA: What actually helped was to reset the SMC and reset the PRAM. Now the Mac connects instantly to the WiFi.\nLater edit: It looks like the problem is caused by interference from Bluetooth signals and your WiFi device. Because it connected much faster with Bluetooth off. I changed to a 5Ghz network on another WiFi AP and I had no problems since.\nThe following are all suggestions I've tried from different sources:\n\n\n*\n\n*moving preferred network to top\n\n*clearing all WiFi passwords (including those from the keychain) and reconnecting only to the preferred network\n\n*disabling bluetooth\n\n*forcefully removing network configuration files\n\n*adding a fixed DNS server\n\nA: Try this Golang script out  - https://github.com/icecrasher321/Wifi_Hack\nThe script automates the process of turning off and on your wifi at intervals of 20 minutes(Future versions will detect packet drops to start the wifi reset process). You can keep it running in the background. More information is available in the README of the github link given above.\nIf you don't want to install Golang just for this, you can get the same result by using the following shell script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile :; do\n    networksetup -setairportpower en1 off\n    sleep 3\n    networksetup -setairportpower en1 on\n    sleep $((20 * 60))\ndone\n\nRun networksetup -listallhardwareports first to check whether your Wi-Fi really is on en1 .\n\nA: Old preferences hanging around after upgrade can cause issues.

Install the version for your OS at http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/download.xhtml\n\nA: In my case, the only thing I found to actually fix the problem was to change country settings in my router to USA. \nRouters and Wireless interfaces have different \"profiles\" for different world region due to regulations that change between country to country.\nIn my case I suspect that someone have some buggy implementation on their side (maybe my router, maybe my MacBook Pro). \n\nA: Look at your antivirus settings , i had to check my settings on avast (antivirus program) and realized that a \" web shield \" was enabled , once i disabled it . Web pages started loading. Ps : i was a few days without loading webpages on my laptop before trying this. I hope this helps :)\n\nA: I wrote this script that checks for internet every 20 seconds then restarts the wifi network adapter if it is offline. You may have to change your adapter from en0 depending on which one your WIFI device uses\n#!/bin/bash\n\n    while :; do\n\n    echo -e \"GET http://google.com HTTP/1.0\\n\\n\" | nc google.com 80 > /dev/null 2>&1\n\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"Online\"\n    else\n        echo \"Offline\"\n        networksetup -setairportpower en0 off\n        sleep 3\n        networksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n    fi\n\n        sleep $((20*1`))\n    done\n\n\nA: I had been having issues with my internet on my late model 2015 MacbookPro for months and turned off the Bluetooth and the difference was night and day. I have about 6 different devices that the Bluetooth has been connected to on and off over the course of two years. I recently had it serviced at Apple for another issue where the PRAM was reset and saw no change.

They don't happen at the same intervals (sometimes it happens after an hour, sometimes four), but they always happen. Since upgrading to Mavericks I've had to do this whole put-the-computer-to-sleep thing several times a day. This did not happen under Mountain Lion.\nI've tried the following things, without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n*Deleted ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.bluetooth.* and /Library/Preferences/com.apple.bluethooth and anything else related to Bluetooth\n\n*Reinstalled Mavericks\n\n*Had the physical Bluetooth controller replaced by Apple (just got the computer back yesterday)\n\n\nDespite all this, the problem persists. I still have to put the computer to sleep 4–5 times a day to get the mouse and keyboard working again. Seemingly nobody knows how to fix it—it has even stumped Apple.\nDoes anyone know what's going on?\n\nA: I was able to overcome the problem with this quick fix. So whenever you loose bluetooth connectivity just run the following commands in the terminal\n$ sudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\n$ sudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\n\nYou will regain connectivity.\n\nA: I had the same issues and I was able to fix it by deleting the bluetooth settings as Andrew suggested in 3, in combination with also killing the preference cache (see http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57617236-263/how-to-tackle-defaults-not-sticking-in-mavericks/). Without killing the cache daemon, I wasn't able to solve the problem. So here's what I did:\nrm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\nkillall -u yourusername cfprefsd\n\nIf I remember correctly, I issued both commands multiple times to make sure all Bluetooth settings.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I have the same issue routinely. I solve it by opening the \"Activity Monitor\", Selecting the \"kextd\" process under the CPU tab, and quitting the process. It will immediately restart and bluetooth connectivity is restored. This is more of a workaround than a fix but is quick and effective for me.\n\n\nA: My Airpods Pro would not connect to my Mac. The above solutions did not work for me. Seeing this in the console:\ndefault 11:35:44.718199-0500    bluetoothd  found name string in EIR! it is: Christopher‚Äôs AirPods Pro\nI noticed the funny characters that appeared instead of the ' (apostrophe) that was expected. It should have read Christopher's AirPods Pro.\nI was able to connect the airpods to my phone. Using my phone I changed the name of the Airpods to \"Chris Airpods\". Hoping this name change might stick across my icloud connected devices.\nSure enough, after the name change I was able to connect to them on my mac.  Might not have had anything to do with the non-letter character, maybe just re-naming refreshed some cache, I don't know. But it worked. Previously it had failed with error: default  11:35:48.566256-0500    com.apple.preferences.Bluetooth.remoteservice   Pairing with Christopher’s AirPods Pro failed with e00002d7\n\nA: My bluetooth speakers kept connecting and dropping every 15 - 30 seconds (Macbook Pro retina). Speakers were fine, tried them on iphone.\nTried all the other suggested fixes, Reset PRAM, reset bluetooth module, run scripts but nothing worked. I found a fix though.\nTurn off your bluetooth device. Pair your mac with your iPhone. No connection required, it said it wasn't supported. Then reconnect to bluetooth device (speakers). Connection has yet to drop. Good luck.\n\nA: My it helps you to reset the SMC (System Management Controller), as the SMC is responsible for all components that are associated with power supply and, according to an Apple Store Genuis, a SMC reset would reset the bluetooth chip as well.\n(Here is the link to Apples Support Page with a tutorial to reset the SMC)\n", "Q: Is there any way to get iPad Safari Youtube videos to play at a higher (HD) quality? I like to watch educational videos (like Udacity) which are hosted on Youtube.  However, when I watch these on my iPad 2 over Wifi, they always play back at the lowest quality!  The quality is so bad that I can't even read the code on the screen!\nThese same videos on the same Wifi connection play in HD on a PC.\nSearching for each individual video from the Youtube app is obviously not an option - that process would take almost as long as the video itself.  Is there some way to get Youtube within Safari to play at a reasonable resolution?\n\nA: I don't know what the actual answer is, but I am having the same issue.  The page https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/AudioandVideoTagBasics/AudioandVideoTagBasics.html\nhas some good info.

Video is not presented within the webpage. The height and width attributes affect only the space allotted on the webpage, and the controls attribute is ignored. This is true only for Safari on devices with small screens. On Mac OS X, Windows, and iPad, Safari plays video inline, embedded in the webpage.\"  - Which, I believe, means on the iPad, that the video plays at the resolution of the initial window (determined by the programmer), and does not naturally play on the YoutTube player, or at a higher res if you enlarge the video.\nThis seems to be the \"problem\" that we're encountering - that its a \"feature\" specific to Safari on the iPad.  Why they do this, I dunno.  In my case, the video plays at a higher res (and better) on my smaller iPhone than does on my iPad mini with Retna.  Go figure.  \nI came upon this post, hoping to find the answer and a work around.  If you get the Youtube app, and find the video through that, it will play at the highest resolution, but not through Safari.  So far as I can tell.\nEnjoy\n\nA: You might want to check your YouTube account preferences for playback quality.\nSee here:\n\nTry checking the \"Always play HD on fullscreen\" option. If you use the YouTube app you may also want to check the apps setting for this as well.\nIf that doesn't work, it might be because the iPad screen is of retina quality and the YouTube video is not scaled well. Perhaps the video is only 480p or something of the sort. Of course if the video is low quality, you will never be able to make it better.\nI'm going to bet that it is because the iPad has a retina screen and when you full-screen the video it stretches the video's picture.\n", "Q: Is there anyway to show stopwatch on iOS Lockscreen?

Often, if the cloned volume will not boot, it is a hardware issue – the newer system often cannot be booted by an earlier OS (sometimes even with the same version #).

Second, when you say \"hidden mode\" you mean run in the background.\nWhat happens if you run the command from the command line?\nHow do you know the command isn't running when you run it in background mode? Are you doing a \"ps\" command from the command line to see if it is running or not?\nHave you tried adding \">>~/HB_log.txt 2>&1\" just before the \"&\" command so that you get a log of both the output and the errors it might be putting out?\nIf only the first part of the name is being used then I assume that the quote characters around the name are being stripped - try escaping them with a '\\'.

Now I don't have it anymore and I want to link it with another audio device and it seems to be unable to forget the Bose one and link with my current device, how could I erase the Bose device?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > BlueTooth and you will have a list of the devices remembered by the Mac. When BlueTooth is on you can select one and then at the right of the selection will be an 'X' icon. Click on it and the item will be removed from the list.\n\nFor reasons that escape understanding you can only do this when BlueTooth is on.\n\nA: In System Preferences > Bluetooth, make sure that Bluetooth is on and the Show Bluetooth in menu bar check box is checked. Then hold down alt or option before clicking the Bluetooth toolbar menu icon.  Now, in the device's contextual menu you can remove it.\n\n\nA: In extreme situations sometimes the options mentioned so far do not work.  If you are having troubles removing the device you can delete\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\n\nand reboot.  This will remove all bluetooth devices and you can then add the ones you want back by pairing them again.  I wouldn't recommend this option if you don't understand clearly how to delete the file and how to pair devices.  In other words, don't do it unless you know what you're doing.\nUsing the terminal:\nsudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist && sudo shutdown -r now\n\n", "Q: Local copy of Xcode (Lion) I have old macbooks with Lion. Because these are testing machines for different tasks, many reinstallations happens. Downloading the Xcode from the AppStore every time (2.5GB) is slow. Further complicating matters is the \"download size\" of Xcode 4.3.6 (the latest Xcode for Lion) is 2.5GB, but the application size in /Applications is 3.5GB - so happens some unpacking or so.. and want ensure than the simple copy of the Xcode.app is safe as I don't want a heavy solution that requires:\n\n\n*\n\n*time machine\n\n*SuperDuper or command line dd nor any other disk-copy utility\n\n*any other backup strategy - incremnetal or not...\n\n\nSimpy want to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*is enough copy the Xcode.app from the /Applications folder to another machine?\n\n*when I just installed the Xcode from the AppStore, is enough copy the Xcode.app to another notebook (same HW, same OS version).\n\n*if not - why - what is the difference in the RESULT (exactly) between copy and installing Xcode from the AppStore.\n\n\nHow can I safely reuse one download for multiple installs?\n\nA: I believe your best option is to use SuperDuper! to make a backup image of each machine with a clean instal of the OS and any software you know will be needed for testing every time. Once you have created the backup image it will make reinstalls much faster and easier.\nI have not tried copying the Xcode.app before, but I think you would be missing a lot of preferences and command line tools if all you copied was the app.\nEDIT:\nIf you download Xcode from the App Store and copy that Xcode.app package to another machine without ever launching it, it should work fine. There should be no preference files or app support until after the first time Xcode is launched. From my point of view though, this is not a very useful way of putting test/development machines together though because when I use Xcode I have it set-up a certain way with command line tools installed which would need to be done on each machine when you copy the Xcode.app.\n", "Q: How can I give a Space a custom name?

If I close the MBP the main desktop is switched to the external screen like I want. If the notebook goes in sleep mode and I wake it up with my wireless Apple keyboard than I cannot see a window. The problem is that the login screen after the wake up is on the MBP and not on the external screen. Launching mission control or similar doesn't work when you are logged of. What can I do that my main desktop stays on the external screen?\nThe only \"solution\" I came up with is that I open the MBP and close it again. Than I have the login screen on my external monitor. But that is not an ideal solution ... I'm using Lion (10.9.1).\n\nA: You can change your default display to the external monitor by setting a boot argument. Note that this will disable the internal display of your machine. It is described as the opposite of clamshell mode, but this isn't quite accurate, since this works when the clam is closed as well: \n\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"iog=0x0\" \n\nTo clear the boot argument, either reset the NVRAM or execute the following. The former will clear all NVRAM contents, the latter will only clear the boot arguments variable:\n\nsudo nvram -d boot-args\n\n", "Q: Mac Port install arguments \nI need to install ROOT on my mac. Since I prefer Python for Scientific Computing I though that it would install PyROOT by default. That didn't happen. After I looked on PyROOT site i found that installation is done by that line:\n./configure <arch> --enable-python [--with-python-incdir=<dir>] [--with-python-libdir=<dir>]\ngmake\n\nWhat would be alternative for that line above for enabling python on my macports installation? \n\nA: You need to reinstall root from macports and tell it what variants (i.e. additions it needs)\nport info root lists the variants e.g.\n\navahi, clang31, clang32, clang33, cocoa, debug, fftw3, fitsio, gcc43, gcc44, gcc45, gcc46, gcc47, [+]gcc48,\n                        gcc49, [+]graphviz, [+]gsl, ldap, mariadb, [+]minuit2, mysql, mysql51, mysql55, odbc, [+]opengl, percona,\n                        postgresql90, postgresql92, pythia, python26, python27, python31, python32, python33, python34, qt_mac,\n                        [+]roofit, ruby, [+]soversion, sqlite3, [+]ssl, [+]tmva, [+]xml, xrootd\n\nThe ones with [+] are installed by default.\nSo in your case choose the python version you want (e.g. python 3.3 as latest released one), also anything else you need as they are done all at the same time, so I might add qt_mac and sqlite3 as well\nsudo port install root +python33 +sqlite3 +qt_mac\n\nNote that python executable will be /opt/local/bin/python3.3 but you can use the select port to make it the one that /opt/local/bin/python uses\n", "Q: Flash higher CPU usage under OS X than Ubuntu? I recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 on a 2011 late Macbook pro. With the same version chrome and pepper flash plugin and flashblock extension to block irrevalent flash. When I watch some flash video online, I found that CPU usage is much higher under OS X Mavericks than on Ubuntu. And the MBP gets hot and fan runs very quickly under OS X, while in Ubuntu it is very cool as normal when watching same flash video online. I find it unintuitive because OS X should have better drivers than linux on MBP, making it more power-efficient and usually cooler. What could be the reason?\n\nA: Since you can't make any assumptions about how Flash for Mac or either Flash for Linux are implemented or how they utilize efficient APIs of their host OS you can't make any statements about why performance behaves so differently.\nAs long as graphics acceleration for video playback is available on both OS's it should be Flash's task to correctly use it.\nYou might want to check if Hardware Acceleration is enabled in Flash on Mac OS. To do this, right-click into a Flash-Applet and select \"Settings...\". Then, in the first tab (Display), you should be offered a Check-Button labeled \"Enable Hardware Acceleration\".\n\nPerformance is also dependent on the video codec of the media file. HD content from youtube for example only takes 10% CPU-time for me, whereas Flash content from other websites may also get my fans started.\n\nA: Four things come to mind immediately that would cause what you are seeing:\n\n\n*\n\n*The server is serving higher bitrate or a file that's encoded differently on OS X versus Linux.\n\n*The flash player code itself is better optimized on Linux than on OS X.\n\n*The code on Linux is calling better API than on OS X.\n\n*Other tasks are taking CPU or adding load on OS X and not on Linux.\n\n\nMy guess is a combination of several would be in play.\n", "Q: Is the MAC address of my VM different to the MAC address of the host? My landlord provides my connection to the internet and they are changing their network which requires me to register my iPhone and MBA. The instructions require me to use my MAC address at some point in the process. I run a VM using Parallels and all my mail goes to MS Outlook.\nDo I provide them with the MAC address from the VM (Windows 7) or from Mountain Lion? Might they be the same?\n\nA: The VM will use a virtual MAC address to map to the physical device MAC Address.  Keep in mind that if you provide the MAC Address of the Wi-Fi Adapter from your MBA, that you're now locked to using that device for connectivity.  Thus, your VM will need to use that device as it's bridged connection to the internet.\nYou should provide the physical hardware MAC address to allow your device and your VM access to the internet.\n\nA: I would have written this as a comment if my user status would allow me to. This is an addition to what james_fuller already explained:\nYou can connect to your VM to your host's NIC. It's like your host OS becomes a router for your VM. Thus your landlord's network won't see your VM at all but only your registered MacBook.\nRead about Shared Networking in this KB entry:\nParallels KnowledgeBase\nYou can enable Shared Networking in the preferences of your VM, a restart of the VM might be necessary.\nRegarding your other question:\n\nDo I provide them with the MAC address from the VM (windows 7) or from Mountain Lion? \n\nMAC addresses are supposed to be unique and having two identical ones in one network would cause some trouble, as ethernet packets aren't transported to an IP, but to a MAC address. A switch for example wouldn't know where to send it's packets and bot MACs would receive only parts of the data.\n", "Q: Sleep second display I have an iMac with a Thunderbolt display attached.\nI know I can force both displays to sleep by pressing ctrl-shift-eject.\nHow can I force only one display, the Thunderbolt one, to sleep?\nI do not use both displays all the time and sometimes I just don't want to waste the electricity.\n\nA: There is no direct control of this for an individual screen in Mac OS as you also can't go the other way round and turn off the laptop-display to only use the external one without closing the lid and keeping it closed.\nI guess you have to not plug in your external monitor if you don't want to use it.\n", "Q: How to show subject line for new messages in OS X Messages.app?

The MBP stopped working. I am now using that hard disk as external storage. After erasing the data (using Disk Utility), I see that almost 450MB is used by 57 files and was not expecting any allocation yet. \n\nIn Terminal, going to /Volumes/disk name/ and using du -h on each directory gave me a total of 1 MB consumption. \nMacintosh HD 1$ ls -la\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x  7 esarupa  2110378014   306B Jan 27 10:25 ./\ndrwxrwxrwt@ 4 root     admin        136B Jan 27 11:39 ../\ndrwx------  5 esarupa  2110378014   170B Jan 27 10:25 .Spotlight-V100/\nd-wx-wx-wt  2 esarupa  2110378014    68B Jan 27 10:25 .Trashes/\ndrwx------  5 esarupa  2110378014   170B Jan 27 10:34 .fseventsd/\n\nI am currently on 10.9.1, Processor: 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5. What are these files and why are they taking up 450MB? Is it possible that some files did not get erased and are not showing up in Terminal? \n\nA: My inclination is that your situation is both normal and expected.\nI have a 500 GB UDB HDD with almost the same Bytes capacity as yours and the folders you list are generated on all HFS+ filesystems to allow several items to work. Additionally, my SSD that I have connected over USB also was recently wiped and had 71 files, 312.8 MB of space used on a totally unused partition and after erasing it, the files and space used went to 39 and 312.5 MB respectively:\nMac:~ me$ cd /Volumes/SSD \nMac:SSD me$ sudo du -sm .Spotlight-V100/ .Trashes/ .fseventsd/\n1   .Spotlight-V100/\n0   .Trashes/\n1   .fseventsd/\n\nYou should expect your .Trashes folder to be empty and little actual space used for the other two folders. They hold filesystem metadata and databases used for Spotlight as well as Time Machine and other tools that track filesystem events. As you can see, I have 2 MB or so of allocation but 312.4 MB of space is not usable due to block allocation sizes, filesystem reserved space and other overhead.\n\nYou can use sudo ls -laR to get a complete listing of all the files on your disk. Also, the OS will recreate these files if you ever delete them, so your choice is to use HFS+ and let these exist / grow as needed or choose a filesystem that doesn't pre-allocate this space on that drive.\n\nA: There are two issues to consider here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Every disk has to maintain data files that contain information about every file (or potential file) on the disk, where each is physically located on the media, how many data blocks they occupy, permissions attributes, extended attributes, creation dates, modification dates, journaling information, etc. This catalog of information exists even on an empty formatted drive. Although the catalog may be \"empty\", the catalog data files still exist and take up space.\n\n*Even the tiniest regular file with a single character in it takes up more than one byte of space. This is because the disk will allocate at least one or more blocks for the file. On the computer I am currently on, a single character file is one byte in size, but occupies 4 kB on disk. I can edit this file and add content. If I stay below 4 kB in size, overall disk usage won't go up. If I exceed 4 kB in size, then additional blocks will have to be allocated and disk usage will grow to at least 8 kB.\n\n\nThe command du is only reporting \"user\" files inside your directory structure. It is not reporting usage by the disk catalog structures, so the usage does not need to match.\nTools exist that can perform low-level reads of a hard drive and extract information that was previously on the disk. That is a different topic entirely. But if that is your concern, you can perform a low-level erase, which will write random data multiple times to your hard drive to make data recovery difficult.\n\nA: I am wondering here, also, that we may just be seeing the difference in how the O/S calculates space and the drive manufacturers calculate space.\nI remember hearing (a while back) that the drive manufacturers often count space where (for example) 1KB = 1000 bytes and the O/S calculates space where 1KB = 1024 bytes. The latter being more \"correct\" from the O/S' perspective.\nWhen Hard drives were in the 5 to 500 MB range the differences in calculated size were small enough to blame it on bad blocks, o/s overhead, formatting, etc. But when you are dealing with vastly bigger disk sizes (millions/billions of times in many cases) the small byte difference gets to be very big and you end up with gigs and gigs of seemingly \"missing space.\"\nIt has been a while since I remember hearing about this and don't know if it is still common practice but I would guess that the overhead from the formatting, boot records and hidden partitions are usually tiny in comparison to disk sizes these days.\n\nA: You'll also want to use diskutil list to check if there is a hidden Boot Recovery partition.\nex.\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *512.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS 512                     511.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\nAs above, you can see that on this old Mac Book Pro of mine 650 MB are hidden for recovery tooling.\nThis is now called \"macOS Recovery\" and is a \"built-in recovery system on your Mac\". \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201314\nIf you are interested in removing this partition, see Can I remove Recovery HD partition?\n", "Q: What is more predominant, PyObjC or PlistBuddy?

Or I can use PlistBuddy to do the same thing. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice to which would be a safer assumption?\n\nA: Since /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy ships with OS X and doesn't need any developer tools or third party installation, you should assume that tool is ubiquitous and develop against that if at all possible.\nI actually prefer plutil to convert things to XML or JSON and then use a script to make whatever changes are necessary, but your options are not bad ones to use either.\n", "Q: OSX file navigation for pictures like windows In windows I can hold control and use my arrow keys.

So the ability to scroll through the list and see previews is important while group selecting. I'm trying to delete pictures. I have thousands in one folder. Should I use win32 to do this? or am I just missing how to do it with OSX?\n\nA: I often select images to keep or delete by generating HTML files like this:\nprintf %s\\\\n ~/Pictures/folder/*.jpg|while read l;do printf %s \"<a href=$l><img src=$l height=469></a>\";done>/tmp/a.html;open /tmp/a.html\nThen I for example move the files I opened in tabs to another folder:\nosascript -e 'set text item delimiters to linefeed' -e 'tell app \"Safari\" to URL of tabs of window 1 as text'|cut -d/ -f3-|xargs gmv -t ~/Desktop\n\nA: Well, unless there is specific reason why you want to delete all the selected pictures at once, you could just flip through them in the finder (using Cover Flow view in the finder) and Command + Delete the images you want to delete as you come across them.\nThis will effectively move each chosen image to the Trash.\n", "Q: Is there a way to shutdown mac when screen is turned off?

Note that adjustments to Energy Saver settings may reset the hibernate mode, so you'll want to set up any other options first.\nYou can then use the pmset command (from the Terminal) to adjust the hibernate mode.\nThere are three recommended hibernate modes (none are supported except the default).\n\n\n*\n\n*0 = basic sleep, memory stays in RAM only\n\n*3 = portable sleep, memory backed up to hibernate file, RAM is kept powered for a fast resume, but if power runs out the hibernate file can be used to resume\n\n*25 = hibernate only, memory backed up to hibernate file and RAM powered down\n\n\nYou can adjust the hibernate mode as follows (this sets it to the 3rd option):\n# sudo pmset hibernatemode 25\n\nAnd you can check its status via:\n# pmset -g\n\nWhich will list all the power management settings (look for hibernatemode in the list to see how it's set). You'll want to check that after you adjust any Energy Saver settings, or install OS X updates.\n\nA: May be I got it totally wrong, but you are watching a video and then you shutdown your TV? And then you expect that the computer gets notification and stops the video playback?\nWhy do you not stop the video before the shutdown of the TV?\nOr - if you want to shutdown your MacMini and TV: there a several media centers which offer a (remote controlled) shutdown of the computer.

The mac : iMac Mid-2007\nHow do i clean the dust from inside or clean inside of it. Basically im saying how do I open the mac? \n\nA: There's an access door on the bottom of the Mac which can be unscrewed.\n\nFor further access, you need to take the glass off, which is fixed with fourteen magnets.\n\nSource: http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iMac+Intel+20-Inch+EMC+2133+and+2210+Hard+Drive+Replacement/1008\n\nA: The internals of your iMac are accessed through the looking glass.\nYou'll want to get some suction cups and special tools if you care to. There are somewhat nice take apart guides at ifixit.com and also pause before you go in to realize that parts can be very expensive and if you rip the display cable off the logic board, you can do multiple hundreds of dollars of damage in an instant should the LCD panel slip if the iMac pivots when you don't expect it.\n", "Q: iOS 7 Messages app reverts from iMessage to SMS at random I am having an issue with the Messages app on iOS 7.0.4 (11B554a) whereby on conversations that were previously all SMS and the other person purchases an iPhone, Messages reverts from sending iMessages to SMS seemingly at random. \nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling/re-enabling iMessages in the Settings app (temporary fix)\n\n*Killing Messages from the multitasking view (temporary fix)\n\n*Disabling the \"Send as SMS\" option in Messages settings (does not work)\n\n\nHas anyone else experienced this or know of a possible solution? I am considering using a third party tool like iExplorer to export all of my conversations and starting fresh, but I really view it as a last resort since some of these conversations have been with me since the launch of the original iPhone in 2007.\nEdit 1: I should point out that these are not failures to send an iMessage that results in a fallback to SMS, rather I notice as I'm composing the message that the text entry box has the subtle \"Text Message\" on it and the Send button is green. I perform steps #1 or #2 (typically #2) and the iMessage is sent and received just fine.\nEdit 2: Further investigation has shown that when the Messages app isn't used for a long period or is suspended due to a using resource intensive app (like a 3D game), this behavior will occur -- the Messages app will show messages to the one person who I used to contact with SMS has reverted to SMS again while everyone else still shows as being iMessage capable so I don't believe my connection Apple's servers is the issue. Again, simply killing the Messages app from the multitasking view shows everyone is capable of iMessage again and iMessages are sent and received properly.\n\nA: iMessage is essentially an Apple operated Instant Messenger service deployed to compete with, or augment, SMS and MMS.\niOS will use iMessage to deliver a message if there is a data connection available to Apple's servers and both the sender and recipient are known by Apple to have iMessage configured for their respective addresses.\nMost likely if a person you regularly iMessage with is now sometimes receiving as SMS it is due to intermittent data connection (ie you are mobile and data service is failing). Otherwise it could be an Apple iMessage server issue - seems to crop up regularly.\nFurthermore in the last three weeks several of my friends and family have reported issues with iMessage so possibly there is something deeper and worse going on with iMessage servers.\ncheers\n", "Q: Behavior of login shell vs. Linux, 'sh -c' I have a seemingly-valid command that works fine on Linux boxes but fails on OSX, and I would like to know why.\nsudo su - validusername sh -c 'whoami'\n\nOn Linux, this will echo 'validusername' on the console.  OSX however, shows an error:\n/bin/sh: /bin/sh: cannot execute binary file\n\nIs this an OSX particularity?  Or is it due to the fact that OSX uses bash 3.2, while our linux boxes are on bash 4.x?\nEDIT: I figured out a workaround quickly (sudo -u), I am mainly interested in learning why this happened.  Thanks!\n\nA: try\nsudo -su validusername sh -c 'whoami'\n\n\nA: or:\nsudo su - username -c whoami\n\nThe su man page says\n\n su [-] [-c class] [-flms] [login [args]]\n\n...\nIf the optional args are provided on the command line, they are passed to\n       the login shell of the target login.  Note that all command line argu-\n       ments before the target login name are processed by su itself, everything\n       after the target login name gets passed to the login shell.\n\n\nA: OK, to start with you don't need both 'su' and 'sudo' - just the 'su' will do. I also doubt under Linux that you have the 'sh' since the effect of the '-' is to run a login shell but what on earth the poor shell is attempting in your command with both is anybody's guess.\nI live in a world where we remove sudo from our Linux boxes so I can't check if your command actually works.\nUnder both OS X and Linux the command su - username -c 'whoami' will echo username.\nThere are some differences between the 'su' and 'sudo' found on Linux and OS X but they are due to the differences between our laid back, West Coast, BSD version of Unix and the uptight, East Coast, AT&T derived Gnu utilities used in the average Linux distro rather than bash versions since neither is a bash builtin.\n", "Q: Apple iPhone 4 does not recognize my DC car charger Apple iPhone 4 does not recognize my DC car charger AC charger works fine. I bought a new DC charger and it still does not recognize that charger. I took it back and exchange it for another one and it does not recognize it as ever being plugged in. I did not buy a cheap charger—that was a $30 charger.\n\nA: The most likely explanation is that this is a generic charger not designed/tested for use with an iPhone. Have a look here for a more detailed explanation, but in a nutshell, iPhone-compatible chargers need to put out some very specific voltage levels on the USB data (NOT power) lines to be recognized by the iPhone.\nSo, unless this charger specifically states that it is iPhone-compatible, it just won't work without internal modifications, and you should just return it and get one that is made for iPhone. \n\nA: this is all related to the new upgrade of IOS7, the charger and cable are still good but Apple is trying to stick us into their products... you can still charge your device by rebooting it while charging :) \n", "Q: Is it safe to delete ~/Library/Caches? Is it safe to delete the file Caches, in the Library of the Mac OS X Hard Drive?\nIt's a pretty big file, 3.56 GB, Caches reminds me of logs i don't need or browser cookies. \nIs it safe to delete the folder \"Caches\"?\n\nA: It's generally safe, though a little dangerous depending, to do it but often not worth the effort.\nThe caches in /System/Library/Caches are generally small and useful, the ones in /Library/Caches are less system caches and much more readily cleared.\nIf you have a look in ~/Library/Caches you will find a bunch of applications have a cache in there, none of them particularly large though dropbox sometimes has a fair sized cache. This folder can run quite large just because so many apps cache something in there.\nIf the cache /Library/Caches folder is over 3Gb then you have something that is caching quite a lot. On the three machines I just checked none had a /Library/Caches folder over .75 Gb so I'd go right ahead and remove some of it.\nDon't worry about age, I'd worry about size.\nIn the terminal run the following to sort all of the files in that directory by size (ascending):\ndu -sh /Library/Caches/* | sort -h\n\nOf course the best way to clear the caches is to install AppleJack and do it with that in single user mode. Doing it with the System fully up can be a little dangerous. If you do it then I'd reboot immediately afterwards.\n\nA: Yes it is safe to delete the contents of that folder.\nI usually reboot right after just to be sure but that is temporary file storage and the contents (not the folder itself) can be deleted safely\n\nA: Have no fear, delete caches but I prefer to do it either via Single-User mode or I use https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html Check Onyx out as it does some good maintenance scripts as well.\n\nA: Yes. However you may want to look inside the folder and selectively delete old caches rather then just dumping the whole folder.\n\nA: I would not blindly delete all.\nIf you want to do a safe clean up, use the browser tools for history and cookie clean up.\nMy cache folder is 3.7 gig, and it does contains some important files, so I would not mess with it.\nFor Safari use the Reset Safari function and select your choices.\n\nFYI, in my case the app Garmin (European GPS maps) was using >2gig in cache.\nOnce I was done with it, I deleted it and now back to .7 gig.\nIn summary, cleaning cache is usually best done by using the respective browser's tools, to delete all the junk accumulated from the web. If you delete something important by mistake that way, well go on the web and get it again.\n\nA: Yes, it is safe. That said, don't just delete all the contents of your cache folder without reason. \nIt can be beneficial to clear out those taking up the significant space in your ~/Library/Caches/ if you need to free some up, but you really shouldn't clear any contents of your /System/Caches unless there is a problem. As would be expected, you will find that the programs you access most often have the largest cache size. \nThere's a misconception that purging your caches regularly constitutes \"maintenance,\" optimization, etc of your machine, but that's a fallacy; Always remember that caches improve the performance of your machine, and shouldn't be cleaned out regularly or blindly without a specific reason.  \nReally, the only two reasons to clear out a cache are 1) space considerations (it’s simply growing too large) or 2) You're troubleshooting a problem. \n", "Q: Why doesn't my messages icon on my iPhone 5 display the number of messages? I don't know if I may have accidentally changed some settings, but now the icon on my Messages doesn't display the number of unread messages. However, my Mail app does, so I am not sure why this is. I tried going through settings to see what I could find, but to no avail.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: You've turned it off in Notification Center.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings, then scroll to Notification Center and tap it.\n\n*Scroll down to the \"Include\" section; \"Messages\" should be there. If not you've turned off notifications for it altogether; scroll on down to \"Do Not Include\" and you should see it there. In either case, tap it.\n\n*Tap the \"Badge App Icon\" switch so it's on.\n\n\nYour messages count should be back.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to view next page in Microsoft Word for Mac? Is there a keyboard shortcut to view the next page in Microsoft Word for Mac?\nIn Adobe Reader, when I press the Right Arrow key, the view jumps to the next page.\nI am looking for something similar in Microsoft Word for Mac.\n\nA: In Word 2011 (the only version I have to test) Command-page up and Command-page down go to the top of the previous and next page respectively.\nUnfortunately I don't have a Mac laptop with Office loaded to test but on my Apple keyboard fn-command-up arrow and fn-command-down arrow also work.\n\nA: On an extended keyboard, you can use \"page up\" and \"page down\" keys. Since you are asking the question, I assume you are on a laptop or have a standard keyboard.\nIn that case, you can use the function (fn) key along with the up and down arrows. It's not exactly the same since it also moves the cursor, but it will advance the view to the next or previous page.\n", "Q: Why are my iPhone notes being emailed to me? I just realized that some of the notes in my iPhone (i.e. in the standard \"Notes\" app) are emailed to me soon after I write them.\nThere is no \"to\" address in the email so I can't tell what address they're being sent to (I use different email addresses for everything).\nI may decide that this is a useful feature but to be honest I'm a little creeped out by it.  How does it know what email address to send it to?  I'm assuming it's the one associated with my Apple id but like I said I don't know.\nHow can I stop it (if I decide I want to), and what options are there for controlling this (and where are they?).  \nI don't see any settings for this anywhere, in Settings or in the Notes app itself.\n\nA: iOS uses mail to store notes similar to other office type software. \nYou can disable that by going to settings and turning off notes for any mail account where you are being creeped out. \n\nA: Go to Settings → Notes and change the default account to \"On My iPhone\". Your problem will be sorted out!\n", "Q: PDF magazine to Newsstand solution on low budget? I'm a student in charge of my university's magazine, and I'm interested in finding a user and budget friendly solution to distributing a tablet version on Apple's Newsstand. \nI'm not the best programmer in the world, but I can follow a tutorial - is there a simple framework that I'd be able to train people how to use? I've noticed some apps are basically glorified PDF viewers with no frills. That would be good enough for us - we're not looking to do anything special, we're just looking to do something.\nI have an iOS developer account, and we might be able to invest in some software - but paying an outside company a subscription to do it for us would be a little harder to justify, especially if it's too expensive, because all of our budget decisions go through a bureaucratic meat grinder.\nFor reference - we do pretty much everything on InDesign. Unfortunately, we can't fit Creative Cloud Professional memberships in the budget (not even one).\nTo boil it down: are there any solutions out there that are friendly to english and journalism majors? Or are there any companies who offer educational discounts to organisations like ours who might be able to help?  \n\nA: Newsstand requires building an actual iOS application, albeit a simple one. I'm not sure an English major could manage that (he says, who was once a professional computer programmer and English major).\nYou might be better to consider iBooks. Check out https://developer.apple.com/ibooks/\nYou can download iBooks Author for free in the Mac App store to build extremely nice iBooks and they can then be put into the bookstore if you have a developer account. You might then email all your subscribers with a link to grab the new issue. iBooks Author is almost as much fun to use a InDesign and certainly more fun than Pages.\nIf you are convinced to go the Newsstand route then I suggest you find an iOS programmer who can assist you. You will need a good understanding of the iOS WebKit framework (as the most likey way to handle your content), the Newsstand framework and the push framework at an absolute minimum. Once you have the app coded and running then the difficulty of creating an issue depends on exactly how you decide to handle it in your app. The app gets passed the issue as a bundle and how it deals with it is entirely up to your app.\n\nA: Have you considered using Baker? It's an opensource Newsstand app framework, and has a lot of features. We've created a number of magazine apps on the App Store, from paid solutions (for Vogue, using Magplus) to free using Baker. \nBaker takes a bit more time than Magplus, but it is free. It uses HTML, so it may not fit your workflow. However, you can get a plugin, In5, which saves the output of InDesign to the Baker format. The plugin is paid, but i believe they have education discounts.\n", "Q: Do root actions as non root in Mavericks?

Do Not Disturb has also been turned off. \nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: I assume that you have checked that the hardware switch on the side of the phone isn't set to silent?\nRight near the volume buttons is a switch, if it shows red then your phone is on silent, flick it up and the phone is no longer on silent.\n\nA: I fixed the won't ring problem by inserting & removing my headphones jack.

I purchased the book from the iBooks store. At a couple points in the past the specific book in question was deleted off my iPad for some reason. However I was able to both times go to my purchases and re-download it on the iPad and iPhone and my reading position was even preserved.\nHowever on my Mac, it appears to be in an inconsistent state. The book shows up as not being downloaded at all. \n\nso then I try and download it and it appears to download 99.99% of the book, but then quickly shows this dialog\n\nWhen I look in the downloads folder for iBooks it appears to be mostly (if not all) there, but I keep consistently getting that dialog every time I try and re-download the book.\n\nSince this is from the iBooks store and iBooks thinks its not downloaded, it appears to disable deleting the book (for some reason.) So I can't just delete it and then re-download it. Has anybody encountered anything like this and have any suggestions for how to finally get iBooks to re-download this book in its entirety? I think I should probably also file a radar with Apple asking for the ability to delete books in this state (if it isn't a bug.) Thanks.\n\nA: I have never had only problems with iBooks. But when downloading 'Get Sample' of your book \"designing bsd root kits\" the same error occurred!\nIt is likely that this book is corrupted in the Store. Give Apple a call and see what they can do. This might not be your fault at all.\n\n\nA: I managed to replicate your problem but just a quit of iBooks, wait a few minutes and then run the app again cleared it.\nI also found that clicking on the download arrow at the right of the toolbar shows a list of the books awaiting download. Clicking on the orange try again icon made the hung file disappear from this list.\nHave you tried deleting it from the iBooks download folder and then re-trying?\n\nA: Well I thought i'd post a follow up and the eventual solution to this weird problem. So I did end up contacting apple, and they did try to help me solve this issue, however nothing really helped on OS X. I was about to try and see if I could extract the file of the book off my iphone, but before I could do that OS X 10.10 Yosemite came out.

I picked up an external hard drive a while back and have been using it for Time Machine back-ups.

The only thing \"weird\" that I can imagine that might be causing this is that I'm not using the whole disk for back-up; it's about four times larger than my internal SSD, so I just partitioned half to use as the Time Machine partition and intend to use the other part for general storage (once I have something I need to store on it). Does Time Machine need the whole disk to do encryption? I tried selecting the empty partition to see if it would make an encrypted back-up on there, but still, no dice.\nIf I have to repartition the entire disk to be able to do encrypted back-ups, I will, but I'd like to ensure that that will do any good before I do so.\nIf partitioning isn't the problem, any suggestions for figuring out what the real one is?\n\nA: According to this page: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11102\n\nIf the Encrypt checkbox is available, you can select it to keep your\n  backup disk secure. If the Encrypt checkbox is dimmed, your backup\n  disk doesn’t support encryption.\nEncryption is available only for Time Capsules and for partitions or\n  disks attached directly to your computer and partitioned with the GPT\n  partition scheme. If encryption is not available for your disk, put\n  the mouse pointer on the dimmed checkbox, and after a moment an\n  explanation appears. If a disk needs to be reformatted or\n  repartitioned to support encryption, Time Machine prompts you to do\n  so.\n\nSo check and see what the mouse has to say about why it is dimmed out the encryption option. It could well be that you need to reformat the drive\n", "Q: How can I stop AirPort from waking my Macbook Pro? Recently I have noticed my MacBook Pro is completely discharging when I leave it to sleep. After investigation I've discovered traces similar to the following in the Console output:\n24/01/2014 18:35:11.000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake\n24/01/2014 18:35:57.000 kernel[0]: Wake reason: XHC1\n24/01/2014 18:36:01.000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake\n24/01/2014 18:37:01.000 kernel[0]: Wake reason: XHC1\n24/01/2014 18:37:05.000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake\n24/01/2014 18:37:50.000 kernel[0]: Wake reason: XHC1\n24/01/2014 18:37:55.000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake\n24/01/2014 18:38:56.000 kernel[0]: Wake reason: XHC1\n24/01/2014 18:38:59.000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake\n\nAnd so on and so forth until it eventually kills the battery and it gives up altogether. Obviously this is, er, unhelpful and I'd like it to stop. I've unticked 'wake for network access' in the energy saver settings but it makes no difference. I've disabled 'allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer' and switch Bluetooth off. I've also unplugged all peripherals before sleep to check it wasn't something else triggering it. I have, of course, tried restarting.\nThis is a mid 2012 MacBook Pro, currently running OS X 10.9.1 but it was happening with 10.8.4 as well.\nCan anyone suggest how I can stop this happening?\nEdit: More information, as requested in the comments\npmset -g log | grep wake gives pages of this\n24/01/2014 18:33:55 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                   \n24/01/2014 18:35:01 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                   \n24/01/2014 18:35:50 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                   \n24/01/2014 18:36:55 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                   \n24/01/2014 18:37:44 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                   \n24/01/2014 18:38:49 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                   \n24/01/2014 18:39:15 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                   \n24/01/2014 18:40:20 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                   \n24/01/2014 18:41:24 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None\n\ninterspersed with occasional sections like this:\n24/01/2014 17:40:47 GMT  Assertions             PID 18(powerd) Created InternalPreventSleep \"com.apple.powermanagement.darkwakelinger\" 00:00:00  id:0xe000008ff [System: SRPrevSleep kCPU]            \n24/01/2014 17:41:02 GMT  Assertions             PID 18(powerd) TimedOut InternalPreventSleep \"com.apple.powermanagement.darkwakelinger\" 00:00:15  id:0xe000008ff [System: SRPrevSleep kCPU]           \n24/01/2014 17:41:02 GMT  Assertions             PID 18(powerd) Released InternalPreventSleep \"com.apple.powermanagement.darkwakelinger\" 00:00:15  id:0xe000008ff [System: SRPrevSleep kCPU]           \n24/01/2014 17:41:07 GMT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None\n\n\nA: You have gotten pretty far and tried several things. Found this gem: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11080 which has a list of things, some of which you have already done. \nXHC1 refers to a Bluetooth device that is trying to wake your system but the fact that you are getting a output of \"AirPort_Brcm43xx\", the AirPort message pointed me to: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4645214?tstart=0\nAnd if you have everything unplugged, BT is off and you have disabled the \"Wake for network access\" then I have a tendency to think that your OS is corrupted. I would go so far as to say that Power Nap is the service is that causing this but hard to say without for logs and I don't have that much free time! ;)\nUnfortunately in the Apple discussion there was no marked answer/solution so if the issue still remains after a reinstall or test OS then you might have a hardware issue. You could also try resetting the SMC (http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964) maybe the AirPort/Bluetooth card and MLB need a quick power cycle via the reset.\nHope that helps in some way.\n\nA: I eventually figured this out, and the Airport thing was actually a red herring: that message simply pings up as it comes out of sleep.\nIt seems there was a two fold failure. The first was fixed by resetting the SMC but the problem continued, albeit less persistently. However, whatever issue the SMC was causing was hiding the second issue: something about the keyboard I have plugged in is triggering it to wake from sleep. Because the SMC was causing it to wake regardless I didn't pick this up when I was first checking for peripherals waking it.\nSo there you go. Thanks to everyone who helped.\nI haven't figured out a way to solve the problem properly yet, I just have to remember to unplug the keyboard.\n\nA: Open AirPort Utility → Preferences and uncheck Monitor AirPort base stations for problems.\n", "Q: How to setup Gmail SMTP server for OSX Mail with 2-step-verification and App-specific password? Haven't been able to solve this problem with the threads such as here.\nMy Gmail stops always working after a while, perhaps after accessing it in different WIFI network or something like this -- it is really driving crazy thing. The Gmail account uses 2-step-verification and app-specific password. I cannot understand this SMTP thing.\nHow to configure Gmail with App-specific password and 2-step-verification to OSX Mail?\nHelper question\n\n\n*\n\n*how to add the app-specific password to keychain?\n\n\n*app-specific password used in the Internect Access list?\n\nDescription and issues\n\n\n\n\n\nA: The SMTP server is used to send mail.\n(Note: There are two locations you must paste you app-specific password, these instructions are for the 'sending' server, not the 'receiving' server')\nGo to Google and generate an app-specific password on this page.\nNow open Mail and go to Preferences > Accounts and select your Google account. At the bottom of the right hand pane it will say \"Outgoing Server (SMTP):\" and should have \"Gmail\" selected/ Click on this and you get a pop up menu and select \"Edit SMTP Server List\".\n(This accounts area is where you paste in your 'recieving' password under 'incoming mail server'. Incoming server should be: imap.gmail.com, your username should be the start of your email address without the '@gmail.com' section and your password should be the app-specific password, NOT the account password that was previoulsy used)\nThis will open a list of the SMTP servers you have set up for sending mail. Click on the \"Gmail\" one and then click on \"Advanced\".\nSet Authentication to \"Password\" enter your Google user name then the app-specific password you generated in the password field.\nThis should now work until you revoke the password.\n\nA: The old settings in Keychain can mess up the settings, actually observed earlier by jmegawarne. After I removed the old settings from Keychain, things started to work so clean up the old passwords from Keychain! And remember to input the app-specific password at least two times, not the Gmail password.\nProcedure\n\n\n*\n\n*remove all passwords and usernames from Keychain that are related to the email you are trying to set up\n\n\n*follow the guide by Tony but notice that you need to give the \"Application specific password\" at least two times so screenshot it or copy it to paper. It is enough to create only one password (misunderstanding in earlier threads).\n\n\nA: Don't set the 2 factor app-specific password you generate in Google on the Preferences → Account screen first. Go to the outgoing mail server settings first, set it there and come back to the main account setting and rekey that password.\nSurprisingly, this stupid gymnastics with the setting worked for me!\n\nA: The only way I have been able to get around this is to use a different SMTP server.\nI use the paid SMTP server from my internet provider.\n\nA: I was having the same problem today and found out this question. \nAccording to Google: \n\nIf you have iOS 8.3 on your iPhone or OSX 10.10.3 on your Mac, you\n  will no longer have to use App passwords to use 2-Step Verification.\n\nYou may have to add the account again for it to ask you for the verification code.\n", "Q: Difference between auto-downloading \"all\" podcasts vs. \"most recent\" On my iPhone 5 with ios 7 I can choose to automatically download \"all\" episodes or \"most recent\". At first glance it sounds obvious what the difference is, but since I've had the \"all\" setting checked for a while on a podcast that has not started auto downloading (I have enough free space) I have to ask. The app has had plenty of wifi access. The podcast has some added but not downloaded episodes. \nAuto downloading the most recent episode only makes sense if it keeps downloading the most recent episode at all points in time from then on. So basically that's the same as \"most recent and all future episodes\". The \"all\" setting should then download everything, but what is confusing in that case is that as an explanation of the auto-download settings it says \"automatically download new episodes\". So is the \"all\" option \"all future episodes\" or what? If so there's almost no difference between the two settings. \n\nA: From my experience, the Podcast.ipa will stop downloading podcasts if you haven't listened to several recent ones. It will update the list to say that they are there but it will not download them unless, I think, the most recent 3-5 episodes have been placed.\n\"Most Recent\" in the context of Podcast.ipa means it will keep the 3 most recent episodes on your iOS device. It will still sync/save where you last listed to previous episodes but it removes it to conserve space. If you have all selected it will download the most current one and update in the future while retaining all episodes that it/you has/have downloaded until you \"physically\" delete it from the list/device.\nBut I too have noticed an issue with the last couple versions of the Podcast.ipa where it doesn't download even though I am subscribed and it is set to download \"All\" I think this is bug at this point in time and hope that they fix it soon.

Later, I see my swap file jumps up, but my inactive memory still has about 7gb left. Why is the os not utilizing the inactive memory but insteads swap out to disk???\n\nA: The general answer is that Java's pattern of memory usage differs from other apps as it uses garbage collection in a fixed size memory thus getting all the memory it might use up front rather than getting it when it is needed..\nThe start is the JVM allocating the memory, then I think its garbage collection tends to access the memory often or else you have allocated the large Java dataset and only accessing part of it. Thus the 11G of memory is accessed but not often enough to be marked as active. A C based program won't have a background thread looking at all the pages of memory so pages can be inactive long enough to be swapped out.\nFrom experience albeit on other OSs Java really slows down if any of its memory is swapped and you adjust the size of its VM so it does not. If you need more memory then get more RAM or alter the algorithm to use less.\n", "Q: how to remove ffmpeg ? and install again I want to remove ffmpeg.

Single user mode is triggered by holding cmd-s at startup:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1492\nThe single-user mode environment is quite a bit different than the standard terminal, because you login as root and a lot of system services are turned off, so it is not equivalent to the >console approach.\n\nA: I'm having the same issue and can add the following:\nsshed into the machine prior to entering >console at the login window.\nEntered >console and hit return at the login window.\nOn the machine that was connected via ssh I ran sudo tail /var/log/system.log which showed evidence of a SecurityAgent crash.\nkilled (kill -HUP ) the WindowServer process (via ssh) and immediately got a white block in the top left corner of the screen.

marked as version 2.1.\nBy changing the second line to\nVERSION:3.0\n\nI was able to import the vCards. This is a bit of a pain, but if you can export all of your contacts from Outlook in a singe vCard file then it should be ok (I am not sure if Outlook supports this). Alternatively you could use a text editor with 'find and replace in files' feature such as Sublime Text 2 to replace VERSION:2.1 with VERSION:3.0 in all your files.\nFinally, the version 2.1 files import fine into Contacts.app on OS X so this may work if you are using a mac.\n\nA: None of the above worked for me - the vCards were already at Version 3.0 but I still got that error, despite being well within the iCloud limits. Luckily enough, I was a Mac user so I was able to workaround this by import into into the Contacts up on the MacBook, which seems to be less fussy about vCard format. You can set up the Contacts app to sync to the iCloud.\n", "Q: Splicing a lightning cable? I need to connect a female end of a lightning to the male end of a mini USB. I have found one online, but its out of stock. How would I go about splicing these together? Would it work? Just match the wires together?\n\nA: Unlikely as lightning cables have circuitry in them.\nIf you are just replacing the USB end of the cable it MIGHT work, but it would depend on what kind of circuitry is in the cable and where it is located.\nIf there is anything beyond a bog-standard USB on one end then probably not, if one end IS just USB then this might work.\nIf you do it post back to this question with your results.\n", "Q: Make Dropbox app upload in background without having to open every 10 minutes Is there any kind of workaround to get Dropbox on iPhone iOS to work as well as it does on Android?\nInstalling Dropbox on the iPhone requires manually triggering the upload process instead of it running itself in the background. Dropbox only runs for about 10 minutes every time you open the app or change location. If you rarely change location then it might as well be manual upload only. In my situation I rarely change location for days and even a week or two at a time. I might take as many as thirty photos, but they will only start uploading when I open the app, and they will only continue uploading for 10 minutes. \nIn addition to that, it seems to hang for no reason at every tenth photo or so (which might be a different issue, but please address it if you have ideas). The final result is a lot more annoyance than it's worth. \nOn Android, I installed Dropbox, set it up, then I never opened it again for nearly a year and it worked flawlessly.\nHow can I get the iOS version of Dropbox to work like it does on Android?\n\nA: Jailbreak your phone and then download 'Background Manager' and it'll bypass Apple always killing DropBox in the background every 10 minutes.  It's great because now DropBox will upload in the background or at night when I'm sleeping, while the iphone is plugged in!\n\nA: Obviously, Android and iOS are two very different operating systems, with different ways of doing things.  Apple chooses not to let apps run in the background forever.  This helps reduce the drain on the device's battery.  That being said, \"Background App Refresh\" has been around for a while.  App devs have to add this capability to their apps.  It isn't done automatically.  \n\nA: You can't. There are restrictions with iOS multitasking that prevent apps like this from running all the time. You might be able to bypass this by jailbreaking though.\nAlso, apps can't bypass this on the App Store due to guidelines such as:\n\n2.5 Apps that use non-public APIs will be rejected\n\nSource: https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html\n\nA: The \"Background uploading\", even though it has been here for a while, as the OP said, is only temporary; that is, one must open the app once in a while, and the app is still closed after that 10 min period. The only real background upload happens when the phone detects a location change. Anyway, now at least I know why I have to manually open the app to upload the photos.\n\nA: My photos suddenly began refusing to upload in the middle of a hike. They stubbornly stayed stuck even after letting Dropbox have focus overnight, as @UweKeim suggested. I kept this screen lit for more than 12 hours, to no avail:\n\nWhat got the logjam moving for me was manually moving a few files from Photos to the Dropbox Camera Uploads folder.\n\n*\n\n*in the iPhone Photos app, Library tab, select one photo (one at a time, smh)\n\n*upload icon\n\n*\"Save to Dropbox\" action (not the Dropbox logo)\n\n*Choose a Different Folder... (Camera Uploads in my case)\n\n*Save\n\n*delete the photo from the Photos app\n\nI can't be sure which file Dropbox was choked on. There was one 25MB panorama, a couple 18MB videos. (I've uploaded much larger photos without incident.) After I moved about a half dozen of the oldest files that were due to be uploaded next, and deleted them from the Photos app, then gave Dropbox focus, the rest uploaded automatically.\nFeeling the need for some iCloud antitrust busting. Just sayin'.\n\nA: Dropbox for iPhone has a new feature called \"Background uploading\" and it does just that. Check the settings icon and enable it.\n\nA: There is a new feature in the settings named ‘Camera Upload’. This is basically an automatic sync of your created photos to dropbox.\nIf you enable this you'll also have an extra option popup: ‘Background Uploading’, however as far as I can tell, this works only for the uploads done by the ‘Camera Upload’ feature.\nDropbox doc links:\nWhat is background uploading?\nHow do I enable or disable Camera Upload? \n", "Q: Mac Lync Conversation History Storage Location Anyone know where Mac Lync 2011 stores its conversation history?

Recently, I tried to make 50 GB partition using Disk Utility but the whole process didn't complete, and I had to restart the system as it hanged (Even Force Quit wasn't working). Upon reboot, I saw that I was missing 50GB space. When I tried to verify the disk, it showed me the following error:\n\"Partition map check failed because no slices were found.\"\nCan I fix it without using external drive? Please help.\n\nA: *\n\n*Reboot into Single User Mode (hold cmd-S on boot)\n\n\n*Run /sbin/fsck -fy\nfsck is File System Consistency checK. -f forces the process, and -y assumes yes.\nThis will basically run Disk Utility's Repair Disk, but outside of the OS so that is has full read/write to the disk.\n\n\n*Once complete, reboot\n\nA: Run the fstab command and remove all the setting there, then write the command. What I had there was preventing my Windows BootCamp partition from mounting. After removing it everything worked fine.\nhttp://www.cnet.com/how-to/prevent-a-partition-from-mounting-in-os-x/\n\nA: I recieved \"Partition map check failed because no slices were found.” from Disk Utility but perhaps for different reasons.\nI had to reMOUNT (either it's a \"right-click\" or a button) the partition from Disk Utility and then Repair the partition.\nThen it worked - heart attack / data loss averted.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and the following the method of the link below helped me.\nhttps://perrohunter.com/repair-a-mac-os-x-hfs-partition-table/#comment-127930\n", "Q: Are there any apps that copy files to another location whenever they change? I've been trying to change my IDE from NetBeans to Sublime Text.\nThe most important thing that keeps me using NetBeans is the \"Copy files from Sources Folder to another location\" feature.\nI can't find a plug-in for Sublime Text that can perform this task.\n\nA: Your problem can be solved using 'Folder Actions'. You can create folder actions using AppleScript or Automator. If you do not know what 'Folder Actions are, you can read the Folder Actions Reference page on the Apple site to get you started.\n\nFolder Actions Reference\nFolder Actions is a feature of OS X that lets you associate\n  AppleScript scripts with folders. A Folder Action script is executed\n  when the folder to which it is attached is opened or closed, moved or\n  resized, or has items added or removed. The script provides a handler\n  that matches the appropriate format for the action, as described in\n  this chapter.\nFolder Actions make it easy to create hot folders that respond to\n  external actions to trigger a workflow. For example, you can use a\n  Folder Action script to initiate automated processing of any photo\n  dropped in a targeted folder. A well written Folder Action script\n  leaves the hot folder empty. This avoids repeated application of the\n  action to the same files, and allows Folder Actions to perform more\n  efficiently.\nYou can Control-click a folder to access some Folder Action features\n  with the contextual menu in the Finder. Or you can use the Folder\n  Actions Setup application, located in /Applications/AppleScript.\n\nNote: you can create your own 'Folder Actions' using AppleScript Editor or Automator.\n", "Q: Two different audio inputs go to two different audio outputs on Mavericks Is it possible to have two different audio sources go to two different audio outputs? For example, can I have Spotify output through my mini Jambox while having YouTube videos play through my headphones plugged into my audio jack?\nI've seen this question but it seems to only address the case of multiple inputs to one output or one input to multiple outputs. Same with this article.\n\nA: Short answer is yes, it's possible; however, the application must allow this. Most applications default to the System defined audio output which is set in the System Sound Preferences (and can be further tweaked in the Audio/MIDI Setup app). Some apps have the capability to set there own independent output as well (for example, most audio apps (including Garageband) allow you to set it's own audio ins and outs (on a per channel basis)). \n", "Q: Difference in disk usage MS DOS vs Extended Journaled Searches on Google and the Apple forums didn't get me any answers or couldn't clarify this for me, hence this question.\nI have two following external USB hard drives connected to my iMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Lacie1\" with a capacity of 499.64GB, formatted as MS-DOS (FAT32)\n\n*\"Lacie2\" with a capacity of 499.76GB, formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\nI copied all of the contents from Lacie1 to Lacie2 and to see if everything was copied well, I opened the show info dialog of both drives and noticed that there is an enormous difference in used disk space between the two:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lacie1: 221.357.604.864 bytes (221,36GB)\n\n*Lacie2: 187.714.969.600 bytes (187,71GB)\n\n\nTo be sure I checked how many files are on each drive and they both contain 17297 parts.\nIs this because of the formatting of the drives that there is such a difference in disk usage or is there indeed a 'problem'?\nAny explanation is appreciated! :)\n\nA: FAT32 on a large drive has a larger block size that HFS+. This means that the small amount of \"wasted\" space per file is larger and therefore the same files will take up more space. It's because FAT32 only uses 28 bits for it's cluster index while HFS+ can use it's entire 32 bits.\nOne of the marvelous things about Steve Wozniak is that he designed a disk system for the Apple ][ that was both efficient, extensible and easily implemented and the original Macintosh File System (MFS) was built on top of his work after Wendell Sanders created a single chip implementation of Woz's drive controller the IWM chip. It was replaced by the Hierarchical File System (HFS) and then HFS+, otherwise known as Macintosh Extended.\n\nA: Not Necessarily.\nCheck out the article at support.apple.com titled:\niMovie '11: Copy or move a project to an external hard disk\nIn particular:\nNote:   To use an external hard disk with iMovie, it must be formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). iMovie doesn’t support network-attached storage or external flash memory drives.\nI was just surprised (just now actually) to find out that a thumb drive I use exclusively for OS X stuff was formatted for MSDOS (FAT32).\nThat was careless of me. LOL.\n", "Q: Can't delete file on external USB drive I am running Mavericks on a Mac Mini. I was attempting to move my iPhoto library to a different Mac by copying it onto an external USB drive. The iPhoto Library is 98GB.\nI left it running for 3 hours, when I came back it said it had 14 days to complete.  So I tried to cancel.  The Finder popup said \"Stopping...\" but stuck there.\nI have since rebooted the Mac but Finder says the file is still on the USB drive. If I tried to delete it again it just says \"Deleting...\" and then Finder freezes.\nIt seems like the iPhoto Library that I tried to copy is corrupted on the USB drive and now it can't be deleted.  Finder says the file is 98GB even though it still had 14 days to run.\nHow can I get rid of this file?\n\nA: Try deleting it with Terminal:\nrm -rf /Volumes/diskname/path/to/folder\n\nThis command will remove (forcefully and recursively) the path given. Be careful when entering the path to ensure you delete the correct folder, as there's no protection against deleting everything. Note that Terminal will show no progress whilst this is being carried out — the prompt will return when it's complete.\n\nA: If everything else fails, use the disk utility and reformat the USB drive. \nYou will lose all on the drive, but it is the last resort.\n\nA: You can attempt to remove the file using Terminal:\nrm -rf /Volumes/[DriveName]/[Path]\n\nOr if that fails format in Disk Utility. \n", "Q: Can I use an AppleTV when I travel off my home network? I have a first generation AppleTV and I am wondering if I take it on vacation and connect to an HDTV with an HDMI cable, will it enable me to pickup programming off the WiFi in my vacation are for viewing?\n\nA: \nYou may have an issue with the hotel wifi. Oftentimes hotel wifi networks require you to open a web browser to login and use the internet. The Apple TV doesn't have a web browser so you might not be able to login and use their wifi network\n\n@The Disco Spider\nHeres my WAY OVER complicated explanation to solve the issue of Hotel/Plane WiFi requiring you to use a Web Browser to login on a device that does not allow this type of authentication\nSome Info\n\n\n*\n\n*Most (All) Hotel WiFi networks that require you to login on a webpage by either agreeing to TOS, inputing your room number and last name, etc. authenticate using a MAC Address\n\n*It remembers that you were logged in by using a MAC address so if you leave for the day (disconnect) and come back later (reconnect) you do not have to login\n\n*MAC Addresses can be easily spoofed, allowing us to authenticate with the same MAC Address on a compatible device\n\n*This method could also be used to steal paid WiFi, so take the moral route and don't STEAL`\n\n\nGet MAC Address of the Apple TV (or other device)\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings -> General -> About -> WiFi Address\n\n\nGet WiFi interface and MAC Address (on your Mac)\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold Down Option key\n\n*Click on the WiFi Button in the Menu Bar\n\n*Write down the Address\n\n*Remember the Interface Name (either en0 or en1)\n\n\nNote: Disconnect the Apple TV/Device\nBegin the Hack\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ifconfig [INTERFACE NAME] ether [APPLE TV/DEVICE MAC ADDRESS] //Spoofs MAC address to Apple TV's MAC address\n\n*Turn off WiFi and turn WiFi back on\n\n*If a webpage does not open, open Safari and navigate to captive.apple.com to force the sign in page\n\n*After logging in, once more navigate to captive.apple.com if you receive a Success then you are good to go\n\n*sudo ifconfig [INTERFACE NAME] ether [ORIGINAL Mac's MAC ADDRESS] \\ Put back MAC address or you will have EXTREME connectivity issues\n\n*Turn off WiFI and turn WiFi back on\n\n*Turn WiFI on, on your Apple TV/Device\n\n\nThis should work as I have tested with an Apple TV, PS4, and many other devices.\nNote: This may not work in WPA3\n\nA: You may have an issue with the hotel wifi.  Oftentimes hotel wifi networks require you to open a web browser to login and use the internet.  The Apple TV doesn't have a web browser so you might not be able to login and use their wifi network.  You might want to bring it along and see if there's a wifi network or hardwired ethernet connection that will work.\n", "Q: Mac OS X / iTunes not recognizing iPod? I've plugged in a iPod into my iMac. I've plugged it to the back of the mac where the USB Ports are. It does charge the iPod but whenever i want to add music or delete music i can't since iTunes / My Mac won't recognize my device.\nCan anyone help me out here?\nFor anyone out there here's what a iPod Shuffle looks like : \n\nA: It may be a format issue. In non-iOS products, there's something called a format. If you originally synced it to a PC, then it won't sync with a Mac (and vise versa). The only way to sync it with the other computer is to format it. This (hopefully) won't be a problem because of iTunes in the cloud, which syncs your music throughout your computers. I hope this helps!\n"]
