I had installed Ubuntu 14.04.1-desktop-amd64, accidentally using the lvm option. After finding my 500 Gb hard drive stuck in lvm I started to find methods/GUI software to resize it. In the mean time my brother while trying to install windows 7 has deleted the lvm partition. Now I've nothing on my pc except GNU GRUB version 2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1 command line. I've tried to reinstall Ubuntu using a bootable usb but it is not booting. Is there any command for booting usb from GNU GRUB which says, \"Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported.

They are very similar, mate-terminal being a fork of gnome-terminal, and I'd be quite surprised if any problems arose from that difference; mate-terminal's features are a subset of those provided by gnome-terminal. Most importantly, both accept the same --tab-with-profile, -t, and -e options.\nA more detailed explanation of how the above code works, and why  chose that implementation, follows, in case you're interested.\n\nInstead of looping over the sequence 1 2 3 4 5, which is meaningless to the problem, I made the loop variable s, the value passed to ./new_path.py after -s. I also defined f and ensured it took on a value 200 greater than s in each iteration of the loop; this is the value passed to ./new_path.py after -f.\nThat made it easy to construct each iteration's cmd and title strings. (cmd is the value passed to gnome-terminal after -e, and title is the value passed after -t.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Making cmd was particularly simple. s and f could just appear in the string without modification, dereferenced as $s and $f within the double-quoted expression.\n\n*For title I noticed the leading zeros in your manually written strings (e.g., \"0593000_0593200\"). I inferred you probably want the title numbers zero-padded whenever they're fewer than seven digits, and used bash's printf builtin to achieve this.\n\n\nThere were several possible constructions to choose from, in writing the loop. In addition to the more common for variable in list syntax, bash supports C-style for with (( initialization; condition; increment-or-other-action)) syntax, which I decided to use.\nMy goals in deciding how to write the loop included:\n\n\n*\n\n*making it so that when the loop is modified later, each number can be changed in just one place (e.g., avoiding having 200 appear multiple times in the code), and\n\n*reflecting the logic of the underlying problem being solved.\n\n\nIn bash, sequences of numbers are usually best generated with {start..end..step} (or just {start..end} for contiguous sequences). But brace expansion is performed before shell parameter expansion, so start, end, and step cannot be variables (like $step).\nA for s in seq 593000 593800 $step loop (and setting f=$((s+step)) inside the loop) would've worked for this, and I would probably have done it that way if easy code maintenance were my only concern.\nBased on your original script, it seems the underlying problem being solved is, or is something like, this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Perform runs (of some experiment or calculation).\n\n*Vary some important parameter, whose starting and final values are specified to ./new_path.py via -s and -f.\n\n*The important parameter ranges from 593000 to 594000.\n\n*Vary sequentially in chunks of 200. Cover the range by running five such tasks in parallel.\n\n\nThis suggested it would be valuable to write the loop in such a way that the lowest -s value and highest -f value were specified (rather than the lowest and highest -s values). I used a C-style for ((...)) loop, which facilitated that in a reasonably concise and readable way.\nNote that this was not the only way to do it, nor is there any one \"Right Way.\" In particular, I could've instead defined step and max (and initialized s to its minimum value) before the loop, then used a while loop with arithmetic comparison (via (( with <=, or [[ with -le) in the condition.\nI made a few other changes, compared to your original script, by they are minor and entirely a matter of stylistic preference.\n\n\n*\n\n*I renamed options to args because \"options\" is often used specifically to mean flags (such as those starting with - and --) rather than all command-line arguments.\n\n*Since the += operator is being used to build an array of arguments rather than the final command string itself, no leading or trailing whitespace is needed in its elements. So I removed the leading space before --tab-with-profile.\n\n*In the flags passed to gnome-terminal, I changed --title to -t for consistency with the choice of -e. (-t is the short form of --title=; -e is the short form of --command=.) This also made it a little easier to read because it let $title be a separate array element instead of having to be combined into a string as \"--title=$title\".\n\n*I used sh -c ... instead of bash -c ... as the command passed to gnome-terminal, since the generic sh (which in Ubuntu is the simpler, lighter weight dash) is sufficient to the task of chaining two simple commands with ;. (I didn't change the bash after ; to sh, because the interactive shell that runs in each tab after ./new_path.py finishes should of course still be bash.)\nIn this context, this is definitely not a performance consideration, but just a matter of style. I am not suggesting that using sh -c instead of bash -c for this is the right way or that it is objectively preferable.\n", "Q: XFCE doesn't display menu I have lost controll over the workspace, the icons on the left have dissapered, I am unable to change the background and rightclicking mouse on screen dos'nt work eighter.\nI was trying to put some books on my ipad, it failed - books are there but they dont show up on bookshelf.\nAfter rebooting (trying to get Calibre to catch the ipad) the background image showed at login screen, but disapered when loging in - replaced with some big pixelated garbage.\nLoging in as gues, everything worked, and I could change background and interact with the screen  --  Rebooting and loging in as my self left the background picture,but the rest is still absent.\nWhich local settings should i correct?

This allows the system to use the monitor without having to reboot.\nA potential patch for this is to simply disable the extra monitor, unless needed. If you have a laptop, look for the \"Mirror Mode\" display. Hit it until the second monitor disappears.

Most probably it somehow got damaged, as otherwise filesystem would be recognized as swap.\nad 2) Command free shows you how much swap you have\nfree\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       3906656    1582008    2324648      78656      41176     916644\n-/+ buffers/cache:     624188    3282468\nSwap:      8892412          0    8892412\n\nIn this case it shows 8GB of swap, none of it's is used.\nYou may want to reactivate your swap partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that your partition /dev/sda7 does not contain any valuable data (most probably not)\n\n*Configure type of /dev/sda7 to id 82 (Linux swap / Solaris) you can use both gparted or fdisk to do so.\n\n*Format /dev/sda7 to be a valid swap mkswap /dev/sda7    \n\n*Activate the swap by swapon /dev/sda7\n\n*Additionally modify /etc/fstab to make swap start after every boot. The swap line will probably be already there. You will just need to update UUID received as output of 3.\n\n", "Q: Running .jar File using JDK on Ubuntu 14.04 I install JDK on my Ubuntu 14.04 so I can use Netbeans and Android studio. I download a .jar file in the internet and I want to run it on my PC. My problem is, I cannot find java to run this file. I already allow executing file as a program. Do I need to install Java Run time? Cause, as far as it is said here, JDK already contains JRE. https://stackoverflow.com/a/1906455\n\nA: You should be able to run Java jar files in terminal by running java -jar path/to/jar. Note that some jar files only print things out; they don't display a window.\n\nA: It depends on how you installed it.  If you're going for \"My workspace is portable.  So I just extract zips/archives everywhere\" then you need to check out update-alternatives:  \nschadenfreude@oubliette:~$ update-alternatives --display java\njava - auto mode\n  link currently points to /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java\n\n", "Q: directories under /proc directory when I tried $ ls /proc ,I found a lot of directories(numbered - for PID and other subdirectories...) as follows : \nI am describing only some of the numbered subdirectories,and other subdirectories\n$ ls /proc\n 129   1475  1899  2     21    2302 (PID's-correct me if i am wrong)\n acpi ,asound, bus,driver, fs, ipmi ,irq , mounts , net ,scsi ,self,sys, sysvipc,tty(other subdirecories ), \n\nand when I tried $ ls - l /proc it displayed some -> character in it :\n$ ls -l /proc\nlrwxrwxrwx.  1 root       root                    11 Sep  7 17:06 mounts -> self/mounts \nlrwxrwxrwx.  1 root       root                     8 Sep  7 17:06 net -> self/net\nlrwxrwxrwx.  1 root       root                     0 Sep  7  2014 self -> 4806\n\nHere in Access Specifier full access is there(lrwxrwxrwx),my question is:\nwhat does l specify here in lrwxrwxrwx\nwhat does these -> character means? like in(mounts -> self/mounts , net -> self/net,self -> 4806 etc.)\n\nA: The presence of -> means that that \"entry\" in the directory is a symbolic link (symlink) to a file/directory somewhere else. In this case, /proc/mounts is a symlink to /proc/self/mounts.\nSymlinks typically have a permission of 0777, since it isn't the one allowing/restricting access to a file/directory (hence, the rwxrwxrwx). However, whatever permissions are on the file/directory still do come into effect, so if a file has permissions 0600 or rw-------, then only the user owning the file can read or write into it, either directly or through a symlink.\nI'm not entirely sure on the l, but my guess is that it's an indication that that entry is a symlink.\n", "Q: Will my OS be formatted if I partition my home directory in recovery mode? Will my OS be formatted if I partition my home directory in recovery mode? The question is for Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Asumming the root partition (/ partition) is installed on a separate  partition, the answer is no, you should be fine to go! Just to make sure take a look at the fstab file with the command: cat /etc/fstab just to give you a example you should look for something like:\n /dev/sda1 /\n/dev/sda2 /home\n\nor\nUUID=a /\n\nUUID=b /home\n\nwhere a is not equal to b.\n", "Q: Why is this rsync + ssh cron job giving me 'Permission denied (publickey)' errors? I make frequent backups to a local drive which I want to sync daily to a remote server.\nThe target server is configured for SSH key (no password) access only. Since my primary SSH key for that server is passphrase-protected, I've created a second SSH key (not passphrase protected) + user to use for unattended backups - this way I do not have to be present to enter my passphrase when cron runs.\nI'm using cron and rsync, and all of the commands work individually, but fail when combined.\nThe furthest I've got while troubleshooting is running\nenv -i sh -c \"rsync -lrstRO --delete --exclude 'lost+found' /Backups/auto-daily-backups/./ backups-only@XX.XX.XX.XX:/backups/desktop/\"\n\nwhich returns the error \nPermission denied (publickey).\nrsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]\nrsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.c(226) [sender=3.1.0]\n\nAny tips on how to troubleshoot this further?\n\nHere's what I've tried so far and I'm out of ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cron is definitely running ps aux | grep cron\n\n*Nothing unusual in /var/log/syslog Sep  7 13:22:01 desktop CRON[6735]: (tom) CMD (sh /home/tom/Documents/Scripts/offsite-backup)\n\n*SSH in Terminal to remote server as the backup user works ssh backups-user@XX.XX.XX.XX\n\n*Running the command in Terminal works perfectly rsync -lrstRO --delete --exclude 'lost+found' /Backups/auto-daily-backups/./ backups-only@XX.XX.XX.XX:/backups/desktop/\n\n*Manually specifying the path to the backups-user key has no effect rsync -lrstRO --delete --exclude 'lost+found' -e 'ssh -i /home/tom/.ssh/backups-only' /Backups/auto-daily-backups/./ backups-only@XX.XX.XX.XX:/backups/desktop/\n\n*Replacing the non-functioning command with a simple test command works echo \"Hello world\" > ~/Desktop/test.txt\n\n*Shouting/swearing at the computer had no effect (but made me feel better temporarily).\n\nEdit 1:\nHere's my crontab file and the script it calls.\n...\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\nMAILTO=\"\"\n* * * * * sh /home/tom/Documents/Scripts/offsite-backup\n\nand\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrsync -lrstRO --delete --exclude 'lost+found' /Backups/auto-daily-backups/./ backups-only@XX.XX.XX.XX:/backups/desktop/\n\n\nEdit 2:\nJust to clarify, /var/log/auth.log on the target server contains the line Sep 11 08:23:01 <hostname> CRON[24421]: pam_unix(cron:session): session closed for user root This is confusing because I'm no longer running cron every minute locally, but a new entry still appears every minute in the server logs. Crontab files for all users (including root) on the server are empty & do nothing.\nAlso, user 'backups-only' was created only on the server and with limited rights, with a dedicated SSH key copied to my desktop machine. I'm assuming this is the way to go because everything works when running the commands manually.\nThe crontab file posted above is for me, user 'tom' on my desktop machine. My intent is to have it call the script which should log in to the server as user 'backups-only'. I just tried running the backup script (rather than the command inside it) and it successfully connected & worked. I ran it on my desktop as user 'tom', same user who created the cron job that won't work. Here's the output from the server log corresponding with that successful login\nSep 11 08:35:31 <hostname> sshd[25071]: error: Could not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\nSep 11 08:35:32 <hostname> sshd[25071]: Accepted publickey for backups-only from <desktop IP> port 54242 ssh2: RSA e2:e6:07:27:c1:continues...\nSep 11 08:35:32 <hostname> sshd[25071]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user backups-only by (uid=0)\nSep 11 08:35:32 <hostname> systemd-logind[638]: New session 12 of user backups-only.\nSep 11 08:36:00 <hostname> sshd[25133]: Received disconnect from <desktop IP>: 11: disconnected by user\nSep 11 08:36:00 <hostname> sshd[25071]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user backups-only\n\n\nA: Since everything is working fine from the command line, the error Permission denied (publickey) means that the SSH part of rsync is using a different identity file than the specified username.\nFrom Jan's comment on the original question, we can specify the identity file in the rsync command using -e 'ssh -i /path/to/identity.file' ....\nUsing the below command to start off with a fresh environment in cron and specifying the complete path to the file apparently solves the issue:\nenv -i sh -c \"rsync -lrstRO --delete --exclude 'lost+found' -e 'ssh -i /home/tom/.ssh/backups-only' /Backups/auto-daily-backups/./ backups-only@XX.XX.XX.XX:/backups/desktop/\"\n\nI'm still really interested in this finding. It probably has to do with cron, the fact that it starts with minimal environment variables, and the ssh-agent. I'll be setting up the same scenario ina a couple of days to test it out and report back.\n\nA: I just have solved this problem that has kept me busy ..\nUnable to connect in RSYNC over SSH, despite having stipulated the identity for SSH ...Nothing is done ... \nRsync says \"permission denied\" and ssh tells me \"read_passphrase: can not open /dev/tty: No device or address of this type\"\nBut I read a post that explained that the crontab has its own environment that is not the same as root. I already knew that but I did not understand the impact it could have on SSH when using the SSH-AGENT\nBut my SSH key exchanges are done with PassPhrase ... so if the environment is different and my RSYNC over SSH expects a passphrase that can not be entered => SSH debug info also indicate the error:\n\n\"debug1: read_passphrase: can not open /dev/tty: No such device or\n  address\"\n  => Well yes no TTY = no passphrase = not allowed\n\nOn my machine I use \"Keychain\" to have the SSH agent launched so I do not have to reenter the passphrase every time I try a remote connection. Keychain generates a file that contains the following information\n\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK = /tmp/ssh-PWg3yHAARGmP/agent.18891;  export\n  SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID = 18893;  export SSH_AGENT_PID;\n\n==> The SSH-AGENT command returns the same info.\nSo, in the end, it is these information related to the current session that allow future authentications of the current session, without the need to enter the passphrase because already done previously and memorized ...\n==> The solution is there ... it is enough in the script launched by the crontab, and to \"source\" the file containing this information or to do it on the command line ds the crontab ...\n\nexample: 14 09 * * *. /home/foo/.keychain/foo.serveur.org-sh && scp\n  -vvv -P 22 /tmp/mon_fic/toto.sh foo@my-server.fr :. >> / var / log / check_connexion.log 2> & 1 or use the command \"source\n  /home/foo/keychain/foo.server.org-sh\" in the script that starts a\n  connection using SSH.\n\n=> With this sourcing, no more worry. The information of SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID are loaded in the environment of the Crontab and are therefore known, the RSYNC over SSH works without any problem.\nIt has kept me busy but now, it works :)\n\nA: Caveat for those who use SSH Agent Forwarding:\nIf you see this behaviour when debugging a script on a remote host, it's because even with the -e \"ssh -i /path/to/key\" flag, ssh will use your local (forwarded) key rather than the one on the server.\nConcrete example: I have a script on the dev server that pulls in data from the \"data server\" using rsync over ssh. When I log into the dev server and run it, all is well, but when running from cron, I get the permission denied. Adding some verbosity to the SSH process (flag -vv) I noticed the following:\ndebug2: key: /home/nighty/.ssh/id_rsa (0x562d8b974820),\ndebug2: key: /home/juanr/.ssh/id_rsa (0x562d8b962930), explicit\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password\ndebug1: Next authentication method: publickey\ndebug1: Offering RSA public key: /home/nighty/.ssh/id_rsa\ndebug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply\ndebug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen 279\ndebug2: input_userauth_pk_ok: fp 1a:19:08:9f:80:16:b1:db:55:42:9a:52:b2:49:9b:0a\ndebug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).\n\nWhat clued me off here is that by pure chance, I happen to have a different username on the local host (\"nighty\") than on the dev server (\"juanr\").\nNotice how it marks the key on the dev server as \"explicit\", but still uses the forwarded key from my laptop to log in. Doing an ssh-copy-id at this point resolves nothing, because it simply reinstalls the forwarded key rather than the one from the dev server. If you use ssh-copy-id with agent forwarding, you need to specify which key to install with the -i flag: ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@host.\n\nA: A little late to the party, but I had the same issue. Local user crontab -l showed my daily backup task:\n  0   5   *    *    5    /repos/local-bin/backup-backups daily-6\n\nWorked when I called /repos/local-bin/backup-backups daily-6 directly. Worked when I called the underlying rsync command by itself. Worked when I ssh-ed into the systems I was attempting to back up. ssh-add -l showed my environment's agent/keychain had the keys I needed stored properly and readily available.\nSo, following the advice of the main answer, I added env to /repos/local-bin/backup-backups, made the cron task run immediately, copied the output from env, added export before each of the lines, opened up a new terminal, ran env -i sh, and pasted the export commands into it. Then I ran my ssh command from earlier and it failed. Finally! I noticed that the cron environment was receiving a pid for an ssh agent, though, so it should be working...\nI ran ssh-add -l, saw that the latest SSH keys I created weren't added to this environment's agent/keychain... but some of my other keys were?? Which is weird, because it was working with the agent I was using outside of this environment... oh wait! I'm using KDE's wallet/agent outside of this (my desktop) environment, and using ssh-agent directly inside of this environment (my terminal environment)! So I pressed Ctrl+Alt+F2 to drop out of KDE, ran ssh-add -l, saw that it, too, was missing the keys I needed, and ran my add-ssh-keys script. Normally this is done automatically around boot/login time, but these were newly minted SSH keys that needed to be added to both my KDE keychain (which I had done properly) and my non-KDE ssh-agent (which I forgot to do). Hopefully this helps someone else avoid a few hours of hair pulling :)\n\nA: Have you already tried the old trick of cleaning up the hosts files? \nI mean:\nrm ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nIt's worth trying as ssh will rebuild it and you will get rid of stale stuff. You can of course also remove the parts belonging to a given IP / Host.\nMore questions: Is your cron job running under your UID or is it running as user cron or root?\n\nA: Use the rrsync script together with a dedicated ssh key as follows:\nREMOTE server\nmkdir ~/bin\ngunzip /usr/share/doc/rsync/scripts/rrsync.gz -c > ~/bin/rrsync\nchmod +x ~/bin/rrsync\n\nLOCAL computer\nssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_remote_backup -C \"Automated remote backup\"      #NO passphrase\nscp ~/.ssh/id_remote_backup.pub devel@10.10.10.83:/home/devel/.ssh\n\nREMOTE computer\ncat id_remote_backup.pub >> authorized_keys\n\nPrepend to the newly added line the following\ncommand=\"$HOME/bin/rrsync -ro ~/backups/\",no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding\n\nSo that the result looks like\ncommand=\"$HOME/bin/rrsync -ro ~/backups/\",no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding ssh-rsa AAA...vp Automated remote backup\n\nLOCAL \nPut in your crontab the following script with x permission:\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"\"\necho \"\"\necho \"CRON:\" `date`\nset -xv\nrsync -e \"ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_remote_backup\" -avzP devel@10.10.10.83:/ /home/user/servidor \n\nSource: http://www.guyrutenberg.com/2014/01/14/restricting-ssh-access-to-rsync/\n\nA: To try and debug add to the ssh part \"ssh -v\" this way you can get verbose mode with some helpful information.\nEdit: From the man page:\n-v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh to print debugging messages about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,\n             authentication, and configuration problems.  Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.\n\n\nA: I think you haven't configured the sshd_config file properly. Verify that PermitRootLogin yes and PubkeyAuthentication yes  for remote maintenance.\n", "Q: Boot Windows 8 from another disk I'm trying to add a Windows 8 SSD to the boot menu.

I have an app that I am trying to get the toolbar in the header to work. In the documentation I've noticed a property called head that seems to create and add items to the header toolbar.\nWhat is the difference between this and the toolbaritems?\nAlso, related, in trying to use this head property, I get the error: Cannot assign to non-existent property \"head\" (similar to question Why am I getting the error “Cannot assign to non-existent property ”head\"?)\nWhich one is the correct (or better) way?\nThank you\nRandy\n\nA: toolbaritems has been deprecated in Ubuntu.Components 1.1, so its use is strongly discouraged. It is maintained for backward compatibility, but the right way to add items to the header toolbar is now using head.actions.\nThe main difference between head.actions and toolbaritems is that you don't need anymore to add ToolbarButton items and then set their action property. All you need with head.actions is to specify a list of actions and then they will be automatically shown according to Ubuntu Touch patterns.\nAn example that shows how to use head property is the following (from official documentation):\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.1\n\nMainView {\n     width: units.gu(48)\n     height: units.gu(60)\n     Page {\n         title: i18n.tr(\"Example page\")\n         Label {\n             anchors.centerIn: parent\n             text: i18n.tr(\"Hello world!\")\n        }\n        head.actions: [\n             Action {\n                 iconName: \"search\"\n                 text: i18n.tr(\"Search\")\n             },\n             Action {\n                 iconName: \"contacts\"\n                 text: i18n.tr(\"Contacts\")\n             }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nThere are some other useful settings for PageHead (e.g. custom Item to show instead of the title), so I'd suggest you to take a look at this page.\nIf you are running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, these new APIs are not available, due to their dependence on Qt 5.3.

It only happens with Ubuntu so it has to be something in their OS causing it.  Any ideas would be appreciated.\n\nA: I have the same issue with this laptop and Ubuntu. A workaround is to always turn the laptop off and then turn it on instead of rebooting.

I don't know (yet) how fans speed is being regulated so I may be wrong...\n\nA: Add acpi_osi=linux to the Linux commandline in /etc/default/grub configuration file.\nThen run sudo update-grub to apply changes and reboot.\nThat will fix the fan issues and backlight problems. \nDo NOT use 3rd party tools to control the fans on this laptop. \n\nA: To be sure, please ensure that you're running the latest BIOS for your laptop.\nYou can download it from here: http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&m=G750JM&p=3&s=521\nCopy the .fd file to a FAT32 formatted USB drive, power down your laptop, insert the dongle, press Esc to enter startup menu, launch Enter Setup and flash the BIOS with EasyFlash. This will update the BIOS from the EFI environment.\nIt is NOT recommended to update system BIOS from within Windows. If it fails in Windows, you WILL brick your notebook. However, in EFI mode, should any part of the update fail (e.g verifying checksums), it will halt the upgrade and revert to the previous version.\nThe new BIOS' release notes are as follows:\n1.Fix the bug that Fn+F8 has no function under Windows 7.\nThis is an ACPI related fix that updates the DSDT tables that WMI aware Operating Systems (e.g Windows 7) can use to adjust SMI triggered events such as hotkeys, backlight controls, etc.\nAn older revision of the BIOS (R205) reconfigures the thermal policy, and this fix is also valid for the new BIOS image.\n", "Q: UnetBootin Issues I just built a computer, I am trying to install ubuntu 14.04 live x64, although I am having some issues.

That suggests that there is no wireless interface yet, implying that the hardware and an appropriate driver haven't yet combined. Check:\niwconfig\n\nDo you see an interface wlan0? If not, we'll investigate the hardware and see if we can load a driver.

Now the printer works almost fine.\nMy problem is that PDF files are printed as black pages. More precisely, the output is a black rectangle sormounted by some fuzzy lines.\nIt happens independently of the PDF reader I try to use (built-in Chromium reader or Evince). I tried printing PDF into another PDF and the result is fine. Ghostscript is correctly installed and test pages are correctly printed too. Other filetypes like djvu are correctly printed, so it appears as a specifically PDF issue.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this issue?\nUPDATES. Also PostScript files behave like PDF.\n\nA: Partial solution. Canon CAPT drivers README suggestes it's better to use Acrobat Reader for printing PDF files. This is a working, not fully satisfactory, solution. It should be noted one has to set \"Let the printer determine colors\" in \"Advanced\" tab (left bottom corner of the printing acroread form), otherwise the output will have swapped colours: black for the background, white for the text.\nRemark 1. So far I've not yet tested whether other readers print well since I've wasted a fair amount of toner and I need it now. Since it's quite annoying being compelled to use Acrobat Reader (which has a ridiculous printing system for multiple pages), please let me know about your experiences with other readers. \nRemark 2. Installing acroread do not cause changes in default Ghostscript driver nor in available Ghostscript drivers.\nRemark 3. acroread doesn't support opening PostScript files, so I couldn't verify whether issue is fixed for them.\n", "Q: Bluetooth disabled and not showing up in LSPCI - ASUS G750JM The modem installed properly on 14.04, it worked on installation of ubuntu.

Unfortunately, I misspelled the path, and I lost the file Ubuntu.\nsudo mv /media/creator/sumeeth/software/apache-tomee-1.7.0-plus.tar.gz /~ \n\n\nA: You did not delete the file. You just moved it into /~ (assuming the command did not return any error). Files on Linux can contain any strange characters.

I've recently downloaded a package with .bundle extension. it's VMware-Player-6.0.3-1895310.x86_64.bundle. I want to install vmware-player, but when I open that, it opens with text editor.\n\nA: How to find out what kind of file it is?\nThe .bundle files for VMware Player, Workstation, and other products are actually shell scripts, with embedded binary data. You can discover or verify this with the file utility, which is handy for finding out what kind of file something (probably) is:\nek@Ilex:~$ file VMware-Player-6.0.3-1895310.x86_64.bundle\nVMware-Player-6.0.3-1895310.x86_64.bundle: a /usr/bin/env bash script executable (binary data)\n\nHow to use the file, based on this information?\nYou can make it executable with chmod, then run it:\nchmod +x VMware-Player-6.0.3-1895310.x86_64.bundle\nsudo ./VMware-Player-6.0.3-1895310.x86_64.bundle\n\n(If it's the only .bundle file in your current directory, you can just use chmod +x *.bundle and ./*.bundle. Or type the first few characters of the filename and press Tab, and the shell will type the rest out for you.)\nWhy sudo?\nVirtualization software, such as VMware products, must be installed as root. This is why I put sudo at the start of the second line. (In contrast to virtualization, emulators not employing any virtualization may generally be installed and used by a limited user, without any action by root.)\nWhy is plain sudo okay here, when the installer is graphical?\nVMware product installers are graphical (at least for part of the installation). Although it's generally recommended to avoid running a graphical program with sudo program (preferring gksudo program or sudo -H program), in this case it should be fine:\n\n\n*\n\n*The VMware Player installer, and executable installers in general, are unlikely to attempt to write configuration files to the home directory of the user running them.\n\n*And even if they did, the configuration files would pertain to the installer itself--they wouldn't prevent programs from being run normally by the limited user because you're unlikely to want to run such an installer as a non-root user.\n\n\nA: First be warned, installing files from outside of Ubuntu repository may compromise the system. VMware is probably safe, but it still should be mentioned.\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to change permission of the file to make it executable:\nchmod a+x VMware-Player-6.0.3-1895310.x86_64.bundle\n\n\n*Start the file. You will most probably need root privileges to install VMWare, but that is not always the case. So in this case:\nsudo ./VMware-Player-6.0.3-1895310.x86_64.bundle\n\n", "Q: Make the CTRL and Super/CMD keys behave like on OS X I am a longtime OS X user who is using Ubuntu at work. While I like Ubuntu very much, something that I really miss is the behavior of the CTRL & CMD (i.e. Super) keys on OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*CMD/Super is used for most GUI shortcuts, such as copy/pasting, closing windows, ...\n\n*CTRL is mainly used for entering control keys in the terminal, i.e. CTRL+C generates a SIGINT.\n\n\nWhile working in a terminal I can still use the same shortcuts for copying and pasting. I find this immensely practical. On Ubuntu I have to use the mouse and the contextual menu.\nIs there any way I can make these keys behave like on OS X?\n\nA: Here's how I've done it on my MAC book running Kubuntu : \n\n\n*\n\n*Use xmodmap to swap command key and ctrl key globally.\na) Put the following in a file ~/.Xmodmap  \nclear control  \nclear mod4  \n\nkeycode 105 =  \nkeycode 206 =  \n\nkeycode 133 = Control_L NoSymbol Control_L  \nkeycode 134 = Control_R NoSymbol Control_R  \nkeycode 37 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L  \n\nadd control = Control_L  \nadd control = Control_R  \nadd mod4 = Super_L  \n\nb) Run the following command : \n$ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap \n\nThis will make all your application use Command + .. instead of ctrl + .. except terminal\nRemember, your command key is now ctrl key\n2.

Disable Meta key from invoking the app launcher  [ kubuntu only ]\nAdd the following to ~/.config/kwinrc\n[ModifierOnlyShortcuts]  \nMeta=\n\n\nA: You actually CAN use the Cut/Copy/Paste-Hotkeys in a terminal: You just have to additionally use the Shift key:\nCopy: Ctrl+Shift+C\nPaste: Ctrl+Shift+V\nCut: Ctrl+Shift+X\n\nSome command editing shortcuts:\nDelete one word: Alt+Backspace\nMove cusrsor one word left/right: Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→\n\nIf you want to use the Super key as a modifier, there is no possibility to do so in GTK-based desktop environments.

I (regrettably) upgraded my desktop to Ubuntu 14.04 but have been disappointed in performance of certain applications. \nIs it possible to download any software so that I can use 13.04 even though it is no longer supported?\n\nA: You can still use unsupported software, the only problem is that you wont recive official updates. But it's possible. One of the problems is that it's less secure than an up-to date version. \nBut I would install 12.04 in the meantime until 14.04 becomes more stable for you.

I'm using firefox to browse the web and it worked properly but just a few days ago after I used sudo apt-get upgrade and sudo apt-get update it keeps telling me to install flashplugin. I even reinstalled my flashplugin but it still doesn't work. What should I do ?!\n\nA: You need to\n\n\n*\n\n*enable Canonical's partner package repository,\n\n*check for new package updates (sudo apt-get update), and\n\n*install adobe-flashplugin .\n\n\n(source)\n\nA: You can get the newest version of flash player to firefox.

Here some people have made distributions based on Ubuntu and they're charging a price for it. Is this legal?\n\nA: Yes, it is ok to sell them.  However, a seller must provide full source code for the components covered under a license of that type.  Link.  Proprietary software, if it qualifies, doesn't have to provide full source code but most of the components that they would be selling would be free and open source software so they would have to provide source on demand.  And with the source you can compile it yourself.\nAlso, Red Hat sells RHEL and provides \"source code\" that has had all their patches merged into it without providing details of what specific patches were merged.  That is within the letter of the GNU license but is not in the spirit.  They also only provide source to their distribution, no binaries so if you want RHEL without paying for a license you either compile it all yourself or use a clone like CentOS.\n", "Q: I have two cursors on my screen, one of which is always on top and will never move - how do I remove it?

I have couple of conserns I need to find solutions for.\n\n\n*\n\n*DHCP server\n\n*\n\n*I have now installed a DHCP server (in Virtual Box Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) and it worked. Here's how I did it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vc6-0smd64\n\n\n*Bandwidth management\n\n\n*\n\n*Possibly with the DHCP server, can I get some sort of statistics of the network such as current bandwidth usage per device. I'd be great to see network usage per device or in this case a player. That would make it a heck of a lot easier to track down bandwidth eaters aka \"torrenting\" since there is not a lot of bandwith to just give away. \n\n*I installed app called EtherApe to the DHCP server, selected eth0 as the Interface and it shows connections, but it would be very hard to track down a single pc out there, because EtherApe also lists the target. I'd like it to be like a list, possibly in ubuntu Terminal. For example: \n\n*user@hostname $ any command that outputs this\n| PC |     LAN      | Current usage | Total usage / |\n| -- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------- |\n| 1  | 192.168.1.20 |    4.687 Mbps |     1.256 Gbps |\n| 2  | 192.168.1.21 |    12.57 Mbps |    103.25 Mbps |\n| 3  | 192.168.1.23 |    0.245 Mbps |    12.144 Mbps |\n\n\n\n*Block connection\n\n\n*\n\n*If player is using too much data all the time, having 20 tabs of Youtube playing 4K or torrenting a lot of files then block internet for that lan ip. This function should be used as manual because I could just kindly ask for the player to stop or I cut down the internet.\n\n*user@hostname $ blockinternet [lan ip] [interval]\nAlso if all of this could be done without proxy server then Ubuntu really rocks. Proxyless so players feel like home when they come. Plug and play. No proxy settings needed to be done. These features are not required to make a lan party but if someone starts to DDoS or torrent I would be great to have a tool to ban that PC for like 10 minutes (via SSH obviously ;)\nI know this a lot to ask, but I have googled for couple days now still without a solution. \nThanks!\n\nA: I'm not sure of a way to manage this with just a ubuntu server installation but what i would recommend is using a managed cisco swtich. You can find powerful used cisco switches on ebay for as little $30 with 24 ports and configure your own security guidelines and remotely shut of ports if needed. For monitoring your network you can use software like Solarwinds This kind of stuff can be overwhelming to get working and also not cost effective for your budget. Using a managed switch is the only way i see you getting the level of control you want.\n\nA: Managed switch will give you visibility of total traffic on your LAN per device.  Your local DHCP server can't see all the traffic (since that is what a switch does, only send the right traffic to the right port), so will never be able to do the job.\nYou won't find a 48 port Gigabit managed switch for $US30 though.\nSince you're probably not worried about local LAN traffic bandwidth if you're all Gbit, you only need to manage the internet traffic.\nThere are lots of tools for that. The device will need two network ports or 2 vlans, one to LAN, one to Internet.\nSomething like pfSense firewall (loads of features, lots of plugins), or a trick hardware router.  For a nice per-user gui, an Internet Cafe type appliance might work.  For just monitoring, Cacti will give you per-user and per-application traffic.\nYou can associate users with MAC addresses so you don't need an authenticating proxy.\nYou might want to enable a squid transparent proxy though, this will save you bandwidth.\nIf your firewall or appliance has layer 7 or QoS capabilities you can throttle or block the torrents and prioritise the gaming apps, as well as measure the latency and view the hogs.\n", "Q: Error with dpkg When I try to install anything, I get an error.\nex:\ndiego@diego-Satellite-C655:~$ sudo apt-get install spotify-client\nReading package lists...

I had to use rEFInd to get it to attempt to boot to the old (Snow Leopard, I think) OS partition, which will spin endlessly and never complete. At this point all I want to do is get some files off of the \"Macintosh HD\" partition from a user folder, which is of course restricted by default. chmod'ing the directory does not work because the partition mounts read-only, which I've recently discovered is because that volume is journaled, but that is what I'm trying to fix. I'm not an advanced linux user, so I'm sure there are utilities I could be using that I'm unaware of and my google fu hasn't lead me to.\nFirst, sudo mount -t hfsplus -o rw,remount -force /dev/sda2 /media/mac (of course after first unmounting /dev/sda2 from the default /media/ME/Macintosh HD mount point) did not have an effect. However, adding the following line to my fstab\nUUID=61ba4438-95d6-39e5-8d60-0735e28dc132 /media/mac               hfsplus    defaults 0   2\ndid manage to successfully change the mount point to /media/mac, but sadly it is still read only according to the error message I get trying to run chmod on it. \nI ran fsck -f /dev/sda2 and got this output:\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\n** /dev/sda2\n** Checking HFS Plus volume.\n** Checking Extents Overflow file.\n** Checking Catalog file.\n** Volume check failed.\nEDIT 2:Note that I had to use the -f, running it without that tells me that the utility cannot be run because the volume is journaled. More on that below...\nThe Mac Disk Manager Utility (which I get to through the Mavericks install boot) reports some permissions errors, but the drive is also read only there, so it can't fix them! If someone thinks they might now how to help me, I can get the output from that process. \nAny pointers would be appreciated. \nEdit: a little more research has led me to understand a bit more about the root of the problem. According to various installation guides, Mavericks requires you to move to a Journaled file system. So, I'm betting during the failed installation it started (and likely finished) this conversion before something (else?) went wrong. All my research is also telling me that Ubuntu (and I presume other Linux distros) does not support mounting a journaled file system in read/write mode. There is a link to a proposed process for removing the journaling from Ubuntu In this UbuntuForums thread, and I'm probably going to wind up giving that a shot as painful as it sounds, but I was hoping someone could propose any other methods for either removing journaling or getting the data out of the restricted directory another way. For example, I tried using the data recovery tool in gParted with no luck. \n\nA: It looks like all you want to do is read files from the system, so in this case, it doesn't matter (for you) that you can't mount this HFS+ partition as writable.  All you need to do is read from it.\nSo, mount it as you have been doing, and copy files from it using sudo, eg\nsudo cp -av /media/mac/some-dir /home/you/some-other-dir\n\n\nEdit: I realise you were assuming that you couldn't read files belonging to users from a foreign system - but you can.  With superuser rights you can read any file on a locally mounted partition.\nNote that it's also possible to specify as a mount option that any users/permissions on the drive should be ignored and instead everything should be treated as belonging to a particular user using the mount options uid=n,gid=n where n is your user and group ID on the system.  This will allow you to set up a mount where you have access to everything without sudo (though I have never tried this on an HFS partition).\n", "Q: Cannot Execute program binary go-enc2ly I've been Attempting to execute a \"go-enc2ly\", which is command line way of converting .enc encore files into lilypond format.

Could you please tell me the specs of your computer i.e hardisk space, model e.t.c also the current operating system installed on it.\n Well a windows operating system is currently installed on it well it as simple as partioning your hard disk to make space for ubuntu, downloading your ubuntu iso , using Unetbootin to create a bootable Usb (USB has to to be at least 2GB) and installing the ubuntu iso image into the USB using Unetbootin. When that is done just restart your computer (while keeping the bootable usb you just created connected to your computer at during the whole process) , I dont know what your key is but just after the computer starts to boot up just press Escape (That's what i do anyways) select BIOS menu Navigate to where it says Boot Device or something like that ,make usb to be the first item on list, save and exit . It should boot you up to the Ubuntu setup . The installation of ubuntu should detect that you have Windows installed on you computer and ask you if it should be installed side-by-side or should delete windows and install ubuntu only (you should know what to choose).\n When its done whenever you boot up it should ask you what OS you want to boot up to. \n  Edit How to partion your hard disk Visit http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg309170.aspx\n", "Q: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS Server Edition information need I was wondering what's the maximum RAM, and maximum CPUs does the Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS Server Edition can handle.

I freshly installed Ubuntu on my computer a few days ago to run an exclusive program. I finished with it, and I was about to format the drive to reinstall Windows. However, my little brother wanted to run this command in the terminal on it which would destroy the OS, and I thought that it would not hurt  since I would be formatting the drive anyway. \nIt was this: \nsudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /\n\nExcuse my noobiness if this command is supposed to end the world or something. So it screwed up the OS and I rebooted the PC with the Windows setup USB, planning to format the drive in Windows Setup.\nHowever, upon restart, the monitor was not receiving any input at all. Also, the HDD indicator (or whatever the red light was) wasn't doing one thing. (It was off, in fact.) The fans were working and the DVD drive was, though. (I don't think that there is a PC speaker in there, so if you need some beep error codes, sorry.) \nI tried switching the VGA cable from the graphics card to the motherboard, but I still got no input. I tried inserting this old Windows XP disk into the disk drive, but nothing showed up. Mashed the Delete, F12, etc. buttons, but nothing happened. I then looked online and tried a suggestion to reseat the RAM, but nothing changed. I'm thinking of resetting the CMOS manually but haven't gotten to it yet. (Please tell me if you were going to recommend doing so, because I don't want to screw up the PC if I don't have to.)\nI have UEFI so I may be able to use a backup chip in case the BIOS is corrupted. \n\nA: This is possible on a UEFI system running systemd.\n\n\n*\n\n*Phoronix: In A UEFI World, \"rm -rf /\" Can Brick Your System\n\n*Systemd bug report, source of that article\n\n\nTo summarize, quoting a comment from that bug report:\n\nPoint 1:\n  Deleting /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/ should thrash your EFI\n  configuration, but in a properly implemented EFI this should be\n  recoverable.\nPoint 2:\n  There is some pieces hardware out there with broken/poorly implemented\n  EFI, which will can be permanently bricked by doing standard conform\n  stuff to them. See for example the case where Ubuntu bricked some\n  Samsung laptops by storing additional data in some EFI memory. This\n  behaviour was fine by standard but broke this particular\n  implementation.\nPoint 3:\n  Running anything as root that writes to /dev/sda will destroy your\n  partition table and/or filesystems. That's bad especially if you have\n  no backup, but after partitioning, creating new filesystems and\n  reinstalling your OS your machine will work again. So you can recover\n  from it by booting some other media and redo your installation.\nPoint 4:\n  Thrashing your EFI is a whole different kind of problem. In the worst\n  case you won't be able to do anything with the machine as it will not\n  get to POST. No booting from an other media, no entering some EFI\n  utility to fix missing stuff. A that point your computer is a really\n  expensive paperweight.\n\nThe problem occurs in distributions that run systemd and mount efivarfs writeable (at /sys/firmware/efi/efivars). Systemd needs to write there, so distributions using systemd are affected. However, there seems to be no indication that Upstart systems are affected.\n\nA: There is no way that deleting files would destroy the drive, normally (see my edit at end - apparently, there is a way). The command is the same as entering del -s c:*.* in Windows command line (if my DOS syntax memory is correct). Of course deleting the OS will cause the OS to fail, but nothing more. \nIf you delete the boot directory along with anything else, even the entire partition, you should still actually get a GRUB prompt. The GRUB bootloader would not get erased because it's not a part of the directory structure, but its menu is, so it should still try to load and give an error.\nYou have some other problem, and it has nothing to do  with Ubuntu. Even if the disk failed, that wouldn't affect the USB or DVD boot process.\nEDIT:  OK, I think my answer is outdated due to UEFI BIOS, which is something i know little about.  Apparently, it is possible to delete critical UEFI configuration information.  I believe what happens is that this  gets mounted onto the filesystem, and if done incorrectly, will not be read only, and can be erased, thereby erasing it from the BIOS.\n\nA: Running the command rm -rf / can brick any UEFI device (including the one I am typing from). Doing this deletes all the files which includes mounted drives and EFI firmware variables (this is what bricks). Linux mounts the EFI variables in /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/, and rm -rf / will delete all the files (EFI variables) in that folder. Your computer is most likely a brick and cannot be fixed (EFI uses NVRAM).\nOld BIOS computers do not brick for rm -rf /, because they do not have EFI firmware variables which could be deleted. Also, it is possible to do the same thing (delete all EFI variables) on Windows with a few lines of code.\n\nA: I've had the experience that a Windows Installer media may just hang if your HD is using a format Windows doesn't know about (like ext4).\nIn this case, you should run a Linux LiveCD with GParted (like this one), and format your hard drive to something like NTFS or FAT32 before trying to install Windows.\n\nA: The major issue here is that a filesystem can span devices. This includes anything mounted. It is a problem for UEFI. Heck, it is a problem for Android. And if you had a mounted camera, say, you have also deleted your DCIM contents, right?  So, what did you learn?  The manufacturer may be able to help you, and you may be able to flash by other means. \nWipe disks with dd if=/dev/zero next time, and deleting things frivolously will come back to bite you one day. It will all end in tears. You can actually do time for pranking someone like this, it is a little bit worse than del . in the root directory MS-DOS PC.\n", "Q: Play audio on Ubuntu Core!

Can I use USB? How can I change this?\n\nA: It sounds like you are using Windows. In order to write the file to a USB drive properly, a third-party application is required. Try using UNetBootIn, which will do all the steps automatically. Download the Windows version, then run it. Once it's been opened, select the file you downloaded from the Ubuntu website, and choose the flash drive you wish to install it to. Once it's finished installing, reboot using the flash drive as the boot source. (This may require editing the boot order in the BIOS settings -- make sure the flash drive is plugged in before powering on to enter BIOS settings.) Once the operating system for the Ubuntu installer loads, follow its instructions and read everything carefully before making  any decisions.\n", "Q: need a live cd to boot to ram I created a live cd using uck and want it to boot to ram by default.

Also I am a rookie when it comes to setting up ubuntu so more detailed instructions are needed.\n\nA: I've done this before, add the toram option to the grub/grub.cfg file, turning the \nlinux ... noeject noprompt --\nboot line into\nlinux ... noeject noprompt toram --\n\n\n*\n\n*If you've got the live iso on a usb drive with a FS that's writable it's a lot easier, just mount & edit the grub file.\n\n*If you're using a cd/dvd or just dd'ing the iso straight to a usb then you'll have to edit the iso file before writing it, changing the grub file first and then write to cd/usb. I once found a nice little gui program that could do that, could've been isomaster but not sure. Or extract files -> edit -> make new iso with anything like mkisofs, k3b, brasero, etc.\n(FYI, I can't recommend dd'ing an iso to usb, less than optimal and shreds the usb's MBR/fat) \nUsing the toram option is different from the regular overlayfs (formerly aufs?) that all Ubuntu (all Debian too?) live iso's use. This option copies all the needed data from the cd/dvd/usb into ram, so you can remove or edit the cd/usb, and generally run with ram FS read/write speeds (+2GB/sec) instead of cd/usb speeds (1-10MB/sec). But the expense is using up about a GB of ram.\n\nA: All live CDs \"boot to RAM\".\nThat is, for any volatile storage they use RAM.\nThis is technically achieved using a union filesystem such as aufs which allows you to mount a read-only filesystem (eg, the CD) and combine it with free RAM to enable writes, but the writes are gone when the computer is rebooted.  This may also be combined with a compressed filesystem (such as squashfs) so that the read-only filesystem can be compressed and thus fit more data.\nIf you have any specific needs in terms of how you want to mount the filesystem, you'll have to be more specific.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 wifi disconnect every 1-20 minutes I have recently upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (from 12.04) and my wifi keeps dropping out constantly between 1-20min.

OS fails to boot I have seen very similar topics and some solutions throughout the website. But I think none of the questions are asked along with enough details. So here I go.\nI wanted to Install Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS alongside with my Windows 8.1.\nWhen I got to the Installation type, I had a message saying \"There is no operating system detected\" which I realized later on surfing the web about my problem (I'll get to the point soon). So I was like \"I guess I have to check 'Something else', since it is the only option that doesn't erase information from my HDD\". So I checked the radiobox and stepped into next step which is about resizing and partitioning just to see what appears (I didn't really want to install Ubuntu before backing up Windows). Like I said, I was curious and wanted to see what I was going to see. \n\nAbove link is a picture of the step that caused all the problems in my opinion. I changed the sizes, tried to figure  out the way it works, played with values and stuff, but, I never hit the \"Install Now\" button. I said \"Okay it seems fair enough, I will install Ubuntu tomorrow after a little bit of research\". I press QUIT and I want to get back to Windows 8.1. I take out the Ubuntu DVD and reboot the computer. This is where it gets messy. I am facing a problem where I get an error message says \"EFI NETWORK 0 IPv4 and bla bla.\" So I start doing some research. I read all the related topics and the solutions were similar. Change the BIOS settings, disable UEFI mode, Enable security boot, disable security boot, check if HDD is detected or not and such. I tried everything. I spent 2 days trying to find right solution. So, clarify things, this is a simple explanation of what I think.\n1-I think I am having this problem because I changed the way HDD works and tried to partition it without having that much of knowledge about it. Clearly, even though you don't press install, it actually partitions the hard drive.\n2-I tried every possible solution, I still can't boot the PC. Here are the solutions I have tried so far:\n     -Change BIOS boot settings(Enable/Disable UEFI,Legacy Support). When I boot UEFI enabled, I get \"EFI Network 0 IPv4, No bootable device...\" kinda problem. When I boot Legacy Support enabled, It says \"no bootable device found, press any key to continue\".\n     -Check if HDD is detected(yes it is)\n     -Start on safe mode(it fails to boot)\nWhat I think is this:\nI think there are 2 possible solutions left to try. First, take out your HDD, plug into any other computer, back up your information, then install Windows again. My second possible solution is to try booting windows with an OS-installed USB. So Would I be able to boot the PC if I try this?\nMy question is:\nWhat is the real problem? Not having windows detected or having a broken HDD since I tried to partition it with no knowledge. \nAnother question is:\nIs there any hope that I can save my HDD without having to erasing all the information I have. Is it possible to save informations from it?\nMy computer is a Lenovo Y410P. So it has a security start button right by the fan. I hit that button and choose \"System recovery\". Still fails to boot. \nAdditional important informations I forgot to mention:\n\n\n*\n\n*I said I didn't hit the Install Now button. Actually I did. But it failed giving me an error message saying something like this \"mount point can't be the same bla bla\". I am not quite sure what the message was but it had something to do with mounting. Simple put, it never started installing.\n\n*I am able to boot my PC using \"Try Ubuntu without Installing it\" when I have the DVD placed in the driver.\n\n*When I go to my system details on Ubuntu, I see this:\n\n\n*After having no hope at all and realizing that I had this problem because of partitioning, I went to Installation again. I thought If I had a good partition scheme, it would work. So I found a scheme and applied it on drivers. This time I hit the Install Now again, it asks me where I am from and which language I speak, showing a map of the world. So I see, it works, so I cancel installation before even starting it again. \n\n*Having tried everything I could try (possibly I made it worse trying to fix it myself because of my curiosity) I thought it is best to seek assistance. \n\n*If there is no hope left for me to save information from my HDD, I will just have to install Ubuntu and forget about Windows. \n\n\nSorry for giving you so many details. Probably, 50% of the information I gave you were either pointless or not needed. I tried to be clear as much as I can. Even though I tried my best, I know it is still confusing and you will be asking tons of questions as you try to realize the process. Well, please ask. I just want to save my information from my HDD. I don't really care about Windows.\n\nA: Just a thougt, Im not an expert but have you tried a live boot and going into the file manager to see if you can access your files from there\nEDIT: Just boot from a live CD and then hit try Ubuntu, from there you can try to open the file manager just as you would a normal installation and try to access your windows files. It may not give you permission though.\n\nA: I think the problem rises due to grub error. When you install Ubuntu along side windows ,there cause some errors in boot loader.

Coming from the Microsoft world, where Visual Studio, Windows, and IIS seemingly play nice together, I can attach the Visual Studio debugger to the IIS process and debug code in play.  When a web service call is made to the IIS server, I can evaluate the parameters, and watch the code execute.\nCan I do the same with PHP scripts running in Apache on Ubuntu?  I have PHP5 on Apache2 and have installed xdebug.  PHPINFO() seems to think this is all setup and ready, only I have no idea how to attach this debugger to the httpd process and/or which editor/IDE to use to view the debugging.\n\nA: You can use a browser plugin for Firefox called firePHP to debug php along with editing it \"in play\".

I live in Japan: a country where Dell does not sell the XPS13 Developer Edition.\nAnd I used to work in London where one of my friend had the XPS 13 Dev Edition. And, of course, I really liked it.\nI was wondering if I can just buy a normal xps 13 and install Ubuntu on my own? \nWould there be any extra steps or peculiarities compared to a normal PC install? I would really like to make sure before I invest money and time in this (I do not want to be stuck with a window entertainment laptop since I already have my wife's macbook).\n\nA: I looked over the hardware and it looks like they are exactly the same. Most of the hardware is intel which makes getting your drivers working a non-issue. If you get a Windows 8.1 based laptop you will have to work around getting UEFI Firmware Settings to allow you to install another operating. You Can normally find this setting to disable UEFI in the bios and install like normal. Since this laptop doesn't have a disc drive you will have to use a usb drive to install ubuntu. It looks like the ubuntu version is cheaper from what dells site shows. I Think you could even do the reverse and install windows later if you wanted since the hardware matches.\n\nA: I bought the windows version, wanting to install linux (what I did). It was the most horrible linux install I ever did. The computer reverts into awefull blinking and uncontrollable touchpad every few days. Battery life is 3-4 hours with dimmed screen. \nAt one point I wanted to return it and order a mac instead... this has never happened to me (a die-hard linux fan) before.

I accidentally removed the Ubuntu Software Centre, when I was actually trying to remove my Ubuntu One applications. Although I don't remember directly uninstalling the Centre, I think deleting one of those packages might have triggered it.\nI cannot look at history of application changes, as the Software Centre is missing.\nPlease advise on how to install, or rather reinstall, Ubuntu Software Centre on my computer.\n\nA: Since you are not sure what you deleted, I suggest you to run sudo apt-get purge software-center to clear all files it left over. Then, you can reinstall from scratch by running sudo apt-get install software-center.\nRegarding the history of changes, there is a log file called .bash_history in your home folder which show the history of the commands you run in the terminal.

I had the symptoms characterized by this bug. After setting the BIOS to graphics card: integrated and Optimus: disabled, I was able to start Ubuntu, but it would not detect my external monitor. Then I uninstalled and re-installed Nvidia Primus. Then I tried both suggestions in the bug tracker, involving:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-drivers-common=1:0.2.91.4\n\nand \nsudo dpkg -i ubuntu-drivers-common_0.2.91.5_amd64.deb nvidia-common_0.2.91.5_amd64.deb \n\n(after downloading the associated .deb's), rebooted, and reset the BIOS to graphics card: Optimus and Optimus: enabled, but I cannot detect the external monitor. Am I missing something, or are there any suggestions on how to proceed?\nI am running Ubuntu 14.04 on a Lenovo W520.\nUPDATE\nNow that a fix has been released on ubuntu-drivers-common, any suggestions on how to proceed? I am a bit skeptical because not all of the packages have been fixed, and the Trusty description under ubuntu-drivers-common says Triaged. Is it okay to remove the hold from the packages described below, and is there anything else I should do? \nA little explanation about the meaning of the bug's status would also be helpful. My interpretation is that a fix has been released for ubuntu-drivers-common, and it is a workaround for the moment, because none of the other packages are fixed. Is that correct?\n\nA: I'm the OP of the askubuntu question linked in the bug.\nIt's hard to tell how I got it to work, but my recommendation would be:\nsudo dpkg -i ubuntu-drivers-common_0.2.91.5_amd64.deb nvidia-common_0.2.91.5_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-mark hold ubuntu-drivers-common\nsudo apt-mark hold nvidia-common\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia* bumblebee*\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331-updates nvidia-settings nvidia-prime\n\nIn other words, after the downgrade just reinstall the nvidia driver completely. Of course, feel free to replace nvidia-331-updates with the version of your choice. For me, this seems to have worked and my external screen is working as well.\nEdit: Just now saw your comment that you resolved the issue. Please post that explanation in the bug report as well as it may provide useful information.\nEdit #2: Glad to see that your solution is what I had suggested as well. I guess we can say this has proven to be a working workaround to downgrade.\n\nA: First, check that your drivers are up to date running sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade. If this does not help, you can manually test the drivers in System settings -> Additional drivers. There, you should see a list of video drivers, both open source and closed source. Try with them to see which one works. Sometimes the closed source one is better or more stable. At least that is the case for me with a fairly new ATI card. \nIf none of these drivers solve your issue, then it might be an indication of a bug, in which case your right forum is Launchpad. You can post here any advance done there as this will make this question useful for other users too.\n\nA: Using information from the LaunchPad link above and this link on installing/re-installing Nvidia Primus, I was able to re-implement my external monitors. This answer is not a permanent solution, but rather a detailing of the workaround that was suggested in the LaunchPad issue. \nBasically, I did the following:\nPurged existing Nvidia drivers/Optimus-related packages:\nsudo apt-get purge libvdpau-va-gl1 bumblebee* nvidia*\n\nRe-installed the same:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331 nvidia-settings nvidia-prime\n\nDownloaded and installed the temporary (workaround) downgraded packages:\nsudo dpkg -i ubuntu-drivers-common_0.2.91.5_amd64.deb nvidia-common_0.2.91.5_amd64.deb \n\nRebooted, set my BIOS to graphics card: Optimus and Optimus: enabled, and everything was back to normal. I was able to detect my external monitor. Note that I still cannot use my laptop monitor and my external monitor together since switching from Bumblebee to Primus, but at least I have access to my external monitor again.\n", "Q: What is the \"quality\" of a Wi-Fi access point? In Debian (including Ubuntu) you can use iwlist to scan nearby Wi-Fi access points.

I can understand what \"signal level\" means, it is RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication). However, what does \"quality\" mean really? How is it measured?\nMeanwhile, on my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS laptop, it is weird because the \"signal level\" fields of all scanned access points are 0, so are the \"noise level\" fields. But on my Raspberry Pi which has Raspbian, I can see \"quality\", \"signal level\", and \"noise level\" fields have different readings. (This is not the primary problem, but if you know the answer please just breifly describe a little bit.)\n\nA: According to the documentation for Wireless Extensions, the information provided to Wireless Tools comes from /proc/net/wireless, which are more clearly defined by:\n\nThe basic difference between Quality - link and Quality - level is that the first indicate how good the reception is (for example the percentage of correctly received packets) and the second how strong the signal is. The Quality - level is some directly measurable data that is likely to have the same signification across devices.\n\nIt appears that the Quality - link value is the one that other tools tend to reference most.\nIt should also be pointed out that /proc/net/wireless is apparently a clone of /proc/net/dev which provides a different output, but you could in theory calculate the difference. \nLooking at the source briefly, it appears these values come from the driver. That could explain your problem with the Quality - level and Quality - noise values: your driver doesn't support Wireless Extensions, or doesn't support it well.\n", "Q: Simulate power button using command?

How is it possible to pause the playback of VLC when my headphones are plugged out?\nI can mute the speakers via ALSA, but I want to use the plug trigger to stop the playback, as it is usual in smartphones.\n\nA: Ok, so you will need to do a few things for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Detect when the headphones are unplugged;\n\n*After the event in (1), send a \"pause\" command to VLC;\n\n*Detect when the headphones are pluggd back in;\n\n*After the event in (3), send a \"play\" command to VLC;\n\n\nFor (1) and (3):\nYou can use what is shown here.\nThis answer contains a small procedure to find the difference between a plugged and unplugged jack, and a script that you can modify to conform to your case.\nFor (2) and (4):\nYou should use VLC's Dbus interface.\nThe relevant code should be this:\ndbus-send --print-reply --session --dest=org.mpris.vlc /Player org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer.Pause\ndbus-send --print-reply --session --dest=org.mpris.vlc /Player org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer.Play\nFor pause and play respectively.\nNow, about the script. In your case, it should look something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n# This scripts detecs unplugging headphones.\n\noldstatus=\"unrelated string\"\nwhile [ 1 ]; do\n    # The following line has to be changed depending on the difference (use diff) in '/proc/asound/card0/code#0'\n    status=$(grep -A 4 'Node 0x16' '/proc/asound/card0/codec#0' |  grep 'Amp-Out vals:  \\[0x80 0x80\\]')\n    if [ \"$status\" != \"$oldstatus\" ]; then\n        if [ -n \"$status\" ]; then\n            echo \"Plugged in\"\n             dbus-send --print-reply --session --dest=org.mpris.vlc /Player org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer.Play\n            oldstatus=\"$status\"\n        else\n            echo \"Unplugged\"\n            dbus-send --print-reply --session --dest=org.mpris.vlc /Player org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer.Pause\n            oldstatus=\"$status\"\n        fi\n    fi\n    # Now sleep for 250 milli-seconds as per @Serg's request (who learnt if from @Fabby)\n    # sleep is timer-based so doesn't use *any* processor cycles while sleeping.\n    sleep 0.25\ndone\n\nAdd this modified script to your startup applications, and you're set. I think it should do what you wanted to.\nPS - Note that there are more efficient ways to do this, such as using inotify to detect event changes (and maybe even other approaches), but this one should get you started (and the others are above my skill level and experience). I suppose you can start with this \"hackish\" approach, and build up from here.\n\nA: Ok, so based on what I have learned from here, I am trying a new approach, using ACPI.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a script, for pausing and unpausing VLC:\nsudo touch /etc/acpi/headphone_jack.sh\nsudo chmod +x /etc/acpi/headphone_jack.sh\n\nand place the following on this file:\n_pid=`pgrep vlc`\n_pid=\"${_pid% *}\"\nDBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=`grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/$_pid/environ | sed -e 's/DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=//'`\n_username=`grep -z USER= /proc/$_pid/environ |sed 's/.*=//'`\n\nif [ \"$3\" = unplug ]; then\n    su $_username -c \"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS dbus-send --print-reply --session --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.vlc /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.Pause\"\nelse\n    su $_username -c \"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS dbus-send --print-reply --session --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.vlc /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.Play\"\nfi\n\n\n*Now let's create an event trigger (replace vim with your favourite text editor):\nsudo vim /etc/acpi/events/headphones\n\nand add the following:\nevent=jack/headphone\naction=/etc/acpi/headphone_jack.sh %e\n\n\n*Finally, restart the ACPI daemon:\nsudo service acpid restart\n\nI think the should be exactly what you require, with no polling involved.\nThe only drawback I can find with this implementation is in case you have multiple users running VLC at the same time. I suppose in that case, what can happen is that this approach will randomly pause and resume one of them (or it might simply not work).\nBig Kudos to @int_ua and @Sneetsher for providing me with important knowledge regarding ACPI event handling. Also thumbs up to @user3073656 for helping simplify the procedure.\n", "Q: password recovery while os is running When I start my PC , then ubuntu is not asking for password.

It happened with me too, in my case, I knew package that I just removed, re-installing it worked for me. \nSo  you've removed a package on which lot of packages were dependent.\nIt's like when you install a package-A, which has dependency on package-B, both are installed and when you try to remove package-A, package-B is removed automatically .\n\nIn your case, by looking at dependencies, it might be a package that was installed when you installed the system. \n\n\n*\n\n*Use history command to see your terminal history and look after recently important package.\n\n*less /var/log/apt/history.log will help you look in your apt-get history list the package you're removed, re-install them.\nLet me know, if you need any more help in it.\n\nA: Another reason may be that the Ubuntu mirror has stopped being updated.

From the terminal type:\nsudo apt install cuetools shntool flac\n\nTo split a flac file back to the original files using a .cue file:\ncuebreakpoints '<cue file>' | shnsplit -o flac '<audio flac file>'  \n\nYou can drag the cue file and the audio flac file from the file manager into the terminal in order to autocomplete the paths for '<cue file>' and '<audio flac file>'. When you run the command, the terminal will show you the results of each new flac file as it is created, one new flac file at a time (\"split-track01.flac\" \"split-track02.flac\" ...), and then stop after all of the new flac files have been created. It only takes a few seconds to create each new flac file. If your .cue file is accurate, the results will be more accurate and less time-consuming than if you split the flac file manually in Audacity.\n\nA: The easiest way is using K3B.\n1.- Open the CUE file in K3B. \n2.- Choose convert tracks to FLAC. \n3.- Press Start. \nIt will not re-convert the tracks but only split them into tracks according to the CUE file. \nIt will keep the original name of each track and it takes second to complete the \"convertion/split\".\n\nA: and for flac:\n    cat file.cue | shnsplit -o flac -t %n-%t file.flac\n\nsplit the flac file and add to the resulting files track number (%n) and title name (%t)\n\nA: Here is a PHP script:\n<?php\n$s_cue = $argv[1];\n$a_cue = file($s_cue);\n$n_row = -1;\nforeach ($a_cue as $s_row) {\n   $s_trim = trim($s_row);\n   $a_row = str_getcsv($s_trim, ' ');\n   if (preg_match('/^FILE\\s/', $s_row) == 1) {\n      $s_file = $a_row[1];\n   }\n   if (preg_match('/^\\s+TRACK\\s/', $s_row) == 1) {\n      $n_row++;\n      $a_table[$n_row]['track'] = $a_row[1];\n   }\n   if (preg_match('/^\\s+TITLE\\s/', $s_row) == 1) {\n      $a_table[$n_row]['title'] = $a_row[1];\n   }\n   if (preg_match('/^\\s+PERFORMER\\s/', $s_row) == 1) {\n      $a_table[$n_row]['artist'] = $a_row[1];\n   }\n   if (preg_match('/^\\s+INDEX\\s/', $s_row) == 1) {\n      $s_dur = $a_row[2];\n      $a_frame = sscanf($s_dur, '%d:%d:%d', $n_min, $n_sec, $n_fra);\n      $n_index = $n_min * 60 + $n_sec + $n_fra / 75;\n      $a_table[$n_row]['ss'] = $n_index;\n      if ($n_row > 0) {\n         $a_table[$n_row - 1]['to'] = $n_index;\n      }\n   }\n}\n$a_table[$n_row]['to'] = 10 * 60 * 60;\nforeach ($a_table as $m_row) {\n   $a_cmd = [\n      'ffmpeg',\n      '-i', $s_file,\n      '-ss', $m_row['ss'],\n      '-to', $m_row['to'],\n      '-metadata', 'artist=' . $m_row['artist'],\n      '-metadata', 'title=' . $m_row['title'],\n      '-metadata', 'track=' . $m_row['track'],\n      $m_row['track'] .

I've spent a load of time researching and haven't found a good answer so I'm asking here.\nBasic Problem: I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my HP Pavilion 14 Sleekbook to dual boot along side windows. I had tried this a year earlier (actually it was 12.04) and got it working (I think I used easyBCD but honestly can't remember) but at some point Ubuntu stopped booting and I was too busy to mess with it. I followed instructions for getting rid of ubuntu and it seemed to work but whenever I turned on my machine the windows boot loader would offer me Ubuntu or Windows. I ignored it and went about my business.\nSo the other day with some time on my hands, I decided to install Ubuntu 14.04 from a USB. Everything seem to go fine, but when I couldn't boot into Ubuntu. Thinking I could fix any issues associated with the last go around I used the reset function on EasyBCD and afterwards created (I thought!) a new slot for Windows, figuring I would make sure that works before moving onto Ubuntu. Well, it didn't. When I reset the computer it immediately goes to a blank screen with an occasional flicker in the beginning. Windows won't boot. Eventually I figured out that if I press f10 in the very start it gives me the option of loading Windows 8 or configuration. If I hit windows 8 it goes back to the blank screen. If I hit esc it gives me a list of boot options which include Ubuntu and my USB, but not Windows. I can also access the BIOS and boot options. \nUbuntu seems to boot fine and I am happily using it, but I would really like to get my Windows boot back and the files stuck on that partition. I ran boot-repair in Ubuntu and there are no changes to behavior. Here is the URL http://paste.ubuntu.com/8284130 from boot-repair.\nI should also note that Windows came pre-installed and there was no System Restore disc (there is also no DVD drive).

I have attempted to re-do the GRUB and Bootloader, and manually mount the drives. This is noted below\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda \n\n*free space : mb\n\n*/dev/sda1 efi 536mb (free) 33mb (used)\n\n*/dev/sda2 ext4 741638mb (free) 15800mb(used) Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\n\n*/dev/sda3 swap 7978 mb (free) \n\n*free space\n\n\nMy attempt to boot repair\nI have tried installing Ubuntu on multiple attempts. I have installed via USB and wiped Windows completely. I have then also tried the option of 'Try Ubuntu without installing' and then installing. On both methods, the Ubuntu installer has recognized the previous install, and I have overwritten it. Once all has installed, it prompts for a reboot..where it gets the above error message. Just to clarify- I have not been able to boot directly to Ubuntu, and there is currently no OS other than Ubuntu 14.04 on this laptop. \nThe first instance, I installed a Grub repair program and went with that. The guide in which I followed is hosted on the Community. You can view this here. As per the instructions, the first command(s) I ran were as follows: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nThis went through the terminal with no issue. Once it completed, it recommended I run the following commands: \nsudo chroot \"/mnt/boot-sav/sda2\" dpkg --configure -a\nsudo chroot \"/mnt/boot-sav/sda2\" apt-get install -fy\nsudo chroot \"/mnt/boot-sav/sda2\" apt-get purge -y --force-yes grub* shim-signed linux-signed*\n\nUpon completion, I rebooted and all was the same- no luck!\nRepair Grub2\nSo with the above not working, I tried the next guide. Now, this one I was not so sure on. Because I had booted from the USB, I decided to add an admin account for myself- what was the harm? I was not too certain on this one, so point out any mistakes please!\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt\n\nThere were no errors, prompts etc. so I assume when you mount there is no confirmation etc. I then ran the following commands:\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev &&\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts &&\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc &&\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nOnce again, nothing happened- which is what I expected. I then ran the next command: \nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nNow that I was done, I went with the next command of: \ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\nThis is where I ran into the following errors: \nE: Failed to fetch http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/grub/grub_0.97-29ubuntu66_amd64.deb  Could not resolve 'au.archive.ubuntu.com'\n\nE: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?\n\nI am not sure if an error of the file no longer exists, or is outdated etc. In this instance I did what any idiot does.

This was fun..\nsudo lshw -c disk\n\nThe logical name of my drive is/dev/sda. Awesome, now I follow this up. \nUnfortunately I could not find the disk utility (Yo, askubuntu- 10 points for n00b). I went into the next available option...the terminal! I start fdisk with the following:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\nThen enter 'm' for menu, 'n' for new and followed the details. The new partition was made, so then I formatted with:\nsudo mkfs -t ext3 /dec/sdb1\n\nI read, then re-read the guide and no luck..no boot device. Frustrated, I tried check disk for defects. Apparently all good. I am greatly exceeded my knowledge of Ubuntu/Linux.\nUpdates\nI have now tried to install Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Lubuntu and Debian- also using different Live USB creators. All has resulted in the same. I  have/am purchasing a small SSD and 16GB Ram- we will see if a different hard drive helps the situation. \nI gathered as much, as I believe it is an issue with UEFI/Safe Boot and is on the motherboard. \n\nA: From the error message it looks like your system is trying to boot from a media device such as CD or USB (probably the one you used for installation).\nThus try to go in the BIOS of you computer and change the boot device priority, selecting the drive where linux is installed. If this does not work (or you did it already) then fall back to other installation issues.\n\nA: My solution is based on an answer posted on the question \"Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (EUFI Supported).\" So, I did as follows:\n1- I made a parition on my SSD using the default Window's Disk Management Tool\n2- I then grabbed the latest version of Rufus and made a bootable EUFI & Safeboot USB with Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS. \n3- I then enabled Secure Boot in my Bios (after performing the CMD command as per the answer on the other question), and continued installing Ubuntu. \nNote: I selected Something Else, and manually made my Root 80GB, Swap 5GB and EFI 5GB Now pay attention, this is something I did without reading the guide (although it may be in there..)\nAfter installing the Ubuntu system, I was booting straigh to Window's 8. I followed these steps:\n4- I then booted into the Advanced Options (Shift + Restart) and went Advanced Options > Window's Startup Settings > Elected my Ubuntu Boot. Viola! It worked, went straigh to my Ubuntu install with no issues.\nFor piece of mind, I then used GParted to format my Window's Partition and did a grub repair. Finally, I am now a happy Linux user. Whilst I was unable to boot before to Linux directly, using Dual Boot afforded me the option of electing my boot. \nI know this has worked for me, however I cannot confirm if it will work for others. \n", "Q: two ubuntu 14.04 operating systems along with windows 7 i have some really serious issue with my laptop.  this is regarding the Ubuntu 14.04 operation system. Presently,i have installed two ubuntu 14.04 's along side windows 7.\nso , please can anyone tell me how to delete/remove one of the ubuntu 14.04??\n\nA: If you have a single hard-disk with an extra Ubuntu installation, just boot from the one you want to keep, install gparted (sudo apt-get gparted). In gparted remove the unwanted partition and decide what to do with the empty space. Then, BEFORE REBOOTING type sudo apt-get install /dev/sda assuming /dev/sda is your hard disk. Reboot and you're done.\n", "Q: How can I disable alt+click window dragging? In Ubuntu 14.04, when you hold Alt and click a window, you can drag it around.  As I understand, you used to be able to disable it through gconf, but Unity doesn't read settings from here any more (hence not being able to change where the window buttons are any more).\nThere's no setting for this by default, and I can't find anything in Unity Tweak Tool either.  Is there anyway to disable Alt+click window movement in 14.04?\n\nA: You can us CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM).  This tool is essential if you want to tweak Linux for better efficiency, because it makes it easy to configure the desktop environment to be much more efficient then out-of-the-box Ubuntu.  I used to use things like dconf-editor, and Ubuntu Tweak, but for tweaking anything related to desktop behavior, I have found CCSM to be much more powerful and easy to use.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install CompizConfig Settings Manager by typing this in a terminal:\nsudo apt install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins compiz-plugins-extra\n\n\n*Open CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager), go to the Window Management section, and find the Move Windows icon.  \n\n*Make sure Move Window is enabled, and then Click it's button.\n\n\n\n*Click the button to the right of the Initiate Move Window with the mouse icon next to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n*In the Edit Initiate Window Move window, and then make sure to un-check the Enabled check-box.  That will disable it.  You can also easily set the Window Move to a different mouse/keyboard/screen-edge combination, if you would like, although binding it to a screen edge wouldn't work.  This is where this tool, CCSM, outdoes dconf-editor and Ubuntu Tweak.\n\n\n\n\nA: In 14.04 (or 14.10, 15.04, 15.10, 16.04), to set the default key / value:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/mouse-button-modifier  '\"<Alt>\"'\n\nYou can give it a (limited number of) other value(s), but DON'T set it to none like you could in the past. Nor should you set it to an empty string,  Doing either will give you some trouble getting control over your mouse back, as I found out...\nThe practical value of this information is quite limited, since not many alternative keys are accepted. I found only Shift and Super to be working, which I doubt will give you the solution you'd like to have.\nOf course you can use dconf-editor as well:\norg>gnome>desktop>wm>preferences\n\n\n\nA: You can also use GNOME Tweak Tool (gnome-tweak-tool).\nIn 'Windows' section, change the 'Window Action Key' setting.\nThis tool is obviously for the GNOME Shell tweaking, but some properties are respected by Unity as well. \n\nA: If you are using KDE Plasma then you can use System Settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for System Settings in the Application Launcher or run systemsettings\n\n*Click Window Management under the Workspace section\n\n*On the left select Window Behavior and go to the third tab labeled Window Actions.\n\n*The second section is labeled Inner Window, Titlebar & Frame. You can change any of these drop-down menus to 'Nothing' to disable their action.\n\n\n\n\nA: Today I've learned that pressing key\n\nSuper\n\ntogether with\n\nAlt + Click\n\ncircumvents (deactivates) the dragging behavior. Solved my issues at least, as the application (Inkscape) I wanted to use Alt+Click with, seems to simply ignore the additional key (Super) been pressed.\nsf. https://askubuntu.com/a/445254/618422\n#edit\nBy the way, it's also documented officially at:\nhttps://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/basic/tutorial-basic.en.html#Selecting_under_and_dragging_selected\nhttps://inkscape.org/doc/tutorials/basic/tutorial-basic.html\n\nA: I was trying to use dconf-editor but the setting didn't work. A little obvious, but if you are using cinnamon instead of GNOME then you should edit:\norg > cinnamon > desktop > wm > preferences\n\n\nA: You can also do this through Compiz Settings Manager.\nJust install it with sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager.\nThe addon is called 'Move' and is located in section called 'Window Management' I believe.\nYou can go straight to its settings with ccsm -p move.\nI really recommend this application. It gives access to massive amount of system customization options.\n\nA: If you're on KDE (Kubuntu), you go to:\nSettings → Window Management → Window Behaviour → Window Actions → * \n\nThen Change the Modifier Key to Meta or change the Left click to something else.\n", "Q: How set the correct hour in Ubuntu Server?

But in the middle, it just stop downloading but still responsive but doesn't make any progress. \nsince I can't find solution on the Internet I close it, and now it wants to uninstall the previous installation progress \nIs there a way to resume what I already download?\nor can I download Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in torrent and link it in wubi?\n\nA: I had the same problem and got a great answer. You can download the iso file with a torrent client or your browser or a download manager. Then do your own MD5/SHA-1 check using Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier. Put the iso file in the same directory as wubi.exe and it will use that instead of trying to download. Unfortunately there is another bug that prevents it from successfully checking the MD5 sum. So you have to open a Windows command prompt and type wubi --skipmd5check. \nFor me that got the install to go, however I personally ran into what I think is another bug. The install says (on both of two attempts) that \"Serious errors were found while checking the disk drive for /\".  There is forum discussion on this and even a youtube video on how to fix it and says that \"This happens when you use the Wubi installation method with Ubuntu 14\".\n\nA: Wubi is no longer an option of installing Ubuntu. Anything after WinXP is going to create issues for you. It is much better to boot from USB Drive or create a bootable DVD. Download the actual Ubuntu Software from the home website (Ubuntu.com/desktop (avoid WUBI)). If you have done either of these 2, just reboot and hit F12, change the boot order to USB or DVD and off you go. Much simpler to just install it yourself.\n\nA: Just Get A USB (2GB minimum), Download the ubuntu iso image \n For Direct Download use http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\n For The Torrent Download Visit http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads scroll down and you will see the torrent links\n Use UnetBootin to install the iso image you downloaded into the usb drive \n Restart your computer select boot from usb from the BIOS Menu it should boot from the usb drive.

As an alternative, you could move your existing FAT32 partition towards the end of the drive to allow for installation of live USB images to the beginning of the flash drive.\nFirst, shrink your existing FAT32 partition down far enough to ensure that there is enough free space for the live OS image, then use a partition manager to move this partition towards the end of the partition table until there is enough free space at the beginning to do your live OS installation.\nYou could use a program like Gparted to accomplish this quite easily.\nsudo apt-get -y install gparted\nsudo gparted\n\nAlternatively, you can backup your files from the USB flash drive, format the entire flash drive as FAT32, install the live USB image onto the flash drive via unetbootin, then create a folder at the root of your USB drive called \"my files\" or whatever you'd like, then store your files in there.\nNote: I know this to work for Ubuntu Live USBs, but I cannot guarantee that it will work for non-debian distributions. For instance, Fedora Live USB does not work correctly when created from unetbootin.\nInstalling unetbootin:\nsudo apt-get -y install unetbootin\n\n", "Q: How can I repeat the content of a file n times? I'm trying to benchmark to compare two different ways of processing a file. I have a small amount of input data but in order to get good comparisons, I need to repeat the tests a number of times.\nRather than just repeating the tests I would like to duplicate the input data a number of times (eg 1000) so a 3 line file becomes 3000 lines and I can run a much more fulfilling test.\nI'm passing the input data in via a filename:\nmycommand input-data.txt\n\n\nA: I would just use a text editor.\nvi input-data.txt\ngg (move cursor to the beginning of the file)\nyG (yank til the end of the file)\nG (move the cursor to the last line of the file)\n999p (paste the yanked text 999 times)\n:wq (save the file and exit)\n\nIf you absolutely need to do it via the command-line (this requires you to have vim installed, as vi doesn't have the :normal command), you could use:\nvim -es -u NONE \"+normal ggyGG999p\" +wq input-data.txt\n\nHere, -es (or -e -s) makes vim operate silently, so it shouldn't take over your terminal window, and -u NONE stops it from looking at your vimrc, which should make it run a little faster than it otherwise would (maybe much faster, if you use a lot of vim plugins).\n\nA: Here's an awk solution:\nawk '{a[NR]=$0}END{for (i=0; i<1000; i++){for(k in a){print a[k]}}}' file \n\nIt's essentially as fast as @Gnuc's Perl (I ran both 1000 times and got the average time):\n$ for i in {1..1000}; do \n (time awk '{a[NR]=$0}END{for (i=0;i<1000;i++){for(k in a){print a[k]}}}' file > a) 2>&1 | \n    grep -oP 'real.*?m\\K[\\d\\.]+'; done | awk '{k+=$1}END{print k/1000}'; \n0.00426\n\n$ for i in {1..1000}; do \n  (time perl -0777pe '$_=$_ x 1000' file > a ) 2>&1 | \n    grep -oP 'real.*?m\\K[\\d\\.]+'; done | awk '{k+=$1}END{print k/1000}'; \n0.004076\n\n\nA: Here is a simple one-liner, no scripting involved:\nmycommand <(cat `yes input-data.txt | head -1000 | paste -s`)\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*`yes input-data.txt | head -1000 | paste -s` produces the text input-data.txt 1000 times seperated by white space\n\n*The text is then passed to cat as a files list\n\n\nA: You don't need input-duplicated.txt.\nTry:\nmycommand <(perl -0777pe '$_=$_ x 1000' input-data.txt)\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*0777 : -0 sets sets the input record separator (perl special variable $/ which is a newline by default). Setting this to a value greater than 0400 will cause Perl to slurp the entire input file into memory. \n\n*pe : the -p means \"print each input line after applying the script given by -e to it\". \n\n*$_=$_ x 1000 : $_ is the current input line. Since we're reading the entire file at once because of -0700, this means the entire file. The x 1000 will result in 1000 copies of the entire file being printed. \n\n\nA: While working on a completely different script , I've learned that with 29 million lines of text, using seek() and operating on data bytewise is often faster than on line-by-line basis. Same idea is applied in the script below: we open file, and instead of looping through opening and closing the file (which may add overhead, even if not significant), we keep the file open and seek back to the beginning. \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport sys,os\n\ndef error_out(string):\n    sys.stderr.write(string+\"\\n\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ndef read_bytewise(fp):\n    data = fp.read(1024)\n    print(data.decode(),end=\"\",flush=True)\n    while data:\n        data = fp.read(1024)\n        print(data.decode(),end=\"\",flush=True)\n    #fp.seek(0,1)\n\ndef main():\n    howmany = int(sys.argv[1]) + 1\n    if not os.path.isfile(sys.argv[2]):\n       error_out(\"Needs a valid file\") \n\n    fp = open(sys.argv[2],'rb')\n    for i in range(1,howmany):\n        #print(i)\n        fp.seek(0)\n        read_bytewise(fp)\n    fp.close()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__': main()\n\nThe script itself is quite simple in usage:\n./repeat_text.py <INT> <TEXT.txt>\n\nFor 3 line text file and 1000 iteration it goes quite alright, about 0.1 seconds:\n$ /usr/bin/time ./repeat_text.py 1000 input.txt  > /dev/null                                                             \n0.10user 0.00system 0:00.23elapsed 45%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 9172maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+1033minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n\nThe script itself isn't most elegant, probably could be shortened, but does the job. Of course, I added a few extra bits here and there, like error_out() function, which isn't necessary - it's just a small user-friendly touch. \n\nA: I was originally thinking that I would have to generate a secondary file but I could just loop the original file in Bash and use some redirection to make it appear as a file.\nThere are probably a dozen different ways of doing the loop but here are four:\nmycommand <( seq 1000 | xargs -i -- cat input-data.txt )\nmycommand <( for _ in {1..1000}; do cat input-data.txt; done )\nmycommand <((for _ in {1..1000}; do echo input-data.txt; done) | xargs cat )\nmycommand <(awk '{for(i=0; i<1000; i++)print}' input-data.txt)  #*\n\nThe third method there is improvised from maru's comment below and builds a big list of input filenames for cat. xargs will split this into as many arguments as the system will allow. It's much faster than n separate cats.\nThe awk way (inspired by terdon's answer) is probably the most optimised but it duplicates each line at a time. This may or may not suit a particular application, but it's lightning fast and efficient.\n\nBut this is generating on the fly. Bash outputting is likely to be very much more slow than something can read so you should generate a new file for testing. Thankfully that's only a very simple extension:\n(for _ in {1..1000}; do echo input-data.txt; done) | xargs cat > input-duplicated.txt\nmycommand input-duplicated.txt\n\n\nA: We can solve this without an additional file, nor special programs, pure Bash (well, cat is an standard command).\nBased on a feature of printf inside bash we can generate a repeated string):\nprintf \"test.file.txt %.0s\\n\" {1..1000}\n\nThen, we can send such list of 1000 filenames (repeated) and call cat:\nprintf \"test.file.txt %.0s\" {1..1000} | xargs cat \n\nAnd finally, we can give the output to the command to execute:\nmycommand \"$( printf \"%.0sinput.txt\\n\" {1..1000} | xargs cat )\"\n\nOr, if the command needs to receive the input in the stdin:\nmycommand < <( printf \"%.0sinput.txt\\n\" {1..1000} | xargs cat )\n\nYes, the double < is needed.\n\nA: I would generate a new file using Unix for loop:\ncontent=$(cat Alex.pgn); for i in {1..900000}; do echo \"$content\" >> new_file; done \n\n", "Q: oh my zsh for the root and for all user I have installed zsh and I am using Oh My ZSH plugins.

Will the system boot if I upgrade to 14.04?\n\nA: In general the upgrade system will work but if we all say \"yes\" to your question and the system does not what then?! Maybe it can be fixed, maybe not. But at that moment you have a problem that might need a format or a rebuild of your system. Who knows.  \nYour problem has a very simple solution: make a backup and make sure you know how to and that you can restore that backup. \n", "Q: How do I connect two remote servers I've been working with LANs using Ubuntu for some time now. So I have 2 office locations, each with their own Ubuntu servers. Now we need to link them and we have been provided with a leased line. In summary,\n\n\n*\n\n*Each server works fine within their LAN\n\n*Each network has its own Internet connection (not relevant I think)\n\n*Each LAN can ping the remote router. i.e., Office A allows to ping router A and vice versa.\n\n\nBut I cannot go beyond the router in the remote office. For example, from offcie A, I can ping the router of office B but NOT the server of that office.\nAm I missing something? Please advise what needs to be done.\nEach machine has a static IP.\nThanks!\n\n\nA: The router needs to know to which server it has to forward requests to. You now have one server in each location, but that doesn't matter for the router. So you need to configure port forwarding. In the router you can set which port has to be forwarded to which machine or IP address. That machine has to accept that traffic, so you may need to configure the firewall of the server. \n\nA: There are many possibilities how you could set this up, none of which are trivial.  Among others, you could\n\n\n*\n\n*setup a site-to-site VPN\n\n*setup NAT\n\n\nVPNs have the advantage of providing encrypted communication channels, which is highly recommended these days. They are somewhat difficult to setup for a rookie, but once in place, they work transparently.\nNAT is a bit easier to configure, but wouldn't secure the communication (ie. if the protocol is unencrypted then the network data may be read by the telcos).\nIn any case, you need to know \n\n\n*\n\n*about networking\n\n*how to operate the routers given to you by the telco\n\n*the link is going to be used (VoIP, HTTP, SMB, ...?)\n\n", "Q: Need a server to monitor the outflow of request I am trying to open a small office, with the machine support of five.

Kindly note that I cannot have an extravagant expenditure as the financial resources are limited. An early reply would be very helpful.\n\nA: You could use squid proxy server. Configure your gateway router to route all outbound traffic from your office through the squid proxy server.\nThis would afford you the following advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*caching of web pages\n\n*fine control of what websites and external ip addresses can or cannot be connected to\n\n*optional whitelist or blacklist models for allowing access to external web sites / ip addresses\n\n*configurable level of logging for what traffic is passing through the proxy server\n\n\nHere is a link to the squid wiki to get you started:\nConfigExamples - Squid Web Proxy Wiki\nEdit - response to question about using this on Ubuntu Server:\nHere is a link to Ubuntu Server Guide -\nUbuntu 14.04 Server Guide PDF\nI highly recommend that you download and keep handy this great pdf.

I am trying to fix a performance issue bug on one of the core apps, and I would like to know if there is any benchmarking or monitoring tool that I can use to compare my different branches use of CPU.\nThanks.\n\nA: Since you talked about \"core apps\", I suppose you are referring to Ubuntu Touch Core Apps project.\nIn that case (Ubuntu SDK/QML development) there are two tools that you could find useful for your purpose:\n\n\n*\n\n*PerformanceOverlay from Ubuntu.PerformanceMetrics module.\nAccording to documentation:\n\nPerformanceOverlay\n\nOverlay displaying performance related metrics (rendering time, CPU usage, etc.) \nPerformanceOverlay displays various performance related indicators to help developers detect issues in their application.\n\n\n\n*Simply use top or htop from terminal, to spot CPU usage for each thread used by your QML application.\nThe tools I listed above are especially good to check out issue related to QML Animation usage.\nIf you need to track the time required by a JS/QML function to be run, you can use Console.time() and Console.timeEnd() method.\nSee http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtquick-debugging.html for further information on Console.time().\n", "Q: Installing desktop in Ubuntu 14.04 server I installed Ubuntu desktop and lubuntu desktop on ubuntu server like this:\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nBut it didn't install basic programs like terminal and I dont see any applets on the topbar when new programs are installed (like teamviewer), I also install virtual box but when I try to run by searching its not there..\nTotally confused.

After doing that you should expect to boot right into Windows without a GRUB prompt.  Since you installed using WUBI that should be all you need to do.  If you had installed Ubuntu to its own partition then you would use the: disk partition tool to reclaim the space after fixing the bootloader.

That doesn't download either!\nMy internet speed is 100Mbps so I guess that's not the issue. I've tried uninstalling and installing again but it doesn't help.\nWhat should I do? Is there a log file that might help diagnose the issue?\n\nA: Ok First thing to do here is to check if your firewall is blocking ktorrent from downloading torrents but i dont think Kubuntu comes with a firewall settings managers so install firehol instead by running sudo apt-get install firehol in the terminal .\n  Also go the preferences in Ktorrent and change your default port to something else (just change the didgits there to something else but with the same amount of digits) . You could also try to enable DHT checkbox in 'BitTorrent' section of the configuration menu.\n\nA: Transmission is the best torrent client for Linux/Ubuntu I have ever tried. You can install Transmission using this code in a terminal window:\n   sudo apt-get install transmission transmission-gtk\n\nAfter you're done with installing the app, you should open Transmission and change a few settings in there from the Preferences menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Torrents tab mark Stop Seeding at ratio and choose value 1.00\n\n*In the Speed tab, mark both Limit upload speed and Limit download speed and change the values in there to at least 1500kib/s for Upload and at least 5000kib/s for Download\n\n*While still in the Speed tab, go to temporary speed limits and choose similar values for both upload and download speed. Eg. 1600 kib/s Upload and 6000 kib/s Download\n\n*In the Privacy tab, mark Use Local Peer Discovery\n\n*In the Network tab, first make sure to test your port for incoming connections by pressing the Test Port button, and if all is ok, you should go to Limits under the same tab for Network and increase value for Peers to 1024 in both fields\nAnd this should be all. Close Transmission, and next time you open it, you should see increased performance for both downloading and uploading your favorite torrents.\nIf you still experience issues while downloading torrent files, try to change your Download folder for torrents, default is ~/home/user/Downloads, to another folder present in your ~/home/user/ directory, for instance make a new folder and name it Torrents or whatever. \nIF, by any chance, you played recently with your \"Accounts and Users\" settings, in Kubuntu general settings, you should make sure that your user account has full administrative privilegies and it is not restricted in any way for network access.\n", "Q: how to install Ubuntu 14.04 on a Dynamic Disk?

After running the update manager until the system is said to be up-to-date, I have two problems: I cannot access USB memory sticks and the laptop hangs during shut-down.\nThe problem might somehow be connected to the update packages \"common library libudev\" and \"/dev/ and hotplug background process\": I selected one update at a time; when selecting \"common library libudev\" as the second last (I wanted to select \"/dev/ and hotplug background process\" as the last one), the update hung at that moment the status bar showed Setting up udev (204-5ubuntu20.5). Some lines before that, it said Adding diversion of /bin/udevadm to /bin/udevadm.upgrade by fake-udev'; that might also be of interest. Other than that it was the usual preparing to unpack, unpacking, processing and setting up \"libudev1:i386 (204-5ubuntu20.5)\".

At that stage, I posted a description in the question https://askubuntu.com/q/521402/288322 (perhaps that description could help, even though I closed that question.)\nThen, I opened the update manager again and it automatically run some tasks and showing the message that the system is now up-to-date. There were no more updates available, i.e. the \"/dev/ and hotplug background process\" which I did not yet choose to install must have been installed automatically. USB and shut-down worked, wireless not. \nThen, after re-starting, this changed: Now, I...\n\n\n*\n\n*...cannot access any USB memory sticks;\n\n*...the system hangs at shut-down showing Killing all remaining processes ...

When using a Lubuntu 14.04.1 live-CD, all devices are directly accessible.\nCould this problem be related to udev? Because between restarting after the failed first update and before re-running the update manager once more, I could access USB devices as well as shut-down the system properly. But, wifi/eth1 was missing. I put the whole syslog on https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b1ghdxsq1x1v7wv/AAD05PcvzIY33SpbcsXoK0QKa?dl=0 in case that might help. I also added kern.log, apt/history.log, apt/term.log, installer/syslog, installer/debug and the output of lspci -nn and demidecode.\nThere was also a comment that the kernel might not mapp correctly to sd*, see USB recognized but not available?.\nThanks for some hints in advance!\nUpdate 1\nBy chance, I found that a USB stick that is already connected before switching on the laptop is accessible. \nNow, lsusb shows:\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8644:800b  \nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\n\nAnd 'fdisk -l`:\nDisk /dev/sda: 80.0 GB, 80026361856 bytes\n255 Köpfe, 63 Sektoren/Spur, 9729 Zylinder, zusammen 156301488 Sektoren\nEinheiten = Sektoren von 1 × 512 = 512 Bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nFestplattenidentifikation: 0x000e9d19\n\n   Gerät  boot.

message is this one:\n/usr/bin/ld: this linker was not configured to use sysroots\n\nThat indicates a mismatch between gcc & ld.\nYou probably need to install an updated version of binutils (being the package that normally contains /usr/bin/ld), to match the version of gcc you're using.\n", "Q: Ubuntu / Windows 7/8 boot issue I installed a dual boot Windows 7/8 on my laptop and now I also added a Ubuntu 14.04.1.\nTo install Ubuntu I did an efi partition on sda1, a swap partition (sda6) and root (sda7)\nAfter the installation Ubuntu was launch by default so I installed GRUB then Boot-Repair, launch the recommended option but I got the following message:\n\nGPT detected. You need to create a BIOS-boot partition .... or try to active the seperate efi boot option ....\n\n\nSo I tried this advanced option and repair again but after all the process I got the following message:\n\nA error occurred during repair, write on paper the following URL ....\n\nAfter rebooting no one of the both windows partitions is visible on GRUB menu.\nThe link of the bootinfo report: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8291284/\nI also tried to manually add a menu entry in the /etc/grub.d/40_custom but when I did something like:\nmenuentry 'Windows 7' {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod ntfs\n    set root='hd0,gpt4'\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nI get a new entry on GRUB but an error if I select it : \"Invalid efi file path\"\nCan't find how to make it works, so if you have any suggestion please let me know\n\nA: Looks like you are successfully booting with UEFI, at least the error message expecting a UEFI binary suggests that.\nThe only thing you need to do now is either:\n\n\n*\n\n*properly configure custom GRUB entries (if you have EFI folders in the root of your Windows partitions you 2 should work if the proper values are supplied)\n\n*or install EFI loaders for each Windows installation to the ESP (see bcdboot command from my answer before, this should copy the .efi binaries to the ESP and generate a BCD configuration even if you booted with legacy booting, this can be difficult though as you have to mount the ESP in Windows) and rerun update-grub in Ubuntu. You should also be able to boot at least Windows 8 directly from the firmware settings when you run bcdboot again from a UEFI booted Windows (this will additionally create NVRAM entries).\n\n\nNote that the Windows 7 version of bcdboot doesn't support the /f switch.\n\nSimply speaking\nIf you booted Windows 8, mounted your EFI System Partition (short ESP, seems to be sda1) to E: and your Windows 7 partition to D:, then run:\nbcdboot C:\\Windows /s E: /f uefi\nbcdboot D:\\Windows /s E: /f uefi\n\nHeads up though, both commands will write to the same location (\\EFI\\Microsoft, I guess) and may overwrite each other, so you may want to make copies (e.g. \\EFI\\Microsoft7 & \\EFI\\Microsoft8). Then boot Ubuntu and run sudo update-grub.\n", "Q: Do I need to install a LAMP server to run nodejs? Using Ubuntu 14.04 - I am trying to control an AR Drone Parrott using nodejs.

(DNS resolving failed) A couple of days ago I was working with ipython notebook and it opens me a page in my web browser (Google Chrome) and I was able to work with the notebook (zero problems with my internet).\nThen, I configure my network connection with a public proxy in order to get access to a blocked webpage, after that I erase the proxy configuration.\nNow, when I open the ipython notebook I get the next error:\n\nERROR: Not Found\nWhile trying to retrieve the URL http://some.localhost:8888/tree:\nDNS resolving failed\nYour cache administrator is webmaster. \n\nMoreover, I have been having internet connection problems, for instance, I have to reload several times a webpage in order to open it, most of the times I get a No internet error despite I am connected.\nSo, the question is: How I get rid of this DNS error?\nAdditional comments: I am in Ubuntu 12.04.

My laptop is a HP Pavilion G62 which has a triple core AMD processor running at 1800mhz. When I launch XBMC from in Windows 7 and look at the processor speeds, it clearly says 1800mhz. However, when I launch it from Ubuntu either from the launcher or as a session, it says the processor is only 800mhz.\nI wanted to investigate further so I loaded up DXDIAG in Windows to see what the speed was. Sure enough, it indicates that it's 1800mhz. However, when launching HardInfo in Ubuntu, it tells me that the speed of each core is as follows: 1500mhz, 1500mhz, and 800mhz.\nDoes this mean that both the advertised processor speed and the speed detected by Windows are lying or rounded off? Or is there a problem with Ubuntu detecting my processor speeds and my system isn't running as optimally as it should? I'd be inclined to say the latter... mainly because it appears that Windows runs far smoother than Ubuntu does.\n\nA: By default Ubuntu uses the ondemand frequency governor. To check/switch governors, install the cpufrequtils package like this:\nsudo apt-get install cpufrequtils\n\nTo check the current speed/governors of each core run:\ncpufreq-info\n\nYou can set all cores to performance like this:\nsudo cpufreq-set -r -g performance\n\nYou can confirm that all cores are now running at their max frequency like this:\ngrep MHz /proc/cpuinfo\n\nNote: this change is temporary. Once you reboot, it'll be back to ondemand.\n\nA: Theoretical background: In a typical computer, the CPU is idle most of the time. To save power, modern CPUs implement frequency scaling - i.e. the operating system can tell the CPU to switch to lower frequency when the load is low. The technology is called SpeedStep in Intel processors and Cool'n'Quiet in AMD processors.\nIn Linux kernel frequency scaling is implemented by cpufreq infrastructure, which uses a concept of \"governors\" to control the frequency.\nThe default governor is \"ondemand\", which increases the frequency once the processor utilisation raises above 95%. This allows CPU to save some power while idle yet to switch to full performance when there are things to do. There is some transition latency, measured in milliseconds, so when an idle CPU suddenly gets a big load it continues to chug at low frequency for a few milliseconds before switching to full power, so in certain situation this may result in slightly lower performance than when always running at full speed. \nThere are other governors, including the \"performance\" governor which always runs the CPU at its full frequency. This eliminates the switching latency, but may increase power consumption.\nYou may experiment with different governors as suggested in another answer, but I doubt it will produce dramatic results. They wouldn't make it a default unless it made sense in 99% of cases :)\nBack to your question, though: most likely, Windows shows you the maximum possible CPU frequency (the one they advertise on the CPU's box), while Ubuntu shows you the actual frequency each of the CPU cores runs with at this particular moment. It does not mean that the CPU runs slower in Ubuntu. If it appears that Ubuntu runs slow on your laptop it most likely is caused by something else - for example, low RAM, slow hard drive etc. Modern Ubuntu certainly requires more resources than, say, Windows XP which you're likely to find on an older laptop. \nMore technical reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using CPUfreq Governors\n\n*CPU frequency and voltage scaling code in the Linux(TM) kernel\n", "Q: muon package manager can't find packages I've a strange problem with muon package manager.\nFor a few days I've been trying to install packages (umlet for example) without success.\nWhen I try to install anything muon says that it cant find the packages to install.\nmuon says for example, that it can't find the package \"http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/libj/libjaxp1.3-java/libjaxp1.3-java_1.3.05-2ubuntu3_all.deb\", despite the fact, that it does exist!\nI did a KDE upgrade, I reinstalled MUON, cleared the /var/lib/apt/lists folder - nothing helps.\nToday I decided to install umlet with the help of APT; and look: it works!\nHow can I fix MUON?\n\nA: ok, at last I found the answer which is very tricky:\nI had used the KDE default browser \"rekonq\" to test public proxies.

While it's a nice feature, it's usually not a performance boost on top of the stock performance of all cores being completely utilized.\n\nYou are mixing things up:\n\nSpeedStep is a trademark for a series of dynamic frequency scaling technologies (codenamed Geyserville and including SpeedStep, SpeedStep II, and SpeedStep III) built into some Intel microprocessors that allow the clock speed of the processor to be dynamically changed (to different P-states) by software.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_speedstep\n\nIntel Turbo Boost is a technology implemented by Intel in certain versions of their Nehalem- [...] Haswell-based CPUs, including Core i5 and Core i7, that enables the processor to run above its base operating frequency via dynamic control of the CPU's clock rate.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost\n\nAll the info in /proc/ and /sys/device/system/cpu/ is always limited to regular frequencies by design; see https://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/boost.txt\n\ncomment by Class Stacker on question Is Turbo Boost Working?\n\nSome CPUs support a functionality to raise the operating frequency of\n  some cores in a multi-core package if certain conditions apply, mostly\n  if the whole chip is not fully utilized and below it's intended thermal\n  budget. The decision about boost disable/enable is made either at hardware\n  (e.g. x86) or software (e.g ARM).\n\nhttps://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/boost.txt\nSimply put, your i5 CPU decides for itself if it applies boost or not and Linux by default doesn't care much about providing accurate and detailed information for this.\n", "Q: Wildcard: return source path I'm trying to rename every access.log.gz file (note: exact filename, not \"beginning with\" or \"containing\") found in /home/*/logs to date-access.log.gz in the same folder.\nfor file in /home/*/logs/access.log.gz\ndo\n   mv -v \"$file\" /home/*/logs/old/`date +\\%G-\\%m-\\%d`\"-access.log.gz\"\ndone\n\nOf course I'm getting /home/*/logs/2014-09-08-access.log.gz - No such file or directory.

I tried with\nmv -v \"$file\" /home/`$1`/logs/old/`date +\\%G-\\%m-\\%d`\"-access.log.gz\"\n\n... but didn't work.\n\nA: Use find (How can I use find command more efficiently?).\nfind /home/ -ipath */logs/access.log.gz\n\nThat should find all the files you're interested in, and print them. You could plug that into your script, but it's probably easier to let  find do all the hard work.\nfind /home/ -ipath */logs/access.log.gz -execdir mv \"{}\" \"old/`date +\\%G-\\%m-\\%d`-access.log.gz\" \\;\n\nThe features of find we're using here are:\n\n\n*\n\n*-ipath matches patterns in the found filenames. You could also use -name if you knew for sure there's only one access.log.gz file in each subpath (-name access.log.gz).\n\n*-execdir executes the given command on each found file, from the subdirectory containing the matched file. This is equivalent to doing cd to where each file is and then running the command there. In this case it saves a lot of path manipulation logic. The found file is substituted for {}. Notice also that \"old\" is given as a relative path (as you said that old/ exists in logs/)\n\n\nA: Simply dissect and re-assemble $file as you iterate over the matching files: ${file%/*} gives you $file with everything after the last / removed, and ${file##*/} gives you $file with everything before the last / removed; taken together ${file%/*}/old/$date-${file##*/} will give you the \"new\" filename corresponding to $file.\nPresumably the date won't change in the course of running your script, so there's no point in invoking date for each and every file; rather, store the date in a variable once, and then use that during the loop: date=$(date '+%G-%m-%d'). (Note that modern scripts should use $(...) rather than backticks. Also note that % is not a \"special\" character and so doesn't need quoting or escaping, though as a matter of good practice the whole format string should be quoted.)\nIf you have a new version of Bash, you can avoid the subshell entirely by using printf -v date '%(%G-%m-%d)T' -1 instead.\nYou might also find it useful to use shopt -s globstar so that you can search to arbitrary depth in the directories, and shopt -s nullglob so that unmatched glob (wildcard) expand to \"nothing\" instead of the original glob pattern.\nPutting these all together we get:\nshopt -s globstar nullglob\ndate=$( date '+%G-%m-%d' )\nfor file in /home/*/logs/**/access.log.gz\ndo\n    target=${file%/*}/old/$date-${file##*/}\n    mv -vi \"$file\" \"$target\"\ndone\n\n\nA: If you have zsh installed, use zmv.

When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the IFS special variable. That is, \"$*\" is equivalent to \"$1c$2c…\", where c is the first character of the value of the IFS variable. If IFS is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces. If IFS is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.\n\n@ Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word. That is, \"$@\" is equivalent to \"$1\" \"$2\" …. If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word.

If there is no match (often because there is no output), then the name of the service is pulled from the nmap-services file based on the port number, and a ? is appended to indicate that this is not a confident result. Port 443 is listed as \"https\" in nmap-services.\nIn the process of service fingerprinting, sometimes the service is detected as SSL/TLS. In this case, the \"service tunnel\" is labeled ssl and the service fingerprinting process starts over inside the encrypted tunnel.

Sometimes when system loads, when I try to search something in web browser using polish letters (ąężźśćółń) I activate keyboard shortcuts (like normally ALT+A should give ą but it does something else, for ex. selects all text in site). If I change language to English and to Polish again (using language button [Pl] in this image ) everything works correctly.

I apologize ahead of time for how confusing this may be. I am very new to things such as partitions, disks, and hard drives. \nWhen I installed Ubuntu there were two options, install on a 24 GB HD and install on a 750 GB HD, the first time I installed I used the 750 GB HD, but had boot issues. I'm now using the 24 GB HD but I want to save files to the 750 GB HD. Is there a way I can merge the two, or at least merge some of the 750 GB HD to the 24 GB HD?\nI've tried using GParted to merge but can't seem to combine the drives. I want the OS to remain on the 24 GB HD but I want my files on the 750 GB HD. I could just try to re-route everything to go to the 750 GB Volume and leave it at that, but is there an easier way.\n  Filesystem                   Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root   16G  3.9G   11G  27% /\nnone                         4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev                         2.9G   12K  2.9G   1% /dev\ntmpfs                        585M  1.2M  584M   1% /run\nnone                         5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone                         2.9G   80K  2.9G   1% /run/shm\nnone                         100M   36K  100M   1% /run/user\n/dev/sda2                    237M   88M  137M  39% /boot\n/dev/sda1                    511M  3.4M  508M   1% /boot/efi\n/dev/sdb2                    693G  192K  693G   1% /media/blah/534E-B317\n\n\nA: First a little background. You seem to have two physical hard drives in your computer, sda and sdb. These are each split into separate partitions. Based on your df output, sda is the 24GB HD and sdb the 750. The sdb2 partition is mounted at /media/blah/534E-B317. Since this is not a standard mount point, I am assuming you have set it up yourself and that it will always be the same, every time you boot. The rest of this answer depends on that. \nSo, you have a 693G partition which is available at /media/blah/534E-B317. All you need to do is copy your files there. Ideally, this should be the default location of any new files you may create as well.\nThe easiest solution is to make your $HOME folder (which, by default, is /home/yourusername) a link to a directory on sdb:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the new directory on sdb (in this and all subsequent steps, replace \"pharaohmoans\" with your actual user name):\nsudo mkdir /media/blah/534E-B317/pharaohmoans\n\n\n*Make it belong to your user\nsudo chown pharaohmoans /media/blah/534E-B317/pharaohmoans\n\n\n*Copy your files over\ncp -rpv $HOME/* /media/blah/534E-B317/pharaohmoans\n\n\n*Rename your old $HOME directory. Once you're sure everything is working fine, you can delete it.\nsudo mv $HOME /home/pharaomoans_backup\n\n\n*Create a symlink pointing to the new directory with the same name as your original $HOME\nsudo ln -s /media/blah/534E-B317/pharaohmoans /home/pharaomoans\n\nNow just log out and log back in again (or restart) and you should be using the new $HOME directory. Any files you create will now be placed here unless you explicitly choose to place them elsewhere. Note that this does not apply to any applications you install. To make those install in the other partition as well, you will need to repeat the above steps for the directory /usr/.\n", "Q: How to clean up/clean out /dev/sda7 when permission is denied? d@d-Satellite-C655:~$ df -h\nFilesystem        Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda7          38G   36G  278M 100% /\nnone              4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev              931M  4.0K  931M   1% /dev\ntmpfs             189M  1.1M  188M   1% /run\nnone              5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone              943M  1.4M  942M   1% /run/shm\nnone              100M   20K  100M   1% /run/user\noverflow          1.0M  1.0M     0 100% /tmp\n/home/d/.Private   38G   36G  278M 100% /home/d\n\nIt appears i've used 100% of /dev/sda7,does anyone know how i might go about cleaning it up or emptying it out, being that, since learning this, i've restarted my computer, and am now unable to log into the administrator account shown above. since then i've successfully logged into the guest account and:\nguest-ihp062@d-Satellite-C655:~$ sudo chmod 755 /dev/sda7 -R\nsudo: unable to change to sudoers gid: Operation not permitted\nguest-ihp062@d-Satellite-C655:~$ sudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo: unable to change to sudoers gid: Operation not permitted\n\nguest-ihp062@d-Satellite-C655:~$ login d\nlogin: Cannot possibly work without effective root\nguest-ihp062@d-Satellite-C655:~$ sudo passwd root\nsudo: unable to change to sudoers gid: Operation not permitted\n\nWhat am i missing?\n\nA: You should be able to boot into recovery mode.

Be warned: as with any low-level disk operations there is always the possibility of data loss so if there is anything important you have that you don't have a backup of then create one first.\n", "Q: How can I use pitch and speed control for audio CDs? On the inner flap of a CD I just purchased and encoded to FLAC, there was a note saying that in order to experience the music at the appropriate pitch level (important for classical music), the pitch has to be adjusted by -3%, resulting in a similar decrease in tempo, which is also appropriate. How can I obtain the decrease in pitch and speed when playing back the .flac files? Doing it via CLI would be a plus but not necessary.\nNote: not the same as How can I modify the pitch of my audio output?, Ubuntu Audio Pitch Shifting filter, How to control Banshee playback speed?, Music/podcast player with speed control?, or any other question that requires pitch is affected but not speed, or vice versa. Also, I am not asking about changing the system-wide audio pitch and speed.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you can import your sound file in Audacity, you will have, in \"Effects\" menu, a \"change speed \" function : you can precisely set speed  to any percent between -100 and +400 .\n\n*Or  with mplayer and speed option,    command line would be :\nmplayer -speed 0.97 soundfile.mp3\n\nA: I think the Audacity option mentioned by @laugeo is a good one, but not CLI as you would  prefer. The mplayer option is a command line one, but is not permanent. \nSince this really only affects one set of files and you don't want to have to think about changing these factors every single time you play them in exclusion to other files that don't need this application, I think it would be better to simply re-encode the files into a version that you can play normally, without having to do something special.\nYou can use the command line tool sox to do this for you. According to its manpage, the speed effect will do the trick:\n\n   speed factor[c]\n          Adjust  the  audio  speed (pitch and tempo together).  factor is\n          either the ratio of the new speed to the old speed: greater than\n          1  speeds  up,  less than 1 slows down, or, if appended with the\n          letter `c', the number of cents (i.e. 100ths of a  semitone)  by\n          which  the  pitch (and tempo) should be adjusted: greater than 0\n          increases, less than 0 decreases.\n\n\nSo for each file you would do:\nsox /path/to/input.flac /path/to/output.flac speed 0.97 \n\nIf you want to go crazy with it, you can try to mess with the rate effect, as mentioned in the end of the notes on speed:\n\n          Technically, the speed  effect  only  changes  the  sample  rate\n          information, leaving the samples themselves untouched.  The rate\n          effect is invoked automatically to resample to the output sample\n          rate,  using  its  default quality/speed.  For higher quality or\n          higher speed  resampling,  in  addition  to  the  speed  effect,\n          specify the rate effect with the desired quality option.\n\n\nHere's the info on rate summarized for you.\n\n   rate [-q|-l|-m|-h|-v] [override-options] RATE[k]\n          Change  the audio sampling rate (i.e. resample the audio) to any\n          given RATE (even non-integer if this is supported by the  output\n          file format) using a quality level defined as follows:\n\n\n                       Quality   Band-   Rej dB   Typical Use\n                                 width\n                 -q     quick     n/a    ≈30 @    playback on\n                                          Fs/4    ancient hardware\n                 -l      low      80%     100     playback on old\n                                                  hardware\n                 -m    medium     95%     100     audio playback\n                 -h     high      95%     125     16-bit mastering\n                                                  (use with dither)\n                 -v   very high   95%     175     24-bit mastering\n\n\n          The simple quality selection described above  provides  settings\n          that satisfy the needs of the vast majority of resampling tasks.\n          Occasionally, however, it may  be  desirable  to  fine-tune  the\n          resampler's   filter   response;  this  can  be  achieved  using\n          override options, as detailed in the following table:\n\n\n          -M/-I/-L     Phase response = minimum/intermediate/linear\n          -s           Steep filter (band-width = 99%)\n          -a           Allow aliasing/imaging above the pass-band\n          -b 74-99.7   Any band-width %\n          -p 0-100     Any phase response (0 = minimum, 25 = intermediate,\n                       50 = linear, 100 = maximum)\n\nSo if you wanted highest standard quality and 48kHz sample rate your command would grow to:\nsox /path/to/input.flac /path/to/output.flac speed 0.97 rate -v 48k\n\n", "Q: Can we set up a shortcut to run latex in LibreOfiice?

Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nE: Unable to locate package gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme\n\nany help? Thanks!\nUPDATE:\nit's not the lack of an extension, I know I have it installed, and there is no pink banner. The page does not load any button for me to install (or the user reviews section.) The page does load on chromium (with the pink banner though, no extension) so I don't think its a network issue. Also, the 'duplicate'page is not my exact issue. And I tried this on firefox, which has the right extension on it by default.\n\nA: You can install only official gnome extensions available in Ubuntu repo using sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions.\nTo install other extensions you need Firefox browser. Visit https://extensions.gnome.org/ to install all the available extention. \nIf you see webpage like this  \nIt means that you need to install  GNOME 3 Integration plugin in your browser. Install it from here. \nOnce plugin added to your browser, you can install all the available extensions from https://extensions.gnome.org/.\n", "Q: What is Upstream Program? Maybe it is a ridiculous question but I want to know exactly what is an upstream program?\nhere in this documentation and other debian packaging documentation mentioned  upstream program.\nI want a definition to create upstream from my application.\nFor example is my web application which is written in java is an upstream?\n\nA: Think of upstream and downstream as if you're standing in the middle of a river. \"Upstream\" is where the water flows from, \"downstream\" is where it flows to.\nIn very few words, an \"upstream\" program (or library) is when it is retrieved from the developers, as opposed to \"downstream\" which means you retrieve it from your distribution of choice - such as Debian. You can package an upstream program to make it available \"downstream\", which is what the Debian manual entry explains.\nSomeone explained this even better, here:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/195952/what-does-upstream-and-downstream-mean\nand\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_%28software_development%29\n\nA: See the Wikipedia for that query http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(software_development)\n", "Q: Is it bad to chown /media/USERNAME for your web server? I've been trying to get this software working for my webserver. It's called ownCloud. I had partitioned my hard drive just to host my files on my web server.\nI made a new partition (128gb) and I've been trying to get it to work with ownCloud. But it will not work whatever I do. \nIt says this:\nData directory (/media/user/2CF254B6F254864C/ownCloud/data) is invalid\n\nPlease check that the data directory contains a file \".ocdata\" in its root.\nCannot create \"data\" directory (/media/user/2CF254B6F254864C/ownCloud/data)\n\nThis can usually be fixed by giving the webserver write access to the root directory.\n\nEven though I have that all there.\nSo, someone on their forum told me to use\nchown -R www-data:www-data /media/user/2CF254B6F254864C/ownCloud/data, so I did.\nBut it didn't work. So then I kept going down the directories, chown'ing them.\nI have www-data access to /media/user/ Is this a bad thing? I remember I had to reinstall because I accidentally chmod'ed root with 777.\nHow can I get this to work?\n\nA: If you think that the root problem lies with the owner of the mountpoint then in the mount options you can specify uid and gid to set the user and group respectively for the mount.  Read the manual page, man mount, for the specification of those options.\n\nA: I have the same problem \nData directory (...) is invalid  Please check that the data directory contains a file \".ocdata\" in its root.\n\nwhen i try to transfer my data folder from a partition to other one, and i  change the permissions of .ocdata and did not work. \nMy solution was change the owner (not recursive) to mount's point partition and all work well:\n$ chown www-data:www-data /mount_point \n\n\nHola\nTuve el mismo problema\nData directory (...) is invalid  Please check that the data directory contains a file \".ocdata\" in its root.\n\nCuando traté de transferir mi carpeta de datos de una partición a otra, y cambié los permisos de .ocdata pero no funcionó.\nMi solución fue cambiar el propietario (no recursivo) al punto de montaje de la partición nueva y todo funcionó bien:\n$ chown www-data:www-data /mount_point \n\n", "Q: Brightness Problem Hello there Linux user I am a new user and I don't know how to turn down my brightness of my laptop when I change it with the keys it show on the screen going down but the screen is not dimming I don't know why and I will really like to know why since i want to use this a long time please help my laptop type\nis :Acer Asphire-V5-561PG 6819\nVersion is there any fix please help\n\nA: Expanding on the current answer, get the output name of your screen by running:\nxrandr --current\n\nYou can determine if the screen is running if it has 'connected' next to it. For me, the display was called\neDP1\n\nSo, I can change the brightness by runnning\nxrandr --output eDP1 --brightness 0.5 \n\nAnd replacing 0.5 with any value\n\nA: Open the terminal.

But there a no factors? If it is there is can be executed. If an admin wants to prevent execution (s)he needs to use a tool to block access (acl is one of those tools). \n\nHow does the system differentiate that what softwares installed in /usr are installed by which user.\n\nIt does not and does not need to. The admin installs the software, the users use it and by default with no restrictions. \n\nI am assuming that if user B now installs something else, then all the data related to that will also be in /usr/ directory (RIGHT?)\n\nIf B is a normal user he is unlikely to be able to install since he will need the admin password. If A and B are admin then the admin installs software (it does not matter if that admin is user A or user B).\nSoftware that needs to store settings or data will store this in the users home. The software is installed once but the user content (settings, personal data) is shared over all of the users /home's. \n\nAlso, any of the packages installed by any of the user do not go in /bin folder right? That is specific to system binaries.\n\nYes. /bin is supposed to be clear of any non-system binaries. But is depends on what is installed: it could be software that has a system binary and that will end up in /bin or /sbin if applicable.\n\nWhat if there are no users on my system. Will there be no files in /usr folder? ie in my office, when I remote login to a server, it shows no user in home directory. \n\nThat does not mean there are no users. If you remote login on my server I would shield my /home/ from you. \nEvery Linux system MUST have at least 1 user. At a minimum there must be an admin (could be root or a normal user with sudo permissions).\n\nA: Beware that some software do no go to /usr/bin, but will use /opt/myprojet or /home/myproject, and you have to put /opt/myproject/bin on you $PATH.\nBy default most software install are owned by root or bin, and anyone, A and B n your example will/could use it.\nSome software, I think about Oracle are owned by a different user, in which case you (A or B) have to be of a specific group.\n", "Q: Find files that are heavily used in the system atopsar -d 30 - shows that one of hard drive (sda) in the system is heavily used.\nIs there a way to know which files are heavily used on HDD?\n\nA: You can use lsof (man lsof).

Install 14.04 in a virtualbox and then install all the normal software you use to try it out first.\nHere're the problems I had when upgrading...\n\n\n*\n\n*One annoying problem is the \"diskfilter writes are not supported\" message, it can brick a remote server.

And if you're using an old project that hasn't been updated for a while it may not compile.  Best to test that first.\n\nA: \nI wonder if there could be any unsolvable problem updating to 14.04.1\n\nIt is impossible for us to answer your question with \"yes\". In general it will work but your system might have all kinds of tweaks and changes that can interfere with your upgrade. \nMind you: if your files are important to you you already make a regular backup and also reguraly check if you can restore that backup.

I have installed MATLAB on ubuntu 14.04 and when I type matlab the installation doesn't come up. It is even not showing in the ubuntu software center. But I could perfectly run MATLAB using the command prompt. \n\nA: You can run it from the command prompt but you need to know the directory it was installed. The default path is in /usr/local/MATLAB_VERSION where MATLAB_VERSION is the Matlab version you have installed.\nTo run it just type:\n/usr/local/MATLAB_VERSION/bin/matlab &\n\nYou can also create shortcut to your Desktop.

One of the reasons I believe that having /home on a separate hard drive was that it would be easier to maintain you're data if you need to do a re-install. \nMy question though is it as simple as just running a new install on the OS hard drive or do you need to do certain steps (apart from a back-up) before re-installing Ubuntu?\nFor example do you need to use same username/computername and passwords?\nIn my case Ubuntu 14.04 is the only OS used and I have encrypted the OS but not /home.\n\nA: \nWhat to do when reinstalling Ubuntu when /home on a seperate HDD?\n\nMount /home but do not set it to format the partition. Use the same username during re-installation.\n\nFor example do you need to use same username\n\nNo, but it would be adviced. If you use another name you will end up with TWO users in /home each with their own permissions and (same) user ID. You will need to do a lot of manual work to have both work together.

These are, however, often set as environmental variables in one of the Bash or login startup files.\nSource: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/internalvariables.html\n\nA: While you don't have to manually substitute your username for $USER, you can if you like. You just have to put it in place of the whole \"word\" $USER, not just USER. That is, leave off the $ in what you write:\nsudo chown tejas /usr/local/src\n\nThis is because $ before a \"name\" signifies it is the name of a variable and that the variable should be dereferenced--that is, replaced by the value stored in it. USER is an environment variable that holds your username.\nIn contrast, tejas is (probably) not defined (in the sense of being a variable that has been assigned some value). In a shell, a variable that is not defined is treated, in most ways, like it is empty--i.e., holding the empty (i.e., zero-length) string of text. So $tejas is replaced by nothing and the command that actually gets run is sudo chown /usr/local/src, which cannot work.\n", "Q: Sharing Installing Ubuntu with an NTFS data partition Will I be allowed to install Ubuntu on to a 1.5gig HDD of which half of the drive is dedicated to an NTFS data partition, no OS is installed.\nThank you.\n\nA: Yes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu must be installed on a filesystem that support permissions (ext is the current default choice).

So, two simple commands. Both \"work\" when entered at the command line.\nThe script is created and executed every time a normal user logs in, so I need a method to make this script executable at that time. So far, I cannot get this to work. For example, the first part mkdir /vvv/gggg doesn't proceed because the script is not executable (I'm guessing).\nHope this makes sense. Is this possible? Any thoughts on how to make this work will be appreciated. \nUpdate:\nThanks for your responses. I probably should add some additional information other than that I'm new to Linux.\nI'm using an open source virtual desktop application called Ulteo. This App runs on top of Ubuntu and has very little support - that why i'm here. Basically, I'm learning by fire.\nSo, there application has a login script management function where I can tie a script to a user. A simple windows script with net use works perfectly fine. However, when I try to apply a Linux bash script nothing happens.\nI'm thinking that because I need to perform a chmod +x against the script first to make the script executable, this is why its failing. By the way, Ulteo runs in a chroot jail. I've created a script, saved it and could not find the script. I searched both inside and outside the chroot jail.\nI like the approach by dan08 to have the initial script reference another script that i can find and make executable manually. Would I run into the same problem?\nDoes this additional information clarify the situation? Thanks in advance.\nPhotos attached.\n![login scipt management console][1]\n![windows scripts that work][2]\n![simple linux script that doesn't work][3]\nSorry I Can't post images yet\n\nA: Rather than making your script executable, you can take a different approach and change the way you call the script.\nscript.sh is enough to run an executable script.\nHowever\nIt is possible to run a non-exectuable script if you specify the program to run it.\nSo /bin/bash script.sh or bash script.sh or python script.py will all run non-executable scripts.\nSo my suggestion would be to edit the way that the script is called, and specify the binary used to run it.\n\nA: There are two things you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reference the script interpreter at the beginning of the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\n*Set the permissions to make it executable:\nchmod +x myscript.sh\n\n\nA: Create a program in C,C++ or Python etc. and use the system command to execute the bash script.\nFor example a C program would look like:\n#include \"stdio.h\"\nint main(int argc, char const *argv[])\n{\n    system('chmod +x path/yourbashscript.sh');\n    system('path/yourbashscript.sh');\n    return 0;\n}\n\nTo execute the program at startup add it to the list of startup programs.\nOpen Startup Applications from your dash and add the compiled executable to the list by clicking add button.\n\nA: You can make your bash script executable by running the following in the command line. \ncd ~/path/to/file\nchmod +x nameoffile.sh\n\nThen, making it executed at start up can be done by adding it to your list of startup programs as  @akabhirav said.\n\nA: SHC is a generic shell script compiler. It takes a script, which is specified on the command line and produces C source code. The generated source code is then compiled and linked to produce a stripped binary.\nThe compiled binary will still be dependent on the shell specified in the first line of the shell code (the shebang: #!/bin/sh or such), thus SHC does not create completely independent binaries.\nSHC itself is not a compiler such as cc. Rather encodes and encrypts a shell script and generates C source code with the added expiration capability. It then uses the system compiler to compile a stripped binary which behaves exactly like the original script. Upon execution, the compiled binary will decrypt and execute the code with the shell's -c option.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on a USB Flash Drive?

The current 12.04 list is below:\n$ apt-cache rdepends runit\nrunit\nReverse Depends:\n  dropbear\n  dropbear\n  vblade-persist\n  twoftpd-run\n  twoftpd\n |tinydyndns\n  socklog-run\n  socklog\n  roundup\n |qmail-run\n  mailfront\n  ipsvd\n  git-daemon-run\n  dropbear\n  dnscache-run\n  djbdns\n  dbndns\n  daemontools-run\n  daemontools\n  cereal\n  bcron-run\n  bcron\n\n", "Q: Weird screen tearing behaviour with scrolling after updating Nvidia drivers So I updated my self to the latest stable Nvidia driver. It is 340.32 version. I am using Ubuntu 14.04 with it.\nEverything is fine but if I try to scroll in some programs like for instance Gedit or just the Ubuntu Software Center, then some weird behavior happens.\nHere is a link to a recording of the problem: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bdszhpa8uivmmhb/20140909_172712.mp4?dl=0\nThe quality is not the best but you can see that I only scroll down one time and then the screen in Gedit starts to move up and down and also some graphical anomalies appear. \nThis problem does not happen with Chromium and games for instance. But stuff like Gedit is bugged for me.\nHas anyone else experienced this? What could fix it?\n\nA: This may be related to a Compiz bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz/+bug/1288747\nWhat fixed this issue for me was going back to Nvidia driver 331.38 by doing this:\n(Ubuntu 14.04 x64)\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Nvidia driver:\nCtrl-Alt-F1\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo sh NVIDIA*.run --uninstall\n\n*Remove any Noveau files (blacklist) located in /etc/modprobe.d\n\n*sudo reboot\n\n*Software & Updates, Additional Drivers, Nvidia 331.38 from nvidia-331-updates\n\nA: In the meantime you can use the patched version of compiz that is provided by Christopher Townsend's PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~townsend/+archive/ubuntu/compiz-nvidia-refresh-test\nSimply add the PPA and update the compiz package, then you can use the latest nvidia drivers.  Note that any updates to compiz by Canonical should be held back if you want to keep the PPA version in place.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have both libav and ffmpeg installed and running on ubuntu 14.04? I want to use Clementine but it needs ffmpeg to be installed if I want to play .ape files from it.\nOn the other way, I still want to have VLC up and running, and I understand that VLC does no longer use ffmpeg, but libav. (by the way, VLC plays all audio formats I have, including .ape files).\nSo, my question is: if I install ffmpeg, will libav still be operational (thus allowing me to use VLC), or will it override libav functionality, thus causing VLC to fail?\nThe reason I'm asking this here instead of simply trying to install ffmpeg is because the last time I installed it VLC stoped working and I only could get it working again reinstalling Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: On 14.04, clementine is still using the gstreamer0.10 plugins and since ape support is provided by the ffmpeg plugin you need to set up the following PPA to play ape files:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg\n\nI tested both vlc and clementine at the same time using this sample file (sh3.ape) and it works flawlessly:\n\n", "Q: apt-get update says E: Sub-process returned an error code I am getting this error whenever I try and run any apt-get command.

also be noted that if you get a E: Sub-process returned an error code when running any something like apt-get remove [pkg] or get errors when you run apt-get update you might want to make sure your /tmp directory was not deleted.\nRecreating the /tmp directory fixed my error as no application could utilize a temporary directory to store temporary files. As referenced by the last reply here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1677090.\nI made this answer for completeness.\n\nA: Is it possible that you have an incomplete install? If that's the case, you can correct it using sudo apt-get install -f. That might solve your issue.\nIf that doesn't clear up the error when you run sudo apt-get update again, you could try running \nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nIn the past, if dpkg was the subprocess that was giving the error, it would usually show up in the error message, but maybe it is still the source of your issues.\n\nA: I had /tmp existing but it had unnecessary files/dirs that I removed:\nrm -rf /tmp/*\n\nExecuted sudo apt update and it worked normally.\n\nA: I use these two commands and it works fine.\nsudo apt-get remove libappstream3\nsudo apt remove libappstream3\n\n", "Q: System is freezing (or getting stuck) frequently, while working in ubuntu 14.04 My system is Dell XPS L502X, with NVIDIA graphics card 525M. For your notice, it is different from this and not completely related to this.\nI was having problem of black screen after opening the Ubuntu 14.04. To get out of it\nI reinstalled Ubuntu 14.04.\nAfter re-installing and adding NVIDIA drivers, system is getting freezed, frequently. So only option left is to press,Alt+F1, then Alt+F7\n\n\nA: Are you sure it's 100% related to the video driver?

These take certain actions to make the system faster.\nExecute sudo apt-get install prelink preload in a terminal.\n\n\n*Reduce Swap usage. The default swappiness value is 60, which may be too high.\nOpen the file /etc/sysctl.conf and set the swappiness parameter:\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf in a terminal.\nNew line at the end: vm.swappiness = 10, then another linebreak, save with Ctrl+O.\nIf you apply these changes, your computer should get faster after a reboot.\nFor your touchpad, you should ask a new question, since this is another problem.\n", "Q: Jitsi not logging to asterisk from ubuntu with SIP I'm trying to use the jitsi client to connect with SIP to an asterisk server.\nIf I give my account name, I get a password error; if I give my extension, I get a time out.\nI can log in with the extension from a windows jitsi client with the same parameters.\nAll software has been installed in the last few days with the last versions (jitsi 2.4.4997 and 2.5.5065 on Ubuntu, jitsi 2.4.4997 on windows), Asterisk 11.12 compiled from source). \nI tried with and without firewall results are the same.

I have installed zentyal 3.5 from the Zentyal PPA on a fresh ubuntu 14.04 installation.  After a few tests I want to uninstall zentyal.  Unfortunately, there are no instructions as to how to remove it.\nWhat I did to remove the software was this:  I removed the zentyal PPA and ran sudo apt-get remove zentyal-*  But now, network manager doesn't work any more, and my system doesn't get DHCP assigned addresses.\nHow can I revert to a 'fresh' 14.04 installation to completely remove Zentyal?\n\nA: Never use the remove command with packageName ended with *, as it will possibly damage your system or erase other packages' requirements.\nRun sudo apt-get purge zentyal to remove the installed zentyal package, \nand then run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade.\nIt should fix the problem.\n", "Q: remove systemd components in ubuntu 14.04 Is it possible to remove all installed components of systemd (may the inventors r. i. p.) in ubuntu 14.04 and replace them with ... well, how it was before?\nIf so, which packages are to be purged and which installed in their stead?\n\nA: The init system I believe is the component you are referring to.  There are 2 major Branches of init systems\n\n\n*\n\n*BSD Init\n\n*SysV Init\n\nTLDR\nSystemD is a child of SysV.  It replaced Upstart(which was also a replacement for SysV) starting in Ubuntu 14.10.  Every major distro of Linux now uses systemd as the default init system.  The only one that I can think of that still uses SysV is Gentoo, and our userbase is split on the issue of adoption of systemd as the default.\n\nThe major reasons that systemd is used is for ease of configuration, and that upstream GNOME has adopted it as the default init for the GNOME 3.X Desktop.  Consequently, Unity was created as a replacement for GNOME at the release of about Ubuntu 12 due to a disagreement on how to proceed between Upstart and systemd.\n\nThe short answer is No, you cannot go back to SysV, as the init system is chosen by the Ubuntu OS Maintainers at Canonical\n", "Q: Which graphic card driver is safer?

Look at waifu2x \nThat is exactly what you are looking for. \nComparison with GIMP\n\nA: Open the file in GIMP. In the menu bar at the top, select Image > Scale Image. I suggest you leave the aspect ratio locked. Change the pixel dimension for, for instance, the height to whatever you desire. Save and close GIMP.\nCaution: the original image is just 165x180 pixels. Scaling up will show somewhat poor quality as you cannot recover the detail that was lost when the image was previously scaled down.

Run that and the system will automagically try to fix any problems Windows may have.\nNote that this might break GRUB2, thus not letting you into Ubuntu. To fix this, use an Ubuntu Live CD and run this command in an elevated terminal:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nReplace /dev/sda with whatever your Drive Identifier is.

Ideally, I would like to just completely wipe the drive and remove all partitions, so I am working with a blank slate, as it will be easier to install a dual boot with Windows and then Linux.\nI tried to reformat the largest partition of my drive to NTFS so I could install Windows (using gparted), but was given the message \n\"You are formatting over non-empty LVM2 Physical Volume /dev/sda3\nDeleting or overwriting the Physical Volume is irrecoverable and will damage or destroy the volume group\"\nIt advises me to use LVM to free physical volume before attempting to reformat.\nNow here's the question: how would I safely free the volume up in LVM so that I can reformat with gparted?\nOr, if the ultimate goal is to erase all partitions and format the drive for NTFS, would it be better to just forcibly reformat?  Could this cause physical damage to my drive?\nSorry for the noobery, I am in way over my head here and I don't want to wreck my drive or something.  Can give more information as needed.\n\nA: No, you will not damage your drive (unless you have bad sectors).\nThink of LVM as a partition that can hold other partitions.

You can specify either the amount by which you want to reduce the size of the volume or the final size that you want to achieve:\nsudo su\nlvreduce --size -48,8G /dev/vg0/sda5\nor\nlvreduce --size 100G /dev/vg0/sda5\n\nNote: If the logical volume contains a filesystem that you wish to preserve then you must not make the volume smaller than the filesystem.\nVerify the size of the logical volume using the lvdisplay command:\nsudo su\nlvdisplay /dev/vg0/sda5\n\nSource: https://wiki.debian.org/LVM\n", "Q: ran out of space on disc? still have 30gb free I tried to install steam and ubuntu told me I only had a few megs left. but my partition says it has 30gb free.\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sdb5       6.9G  6.3G  236M  97% /\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev            1.9G   12K  1.9G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           396M  1.2M  395M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            2.0G   89M  1.9G   5% /run/shm\nnone            100M   52K  100M   1% /run/user\n/dev/sdb1       138G  130G  8.7G  94% /media/randy/New Volume\n/dev/sda1        75G   48G   27G  64% /media/randy/F440B04040B00B7E\n\n\nA: Note these lines:\n/dev/sdb5       6.9G  6.3G  236M  97% /\n/dev/sdb1       138G  130G  8.7G  94% /media/randy/New Volume\n/dev/sda1        75G   48G   27G  64% /media/randy/F440B04040B00B7E\n\nThe first line is important. That shows how much space your Ubuntu installation has in its root partition. As you can see, it has very little (not that it had much to begin with). That you have 30G free elsewhere (in /media/randy/F440B04040B00B7E - an NTFS partition, by the looks of it) doesn't help Ubuntu all that much.\n\nA: A certain amount of disk space will be reserved for the: root user so that that user will always be able to function even if regular users are erroring because of no space.  A secondary reason for the reservation is that the file-system itself requires a certain amount of free space to operate correctly.  This is related to why Linux file-systems do not need to be defragmented and Windows file-systems do.  The way the files are laid out on Linux systems means that fragmenting: does not occur as long as there is a certain amount of free space.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Suddenly Won't Boot I ran into a really odd problem today. I tried to boot my ubuntu partition, and I got a flashing screen that showed only black with a mouse cursor. Eventually it said restoring resolver state, and something about saned.

I ran boot-repair to create this log http://paste.ubuntu.com/8304401/ . Was wondering if anyone had any ideas? I heard someone mention it might be my graphics drivers after an update, but not for sure. If you need info just let me know what. \n\nA: So Finally got it fixed. Eliah Kagan, your fix worked, but only to get it to boot, and I had to do that every time I rebooted. On top of that, it still didn't work quite right, for example transparency wouldnt work in unity3d. I found this thread Experiencing major issues on graphic displays, and it solved my problems. However, I didn't downgrade, when it says to downgrade your kernel instead I went into synaptic and reinstalled all the linux-image, linux-header, etc. that were currently installled. I also did not need to run step 3. \nNote to anyone who may have the same problem.

Can anyone provide guidance? Thanks so much!\n\nA: Take a look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2229766  for the forum staff recommendations on WUBI.   It really is not for 14.04 anymore.\n\nA: The Xubuntu folks decided they didn't want to support Wubi so it was removed from the choices. You could try and install 14.04 and then download the Xubuntu desktop. However, there are issues in installing 14.04. Wubi is currently not downloading the iso - it hangs / freezes / stalls. You can download it yourself via a torrent client or download manager or your browser and put it next to wubi.exe in a separate directory. But then there is a bug in the MD5 check that was introduced either in 12.10 or after 12.10, so you have to open a command shell and do \"wubi --skipmd5check\". This mostly works,  but then you run into another bug that is discussed in an Ubuntu support forum and here.

I get some \"failure reading sector errors\" (details below). I've tried running boot repair several times, with a few different options checked at this point (details below), but I can't get it to work. Dual boot situation, was able to access Windows when problem started, but now selecting Windows brings me to a Grub terminal as well. \nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/8298591\n\nFull Details:\nI've got some issues going on with my Grub installation. I'll detail what's going on first, and then I'll try and give the background of what's been going on.\nYesterday evening, my Ubuntu froze up on me and I had to perform a hard/manual shutdown of the computer. When I went to reboot, it wasn't allowing me to boot into my Grub screen (I believe at the time I was getting the Grub terminal, but I'm not 100% certain at this point anymore). Anyways, this isn't the first time this has happened (more on that later), so I went ahead and ran the Boot Repair tool. I had a few problems with it last time, but I figured I'd try again anyways.\nFirst attempt, I got the notice that my PC was in Legacy mode but I disregarded it, and proceeded to run the repair anyways in default mode. No luck.\nSecond attempt, I got my computer out of Legacy mode, booted into Ubuntu through the EFI (on a flash drive), and ran the repair again. Default mode. It booted into the Grub menu and it looked like it would work. I selected Ubuntu, and I get a bunch of errors:\nerror: failure reading sector 0x74706da0 from 'hd2'.\nerror: failure reading sector 0x74706d00 from 'hd2'.\nerror: failure reading sector 0x0 from 'hd2'.\nerror: failure reading sector 0x74706da0 from 'hd2'.\nerror: failure reading sector 0x74706d00 from 'hd2'.\nerror: failure reading sector 0x0 from 'hd2'.\nerror: no such device: 4c536822-6b4d-4c08-88e3-2694bc7cd0be.\n\nAfter that, it takes me to the Grub prompt where I just get the standard:\nGrub>\n\nInteresting to me, I have 2 options in the EFI/BIOS for Linux (not including the USB option), and a Windows option as well. It does not matter at all which option I take (less the USB), I always end up at the Grub terminal - even if I select Windows.\nI've tried the backup and rename Windows EFI option as well (sort of blindly, primarily because it was one I could simply set back if it didn't change anything). It didn't change a thing. FWIW, at one point this evening, I was still able to boot into Windows while Linux was unavailable.\nThe history of this problem is that it just did a similar thing just over a week ago. I fixed it with the boot repair tool, with the default settings. However, when I did fix it, I wasn't able to boot into Linux with the EFI. I had to go through in Legacy mode, which I suspect was a problem that I created. I think I probably booted into Legacy mode and ran the repair from there, but I'm not quite certain at this point. Both times I've had these problems it came after a unplanned hard shutdown - power once & frozen OS the second time. \nHere's a boot repair log that I just generated with the most recent changes represented.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/8298591/\nMy initial thought with all of the disk access errors would tell me that I might have a disk problem, and particularly since I had a similar issue just about a week ago. However, I'm fairly certain I've got an issue with the actual EFI on HD1 right now, due to the fact that I can't even get into Windows - and with my limited knowledge of EFIs, I don't really think that can be tied to each other... but I don't know - hopefully someone can tell me! :)\nThanks for reading and thanks in advance for any help you might be able to provide.\nKind regards.\n\nA: After a hard shutdown you often have to make repairs.

I recently bought a C720 Chromebook and have since put Ubuntu on it. The only problem I have so far is the limited amount of disk space left on the SSD. \nI was wondering if it'd be possible to install apps onto an SD card or USB drive maybe even an external hard drive and run the files from there.\nI read into symlinks but I don't really know where to start with those, At the moment I'm trying to install Skype and Steam onto my SD Card without taking up the remaining space on my SSD.\n\nA: Applications get installed on internal memory which is faster and they are run from there directly. You can save non-applications like songs, videos, and other things on SD card though. If you are very low on internal memory then uninstall some not so frequently used applications.\n\nA: Move apps from. Ext.sdcard to internal sd to use then backup again when done. Problem is moving appsupport from ext.sdcard.\n\nA: I am trying vm-ware on an external 64 size card to run another copy of linux onto Ubuntu and load my programs in virtual machine.

I want to create a file manifest (list of file/folder names, directory structure, and file metadata) of my home folder. I do not want the actual content of the files to be saved.\nHow can this be done (preferrably without the terminal)?\n\nA: Solution 1: Metadata only [Edit]\nSo according to somebody's recent edit you may only want to backup file system structure and metadata non-periodically. This can be done easily:\nfind /home/furioususer -ls\n\nwill list all files and directories in the directory /home/furioususer along with some metadata. To redirect the output to the file /path/to/backups/file use\nfind /home/furioususer -ls > /path/to/backups/file\n\nYou might want to give the file some meaningful name based on user name and time of backup:\nfind /home/furioususer -ls > \"/path/to/backups/furioususer.metadata.$(date +%F_%T%z)\"\n\n$(date +%F_%T%z) tells the shell to execute the subcommand date +%F_%T%z and replace it by the output of that command. (Go ahead an try to run that command directly to see the result and toy with it!) The quotation marks are necessary to prevent most special characters (e. g. spaces and colons) like they appear in that date string from being misinterpreted. Of course you can choose any other (programmatically generated) file path you deem appropriate.\nYou can tune the data you're actually interested in (e. g. size, owner, group, permissions, mtime, atime) by substituting -ls with -printf <YOUR FORMAT STRING>. For details on that option look up the manual. Example with file path, file size, owner, access permissions and last time of modification:\nfind /home/furioususer -printf \"%p: %s bytes, owned by %u, permissions %m, last change %t\\n\"\n\nSince this may become quite large yet well compressible, you can pipe that through a compressor like xz:\nfind /home/furioususer -ls | xz > \"/path/to/backups/furioususer.metadata.$(date +%F_%T%z).xz\"\n\nYou can generalise this command a little by using environment variables (of the form ${}) instead of hard-coding your home path and user name, that the shell will then substitute with their respective values:\nfind \"${HOME}\" -ls | xz > \"/path/to/backups/${USER}.metadata.$(date +%F_%T%z).xz\"\n\nRestoring from this automatically is quite another story, but I don't know how this would be of any use as you'd be pretty much dead in the water without actual file data.\nIf you don't want to fiddle with the command line every time, you can create a shell script using a graphical text editor and an application starter pointing to it with an application starter editor.\nSolution 2: Déjà-Dup\n… offers various backup options – offline and online – some of which seem to suit your needs. It's also well integrated with Nautilus, so you can easily review and restore previous versions of files. I never tried it personally but I researched its possibilities intensely a while ago.\nSolution 3: Copy-on-write snaphots\nThe most flexible and resource saving (offline) solution I know for this is to put your home directory on a Btrfs volume¹ and perform periodic snapshots of it. The last time I looked (about 1 year ago) there was no off-the-shelf tool to do this and I invested a couple of afternoons in modifying, tweaking and testing other people's shell scripts to make them work the way I want.\nThe whole deployment can technically be done without touching the command line yourself if you reuse existing work, but due to the experimental state of things you'll likely reach points where it would be a lot easier to do so. Therefore I expect this to be no suitable solution for you but it may be for other people.\nIf asked to, I will provide code, instructions and links for working solutions including my own.\n¹ ext3/4 can be converted to Btrfs without trouble\n", "Q: Do I need to install anything else? I am a new Linux user I just swapped over from Windows. Well rather I'm dual booting but plan to use Ubuntu as my primary OS from now on. I just installed Python 2.7.8 and in the thread that I read the instructions from the poster said that it was required that I install some dependencies. However, Python runs fine and I haven't installed anything else. I was wondering if this was just an older thing as the thread was installing Python 2.7.5 on an older version of Ubuntu (I am using 14.04 lts). I'll link the other thread below. If anyone can tell me why he installed the dependencies and if I need them that would be great. Thanks in advance for any help. \nTo clarify I was looking for anything that I needed to install before I could use Python 2.7.8 without issues, but this was before I learned that a version of Python shipped with Ubuntu. So I now have Python 2.7.8 and Python 3.4 (although my computer only shows Python 3.4 in the software center) as long as it is ok to have two different installs of different versions of Python without any drastic issues then I'm fine. I was just wondering if there was anything else that needed to be installed for them to work properly.\nHow do I install the latest Python 2.7.X or 3.X on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Ubuntu and apt in general have a very cool feature called \"Dependency Resolution.\" \nMeaning, it will automatically install all required dependencies for you at the time of install. If it cannot, it will usually complain and the program will not work.\nIn your case, it sounds like everything installed and dependency resolution did its job right.\nFFR, apt will always let you know if something is wrong. If it doesn't say something is wrong, it worked.\n\nA: Python is installed by default with Ubuntu, so if you were \"upgrading\" from an older version to the most up to date (at the point in the linked question it appears to be 2.7.2) However currently 2.7.2 is not the most up to date version at this moment. Even for python 2.X, 2.7.8 was latest upgrade. \nAs a side note, depending on how much you are running python programs, you may wish to have both 2.X, and 3.X installed.(Where 'X' is whatever version number after dot) The reason for this is, the language has different semantics, and it is sometimes just easier to have both, versus editing code.\n\nOther information:\nFrom command line to run pre-3 python:\npython filename.py\nFrom command line to run python 3.X:\npython3 filename.py\n", "Q: Can I remove cpp from Ubuntu without causing any issues? I have a C++ compiler installed on a Ubuntu server I am using as a LAMP stack. Will it cause issues for me to remove C++?\n\nA: You shouldn't have any issues with a server not having a compiler installed.\nNormally a compiler does not belong to a LAMP server for security reasons. It \"helps\" an attacker to type in some code, compile it to a program, execute it and do a lot more damage.\nA possible exception is if you have a device driver not part of the standard distro. Every time you update the kernel you would have to recompile that driver.\n", "Q: Graphical error while installing I am relatively new to Ubuntu and even newer to this community. \nUbuntu refuses to install and the screen goes nuts.

Old habits are hard to break but the sooner the better. You're gonna have to scrap the whole mentality of downloading an .exe from whoever and installing whatever to your system. That's one of the many reasons windows has so much malware (although, Netbeans Java and Virtualbox etc are better off downloading from oracle IMO).\nOne of the advantages of running a linux operating system is that most programs (\"packages\") are installed through a package manager. This is similar to the \"app-store\" or \"google-apps\" and even more like \"homebrew\" if you are familiar with OSX.\nYou don't need to download the source of the source package to install a package (program) using Ubuntu.

We make use of the fact that test without arguments evaluates to false.\nsum () {\n    test $1 && echo $(( $1 + $(shift; sum $@) )) || echo 0\n}\n\n\nA: Try this:\nSUM () {\n [ $# -lt \"2\" ] && return 1\n for par in $@; do\n   local sum=`expr $sum + $par`\n done\n echo $sum\n return 0\n}\n\nSUM 3 4 5\nSUM 3 4 5 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5\n\nThis will output 12 and 30.\n$@ refers to parameter, $# returns the number of parameter, in this case 3 or 11.\nTested on linux redhat 4\n\nA: If you won't pass arguments with spaces:\nsum() {  \n[[ -n $2 ]] && echo $(( $(tr ' ' '+' <<<\"$@\") ))\n}\n\nEffect:\n$ sum 1 2 3\n6\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*<<<\"some string\" feeds in only \"some string\" as the input. Think of it as shorthand for echo \"some string\" |. It is called a Here String.\n\n*\"$@\" expands into all the positional parameters, separated by spaces.  It is equivalent to \"$1 $2 ...\".\n\n*Hence, tr ' ' '+' <<<\"$@\" outputs \"$1+$2+$3...\", which is evaluated by the outer $(( )).\n\n*[[ -n $2 ]] tests if the second parameter is non-empty. You could replace [[ -n $2 ]] && with [[ -z $2 ]] ||.\n\n\n\nAnother way:\nsum() {\n[[ -n $2 ]] && (IFS=+; echo $(( $* )))\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*$* is just like $@, except that the parameters are not separated by spaces, but by the first character of the Internal Field Separator (IFS).

Any idea?\n\nA: Simple port forwarding is not enough for FTP.\nFTP has a control connection on usually port 21, which you successfully mapped to port 8181. But to transfer files or directory listings FTP opens another connection. There are two ways to open this connection:\n\n\n*\n\n*Passive mode: This is what you use. In this case the FTP server allocates a random port on the server and tells the client IP and port using the response to the passive command. In you case this is \"227 Entering Passive Mode (10,0,2,15,224,245)\", which means the server waits at IP 10.0.2.15 port 57589. Since the client does not now that 10.0.2.15 is the server and since port 57589 on the server is not accessible from outside the connection will fail.\n\n*Active mode: Here the client opens a listener on a random port and informs the server about this port. The server will then try to connect from port 20 to this port. This might work if the Ubuntu 14.04 system inside the VirtualBox can access the host system (12.04). If this is possible depends on your setup.\n\n\nAnyway, FTP is an ugly protocol if port forwardings or firewalls are involved. I would recommend to use sftp instead, which is support by FileZilla too and which only needs a SSH server on the other side (which you probably already have because you forward to port 22).\n", "Q: Sound too low in Ubuntu I had bought some new components for my PC.

Started with a \"permission denied\", now it won't even run So I just ventured into the land of Ubuntu. It was a pleasant stroll until I came onto the chasm of users and permissions. \nI installed transmission-daemon. Everything looked nice and easy, but once a download gets going, it gives a shiny red \"Permission denied\" to my download path. So I started reading up on permissions. Learned how to use \"gksudo nautilus\" amongst other things. But things didn't clear up at all. The download folder had no owner as far as I could see when I worked through the files dialog. With \"gksudo nautilus\", it just crashed the window. I couldn't even see who owned it. Through the terminal it seemed all set like it should. Both owner and group set to debian-transmission.\nThen I stumbled on this topic: Transmission daemon: permission denied even if debian-transmission has root group and I thought: \"Hey, those are clear instructions I can follow! Let's do this!\".\nNow I'm stuck with a transmission that won't even start. It gives me a nice \"transmission-daemon start/running, process 29525\". But that's it. It stops right away and it's gone. No error or anything that my untrained eyes can work with.\nCan somebody help me with this? Some commands that can help me get further? Or should I just remove the whole thing and start over? Thanks in advance.\n//Edit\nI have followed muru's instructions and the daemon is back up and running but I am getting this error now: \nError: Unable to save resume file: Permission denied\n\nMy download folders look like this:\ndrwsrwxrwx 2 debian-transmission debian-transmission 4096 sep  8 22:35 completed\ndrwsrwxrwx 2 debian-transmission debian-transmission 4096 sep  8 22:35 incomplete\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 erik                erik                4096 sep  8 22:35 torrents\n\nAnd the info folder is this:\ndrwsrwxr-x 5 erik                debian-transmission 4096 sep 10 13:43 info\n\nRunning transmission-daemon --log-debug --foreground gives me Couldn't read \"/home/erik/.config/transmission-daemon/stats.json\": No such file or di\nrectory (utils.c:201)\nEven though it can't read the stats.json and I think it is somehow ignoring my settings file (whitelist for ip's isnt working). It does succesfully download to /home/erik/Downloads. Then I stop the service. And restart it with the command that I thought was correct sudo service transmission-daemon start and it starts making a mess again. So I don't know, is the fact that it's a service making a difference?\n\nA: The last command in that set: \nsudo chown your_user -R /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json \n\nsets your user as the owner of the settings file, and that file has read-permissions only for the owner by default. Transmission won't even be able to read it. Try: \nsudo service transmission-daemon stop \nchmod g+rw /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json \nsudo service transmission-daemon start\n\nSince the commands don't change the group ownership of that file, giving it group read/write permission should be enough to get Transmission to start.\nThere are other problems as well, so I suggest these modifications as well:\nchmod g+rw /var/lib/transmission-daemon/info/\nchmod u+s /your_path/progress /your_path/completed\n\nThis will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give the daemon the necessary write permissions on /var/lib/transmission-daemon/info/, where it stores the current status.\n\n*Ensure that files created in the download and temporary folders are owned by you, by making the folders setuid.\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem with transmission.\nI tried changing permission and all that.

Example: dd if=/dev/sdb of=/my/backup/disk.raw bs=1M\n\n*Make a copy of disk.raw and put it away, to have an untouched version if you have to revert.\n\n*Scan the disk.raw with testdisk first to see if you can restore the partitions.\n\n*If the method above did not succeded, grab as much data you can with photorec.\n\n*If nothing worked, try other recovery softwares, but work all the time on the image file! This is crucial to not make bigger damages.\n\n\nNote: About the usage of mentioned utilities please read their manuals first.\n\nA: Frantique's answer about dd-ing is a very good practice, but note that it will take a long time to dd an entire drive. If you don't have luck with photorec, I might suggest R-Linux. I have tried PhotoRec on a FAT32 drive and then it got 90% of my files back but R-Undelete (Win equivalent to R-Linux) got 100% of the files I was trying to get. In most cases, photorec will do a very good job, so I'd try both for sure, especially if you are getting mixed results.\n\nA: R-Linux(Recovery studio) is one of the best. I have used this tool many times before. I worked at a company where they used the commercial version, 9/10 times it recovers everything you want. Truly superb application. Saved mine, and friends behinds many times before. \n\nR-Linux is a free file recovery utility for the Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 FS\n  file system used in the Linux OS and several Unixes. R-Linux uses the\n  same InteligentScan technology as R-Studio, and flexible parameter\n  settings to provide the fastest and most reliable file recovery for\n  the Linux platform. However, unlike R-Studio, R-Linux cannot recover\n  data over network or reconstruct RAIDs, or provide object copy.\n\nFeatures (from their website):  \nR-Linux recover files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed by virus attack, power failure or system crash;\n\n*After the partition with the files was re-formatted, damaged, or deleted;\n\n*When the partition structure on a disk was changed or damaged. In this case, R-Linux can scan the disk trying to find previously existing partitions and restore files from found partitions.\n\n*From disks with bad sectors. In this case, R-Linux can first copy the entire disk or its part into an image file and then process the image file. This is especially useful when new bad sectors are constantly appearing on the disk, and remaining information must be immediately saved.\n\n\nR-Linux Advanced features: \n\n\n*\n\n*Standard \"Windows Explorer\" - style interface.\n\n*Host OS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux variant: Linux, kernel 2.6 and above\n\n*Windows variant: Win2000, XP, 2003, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8\n\n\n*Supported file systems: Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 FS (Linux) only.\n\n*Recognition and parsing Dynamic (Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Win7), Basic, GPT and BSD (UNIX) partitions layout schema and Apple partition map. Dynamic partitions over GPT are supported as well as dynamic partitions over MBR.\n\n*Creates image files for an entire hard drive, logical disk, or its part. Such image files can be processed like regular disks. Images can be either simple exact object copies (Plain images) compatible with the old versions of R-Linux, or compressed images that can be compressed, split into several parts, and password-protected. Such images are fully compatible with the images created by R-Drive Image, but incompatible with the old versions of R-Linux.\n\n*Recognizes localized names. \n\n*Recovered files can be saved on any (including network) disks accessible by the host operating system.\n\n\nExcerpt From Here: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/533967/36315\n", "Q: Byobu changing tabs When I'm sharing the same byobu session with multiple users, sometimes when I change the tab, the other user is automatically changed to my new tab, and sometimes he has to do it manually.

I have created an empty partition (currently unallocated) of size 100GB. Do I need separate swap areas for the 2 versions of Ubuntu?\n\nA: Just use the whole 100 GB for Ubuntu 14.04.\nYou do not need additional swap areas, because both versions will recognize the swap partition automatically (during installation) and use it.\nI'm not sure how it works when you suspend on (because it suspends into swap) and boot the other one. If you automatically boot the suspenden one, don't worry.\n", "Q: Unity launcher made with Alacarte iconless trying to create a launcher with a .png image file and main menu keeps on removing it. is .png not supported or do I need to edit the image first?\n\nA: What goes wrong\nI tried to create a launcher with Alacarte, with the same result. It turns out that when Alacarte creates a new launcher, it does not handle the icon's file extension correctly on custom icons. In the Icon= line of the launcher; it simply leaves out the extension.\nHow you can fix it\nIn your home directory, there is a folder ~/.local/share/applications (.local is invisible by default, press Ctrl + H to make it visible). That is the location where your launcher (file) is created.\n\n*\n\n*Open the folder\n\n*Look for a file named alacarte-made.desktop (if you created more than one, they will be numbered)\n\n*Open gedit, drag the file alacarte-made.desktop on to the open gedit window to open it.\n\n*Look for the line, starting with Icon=, replace the section after Icon= with the path to your icon, including the .png extension.\n\nNote\nYou might have to log out and back in to see the result.\n", "Q: using applications from one linux flavor to another on same pc I have zorin OS alongside ubuntu on my laptop. Virtualbox is installed on Zorin, I did it from terminal completely. Now, is there any way I can use that same Virtualbox on Ubuntu?\nThanks in advance :)\nps: Ubuntu 14.04 is my OS version.\nPlease keep your answers simple, I may have difficulty grasping them as I'm new to the world of computers.\n\nA: In general it is not a good idea to share application from one Linux flavor to the other. \nEven if both flavors were base on Ubuntu we can not rely on all shared libraries being installed, or have the version needed for a given application. It may work fine but in case there are issues we are faced with a confusing and hard to debug situation.\nIn addition, most applications heavily depend on libraries that had already been installed by the distribution. The benefit from sharing application binaries would be rather minimal.\nOnly rarely a self contained application binary compiled for the same architecture may successfully be shared (this may e.g. be the case for proprietary software or some games).\nEven sharing application's settings from our HOME may cause trouble if the distributions came with different application versions that may have a differing settings format.\nThe Virtual Box application should not be shared between distributions, as it depends on at least one kernel module loaded at boot. But of course you can easily share the virtual machines without issue, provided they are accesible from and registered in the corresponding Virtual Box installation.\n", "Q: How to run bootinfoscript from the GParted liveCD?

I just need to transfer my files. \nAny assistance would be appreciated.\n\nA: Instead of doing things the hard way you can just start a live Linux system from USB or CD/DVD and rescue your data with that. It would also make the diagnosis of the mount error(s) more convenient.\nIf you really want or need to use the rescue shell,\n\n\n*\n\n*look for a writeable file system like /run or /tmp (look at the mount options in the output of mount or the content of /proc/mounts for suitable ones) or\n\n*create a writeable tmpfs mount point yourself (mount -t tmpfs none /tmp).\n\n\nThere you can create directories you can later use as mount points for the file system(s) containing your data and those on your transfer medium.

CTRL+L isn't bound to any system function by default.

Imagine it like a powerful Movie Maker.\n", "Q: How to get default gateway with a dhcp I have ubuntu 12.04 and I have configured /etc/network/interfaces like this \nauto eth2\niface eth2 inet dhcp\n\nI also have \nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n        address 60.60.60.1 \n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        network 60.60.60.0\n        broadcast 60.60.60.255 \n\nand eth0 is similarly configured.\nWhen I do sudo route I don't see default gw.\nI just see 60.60.60.0 * 255.255.255.0 eth1\nand similarly \n10.0.0.0  *   255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth2\n\nSince the default gw is not present, I have got a proper 10.x.x.x IP address but no way to connect outside . How do I get the default gw automatically setup.\nI can add it using route add default gw and that works. But when I move locations, then I will have to keep on setting route add at every place manually\n\nA: I found the answer from this link https://serverfault.com/questions/527383/change-default-route-to-dhcp-interface-without-a-route-push\nI essentially set \"post-up route del default dev eth2\" and for any other interface on which I did not want the default gw (these were all addresses with static configuration).\nafter doing /etc/init.d/networking restart , ubuntu will automatically pick up the default gw to the dhcp server and that worked. It took me 3+ hours of searching to find this :-)\n\nA: Basically dhclient appears to only set the default gateway when routers are provided by the server and when a current default gateway is not set. so, as doon mentioned, you can add a \"route del default gw\" to your network configuration or you can do this manually (or in your own script) before dhclient is called.\n", "Q: How to save output to file that required root access I want to save output of command to a file that my current user do not have access to. But my user can have root access using sudo.\nI'm running for example:\nsudo crontab -l > /var/BackUp/crontab\n-bash: sudo: Permission denied\n\nBut I can run just sudo crontab -l\nSo I think sudo relevant only to crontab command and as user do not have access to /var/BackUp/crontab it gives such error.\nIs it possible to write output to a file that requires root access under current user?\n\nA: The redirection is not part of the sudo command. Depending on the operation you can do:\nsudo bash -c 'crontab -l >/var/backup/crontab'\n\nOr if the command doesn't need sudo:\ncrontab -l | sudo tee /var/backup/crontab\n\n\nA: Test this:\nsudo -i\ncrontab -l > /var/BackUp/crontab\n\n", "Q: is it safe to Install Ubuntu 14.04 packages on Kubuntu 14.04?

The underlying system is still the same.\nSo, as long as the computers are running the same version, it will work. (The third number on LTS releases just indicates an update milestone -- not an entirely different version)\nI should warn you, though, that installing packages this way does not guarantee that all of the dependencies of your packages will be installed.

I found this a useful feature in Ubuntu 12.04 as I have a lot of email folders and it is quicker to use the HUD than using the right click menu to navigate through all of my folders.  I simply needed to press 'Alt' to bring up the HUD and then type \"move to \" (actually you could shorten this further to \"mo \").\nI've recently upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 and this no longer seems to work.  I can still access the HUD and complete actions such as \"New message\" but I can't move messages to other folders.\nDoes anyone know why this is and if it is possible to get this functionality back?\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: Please check if any of your background aplication intercept alt as a hotkey.

When I booted my computer using the USB (my computer has no operating system installed by the way) I checked my installation media for errors and two were detected. My question is, how do I fix these errors?\n\nA: The short answer is, there is no way to fix this problem without rewriting the USB\nThere can be two reasons for this kind of errors:\nFirst: The downloaded ISO may be corrupted. This can happen if there is a glitch during download. First, determine if the ISO file you downloaded got corrupted during download. You do this by checking the MD5SUM of the ISO file. See Ubuntu Hashes for the correct MD5SUM and How To MD5SUM for how to check. \nIf the MD5SUM is wrong, download again and check again. Repeat until you get the correct MD5SUM. \nSecond: The USB drive may have some bad sectors. If this is the case, format the USB stick FAT32, and check for bad sectors again.

I've read about this problem with multiple distributions and kernels, and on occasion I read that it had been patched.  Early logs of the problem indicated that the kernel would not allocate enough power to deal with the new demands of the high speed USB, which might explain why it works in host mode (because the kernel didn't get a chance to limit the amount of power allocated), as well as on Windows, but not in Ubuntu.\nI have also read that, despite the insufficient power allocation, if you leave the USB stick plugged in for anywhere from 5-15 minutes, it will eventually get prioritized enough to be recognized and mounted.\nI'll follow up later with some links, very curious to see how this turns out. \nedit: Alternatively it could be a problem with FUSE.  Have you tried mounting it from the command line directly, rather than letting FUSE try and fail repeatedly to automount?\nedit 2: Here is a compilation of other instances of the same problem on varying kernels at varying times.  It seems to be a regression which keeps appearing in the later kernels just as it is resolved in the originally problematic ones.  In each case this was a blkid/udev failure/timeout, and in each case the culprit was a USB 3.0 device being handled by ehci/some variant thereof, and in each case the device is ultimately recognized after a long string of timeouts.  In all of the reported instances, forcefully mounting the device with sudo mount was successful, though this may be a fluke.\nWorth noting, by the way, is that a kernel downgrade will resolve the issue.  The latest release I saw mentioned as working smoothly was 3.10.7, and before that most people were only successful at <3.10.\nSo, without further adieu, your evidence:\nUbuntu 13.04 Does not recognize USB Drives\nCan't mount specific usb device after kernel upgrade\nUSB device constantly being reset\nCurrent Kernel causes blkid USB error\nSelective Blindness to Certain USB Devices\n\nA: It sounds like it may be a Linux driver problem, as your syslog does not report what mine does when I insert a USB disk.

Any suggestions? Why would packets from one box get routed differently than another coming from the same network?\n\nA: Given that this is a corporate situation, the most plausible culprit is the company firewall. Like in most corporate set-ups, the firewall rejects all outbound TCP port 25 connections, except those originating from designated machines. The Windows server probably is one of these, and the Ubuntu server isn't.\nTo find out whether this is the case, perform any of these diagnostics, in decreasing order of sensibility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask the network administrators. They know.\n\n*Run tcptraceroute mail.domain.com 25 from the Ubuntu server to find out which hop is rejecting the establishment of an SMTP connection.\n\n*Assign the IP address of the Windows server to the Ubuntu server. Pull out the network cable from the Windows server. Try telnet mail.domain.com 25 from the Ubuntu server. Better not tell the network administrators.\n\n\nFrom these diagnostics you will find out whether the TCP connection is blocked within the company, at the destination, or somewhere in between. I'd say the odds for these are 1G:10:1. In either case, you will need to talk to the network administrators to solve the issue, so you might as well take step 1 right away.\nNote that it makes no sense to do a traceroute when you can already ping a destination. The successful ping proves that the destination is live and reachable. Therefore all hops in between are reachable. No need to demonstrate that.\n", "Q: Can't run script with proz on Ubuntu I am trying to compile iOS code on Ubuntu.

By default Ubuntu when booting only mounts the partition on which it resides. I have several others, in cluding one which Ubuntu calls \"37 GB Volume\", alias /dev/sdb5 , on which Kubuntu and some data files reside. On the other systems on my computer, namely Windows XP and Kubuntu 12.04, all visible partitions are mounted on booting, and I believe I could achieve this by adding some code to a boot file; but I don't know the code and I don't know which file.\nA related problem which XP can handle is to get the Numlock to come on while booting so that the number characters in my password are read properly. \nTrivial problems, one may say, but I like to believe that anything Windows can do, Ubuntu can do better!\n\nA: You would add disks to your /etc/fstab file the same way as you would in Kubuntu, providing a line defining the device file, the file system, mount point, and other relevant options.  Kubuntu and Ubuntu are virtually the same with boot-time disk mounting, and use of the /etc/fstab file for defining at-boot mounting.\n", "Q: Cannot find location of permanent aliases. A couple of months ago, I made a few permanent aliases for my bash shell on Ubuntu 14.04. They are actively making my life easier, and I would like to add a couple more to the list, but I cannot find them. My .bashrc file does not actually contain any aliases, just the lines about running ~/.bash_aliases if it exists. And my ~/.bash_aliases file is completely blank. \n\nA: Run man bash to see what files bash may be looking at. \nThey include .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile,\nand, if you went privileged, /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile. \nOr you could pick a word or a sequence of words from one of your existing aliases\n(for example, qwerty aardvark42), and do\ngrep \"qwerty aardvark42\" ~/.*\ngrep \"qwerty aardvark42\" /etc/*\n\n\nA: Bash reads one of two sets of files depending on how it was invoked. In your case, since you are almost certainly running interactive, non login shells, the possible locations of your aliases are:\n~/.bashrc\n~/.bash_aliases\n/etc/bash.bashrc\n\nYour aliases should be in one of those files. For next time, you can add this function to your ~/.bashrc which lets you easily look through all the files where a variable or an alias or similar might be found. This will work for all types of (bash) shell:\ngrep_bash(){\n    grep -H \"$@\" ~/.bashrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile ~/bash.login ~/.bash_aliases \\\n        /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/* /etc/environment 2>/dev/null\n}\n\nYou can then search all those files for any given string by running\ngrep_bash foo\n\n\nA: The file /etc/skel/.bashrc contains the original .bashrc\n", "Q: Ubuntu on rMBP, bootloader location I'm getting ready to do a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 on my Macbook Pro.

I'd like to take that out of the equation, but I don't want to install rEFInd on my Mac's internal drive. I know there has to be a way do make this work. I have an Ubuntu LiveUSB (made with Unetbootin) that works without rEFInd and loads the same way I would boot into Bootcamp. I'm just not sure where I should install the bootloader (EFI partition, right at the root of the drive, or on my system root partition).\n\nA: Well, I feel like an idiot. I found the solution myself, I just installed rEFInd to the root of the SSD that Ubuntu resides on. Presto, it works. It worked for the USB 3.0 thumb drive I had as well. I'm not sure if it matters, but they are both formatted as GPT.\n", "Q: can't reattach to screen I've been having problems with screen (the terminal command).\nIf I type screen -ls it gives me:\n\nNo Sockets found in /var/run/screen/S-root.\n\nFor screen -r I get:\n\nThere is no screen to be resumed.\n\nWhat I did was to put @reboot screen -d -m /path/to/script in crontab, my shell script starts a java process.\nMy htop shows both the java and the screen command PID.\nAny ideas ?\nThanks in advance.\nP.S.: I use Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\n\nA: Perhaps screen is being created by a user other than root and is thus not in the /var/run/screen/S-root directory, and is instead in the /var/run/screen/S-username directory.\nYou can try to add the screen to your root crontab instead of a user's crontab.

It does not find a key which indeed exists in one of the files belonging to the indicator-datetime package. This command reinstalls the package:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall indicator-datetime\n\nAlso, it should be noted that in Ubuntu 14.04 it's unity-control-center to open System Settings from command line, not gnome-control-center. It should be possible to have both the packages installed, but based on my experience there is a risk for conflicts/confusion. So I would recommend that the gnome-control-center package is uninstalled.\n\nA: try using this cli\npkill -f indicator-datetime-service\n\nclock will appear directly.\ncredit : @Sneetsher \n\nA: try to type \"Time\" (without the quote) in the right top search box of the \"All Settings\"\nBut likley this will crash too.

There seems to be a way to get man pages to display in color (see here. It involves setting environment variables associated with less and adding these definitions to .bashrc. I tried doing the same in config.fish for the fish shell, but got no color output.\nHow to get color man pages in the fish shell?\n\nA: If you want these colors to be added only when viewing man pages, not for everything you view in less, you should set these variables in a wrapper function for man instead of putting them in your config.fish.\nThe whole process is to create a new file at ~/.config/fish/functions/man.fish, and inside it define a function man that sets the necessary environment variables, then calls the original man using command, passing in arguments using $argv.\nThis is my version of the wrapper function:\n~/.config/fish/functions/man.fish\nfunction man --description \"wrap the 'man' manual page opener to use color in formatting\"\n  # based on this group of settings and explanation for them:\n  # http://boredzo.org/blog/archives/2016-08-15/colorized-man-pages-understood-and-customized\n  # converted to Fish shell syntax thanks to this page:\n  # http://askubuntu.com/questions/522599/how-to-get-color-man-pages-under-fish-shell/650192\n\n  # start of bold:\n  set -x LESS_TERMCAP_md (set_color --bold red)\n  # end of all formatting:\n  set -x LESS_TERMCAP_me (set_color normal)\n\n  # start of standout (inverted colors):\n  #set -x LESS_TERMCAP_so (set_color --reverse)\n  # end of standout (inverted colors):\n  #set -x LESS_TERMCAP_se (set_color normal)\n  # (no change – I like the default)\n\n  # start of underline:\n  #set -x LESS_TERMCAP_us (set_color --underline)\n  # end of underline:\n  #set -x LESS_TERMCAP_ue (set_color normal)\n  # (no change – I like the default)\n\n  command man $argv\nend\n\n\nA: You can set the configuration by the following commands,  \nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_mb (printf \"\\033[01;31m\")  \nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_md (printf \"\\033[01;31m\")  \nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_me (printf \"\\033[0m\")  \nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_se (printf \"\\033[0m\")  \nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_so (printf \"\\033[01;44;33m\")  \nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_ue (printf \"\\033[0m\")  \nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_us (printf \"\\033[01;32m\")  \n\n\nA: Assuming you use less as your pager, put this in ~/.config/fish/config.fish:\nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_mb (printf \"\\e[01;31m\")\nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_md (printf \"\\e[01;31m\")\nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_me (printf \"\\e[0m\")\nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_se (printf \"\\e[0m\")\nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_so (printf \"\\e[01;44;33m\")\nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_ue (printf \"\\e[0m\")\nset -x LESS_TERMCAP_us (printf \"\\e[01;32m\")\n\nIf you see \\e[0m etc appearing when you view the man page, try adding this line as well:\nset -x LESS \"-R\"\n\n\nA: It's possible to use set_color instead of direct ANSI sequences.

It took along time of tinkering with 12.10 to get all of the features that came with the laptop oem so losing all that hard work would seem a waste.  But dont get me wrong i love a good problem solving challenge.\n\nA: You should definitely not use 12.10, as that is an unsupported release.  Using it would be bad for your security, and the security of others.\nYou could use 12.04, as despite being older that release has long term support and therefore will continue to get security updates for a long time.\nHowever, I would not recommend it for the reason you've given.  Having older hardware is generally not a good reason to use an older release.  Ubuntu itself is designed to be able to run on some pretty old hardware, and with each new version release, in theory, its hardware support should become better, not worse.\nIf your system specs struggle to run Ubuntu smoothly, it would be a better idea to run a more minimal version of Ubuntu (such as Xubuntu/Ubuntu with XFCE), or another distribution more tailored to older hardware or poorer specs, than to run an outdated version of Ubuntu.  If you run an outdated version of Ubuntu, you'll be frustrated by older versions of software, poorer support for newer peripherals, and more.\n\nA: If you want to check how well Ubuntu 14.04 performs on your laptop, try the live version.

After noticing that /dev/sda7 was 100% used, because Transmission told me there was no space to do what I wanted to do, I deleted a number of files from my downloads folder, and shut down my computer. The next time I started up, I entered my password at the login screen, as I always do, and instead of loading the desktop, only a blue screen loaded. It appeared as if more might eventually load -- maybe it just takes more time because of this directory that's 100% full. I wandered away for about 15 mins. while waiting for the desktop to load, and when I returned, the desktop was still plain blue, without any menu, dock, icons, or toolbar.\nInterestingly, I am able to login to the same partition, as a guest user.\nHow might I log into the admin. account, and force the desktop to load properly?\nFailing that, is there a way to sign in as guest, and then access and edit files found in /dev/sda7?\nThank you.\n\nA: \nHow might I log into the admin. account, and force the desktop to load properly?\n\nControl-alt-f1 (f2 through f6 will do the same; if you do not get a login there is also something wrong with your graphics card ;) ) will give you a text based login. Log in with your admin account and check the disks with\ndf -H\n\nIt will list all partitions and a percentages used. If any of the partitions are on 100% see if you can remove some stuff on the directory associated to that partition. \nThe are some options you can do after that:\nsudo reboot\n\nto reboot. Or ...\nexit\n\nto quit this sesssion and then control-alt-f7 gets you back to the desktop. \n\n\nand force the desktop to load properly?\n\nEasiest would be to reboot after you are done doing maintenance. This will reset everything and should allow you to login. If it does not it would also be adviced to login to console (ie. control-alt-f1) and check the log files in /var/log/ (needs admin access). A command to use on these text files is tail -n 100 {logfile} (shows the last 100 lines in a file). \n", "Q: How to make /bin/ps, called with aux as its argument, write to a file?

Many commands do not. But you can still make it do what you want.\nRedirecting with > or >>, as John1024 explains sends the standard output of your program to the file or device named to the right of >/>>. It sounds like this is what you want.\nHowever, if you want to write the output to a file and also see it yourself in the terminal, then you may wish to use the tee utility instead.\nps aux | tee file\nThis usage (| tee file) is like > file, but it shows you the ouput as well. If you want to see the output and append it to the file (rather than overwriting), use the -a flag:\nps aux | tee -a file\nThat usage (| tee -a file) corresponds to >> file.\nHow does tee work?\ntee duplicates its standard input, writing it both to the file (or list of files) given as its command-line arguments, and to standard output.\nOrdinarily--that is, when a program or command is run in the simplest way--its standard input is received from the user. It's what the user types as the program runs.\nBut the pipe operator, |, connects the standard output of the command to the left of it, to the standard input of the command to the right of it. In the examples above, this causes ps aux to send its output to the input of tee instead of to the terminal (and tee to receive its input from the output of ps aux, instead of from the terminal).\ntee then writes what it's received both to file and to the terminal.\nBy the way, one common use of pipes is when you anticipate the output of a command will be long, and you want to be able to navigate up and down in it. You can then pipe its output to less. For example: dmesg | less.\nRedirecting/piping error output too.\nThe redirection and piping solutions discussed above and in John1024's answer change where standard output goes, but they leave standard error alone. That is, most error messages (and some other messages, depending on the program) are unaffected--even in ps aux > file, errors will appear on the screen and not in file.\nThis is usually what you want. And especially in the case of ps aux, it's unlikely you want error messages in your output file--errors are unexpected, and you'd probably want to see them right away. An error would likely render the file you're trying to make unsuitable for your task, anyway, assuming your goal is to produce a table of running processes and their characteristics.\nHowever, if you do want error output to be treated just the same as regular output, you can use the &-suffixed version of the redirection and piping operators:\n\n*\n\n*>& (or &>) in place of >: ps aux >& file or ps aux &> file\n\n*&>> (not >>&) in place of >>: ps aux &>> file.\n\n*|& (not &|) in place of |: ps aux |& tee file, or ps aux |& tee -a file to append.\nbash, the default interactive shell in Ubuntu, supports the &ed operators. This is the shell you're using unless you've deliberately switched to another one, so for interactive use (and for scripts where you know they'll be run with bash), you can definitely feel free to use it.\nRedirecting/piping error output too, on shells that don't have the &ed operators.\nSome shells (like dash, which provides sh on Ubuntu) do not support them. In that case you'd get errors like:\n\n*\n\n*dash: 2: Syntax error: Bad fd number (when trying to use >& — in contrast, &> and &>>, when unsupported, get interpreted as & > and & >>, which do something different)\n\n*dash: 1: Syntax error: \"&\" unexpected (when trying to use |&)\n\nWhen working in a shell where >&, >>&, and |& are unsupported, you can send both standard output and standard error through a redirection or pipe in the traditional way, by specifying separately that standard error is first to be redirected to standard output.\nThis is achieved with 2>&1. (1 is the file descriptor for standard output, and 2 is the file descriptor for standard error.)\nFor a redirection (i.e., when you'd like to be able to use >& or >>&), put 2>&1 at the very end:\nps aux > file 2>&1\nps aux >> file 2>&1\nFor a pipe (i.e., when you'd like to be able to use |&), put 2>&1 right before the | pipe:\nps aux 2>&1 | tee file\nps aux 2>&1 | tee -a file\n\nA: With minimally touching JavaScript (from my side), I'd suggest this:\nRun bash instead of ps - do all the searches and checks for bash and ps, and start the process for bash with arguments: -c, ps.path + ' aux > '+ filePathToOutputTo.\nThe overall command here should look like:\n/bin/bash -c \"/bin/ps aux > /path/to/output/file\"\n\n\nA: Unix programs typically write their output to \"standard out\", also known as stdout.  Using the shell feature of redirection, stdout can be sent to a file instead of the terminal.  To send it to a file name file, use:\nps aux >file\n\nThe symbol > indicates redirection and should be followed by a file name.  If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.  If you want to append to the existing file instead, use the symbol >> as in:\nps aux >>file\n\nBy the way, a very common use for redirection is to silence a verbose command.  To do this, one can redirect its output to the file /dev/null.  This is a special file which throws away any input that you send to it.\nWorking with scripts\nRedirection can be used within a script:\n#!/bin/sh\nps aux >file\n\nAlternatively, redirection can be applied to the output of a script as a whole:\nmyscript >file\n\nYou can also pass the file name in as an argument.  Suppose that myscript consists of:\n#!/bin/sh\nps aux >\"$1\"\n\n($1 is script-ese for the first argument on the command-line.) Then you can run:\nmyscript somefile\n\nand the ps aux command will be redirected to somefile.\n", "Q: How to force 'top' to show human readable values for %MEM RES and VIRT How can I configure 'top' to show all values in human readable format instead of long numerics.

Don't use WAM on .zip files because they are already compressed. Also you didn't put \"\" around the \"yes\" for WAM. \nWhen using WAM you must provide a compression level. For example:\n+wam=\"yes\" +wamcompression=\"3\" \n\nA higher number means higher compression, but you will need a system powerful to implement the compression so don't pick a really big number. 0 means no compression.\n\"error014291\" means you didn't provide your password.

In my combined NAS and Media Center solution, I have currently XBMC installed on a Ubuntu desktop 12.04. While generally functional, XBMC sometimes crashes and I can't but help that Ubuntu Desktop is overkill in this situation. Basically, the only graphical interface I need is XBMC, the rest (AFP, Time Machine setup, management in general etc) I administer through ssh or sometimes webmin. So my question is, as the title suggest:\nWhat would be the optimal Ubuntu version for a NAS with XBMC? (My interpretation of 'optimal': I want the video rendering to be as good as possible, and I want the system to be as stable as possible.)\nHardware: Intel Atom D525 CPU & NVIDIA ION 512MB DDR3 GPU.\n\nA: Measured by what we can do with it xbmc has surprisingly low demands on hardware. The minimum requirements to run xbmc are:\n\n\n*\n\n*x86 processor from Pentium 4 or newer, 256 Mb RAM, Radeon HD4300, Intel GMA 950, GeFarce 6 or better.\n\n\nAll other OS additions, and the desktop will add to that. Therefore a full blown Unity desktop as it comes with Ubuntu 14.04 appears not only overkill but it may also considerably reduce performance on a low-end system. Still, even Ubuntu can be configured to run with the quite lean gnome-session-flashback desktop.\nIn case we do not need any graphical desktop on our media center we may consider to install xbmc on Ubuntu Server but then we may have to manually add some applications we may need.\nTherefore a more user-friendly approach may be to choose a flavour with a desktop as lean as possible, and with few additional applications only (e.g. Lubuntu or Xubuntu). This also gives us the advantage to maintain our system from a graphical desktop.\nWe can configure xbmc to run an xbmc-standalone session to boot our PC directly to xbmc without loading the desktop environment. This alone may give us a best performance irrespect of which Ubuntu flavour we had used as a base.\nWe should also mention XBMCbuntu an inofficial derivative of Ubuntu maintained by the xbmc team and tailored to run xmbc. This derivative hovewer is not supported here on Ask Ubntu.\n", "Q: Undo apt-get remove --purge I wanted a fresh install of Python and ran sudo apt-get remove --purge python. Apparently it has killed almost everything I had installed in my system.\nLooking at the history.log I guess I could manually install the packages again, but there are hundreds of them, I can't just copy paste.\nIronically, python is still installed. Could I perform some replace regex with it so I can fix this mess? Or with bash.\n\nA: First I ran sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop as I was told in the comments, then I copied the part of /var/log/apt/history.log concerning the purge action, and ran on it the following python script I made.

Because you're seeing only 28 charms this implies the import was not performed correctly, as it says in the README you can expect ~1050 charms in the DB and it might take more than 2 hours.

After installing that bundled OS it shows that user but unable to login, giving the password it again returns to the login screen.\nCan someone let me know correct way of adding a user in that image and bundle it.\n\nA: Whatever user you created at the time of creating the image, the Ubuntu installer apparently ignored it, because it didn't create a /home directory for that user. So apparently you have just one regular user on that system, and that is the user you created when you were installing the customized Ubuntu OS and you also should be able to login without a password as a guest user.\nWhile installing the customized OS, the Ubuntu installer asked you to type your user name so that it could create a /home directory for a new user with that user name. Then it asked you to type a password for that user or else if you left the password field blank you can login without a password just by pressing the Enter key.\nIf for some reason, the Ubuntu login screen does not accept your password for the new user that you created in the Ubuntu installer, then you can change the password for that user from an Ubuntu live DVD or live USB. The login password is normally the same (by default) as the administrative password which is used to run sudo commands in Ubuntu.

I removed the remmina.pref file, but without luck. What Remmina asks for is accepting the cert and fingerprint first time it connects to a remote agent. I assume it then stores that info, although there is nothing that can be found in directory ~/.remmina other than the pref file. I want to remove any old traces of the Active Directory cert, so it will ask me for the newest certificate and generate me a new fingerprint.\n\nA: Found the solution in the /home/user directory .freerdp. It has a known_hosts file which stores the fingerprint. After deleting the entry of the host's IP, Remmina will regenerate a new cert when connecting.\nAnother solution can be to RDP with the host's FQDN.\n", "Q: Why do ext2 and successors not need defragmentation? The ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem family does not need defragmentation.\nWhat underlying design help this filesystem in not getting fragmented?\n\nA: In ext3 file system, there is a block allocator for the disk for each block, and so, it is quite possible that fragmentation can occur.\nHowever, in ext4 file system there is a multi-block allocator which can delay the writing of blocks to disk, so that it can property allocate several blocks at a time in a single chunk of disk to allow for a contiguous write - and so, it is less likely that fragmentation can occur (it is still possible, just less likely)\n\nA: At least for Ext2 (and Ext3 I think, though I am less sure), there is nothing in the on-disk format/structure that would prevent defragmentation.\nThe lack of need for defragmentation is going reside at the implementation level, which will vary from OS to OS.  That is, depending upon the implementation, a file in Ext2 may or may not be fragmented.\nIf fragmentation is avoided, that will likely be due to delayed allocation of physical blocks.  That is, at some level of the implementation, the file system will cache the data (and access it via logical block number) until such time as it is written/committed to disk.  When the data is finally written to disk, physical blocks must be allocated.  The allocation algorithm may (or may not) allocate a number of contiguous available physical blocks for the data.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: One way in which the ext4 file system keeps fragmentation in-check, is with the process of delayed allocation (ext4's default allocation mode).\n\nDelayed allocation works by deferring the mapping of newly-written file data blocks to disk blocks in the filesystem until writeback time.\n\nThis works by allocating most of the blocks for a file at the same time, when the total number of blocks (or at least a ballpark) in each file is known.  This allows the block allocator (the mballoc mentioned in MMK's answer) to do a better job of finding an appropriately-sized area of free space to put the file.\n", "Q: When I open a terminal and type set I get a strange output I opened a terminal on the desktop in Xubuntu and typed \nset\nand then a new line.

I know, it's a proprietary program, but the problem is more general and affect Wine too. Please do not stop reading. \nBoth machines have a spanish keyboard working well most of the time (showing sometime a known bug but I think it's unrelated). The problem is that on one of them there is a set of program running under Crossover Wine affected by a bug that makes the dead keys not working on some program, notably MS Office Word (there is also another bug for another issue but it seems it is the same  problem). \nDisabling IBus in Language Support -> Change Keyboard input method and unsetting XMODIFIERS works on one machine but not on the other (!).  \nSo it must be some strange setting doing the difference...\nThe question\nIs it possible to dump all the gsetting/dconf/whatever configuration database(2) in a readable file so that I can check differences with diff -u? \nI know that \ngsettings list-recursively org.freedesktop.ibus.general\n\nworks, but I am quite puzzled that \ngsettings list-recursively org.freedesktop\n\ngives the error \nNo such schema 'org.freedesktop'\n\n...so it seems that I can't dump all of the registry in one go.

Both OS were installed on UEFI mode and are 64 bits. Ubuntu 14 was installed using the upgrade option from Ubuntu 13.10. After the upgrade grub was broken and I couldn't boot anymore. I managed to get Windows to boot using the Repair Disc, but I can't get Ubuntu to boot using GRUB.\nThe first thing I tried then was using boot-repair, as I always did. But, somehow, with Ubuntu 14, boot-repair returns \"An error has ocurred\" and fails.\nI have the boot-repair log at http://paste.ubuntu.com/8319294/\nI hope this helps solving my problem as Ubuntu is my main system.\nEDIT: \nI have a separate EFI partition on my system.\nBoot-repair gives an error \"Wrong GRUB version detected.

Only Windows is booting, GRUB is being ignored.\nEDIT:\nAfter some time trying to figure out why GRUB is being ignored I found out something interesting. It seems my computer is looking for the Windows Boot Loader at \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi, no matter how I set the boot options using efibootmgr. Because of that, the only way I could consistently boot using GRUB was moving the Windows Boot Manager to another folder, but this breaks my GRUB configuration, making it impossible to boot Windows. It looks like a problem related to Intel's firmware, as you can see here. Now I'm stuck with no idea how to solve the problem.\n\nA: @oldfred Your links were very useful. I've opted for using the overwrite strategy from Dual boot Win 8 / Ubuntu loads only Win (plan B).

System boots up very fast, but Unity UI performance slowed to 'molasses': windows fade in and out really slow and when I play video in vlc player from my usb drive, its really choppy.  Video played smooth and other wise just fine on the HDD.\nI've re-installed 14.04 several times on the SSD and still get the sluggish responsiveness from the UI.  I'm going to try a my other SSDs to see if its the drive, but am wondering if anyone has any suggestions (like increasing swap size, etc.).  Was really surprised to see performance get worse with an SSD!\nUpdate #1\n\n\n*\n  \n*/tmp and /var are both on /dev/sda1\n  \n*both drives have a 2Gb swap\n  \n*sudo hdparm -t /dev/sda test: SSD avg (n=5) = 111.88, HDD avg (n=5) = 39.41 Mb/sec\n  \n*variance was small between samples, so the SSD is roughly 3X faster the the HDD\n  \n*\"latest\" firmware on SSD is dated 2013-07-08\n\n\nHDD is a 60Gb 5400rmp Seagate Momentus.  Although SSD is pretty slow relative to the HDD, it is still roughly 3X faster.  So hardware alone is probably not the reason the SSD is slower.\nNext thing to try are the other optimizations.  I'm not very optimistic, but hope I'm wrong.\nUpdate #2\nCloned the Adata SSD to my SanDisk Extreme and saw the same sluggish performance. Next, I did these 9 optimizations:\n\n\n*Made sure I installed all the latest updates.\n\n*Installed non-free drivers using sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree\n\n*BIOS and UEFI: set it to AHCI - No option in my BIOS to do this, so had to skip\n\n*Check for updated firmware - Adata firmware update tool doesn't work on Windows 7, so I'm stuck with firmware that came with the drive.  Lesson: Avoid Adata drives if you're running Linux.\n\n*Swap: Install sets to 2Gb.  Recommendation was 7% over-provisioning which would have been 9Gb for the 128Gb drive.  Tried 2, 9 and 0 swap, but didn't see any difference in performance.\n\n*Ext 4 was set up by default: verified in gparted\n\n*Disabled the write action \"access time stamp\" by editing: /etc/fstab\n\n*Enabled automatic TRIM by editing: /etc/rc.local\n\n*Ran a manual trim executing: sudo fstrim -v /\n\n*Set vm.swappiness=1 in /etc/sysctl.conf\nreference:  https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/ssd\nVideo was still choppy.\n@Ubuntu Fanatic:  Yes, the laptop is older HW (purchased 2006) running on the older SATA bus and appears to be performing at expected speed.  Other articles suggest removing the swap, so I booted to a gparted Live disk and removed the swap that the Ubuntu installer created (2Gb).  Didn't expect to see a performance improvement and didn't, but should improve life of the drive.\n@Mike Jr/Eric C.: I have integrated graphics on this ancient laptop.  I'll try XUbuntu next, but for now, going back to the little spinner which was working just fine.\n\nA: Sounds like the connection might be maxing it out. \nYou say it's an older computer so it likely has IDE or sata 1 which means 150 MBs is the best you could expect mathematically. Remember sata 1 is 1.5GBs raw, but only 150mbs usable, sata 2 is 3GBs raw 300mbs usable, and sata 3 is 6GBs raw 600MBs usable. \nReal world you're exactly where you should be for the kind of connection I assume you're using.\nAlso you're using swap on the hard drive which means any data that gets saved there will reduce your system performance! Loose the hard drive swap, or at least disable it at startup.\n\nA: I run Ubuntu inside Virtualbox which has its own set of performance concerns.  You are running native so I would suggest looking at these two steps from this post http://www.binarytides.com/better-xubuntu-14-04/\n\n\n  \n*Speed up the user interface\n  \n  \n  Create a file named .gtkrc-2.0 in your home directory and paste in the\n  following lines\ngtk-menu-popup-delay = 0 \ngtk-menu-popdown-delay = 0 \ngtk-menu-bar-popup-delay = 0 \ngtk-enable-animations = 0 \ngtk-timeout-expand = 0\ngtk-timeout-initial = 0\ngtk-timeout-repeat = 0\n\nSave the file, close it, logout and login back. Now all gui elements\n  like menus, buttons should be faster.\nTo speed up Xubuntu further, disable the compositor from \"All Settings >\n  Window Manager Tweaks > Compositor Tab\". It will save system resources from being spend on fancy desktop effects.\n\n  \n*Install additional drivers (\"That SSD likely has a proprietary driver\")\n  \n  \n  If you have hardware components for which proprietary drivers are\n  available, then you can install them to get the best performance. For\n  example Nvidia graphics card work best with the proprietory drivers\n  from nvidia instead of the free and open source nouveau drivers.\nFor Nvidia drivers follow this article Install the latest Nvidia\n  drivers on Xubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr\nFor more hardware units like wireless cards, check the Additional\n  Drivers section. Click the menu on top left, go to All Settings >\n  Additional Drivers and install the ones that you need.\n\n", "Q: Permission denied: '/var/lib/partman/stopfifo' when trying to install 14.04 as dual boot with Windows 8 I am trying to install UBUNTU 14.0.4.1 LTS along with Windows 8.

They use a patch that comes together with nvidia driver package and I suspect this to be the reason for your problems. So, upgrade, restart, and after restart press Ctrl+Alt+F1, input username and password and reinstall your nvidia drivers. \nJust don't forget to keep in mind the name for your nvidia drivers - eg: nvidia-331 or similar. To manually install drivers you can run this command: \n     sudo apt-get install nvidia-xxx\n\nwhere xxx is the number for your driver package. Use remove instead of install to manually remove drivers first.\nOnce you get to the Ubuntu login sign, press together Ctrl+Alt+F1 which will get you to the console. Input your username and password, and run this command: \n     sudo nvidia-xconfig \n\nThis will configure your system with your newly installed nvidia drivers. Reboot and that should do it. \nIf it still won't work after reboot, you need to run yet another command after you press again Ctrl+Alt+F1 key combination, and this new command is: \n    sudo chmod -R ug+rwx /home/[username] \n\nReplace [username] with your username without the brackets. This way you claim full permission for your user home folder. Hope either way will be of help.\n", "Q: \"Gave Up waiting for root device. Alert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/ does not exist.

I had to do two things to fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Fast Boot. Doing this from the BIOS was not sufficient (try rebooting and looking again - it kept going back to enabled).

My BIOS warned me that everything would be lost, and luckily it wasn't.\n\n\nThe next time I booted from my thumbdrive I could see my ssd disk (at /dev/nvme01n1). I then installed boot-repair, ran it and rebooted. Voila.\n\nA: I came cross the same issue after repairing partition table. The message was actually straightforward. Checked the directory /dev/disk/by-uuid/, the uuid in the message did miss. Instead, there was another uuid that linked to the partion (../../sda5 for mine) what was expected the right partition.\nEventually I solved the problem simply: edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg, replace the wrong uuid with the right one.\n\nA: Since the root filesystem is detected after some time, you can add a rootdelay or a rootwait. From the kernel documentation:\nrootdelay=  [KNL] Delay (in seconds) to pause before attempting to\n        mount the root filesystem\n...\nrootwait    [KNL] Wait (indefinitely) for root device to show up.\n        Useful for devices that are detected asynchronously\n        (e.g. USB and MMC devices).\n\nTo set either, edit /etc/default/grub, and change the value of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX. Use your preferred editor, like nano or gedit, with sudo or gksudo as needed: \nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nAdd rootdelay=10 inside the quotes. If you'd rather not edit manually, then run this command:\nsudo sed -i.bak 's/^GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"/& rootdelay=10 /' /etc/default/grub\n\nThen run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis will tell the kernel to wait 10 seconds before proceeding to mount the root filesystem.\nTo see if this change was applied, run\ngrep rootdelay /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nIf some output was shown, then it was applied. Now reboot.\nIf it still threw an error, press CtrlAltDel to reboot, wait for the GRUB OS selection menu to show up and press e. Edit the value of rootdelay, and increase it. Press F10 to boot. Repeat.\nIf it booted correctly, try the above process, and decrease the value. \n\nA: I had Windows 7 64 bit installed on my laptop. Then installed ubuntu 14.04 from a thumb drive, so that I could dual boot windows and ubuntu. I then got the \"gave up waiting for root device\" error error.\nTo fix it I tried many things suggested in forums: reinstalling ubuntu, reinstalling and updating grub, boot-repair, update-initramfs, and nothing worked. The only thing that fixed it was installing from a CD. The CD installation worked perfectly and no errors. \n\nA: I had the same issue,\nlink to my question\nThe issue is with creation of initramfs, after doing a\nmake oldconfig\n\nand choosing default for new options, make sure the ENOUGH diskspace is available for the image to be created. in my case the image created was not correct and hence it was failing to mount the image at boot time.\n\nwhen compared; the image size was quite less than the existing image of lower version, so I added another disk with more than sufficient size and then\nmake bzImage\n\nmake modules\n\nmake modules_install\n\nmake install\n\nstarts working like a charm. I wonder why the image creation got completed earlier and resulted in corrupt image (with less size) without throwing any error [every single time]\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem after installing Xubuntu 14.04 32bit. Just try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*after the boot ends with the UUID message and (initramfs) just type exit or exec startx and it will get you into GUI\n\n*edit as root /etc/default/grub\n\n*find #GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true , delete # and save it\n\n*in terminal run: sudo update-grub and sudo reboot\nAnd after this it should work.\n", "Q: How do I report an Ubuntu Software Center \"Listing\" problem?

Remember that NetworkManager \n    controls the default route, so because the interface is ignored, \n    NetworkManager may assign the default route to some other interface.  \n    When the option is missing, false value is taken as default.\n\nSo, you can add to /etc/network/interfaces something like:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet manual\n\nAdd it to the list of unmanaged devices\nFrom the manpage:\n[keyfile]\nThis section contains keyfile-specific options and thus only has effect\nwhen using keyfile plugin.\n...\nunmanaged-devices=mac:<hwaddr>;mac:<hwaddr>;...\n    Set devices that should be ignored by NetworkManager when using \n    the keyfile plugin. Devices are specified in the following format: \n    \"mac:<hwaddr>\", where <hwaddr> is MAC address of the device to be \n    ignored, in hex-digits-and-colons notation. Multiple entries are \n    separated by a semicolon. No spaces are allowed in the value.\n    Example:\n    unmanaged-devices=mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1E:65:30:D1:C4\n\nFirst look up the MAC address:\nifconfig wlan0 | grep -i HWaddr\n\nHere, you'd edit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. Under a [keyfile] section (add one if it doesn't exist), add:\nunmanaged-devices=mac:some-mac-address\n\n\nThe first method depends on the ifupdown plugin being used, and the second depends on the keyfile plugin being used. By default, both are used, and managed is false.\nYou need to restart Network Manager for changes to the configuration file to take effect (thanks, @rubo77):\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu upgrades break ethernet connection After performing updates on my newly installed Ubuntu 14.04 on Lenovo T440p, the ethernet connection stops working.

However, after supposedly installing Ubuntu, I wanted both Ubuntu and Windows 8 to appear on the screen when booting (so I could choose which one I wanted to work with), and that's when the problem appeared... in the terminal, I followed a tutorial that could make the dual boot work (I don't remember what I wrote) and, all of a sudden, all of my partitions were gone. I initiated the computer again and it would go straight to the BIOS. Then, after several tries, I somehow installed Ubuntu and have been working on it since. However, I know that all of my partitions are messed up and now that I need both Windows and Ubuntu on my pc, I want to delete the current Ubuntu that I have and start working on the computer like it didn't have any operative systems (install both Windows and Ubuntu from scratch). I really appreciate any help that you can give.\nI attached a print screen of gparted (http://i.imgur.com/KG9kqBw.png?1), which shows all of the partitions on the computer.\n\nA: \nThen, after several tries, I somehow installed Ubuntu and have been working on it since.\n\nThat was a terribly bad idea. You should never, ever install a new OS on top of an old one you are trying to rescue.\nMoreover... your screenshot shows that you managed to fill up ~600GB of stuff on the hard drive, which makes any recovery impossible.\n\nI want to delete the current Ubuntu that I have and start working on the computer like it didn't have any operative systems (install both Windows and Ubuntu from scratch).\n\nMmm ok, this is kind of the opposite of what the title would suggest. If you don't want to recover stuff, but instead you want to completely erase the data on the disk, it's quite easy. You have two ways.\nWARNING: Everything written in the following part of my answer will delete or at least seriously damage the contents of your hard drive. Don't use the following commands if you care about the data contained there. I am not kidding.\n\nHaving said that, let's start:\nThe basic way\nIf you want your disk to \"seem\" empty, you can delete the partition table. For doing so, you can just blank some blocks at the beginning of your disk:\n# DANGEROUS COMMAND, BE CAREFUL\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1024 count=10\n\nI've put up some numbers. Probably just one or two blocks could be ok, but just in case...\nAs said before, this will blank the partition table. This allows to see the disk as empty, however it doesn't give you a guarantee on security. What I mean is that people will still be able to recover most of your files by using specialized computer forensics software such as testdisk, photorec, foremost or the Autopsy Browser.\nThe long, long way\nAnother option is to completely wipe every single bit on your hard disk. This can be done by not limiting dd. It's also useful to try a bigger block size to save a bit of time.\n# EXTREMELY DANGEROUS COMMAND, BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=8192\n\nThis could take up to some hour without giving you any feedback.\nFinal remarks\nIt is your responsibility to make backups of data you need. You asked for ways to wipe your disk and I gave them, but keep in mind that taking care of your data is your duty.\n\nA: To reinstall Windows and Ubuntu after that, you need to create an NTFS partition for Windows and an ext4 partition for Ubuntu. You then need to install Windows first. If you install Windows last, you will be unable to reach GRUB2 on boot.\n", "Q: lubuntu can't start softwares I've just downloaded Lubuntu 14.04 and each software I download, I don't know how to open it. For example I just downloaded UNetbootin, but when I double click on it, it won't start. Same for others like Wine. I downloaded UNetbootin from the official site and the Linux version. What should I do? Thank you.\n\nA: The problem is probably (my guess) that you did not download the correct file. But let's do this step by step. Don't worry, it's not as much as it looks like. Note that I'm using the german translation and translated them myself back to english to give the following instructions:\nInstalling unetbootin (or other applications) in lubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the start button to show the start menu.\n\n*Click on \"System tools\" and then \"Lubuntu Software Center\".\nNote: To create a shortcut to the software center on the desktop, make a right click on it's icon and click on \"Add to desktop\".\n\n*In the Software Center, click on All.\n\n*Type \"unetbootin\" to find it, double click on it.\n\n*Click on the bottom right on \"Add to ...\".\n\n*Click at the top on the button on the right with the question mark.\n\n*Review what will be installed and click on \"Install Packages\"\nInstall applications from downloaded files\nIn case you want or have to install from a downloaded file, you should always choose a linux download, while you should always prefer .deb files. Those are a bit like the setup files on windows.\nTo install those, yust make a double click on it. A windows will appear, providing a button named \"Install Package\". Click it, enter your password and the application will be installed. When it's finished successfully, you can start it from the start menu. Remember that you can create shortcuts to applications, it's really useful.\nThe difference\nYou may wonder what the difference between downloading from the website and using the software center is. Well, the official website of an application probably offers the newest version earlier. On the other hand, the versions from the software center are more likely to work stable on your system. Also it's nice to have a software center, right?\n\nA: Im not familiar with Lubuntu but it seems very similar to Ubuntu and you say you double click it as if its a windows executable. Just in case that is the case, know that there are no executables in Linux and you need to go into the terminal and enter chmod +x /path/to/file.run to run .run files.\nEdit: In response to your last comment Im not sure what the problem is because if your sure you entered the path of the file write it shouldnt return that error, what path did you enter?\n", "Q: Can't boot to windows after removing ubuntu If this is not the right place, please tell me where to ask this.\nI tried to remove ubuntu from windows, and I deleted the partitions. after starting up windows, I executed in command line: bootrec /fixmbr and bootrec /fixboot, and expected to start windows normally, I didn't.

here:\nhttps://lwn.net/Articles/522262/\nFor faster synchronization, many structures in the kernel are \"RCU\", or read-copy-update.  Many threads can read simultaneously without blocking, and threads that want to alter the structure can do so quickly by copying the relevant data to a new location and changing the reference (\"removal\").  However, the old data must live for some time longer so that reading threads can finish their work.  When the old data no longer has readers working on it, it can finally be deleted (\"reclamation\").\nThe rcuos, rcuob threads are there to handle the reclamation part of this process.  It used to be handled as part of software IRQ, which meant it could take processor power away from critical user processes at inopportune times.  By moving this to a bunch of dedicated rcu** threads, the system can be tuned to make this reclamation process less intrusive.\nReducing OS jitter is not the purpose of these threads, though it may be the main reason they exist.\n\nA: According to the ubuntuforums they are coming from the \"Reduce OS Jitter\" which is turned on by the following kernel flags\nCONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU\nCONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_ALL\nCONFIG_RCU_STALL_COMMON\nCONFIG_RCU_USER_QS\n\nSince 13.10 (Saucy) they are enabled by default.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2225218\n\n*https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-per-CPU-kthreads.txt\n", "Q: 'sudo lshw' yielding unexpected output I'm running ChrUbuntu 14.04 LTS on my Asus M004U Chromebox, and I wanted to find out information about the disks connected. \nI tried sudo lshw, but got command not found.

I am using a Windows 7 (64 bit) guest with an Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) host.  I just recently upgraded to Virtualbox 4.3.16 r95972, although this problem appeared before upgrade--at the very least in the previous version.  The Virtualbox extension pack is the latest edition and guest additions is installed on the guest OS.\nMy problem is that when I put the guest OS into full-screen mode, the Ubuntu system bar remains on top, regardless of where the mouse focus is.  There is also a unity-style shadow behind where the Virtualbox mini menu is hiding in the bottom center.\n\nI can't remember exactly when this started happening unfortunately.\nI also noticed that on the unity sidebar context menu for Virtualbox, there is now a 3rd item called Qt-subapplication, which I suspect is the Virtualbox mini-menu, and unity treating it as a separate window is why it has the shadow, and potentially why the guest OS window can't capture the fullscreen.\n\nI'm guessing this might be a bug of some sort, but, if it is, I suspect it's a bug in the form of some cool new feature of unity that Canonical is unwilling to change, such that it falls to the Virtualbox developers to comply with the new feature.  As such, I don't see it being fixed anytime soon, so my question would be about possible workarounds.\nSo, anybody have any ideas about how to keep unity from capturing the mini-menu as a separate window and preventing the guest OS from capturing fullscreen?\nThanks!\n\nA: Same here. The problem is that the Qt-subapplication (vbox menu) is always having the focus rather than the main vbox window. That causes Unity system bars to be on top. You can just close the Qt-subapplication and vbox will be the top window again. The easiest way to get the vbox menu back again when needed is hitting two times Right-Ctrl+F to leave and reenter full screen mode. These are just workarounds. Hope that vbox will fix it with next release.\n", "Q: Dell Vostro 14 3446: Trackpad detected as Mouse (or something else) For some reason, my trackpad is being detected as mouse in all the distro that I tried (Ubuntu 14.04, Linux Mint 17, Crunchbang, Salix) except Ubuntu 12.04.

I am doing a dd on two identical drives with this command:\n dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4096\n\nBoth hard drives are the exact same model number, and both have 1TB of storage space. /dev/sda  uses a blocksize of 4096. /dev/sda is a local drive and /dev/sdb is a remote caddy. I might be able to use the following protocols:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB2.0 HighSpeed (Currently the plan)\n\n*Gigabit Over-The-Network clone (Really do not want to even try this)\n\n*USB3.0 (If I find my other drive caddy)\n\n*eSATA (If I find/buy a cable)\n\n*SATA (If I find/buy a cable, gotta love laptop CD drives)\n\n\nIs there a way to run this drive copy that takes less that 96 hours? I am open to using tools other than dd.\nI need to clone the following partitions (including UUIDs)\n\n\n*\n\n*Fat32 EFI Partition (*)\n\n*NTFS Windows Partition (*)\n\n*HFS+ OSX Partition \n\n*EXT4 Ubuntu Partition (*)\n\n*Swap Partition (*)\n\n\n* Supported by Clonezilla\n\nI have tried Clonezilla (and it was MUCH faster), but it does not support HFS+ smart copying, which I need. Maybe the newest version supports this?\nWhen I made my first clone, I did all of the partitions except HFS+ and it went very quickly. (No more than 3 hours total)\n\nA: In my experience, I don't think there is something faster in the command line as dd. Adjusting the bs parameter can increase the speed, for example, I have 2 HDD that I know have a read/write speed greater than 100 MB/s so I do this:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=100M\n\nThere is also pv (Needs to be installed first) that checks for the fastest speed on both drives and then proceeds on cloning. This has to be done of course from root:\npv < /dev/sda > /dev/sdb\n\nWith PV I got 156 MB/s\nThe nice thing about pv apart from the speed is that it shows the progress, current speed, time since it began and ETA. In regards to HFS+ I would not know, am just trying to help on the \"speed\" part. With pv or a very optimized bs parameter, you can do a 4 TB drive in less than 7 Hours (6 Hours 50 Minutes at a current speed of 150 MB/s).\n\nI did a couple of tests with the connection types you were using and others I had available. I was using the Asus Z87 Pro and the Intel DZ68DP. This were my results, but first we need to know that the theoretical speeds for many transfer rates (Raw speeds) are just that, theory. Doing real tests revealed they are between 40% to 80% of that raw speed. This tests can change depending on Device used, connection type, motherboard, type of connecting cable, filesystem type and more.

I used Xbuntu 14.04 live cd on a usb. Popped out the win computer's DVD and put the SSD in its place. Installed partclone and tried this:\npartclone.ntfs -b -N -s /dev/sda3 -o /dev/sdb3\nPartclone puked on the ntfs needing chkdisk run in Windows, so a quick fix got partclone happy:\nntfsfix -b /dev/sda3\nntfsfix -d /dev/sda3\n\nAll commands run as root. Partclone's ncurses UI (the -N option) said the transfer was 7GB/min and ended up at 5GB/min, which equates to 83MB/sec. The great part is partclone doesn't copy unused space, so this made the clone remarkably fast.\nAdditional potential gotchyas:\n\n\n*\n\n*if the drive you are transferring to was previously used, it might have remnants of a GPT. Windows 7 factory installs are usually msdos/mbr partition tables. You'll need to remove the GPT fragments from the destination drive. This Unix & Linux QA helped me with this. You have to use gdisk on the device, use x then z and yes to zap GPT data and make sure you KEEP the MBR.\n\n*And don't forget if you don't do a device level dd, you'll need to copy the MBR using\ndd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1\nwhere sdb is source or old drive and sda is destination or new drive  (source)\n\nA: dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=100M status=progress\n\nI managed to get 430 MB/s when I was making an image from a SATA SSD to a NVME SSD \n\nA: To copy a partition wholesale, use cat instead of dd. I ran benchmarks a while ago, copying a large file rather than a partition, between two disks (on the same disk, relative timings are different):\ndd bs=64M    51.3\ndd bs=1M     41.8\ndd bs=4k     48.5\ndd bs=512    48.9\ncat          41.7\ncp           45.3\n\nThe conclusion from this benchmark is that the choice of block size for dd matters (but not that much), and cat automatically finds the best way to make a fast copy: dd can only slow you down. With a small block size, dd wastes time making lost of tiny reads and writes. With a large block size, one disk remains idle while the other is reading or writing. The optimal rate is achieved when one disk reads while the other disk writes.\nTo copy a partition, it may be faster to copy the files with cp -a. This depends on how many files there are and how much of the filesystem is free space. Copying files has an overhead that's roughly proportional to the number of files, but on the other hand copying free space wastes time.\nThe maximum data rate for USB2 is a little under 50 MB/s which works out to 6–7 hours to transfer 1TB. This assumes a hard disk that's fast enough to saturate the USB bus; I think the faster 7200 rpm drives can do it but 5900rpm might not be that fast (maybe they are for linear writes?).\nIf either disk is in use in parallel, this can slow down the copy considerably as the disk heads will need to move around.\n\nA: The problem is your connection type, and block size. For the fastest results your block size should be half the lowest write speed you typically receive. This will give you a safe margin, but still allow for a large number; of course you need to have enough ram to hold the data too.\nUsb 2.0 is 12 megabits per second (Mbps), Usb 2.0 High Speed is 480 Mbps. This is of course the raw speed; with 8 bits in a byte and framing overhead, the usable speed in MB/s is usually a decimal place over. So for example 480 raw, becomes 48MBs usable. Keep in mind that this is the mathematical best, in the real world it will be a bit lower. For usb 2.0 high speed connections you should expect somewhere around 30-35 MBs max write speed, provided the actual storage device can equate or surpass the connection speeds.\n\nA: I've been recently creating an image of 100GB partition (HDD) and write it to the new SSD disk.\nHere's a tip that can drastically speed up the process :)\nSplit file into smaller parts (the bigger the file is, the slower it works)\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda3 conv=sync,noerror bs=2M | split -a 3 -d -b 1G - /maindisk.img\n\nDuring the process, you can check the speed using (in separate terminal)\npgrep -l '^dd$' #to find PROCESSID\nkill -USR1 PROCESSID #to check the speed\n\nThen, when you have a directory full of result files (maindisk.img000, maindisk.img001, and so on...)\nuse\nsudo cat maindisk.img* | sudo dd of=/dev/sda1\n\nto 'burn' the image into the new partiton of SSD (parition must be the same size as the old one)\nTo me it worked a loooot faster than usual way (without splitting). Average speed of creating the image was ~13MB/s. When I use the 'normal' way it starts with ~15MB/s and then decreasing to 1MB/s.\n\nA: For anyone finding this thread, it is much easier and faster to just use a tool designed for data recovery like ddrescue. It tries to rescue the good parts first in case of read errors. Also you can interrupt the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point.\nRun it twice:\nFirst round, copy every block without read error and log the errors to rescue.log.\nsudo ddrescue -f -n /dev/sdX /dev/sdY rescue.log\n\nSecond round, copy only the bad blocks and try 3 times to read from the source before giving up.\nsudo ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/sdX /dev/sdY rescue.log\n\nNow you can mount the new drive and check the file system for corruption.\nMore info:\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html \n\nA: Id recommend the input/read - file/disk to be on SATA to boost read speeds. The USB 2.0 High speed is good too as I am getting average speeds of 33816 kb/s with ddrescue compared to when the setting was USB 2.0 to SATA at 2014 kb/s\n\nA: Use a different block size. It's the amount of data that dd reads at a time. If reading too little, a greater share of time is spent on the program logic and if read too much, much time is spent moving the large data around.\nTo measure the speed at different block sizes, use the following bash script:\n\n\n*\n\n*set $dev to the device\n\n*fix cbtotal to be at least 5x your expected read speed\n\n\n    (set -o errexit; skip=0; cbtotal=$((120*1024**2)); bs=256;\n    for power in `seq 10`; do\n      bs=$((bs*2)); skip=$((skip/2)); count=$((cbtotal/bs));\n      if [ \"$count\" -lt 1 ]; then break; fi;\n      echo $bs;\n      dd if=$dev of=/dev/null skip=$skip bs=$bs count=$count\n      skip=$((skip+count))\n    done)\n\nThe result may be biased towards a larger size due to the disk reading ahead - that's why it's important to set cbtotal large enough.\n", "Q: How can I install applications (with apt-get) to an external disk? I'm on a chromebook running Ubuntu inside a chroot via crouton. Thus, I have limited space. However, I have an external 32GB (extremely) high-speed SD Card. I'd like to install some of my larger programs via apt-get onto the external disk rather than internal SSD.\nWhat's the best way to execute this? Most of my apt-get installations will stay in the internal drive so I shouldn't symlink the whole /opt directory. Is it safest and most efficient to install large packages via apt-get to the default directory and then cut the specific package's files and folders to the SD Card and symlink them back to the original location?\nIn addition, when I'm dealing with a mixture of software and files, what is the best format for my SD Card? I don't intend on sharing files with other devices/OS's via the SD Card often or ever.\n\nA: I don't know of any way to get apt-get to install to external memory. The individual symlink seems the best way to go, although a bit tedious(maybe you could write a bash script to do this for you?).

It's a bit of a learning curve, but the beauty is that you can install it on almost any OS. Secondly, because it's a terminal client, it helps to login to remote servers to edit files. Lastly, there is also a graphical version (gvim) if you prefer, but uses the same basic interface and command syntax. VIM is very powerful, but it's power is mostly hidden from the get go.

I am reading about GPT partitioning and wonder whether it is useful in my case.

(bios_grub)\n\n*How to verify SSD partitions are aligned? I read, you have to make a 2mb free space before making partitions and then resize it to 1mb free space preceding in gparted for proper alignment. is this still valid?\n\n*Do we need to keep free, unpartitioned space(for 180GB 7% is 13-14GB unpartitioned space) for \"over provisioning\"\n\n*tmpfs for logs and other frequently written files? I have only 4GB ram and will I have to keep the firefox, chrome files on RAM?\n\n\nA: On a sub-2TiB disk, the advantages of GPT are modest, but real. The gdisk documentation site you referenced includes information on those advantages.\nIf your motherboard is really only two years old, it almost certainly does use EFI. EFI became nearly universal in mid-2011. In fact, many Intel boards used EFIs well before then. Many of these implementations have user interfaces that look just like older BIOSes, though. I've got an Intel motherboard that's got just one EFI option buried somewhere in its menus, so it's easy to overlook. When enabled, the computer boots in EFI mode; when disabled (the default), it uses its Compatibility Support Module (CSM) to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nIf you boot from GPT in BIOS mode with GRUB 2, a BIOS Boot Partition (signified by a bios_grub flag in parted and related tools) is strongly recommended, although there are ways to boot without it. A BIOS Boot Partition is not required when booting in EFI mode, or with boot loaders other than GRUB 2.\nWhen booting in EFI mode, an EFI System Partition (ESP), identified in parted by a boot flag, is required. (Note that a GPT disk's boot flag is entirely unrelated to the boot flag on an MBR disk.) Note that a disk can contain both a BIOS Boot Partition and an ESP. Setting up the disk in this way can enable you to switch boot modes relatively easily, so if you're not sure what you want to use, preparing the disk this way makes sense.\nSSD partition alignment is a bit tricky. Many SSDs are happy with the same 1MiB (2048-sector) alignment that's the default for most modern partitioning programs. Others require something higher, like 1.5MiB or 2MiB.

But panel is not transparent. Its just white. How can i make it transparent ?\n\nA: TL;DR: Theme overrides our styling.\nBudgie has issues with the default Ubuntu themes, such as Radiance and Ambiance. Also note popovers will be transparent on Ubuntu 14.04 due to not having GTK 3.12 available.\nSeveral themes unfortunately do things in incredibly inefficient ways, overriding many of the styling changes I implemented within Budgie..\nI would recommend for now going with a more recent theme such as Numix or Vertex, or indeed even iris, which recently gained Budgie support. Not all themes from 3.10 work with our popover, despite us providing fallback support. It's just unavoidable as everyone uses different names for the same thing in their themes (@bg_color, @theme_bg_color ...)\nI personally use Vertex, though of course this is entirely up to yourself :) \nEdit: Please do not use the GNOME 3.12/Staging PPA with Budgie Desktop, due to a conflicting set of package names for differing mutter versions, Budgie will be non-installable.\n\nA: Budgie Desktop's normal theme is Arc. Other themes might not work well the same way an xfce theme doesn't work well in Unity. To install it, just download the deb, click the link above. This gives some transparency to the panel.\nMoreover, I suggest the normal icon theme for this DE, Moka. To install it you should open a terminal and copy-paste these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:moka/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install moka-icon-theme\n\nEven if these themes are not your taste, Budgie desktop is quite a new and naive desktop, and isn't yet as mature. For now, these are the only themes that are made for Budgie Desktop. If you don't like these, then you'd better run into another DE until Budgie gets mature enough for your taste.\n\n", "Q: How can I configure Lenovo S540 touchpad on ubuntu 14.04?

I tried to redefine them by means of the keyboard shortcuts but was not successful as I tried a few combinations (including Alt+Tab) but no one of them works. Any new trick? Thanks a lot. \n\nA: I'm guessing that you might have installed a third-party program that interrupts the shortcut. If you installed anything weird, try uninstalling it.\nYou might want to check out your keys and see if they are working properly physically. It might not be Ubuntu's fault.\nIf all else fails, you could always use Xubuntu 14.04 (or Xfce on Ubuntu) instead. Alt+tab works fine for me there.

How do I make a cls-type command for Ubuntu/Linux that will not only clear the terminal emulator screen, but also make it so you can't scroll up to see the stuff you cleared? Note that the clear command does not eliminate the text. It just scrolls it up out of view. Also, any information about setting it up as a system-wide command, called cls would be helpful (especially nice for Windows users coming to Linux).\n\nA: Make a script, name it cls, make it executable (chmod +x cls), and give it these contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nprintf \"\\033c\"\n\nBefore you add it to your path, you may want to make sure there are no programs called cls already:\nupdate-alternatives --config cls\n\nThen, to add it to your path system-wide, put your script in a safe system location, such as /opt/bin/cls and use update-alternatives to add it to the path for all users:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/cls cls /opt/bin/cls 0\n\nYou can place your script in ~/bin (the tilde stands for your home directory) for it to be in a single user's path (if you had to create the bin directory, you'll need to restart your computer before it will be in your path. There's no need to do anything with update-alternatives in this case.\n\nA: As already mentioned by @user2962794, The command to clear the terminal is issuing the escape code \\033c. This is the VT-100 ANSI escape sequence for resetting the terminal to its initial state (RIS, see here) and is an ASCII \"Escape\" character (\\033) followed by a c.\nTherefore, to clear your terminal, all you need is one of\nprintf printf \"\\033c\"\n\nor \necho -ne \"\\033c\"\n\nTo make that simpler, you can create an alias for it. Add this line to your ~/.bashrc:\nalias cls=\"printf '\\033c'\"\n\nNow, open a new terminal and running cls will clear it. Note that if there already is a command named cls, this will supersede it. Make sure you choose a name that is unique to avoid this.\n", "Q: front panel audio jack not working I have a problem with my front panel audio jack. It is not working after I plug in my headphones.

I followed, rebooted the system and then instead of my name in the welcome screen I saw the guest instead. While searching the net I found that root user is locked in ubuntu. Because i modified my username to match the root user, even my account is locked ( i think). \nHow can i get it back? \nsudo is not working with guest account (as expected) \n\nA: Boot your PC while holding Ctrl+Shift, you should see the GRUB menu appear. While focusing on the first Ubuntu entry, press e to edit it.\nYou should see a line which ends with ro quiet splash --. Change this last part to:\nrw verbose init=/bin/bash --\n\nDon't touch the first part of the string, leave it the same as before. Now press Ctrl+X to boot. You should boot straight into a root shell. Now type:\nsudo passwd sanchit\n\nChoose a new password for your user. To recover the modified information, you should also do:\nsudo nano /etc/passwd\n\nRestore the correct user id and group for your user (they are both 1000 instead of 0). Now type the following command to mount your filesystem back in read only mode:\nsync\nmount -o remount,ro /\n\nNow switch off your PC using the power button. Turn the PC on again and it should work. If I can add a bottomline: next time, think twice before making these kind of changes to system files.\n", "Q: 14.04 update broke my rutorrent setup I just updated my system and now my rutorrent isn't working.

A bit more detail for real beginners:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy Wubi to the hard disk from the CD. If you do not do it, Wubi just launches the CD install.\n\n*Open a command window:\nOption A\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Windows Start button, click and write cmd + Enter.\n\n*Then you need to change directory to the one containing wubi.exe.\n\n\nOption B\n\n\n*\n\n*Open an explorer window and navigate to the folder containing wubi.exe.\n\n*Then press Shift and right-click the folder icon.\n\n*From the popup menu, select Open window command window here.\n\n\n*Execute wubi disabling MD5 check. Write wubi --skipmd5check.\nFollow the on-screen instructions to install a Wubi system.\n", "Q: Which installation type should I choose I am trying to install Ubuntu for first time to try it.\nI have an empty 49GB partition created by xp when installed.\nI have got to intallation type and selected 'something else'\nI now have\n/dev/sda\n/dev/sda1 ntfs\n/dev/sda2 ntfs\n\n\n\n*\n\n*under that I have new partition table/add/change etc\n\n*under that I can choose 'Device for boot loader Installation'\n\n\nThere seems to be multiple combinations to choose and I don't know what boot loader means.\nCan you suggest what my best choice(s) would be please?\n\nA: I assume you want a dual boot? Then stop with what you are doing. This can go bad: it will remove parts of your XP installation if you do not identify the correct one.\nThe easiest method to choose is to...\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot back into Windows.\n\n*Use a windows tools (like partition magic) to shrink 1 of your partitions and to create an unallocated partition of 20Gb or more. Or if the 49 Gb partition is still empty to delete the partition. \n\n\nBoot Ubuntu and choose to install in the unallocated partition (either with the choice \"install alongside Windows XP\" or with \"something else\" and picking the partition that shows \"unallocated space\" and NOT the one marked NTFS).\nThis will make sure you will pick the correct one without having to guess what partition to use. \n\nA: I think it's worth pointing out that there are many of us who want to create a dual-boot machine so we can eventually migrate from the now defunct xp to newer windows or maybe Linux.\nNot being familiar with Ubuntu/Linux we will want to have xp on one partition and ubuntu on another.\nThen we can take time weaning from one to the the other, to see if it can cope with everything we need and if we like it.\nWe need an install choice that will see a blank partition and ask if that's the one for Linux (which obviously it nearly always will be).\nI tried twice to achieve this including the choice for 'alongside xp' as suggested above. This time I installed xp on 39GB leaving the remainder of the 250GB disk for Ubuntu.\nUnlike stated in the advice above, the install went ahead with no info given, or requested, and placed itself on the 39GB partition, with XP, even though it had seen the empty, this time unformatted, partition.\nThe Ubuntu guys really need to get their act together and modify the 'installation Type' page so that people unfamiliar with this stuff are better enabled to make the required choice easily.\nCurrently there is no way non-Linux users can predict the outcome of each choice.\nIf this issue is addressed, I may try again but there is currently nothing easily available that helps.\n", "Q: RTL8188CUS unable to install 14.04 Tried to compile driver from realtek.

Connected the scanner and then looked for a software on my 14.04 to work it. It seems like I have simple scan of SANE installed, but can't find it. When looking for applications in the startup menu nothing at all appears. When searching for scanner or similar I get references. Think somehing is wrong with the Startup (not sure of the term, my OS is in Spanish and its called inicio). Would appreciate a tip on how to run any application that is not clearly visible, but right now need to find the scanner. Thanks.\n\nA: Type simple in Dash (top icon in the launcher) and it should show Simple Scan if you have it installed. Click on Simple Scan which should open the utility. \nIn the launcher on the left of your screen, you should see the Simple Scan Icon (a flat bed scanner). Right click on it and select Lock to Launcher.\nIn future, you can open the utility simply by clicking on the icon in the launcher or by typing simple-scanfrom terminal.\n", "Q: what exactly do the terms nomodeset, dual boot an wubi mean? I am having this really weird problem of booting my computer(Ubuntu 14.04,which I upgraded to from 12.04 just a day back)since it shows up a black screen every time, after I have chosen my OS(I have XP and Ubuntu ).So I found this site which addresses problems that seem similar.But it has these terms over here which I need some help in understanding.\n\nA: No-modeset: What does `nomodeset` do\nDual-boot means having 2 operating systems on a machine where you, during the -boot- process, select 1 of these to start. Technically it refers to 2 systems but you can have something like 255 operating system on your system (and most would still call this a dual boot).\nWith this method you will have 1 system active and 1 system dorment.\nWUBI is a method of installing Ubuntu -inside- a Windows (but NOT in Windows ME and NOT in Windows 8). You boot into Windows and within Windows you can start Ubuntu. WUBI was created as a tool for people interested in Ubuntu but who did not want to mess with their partitions to get a dual-boot. (so it should not be used as a permanent method for using Ubuntu). \nIf you want to install Ubuntu inside Windows you can also use virtualBox, VMWare or another \"virtual machine\" software.\n", "Q: Why do I have this start session? \nHi everyone,\nI have this problem. I install Ubuntu mate in my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but don't like it, so i remove it from Ubuntu.\nThe problem is that I have this start up panel and I want the default Ubuntu unity..\nAny help will be much appreciated.\nThank you.\n\nA: You can set the default login manager by running:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nMore information is available on the Ubuntu wiki.\n\nA: Maybe when you install mate it replaced lightdm.\nYou should install lightdm again.\nsudo apt-get install lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\n", "Q: Copy from remote tmux+Vim to local clipboard I use Kubuntu and sometimes I ssh out into a server and attach to a tmux session there.\nIs there any way I can select -using the mouse or the keyboard- a large chunk of text (more than une screen long, at least) from Vim or the shell and get it into my local system's clipboard?\n\nA: You can use xclip to get clipboard text to/from your x server to/from the remote system if you used -X in your ssh command when you made the connection.  You have to have xclip installed on the system to which you are attaching.  I imagine other clipboard apps can do it, too.  But anyway, configure tmux to call xclip, and you should be good.

The bug does not appear when I logout without closing the lid. But if I log out and close it afterwards the same problem appears.\nI use a Sony Vaio with an Nvidia Geforce and an Intel i5.\n\nA: You can try installing proprietary drivers for your video card.\nGoto System Settings >> Software and Updates\nClick on Additional Drivers tab\nChoose the Proprietary driver with Updates\nClick on Apply Changes\nReboot, and try again.\n", "Q: Erase and re-install I have switched fully to Ubuntu. I have added to many additional items and would simply like to perform an erase and reinstall. However, I can only find install packages that boot from windows or mac. Is there none for installing ubuntu from ubuntu?\n\nA: If you download the live CD installer and burn it to CD or install it to USB, it will allow you to boot the system and install Ubuntu regardless of the operating system initially installed thereupon.  There does not need to be any OS at all installed, in fact.\nDownload the live CD .iso here http://www.ubuntu.com/download\n", "Q: Multiple clocks on desktop I need to constantly check time for multiples timezones, I run kubuntu and I need to change the timezone every time to do that (or check on the web).\nI couldn't find any app that could show multiples clocks for different timezones on my desktop, is there any app of this kind?\n\nA: You can use Screenlets clock widget  to show time with different time zone.\nIn the image I am using two clocks with 2 different time zone.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*First you need to install screenlets. Install it using sudo apt-get install screenlets.\n\n*Now Open Screenlets manager and add two clock on the desktop.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now Right click on the Clock present on your desktop and goto  properties -> options -> clocks and set the Time Zone.\n\n*Repeat it for other clock.\n\n\n. \n\nA: You should look into Conky, you could modify it so it shows you different time zones.  \nLocal: $alignr ${time %H:%M:%S}\nUTC: $alignr ${utime %H:%M:%S}\nCST: $alignr ${tztime /America/Chicago %H:%M:%S}\n\nWould display the Local time, UTC time, and CST time.  \nHere is the Ubuntu install guide!\n", "Q: Install crossbuild-essential-armhf on amd64 Right now, while working on my laptop (amd64), I can already compile code through SSH on a BeagleBone (armhf). \nWhat I'm trying to do now, is being able to use any IDE to debug that code (Code::Blocks, KDevelop, or Qt Creator).\nSo, I thought of running gdbserver on the BeagleBone, and connecting to it, but it gives me an error of unexpected value on reply. I read about it, and it seems I need to locally build an armhf executable, for gdb to process. But I guess it also needs an armhf-oriented gdb built for amd64, so I tried installing crossbuild-essential-armhf. For that, I added the armhf architecture with dpkg --add-architecture armhf, but then I'm unable to do an apt-get update. I get a whole lot of these:\nErr http://security.ubuntu.com trusty-security/main armhf Packages             \n  404  Not Found [IP: 2001:67c:1562::13 80]\n\nIf I check the repos, they indeed do not have armhf anywhere.\nSo, what am I doing wrong? Also, is this the correct way to remote debug with a different architecture, or is there any better way to do it?\n\nA: Ubuntu uses separate repos for armh (i.e. http://ports.ubuntu.com/).\nTo be able to install crossbuild-essential-armhf successfully you have to follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*run dpkg --add-architecture armhf\n\n\n*specify the correct architecture for ALL your apt deb lines in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d, for example:\ndeb [arch=amd64,i386] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main universe\ndeb [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ trusty main universe\n\nNote that it does not make sense to specify the arch for deb-src lines.\n3. run apt-get update\n4. run apt-get install crossbuild-essential-armhf\nHave a look at https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO\nYou may also want to execute these commands in a chroot (or docker container maybe) as mentioned by this guide: Getting Started with MultiArch (armel / armhf) in Ubuntu\n\nA: There is a rich choice of Docker based cross compilers here :\nhttps://github.com/dockcross/dockcross\n\nA: It isn't necessary to add armhf to the build host's dpkg sources. Another approach is to use a chroot which can be populated using debootstrap or from a beagleboard.org image.\nFor a thorough guide on C++ cross-compilation with remote GDB symbolic debugging with VS Code see:\nhttps://takeofftechnical.com/x-compile-cpp-bbb\n", "Q: Database error.

I have Windows 7 64 bit installed on one partition (the rest of the disk is unallocated). I made a live USB with the latest official Kubuntu 14.04 64 bit ISO. When I boot, there are two USB options: with UEFI or without. I have Windows 7 in \"legacy BIOS mode\" so I choose the one without UEFI.\nWhen I boot into this one, I briefly see a splash screen (similar to this, but a black background), then the screen goes blank and enters sleep mode after a few seconds. Why does this happen and what can I do?\nNote: I have also tried booting into the \"UEFI: Sandisk Cruzer\" option to see if it works. Installation starts normally (the monitor doesn't sleep etc.) but it doesn't recognize that Windows 7 is there, it thinks the entire disk is free space.\nThank you in advance.\nEdit: After some more messing around and BSODs, I got my computer to work as I wanted (though I never found an exact answer to the original question). In case it helps anyone:\nI followed this guide religiously. Part of it is to correctly put Windows 7 64 bit on a USB, where it links to another guide. I had trouble with it from another computer that has XP (the GPT option didn't appear), so I ended up installing Windows 7 non-UEFI, in order to make a UEFI Windows 7 USB in the first place. It was messy, but it worked. Then I installed Kubuntu with UEFI, it recognized everything well, and manual partitioning automatically chose the mount point of the EFI partition which was created by Windows.\n\nA: If its partitioned already, and the free space is unallocated it, it may only be picking up the free space, resize the partition in Win7, all back to Win7, and use the Kubuntu's installers partitioner to install along side windows 7, theirs no need to partition it before hand. \n\nA: From the Windows OS, you need to turn off things like fast startup (power option), dynamic partitions, (and raid if that's present).  Then the installer should see your Windows partitions.  You unsuccessful startup of live-media looks like a video problem, try the nomodeset option (F6 list) from the initial grub screen (with the Try/INstall choice).

Help would be appreciated.\n\nA: \nHowever I have a revocation certificate on my USB drive and I would like to revoke the key.\n\nYou're lucky, lots of people don't have one and would be lost now.\nUsing the Command Line\n$ gpg --import /path/to/usb/revocert-01324567.asc\ngpg: key 01324567: no public key - can't apply revocation certificate\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\n\nYou already correctly found the way to import the revocation certificate, but it still misses your public key. This is very easy to import, just run\ngpg --recv-keys [key-id]\n\nNow import the key using the command formerly failed:\ngpg --import [revocation-certificate-file]\n\nAfter doing so, send the keys back to the key servers again:\ngpg --send-keys [key-id]\n\nReplace [key-id] and [revocation-certificate-file] by your key id  respectively revocation certificate filename. It seems you still know your key id (looks like it is contained in your revocation certificate file name), otherwise use gpg --search [mail address] to query the key servers for the ID.\nUsing a Web Interface\nAn alternative (if your revocation certificate is an ASCII-armored file, thus not binary) would be to use the web interface of any keyserver of your choice, where you can directly paste the revocation certificate. The one of http://keyserver.ubuntu.com doesn't have a separate field for revocation certificates, but the \"Submitting a new OpenPGP Key\" field should also accept your (ascii-armored) revocation certificate. Search for your key afterwards to verify whether it was correctly revoked.\nSynchronization of the Revocation Certificate\n(Most) key servers gossip with each other and exchange new key data, including your revocatino certificate.

My language settings says I have a lot of English variants installed: English (United States), English, English (Australia), English (Canada), etc, etc. But I have no need for these other Englishes, only \"English (United States)\". \nThis causes me a lot of trouble, since depending on what program I'm using, the spell checker will tell me that I'm spelling things incorrectly because I'm using American instead of British spelling, and my language preferences in this respect don't seem to be sticking. \nAlso, every time I open my language settings, I'm warned that \"The langauge support is not installed completely,\" that \"Some translations or writing aids available for your chosen languages are not installed yet.\" It lists these as the packages that I need to install: \nlibreoffice-l10n-en-za\nthunderbird-locale-en-gb\nmythes-en-au\nlibreoffice-l10n-en-gb\nlibreoffice-help-en-gb\nhunspell-en-ca\n\nYet at no point did I choose New Zealand English or Canadian English as my chosen languages.

They key phrase here is may be. It's not uncommon to do so. But the default Ubuntu installation settings don't do so, so you don't have /var on a separate partition.\n\nThere are many scenarios where /var belongs on a different filesystem (or even a different disk):\n\n\n*\n\n*You have an application that does a lot of logging. In this case you'd want to protect root (/) from becoming full.\n\n*You're using an SSD for / and have an application that makes a lot of read/writes to /var. In this case you'd want it on a normal HDD.\n\n*You're using an application that is I/O intensive (using both storage space and a lot of read/writes), such as a mail server. In this case you'd want /var on a RAID array.\n\n\nAnd so on...

Everyday at 12AM  wget should automatically pick up where it left the night before, and at 5AM, it should automatically pause the download, so it can resume the following night.\nHow can I script this in Ubuntu? What tools do I need?\n\nA: A combination of an Upstart job and a cron job:\nFirst, create an Upstart job. Create a file called ~/.config/upstart/my-download.conf containing:\ndescription \"My download job.\"\nstart on resume-download\nstop on stop-download\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 10 5\n\nscript   \n     cd /path/to/download/folder\n     wget --continue uri://link/to/download    \nend script\n\nNow, add a cron job to start and stop this Upstart job. Run EDITOR=gedit crontab -e and add to the file:\n0 0 * * * /sbin/initctl emit resume-download\n0 5 * * * /sbin/initctl emit stop-download\n\nYou can manually start the download any time you want using:\ninitctl emit resume-download\n# or\nstart my-download\n\nAnd stop it any time using:\ninitctl emit stop-download\n# or\nstop my-download\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Due to the respawn in the job, Upstart will try to restart wget if it exits. This can be useful if it timed out and exited at two in the morning. A limit is placed so that we don't have Upstart trying to start wget infinitely (e.g., the network is facing extended problems, the download was completed, etc.).\n\n*We added initctl emit commands in the cron job. This way, if we create more such Upstart jobs, all of them starting on this event, this single cron entry will be enough to start all of them.\n\n\nA: You will want to use the --continue flag of wget and cron jobs.\nYou can have a cron entry to start a script at 12AM with using timeout. See\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/257345/can-i-limit-the-runtime-of-a-cronjob. Or you could run another script that kills/interrupts it at 5AM. \nExample for a daily script: 0 0 * * * timeout -s KILL 5h /path/to/command\nThe above example will run timeout on /path/to/command at 12:00am on every day of every month and send it a KILL signal after 5 hours. \nThis is how a cron job is laid out:\nminute (0-59), hour (0-23, 0 = midnight), day (1-31), month (1-12), weekday (0-6, 0 = Sunday) /path/to/command\nAn asterisk (*) can be used so that every instance (every hour, every weekday, every month, etc.) of a time period is used.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 14.04 on laptop Dell Inspiron 3147 using USB stick?

(some are paid, but some are free)\n\nA: If you're in college it's probably adviced to use the software that is suggested by your teachers because the lessons are based on those. You can easily set up a virtual machine with Windows on your machine however. Many institutes provide free versions of Windows to their students, but you will have to consult your school about that.\nAnyway, if you're determined to go entirely Ubuntu, you can do so.

Since it appears you have a Windows 8 installation disc you can always disable UEFI, and install both operating systems in CSM (legacy bios mode) with an MBR partition table.\nIf you wish to install under UEFI then use GPT for both operating systems. If Ubuntu isn't recognizing your partitions, open Gparted in the Ubuntu live-cd and verify that it DOES see the table. I would suggest creating the partition table in Gparted, installing Windows, and then installing Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to render a simple html file in localhost I am going through the David Malan lecture on php.\nSo I have created a simple google.html file on /public_html/google.html\nwhich is as follows:\n<!DOCTYPE html>    \n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Google</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div style = \"text-align: center\">\n    <h1>Google</h1>\n    <form action = \"http://www.google.com/search\" method = \"get\">\n      <input name = \"q\" style = \"width: 400px\" type = \"text\">\n      <br>\n      <input type = \"submit\" value = \"Google Search\">\n      <input type = \"submit\" value = \"I am feeling lucky\">\n    </form>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nWhen I tried to open http://localhost/~anupam/google.html, I got the \n\nERROR 404\nNot Found\n     The requested URL /~anupam/google.html was not found on this server.\nApache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) Server at localhost Port 80\n\nWhy am I unable to display it through localhost?

I would like to convert the slapd LDAP server init script to an Upstart service. However, I have very little knowledge of SysV init scripts (and the LSB(?) stuff).

Have I made mistakes?\nThings I haven't understood from the sysv script, I haven't included in the Upstart job. Could someone explain this sysv init script to me?\nThe relevant files are posted on GitHub.\n\nBackground:\nI have a few LDAP servers in N-way multi-master replication. There's a known bug which may be causing memory leaks, leading to the slapd daemons occasionally falling prey to the OOM Killer.\nMy options include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Getting slapd to respawn (the subject of this question).\n\n*Using a newer version of OpenLDAP (probably compiled from source).\n\n*Throwing more RAM at the server.\n\n\nA: I have written one here: https://bitbucket.org/CameronNemo/upstart-jobs/src/b5a709465304bdf420ca2507ed14f6fe67272de8/slapd.conf?at=master\nA few mistakes you made:\n\n\n*\n\n*There should be no -- between slapd and its options.\n\n*The start on events need to have an and between them.\n\n*virtual-filesystems should change to filesystem, as Letizia said.\n\n\nA: LSB Keyword\nAccording to LSBInitScripts:\n $remote_fs all filesystems are mounted. In some LSB run-time environments,\n            filesystems such as /usr may be remote. If the script need a mounted \n            /usr/, it needs to depend on $remote_fs. Scripts depending on $remote_fs\n            do not need to depend on $local_fs. During shutdown, scripts that need to\n            run before sendsigs kills all processes should depend on $remote_fs. \n\nwhile according to remote-filesystems man page:\n When it occurs, local filesystems such as /usr may not be mounted.  \n For most normal services the  filesystem(7)  event  is sufficient.\n\nYou should change remote-filesystems with filesystem event that:\n The  filesystem  event  is generated by the mountall(8) daemon after it\n has mounted all filesystems listed in fstab(5).\n\nRobustness\nSystemV init script check $SLAPD_CONF. If is not present any type of configuration, script fail to start, and stop terminates with exit 0 without doing anything.\nThis check are useful in case of rebooting between the installation phase and the configuration phase or during uninstall procedure. To understand its meaning you should analyze prerm and postrm scripts in /var/lib/dpkg/info.\nFor example prerm attempts to stop slapd, and if it fails than unistall procedure will fail too. stop procedure without configuration file will returns 0 to allow uninstall OpenLDAP package that is installed but not configured.\nFunction check_for_no_start() prevent start execution based on $SLAPD_NO_START variable or if $SLAPD_SENTINEL_FILE file exists. This is a simple way for temporarily disabling startup of slapd, for examples for maintenance. Even if server reboot, slapd will not start.\nFunctionality\nSystemV script create $piddir (if doesn't exist) and gives right permission to $SLAPD_PIDFILE, this is necessary because slapd will write pid in $SLAPD_PIDFILE.\nYou should add this in pre_start script.\nAccording to start-stop-daemon man page:\n    -S, --start [--] arguments\n              Check  for  the  existence  of  a  specified process.  If such a\n              process exists, start-stop-daemon does nothing, and  exits  with\n              error  status 1 (0 if --oknodo is specified).  If such a process\n              does  not  exist,  it  starts  an  instance,  using  either  the\n              executable  specified  by --exec or, if specified, by --startas.\n              Any arguments given after -- on  the  command  line  are  passed\n              unmodified to the program being started.\n\nThis is why you should remove -- in slapd command as CameronNemo said.\nFinally on stop there is option --retry TERM/10 that means:\n          schedule is a list of at least two items  separated  by  slashes\n          (/);  each  item  may be -signal-number or [-]signal-name, which\n          means to send that signal, or timeout, which means to wait  that\n          many  seconds  for processes to exit, or forever, which means to\n          repeat the rest of the schedule forever if necessary.\n\nI guess that OpendLDAP need a bit of time to shutdown, so you should add the stanza kill timeout 10, which will wait 10 seconds (vs. the default 5) to send slapd the SIGKILL.\n", "Q: Get exclusive lock constant?

According to this SO answer O_EXLOCK may not be available in Linux.\n", "Q: 12.04 Package System Broken apt-get autoremove -f fails I am trying to install all of the latest updates for Ubuntu 12.04.\nNew hardware support and linux-image-3.11.0-26-generic (New install) 57.1MB are what I have remaining.\nUpdate Manager tells me \"Package System Broken\" and suggests I use apt-get autoremove -f to fix unmet dependencies.\nRunning this gives me an error with no additional tips on how to fix it.

I'm thinking about buying a 30GB SSD for my laptop and want to know if it's possible to install Linux on it via flash drive with nothing else needing to be done. I just don't want to spend the money on it unless I know for sure I can do this.\n\nA: Provided your computer supports booting from usb, yes you can to an ssd. If haven't booted from usb before you should try before purchasing.\nInstall unetbootin, create the live-usb, and the reboot the computer and press the appropriate F# key (varies from system to system) to enter either your BIOS, or your quick-boot menu. \nIf you enter the quick-boot menu, then choose your usb device, and it will try to boot from it.\nIf you enter the BIOS then you'll need to change your boot order to removable first, save your changes, and then exit the BIOS.\n\nA: Should be able to fine.  I've never installed on laptop but several on desktop.\n\nA: I've installed 12.04 on several 10GB drives with no problems by booting off of a flash drive to install it.

I bought a dedicated server and i'm still trying to get access via Putty and Remote Desktop Connection (Windows 7) to work inside the server without terminal (i love terminal :P). Following some guides on the internet, I installed\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nand then I launch \"startx\" but...\n(Pastebin cause I can't insert more than two links :P)\nhttp://pastebin.com/kkLAsCEt\n\nA: First off, your Xorg config fails at the GLX module. This appears to be a system bug and as such can not really be fixed.\nSecondly, why are you even trying to RDP into a server?! There are two problems with that:\n\n\n*\n\n*RDP is a Windows-only protocol. It's not really going to work with Ubuntu.\n\n*Security. Need I say more?\n\n\nYou really should use SSH only. Set up a server and just use PuTTY everywhere. You say you like the terminal anyways...\nThirdly, why do you need a GUI on a server? That is a dangerous can of worms that can break a lot. Ubuntu Server + GUI = *Kablooie!*\n\nA: I have been messing around with a program called Webmin, which allows remote admin capability for a command line interface server from a browser with a nice GUI. and it's very easy to install and set up. Here's a good Webmin installation guide.\nYou can also download Cygwin, which allows you to run a linux-like command shell on top of windows, and ssh into your server, although that would be terminal. \nI have been told by all the pros though that you really should embrace terminal, especially if your running a server. If you still have to have a desktop GUI you could just install TeamViewer, which is a remote desktop tool, and manage it that way.\n", "Q: I want to install wifi card, but my additional drives is empty Today, I install Ubuntu 14.04 version.

Hello im just new for Linux \nI know that  sudo apt-get   is for installing application \nbut how I would know that I have installed the latest version of the application \nfor example apt-get install sun-java6-jdk \nis there an option to upgrade or see the latest version \nor its ok to install an old version the application and Linux will upgrade it for me ?\n\nA: Use the apt-cache policy command:\n$ apt-cache policy openjdk-6-jre\nopenjdk-6-jre:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 6b32-1.13.4-4ubuntu0.14.04.1\n  Version table:\n     6b32-1.13.4-4ubuntu0.14.04.1 0\n        500 http://aptmirror.fqdn/ubuntu/ trusty-security/universe amd64 Packages\n     6b31-1.13.3-1ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://aptmirror.fqdn/ubuntu/ trusty/universe amd64 Packages\n\nIt says that I don't have any version installed, and of the available versions, 6b32-1.13.4-4ubuntu0.14.04.1 (the candidate) will be installed if I do sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre.\nEven if you have it installed already, if you do sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre, the latest version available (according to the Candidate field above) will be installed. So an installed package will be upgraded.\nYou can press CtrlC to exit from most programs, including sudo password prompts and apt-get. It's a very bad idea to do so with apt-get. You can cancel while the download is in progress, but once the installation begins, don't do so.\n", "Q: How do I recover .jpg files on Ubuntu? How do I recover delete files with just with just the .jpg extension in Ubuntu?\nI already tried \"photorec\", but it recovered all the files.\n\nA: Use Photorec. It is the absolute best tool for this job.\nWhen asked what partition to search, select the [File Opt] link at the bottom of the screen.\nIn there, tell it to only recover jpg files.\nLet it run, and problem solved!\n\nAlternatively, if you have already recovered, do this.\nFirst off, you need to be in the recup_dir folder. Once you are in a terminal in this folder, run these commands:\nmkdir ../Recovery/\nsudo mv *.jpg ../Recovery\ncd ..\nsudo rm -rf recup_dir\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER Recovery/\n\nDone! Note, the recup_dir folder will be deleted.\n\nA: The \"photorec\" available on Ubuntu 14.04 recovers all files, not just jpgs. Install \"foremost\" instead and run this: sudo foremost -t jpg -i /dev/sdb1, where /dev/sdb1 is changed to match the location of your Windows partition. That will recover just the JPEG format files. \nThis works regardless of the extension giving the file. That is, it will work on files named .jpg, .JPG, .jpeg and .JPEG.\n", "Q: New hard drive install I am thinking about installing new hard drive in laptop I want to insall Ubuntu 14.04 do I need to insall any drives or othe programs 1st or can I just plug in new hard drive and install Ubuntu \n\nA: Short answer: Yes, you can install the new HDD and boot the Ubuntu CD/USB and install.\n\nA: (Very) short answer: Yes.\nShort answer: Yes, but you can't keep data.\nLong answer: You most certainly can install a new compatible communications bus hard drive. Meaning, you can't install a SATA drive into an IDE port. However, you do not have the ability to save old data just by hotswapping drives.\nIf you want to save old data, you need to run a dd from the primary drive to the secondary drive. If you do not, just reinstall Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Why system assigns a \"volume name\" for a binded \"/tmp\"? (The problem is found on: KUbuntu 13.10)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Initially /tmp is not binded.\n\n*System has a volume with a label \"Vol_2\" (e.g., /dev/sda2).\n\n*A user logs in.\n\n*The user mounts the volume \"Vol_2\" to /media/Vol_2 (if this drive is not mounted yet; this one might be mounted in the previous session).\n\n*The user starts the file manager (Dolphin).\n\n*Device list contains an item \"Vol_2\". The file manager (Dolphin) for this device displays content of \"(/dev/sda2)/\".\n\n*The user runs:\nsudo mount --bind /media/Vol_2/tmp /tmp\n\n*The user starts the file manager (Dolphin).\n\n*Device list contains an item \"Vol_2\". The file manager (Dolphin) for this device displays content of \"(/dev/sda2)/tmp\" (not \"(/dev/sda2)/\").\n\n\n10. Why? Is this behavior defined by Ubuntu or by KDE?\n\n\n*The file manager (Dolphin) displays proper content of the folder \"/media/Vol_2\".\n\n\nA: THE ANSWER IS (found by me):\nProbably (as I can see), if a volume has more than 1 mountpoint, software (like file managers) always get FIRST mountpoint and associate this one with the volume label.\nMountpoints are ordered (as I can see) alphabetically, by descending.\nIn the case described above, a solution may be: to mount the volume to a folder, which has path (as string) alphabetically > than \"/tmp\". Eg., the volume may be mount to \"/zmedia/Vol_2\".\n\nI see that it works in my system.\n", "Q: Right after installing Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS it just don't work I've just installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (desktop, 32 bits version), when the computer reboots Ubuntu ask me for the user and password configure. Right after entering this information, the PC freezes, and the display shows a disturbed image \nI've tried the installation 3 times and it is the same problem. What is going wrong here?\n\nA: Looks like the display card is having some issue. Try booting the machine using a live USB bootable stick. See if that works, try re-installing the system and if terminal is accessible then do a \nsudo apt-get update \n\nfollowed by:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf terminal is not available, try rebooting the system and keep pressing F8 button on the keyboard and see the various boot options and select the recovery mode. See if that boots in a default resolution and then from there on you can do a update and upgrade and even search for additional drivers in the dash to check if Ubuntu finds a proprietary driver for your display driver. You could also try a full update and upgrade system from the recovery mode. You should have network mode enabled in the recovery.\n\nA: I was able to fix it finally. I've found the solution  on this post:\nhttp://www.howopensource.com/2012/10/install-nvidia-geforce-driver-in-ubuntu-12-10-12-04-using-ppa/\nFollowing those instruction the problem was solved and I'm now able to enjoy ubuntu.\nThanks.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to any Wifi in Ubuntu 14.04 I have Ubuntu 14.04.

I futzed around with it for quite a while, googled 'til my google got tired, etc., etc.\nFinally, I got a simple wifi analyzer for my phone and watched the reception at my workstation. Amazing how much variation there was over a short period of time. And, as the db went more negative, Ubuntu would drop the connection.\nLike you, it was a major hassle getting it back. Restarting the network worked - occasionally. Rebooting the machine worked - occasionally. And so on. I was lighting candles, standing on one foot and trying to hold my mouth just right.\nIn the end, I focused on getting a more stable signal to my workstation. I moved my access point to a better spot, added a bridge router using an old LinkSys router in the parts box for the other half of the house and voila! (or wallah if you live in Minnesota).\nEverything has been completely stable since then.\nMy conclusion is that the networking in 14.x is just more sensitive and caring about the signal while 13.x took what it could get. Right or wrong, there you go!\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu from USB in debian? After looking through the Ubuntu instructions for creating a bootable USB I googled this and it seems like there's a plethora of different ways that one could do this. Here's what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Ubuntu 14.04.1 desktop 64-bit iso.\n\n*Find a link explaining how to create a bootable ubuntu iso.\n\n*run dd if=path/to/iso of=/dev/sdd1 as per instructions.\n\n*Try to boot. Nothing (blinking cursor, no activity until I hit Ctrl+Alt+Del\n\n*Look for another link, this time telling me to install unetbootin\n\n*Try to boot, get a Failed to load COM32 file menu.c32. The suggested fix is to look for a file. Checked. Doesn't exist on my system.\n\n*Go and google again. This time I'm told debian ISOs can be copied directly. Maybe Ubuntu isos can be copied in this way? Nope.\n\n*Check instructions on Ubuntu website again. Instructions less than helpful.\n\n*Come here and ask.\n\n\nDoes anyone have a way of creating a bootable Ubuntu USB stick that works with Ubuntu 14.04 and can be used in a Debian system?\n\nA: Bootable ISO images contain a partition table and boot record, and thus must be written to a disk rather than to a partition. The dd command you ran wrote the ISO image to sdd1, which is the first partition of the disk sdd. Write it just to sdd instead.\ndd if=path/to/iso of=/dev/sdd\n\n\nOf course, as ubuntu_tr says, always check that sdd is actually the correct device, or you might overwrite and destroy data on a totally different drive. I've made this sort of mistake, and while my backups saved me, it was a considerable inconvenience! Remember that a removable device's device node entry can change between mounts. (And if there are other systems you administer, make sure you're not accidentally SSH'd into one of them and inadvertently running dd on it remotely.)\nUbuntu users--people using Ubuntu to write the Ubuntu (or other) ISO image to the flash drive--will need to run dd with sudo:\nsudo dd if=path/to/iso of=/dev/sdd\n\nOn Debian (the OS that Arman's using to create Ubuntu installation media), sudo is one of multiple widely used and supported options, the main other being to su to root with a separate root password. In contrast, Ubuntu systems almost always require sudo to run a command as root.\n\nA: dd if=Ubuntu\\ 14.04.1\\ desktop\\ 64-bit.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=512k\n\nsdb may change according to your system.

In the menu you should see the boot order and be able to change it if it isnt already set to boot from cd/dvd drive first. \nThis wont stop it from booting normally if you dont have a cd in the drive.\nWhen it boots from the cd you will be given the option to run it live or install. I would recommend trying it live first \n\nA: Most unfortunately I believe you will need to finish the installation of Windows first - the pre-installed system has not done it's final configurations yet, and it will be difficult to utilize the computer until this is complete.\nThe exception to this would be if you decide to dump Windows entirely - if you have Ubuntu downloaded from another computer, you could boot to the CD / USB and format the HDD, which would bypass the Windows configuration.\n", "Q: How to automatically opening terminal windows & tabs, ssh and sudo su?

I have looked through some questions but haven't found any direct answers- I am considering a Chromebook because of the cheap price, but not being able to connect to my school's networked printers would be a deal breaker. I read that ubuntu can be used on Chromebooks, but can it be used to print from printers on a network?\n\nA: Yes you can and we even have a document on the ubuntu.com website. From the link:\nOverview\nUbuntu supports printer sharing over networks, so you can print from your Ubuntu machine, your Windows machine, etc, to another Ubuntu or Windows machine that has a printer attached (ie a \"Ubuntu print server\" or \"Windows print server\"). \nBackground\nUbuntu uses the Common UNIX Printing System (\"CUPS\") to handle printing. CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (\"IPP\") as the basis for managing print jobs and queues. Other protocols are also supported (LPD, SMB, AppSocket a.k.a. JetDirect), some with reduced functionality.\nCUPS printer configuration and management is handled by the Printer Admin utility launched from the Gnome menu - System -> Administration -> Printing (If the menu item does not exist you need to add system-config-printer to the menu). Also IPP provides web services so after you have configured CUPS appropriately, you can access the printers and jobs via your web browser.\nWhen a locally attached printer is defined, eg using the Printer Admin utility, that printer is automatically published from this \"print server\" host to the network, depending on the server directives in the CUPS configuration file. A remote Ubuntu \"client\" host can then be able to see and use the printer attached to the server. The network printer automatically appears in the client's Printer Admin utility. It simply pops up if CUPS is up and configured correctly and disappears if you stop CUPS at either the Print Server or your local machine. \nMore about this in the link.\n\nDash->Printers\n\nIn the \"printer set up dialog\" there is a server->settings option at the top where you can set for the system to scan for network printers. In 14.04 it looks like this:\n\n\"Publish shared printers connected to this server\" needs to be selected and when searching for printers it will also scan for network printers. After that is a matter of selecting and adding the printers found.\n\nA: If you have a spare laptop o PC perhaps you could install Ubuntu on them and see if you can print. I can add my windows networked HP printer driver to my Ubuntu laptop and print. That is using a wireless connection to my router which then passes the request to the printer PC. As I say, it would be best if you could test this before you buy a Chromebook Laptop.\n\nA: If you know the IP of the printer, you might also be able to add the printer via that. Also via the \"add printer\" dialogue.\n", "Q: Need to override keyboard shortcut I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 for my development purpose.

I don't have idea how can I override this so that when I'm using my IDE it'll consider ctrl+backspace to give code suggestions. Can anyone help to resolve this ?\nThanks\n\nA: This stackoverflow question covers the exact same issue. Their conclusion is that Ubuntu will always prefer its shortcuts.

That solution works fine on Lubuntu too.\nThe instructions:\n\nIf you prefer to not allow guest access to your computer, you can disable the Guest Session feature. To do so, press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal window, and then run this command (it's one long command, even if it may be shown wrapped on the screen - copy and paste to get it right):\nsudo sh -c 'printf \"[SeatDefaults]\\nallow-guest=false\\n\" >/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-no-guest.conf'\n\nThe command creates a small configuration file.

I'm new to this whole Linux thing, and although I have been able to figure out how to set up Ubuntu thus far, there is one issue that bugs me.\nWhenever I attempt to restart the computer, it freezes at the purple screen with the dots and all that. Just, completely stops. I have had to remove the battery from my computer to force it to shut down.\nStrangely enough, there is no issue when I use the normal shutdown option. Only the reboot option. How can I fix this issue?\n\nA: Alright, so after a bit of fiddling around, I think I've found a solution. The problem, from my understanding, is that the kernel might not know what to do when it is asked to reboot on certain hardware. We can fix this.\nRight, so first, get yourself grub customizer. Once you have it, open it, go to general settings, and under kernel parameters there is a line that should say quiet splash.\nNow, once you have found that line, you have to edit it so it says quiet splash reboot=pci. After you have done that, you have to go to the terminal and update the grub file by writing sudo update-grub. Once that is done, shut down your pc and start it up again. \nAnd you're done! Note that the reboot process is a little slow. \nBut wait, what if it doesn't work? Never fear. You might have to change the \"=pci\" to something else. Below is a list of commands you can try. However, from my understanding, 90% of all the issues can be fixed with either \"=pci\", \"=bios\", or \"=acpi\".\nwarm =  Don’t set the cold reboot flag\n\ncold = Set the cold reboot flag\n\nbios = Reboot by jumping through the BIOS (only for X86_32)\n\nsmp = Reboot by executing reset on BSP or other CPU (only for X86_32)\n\ntriple = Force a triple fault (init)\n\nkbd = Use the keyboard controller. cold reset (default)\n\nacpi = Use the RESET_REG in the FADT\n\nefi = Use efi reset_system runtime service\n\npci = Use the so-called “PCI reset register”, CF9\n\nforce = Avoid anything that could hang.\n\nList was copied from this site \nHopefully that can help someone.\n\nA: You can pass boot parameters by editing GRUB's configuration file directly:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nThen change to above list. This worked for me. \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"reboot=pci\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"reboot=pci\"\n\n\nA: I've seen this bug a couple of times and as of yet have seen no fix other than a reinstall to fix corrupted packages sometimes. I know I don't seem to be helping much but basically the solution I suggest is to either live with shutting down and turning on and if you need to reboot and don't mind the effects a force shutdown sometimes has you can use alt+sysrq+b to do a force restart that basically crashes all processes and the computer restarts immediately.\n", "Q: Installing Desktop Environment, (machine offline) I tried updating my machine, to Ubuntu 13.10.\nAfter update, when I restarted my machine, there was no GUI (no login screen), but I could access terminal, and see my files and folders.\nTried various online advice, but to no avail.\nIt looks like its only Desktop Environment problem.

This is what I have found out already.\nMy hddtemp command reports the following after about 30 minutes of light use (browsing etc.) and remains at this temperature. At start up they are about 38°C and 24°C respectively.\n/dev/sda: KINGSTON SMS200S3120G: 56°C\n/dev/sdb: HGST HTS541010A9E680: 40°C\nsensors gives me the following:\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\n\ntemp1:        +14.0°C  (crit = +120.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\n\nAdapter: ISA adapter\n\nPhysical id 0:  +48.0°C  (high = +84.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\nCore 0:         +48.0°C  (high = +84.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\nCore 1:         +44.0°C  (high = +84.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\nnvidia-smi normally gives me a temp reading of about 40-45°C\nSo far I have been unable to find a way to give me reading from temperature of the Intel graphics chip. I think bumblebee is working OK as my lspci | grep VGA reads:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06)\n\nThis may be the issue as the heat comes from under the touchpad near where the mSata SSD is located but i think the gpu is located near it as well. This I don't think it is the SSD as I thought part of the advantage of the SSD was that they created little heat. The other thing I have noted is that fan never seems to come on in any heavy way which I was expecting but I think it is working in low mode. Fan does not show up in lm-sensors. I noted on one occasion that when I restarted and went into the BIOS that fan started to run a bit heavier.\nWhen I run fwts fan I get the following failure:\nFAILED [MEDIUM] NoFanCurState: Test 1, Fan present but has no cur_state present.\n\nAlso the following message when trying to change fan status.\nFan cooling_device3 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were busy.\n\nI know some may not think this is that hot of a temperature but I would like to find out what temperature the Intel gpu chip is running at and if there is a way to ensure the fan can operate a bite more if needs be.\n\nA: Here is my experience as an owner of a Clevo W560SH (it's almost the same as yours but with a slightly older and more power hungry dGPU).\nThe iGPU temperature should be the same as the CPU temperature.\nI have a SATA SSD installed and it's temp is around the same as the one in your HDD (39ºC).\nThat SSD temperature is somewhat high, but it is not unheard of. Googling for it turns up a lot of hits. Here is an example - check under \"Temperature\".\nThe cause is most likely bad airflow to the SSD.\nI have seen the inside of mine too, and in fact the SSD is located in a \"corner\".\nThe rest of the temperatures you display are also in the same range as mine.\nSo all in all, I think your system is in a healthy state.\n", "Q: Wifi not resuming after suspend Wifi worked fine on my dell inspiron e1505 with broadcom 4311 wifi. \nSince upgrading to 14.04, wifi does not work after resuming from (close-the-lid) suspend.

It didn't come preloaded with a OS so I thought it would be the best time to try out Linux. So I installed the latest Ubuntu and gave it a go. Everything is fairly solid except for the fact that the Wifi can't seem to work. The touchpad is freaking out even from swipe. Audio is also screwed.\nOddly, the bluetooth is working just fine.\nI have zero experience with and I really want to try it out. But the I'm already tripping at the starting line. Mind guiding me to finding out how I can fix this?\n\nA: I know it won't be a solution to the touchpad issue or audio, but I've used that computer (have one actually, just got a 7560 though that I use instead) and you simply need to plug into ethernet and run sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source to get the wifi working. If you are simply having problems with the touchpad moving too quickly or something then search in the dash for mouse, then adjust the touchpad speed to what you like. Hopefully I was of some help.\n\nA: To install drivers (I have seen that Aspire 4755G has NVIDIA graphics, so there will be NVIDIA drivers available to install) open the Dash (press the Super key) and launch Software & Updates. Go to Additional Drivers tab and select an NVIDIA driver (usually the one proprietary, tested). If there are WiFi drivers available install them too.\nTo tweak the Touchpad, write \"touchpad\" in the Dash and launch Mouse & Touchpad. Change the pointer speed.\nIf your unable to connect to the internet, additional drivers will not find any available drivers, so if you cannot connect through wifi, try connecting an ethernet cable.\n", "Q: How to disable PS3 accelerometers through usb, no bluetooth how do I disable the tilt accelerometers when using ps3 controller with usb?

Any help will be appreciable.\n\nA: X11 forwarding needs to be enabled on both the client side and the server side.\nOn the client side, the -X (capital X) option to ssh enables X11 forwarding, and you can make this the default (for all connections or for a specific conection) with ForwardX11 yes in ~/.ssh/config.\nOn the server side, X11Forwarding yes must specified in /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Note that the default is no forwarding (some distributions turn it on in their default /etc/ssh/sshd_config), and that the user cannot override this setting.\nThe xauth program must be installed on the server side. If there are any X11 programs there, it's very likely that xauth will be there. In the unlikely case xauth was installed in a nonstandard location, it can be called through ~/.ssh/rc (on the server!).\nNote that you do not need to set any environment variables on the server. DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY will automatically be set to their proper values. If you run ssh and DISPLAY is not set, it means ssh is not forwarding the X11 connection.\nTo confirm that ssh is forwarding X11, check for a line containing Requesting X11 forwarding in the ssh -v -X output. Note that the server won't reply either way.\nSource\n", "Q: xbmc upstart scrip delivers no sound I want xbmc to start on boot, as well as restart when it crashes. Currently, I auto-login to a user ('public') and have xbmc as a startup application. But if xbmc crashes it does not restart, which is problematic for my computer-illiterate family, if not for me personally. Since I am used to /etc/init/ scripts, I followed this guide, creating the following script (but with USER=public instead of 'xbmc'):\n# xbmc-upstart\n# starts XBMC on startup by using xinit.\n# by default runs as xbmc, to change edit below.\nenv USER=xbmc\n\ndescription     \"XBMC-barebones-upstart-script\"\nauthor          \"Matt Filetto\"\n\nstart on (filesystem and stopped udevtrigger)\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\n# tell upstart to respawn the process if abnormal exit\nrespawn\n\nscript\n  exec su -c \"xinit /usr/bin/xbmc --standalone -- -nocursor :0\" $USER\nend script\n\nIt works perfectly in the sense that the machine boots into xbmc, but now I have no sound! And when I exit xbmc, it directly restarts, which means that I cannot (that is, I do not have the skills to know how to, at least) check the sound settings from Unity.\nAdvice on how to get the sound working?\n\nA: I have found a workaround which solves the problem for me, in the sense that it:\n\n\n*\n\n*allows me to autostart in xbmc\n\n*restarts xbmc if the program crashes\n\n*it fully functioning: there is sound and the video is working perfectly.\n\n\nWhat I chose to do was to auto-start Ubuntu into my 'public' user the 'normal' GUI way by selecting the option in Unity. Then, I added a process monitor script to respawn the program for me. \nHere is how: Following this answer, I added a the following script to the home directory of user 'public', naming it 'process_monitor.sh':\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ -z \"$1\" ]];then\n    echo \"ERROR: must specify program\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nwhile (( 0 == 0 ));do\n    $@ &\n    pid=`jobs -l | awk '{print $2}'`\n    wait $pid\ndone\n\nAfter making the script executable by\nchmod a+x ~/process_monitor.sh\n\nI added the following line in \"Startup applications\" for user 'public' (accessed through Dash or, in 12.04 at least, the top right bar):\n/bin/bash ~/process_monitor.sh /usr/bin/xbmc\n\nThis way, I can now auto-start in xbmc with perfect sound and video functionality, and then have the monitor script make sure that xbmc respawns when it crashes. Perhaps not the most beautiful of solutions, but it works!\n", "Q: exports in .bashrc not working I have a program .path.py which prints an export command for PATH.

I started up the liveCD, installed mdadm, and created a RAID 1 array on a 3 TB HD.  I then restarted, went directly into the installation menu, and set up a new installation with / and swap on two partitions on the SSD, and /home on the RAID 1 array.\nThe installer seemed to have no problems with this arrangement, but upon restarting into the new installation, I'm told that \"The disk drive /home is not ready yet\".\nMy first thought was that perhaps mdadm wasn't installed on the new system, so it had no way to read the drive, but I can't imagine Ubuntu installer would recognize and install to a RAID array without including the necessary packages to read said array.  I'm not sure how to go about diagnosing this - any ideas?\nEdit:\nAfter discovering that my new installation didn't have mdadm installed on it for whatever reason, I restarted and used the manual recovery mode to get to a root terminal.  It seems like it would be possible to install mdadm from here, but I can't get an internet connection to work.  I used \"ifconfig eth0 up\" to activate the ethernet, and tried pinging with and without lo disabled, but can't seem to get a connection to stick.\n\nA: First, make sure that the mdadm package is present in the installed system (not just the live system) using apt-get install mdadm. I will assume you are doing this from a root shell, either via recovery mode or for example by invoking sudo -i, and hence none of the following commands are prefaced with an explicit sudo. If you are doing this from recovery mode, you will need to remount the root filesystem in read-write mode first i.e.\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nYou will also need a working internet connection if the package has not already been downloaded into the cache - if you have a wired ethernet connection to a router that's running a full DHCP connection, that should be possible by running\nifconfig eth0 up\n\ndhclient -v eth0\n\nAlternatively, you can try exiting back to the recovery mode menu and choosing 'Enable networking' - which should have the side effect of remounting in rw mode as well. Then\napt-get install mdadm\n\nThat should create a default /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf file, however in order for the system to assemble the array on boot, you need to append the details of your new array to that file\nmdadm --detail --scan >> /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf\n\nIt may also be necessary to write the array details to the initial ramdisk using\nupdate-initramfs -u\n\n(I think that's only strictly required if you want to boot from a RAID device, but it won't do any harm).\n", "Q: ethernet stopped working on ubuntu 14.04, still works on windows Everything was working fine on my Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit installation (on a Dell Vostro laptop) yesterday.

If resolvconf is installed and /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf then resolvconf is managing the file. In that case take a look in the files in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/ and remove any lines that look like domain home.network or search home.network.\nIf resolvconf is not managing resolv.conf then the string home.network is probably being supplied by your DHCP server.

I currently have a 1.9ghz amd processor and 4gb of ram. I'm wondering if it would actually make ubuntu ui faster if I upgraded to 8gb or is it not worth the bother with my current processor?\n\nA: Memory is used for applications to store data while they are running. Programs use memory for data they will access often, instead of reading and writing to the hard drive which is much slower. If you don't have many applications running at the same time, you will probably not reach the point where you need to use 8GB of RAM, so the extra 4GB of RAM may not have much of a noticeable effect on how fast your system runs.

Your job will be done.\ncurl -L \"http://someurl/some.tar.gz\" | tar xvzf - | zip -qr /path/to/myfile.zip -@\n\nHere file list is specified as -@, zip takes the list of input files from standard input instead of from the command line.

And it works now :-) \n\nA: Give your user account an entry in /etc/sudoers to use mount. Or you could always mount ntfs partition at boot time by adding a line to the end of /etc/fstab. First create a directory in /mnt and alter permissions and ownership using chmod and chown. Add the line to fstab, reboot and test.\nThe fstab method will be best.\nAs root or via sudo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory to mount sdc7 to.\n\n*Alter new directory's permissions and ownership.\n\n*Mount sdc7 to new directory.\n\n*Using su check that users can access the file system.\n\n*Enter command ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid, note the UUID of sdc7.\n\n*Open /etc/fstab in a text editor. Each line is a record, fields separated by tabs. Add new line reading something like:\nUUID={uuid@5} {path of @1} ntfs defaults 0 3\n\n\n*Save and reboot your system, if the boot sequence reports unable to mount... the UUID is probably wrong. \n(If you're new, commands apropos and man will help.)\n\nA: Specify the users mount option in its /etc/fstab entry.  That lets regular users mount and unmount the partition without a password.\nReference\n", "Q: How to use a .patch file? I did the instructions found in here.

It is the HID patch that can be found at the download link in that site.\n\nA: This is a kernel patch, it is used to make modifications to the kernel source code. After applying it, you would need to recompile the kernel (from the modified source code), which is not a trivial operation and which you probably don't want to do.\n\nA: I agree with fkraiem that you probably do not want to apply that patch yourself.\nThe mail thread ends saying that the fix will be in kernel version 3.15.\nThe latest standard package version available for trusty is 3.13 currently.\nThe current version for the next Ubuntu release, Utopic, is 3.16. Maybe you can just wait for Utopic, release planed for October 23rd?\n\nA: UPDATE:\nI updated my BIOS version and it made my touchpad work but after several minutes the laptop froze. What I did was to close the lid to make the laptop hibernate then open it again. It's not frozen anymore, however, the touchpad is not working anymore. It seems that ubuntu has issues with asus bios.\nThis is really not an answer to the original question. However, this is an alternative for someone with the same problem (touchpad not working).

Using \nPlayonLinux   is completely safe. \nPlayOnLinux mainly relies on WineHQ project. And according to wineHQ FAQ\n\n1.2. Does Wine hurt Linux or other free operating systems?\nWine increases the usefulness of Linux, makes it easier for users to\n  switch to free operating systems, and for Windows developers to make\n  applications that work on them.\n\nand \n\n11.2. How good is Wine at sandboxing Windows apps?\nWine does not sandbox in any way at all. When run under Wine, a\n  Windows app can do anything your user can. Wine does not (and cannot)\n  stop a Windows app directly making native syscalls, messing with your\n  files, altering your startup scripts, or doing other nasty things.\n\nWine also has a separate  Wine \"myths\" page where you can find more detail.\n\nA: The most common application in Linux to use for this purpose is either Wine and/or PlayOnLinux. \nFrom experience, using both applications for a few years now I'd say that both are equally good. Also PlayOnLinux is more GUI oriented and much easier to use for those who just get started. \nYou can also check the Wine (AppDB) - Wine Application Database, to see if the application you are attempting to install runs on your system/setup, based on other users past experiences and the same option is available for PlayOnLinux - Supported Software.\nIn the end it is best to make your own experiences and yes, it is safe to use, since both applications came a long way, are well developed and regularly attended for. \nTo install see here: Ubuntu Apps Directory\n", "Q: Install newer package version from trusty-backports In an ubuntu 14.04 system with the latest updates:\n$ ansible --version\nansible 1.5.4\n\n$ apt-cache policy ansible\nansible:\n  Installed: 1.5.4+dfsg-1\n  Candidate: 1.5.4+dfsg-1\n  Version table:\n     1.7.1+dfsg-1~ubuntu14.04.1 0\n        100 http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-backports/universe amd64     Packages\n *** 1.5.4+dfsg-1 0\n        500 http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/universe amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I install the newest version of ansible (1.7.1) from trusty-backports ? \n\n*Is it in general safe to use the packages from trusty-backports ?\n\n\nA: Found the answers here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports\nTo install:\n$ sudo apt-get install ansible/trusty-backports\n\nThe link above contains information about stability and security support for Backports.\n\nA: For newer Ubuntu versions this will fill the correct backport name for you:\nsudo apt install -t `lsb_release -cs`-backports ansible\n\nWhere -cs == --codename + --short.\n", "Q: Dual Boot System Operating System not Found (Win7/Ubunty 14.04) I read through similar problems, but nothing I found solved my particular problem. \nI used to run a dual boot WIn7/Ubuntu 14.04.

I am learning searching and I'm confused this command.\nfind -name \"*.swp\" -exec rm {} ';'\n\nCan you explain to me what this command means?\n\nA: -exec is an option of find. What's happening here is all files matching *.swp are removed one by one. {} is the full path and file name, not sure about trailing ;. But the first term of find should be a directory or path to one. To learn more at the terminal type man find. man manuals can be searched using the apropos command.\n\nA: The exec  command executes a specific command for each file found. It treats its arguments as a sub-process to execute. It is one of the most powerful and dangerous options provided by the find  command.\nWhen you execute the above command, find will search for the given pattern in the directories and sub-directories. If found, it returns the filename with the relative path from the current directory.\nFor example:\n  [guru@guru-Aspire~]$ touch temp1.swp temp2.swp temp3.swp   # Create 3 files.\n\n  [guru@guru-Aspire~]$ find -name \"*.swp\" \n  ./temp2.swp\n  ./temp3.swp\n  ./temp1.swp\n\nfind takes all arguments after -exec as part of the command until the argument ; is reached. {} is replaced with the filename searched by the find command.\nThe filename and ; is needed to be separated so that it can be protected from the expansion. So, either we can escape it using \\; or we can use or quoted  like ';'\n\nA: Rather than giving you a fish, here's how to fish: \nType this in the console: \n man find\n\nOr this (doens't work on all systems): \ninfo find\n\nAlso check this out: LDP: Bash for Beginners  and learn to distinguish between a command and it's arguments ;)\n\nA: That line simply finds files recursively (in each subdirectory of command  issued) with swp extension and removes them. \nHere is a guide :http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~kyoon/tts/unix-help/unix-find-command-examples.htm#EX02\nAnd this guide explains how to use -exec switch  with find command http://www.softpanorama.org/Tools/Find/using_exec_option_and_xargs_in_find.shtml\n", "Q: How to setup bcache?

I did but the system didn't find the /home partition upon next boot.\n\n\n*Both echo /dev/sdb2 > /sys/fs/bcache/register and echo /dev/sda2 > /sys/fs/bcache/register return 'Permission denied' messages; as I understand /sys cannot be written to.\nSo  echo /dev/sdb2 | sudo tee /sys/fs/bcache/register seems to have worked.\nCan someone verify this is the proper way to do it in Ubuntu?\nI seem to have managed to create, register and attach the backing drive but according to the tail /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/stats_total/*  I only have bypassed data.\nMy whole setup is quite a mess now so any clarification would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: With Ubuntu 15.10, alex's answer is no longer correct. The initramfs image is locked in the installer and will not be automatically re-generated when the system is installed. Thus one will have a bcache installation, but it won't be able to boot. I've written a more verbose description of the following process elsewhere; however, here are the basics:\n1. Partitioning\nBoot into the Ubuntu live-cd and create the following partition scheme with fdisk or gparted. Assuming /dev/sda is your SSD and /dev/sdb is your HDD:\n/dev/sda1 - 1024 MB, EXT4, used for /boot (grub/grub2 doesn't support bcache)\n/dev/sda2 - any format, for cache\n/dev/sdb1 - EFI partition (if your machine needs it)\n/dev/sdb2 - swap\n/dev/sdb3 - any format, backing partition\n\n2. Create the bcache device\nOpen up the terminal, wipe the file systems on the backing and caching device:\nsudo wipefs -a /dev/sda2\nsudo wifefs -a /dev/sdb3\n\nInstall bcache-tools and create the bcache device:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bcache-tools\nsudo make-bcache -B /dev/sdb3 -C /dev/sda2\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/bcache0\n\n3. Install Ubuntu\nInstall the operating system using the custom partitioner as follows:\n/dev/bcache0 - format EXT4, use as /\n/dev/sda1    - format EXT4, use as /boot\n/dev/sdb1    - EFI partition (if your machine needs it)\n/dev/sdb2    - swap\n\nDO NOT REBOOT after the installer completes!\n4. Install bcache on the new installation\nUsing a chroot we install bcache-tools on the new installation.\nSetup the environment and enable DNS resolution\nsudo mount /dev/bcache0 /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nFor Ubuntu 17.10 or newer you also need to copy over the resolv.conf file\nso DNS resolution works within the chroot environment.\nsudo mv /mnt/etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf.backup\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf\n\nEnter into the chroot and do the installation\nsudo chroot /mnt\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bcache-tools\n\nDuring the installation you should notice the initramfs is re-generated and installed to the (chroot-ed) /boot partition.\n5. Cleanup\nCleanly dismount the filesystem and reboot.\nexit\nsudo mv /mnt/etc/resolv.conf.backup /mnt/etc/resolv.conf # for 17.10+ only\nsudo umount /mnt/sys\nsudo umount /mnt/proc\nsudo umount /mnt/dev\nsudo umount /mnt/boot\nsudo umount /mnt\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: After some trial and error I've arrived at the following solution for a clean install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition the HDD the way you like (assuming /dev/sdb2 is the space you want for your /home).\n\n*# apt-get install bcache-tools\n\n*# make-bcache -B /dev/sdb2 -C /dev/sda2  (This creates /dev/bcache0, but the UI installer can't use it yet.)\n\n*# mkfs.ext4 /dev/bcache0  (This makes the installer see a \"partition /dev/bcache0\" under \"device /dev/bcache0\" and allows you to use it as \"/home\" during installation.)\n\n*Run the installer as usual, be sure to select advanced disk partition options.\n\n*The installer creates initrd image with the bcache kernel module included and loaded due to that we've installed bcache-tools earlier, so after reboot it just works.\n\n*After booting the installed system, install bcache-tools once again, so that further updates don't cripple the boot process by omitting the necessary bcache kernel module from initrd image.\n\n\nA: I too tried and failed many times till I found these instructions:\nhttp://www.wdong.org/wordpress/blog/2014/05/28/installing-ubuntu-14-04-to-bcache/\nThey sound somewhat hairy but this is probably the only feasible way to get bcache going, at least until bcache becomes part of the ubuntu installer.\nThe only curious omission in the instructions is the very last stage.\nAfter you've done everything, look up the UUID of the cache set in /sys/fs/bcache and do this: \necho <UUID> > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/attach\n\nIf you'd like to enable writeback mode (which I'd strongly recommend):\necho writeback > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/cache_mode\n\ncatting various files in /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/ will tell you all about how the cache is running. I set up my system using these instructions on July 26th this year and everything is running perfectly since. cat /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/stats_total/cache_hit_ratio shows a highly satisfactory 88 per cent and subjectively, the machine feels like an all-SSD setup.\n", "Q: How to change an order of mount points if a volume is mounted twice?

It may be important, as I suspect that some software (like file managers) get the FIRST mount point and associates this one with the volume label.\n\nA: One solution could be to mount Folder_1 on Folder_2, instead of mounting the device on Folder_2, using bind mounts:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/Folder_1\nsudo mount -o bind /media/Folder_1 /media/Folder_2\n\nThis way, the device is never mounted on the second folder, but all its files are visible there.\n\nA: You can give a pass number in /etc/fstab. The higher the number the later it'll mount.\n", "Q: vim NERDTree | Auto fresh the directory pane How can you auto refresh the directory panes automatically in vim NERDTree?

The problem is that I'm able to go into Ubuntu and test it like a live CD, but when I'm trying to install it, it gets stuck on the install screen.\n\nDo you know why I'm getting stuck? Is there any way to create a log file to upload here and see what's going on?\n\nA: If you get to the install screen it means that everything is OK. Normally such failures mean that the ISO image wasn't correctly downloaded. I would suggest to download it again and check the MD5sum of both media, that's easy : Just open a terminal and type \nmd5 whateverfile.iso\n\n(Works in the same way in Linux, OS X or whatever proper operating system you can think of).\nAnother thing you may want to do during installation is to jump to one of the shells that are open, one of them shows the logs and there you can see what happens, this is doen with ALT+F1 and using the F-keys to switch between terminals (F6 to go back to the X server).\nOR, you can open a terminal and do: \ndmesg | less -F \n\nOR \ntail -F /var/log/messages\n\nBTW: The last command can also come handy for debugging issues on Mavericks,it will show you the last lines of the logs in real-time.\n", "Q: How to compute date for touch -t How to create date type in bash?\nwhat this date mean?

I switched to the openGL libraries, and all  I get is a black screen.\nThe game is notorious for longer load times (some are calling the game unplayable) but most of the topics I found on their official website relate to joining a server or switching between maps; these bugs only apply to the linux players, and they seem to be across all different flavors of linux. There does not seem to be an official fix for their problems, let alone  mine.\nPerhaps there is a different bottleneck somewhere else. Here are my system specs:\n1TB sata HDD\n8 gigs ram\nIntell 8-core, single thread per core processor\nKubuntu 14.04\nAMD 7770 HD graphics card\nHere is what I've tried so far:\nSwitching between graphics drivers already on my system (for some reason, I have three - including the openGL ones? How does that even work?) Result - different graphics drivers gave different results. The open GL driver performed the worst, giving just a black screen. The updated flgrx proprietary driver was the slowest, stopping two seconds after the loading screen came up, and the -NOT- updated one stopped after five or six seconds.\npurging the proprietary drivers for my graphics card, then re installing openGL libraries; Result - seemingly none. I am noticing absolutely NO change to my system or the game loading times. However, the proprietary drivers for my graphics card are still there; after this, I tried switching back and forth between drivers again and have the same thing going on as the first thing I tried!\nI would like to try the Mesa driver, but I am unsure which packages to install. I had some weird issues with graphics when I first built my system and it took my fiance a good five hours just to get my GUI up and running - I don't want to put him through that again. \"sudo apt search mesa\" in Konsole returns a crap-storm of text. Which is the correct one(s)? Are there any other things I can try? (I'm not even sure how to pinpoint my bottleneck in kubuntu...)\nThere is one other thing I noticed: I am running a 64 bit os. I think my game might be a 32 bit piece of software. Does this matter? If so, how do I fix it?\n\nA: I don't know if I got that right:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are using Steam for Linux.\n\n*You bought Natural Selection 2 from the Steam store.\n\n*The game gets stuck at a certain point, not loading anymore levels/content/etc.\n\n*\n\n*This is a bug in the game or some kind of copy protection (which we can rule out since you bought the game from the Steam store and you wouldn't get help here otherwise)\n\n*⇨ Contact the game manufacturer.\n\n\n*The game shows poor performance where the hardware is usually capable of delivering playable performance (e.g. the same game with the same quality settings runs fine on Windows).\n\n*\n\n*This is a bug in the game programming or the driver.\n\n*Switching to another driver will not improve performance. Generally if there are up to date proprietary drivers available, then these should achieve a performance similar to the Windows drivers and have all the fixes for stable gameplay.\n\n*⇨ Contact the game or driver manufacturer.\n\n\n\n… running flawed closed source program code on Linux instead of Windows doesn't magically make it better, but probably worse.\n", "Q: changing Apache2 web directory. 403 forbidden In fact I just want to change the web directory to another folder in Ubuntu, but \n403 forbidden error give a mass to me.\nI have tried a lot of ways on google to solve this problem, but those solutions can not solve my problem, such as change the permission of the folder,\nThis is /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf file (see comments on lines with ##############):\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n\n# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that\n# the server uses to identify itself.

Because the desktop distro will be running in the chrooted environment \"on top\" of the android OS (which controls the screen), it doesn't have a way a way to access the screen directly.\nYou're using VNC not because you need to access a screen remotely, but because you need to create a virtual screen.\n", "Q: Tamil phonetic typing The methods described to turn on phonetic typing is not worked in Ubuntu 14.04.

For Debian/Ubuntu packages, the idea is that the package builds and contains the binaries and rules for where to install them.  There are debian/PACKAGENAME.install files which you use to define where executables are installed.  That is of course assuming you have the binaries compiled and ready to move into their correct locations on disk when the package is installed.\nLook towards the end of that file here:\nmake[2]: Entering directory `/build/buildd/konzolno-radio-1.0.3'\ninstalling executable file to /usr/local/bin\ninstall: cannot create regular file '/usr/local/bin/konzolno-radio': Permission denied\nmake[2]: *** [install] Error 1\nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/build/buildd/konzolno-radio-1.0.3'\nmake[1]: *** [override_dh_auto_install] Error 2\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/build/buildd/konzolno-radio-1.0.3'\nmake: *** [binary] Error 2\ndpkg-buildpackage: error: /usr/bin/fakeroot debian/rules binary gave error exit status 2\n\nThe problem you have is your package is trying to actually install the file to /usr/local/bin during compile.

Mods: this question is not a duplicate of others. While related in subject, this question is not a general specifications request, nor is it concerned with building kernels and whatnot. This question concerns the cause(s) of a degredation of performance on a netbook, and what remedies might be available.\nMy netbook:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gateway NAV50\n\n*Processor: Intel Atom CPU N450 166Ghz x2\n\n*Memory: 991.4 MiB\n\n*OS type: 32 bit\n\n*Disk: 245.0 GB\n\n*Graphics: Intel IGD X86/MMX/SSE2\n\n*Chrome: Version 37.0.2062.94 Ubuntu 14.04 (290621)\n\n\n(BTW, with regards to the processor, I don't know what the \"x2\" means. Two chips? Twice the speed?)\nOut of the box, this computer ran Windows 7. I replaced Win7 with Ubuntu 12.xx. It was not a dual-boot situation. I completely removed Win7, leaving Linux/Ubuntu as the only OS/desktop on the machine.\nA few weeks ago, Ubuntu automatically upgraded to 14.04. so, that's the system on my computer now.\nEven prior to the upgrade, I had noticed degraded performance. The various tasks and programs would perform without error, but they would respond slowly. Bootup takes more than 60 seconds. The time between clicking the Chrome icon in the taskbar and the launch of the program is 30 seconds or longer. The loading of the startup tabs can be equally as long. In the browser, new pages load, and load, and load, forever before all elements finally are present. Even swapping between programs (alt+tab) is a slow-motion experience, with one program slowly fading from view as the other program window slowly fades into view, instead of an instantaneous snap from one window to the other.\nThere is a general lack of \"snappiness\" to the response to commands. Every launch of a program or app involves a spongy lag time that I don't experience on my Windows-based Dell XPS or Chrome-based Nexus 5.\nMy netbook has little beyond Ubuntu loaded on it, no graphics- or video-editing programs. I don't store my photos or music on this machine, and at most keep a dozen or so text documents on the drive. I store most of my files in the cloud or on an external drive.\nI did not notice this laggy performance when I first replaced Windows with Ubuntu 12.xx. The response at that time was just as quick and immediate as it had been under Windows, from which I concluded that this machine, humble as it is, has the power necessary to handle Ubuntu. The draggy performance became evident only much later. So now I'm left to wonder what is causing it, and what I might be able to do to improve performance.\nThank you.\n\nA: Well, Ubuntu 14.04 is quite more resource intensive than many previous releases. I think with your specs, you are pushing the envelope when it comes to speed. I've used an Acer Aspire One (with the N455 Atom) the only problems I had were incompatibilities with with the Intel GMA. Ubuntu also runs a lot better with a minimum of 2GB of RAM.

The search is to find any shortcuts you might have set in the past that could work as one of those keys. \nWhat I would try to find directions:\n\n\n*\n\n*does this happen as well if you choose \"search\" from the menu? \n\n*does it happen as well if you search with Control_R+F? \n\n*did you ever use xdotools to set up key combinations, or made special key combinations in System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts?\n\n\nTry and see if any of these can give you a clue, look into System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts, disable all and see if the problem is fixed.

I read the adduser and addgroup manpages and the question here about \"users\" and \"system users\".\nI need clarification with groups and system groups, because as far as I know, groups can't login, so the \"can't login\" particularity of system users does not seem to make sense for groups. \n\nA: There is no inherent difference between system groups and 'normal' groups, just like there is none between system users and regular users. It is by convention that human users are assigned uids from a certain number (e.g. 1000) upwards, whereas system users get uids in a range below that number.\nThe actual uid number, apart from the special uid 0 which is reserved for root, has no meaning at all and does not convey any privileges.\nWe distinguish system users and regular users only because they are treated differently. For instance, there is no point in displaying system users in a graphical login manager. Also, most system users don't need a login shell or home directory, whereas human users (normally) do. \nThe --system option of the adduser command is no more than a convenience for the administrator, as it presets a number of options to sensible values for a 'system account'. In fact, the whole adduser command is a convenience wrapper around (lower level commands like useradd and groupadd, which are wrappers around) essentially just editing /etc/passwd and /etc/group.\n", "Q: exercise on ACL from computer security course You found this file lying on a system:\n[user@localhost]$ ls -la executable \n-rwsr-xr-x 1 foo group 41836 2012-10-14 19:19 dangerous.exe\nDo you notice anything wrong?\n\nA: \nI've written an answer, but this seems like a \"homework\" question. I don't consider that bad, but I do suggest providing details about what\n  you have figured out so far when asking such questions. This can both\n  get you  most useful answers, and assist you in combining pedagogical\n  benefits intended by the instructor with those afforded by Internet\n  communities--for example, by informing us about what you have and have not\n  yet learned, or by making it so you can still figure out some of the\n  solution yourself.\n\nACL stands for Access Control List. The problem here seems to relate to ordinary Unix-style permissions (see also FilePermissions), and not to ACLs. Specifically, this is an exercise about setuid executables, and about the executable permission bits for the  group and other classes. (If this is an exercise you're currently working on, that might be enough of a clue for you to solve it.)\nWhy do I think this is not (also) about ACLs? There's no information about ACLs set on the file, in the output of ls -l. Even if there is an ACL-related problem with dangerous.exe, there's no information given that would point to or otherwise suggest it.\nFurthermore, at least in Ubuntu, ls checks if a file's permissions are customized through an ACL, and if so, appends + to the end of the symbolic permissions string.\nek@Ilex:~$ ls -l foobar                  # no + in the output of ls\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ek ek 0 Sep 14 13:16 foobar\nek@Ilex:~$ setfacl -m g:adm:r foobar\nek@Ilex:~$ ls -l foobar                  # now there's a + in the output\n-rw-rw-r--+ 1 ek ek 0 Sep 14 13:16 foobar\n(Note, though, that there may be some Unix-like systems with different ACL implementations and/or where the default ls executable does not check for the presence of ACL rules on files.)\nFor more information on ACLs in Ubuntu, see FilePermissionsACLs. As for the other issues, detailed analysis follows.\n\nFirst, some commentary about what is contrived about the problem, to help us keep in mind the sorts of things that are ordinary in exercises but shouldn't be ignored if encountered \"in the field.\"\nIn real life, though this is unlikely what the exercise was focused on:\n\n\n*\n\n*A user called foo on a production system is odd.\n(Though perhaps it belongs to Fordham Oo, Jr.)\nAnd, more extremely, a user called user (as indicated in $PS1) is basically never a good idea.\nThese names will likely be interpreted metasyntactically in communication between colleagues, and may even be accidentally seen that way late at night by a system administrator who's struggling with a mostly unrelated problem.\n\n*Similarly, a group called group is basically never a good idea.\n\n*A file called dangerous.exe whose history I don't know about is alarming. It's either improperly named or maybe it shouldn't be lying around.\nNow for what will, in this situation, usually be main security-related concern.\nIn both real life and probably in the mind of whoever wrote the question:\n\n\n*\n\n*The s in -rwsr-xr-x means dangerous.exe is a setuid executable. This can be done with chmod:\nek@Ilex:~$ ls -l dangerous.exe \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 ek ek 0 Sep 14 12:29 dangerous.exe\nek@Ilex:~$ chmod u+s dangerous.exe\nek@Ilex:~$ ls -l dangerous.exe\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 ek ek 0 Sep 14 12:29 dangerous.exe\nSince dangerous.exe is setuid, it runs as its owner no matter who executes it. Occasionally this is appropriate, but unless used sparingly and carefully it can cause very serious security problems, facilitating undesired access to the account who owns the executable.\n\n*But that's not all. We know this is especially likely to be a case where a security problem could arise. (If there are any users or services running on the system that ought to be prevented from doing things foo is able to do, that is. Which is likely. Remember that a system with just one human user will by default have other user accounts are used by the system to perform actions with reduced privileges.)\nThis is due to the other permissions set on dangerous.exe. Because of the way its executable bits are set, anyone can execute dangerous.exe!\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 foo group 41836 2012-10-14 19:19 dangerous.exe\n      |   \\\n      \\    This x indicates all users other than foo and members of\n       \\   'group' may execute the file! That's almost definitely bad!\n        \\\n          This x indicates anyone in the 'group' group may execute the\n          file. Depending on what the 'group' group means and who's in\n          it, that might be bad.\nHow do we know this by inspecting -rwsr-xr-x 1 foo group 41836 2012-10-14 19:19 dangerous.exe? After the first character (which is - for normal files, d for directories, and l for symbolic links) come nine characters.\nThe first three say if the user who owns the file can read, write, and execute it. (A - appears when the answer is no.) The next group of three say if members of the file's group owner, other than the user owner, can read, write, and execute it. And the final group of three say if if other users, who neither own the file nor are in its group owner, can read, write, and execute it.\nTherefore all users on the system can run dangerous.exe--and when they do, they are running it as foo rather than as themselves!\n\n*For a file to be safely setuid (or setgid), it must be carefully written to ensure it can only be used to engage in appropriate actions. For example, the /usr/bin/passwd executable that runs when a user changes their password with the passwd command is setuid, and owned by root, so even when a limited user runs it, it runs as root. This is necessary, for it to make changes to the password database. But it's carefully written so that it will only make authorized changes.\nDepending on what privileges foo has on the system, this is likely a less severe problem than if a root-owned setuid executable had a bug that allowed it to be used in unintended ways. But it still is cause for alarm.\nIf you were a system administrator in this situation, you may wish to consult with the user foo to see if the permissions they've set on dangerous.exe were a mistake. (Depending on the context and other elements of the situation, you might potentially take more immediate action.)\n", "Q: Installing Xen Hypervisor on Ubuntu 14.04 I would like to try out the Xen Hypervisor and have been following this guide:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen\nI'm stuck at the part about the partition.  \nHow do I go about setting up the partitions correctly during the install of Ubuntu to get it ready for Xen?

I am new to open source OS, and I am trying to install Ubuntu. I've heard it's pretty user-friendly and is a good OS in general. I searched for a while on different OS, and this was the one I wanted in replacement to Windows 8, as it is slow and altogether confusing and crappy. When I saved the Ubuntu file to start installation I waited for the save and when it was finished I opened it. When I tried to open it a warning popped up telling me Corrupted File. I was wondering if this was Windows trying to stop me from getting a new OS, there were missing pieces because the save was interrupted, or just a common error and I may have to try again.\nThanks, That guy who wants to get an open source OS yet is entirely new to it and just wants to replace the crap that is Windows 8 on his computer\n\nA: What you downloaded should have been a disk image file called an ISO, with .iso extension. This is not a program you can execute. You need to load ubuntu on to your machine from a cd, which you create using the .iso file you downloaded. I do not know how to burn an ISO from Windows 8 (i don't like it either!) but its very easy from Windows 7, so I assume its not much different in W8. Google for \"burn an iso file windows 8\" and follow the instructions. You are going to want to keep this CD, as its also your recovery media, and has some very useful utilities as well.\nWhen you have burned the .iso, which is not the same as copying the file onto the CD, you need to put it in your CD drive, and reboot your machine. Most PC's will attempt to boot from it automatically. At this point, ubuntu boots from the CD, has a look at your system, and asks you what you want to do. Some PC's will not automatically boot from the CD, and need to have the boot order changed in the BIOS, which is also pretty easy, but subject of a different question.\nIf you do not have a CD burner, this can also be done from a USB key, but either way, you need to make a bootable disk or key, not install from Windows.\n", "Q: How can I install python-dev off apt-get?

After doing this, I restarted and I was greeted with the \"Reboot and select proper boot device\". \nKnowing I had screwed up, I looked up the problem and arrived to the conclusion that I had nuked the EFI partition that basically held the boot loader.

Unpackaged cruft below /lib/modules/$KVERS will be nuked. Neither the currently running-, nor the newest kernels will be offered for removal.\nMaintainer: Alf Gaida agaida@siduction.org\nSource: http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/fullstory/kernel-remover\nTo install kerml-remover, download these files:\nhttp://mirror.lug.udel.edu/pub/siduction/base/pool/main/c/creativecommons3/creativecommons3_1.1_all.deb\nhttp://mirror.lug.udel.edu/pub/siduction/base/pool/main/k/kernel-remover/kernel-remover_3.1.11_all.deb\nInstall them by Gdebi, to resolve dependencies. \nOpen a terminal.\nRun it:\nsudo -i\napt-get install gdebi\n\nRun file manager.\nClick right button --- Choose instal with gdebi, first creativecommons3_1.1_all.deb.\nRun kernel-remover.\n\nA: I just wanted to add that it is simpler to find out what is unused and CAN be removed by running purge without any parameters\nsudo apt-get remove --purge\n\nthen run using what was listed above as unused, e.g.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge linux-image-4.15.0-43-generic\n\n", "Q: where is logind.conf in 12.04?

In the past, when I've wanted to do something like this, I've followed this formula:\nsudo apt-get build-dep <package>\napt-get source <package>\ncd <package-dir>\npatch -Np1 < ../<patch>\ndch -i\ndpkg-source --commit\ndebuild -us -uc\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i <new.deb>\n\nAnd for patching Wine in the past, it worked like a charm. For my current project, I managed to get all the way through and rebuild the packages, but when I went to install the new ones, I got:\ndpkg: error processing package libvorbis0a:amd64 (--install):\n package libvorbis0a:amd64 1.3.2-1.3ubuntu2 cannot be configured because libvorbis0a:i386 is at a different version (1.3.2-1.3ubuntu1)\n\nI was going to try uninstalling the 32-bit package, as I'm not sure I really need it, but that was going to break dependencies for a whole lot of things. How can I modify my procedure (or rerun it) to also build the 32-bit versions of the package for parallel installation? Is it possible?\nEdit: I tried apt-get source libvorbis:i386, but got:\nE: Can not find a package for architecture 'i386'\nE: Unable to find a source package for libvorbis:i386\n\nEdit 2: apt-get source libvorbis0a:i386 appeared to work, but I just ended up with 64-bit packages again.\n\nA: After poking around I found out that you can't do what you need to do despite multiarch goodness, at least not without installing tons of packages and/or creating a chrooted environment.\nLuckily seems that buildbots and maintainers needs to do this, so there are a couple of tools that could serve this propose. I'm going to use pbuilder, for two reasons, it's available in Debian main repositories, ergo Ubuntu', and is automated creation of a clean ecosystem which can be updated/deleted/maintained at whim without touching your main system apart of it's flexibility. Maybe after a while I would write about the cross-toolchain.\nSo, start by installing the pbuilder and ubuntu-dev-tools packages and after that run pbuilder-dist trusty i386 create (you can also specify the target release using --distribution trusty, for example). Now, depending of your download and system speed this could take a while. After ending, you should be able to create any package using just the following:\npbuilder-dist trusty i386 libvorbis_1.3.2-1.4.dsc\n\nYou can change trusty for any other available version. It would generate a i386 version of your package.\n", "Q: Is this a bad wireless card?

But when the Windows 7 live usb loaded. It gave me the following error\nWindows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.\nTo fix the problem:\n\n1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.\n2. choose your language settings, and click \"next\"\n3.

Then this time, make sure to have enough partition spaces.  \n\n*Then install the Windows first, then install the Linux the main reason is if you install Windows first, then Linux GRUB loader still can detect Windows, but if you install Linux first, Windows will overwrite, to solve this problem, you have to use any Linux Live CD to boot into your Linux partition and then update your GRUB loader. After that you can see both OSs in your system. :)\n\nA: I got the same problem and solve by:\nStep 1. remove efi partition when \"where do you want install windows\" window come out.

The fact that, In my Lab, one of the user who is in sodoers list has changed the root password, is there any way to reveal the password he has set? I know how to change it by editing from GRUB but what if I want to know what's the previous password.\n\nA: It is a vast topic to discuss on. But considering the case of Ubuntu, the passwords are stored in the location \n /etc/shadow\n\nYou can view the contents by opening it with \n sudo nano /etc/shadow\n\nOn the very first line you can see\nroot:$6$xrzOs5vu$gfLwd1NVOBRqCvmgpBOa9V4PzNOzlgC2jGU.GT8k9zPiW2zihymU/nmgdjsP8SzR3Qk7UoQUkTrsi9tCIFy6f.:16303:0:99999:7:::\n\nThe first part is the username (Here it is root. You can see other users below). Then comes the hashed form of your root password. Usually once we assign a password to ubuntu, It generates a random salt value and add this salt value to the password file and then hashes it using any of the algorithms like sha512,md5,etc. Since the salt is unknown it is very hard for a cracker to crack the passwords. But you still can change your root password by simply typing the following on terminal\nsudo passwd\n\n\nA: There isn't a way to decrypt the password.  Historically, the encryption of Unix passwords has always been irreversible because the encryption is not unique to the password.  There may be other passwords that will generate the same encryption string.  Because of this, decryption to a single password is impossible.  Unix takes the password that you enter at login, encrypts it, and compares the encryptions to see if you entered the correct password.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 updater not working This is the error I keep on getting when I try to update anything.\nIgn cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal InRelease\nIgn cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal Release.gpg\nIgn cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal Release\nErr cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal/main amd64 Packages\n  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nErr cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal/restricted amd64 Packages\n  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nErr cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal/main i386 Packages\n  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nErr cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal/restricted i386 Packages\n  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nIgn cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal/main Translation-en_US\nIgn cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal/main Translation-en\nIgn cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal/restricted Translation-en_US\nIgn cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5) quantal/restricted Translation-en\nIgn http://archive.ubuntu.com quantal InRelease                                \nGet:1 http//repo.steampowered.com precise InRelease [2,840 B]                                    \nErr http//archive.ubuntu.com quantal-updates/main Sources\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.13 80]\nErr http://archive.ubuntu.com quantal-updates/restricted Sources\n\nIgn http//archive.ubuntu.com quantal-security/main Translation-en_US\n\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5)/dists/quantal/main/binary-amd64/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n\nW: Failed to fetch http:/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.13 80]\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

You have configured the build to use a prefix and bindir to install it in your $HOME.\nTo make the package avaiable to other programs it would be better to choose directories outside of your $HOME. Then you will need to do the make install using sudo.\n\nA: It depends upon where your package is going to be install. \nDuring installation you need to enter sudo if you are performing installation in the system directories like /usr. You are needed to enter this because you do not have the write permission in that directory. A local install will not require sudo before make install\n\nA: As an addendum, consider using checkinstall to generate a managed package, then installing it with dpkg or another apt tool. For installing software from source this can relieve many headaches when it comes time to upgrade, remove, or resolve problems.\n\nA: The guide you are following assumes that you wish to install ffmpeg to ~/bin/ in your HOME direcetory. This has the advantage of not needing sudo for installing but we will not be able to use ffmpeg system-wide from all users. \nIn addition, this path does not exist in a default Ubuntu installation, where self-compiled sytem-wide software should preferably go to /opt. See What is the best place to install user apps?.\nIn case we need to have access to ffmpeg from all users we should use an installation path outside our HOME for make install. This of course then requires sudo for installing. See also FFmpeg Compilation Guide.\n\nA: If you are in doubt, almost certainly the answer is you should not use sudo. \nEach time you try sudo make install you expose your system to potential bugs, as root.\nI am a practicing sysadmin and regularly need to setup software for third parties;\nunless there is something that is truly system-aspect (such as a kernel module),\nmost of the software gets installed and lives happily in user-space, even when shared by many, by employing ./configure --prefix\nfi. >1000 software components visible here are all setup under a single regular user:\nhttps://hpc.uni.lu/users/software/\nExample:\n\n\n*\n\n*CUDA is a GPU development environment provided by nVidia; that's installed without sudo\n\n*nVidia GPU drivers though, need lower level access and thus, are done via sudo/root\n\n", "Q: Difference between these two methods of downloading linux source code System info:\nroot@zaidi:/home/uzair# uname -a\nLinux zaidi 3.11.0-26-generic #45~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 04:04:35 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n\nI am trying to write a simple device driver.

Does anybody know of a way?\n\nA: When you download some executable package from the internet, by default it does not have executable permission.\nTo make you program execute, you need to assign executable permission to it.\nTo assign executable permissio to your file\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal and goto to the directory where file is downloaded. for example cd ~/Downloads.\n\n*Now aasign executable permission to the file using chmod +x filename\n\n*Now run it using ./filename\n\nA: Try chmod +x your-executable-file.\n", "Q: Binary archives of OpenJDK for ubuntu My goal is to have multiple version of java 6 and multiple version of java 7 installed on my ubuntu in order to do some tests with different versions of java.\nI found instructions to install oracle jdk/jre manually and it works fine.\nHowever I don't know where to find archives for openjdk for ubuntu.\nAre they available anywhere?\n\nA: Getting the jdk from oracle here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html is essentially the same as from elsewhere.

On some searching around, I came to know that bash disables history in non-interactive shells by default, but we can turn it on. So after editing I tried the following code :-\n#!/bin/bash\nHISTFILE=~/.bash_history   # Or wherever you bash history file lives\nset -o history             # enable history\nhistory\nhistory -c\n\nIt shows the output :-\n[root@localhost lib]# bash a.sh\n1  history\n[root@localhost lib]#\n\nAnd besides that the hisory -c command did not work. Because I am still getting the history of commands when I type history. This means both history and history -c didnt work inside the bash script.\nHow should we use it then?\nEDIT 1- I want to delete the history of the current session, it must be stored somewhere.

So I decided to make the switch to Ubuntu to wipe everything, and I’m quite enjoying the change.\nBut I'm still quite paranoid about any possible rootkit infection. I had to download and burn a Ubuntu install CD from my infected laptop at the time, I have a feeling this probably wasn't the best idea but it's my only computer.\nI completely wiped the hard drive when installing ubuntu, but I keep reading about rootkits that reside in the kernel or the network card. Is there anyway to check if my laptop is still infected?\n\nA: First of all, welcome to a free world. Second, yes, there is still a possibility that the hardware you have is infected, as you did not explain where or how you \"wiped everything\" on the drive. Rootkits that reside at the hardware layer (if you were truly infected with Rootkits, it is important to know which rootkit was installed and where in the system) are much harder to remove from the system and may require replacement of hardware if the rootkit was installed at the firmware layer.\nI point you to the wikipedia article which explains some of this, and might be beneficial herein. There are numerous rootkit detectors, but the effectiveness is always subject to the ability to truly detect malware and where/when the rootkit is loaded. If loaded in firmware, suspect that you need new equipment.\nIt is much harder to infect or attack Linux system due to the diversity of installations, partitioning and methods of securing the instances. There is no \"single model\" approach, which is why the level of difficulty is significantly more challenging to attack. Not that it is impossible, it is possible, but rather it may not bring the same \"bang for the buck\" that malware authors want to focus on.\nSince we do not know what rootkit was installed, where it was installed and what it effected on the system, I would treat it as \"untrustworthy\" as you do not know where the rootkit lie in the system.\nDarik's Boot and Nuke is perhaps the best hard-drive wiping tool that you can choose, but it takes patience to allow it to completely wipe the drive. This still does not insure that any rootkit that may have infected firmware is removed though. The likelihood of a Windows rootkit compromising a Linux system is pretty slim to none, unless it was written into the firmware, BIOS or other pre-boot hardware that gives it full control over the system regardless of the OS installed.\nMy advice would be to have the system examined by someone who really understands same, and figure out how that rootkit was installed and prevent that avenue of access from recurring. \nAs for Linux, chkrootkit, rkhunter, maldetect and other offerings exist (some commercial). They help prevent and detect malware and rootkits, and they are generally effective. However, having stated that I would not start with known bad hardware unless I was certain of totally ridding myself of the rootkit first, and event then, I would replace the drive as it is always suspect.\nDo hope this is helpful information.

To stop just anybody or anything overwriting, deleting or maliciously editing your core system configuration.\nSome applications (like the authentication and sudo systems) demand that these files are kept securely and won't function if you fight that.\nSomebody with enough expertise could probably fix this... But it's an uphill struggle from the off. You need to get into recovery mode, and reset all the files permissions back to what they were. And, no they weren't all the same.\nFor somebody closer to the novice end of the scale, a reinstall is the recommended course of action.

Adobe will continue to provide security backports to Flash Player 11.2 for Linux.\n\nSome search on the web like \"Ubuntu Adobe Flash 15\" or similar does not return any good websites.\nI found something that says Google's Chrome Browser should do the job  (using a \"pepper-based version\"), and  for Chromium there is an ppa. \nIs it impossible to use this for Firefox too? Would it be a privacy risk?\nAre there no alternative projects (I know it's closed source but there are so many so very bright people out there using something similar to wine but just for the plugin....)?\nHow about the Mac-Version? Shouldn't someone be able to port that one to Linux?\n\nA: Flash player is completely dead for all operating systems as of 2021.\nInstall the latest version of flash player\nThese instructions will install the latest version of flash player for Chromium and it will also be updated automatically.

I am in the planning stage for setting up my server and have some doubts.\nFirstly my network is something like this:\nOne parent PC connected to the internet and 3 other child PCs which are not connected to the internet but connected to the parent PC by LAN. The parent PC has its own UPS while the 3 child PCs share another UPS (so in all there are 2 UPS only).\nMy concern is that in case of power outage I want the parent PC to remain on using the UPS, but I want the child PCs to shutdown immediately. When the electricity is back I want the 3 child PCs to turn on again. How do I control the child PCs from the parent PC using automated software?\nAll the PCs will be running Ubuntu server.\nThis is the only server that I have.\n\nA: First of all this seems to be a very interesting project. As far as I know most modern UPS have a USB connection to provide a shutdown signal to the connected computer. You could analyze the signal your UPS might provide you. To control the three child server you could send a shutdown command via ssh (pub key authentication) upon power loss.\nMaybe there is another plug-and-play device that could monitor your power plugs voltage and send it's data to the parent server if the first option is not working. \nIf there is no such device listed above and your UPS don't provide a signal cable, the only way I see is \"hacking\" the UPS itself and grab some electrical signal that could trigger a Raspberry Pi port which shuts down your machines via ssh. \nBut be carefull because you are dealing with high voltages and high currents that can do lethal harm if they are not treated with extreme caution. \nTo boot up the machines again you should look into your BIOS. Most modern Motherboards have the WakeOnLan function which powers the computer up if a correspinding signal is recieved via LAN.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server compiling kernel modules I am trying to compile paragon ntfs driver http://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-linux-per/screenshots.html and got “no symbol version for module_layout\" error when modprobe loading modules.\nAccording to answer \"no symbol version for module_layout\" when trying to load usbhid.ko I should have the same versions of linux-source, linux-headers and running kernel.\nI have Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS  uname -r 3.8.0-44-generic, but no linux-source-3.8.0-44 and linux-headers-3.8.0-44 in repositary. \nWhere i can got linux-source-3.8.0-44 and linux-headers-3.8.0-44?\nThanks\nKonstantin\n\nA: You can install this from the precise repo, 3.8 was the default kernel on 12.04.\nYou're on 14.04, thus your sources.lst points towards trusty:\nEither download the packages from here and install then using dpkg -i <pkgname>\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/linux-headers-3.8.0-44\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/linux-headers-3.8.0-44-generic\nor add the old repo to your sources.lst and install from there.\nSearching on http://packages.ubuntu.com doesn't yield results for linux-source... though.\n", "Q: installing ns2 in ubuntu when I give this command \napt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libxmu-dev\n\nit gives the following error\nE: Package 'build-essential' has no installation candidate\nE: Package 'autoconf' has no installation candidate\nE: Package 'automake' has no installation candidate\nE: Unable to locate package libxmu-dev\n\n\nA: Try to first enable the main repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main\"\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAnd finally:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libxmu-dev\n\n", "Q: Control + D not working in mail I am trying to test the mail capabilities of my server.

The p4p1 interface is my connection to the internet and gets its adress via DHCP from my provider.\nwlan0 and p5p1 are connected to a bridge br0 which uses the static adress 192.168.3.1. Both indiviual interfaces have no adress. dnsmaq assignes each device at br0 to an ip adress. I used this guide to set up my router.\nI'm able to reach the internet from both LAN and WIFI. It is also possible to ping each device from the servers console. But i am not able to connect from one part of the network to another.

Hope this helps\n\nA: I had a similar problem,\nsince I couldn´t find an answer for my problem I started synaptic and erased \"alsa-base\" and \"alsa-utils\". Reboot, no background sound anymore. Heaven. Hope it works\n\nA: I haven't addressed the root of the problem, but just kind of made it a virtually unnoticable.\nSo, the hack is quite simple. As the problem persists only when there is no playback, I came up with a hack to always have a playback!\nNow, this should be true only when the headphones are connected. And the playback should stop when headphones are removed.\nFollow these simple steps-\nStep #1: Install mplayer and configure it. (mplayer because I am very sure that I won't be using it for playing music ever!)\nsudo apt install mplayer    \nnano ~/.mplayer/config  \n\ntype in that file-> lirc=no\nStep #2: Download this mp3 file from here (silence-10sec.mp3)\nStep #3: Create a folder in home directory and name it .hush\nCopy the mp3 file in your .hush directory  \ncp ~/Downloads/silence-10sec.mp3 ~/.hush/\n\nIn that folder, create a script file and name it silence.sh\nCopy paste this code in the script file.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nplugged=\"jack/headphone HEADPHONE plug\"\nunplugged=\"jack/headphone HEADPHONE unplug\"\n\nacpi_listen | while IFS= read -r event;\ndo\n    if [ \"$event\" == \"$plugged\" ]\n    then\n       mplayer -really-quiet -loop 0 ~/.scripts/silence-10sec.mp3 &\n    elif [ \"$event\" == \"$unplugged\" ]\n    then\n       pkill -f mplayer\n    fi\ndone\n\nMake it executable with the command chmod +755 silence.sh \nStep #4: Type startup applications in the Dash and add the path of silence.sh script to it.\n\nSo, basically what we are doing is listening to events of headphones been connected and disconnected and playing or stopping the blank mp3 file in a loop. Now, I have used mplayer because I know that I am never gonna use that for any other purpose and killing its process is completely safe for me.\n", "Q: Partitioning in Ubuntu? I just want to ask what \"/\" and \"/home\" means? What if I format my PC and re-install Ubuntu? Does it affect the / and /home directory? I want to protect my files in case Ubuntu crashes and I need to re-install or format. or I will make another partition where I can save my files so it cannot be deleted when I format my pc?\n\nA: In simple word /  is  the  root partition where Ubuntu stores it's system file where as /home is home partition where home directory of users is create.\nIf you want to protect your personal files during re-installation or in some  other circumstances , you can install / and /home in two different partition. \n\n\n*\n\n*Durring installtion in Installtion Type window select  Something\nElse\n\n*After this you can edit your partition if you needed.\n\n*Select the partition on which you wnat to use as /  and select\nMount point as /.\n\n*Once you're done deleting, resizing, and creating partitions, select the partition on which you want to use as /home  and select\nMount point  as /home.\n(Before going to next stem make sure both partition is of EXT4 type).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Forward to proceed the installation.\n\n\nA: You don't format your PC, you format the harddisk, or one or more partitions on that disk. Formatting means erasing everything. So you lose everything on that partition. \nWhen you install Linux, you can decide to put everything on one partition. In that case / and /home are on the same partition. Formatting that partition means erasing your home folder. When you create a special partition for /home, this won't happen. When reinstalling you need to specify to use that partition for /home. I haven't done this, but you probably have to create a new user (andie2), because I think Ubuntu won't let you use an existing user when installing. \nBest advice: make a backup of your home folder on an external harddisk. Use rsync or a backup tool, to make sure you copy all, including hidden files and folders. \n", "Q: How to change Gnome Media Pop-Up Option for Removable Hard Drive When plugging in a USB hard drive, my Gnome Ubuntu 14.04 desktop opens a pop-up at the bottom of the screen.

You may lost or damage your data, but if you want to try it, use some LiveCD with GParted (or install gparted when on liveCD system). \nAlso, you can use\ndf -h\n\ncommand in terminal to check available space in your system. Check \ndf -i\n\ntoo. If any of output will be around 100% in USE column, you can post it. \n", "Q: USB Boot Drive is not recognized from Windows computers I installed Ubuntu 14.04 to my 16GB PNY flash drive, to use as a boot disk for my laptop. Now, it is running ludicrously slow, no matter what, so I am trying to re-install Ubuntu, but when I plug my boot disk in to any other computers (usually running windows 7), it is not assigned a drive letter. The computer will install drivers for it, but when I try to access it, the drive is not there.\nEDIT1: The drive was formatted for NTFS during the initial install.\n\nA: From your comments above, it looks like you did a complete install of Ubuntu on the 16GB USB drive.\nThere are two methods to put Ubuntu in an USB. The first is a LiveUSB that is used to install Ubuntu in the hard drive. The second is a full install, where the USB works like a hard drive. See What would be the differences between a persistent USB Live Session and a installed Ubuntu in a USB drive? \nA full install on a 16GB USB, formatted the USB drive ext4. This is the format Ubuntu (Linux in general) requires. Ubuntu cannot be installed in NTFS. The ext4 partition where Ubuntu is installed cannot be changed to NTFS. If you do, you will lose all the ownership and permission information Ubuntu needs to work properly. Then Ubuntu won't work. \nOn the other hand, Windows does not know about ext4 format and thus can't read. \nSolutions:\nThere are third party extensions you can install in Windows to make it read ext4 partition. See 3 ways to access your Linux partition from Windows.\nAlternately, recreate the USB drive.\nYou can create a small (say 512MB) FAT32 partition in the beginning of the USB drive to share some data. This should be the first primary partition partition for Windows to see it. You can leave the rest of the 16GB unallocated for Ubuntu installation to find it. Or you can choose \"Something else...\" during Ubuntu installation and format the remaining part of the drive ext4 and select mount-point /.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 x64 display issue I am having Acer Aspire 5742Z Model-PEW71 laptop with NVIDIA GeForce GT 540M.I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 x64 with dual boot with Windows 7. After installation it was working good. I installed Java and eclipse. Updated display driver from setting updates. Next day when I started my laptop after selecting Ubuntu on startup screen it lands to ubuntu login screen, here I am getting issue, some times it allows to enter password, some times it shows blank screen, some time its getting hang on login screen, some time I am able to pass through login but on next it shows error message by saying send report problem, after pressing send report or cancel button the error message disappear, \nit shows full wallpaper with mouse courser but nothing else. \nHow can I solve this without re-installing ubuntu? I tried running with failsafe mode but still behaving same.\nSorry for typing mistakes and bad English.\n\nA: You should try installing the NVIDIA proprietary drivers.  If you can't download it via that computer, download it to a USB via another computer and then put it on your PC.  \nI've found that manual installs work best for installing nvidia drivers, so go to here and download the latest drivers.  By default, it'll most likely go into /Downloads, but if not, just know where it is.  Then, you'll want to press \n\nctrl + alt +F1-F6 (each is a different login)\n\nAnd then sign in to your account.  Then, you'll want to use\n\nsudo stop lightdm (or sudo service lightdm stop)\n\nThis shuts down the things that are using the GUI, so they can be updated.\nThen run\nchmod +x ~/* Folder that said driver is located in * / * Driver *\nFor example,\n\nchmod +x ~/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run\n\nMake SURE that you have the entire name of the driver, otherwise this will not work!  Caps do matter!\nWhat you just did was make the file executable.  Next, you'll want to run the following command, changed of course like the example above to fit your directories/driver versions.\n\nsudo sh ~/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run\n\nFor me, tabbing the rest of the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run file does not work for me, but it is CRUCIAL THAT YOU DO THIS.  If nothing happens after you run the second command, check your caps and spelling to make sure they are right.  You have to go through the program using the keyboard to correctly install it.  For me it will tell me that something went wrong right on the bat, just keep going and see if it still works.  If it asks you to install 32 bit libraries, do so.  Some programs (like steam games) will not run unless you have these installed.\nAfter all of the above has been done, one final command must be completed, or of course you could reboot.  \n\nsudo start lightdm (or sudo service lightdm start)\n\nThen, you'll do\n\nctrl + alt+ F7-F9ish (F7 is usually default, some people have different F keys though)\n\nThis should have worked for most people, if not keep looking, there's always a fix.  If anyone knows something about getting virtual 7.1 audio to work, please message me somehow.  Thanks.  Hope I helped someone.\nEdit:I've also heard x-swat repositories work better at times.  Not sure about that, but worth a try.\n(Pro tip, whenever Nvidia related stuff goes wrong, watch this.)\n", "Q: nis server doesn't export new users to client machines After a server migration on a new machine, the new users which are created on the server are able to login in it, but not on client machines (which get user list from the server). For the users created before the migration everything is ok.\nAny idea of what might be wrong?\n\nA: Solved; when migrating users and groups, UID and GID were kept, but new users in the new server had an UID lower than the lowest exported by yp (check the Makefile script in /var/yp and make suitable adjustments).\n", "Q: How can I keep the computer awake, depending on activity? I would like to be able to keep the computer awake during certain activities and longer running tasks, such as downloading larger files and watching full screen videos.\nI like using Caffeine to keep the computer from sleeping by preventing the display from sleeping. This worked well for me on my mac, but this does not work in Ubuntu.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: I am not sure why Caffeine does not keep your computer awake. I suspect it is because idle time on Ubuntu is equivalent to the time there is no user activity detected via keyboard or mouse. \nHow to prevent the computer from falling asleep\nIf you are looking for a solution to keep your computer awake like Caffeine does (should do), the solution below should work; I tested it on 14.04. It exists of two small scripts that you should store together in one and the same folder. You can switch it of or on (toggle) with a key combination. Once you press it, it will show the current state in a message:\n or: \nIt basically exists of a small background script that simulates a minor user action (keypress Ctrl) if idle time exceeds a defined amount of time, thus preventing the computer to go asleep or blank the screen. The keypress itself is meaningless and has no effect on playing video in full screen. \nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to have xprintidle and xdotool installed:\nsudo apt-get install xprintidle xdotool\n\n(inotify-tools should be installed by default on Ubuntu, might not be the case on Xu- or Lubuntu)\n\n*The script below is to toggle on/off, copy it into an empty file, save it as insomnia.py (keep the name as it is!) and make it executable(!)\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\nscript_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\ntry:\n    pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"-f\", \"caf.py\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    subprocess.Popen([\"kill\", pid])\n    subprocess.Popen([\"notify-send\", \"Computer doesn't stay awake...\"])\nexcept:\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", script_dir+\"/\"+\"caf.py\"])\n    subprocess.Popen([\"notify-send\", \"Computer stays awake...\"])\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The (main) script below is to keep the computer awake, copy the script into an empty file, save it as caf.py (keep the name as it is!) and make it executable(!)\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nseconds = 120 # number of seconds to start preventing blank screen / suspend\n\nwhile True:\n    curr_idle = subprocess.check_output([\"xprintidle\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    if int(curr_idle) > seconds*1000:\n        subprocess.call([\"xdotool\", \"key\", \"Control_L\"])\n    time.sleep(10)\n\nIt is important that you keep both scripts in the same folder!\n\n\n*\n\n*Now add a keyboard shortcut to toggle your Caffeine replacement on and off: \"System Settings\" > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\"\nAdd the command:\n/path/to/insomnia.py\n\nTo a key combination of your choice\nThat's it.\n\nA: You can also make use of the couple of script solutions here which in my opinion are more intelligent as they determine activity based on network activity or a folder size changing.\nFor example if you want to keep the computer awake while a backup or torrent client is working then use the second solution in the link by dhiya.  It will check network traffic and keep it awake until traffic stops.\nJust remember to change 'wlan0' to 'eth0' in the code if you are using ethernet and not wireless lan.\nUPDATE 17/09/2015: I modified dhiya's code from the link underneath to keep a system awake based on network traffic or user activity and to force graceful suspension if the desktop session ends up in the lock/login screen with no network traffic. The program logs everything to a log file. Config has also been provided to manage the logfile. I have named the program \"Keep Awake\".\nLINK:Is there any way to make Ubuntu not to suspend while a download in progress?\n\nA: Using Jacob Vlijm's really helpful script as a starting point, I've turned it into a full-fledged app with configuration options, battery awareness, etc.\nYou can grab it over at GitHub. No installation is necessary. Just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the .tar.gz and extract the files (or clone the master branch if you're a git user) to wherever you want the app to live. Having it on your $PATH is not necessary.\n\n*Install the dependencies:\nsudo apt install xdotool xprintidle\n\nIf you're using a laptop, you will also want acpi.\n\n*From the directory you installed, run sleep_inhibit.\n\n*If you want the app to automatically start every time you log in, open the icon's menu, select Preferences, and enable it in the preferences window.\n\n*If you decide to uninstall it, quit Sleep Inhibit, then run cleanup.py, being sure to answer yes to all questions. Then delete the directory, and all traces will be gone.\n\n\nA: xprintidle is not working here on Wayland and xdotool can be replaced with ydotool on Wayland.\nThere are more stories with org.gnome.ScreenSaver.SimulateUserActivity and gnome-session-inhibit but I have not settled with them.\nIf a script will set the value back, a solution can be:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 3600\n\nThe number represents the seconds. Use 0 for Never.\n", "Q: How to clean-up/remove files in /dev/sda7? My partition, /dev/sda7 is listed as 100% full.

First, I am running Ubuntu 14.04 currently on a mid 2011 MacbookPro on a dual-boot. Most of the questions I'm finding on here are regarding the initial wireless issues with installing Ubuntu 14.04, however I already have the wifi driver installed and it worked flawlessly for about 2 weeks and now I'm having some trouble. Main issue is that it will connect to wifi and work for a little while and then disconnect entirely from all wifi for awhile then connect again, and back and forth like this indefinitely.\nIn MacOS I'm having no trouble at all with continuous wifi connection. As for moving around a lot, this issue is primarily coming up when I'm on my school campus using their wifi system which registers devices using the MAC address and an online authentication. Because of this, I didn't have to re-register the computer because my MacOS was already registered under the same MAC address.\nThat being said. I have been sitting in the same spot for almost 6 hours and roughly every 5 minutes the wifi will disconnect or reconnect. I have also installed all available software updates available using the Software Updater in Ubuntu. MacOSX firmware is also fully up to date.\nI've run the wifi_script in hopes that someone can diagnose the problem (link: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/8351930/). Thanks in advance!\nUPDATE: I finally got a chance to test if it still worked on my home router (airport etreme basestation 2008-ish model) and it seems that the issue is localized to my school's campus for the 5 hours I was working with it at home I only had 1 instance of major slow down and no disconnects. I'll just have to take this into account when I have to use my Ubuntu partition. Thanks again for all your help!\n\nA: If this is an MBP 8,2 I can only offer this advice:\nIt won't ever be fully stable. I ran Ubuntu, and then Arch on my 8,2 up until it stopped working a few days ago and never figured out how to remedy this. Connections would always randomly 'drop'. (Disconnects but the icon indicates connected.)\nUsually, a simple disconnect and reconnect fixed it. In the rare occasion, I'd have to reboot the router. This gave me stability for a few days at a time, depending on how many machines were on the network. The more congested it was, the more likely my connection would drop again and the more frequent the droppings. If you ever run into an issue where OS X will connect but Ubuntu won't, or your phone will connect but your laptop won't (etc.) a reboot on the router will also clear that up.\nAlso, different routers seem to 'drop' less frequently. Never has issues with Apple's Airport branded stuff. The rest, (DLink, Cisco, Netgear) have all been hit or miss. \nSIDE NOTE: Heads up, if you're gonna try getting vgaswitcheroo working, be really careful. REALLY careful. You can't use a stock Ubuntu kernel. Don't even try.  Kernel 3.16-2 booted once with the two cards on, then shut down and lost all use of the internal display. Mac OS X, Arch, Windows, Ubuntu. None can see that there's 15 inches of screen sitting right there. It now only works with an external monitor via OS X. Even reinstalling OSX/using the firmware recovery methods/disc won't fix it. I'm not the only person it's happened to. You've been warned.\n", "Q: how can i clean up all the extra files on my computer running ubuntu 13.10? I have a 3 TB internal harddrive and i figured that it would last me a long time. well its filled up and i have no clue how. i do have a couple duplicated movies but only about 40GB in movies all together. and about 30GB in music and 70GB in pictures. so i can't for the life of me figure out why my harddrive is filling up. any ideas? ive already looked at my stats and all i can find is it saying how much is used and not used. when i look at what is using what it all looks right. ive tried a duplicate file finder but that only worked for music for some reason and there were like 70,000 files i would have to manually delete. i don't know what else to do.\n\nA: You could try the GNOME disk usage analyzer https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Baobab, it has helped me to easily identify the folders that contain more information and dig into the problem graphically.\nYou can analyze the full partition or just your home directory to find out where is the root cause of your problem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation confusion I need to know what are the things that are required to successfully install Ubuntu on my PC alongside Windows 8.1. \nI want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1 but every forum/site mentions something about UEFI/BIOS scenario or Disk Partitioning.\nThese are the things I did to install Ubuntu : \n\n\n*\n\n*I have created a live Ubuntu 14.04 USB drive.\n\n*I just freshly installed Windows 8.1 on my PC. I also have a backup\nof all my files in my external HDD.\n\n*I went to Run->msinfo32 and my BIOS mode is Legacy. My PC is a\nquite a bit old and came with Windows.\n\n*I set aside a separate partition (Local Disk E: - 30GB) just for\nUbuntu installation.\n\n*I also disabled Fast start-up from Power options.\n\n\nMy questions are : \n\n\n*\n\n*What is this UEFI/BIOS scenario and what should I do about it?\n\n*If I install Ubuntu in the E: drive I reserved, will it wipe other drives?\n\n*Is there something I should do in the BIOS settings of my computer?\n\n*What is partitioning of a drive? Will it create new drives like\nF/G/H... after installing Ubuntu on it?\n\n*What is GRUB and what should I do about it? \n\n\nI'm sorry if my questions were stupid but please explain to me in layman terms only. I'm very new to this stuff.\n\nA: In a nutshell,\n\n\n*\n\n*UEFI is a new technology that replaces BIOS on really new machines. Often these come built-in with Windows 8. I'm assuming you installed Windows 8 yourself and you mentioned legacy BIOS, therefore you need not worry about UEFI. You should be able to install Ubuntu without any hassle.\n\n*No, other drives will not be touched unless you tell the installer to do so. But, please keep in mind... Ubuntu (any linux distro for that matter) requires a special drive known as the SWAP, this will be different from what you choose to be your root drive. Think of it as extra memory of sorts. And whatever partition you reserved for ubuntu needs to be reformatted to ext3 or ext4 in order to install.\n\n*No, not unless you need to. In order to install ubuntu you may need to change the boot sequence but that will be all that needs to change.\n\n*Unless you have separate harddisks, what you are calling 'drives' like E: are actually partitions. these are nothing but chunks of your hard drive given a label. I suggest you read more on partitioning before you choose to manipulate them in any way. As to new drives, when you install Ubuntu on your current E drive by formatting it to ext4 for example, windows will no more recognize it as a drive. so, nothing new added but one will certainly vanish.\n\n*simply put, GRUB is a bootloader, meaning it lets you boot into operating systems. When you install Ubuntu, your current bootloader will be replaced with GRUB and everytime you start your machine you will see GRUB show you the choice between Windows and Ubuntu (unless configured otherwise) \n\n\nPlease read the official docs before asking simple questions like those. they are easily answered by a simple web search.\n", "Q: How would I use tar for full backup and restore with system on SSD and home on HDD? How would I use tar for full backup and restore with system on SSD and home on HDD?\nThe existing backup and restore answers don't seem to cover the case where root and home are on separate devices\n\nA: It is adviced to make TWO backups. 1 for / and 1 for /home if they are on different partition. If you want one you will have to add a lot of exceptions to that one command. Example:\nsudo su\ncd /\ntar -cvpzf backup.tar.gz --exclude=/backup.tar.gz --one-file-system / \ntar -cvpzf backuphome.tar.gz --one-file-system /home/\n\nwill backup your root and exclude ALL mounted partitions, like /media (you do not want to backup external devices (you really do not)) and you absolutely do NOT want to backup something like /dev or /proc. And /home goes to another backup.\nIn above method the backup are stored in /. It will be bettter to store it on an external media; you can then put a directory in front of the backup.tar.gz and drop the --exclude=... from the 1st command.\n\n\n*\n\n*backup.tar.gz is the backup. \n\n*The --exclude will prevent the actual backup to be backupped.\n\n*cvpzf: create, verbose, preserve permissions, compress, use a file.\n\n*--one-file-system - Do not include files on a different filesystem. If you want other filesystems, such as a /home partition, or external media mounted in /media backed up, you either need to back them up separately, or omit this flag. If you do omit this flag, you will need to add several more --exclude= arguments to avoid filesystems you do not want. These would be /proc, /sys, /mnt, /media, /run and /dev directories in root. /proc and /sys are virtual filesystems that provide windows into variables of the running kernel, so you do not want to try and backup or restore them. /dev is a tmpfs whose contents are created and deleted dynamically by udev, so you also do not want to backup or restore it. Likewise, /run is a tmpfs that holds variables about the running system that do not need backed up (Source).\n\nSo  ...  if you really still want a \"one-liner\" it could look like this:\ncd /\ntar -cvpzf backup.tar.gz --exclude=/backup.tar.gz --exclude=/proc \n--exclude=/tmp --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/dev --exclude=/sys / \n\n(I hope I got all of what needs to be excluded)\n\nRestoring would be \nsudo su\ncd /\ntar xvzf backup.tar.gz\n\n\nI did not use sudo in front of the tar command since you will get error messages regarding  permissions (because of files owned by root).\n", "Q: Can software written for windows be used on linux? we have programs at work that I would like to use on my linux laptop, is there a shell program i can run to be able to use them or must i have a dual boot system, limited HD space.\nRegards\nGavin\n\nA: its called wine you get it by sudo apt-get install wine you will need to have the 32 bit library's then you do sudo wine windowsexe.exe  \n", "Q: Upgraded to 14.04 but have a problem editing grub I am trying to edit this file to add \"nomodeset\" to the end of the line.\nIs there any way to edit a buffer?

I have two hdd's, and I want to run xubuntu on one of them and windows 7 on the other. I do not not have a USB thumbdrive unfortunately. Can I use wubi, if not what can I then use? \n\nA: Xubuntu 14.04 cannot be installed with wubi installer any longer. Kubuntu 14.04 can be installed with wubi though, and it might be a better choice than Xubuntu, at least as far as I am concerned, and you can choose Kubuntu instead of Xubuntu, it looks nice and it runs pretty well once you stop akonadi server and disable nepomuk search plugin. But there is a trick, you have to follow this tutorial to be able to install Kubuntu 14.04 inside Windows (with wubi installer).\nA far better choice would be to try the 'new' Xubuntu 12.04.5 which is an excellent distro with a very stable kernel, and this one can be installed with Wubi installer without any headaches. To do so:\nDownload your iso image from this link, choose either precise-desktop-i386.iso for a 32bit install if you have a 32bit Windows system, or precise-desktop-amd64.iso for a 64bit install if you have a 64bit Windows system.\nAfter you download the iso image, you can download the wubi installer from this link, it is located right at the end of the list. Next you should create a temporary folder on your desktop that you can label ubuntu and place inside this new folder both the iso image that you just downloaded and the wubi installer.\nAnd finally, you can start installing Xubuntu inside Windows by running the wubi installer from your temporary folder. You cannot use your entire hard disk (the second one) to install Xubuntu on it because you can allocate up to 30GB of space and no more when using wubi installer. So you can partition your second hard disk into one or more NTFS drives, and then choose only one of them to install Xubuntu in there. \nRemember, you can use max. 30GB for Xubuntu (which is more than enough), and leave the rest of space for storing your windows data (movies, music, docs and pictures). You can even move or copy video and/or audio files that you download while using Xubuntu anywhere on your 2 hard disks and run them either from Windows or from Xubuntu.\nChoose your username, a password, don't forget to also choose from the Wubi dropdown menu Xubuntu instead of Ubuntu or Kubuntu or something else. Press install and wait for the installer to copy files and create the virtual disks. At the end you'll be asked to restart your computer to finish Xubuntu installation. Reboot and wait until Xubuntu 12.04.5 is installed on your computer.\n\nA: No, you can't use Wubi. It hasn't supported Xubuntu for a number of releases now. You shouldn't use Wubi to install even Ubuntu anymore. It's not supported properly and there isn't a Wubi.exe for 14.04.1 either.\nActually you could use Wubi, if you are some hobbyist hacker type. I've installed Xubuntu with Wubi and converted it to a \"real\" install. But the effort required and chance of failure isn't worth it to explain all the steps here, sorry.\nSo my advice is... buy a USB thumb drive. You should have one anyway as a backup/repair disk. Install Xubuntu as a normal dual boot and you'll be a lot happier in the long run.\n", "Q: Can't enable bluetooth on Ubuntu 14.04 I can not enable bluetooth using the bluetooth preference window.

It's perfectly normal that this doesn't work on your system, because the manufacturer of the sound chip is NVidia. You computer thus disables the device:\ngenirq: Flags mismatch irq 5. 00000080 (snd_hda_intel) vs. 00000000 (parport0)\nhda-intel: unable to grab IRQ 5, disabling device\n\nYour list of playback devices also shows NVidia hardware.\nYou need to find and use a driver for your NVidia platform.\n", "Q: How can I reload dhclient without restarting network? I am using ubuntu 14.04 on ec2 instance, I am changing dhcp settings as part of the provisioning process, and I cant find a way to reload the dhclient. Infact, theres no way to restart network on 14.04 cloud instances. Any suggestions? \n\nA: The -r flag explicitly releases the current lease, and once the lease has been released, the client exits. Open a terminal and type the command:\n$ sudo dhclient -r\n\nNow obtain fresh IP:\n$ sudo dhclient \n\n\nA: Typically I do this by running dhclient as a single command like so:\n$ sudo -Es\n$ dhclient -r; dhclient\n\nYou can use this trick if you've made changes to /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf:\n$ cat /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf\ntimeout 300;\nretry 60;\nsupersede domain-search \"dom1.mydom.com\", \"dom2.mydom.com\";\nprepend domain-name-servers 192.168.7.185,192.168.7.186;\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Force DHCP Client (dhclient) to Renew IP Address\n\nA: Yeah... no. dhclient -x or dhclient -r didn't work for me.\nWhat did work was\nsudo su\nps fax\n\nthen copy the entire command-line that starts with /sbin/dhclient, including all the command-line options, file paths, etc...\nThen\npkill dhclient\n\nand paste the command-line from ps fax into your terminal and hit enter.\n", "Q: Remove Ubuntu from a MacBook and put OS X back on I bought a MacBook off eBay, thinking it would have OS X on it, but it didn't. It came with Ubuntu instead. I think it is a 2006 model or a 2007 model. I want to know how to put OS X back on it as I don't like Ubuntu. \n\nA: This has nothing to do with Ubuntu or Linux. To remove an operating system, you just format the whole drive and install the new operating system over it.\nIf you are lucky, it's a dual boot computer. Hold the X Button while booting to boot into OSX if it is available. From there you can remove Ubuntu (to get help on this see https://apple.stackexchange.com/). If you still can not boot OSX, read further.\nSince you bought a device, but apparently no license of OSX (you really got no disc?), you'll have to buy it somehow or use the help of a friend, as amanthethy wrote in his answer. This is an unusual case. Normally, the OS is preinstalled and it makes no sense to remove it, since if you buy a new device, the OS comes with it.\nIf you have no disc or USB drive of osx\nAsk a friend with OSX to create you a copy (like amanthethy wrote) or buy it:\nHere you can buy Snow Leopard, which is the oldest I found in the store. You can freely upgrade the OS if the device supports it. Make sure that your device is supported by this version of OSX first.\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MC573Z/A/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard\nHow to install\nTo install the OS, just insert the disc, choose the disc tool in settings and format the whole drive. Then choose to install it. It's pretty straight forward.\nFor better help on OSX\nPlease note: The correct place to ask detailed osx questions is here:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/\n\nA: Reinstall OS X Snow Leopard from the OS X Snow Leopard install disc. If you don't have one, you'll have to find someone who does and get them to lend it to you. I think Apple stopped making them (the discs) about 4 years ago.\nIf you can't get a copy of the Snow Leopard install disc, you can try installing a newer version of OS X USB. Google how to make a bootable OS X USB. You'll need a working Mac for this as you need to download the OS X install files from the Apple App Store and make the USB install stick with tools that run on OS X. Your MacBook may be too old to run the newer versions thought. You'll have to do some research on your own, bud (ie. Google \"Can my MACMODEL# run OS X \nVERSIONYOUWANTTORUN\"). \nThis question isn't Ubuntu related. You won't find much more help than this here.\n\nA: Unlike more modern Macs, the 2006/2007 models came with an installation CD/DVD so your best bet is to find a friend with a copy of OSX 10.4 Tiger, OSX 10.5, Leopard or OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard which is the latest system these models will run. You may find them on eBay or at a Mac store such as OWC Macsales. Once you have an installation disc, insert it into the MacBook's optical drive, reboot holding down the C key. When that's opened, select Disk Utility from the tools, and reformat and partition the drive, then the installation should be straightforward.\n", "Q: How can I change the destination folder of Grive? I recently found Grive on the software center, and it seems like a very well made Google Drive client for Ubuntu, and Google will never make Drive for Linux, so I gave Grive a try. Works really well, but all I have is one question for all of you pros out there:  Is there any way to change the destination folder's location? The grive setup app looks like it links all the files and libs and shiz, so I'm sure you can change the script to work with a custom destination on your drive, but I myself am a bit too busy to do that. Anyone?\n\nA: It seems you have to do it via the terminal.  On a fresh install of Grive, instead of running the Grive setup app run\ngrive -p path_to_your_preferred_folder -a\n\nThis command changes the Google Drive folder and starts the synchronization of files.\n\nA: just copy the grive folder to your desired location which most probably will be another drive on your system. Now to sync your files with google drive right click on the drive that have the grive folder and click open this in terminal. After that you will see the terminal here just type grive to start the syncronization process.\n", "Q: How do i get permission to edit freedesktop.org.xml? I'm relatively new to using Ubuntu and I just recently upgraded to 14.04 LTS and as of the upgrade I can no longer run locally saved .swf files in my browser.\nI did some googling for the answer and came up with editing the line \n<mime-type type=\"application/vnd.adobe.flash.movie\">\n\nin mime's freedesktop.org.xml file to\n<mime-type type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">\n\nbut attempting to do so tells me I do not have permission.\nI'm aware that I need to edit the file as root, but I simply do not now how to do so.\nThank you in advance for taking the time to read this and hopefully answer my probably really dumb, and simple question.\n\nA: What you might want to do is open up terminal with ctrl+alt+t and get to the folder where the file exists, for example: \ncd /usr/tmp\n\nOnce you are in the folder, do\nsudo chmod 777 insertfilenamehere\n\nThat gives you full permission to edit that file.\nNext you can edit it, and save it without problems!\nProfit!\n", "Q: Is there a light-weight minimal Unity Desktop for Ubuntu 14.04? New to linux here. I created a VM in virtualbox for the latest Ubuntu to get comfortable with linux and to learn Python. I was wondering if there is a lighter-weight desktop for Ubuntu, that still comes with all the useful keyboard shortcuts that unity uses, and still has something similar to the unity launcher for pinning and quick launching commonly used applications. If not, is there a way to turn off the graphical effects? I don't remember having such performance issues before with previous versions of ubuntu.\nThe Laptop I'm running this VM on is a Thinkpad T440p, i5 processor and 8gigs of memory. Should be more than enough to run this well right?\n\nA: I don't know if this is your very first incursion into the Ask Ubuntu Support System. If so, welcome to Ask Ubuntu.\nFor your \"minimal\" experience, I guess that you have a very robust computer which should not experience any issues by running the latest Ubuntu. Maybe you're missing something related to your Graphic Card drivers? Which can be solved by following one of the answers to previous questions like this: Installing Video Drivers \nIf you insist on \"minimal\" desktop environments it will be great if you dive in the answers to this question: What kinds of desktop environments and shells are available? \nBut, your question seems to be related to a customized learning need, for which I would suggest the usage of the i3 Window Manager which made my life easier even for low resources computer.\nAt this very moment I am on an HP Mini with 2GB RAM and 1.6 Intel Atom Microprocessor, 250 GB HDD and Ubuntu 14.04 figuratively does fly!!!\nAnyway, if you go for learning, this is a really really really comprehensive solution for focusing on learning, coding and development. And, oh! yeah, I mentioned before... Solving speed issues even for low resources computers.\nFor what is about software, almost any software will run faster than what it would under other Window Managers or Desktop Environments. Your will miss the Window decorations and these fancy and eye candy stuff but it will be just the first 24 hours. When you notice that your computer is 4-8 times faster, you will wish no window decorations. \nBTW. A good companion for i3WM is Synapse, so, make sure to follow a good plan to enter this twilight zone. I would suggest you the next steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you read enough before using i3, you may feel lost when\nyou see nothing but an empty screen with no right click contextual\nmenu and other stuff.\n\n*Install i3 Window Manager by dropping the next in a terminal: sudo\napt-get install i3, provide your user password and allow the\ncomputer to finish installing the software.\n\n*Make sure you install Synapse, it will be really helpful for you if\nyou feel lost, drop the next in a terminal: sudo apt-get install\nsynapse and allow the computer to finish installing.\n\n*Log Out and Make sure you choose the proper i3 Window Manager from\nthe list of Desktop Environments/Window Managers when logging-in\nagain. It can be chosen by hitting the small circle close to your\nname before entering your password in the log in section.\n\n*After logging in, you will be presented with the options to start\nusing i3WM and you will need to choose a \"mod\" key, I suggest you to\nkeep the \"WinKey\" as your mod key because of the \"Alt\" may crash\nagainst some program's key bindings.\n\n*After choosing your mod key, press the WinKey+D key combination in\norder to invoke i3 top panel launcher and write \"synapse\" without\nquotation marks.\n\n\nWhen Synapse appears on screen you can invoke whatever you wish and start working. It would be great if you start by opening your favorite web browser and go to the i3 User Guide in order to learn what to do with the windows. Basically I give you the next tips.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mod (WinKey) + Number (1,2,3,4, [...] 0 = Switch to another desktop.\n\n*Mod (WinKey) + Arrow = Move to another application (Up, Down, Left,\nRight)\n\n*Mod (WinKey) + Shift + Arrow = Move application to the contiguous\ndesktop.\n\n*Mod (WinKey) + Shift + Number (1,2 [...] 0) = Move application to the\nchosen desktop number).\n\n*Mod (WinKey) + w = Activate the tabs (applications appears as tabs)\n\n*Mod (Winkey) + e = Activate tiling (applications appears as tiling)\n\n*Mod (Winkey) + Shift + space = Toggle window floating (will float as in a\nnormal DE)\n\n*Mod (WinKey) + Shift + Q = Quit program (any program will close with\nthis key combo)\n\n\nYou can use mouse on windows to resize, select, focus, etc. And it will take a while for you to get used to your new windows tiling system but it is worth if what you expect is speed from your computer.\nA screenshot from my current desktop is placed here for you to see i3WM in action.\n\nOn this screenshot you can see Nautilus File Browser floating and the other windows are tiling. \nI hope this help you. Remember that there are lots of Desktop Environments, some of them are fancy but the fanciest = more resources needed. So have it in consideration and...\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Dual monitor setup, why does NVidia 340 Prime only detect one monitor? I'm using:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alienware M14xR2 laptop running Ubuntu 14.04\n\n*2 * DELL U2412M monitors attached via HDMI and Mini Display Port\n\n*Optimus graphics (Intel + nVidia GeForce GT 650M) running with nvidea-340 and nvidia-prime, with Prime setup in nvidia-settings GUI to use the NVidia GPU\n\n*built-in laptop monitor disabled\n\n\nUnfortunately, the monitors only work successfully in the default mirrored setup - I have the following issues trying to get a dual external screen extended desktop to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*nvidia-settings GUI can only see one monitor on the X Server Display Config page. System Display GUI can see both displays but can only mirror the displays successfully. By fiddling with Display GUI and ARandR, I temporarily managed to get an extended desktop working, but NVidia GUI still only sees one of the monitors and if I try to reboot with 2 monitors attached, the GUI is totally glitched and unusable after login.\n\n*During boot, the system just uses the left monitor (via HDMI i/f) for display, so I presume this is treated as the primary display. However, after boot, it appears the system switches to using the Display Port for the primary display and the system will not let me have the Ubuntu launcher only on the left (HDMI) display. The only options that work are for having the launcher on both or just on the right (Display Port) monitor. I tried to forcefully fix the issue with the primary monitor incorrectly being set to the right monitor by changing the primary monitor switch in ~/.config/monitors.xml, however this does not work and causes both monitors to appear at strange resolutions and glitch badly with uncoordinated mouse input.\n\n\nRunning  /usr/lib/nvidia-340/bin/nvidia-xconfig --query-gpu-info gives\nNumber of GPUs: 1\n\nGPU #0:\n  Name      : GeForce GT 650M\n  UUID      : GPU-...\n  PCI BusID : PCI:1:0:0\n\n  Number of Display Devices: 1\n\n  Display Device 0 (DFP-0):\n      EDID Name             : DELL U2412M\n      Minimum HorizSync     : 30.000 kHz\n      Maximum HorizSync     : 83.000 kHz\n      Minimum VertRefresh   : 50 Hz\n      Maximum VertRefresh   : 61 Hz\n      Maximum PixelClock    : 170.000 MHz\n      Maximum Width         : 1920 pixels\n      Maximum Height        : 1200 pixels\n      Preferred Width       : 1920 pixels\n      Preferred Height      : 1200 pixels\n      Preferred VertRefresh : 60 Hz\n      Physical Width        : 520 mm\n      Physical Height       : 320 mm\n\nRunning xrandr --query gives\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3120 x 1920, maximum 16384 x 16384\nDP-0 connected primary 1200x1920+1920+0 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200      60.0*+\n   ...\nDP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nLVDS1 connected\n   1600x900       60.0 +   40.0  \n   ...\nDP1 disconnected\nDP2 disconnected\nHDMI1 connected 1920x1200+0+0 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200      60.0*+\n   ...\nHDMI2 disconnected\nVGA1 disconnected\nVIRTUAL1 disconnected\n\nRunning lspci | grep VGA gives\n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n  01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK107M [GeForce GT 650M] (rev a1)\n\nMy xorg.conf is almost empty but I believe 14.04 automatically detects those settings.\n\nA: Post-installation and removal Nvidia, I noticed a strange(and a good one at that) behavior.

So I decided to uninstall and live with the existing setup.\nHowever, with the fresh installation, I am able to work with a dual monitor setup that is not perfect, but usable. I mirrored the displays and ensured that the intel's graphics driver could do the rendering(but it is lousy though I admit)\n\nA: It seems that due to the unconventional way Dell wired up the 3 display ports, the Nvidia GFX and the on-board Intel GFX in the Alienware M14xR2, you cannot use HDMI and MDP for the external monitors. It is also not possible to disable the Intel GFX in bios as Dell wired up the Nvidia card to pass through the Intel card!\nUsing the HDMI and VGA ports for the monitors solves this issue and allows the use of an external dual monitor setup on Ubuntu 14.10 without mirroring.\nHowever, at the time of writing, the Nvidia 340 and 346 series of drivers are not working for this dual monitor setup and will only work properly using just one monitor. Only Nvidia 331 series seems to support this dual setup (or Nouveau - but that driver shows a very noisy picture on the second monitor and its 3D acceleration does not work properly either).

I use the same methods described here.\nsudo bash -c echo \"profile\" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method\nbash: /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method: Permission denied\n\nI also tried to switch to root sudo -i and do the same but not working. Any ideas?\n\nA: The redirection operator is not part of your sudo command. In other words, when you execute sudo bash -c echo \"profile\" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method, what actually happens is:\n\n\n*\n\n*The shell executes sudo bash -c echo \"profile\"\n\n*sudo, which has the setuid bit set, asks for your password, and forks the process bash -c echo \"profile\" with EUID set to 0 (i.e., the command is executed as root)\n\n*The bash command executes echo \"profile\" and prints profile to standard output as root.\n\n*bash terminates, sudo terminates\n\n*The shell running your original command takes the string from standard output and tries to redirect it to /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method, which gets you a Permission denied since the shell is not running with root privileges.\n\n\nThere are a number of ways to solve this. One is to give the entire string with the redirection operator as argument to bash -c:\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"profile\" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method'\n\nI've also often seen people use tee, which looks somewhat nicer (and doesn't execute the echo command as root):\necho \"profile\" | sudo tee /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method\n\ntee reads from standard input and outputs that to both standard output and all files you passed it as parameters.\n", "Q: Partition names in /media change frequently, how to force stable name?

My goal was to keep the Dell untouched and have Ubuntu on a removable flash drive that I could plug into the computer, hit the appropriate key on my computer at power on to get a list of boot options and then choose Ubuntu when I wanted to run Ubuntu. Otherwise, with the flash drive removed, the computer would run Windows 8.1 as before\nTo install Ubuntu, I created an EFI system partition on the flash drive (sdf1) and explicitly specified during installation that the Grub files be installed there (sdf1) and not on my Windows drive (sda).  \nEverything works fine if I have the flash drive with Ubuntu plugged in and turn on the computer. Grub comes up with a menu of boot options including Windows and both Ubuntu and Windows run fine. The problem is that if I remove the flash drive from the computer, then instead of booting Windows I get a Grub rescue command prompt.\n\n\n*\n\n*What do I need to do to get the Dell computer back to it's original state where it boots Windows as it did before using the Windows bootloader? I've researched the problem and tried most of the things on the Windows end (running Windows repair (get a message that Windows can't repair, see log), booting to a command prompt and running bootrec fixboot scanos (which returned no O/S found) and such).\n\n*Once I've fixed the computer, can I copy the boot files in sda2 to sdf1 in order to be able to get my flash drive to boot when plugged into the computer? This is not a big deal as I can live without the Ubuntu; my primary concern is getting the computer back to booting Windows.\nIt seems like things are working as they should (other than the fact that the Ubuntu boot files got installed on sda2 instead of sdf1 as I specified) so there should be no \"bugs\" or guesswork in any of this--just a question of understanding what the Ubuntu install did. \n\nA: It turned out to be a simple fix (to restore the ability of the system to boot Windows when the Ubuntu flash drive is not plugged in). \nI went to BIOS and chose to reload the default settings. That made the Windows boot manager show up once again and everything is back to working the way it was. \n", "Q: Unable to Dual Boot Windows 8 ( 64bit ) and ubuntu 12.04 I bought new Asus Laptop with DOS and installed windows 8.1 64bit and then i installed Ubuntu 12.04 but as with other os my boot options does not show windows 8 and ubuntu\nThen i tried EasyBCD now windows 8 and ubuntu is show but when i click on ubuntu it agains boots and ubuntu now starts agains boot option came\n\nA: Ok here's one\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all your data to some external drive\n\n*Assuming you already have Windows installed on your system.\n\n*Install Ubuntu from your medium preferably flash-drive \n\n*Restart your PC to complete the installation\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu and run a grub update\nsudo update-grub \nfrom the terminal and it should detect and add the windows bootloader to the grub.

My fans used to run high, constantly.

Shut it down completely, so don't \"restart\" it.\nOnce you turn your computer back on and select the linux operating system whose grub file you edited earlier, your fans should be working normally.

The command is : which acts like a no-operation.  The argument to that command is \"${!1:? \"Variable not defined.\"}\".  In bash, the construct ${!1} returns the value of the variable whose name is given by $1, the first argument to the function. If the variable whose name is $1 is set and not null, then \"${!1:? \"Variable  not defined.\"}\" returns its value.  Its value is ignored by : because : is a no-op.  If the variable with that name is either unset or null, then, because of the :? parameter expansion construct, the given error message is returned. \nImproved Output Format\nThe above function did not return exactly the message that you asked for.  We can fix that:\n$ def() { ( : \"${!1:? \"Variable  not defined.\"}\" ) 2>&1 | sed 's/^bash: !1:  //'; }\n$ def NONESUCH\nVariable not defined.\n\nOr,\n$ def() { ( : \"${!1:?}\" ) 2>/dev/null || echo \"Variable not defined\"; }\n$ def NONESUCH\nVariable not defined\n\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (and perhaps a bit before that, but not as far back as 10.04 LTS), the bash version in Ubuntu has been at least 4.2. Thus it supports the -v operator for the test, [, and [[ builtins.\nIf you only learn one way to test if variables are defined in bash, it should probably be the parameter expansion technique used in John1024's excellent answer. Even though Ubuntu systems using bash 4.1 and earlier are becoming increasingly uncommon, 10.04 still has limited server support, and earlier versions of bash are much more common on some other GNU/Linux systems (and other Unix-like OSes).\nBut if you have bash 4.2 or higher, the \"improved output format\" from John1024's answer can be further simplified to:\ndef() { [ -v \"$1\" ] || echo 'Variable not defined'; }\n\nNote that if foo is the name of the variable you're interested in, [ -v foo ]--not [ -v $foo ]--tests if it's defined. In this case, I have $1 because the first positional parameter passed to def will contain the name of the variable to be tested as its value. (The $ in my example achieves the same additional level of indirection achieved by ! in the ${...} expression of John1024's example.)\nek@Ilex:~$ def() { [ -v \"$1\" ] || echo 'Variable not defined'; }\nek@Ilex:~$ def PATH\nek@Ilex:~$ def NONESUCH\nVariable not defined\n\n\nBoth my and John1024's def implementations will print Variable not defined:\n\n\n*\n\n*when no variable by the name passed as the function's first argument exists\n\n*but also when no first argument is passed to def.\n\n\nThat is:\nek@Ilex:~$ def\nVariable not defined\n\nIf you'd prefer a separate message in that situation, you can handle the case of def receiving no arguments separately:\ndef() {\n    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo 'error: too few arguments' >&2\n        return 1\n    elif [ ! -v \"$1\" ]; then\n        echo 'Variable not defined'\n    fi\n}\n\nI've written that based on the idea that having def's first argument exist, whether or not it names a defined variable, is considered normal operation, and not an error. In contrast, passing no arguments to def is an error and I've treated it as such:\n\n\n*\n\n*>&2 sends the output of echo to standard error.\n\n*return 1 makes def return with nonzero exit status, indicating failure. (This is mainly useful for when a call to def will appear instead a compound statement or script, though the exit status of the last command may also be checked with echo $?.)\nIn other cases def will return the default exit status of 0 (unless of course there's some other error, such as echo being unable to write Variable not defined to standard output).\nek@Ilex:~/source$ def NONESUCH\nVariable not defined\nek@Ilex:~/source$ def\nerror: too few arguments\n\n\nA: According to Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide:    \n\nIn a script, aliases have very limited usefulness. It would be nice if\n  aliases could assume some of the functionality of the C preprocessor,\n  such as macro expansion, but unfortunately Bash does not expand\n  arguments within the alias body. [117] Moreover, a script fails to\n  expand an alias itself within \"compound constructs,\" such as if/then\n  statements, loops, and functions. An added limitation is that an alias\n  will not expand recursively. Almost invariably, whatever we would like\n  an alias to do could be accomplished much more effectively with a\n  function.\n\nThis is why you should follow Eliah Kagan or John1024 answer.\n", "Q: Download from YouTube failed I installed youtube-dl and executing the  command it shows:\n[youtube] Setting language\n[youtube] _gp51lt9kdA: Downloading video webpage\n[youtube] _gp51lt9kdA: Downloading video info webpage\n[youtube] _gp51lt9kdA: Extracting video information\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/youtube-dl\", line 4645, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/usr/bin/youtube-dl\", line 4636, in main\n    _real_main()\n  File \"/usr/bin/youtube-dl\", line 4620, in _real_main\n    retcode = fd.download(all_urls)\n  File \"/usr/bin/youtube-dl\", line 869, in download\n    ie.extract(url)\n  File \"/usr/bin/youtube-dl\", line 1135, in extract\n    return self._real_extract(url)\n  File \"/usr/bin/youtube-dl\", line 1406, in _real_extract\n    url_map = dict((ud['itag'][0], ud['url'][0] + '&signature=' + ud['sig'][0]) for ud in url_data)\n  File \"/usr/bin/youtube-dl\", line 1406, in <genexpr>\n    url_map = dict((ud['itag'][0], ud['url'][0] + '&signature=' + ud['sig'][0]) for ud in url_data)\nKeyError: 'sig'\n\n\nA: Update youtube-dl by adding this PPA \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install youtube-dl\n\nThen you may download any video as usual.

With ext2, that happened often after a power outage, but with ext3 and ext4, one of which you are likely to be using if your system is newer than ten years, this generally does not happen unless there is faulty hardware involved.\nThe first command, mount -o rw,remount / essentially tells the system \"It is fine, there are no errors on this disk, and you can assume the file system to be consistent enough to write files.\" This is a bold statement, especially right after you received an error message stating that a file system check found problems that are so bad that the automated repairs would probably have to delete files in order to get the file system back into working shape.\nThe second command, dpkg --configure -a then attempted to run the post-installation scripts for packages that are marked in the dpkg database as having their files unpacked, but the scripts not run yet. If this command attempted to do anything, this means that you will need to do that later on, but now is not the proper time. The dpkg tool exists all file systems to be mounted and error-free, you only have a root file system with errors, and all others are missing.\nThe way to resolve your situation is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go back to read-only mode using mount -o ro,remount /. You do not want the kernel to change anything in the file system while the repair is under way.\n\n*Repair the root file system, using the fsck utility, which will then use the fsck.ext3 utility internally: fsck -f /.\nYou can add the option -C0 to get a progress indicator.\nIf you get messages about fsck being unable to read blocks because of I/O errors, you can interrupt with Ctrl-C and add the -c option to scan for bad blocks beforehand. This will take ages, but the repair operation then does not attempt to rescue any files spread over defective sectors.\nMost likely you will be asked if you agree to certain problems being fixed. Look up the error messages using your search engine of choice, there is ample documentation on the Internet. Most of these are about deleting files that are beyond repair, or moving them to the lost+found directory.\n\n*After that is complete, you will most likely be asked to reboot, in capital letters. This is a good idea, just enter sync first, give the disks a few seconds to write out the remaining data and then press Ctrl-Alt-Del. The reboot will be immediate, without unmounting file systems, but that is fine because the only file system mounted is read-only.\n\n*If after the reboot you are dropped back into the same prompt, another file system but the root file system is in need of repairs as well. Use the fsck -A command to attempt an automated repair of all non-root file systems, and manually repair those that need it.

I want to add some folder to the launcher so that I can access them at ease. How do I add shortcut to launcher? \n\nA: There are two ways:\nDynamically\nYou can add a shortcut to a folder by browsing (in nautilus) into the folder you want to add, and choose \"add bookmark\" from the bookmark menu. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+D. Bookmarks you created this way are added automatically to the Files icon in the launcher, in the top section (Nautilus adds these shortcuts to the file: ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks).\nIn the \"static\" section of the launcher's icon.\nAlternatively, you can add a shortcut to the Files icon (or any other icon), by editing its .desktop file. This method gives you more control over the name of the shortcut, and the order of shortcuts, if you have more than one.\n\n\n*\n\n*To do that, first copy the .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications\ncp /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop  ~/.local/share/applications/nautilus.desktop\n\n\n*Open the (copied) file with gedit; it won't open by double-click, so open a gedit window and drag the file over the gedit window.\n\n*Look for the line:\nActions=Window;\n\nAdd a name that you would like to give your folder in the launcher:\nActions=Window;YourFolder;\n\n\n*At the end of the file, add a section like this:\n[Desktop Action YourFolder]\nName=YourFolder\nExec=nautilus /path/to/thefolder\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nLog out and back in, now you'll have your shortcut in the Files icon by right-click.\nExplanation:\nIcons in Dash and the launcher represent .desktop files. These icons have one \"main\" command (that's what happens if you click on it), but also can have a number of shortcuts (accessible by right-click). \nThis \"main\" command can be found in the Exec= line, in the section directly below [Desktop Entry], the shortcuts are listed in the line Actions=, and defined in the [Desktop Action YourFolder] - section(s).\n.desktop files in ~/.local/share/applications overrule the ones in /usr/share/applications, but the first time after you copy the original to the local directory, you have to log out/in. The clean procedure is always to edit the local one and leave the original untouched.\nNote:\nBookmarks that you created by the first method, are added to the icon automatically, but are not part of the nautilus.desktop file.\n\nEdit for 15.04 and later\nThe answer above applies for 15.04 and above as well, but the launcher to edit (locally copied) for the static section is:\n/usr/share/applications/org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop\n\ninstead of \n/usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop\n\n", "Q: how do i prevent ubuntu from starting GUI automaticaly? i am looking for a way to start my GUI manually when ubuntu loads something like back-track which you login in first using command-line then type startx then GUI starts to running\n\nA: You can disable It by using \nsudo update-rc.d -f lightdm remove\nThe above commmand will remove the lightdm symlinks in the various runlevel init directories e.g. /etc/rc0.d, rcS.d, rc2.d etc..\nNow after every login you need to enter startx command mannually to start GUI.\nTo enble it type \nsudo update-rc.d -f lightdm defaults\n", "Q: Touchscreen on Ubuntu 14.04 I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my thinkpad yoga, and touch worked out of the box (Thank you devs). But I can't figure out how to configure more gestures. \nDoes anyone know what software is being used by default?\nI've seen on some posts there's some hardcoded gestures in Unity.

But it requires building unity.\n", "Q: How to send a file as an input to another file? Through the command shell we can redirect the three standard filestreams so that we can get input from either a file or another command instead of from our keyboard, and we can write output and errors to files or send them as input for subsequent commands.\nSo why can't we give input to an other file as\n~# /root/Documents/text1.txt > /root/Documents/text2.txt\n\n\nA: You can redirect the content of text1.txt using the cat command:\n~# cat /root/Documents/text1.txt > /root/Documents/text2.txt\n\nNote: you can use cat to also create new binary files, e.g:\n~# cat mypic.jpg > my_new_pic.jpg\n\n\nA: You can't use file1 > file2 to copy file1's contents to file2 because there's no command there. You have to issue some command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Redirections apply to (1) a command you run or (2) the shell as a whole (if applied to the exec builtin). But they work by changing the source or target of actions that perform input-ouptut operations--that is, that read from or write to a file or device. You have to actually perform some action.\n\n*file1 > file2 is a valid command, under some circumstances, but it doesn't copy file1 to file2. Instead, as l0b0 says, it attempts to run file1 as a program or script, and--whether or not that succeeds--sends the standard output from running file1 into file2. (If file2 is a regular file, it gets overwritten.)\n\n*It's tempting to think something like <file1 >file2 would work. But it does not: when you leave off the command, no operation is performed. file1 is used as input and file2 is used as output... but since nothing is actually done, the output is empty, the only effect is to (a) create file2 if it didn't already exist, or (b) make file2 empty if it did:\nek@Ilex:~$ echo foobar > file1\nek@Ilex:~$ echo quux > file2\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file1\nfoobar\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file2\nquux\nek@Ilex:~$ <file1 >file2\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file2\nek@Ilex:~$ file file1 file2\nfile1: ASCII text\nfile2: empty\n\nYou probably just want to run cp file1 file2.\nAssuming, that is, that file2 is a regular file (or doesn't exist but you want it to exist as a regular file after your command runs), you should probably simply use the cp command.\nAs Sylvain Pineau says, you can use cat file1 > file2 as well. However, the cp command is well-behaved when writing to a file that already exists: it overwrites the target with the source, but keeps the target's original permissions mask (and therefore is good even in situations where one might intuitively think cat file1 > file2 were needed):\nek@Ilex:~$ echo glockenspiel > file1\nek@Ilex:~$ echo flugelhorn > file2\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file1\nglockenspiel\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file2\nflugelhorn\nek@Ilex:~$ chmod +x file2\nek@Ilex:~$ ls -l file1 file2\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ek ek 13 Sep 16 03:28 file1\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ek ek 11 Sep 16 03:28 file2\nek@Ilex:~$ cp file1 file2\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file2\nglockenspiel\nek@Ilex:~$ ls -l file1 file2\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ek ek 13 Sep 16 03:28 file1\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ek ek 13 Sep 16 03:28 file2\n\nTo append, you probably do want a (different kind of) redirection.\nBoth the cp command and redirection with > will overwrite the contents of a regular file, if it exists. But >> redirection appends.\nSo if you want to append the contents of file1 to file2 instead of overwriting file2 with the contents of file1, a redirection with >> (not >) is a good choice:\nek@Ilex:~$ echo 'Violets are blue.' > file1\nek@Ilex:~$ echo 'Roses are red.' > file2\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file1\nViolets are blue.\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file2\nRoses are red.\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file1 >> file2\nek@Ilex:~$ cat file2\nRoses are red.\nViolets are blue.\n\nA: To expand on @SylvainPineau's answer, the reason you can't do /root/Documents/text1.txt > /root/Documents/text2.txt is that the thing separate from the redirect operator and the file after it has to be a command. When you execute /root/Documents/text1.txt > /root/Documents/text2.txt you are telling the shell to execute /root/Documents/text1.txt, which probably won't even run since text files shouldn't have the execute flag set, and save standard output to /root/Documents/text2.txt. Since standard output from that \"command\" is empty the target file will be empty.\n\nA: Command output Redirection :\nls > file.txt\n\nls gives a directory listing and the output of ls command is redirected to file.txt .\nError Redirection :\ncommand 2>~/Desktop/errorsfile.txt\n\nThis will redirect the error result of command to a txt file. \nFor file content redirection :\n\n\n*\n\n*cat file1 > file2 (will copy the content of file1 to a new file file2)\n\n*cat file2 >> file1 (here will copy content of file2 to an existing file file1 without deleting its content )\n\n*cat file1 file2 > file3 (This would add the contents of ' file1 ' and ' file2 ' and then write these contents into a new file named ' file3 ' )\n\n\nI would also like to add The Input Redirection :\n$ mail -s \"Hello World\" user@yourmaildomain.com < /home/user/mailcontent.txt\n\nHere if the mail body is in a file then we can use it directly to send the mail.\n\nA: As others have already stated, you're missing a command. Here are some interesting combinations:\ncat <file1.txt >file2.txt\ntail <file1.txt >file2.txt\nhead <file1.txt >file2.txt\nwc -l <file1.txt >file2.txt\nbase64 <file1.txt >file2.txt\nbase64 -D <file1.txt >file2.txt\ngzip -c <file1.txt >file2.txt\ngunzip -c <file1.txt >file2.txt\n\nThe spirit of piping/redirecting indicates that a command (such as copying, extracting, counting, encoding/decoding, compressing/decompressing) is needed to specify the action to transform the input file1.txt into output file2.txt.\n", "Q: kernel / initd boot settings I have 2 seperate harddrives in my pc, one with windows 7 (working) and one with ubuntu.

It will be helpful if anyone can teach me if it can be done on terminal as well as GUI.\n\nA: i guess you are complete unaware of nat ip and main ip. the nat or network ip is the assignation of the local computer done by the router.if you visit the web and then there's nothing to do with your local ip.to know your main ip just google myip and it will come out with many sites showing your main ip which is given by your isp.\nto be anonmous i suggest to go to \nhttps://www.torproject.org/\nand download tor for your system and  run the software and now google myip and now you will get the differnce in ip.\n\nA: Most internet users are sitting behind NAT, so it's equal which IP adress you have locally. NAT changes your local IP addres to your routers global IP adress. If you want to change your local IP adress see the Ubuntu Wiki. If you want to anonimize your global IP-Traffic (e.g. WWW,Email) you must use an anonimizing technology like VPN, Proxy or TOR.\n\nA: You can add anonymoux addons for your browser to change the IP for specific sites.

If you want to use more of it, run applications that use more RAM. Or run more instances of the ones you currently do. That's the point of having more RAM. You can run bigger and more.\nYou essentially have a supercomputer. Do supercomputery things with it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtualise out, so it presents as a number of virtual servers for smaller tasks. VMWare, Xen, etc. You lose an overhead for each node but it's easier to separate tasks out to discrete amounts of resource.\n\n*Run large computational problems.\n\n*Run a service that allows other people to run their computational problems.\nBut essentially you're looking at this the wrong way. If you have to ask what you're going to do with this machine, it's probably the wrong machine for the job.

This is not a bug: even if no remote units have ever joined, the fact of the unit's participation can be detected in other hooks via the relation-ids tool, and the -broken hook needs to execute to give the charm an opportunity to clean up any optimistically-generated configuration.\n\nThe 1st scenario specifically says which events triggers the relation-broken hook (i.e., when all the particular relations with the remote service-units are destroyed). \nBut the 2nd scenario does not specifically say when this hook get triggered. Can anyone provide an example which events trigger the second scenario.\n\nA: It is possible to deploy services without any units and to relate to services which may not have any units.

You end up with files you yourself cannot edit or delete, and software running as you won't be able to modify it either, leading to more problems.\nWhat is the best solution?\nThere is an alternative: gksudo.\nThis variant of sudo will set up environment variables, such as the home directory, in such a way that makes running graphical applications as root a lot safer and won't confuse programs into creating root-owned files in your home directory.\nWhy does this affect graphical applications?\nThis doesn't just affect graphical applications, nor does it affect all graphical applications.  It affects applications that store configuration inside the current user's home directory.  This is just more common among graphical applications.\nSometimes applications will be able to detect if they're run with sudo and adjust their behaviour accordingly, but this is not common with graphical applications which are usually not expected to be run with sudo.\nHow do I fix the problem?\nYou'll need to find root-owned files and directories within your home directory and remove them.  It's better to remove them than change their ownership in my opinion, as they were not intended for your user, but the root user, so there may be unexpected effects if you simply change ownership.  You can of course back them up in case you decide there's something you want in them later.\nTo find root-owned files in your home directory:\nfind ~ -user root\n\nIf you are still having problems with some applications (run as your user), try rebooting to clear out /tmp and anything still running.  Occasionally some applications might have corrupted their existing config files and need you to remove all their configuration in your home directory, but hopefully this won't be the case for many.\n", "Q: Google Chrome Kiosk Fullscreen Issue Basic Server 14.04 I'm a complete newbie when it comes to Ubuntu and Linux in general so please be gentle.\nI've been tasked with creating a web kiosk at work and i'm all but there except from as the title suggests...Google Chrome will not load full screen...it will load half a screen all on the left side and on the right side all black.

I have tried but failed to find proper information about xinit, in order to understand why it is that when boot into Unity and then start an application (xbmc) all is well, but when I try to use a /etc/init script for auto starting the same program, I get no sound. (I have previously asked a more general question about my 'no sound' problem, but since I have not received any answer yet, I am trying to do some detective work on my own.)\nAs far as I can understand, the script (here in full) basically changes user into USER and then starts the program (xbmc):\nscript   \n exec su -c \"xinit /usr/bin/xbmc --standalone -- -nocursor :0\" $USER   \nend script\n\nAnyone willing and able to explain to me what my possibilities are for controlling the sound when booting 'directly' into a program like this? Can I go in via a virtual terminal, ssh or what have you, and check what is going on? All advice (including how to further clarify the question, if need be) appreciated.\nEDIT:\nI am guessing that a potential source of the problem might be if the script runs too soon in the startup process, so that the program starts before the sound card is initialised or something.\nIn that case, this part of the full script might be relevant for my problem:\nstart on (filesystem and stopped udevtrigger)\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nBut I do not know how to check if this might be the cause. \n\nA: Try to have something along the lines of:\nstart on stopped rc RUNLEVEL=[2345]\nstop on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[016]\n\nThat is the rough equivalent of $all in LSB init scripts. If it really is an ordering problem, then this will probably fix it.\nBut first, set the xbmc job to \"manual\" then start it after the boot is over to see if it is an ordering issue (if you still get no sound then the start and stop on are fine).\n\nA: I have found a workaround which solves the problem for me, in the sense that it:\n\n\n*\n\n*allows me to autostart in xbmc\n\n*restarts xbmc if the program crashes\n\n*it fully functioning: there is sound and the video is working perfectly.\n\n\nWhat I chose to do was to auto-start Ubuntu into my 'xbmc' user the 'normal' GUI way by selecting the option in Unity. Then, I added a process monitor script to respawn the program for me. \nHere is how: Following this answer, I added a the following script to the home directory of user 'xbmc', naming it 'process_monitor.sh':\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ -z \"$1\" ]];then\n    echo \"ERROR: must specify program\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nwhile (( 0 == 0 ));do\n    $@ &\n    pid=`jobs -l | awk '{print $2}'`\n    wait $pid\ndone\n\nAfter making the script executable by\nchmod a+x ~/process_monitor.sh\n\nI added the following line in \"Startup applications\" for user 'xbmc' (accessed through Dash or, in 12.04 at least, the top right bar):\n/bin/bash ~/process_monitor.sh /usr/bin/xbmc\n\nThis way, I can now auto-start in xbmc with perfect sound and video functionality, and then have the monitor script make sure that xbmc respawns when it crashes. Perhaps not the most beautiful of solutions, but it works!\n", "Q: How to know whether Ubuntu is installed in Win or next to Win? How can I figure out how was a Ubuntu operating system installed, i.e., inside Windows or next to Windows, assuming I don't have any knowledge about the time of installation and the process undertaken?\n\nA: I can think of two easy and dirty ways... When installed through windows, wubi will select windows as the default operating system, so in the GRUB menu it would appear as first. Another way is to look in the windows control panel, in the uninstall section. If ubuntu is one of the programs and is available to uninstall, it was installed through wubi.\nAs I understand wubi installs ubuntu in the same partition as the one in which windows is and you should be able to see this in a partition manager program(not from ubuntu itself, from a live session for example, or from windows). If there are multiple partitions on the disk (besides the system reserved created by windows and the proper windows one) ubuntu was installed next to windows.\n", "Q: Compare two repos - a table of all all package versions?

A very common issue people have with cron is that they make expectations about the environment the script runs in. They assume the script will run in their home directory.\nThat's exactly what you're doing. All your sed commands use relative paths so they work when you're in the correct directory... But is cron in the same directory? Probably not.\nYou have a choice of fixes here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use absolute paths in all your scripts commands like /home/bob/dir/file\n\n*Make your script cd into the right directory (use an absolute path) at the top of the script.\n\n*Make your cron command cd into the correct directory before operating, eg:\n00 00 * * *   cd /home/bob && ./update.sh\n\n\nOn the comment about permissions, if you don't have write permissions to do an in-place sed, you could just output to somewhere where you do have write permissions, eg:\nsed \"s/tk[0-9]*;/tk$company_id;/1i\" resources/sql/create_tk.sql > $HOME/temp.sql\nmysql -h $mysql_host -u $mysql_id \"-p$mysql_pwd\" < $HOME/temp.sql\nrm $HOME/temp.sql#\n\nOr you could actually just pipe from the sed into mysql:\nsed \"s/tk[0-9]*;/tk$company_id;/1i\" resources/sql/create_tk.sql \\\n| mysql -h $mysql_host -u $mysql_id \"-p$mysql_pwd\"\n\nThese approaches won't change the original resources/sql/*.sql files so if you need to edit those, you need to fix your permissions issues (whatever they are; use stat filename to see what's going on)\n\nA: @Oli told you why it is probably failing so I'll just explain the sed code:\nsed -i \"s/tk[0-9]*;/tk$company_id;/1i\"\n\nThe s/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/FLAGS is the substitution operator. It will replace PATTERN with REPLACEMENT. The FLAGS (for example, g in s///g) can modify its behavior. Here, the flags are N (1 in your example) which means \"Replace only the Nth match of PATTERN (this is strange, the N flag is normally used to replace the Nth match where N is greater then 1. I don't see why it's needed here, sed will replace only the first match by default). And i which makes the match case-insensitive.\nYour second sed has the flags g and i. The i is case-insensitive matching and the g makes the replacement global, it will be applied to all matches in the current line. Without it, only the first would be replaced which is why I don't see the point of the 1 flag in the previous example.\n\nA: You're not totally right regarding the meaning the sed options. Let me first explain them then we will understand what your code is doing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Option -i means : instead of displaying the result of the sed processing on the terminal, write it to the file.\n\n*s/ syntax is s/regexp/replacement/. It means sed will substitute the strings matching the regular expression (regexp) by the content of replacement. \n\n\nThe characters after the last / are modifiers, they affect how sed will process the lines :\n\n\n*\n\n*/g means \"Apply the replacement to all matches to the regexp, not just the first.\"\n\n*/1 means \"Only replace the first match of the regexp.\"\n\n*/i for case insensitive\n\n\n/gi and /1i are combinations of those.\nSo in your code, this line :\nsed -i \"s/tk[0-9]*;/tk$company_id;/gi\" resources/sql/create_tk.sql\n\nwould translate (read as one sentence) :\n\n\n*\n\n*In the resources/sql/create_tk.sql file (-i option)\n\n*substitute (s/)\n\n*all strings (/g)\n\n*starting with tk (upper or lower characters /i), eventually followed\nby a number, then followed  by a semi-colon\n\n*by the string tk followed by the content of variable $company_id followed  by a semi-colon\n\n\nSource : https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/The-_0022s_0022-Command.html and sed's man page.\n", "Q: How to use Caps Lock as Enter in 14.04?

I'd like to use Indicator-Remindor, but it doesn't seem to be available for 14.04, at least not in the Software Centre.

Why?\nI'm trying to start the program 10 seconds into the boot of Ubuntu.  When I use simply sleep 10; python /opt/splashtop-streamer/SRStreamer.pyc the application does not start.  When I use sh -c sleep 10; python /opt/splashtop-streamer/SRStreamer.pyc the application comes up with the error message that another copy is already running, I click okay and it quits.  \nHowever it may be important to note that when I'm not booting up the sleep 10; python /opt/splashtop-streamer/SRStreamer.pyc command works fine.\n\nA: I recommend that you try dumping this into a script instead of a single command.\nI have taken the liberty of making a script for you. Feel free to use it. If not, a template is below to help you create your own:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nsleep n; #Causes computer to wait n seconds before moving on to the next line\npython /path/to/python/script.py;\n\nThis will work because it runs everything in a single sh process. Basically, it's the exact same as typing both of those commands, one after the other, into a SH prompt.\nOnce you have the script and have saved it to a safe place. (I like /home/$USER/.bin/run-this.sh, run this command in your terminal (any terminal):\nchmod 755 /home/$USER/.bin/run-this.sh\n\nFinally, add it to whatever boot-time solution you want, such as \"Startup Items\", init, rc.d, or whatever.\n\nA: Also your sh -c sleep 10; should be change to sh -c 'sleep 10'; and then your command will be change to this:\nsh -c 'sleep 10' && python /opt/Splashtop-streamer/SRStreamer.pyc\n\nIf you want to run your script with 10 seconds delay.\n\nA: Since you're using Startup Applications for this, starting the program 10 seconds after login is what happens, so you could use an Upstart session job instead. \nCreate a .conf file in ~/.config/upstart (create the directory if needed), containing:\ndescription \"Splashtop Streamer Service\"\nstart on desktop-start\nstop on desktop-end\n\nrespwan\n\npre-start script\n    sleep 10\nend script\n\nexec python /path/to/python/script.py\n\n(Call it splashtop.conf, for example.)\nThe greatest advantage is that Upstart will respawn the program if it crashes, and you can control it using the start and stop initctl commands:\nstart splashtop\nstop splashtop\n\n", "Q: How to add online accounts behind transparent Squid proxy? I am behind a transparent proxy (squid) and whenever I try to add an account e.g: facebook, google, etc., this is what appears. This does not happen when I connect to the net directly.\nAny suggestions or workarounds?\n\n\nA: \nAll parts of this answer have been re-worded from Fossfreedom's Answer available here. You should read it, as it gives picture examples and gives a solely command-line method as well.\n\nInstead of running a proxy by using the GUI settings menu, you can use DConf.\nFirst off, install dconf-tools and run dconf-editor in a console. It should open a GUI.\nUnder org.gnome.system.proxy, set the proxy mode to manual. Check use-same-proxy.\nIn http and https, set your according proxy settings. \nRelog/reboot and it should be solved.\n\nA: Transparent proxies are for unsecured (e.g. HTTP) connections only. \nAdding accounts is done with HTTPS. \nHTTPS proxying can only be done explicitly, not transparently. Or, with great effort, you can set up a near-\"transparent\" HTTPS proxy by emulating a man-in-the-middle attack. (Search the web for \"SSL Bump\")\nYou'll need to either set up an SSL bumping proxy, or manually specify the HTTPS (not necessarily HTTP) proxy as described in the other answers relating to non-transparent proxies. \n", "Q: Bookmarks in File, aka Nautilus only open home directory I searched through the previous questions regarding bookmarks in Nautilus/File, but I don't see my question asked - apologies if I missed something along the way. \nI'm using a new install of Ubuntu 14.04.1. What's happening is that when I connect to a network place, say proxy.library.emhs.edu/data1/html, a shortcut appears in the left sidebar. When I close out, then reopen and click on the shortcut, it opens my Home folder on that server, eg proxy.library.emhs.edu/home/myacct.\nFrustrating I assure you.

How can I configure File/Nautilus to open a particular directory instead of my home folder? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: A proper bookmark, made by pressing CtrlD or other means of adding bookmarks, will create an entry in the Bookmarks section of the sidepane. This entry will remember the location you were in when you created the bookmark.

I have all my data saved on a SSD so im not loosing anything. I thought this would be the perfect time to try Ubuntu. I created a Bootable USB using PendriveLinux and now my 8GB USB is ready. I went to the Boot Menu on my BIOS and selected my USB. The screen turned black for a second and then some text popped up. SYSLINUX 4.07 EDD 2013-07-25 Copyright (C) 1994-2013 H. Peter Anvin et al and then it says boot:.  \nAny help?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete SYSLINUX file didn't work (it says no config file found).\n\n*I used pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3 \nto make the bootable USB.\n\n\nA: The Could not find kernel image: linux error typically occurs on USB flash drive Linux installations if syslinux could not find the configuration file syslinux.cfg. This configuration file is used to tell syslinux where your kernel image and initrd files are located. In the following section we will cover some of the basic things to look for if you are encountering this boot error.\n\nHow to fix Could not find kernel image: linux error:\nUse the following troubleshooting guide to assist in fixing the error.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the syslinux.cfg file exists on the USB flash drive. Depending on which version of linux you have installed to your flash drive, the syslinux.cfg file should be found at the root of the drive or within the /boot/syslinux or /syslinux directory\n\n*If a file named isolinux.cfg exists and syslinux.cfg does not, rename isolinux.cfg to syslinux.cfg\n\n*If the syslinux.cfg file does exist and your still encountering the error, open the syslinux.cfg file with a text editor and make sure that the paths to your kernel and initrd files are correct.\n\n\nNote: With newer versions of syslinux, you may need to check text.cfg for the paths to initrd and kernel in step 3, instead of syslinux.cfg\nsource\n\nA: Download the windows program \"Rufus\" to make a Bootable USB or CD from your Ubuntu ISO file, it will request to download files from internet, accept the request and continue the burning process, boot your USB via the BIOS boot order or manual boot selection. It seems to have a very high compatibility with Linux operating systems.\n\nA: If none of the above work for you, what worked for me is to NOT rename the isolinux.cfg to syslinux.cfg in the isolinux folder, the reason to not rename it is that syslinux.cfg already exists in another folder and is a completely different .cfg file (this may have changed with updates to the program, universal USB installer and how it populates/used to populate USB's with the data).  \nI went back to the top level of the USB and found the syslinux.cfg in the uui folder (USB installer creates this name for your USB drive and folder) after looking up how linux looks for the files upon boot (/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg, or /syslinux/syslinux.cfg or /syslinux.cfg) these are the only three places it looks for the file while trying to boot (1 in a boot folder, then inside of a syslinux folder, 2 in a syslinux folder on the top level of the USB (this is the reason that renaming the folder and files usually works) and 3 top level with the .cfg file not inside of a folder.  \nAlso note that the original syslinux.cfg (in the uui folder) is populated by the installer program and is NOT from the .iso file you downloaded and thus is changed/ adapted for each and every program on the list explaining why it works for some without any adjustments while others have issues. If you open the syslinux.cfg file in notepad etc. you will notice that all it does is call out the location directory /isolinux/isolinux.cfg for the beginning of the boot (preboot in a way) to redirect linux to the real boot file since it is stored outside of the default locations that linux looks for the boot file but since it is in the uui folder and not in one of the three places linux looks while booting it gets overlooked like it doesn’t exist.\nIn summary, go into the uui folder and copy the syslinux.cfg file in that folder, go back up to the top level of your USB where all the folders for the program are at and text files to read and paste the .cfg file onto the top level of your USB.

However, the ones you installed are those ~dotdeb ones (where did you get them?) and you seem to also have disabled the Ubuntu repositories (as otherwise I think libapache2-mod-php5 would try to downgrade all the packages to the versions that work with it).\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do NOT install those ~dotdeb packages, and install the stock Ubuntu versions instead (again, unsure where you got those ~dotdeb and why you need them; this is for you to decide, really).\n\n*Install libapache2-mod-php5 from the same place where you got the ~dotdeb packages, that version should work well with them.\n\n\nMaybe the issue is that your vagrant box was prebuilt and already includes those ~dotdeb, in which case I would really suggest you get another one that's built with official Ubuntu packages, this will be easier for you to work with.\n", "Q: TRIM on encrypted device with Precise I have migrated the main data to a new SSD. (Samsung 840 EVO, 120GB.) My ~ is an encrypted partition automounted by pam_mount. That is, there is a record in /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml for this partition.\nI want it to support TRIM. I know that it weakens the encryption a bit (i.e. establishes some kind of side-channel), but I hope it is acceptable.\nI've tried to enable it in pam_mount.conf.xml. One approach was to include discard to mount options, which was said to automagically allow discard on the encrypted block device:\n<volume user=\"{USERNAME}\" fstype=\"crypt\" mountpoint=\"/home/{USERNAME}\" path=\"/dev/sdb{NUMBER}\"  options=\"defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,discard\" />\n\nAnother attempt was to include discard (and also discards) in the mntoptions.\n<mntoptions allow=\"discard,discards,nosuid,nodev,loop,encryption,fsck,nonempty,allow_root,allow_other\" />\n\nNo luck. The fstrim still does not work:\n% sudo fstrim --verbose ~                        \nfstrim: /home/{USERNAME}: FITRIM ioctl failed: Operation not supported\n\nHave I forgotten anything? Would an upgrade to 14.04 solve the problem? The man cryptsetup command tells me that --allow-discards is supported, so I hope it should work. Kernel version is 3.13.0-35-generic, which seems to be OK, since version 3.1+ is required.\nThe underlying filesystem is ext4. The fstrim command works perfectly fine with unencrypted filesystems (that are also ext4), but does not work with the filesystem that is wrapped by dm-crypt (?) encryption.\nNote that the discard mount option seems to be used:\n% mount | grep ~\n/dev/sdb{NUMBER} on /home/{USERNAME} type crypt (rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,discard)\n\n\nA: Compiling a new version of pam-mount from source did the trick. I had to install a .deb of libhx28 and libhx-dev from Trusty (which is risky in general) in order to get a newer version of this library.\nYou will probably have the newer version in a newer Ubuntu out of box, so you can skip compiling. If you can, you can upgrade to Trusty. I want to stay with Precise some time.\nNow, enabling allow_discards without discard is an ugly hack. The patch just checks for the presence of a \"discard\" flag. So, I decided to put both \"discard\" and \"nodiscard\" (in this order) and hope it will do the trick.\nNow fstrim on this device works but I hope discard mount flag is ineffective. Not sure if I can test it.\nAlternatively, one might try to do some remounting, but I did not succeed with this approach.\n", "Q: Boot and Shutdown Issues on Aspire E 11 model E3-111-C0WA I am new to Ubuntu and Linux and this was to be my learning project.\nI purchased an Aspire E11 model E3-111-C0WA (cheap and had 300GB hard drive)\nUsed Linux Live USB Creator to create an install thumb drive with the following image:\nubuntu-gnome-14.04-desktop-i386.iso\nFirst I changed the boot order (usb drive first), then switch to legacy boot.\nUbuntu installed with no issues, then I opened package manager and went into an update - also with no issues.\nProblems began when I tried to shut down.

It seem a obsoleted in the root directory with all the mount point.\nFor example:\n/cdrom\n/media\n/mnt\n\nSo, why can't it change to something like this:\nNew Hierarchy:\n/mnt/temporary  #Can short it to /mnt/tmp\n/mnt/removable  #Can short it to /mnt/rmb\n\nHere's an excerpt from pathname.com for Filesystem Hierarchy.  \n\nReference:\nhttp://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#MEDIAMOUNTPOINT\n\nA: The FHS 3.0 specs (currently in beta, part of LSB 5.0) don't list /cdrom now:\n\nThe following directories, or symbolic links to directories, are required in /.\nDirectory   Description\nbin         Essential command binaries\nboot        Static files of the boot loader\ndev         Device files\netc         Host-specific system configuration\nlib         Essential shared libraries and kernel modules\nmedia       Mount point for removable media\nmnt         Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily\nopt         Add-on application software packages\nrun         Data relevant to running processes\nsbin        Essential system binaries\nsrv         Data for services provided by this system\ntmp         Temporary files\nusr         Secondary hierarchy\nvar         Variable data\n\n\nDiscussion of the new standard takes place in the LSB mailing lists. I recommend that your suggestion be posted there.\n\nConsidering your suggested mount points, and current default behaviour on modern desktop Linux distros, I think (/media/tmp) is a better option. Most systems I use now (Arch, Debain jessie, Ubuntu 14.04) mount drives on subdirectories in /media/$USER/ (presumably due to the desktop environment I use (GNOME)). Note that this mounting doesn't really distinguish between removable media and others, since partitions on the local hard disk (on which Ubuntu was installed) still get mounted in /media, so /media is, for all intents and purposes, the top location for mounting disks.\n", "Q: Configuring Ubuntu to share a folder with read-only access for guests and write for authenticated users I'm configuring a file server at work. It's an Ubuntu server where I've mounted and shared a hard disk. i.e. Via \"Local Network Share\" - samba under the hood.\nThis works fine. Users can browse to the machine from Windows. There is no need to provide credentials (before credentials were enabled and people grumbled).\nBut now I need to be able to upload files to the server. i.e. I need write permissions. But I don't want all users to be able to write.\nIs it possible to set up the share so guests can browse and read it (with no credentials) but other users can sign in and write to disk?\nI came across this post\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/354791/samba-share-with-guest-access-and-authenticated-users-for-write-access\nwhich seems to suggest that it is. But in my smb.confg file I don't see the folder I'm sharing.\nI also don't fully understand the suggestion. Some of the concepts are lost on me since I was a UI baby.\nClarification:\nFrom the perspective of Windows users I'm looking to\na) Grant read-only guest access so anyone can download files without credentials\nb) Still support authorization (for 1/2 generic users) who can upload files.\nThe reason I need this is because I want to store pdb symbols on the server and use \"symstore add\" to upload them from a Windows machine. \n\nA: If what your saying is permissions required are : user ??? , group (trusted) rwx, supplementary (named) r,public none. The only way to simulate this extra permissions is to make the files group read,public none user whatever. Then create a frequent cron job which will smartly copy users ~/.samba_upload this will be as root circumventing permissions.\n\nA: Right lets take a step back. Every file has an owner (user) and is in a group. File permissions fall into 3 categories user, group and others. Users can be added to groups. File pemisions can be Read, Write or eXecute. The command apropos list all relevant manuals, the command man followed by a command displays that commands man(ual) page. Try commands chown and chmod are of intrest as are the ownership and permisions of the directory your samba-drive is mounted to. I think your solution is to put the files into a rw group and others r, put trusted users into the files group.\n\nA: Was thinking it over and found a simple solution. The folder I'm sharing is\n/mnt/primary/primary/Public\nOn Public I right clicked and choose Local Network Share. I set the following options\n\n\n*\n\n*Share this folder\n\n*Guest access (for people without a user account)\n\n\nI moved up one directory to\n/mnt/primary/primary\nOn primary I right clicked and choose Local Network Share. I set the following options\n\n\n*\n\n*Share this folder\n\n*Allow others to create and delete files in this folder\n\n\nI also had to set a Samba User (otherwise there were no credentials to use for people accessing the primary share). I did that with\nsudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME\n\nWhere USERNAME is the name of the user with write permissions. This command asked me to assign a password with USERNAME as well.\nNow when I browse to the share from Windows I see 2 folders.\n\n\n*\n\n*primary\n\n*Public\n\n\nUsers who browse into Public have read-only access and need no credentials.\nUsers who browse into primary get a username/password prompt where USERNAME/password works. Those who sign in have write access.\nCaveat: This only works if the correct file permissions are set in /mnt/primary/primary. For simplicity I choose to grant full permissions to all users. i.e.\nchmod 777 -R /mnt/primary/primary\n\nBut obviously this is a bad idea if you are concerned about security on the ubuntu machine.\n", "Q: Damaged GRUB 2 in my laptop I have a genuine Windows 8 pre-installed on my laptop. I installed the Ubuntu in UEFI mode, using a live CD, but now the GRUB doesn't show, hence,not allowing me to boot to windows if I want to. It directly boots to Ubuntu.\nNow, I googled this problem, and I found out this link\nWhat I don't understand is, the link says to follow the instructions after running the terminal from the LIVE CD or so, but how can I run it when I don't have the GRUB, I mean, it wont even recognize that DVD.\nPlease help, I need the windows too, and I don't want to go to the service center.\nPS: After installation, Ubuntu asked for software updates, and so I did, and also at the software and updates section, I selected the proprietary driver for my AMD graphics card. Since I didn't restart in between, I cannot tell whether the problem is caused by them or not. \n\nA: First I have to say before loading Ubuntu Grub the computer need to know what device has the highest priority to boot. Usually this is the internal hard disk with the Ubuntu Grub, but you can change the device priority and set the CD to be the first device to boot so you'll boot from CD.\nTo boot from a LIVE CD  or LIVE USB, you have 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter BIOS \n\n*Use Boot Menu pressing F12 \n\n\n\nEnter The BIOS\nThe most generic way is the first one, to access the BIOS of your PC pressing DEL/ESC when PC is starting, you can follow this small tutorial: How to enter your BIOS\nOnce you're in the BIOS you have to change in the BOOT tab the Boot Device Priority and set your CD/DVD the first one, save and restart.\nYou have another small tutorial about changing device priority here: Change Boot Order Tutorial\nOnce you succesfully changed the priority, your PC should boot from CD and you'll see the Menu that says \"Try Ubuntu...\"\n\nUse Boot Menu\nIf your BIOS has this option, when the computer is starting, at the same time you can read in the bottom of the screen \"Press DEL to enter SETUP\" yo'll see \"Press F12 to BOOT Menu\".\nIf you Press F12 then it'll appear a Menu where you can select wich device boot from, so you should choose your CD/DVD drive or USB, and when the computer boot from the chosen drive, do the same as before, select \"Try Ubuntu...\"\nThis second way is easier because you avoid entering the BIOS but not all the computers has this option\n", "Q: Is there a ubuntu server menu-based network setup tool like during ubuntu install? During Ubuntu installation I enjoyed using the \"Configure the Network\" step:\n\nI always assumed that there was some dpkg-reconfigure command that would re-run this, and that if I ever wanted to use it I would just need to search for it. However, when I actually went out and looked for a way to access something like this I couldn't find anything, and from what I've been reading it looks like there may be no such thing after all. Is that right?\nTo clarify, I'm not having a trouble configuring my network adapter (so no need for a response detailing how to accomplish that.) I'm just curious if Ubuntu server has a CLI menu-interface like the one that is used during installation - and if so, how does one access it?\n\nA: As far as I can tell, this menu-based interface is part of the installer, and does not exist independently. However, if and when Network Manager 0.9.10 comes to Ubuntu, you could use nmtui,  the text user interface for Network Manager for a nicer interface. Other options include wicd-cli, part of WICD, a network management program.\n", "Q: ubuntu 13 with windows 8 and updating ubunu it disappears from booting list I have been working with Ubuntu 13 about a year and I have dual boot with windows 8.\nThen a message appeared that Ubuntu needs updates and I accepted the updates and started updating.\nAfter finishing and restarting ubuntu the machine started making load noise \nand after restarting more than one time the machine is working windows 8 only and Ubuntu disappeared from the booting list completely hope to rescue my files and programs installed because they are important to me.\n\nA: For recover your files or try to fix the system I recommend same thing, use a LiveCD or LiveUSB with Ubuntu.\nIf you don't have a CD/USB with Ubuntu here you can follow a tutorial about getting one USB Live on Windows.\nOnce you have a CD/DVD with Ubuntu just boot from CD/USB and hit on \"Try Ubuntu...\" and wait until Ubuntu loads. \nTo recover Ubuntu installation\nYou can try some things like fix/reinstall the ubuntu grub with:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\nYou can follow this tutorial Ubuntu Boot-Repair\nTo recover your files\nJust look for the internal hard disk and mount it, then copy the files you want to save to external device/cloud or where you want.

I think the services you're running are only listening on the localhost interface (lo or 127.0.0.1). By correctly configuring the relevant service you can listen on all interfaces.\nFor example, Tor could be configured thus:\nSocksListenAddress 0.0.0.0:8050\n\nApache VirtualHost definitions specify *:80, and so on.\n", "Q: CPU performance on sleep command This is rather a beginner question. I wonder what happens when sleep command is triggered from a bash script, for example. That job would still running, with less priority?\n\nA: Typically, sleep is the GNU sleep program. This program calls the GNU function xnanosleep, which in turn calls the Linux nanosleep system call. And:\nnanosleep()  suspends  the execution of the calling thread until either\nat least the time specified in *req has elapsed, or the delivery  of  a\nsignal  that triggers the invocation of a handler in the calling thread\nor that terminates the process.\n\nSo the process is, by definition, not running (whatever maybe the priority), but suspended.\nTesting this out:\nsleep 10 & ps aux | grep $!\n[1] 25682\nmuru  25682  0.0  0.0   7196   620 pts/13   SN   04:10   0:00 sleep 10\n\nThe process state is SN:\n   S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)\n   N    low-priority (nice to other users)\n\nIgnore the N, I'd guess that's how it was when it started out. So the effective state of sleep is interruptible sleep.\n", "Q: How can I connect to a server? I'm new to Ubuntu, so this may actually be quite simple. On windows I can connect to a server in my school's network by typing in \"\\\\servername.edu\" and that works fine, but on Ubuntu, I have no idea how to accomplish the same goal. I tried typing that in, but that doesn't work. I've pinged the server to verify that it is up, so that isn't an issue. How can I connect to this server like I can in Windows?\n\nA: For me, when I connect to a Windows share (call it muru-pc) on Windows by \\\\muru-pc, I can connect on Ubuntu using:\nsmb://muru-pc\n\nSo, in the Files (Nautilus) app, you can try connecting to smb://servername.edu. To do this, press CtrlL to get to the address bar, type the address and press Enter.\n\nA: you will want to start learning about ssh.\n1. Download putty.exe\n2. enter the ip address of your server into putty and your username, you will be promted for your password.\n", "Q: Format a ext2/ext3 drive with open permissions I need to be able to access an external hard drive on multiple linux computers. The drive needs to be formatted ext2 or ext3. How do I change the permissions after formatting in gparted. Or is there a much simpler option that I am missing?\n\nA: For ext* drives, the permissions are set by the permissions of the mount point. They have nothing to do with the formatting tool. And this depends on the UID/GID combination that you use across the systems. If you can use the same UID/GID combination everywhere, you won't have a problem. \nOtherwise, you can decide on a GID which is currently free on all your Linux systems, create a group corresponding to that everywhere, and chgrp the mount point and give it g+w permissions.\nA safe bet with most modern systems is the UID/GID combination of 1000/1000 - the default user id  for most normal users. The safest bet is, of course, 0/0 - the root UID/GID. Certain to exist everywhere.\n\nA: Don't use gid 0. If all machines only have a few users then examining /etc/group by hand is easiest. If that proves a daunting task look at the file adduser.conf, there is a setting called LAST_GID, this should reflect a high number  available. Try on each machine to find a common high unused group, avoid the common upper limit by a few hundreds to avoid falling foul of a future distro having a low LAST_GID. Should both of these methods fail identify a gid say 5000, backup user uid 5000. Delete user 5000 what ever their name is, but KEEP their data, if applicable just delete the group.Now create your new common group with gid 5000. Now recreate user nee 5000 or the replacement group. Using the find command identify all files across the system with gid 5000, now give all these files a new gid. Remember the old 5000 is not this new public one.\nRemember the whole system works on numerical gid, group names are a convenience mapping between gid and group name facilitated via file /etc/group and command groupadd.\n", "Q: Can't Add ppa:x2go/stable I am trying to turn a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 into an X2go server.\nI have followed the instructions here:\nhttp://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/wiki:repositories:ubuntu\nI have taken these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*su\n\n*Add the line below to /etc/apt/sources.list\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main universe\n\n\n*add-apt-repository ppa:x2go/stable\nI get this message:\ncannot add ppa: ppa:x2go/stable\nplease check that the ppa name or format is correct\n\n\nA: I would say a few things.\nFirst, I need to caution you against using the command su -- it is a bad practice that can only cause problems.  When you need administrative privileges, you should prefix your normal commands with sudo.  If you really need a root prompt, you can use sudo -i.\nNow I took a look at the x2go wiki page and they didn't intend for you to blindly add that line to the bottom of /etc/apt/sources.list.  If you're not too familiar with how Ubuntu handles packaging, you should spend some time on it.  Luckily, you don't really need to be doing any of this from the command line because Ubuntu provides a graphical way to ensure that you don't drop syntax errors in your sources.list or elsewhere.\nIn order to use the built-in tools for enabling or disabling certain repositories, try this link.  This will save you from syntax errors and from messing with system-critical files inadvertently.\nSecondly, as soon as you modify any of your ubuntu repositories, you should run:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\nAs this will refresh your package information.  After you run that, you should run\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n$ sudo apt-get -f install\n$ sudo apt-get clean\n$ sudo apt-get autoclean\n\nThis will clean up your repository caches.

I have an ssd with read/write speeds of over 500 megabytes per second and sata 3 at 6gbps though I only have a 1.9ghz amd cpu and 4gb of ram. My boot time is already top notch (7 seconds usually) but I want to know how I could use it to make everything else fly.\n\nA: Perhaps enabling TRIM for SSD may improve its speed. \n(note, I've never does this, so I don't know if it will work)\nExerted:\n\nWhy TRIM is Important\n  We’ve covered why TRIM is important before. When you delete a file on an old, magnetic hard drive, the computer simply marks that file as deleted. The file’s data sticks around on the hard drive — that’s why deleted files can be recovered. The computer will eventually overwrite the deleted files when it overwrites their sectors with new data.\nSolid-state drives (SSDs) work differently. Whenever you write a file to an SSD, the computer must first erase any data in the sectors it’s writing the data to. It can’t just “overwrite” the sectors in one operation — it must first clear them, then write to the empty sectors.\nThis means that an SSD will slow down over time. Writing to the SSD’s sectors will be quick the first time. After you delete some files and try to write to it again, it will take longer. This is a big part of the reason Google’s original Nexus 7 slowed down so much over time. Google fixed this by implementing TRIM in Android 4.3. (Android also uses the Linux kernel.)\nWith TRIM enabled, the operating system tells the SSD each time it deletes a file. The drive can then erase the sectors containing the file’s contents, so writing to the sectors will be quick in the future.\n\nSource:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/176978/ubuntu-doesnt-trim-ssds-by-default-why-not-and-how-to-enable-it-yourself/\n", "Q: shlock not found I'm trying to use a script for backing up btrfs, and it uses shlock\nhere is the script: \nbtrfs-subvolume-backup\nnow it says i need the inn package, and I've triedn installing it, but still no shlock\naccording to ubuntu man page shlock should be in inn2 package, which I have also tried with no success. \nSo where can I find that package to install (64 bit pc) or how to fix the script to have the same functionalaty without shlock\n\nA: According to the Ubuntu Packages index, it could be in the inn or inn2 packages.

(Ubuntu Touch browser) I can't seem to open the address bar or find the settings button. just trying to access my router so I can fiddle with settings. my router doesn't like chrome.\n\nA: The \"ubuntu browser\" is actually the default browser on Ubuntu Touch. It was included in 14.04 Trusty to take over running the webapps versus just opening a new tab in Firefox. The reason it didn't load your router's configuration page any better than Chrome did is because it actually uses the same rendering engine as Chrome (or, more correctly, Chromium) does. I suggest you try using Firefox instead (it should actually be preinstalled).\nAnyway, menus and such are hidden by default in Ubuntu Touch; to access them you need to swipe up from the bottom with your finger (or in this case, your mouse). \nTo access the URL/menu bar bring your mouse down to the bottom of the window, click (and hold) then drag up.

If you have a better connection then you might want to restart the installation because it probably froze. It is always a good idea to check the checksum of the downloaded iso to make sure that it is not corrupted before starting the installation. I hope this helps you a bit.\n", "Q: How to consume less power in ubuntu? I noticed when I installed Ubuntu that it consumed more power, so I want to know how to reduce power consumption.I want the steps please.\n\nA: Multiple ways are available to save power in Ubuntu, but because of instability , most of them are not enabled by default. Few things you can do to extend  battery life of your laptop are mentioned below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter into low power mode\nIn order to enter low power mode, run this:\nsudo pm-powersave true\n\n*Adjust Laptop Backlight\nOn a typical laptop dropping from full brightness to 2/3 brightness will save about 1 Watt.\n\n*Disable Unused Bluetooth Devices.\n\n*Enable i915 LVDS Downclocking\nIt  will down-clock the LVDS refresh rate. For systems that do not support LVDS down-clocking the screen can flicker.\nedit /etc/default/grub to enable it.\nchange:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nto:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i915.lvds_downclock=1\"\n\n*Enable Aggressive Link Power Management\nIt  is a mechanism where a SATA AHCI controller can put the SATA link that     connects to the disk into a very low power mode during periods of zero I/O activity and into an active power state when work needs to be done.\nEnable ALPM:\necho SATA_ALPM_ENABLE=true | sudo tee /etc/pm/config.d/sata_alpm\n\n*Use powertop\nPowertop is a power consumption and power management diagnosis tool. Use it to send the following app in \"Good\" power saving state.\n\n\n*\n\n*Webcam\n\n*Audio\n\n*DRAM \n\n*Ethernet \n\n*Wifi \n\n*Bluetooth \n\n*SATA link \n\n*MMC/SD \n\n\n*Reduce Wakeup Events\nWakeup events in applications cause an idle processor to come out of a sleep state and this consumes power.\nYou can save few  wakeups in a second. For example, just disabling the gnome-terminal cursor flash will save wakeup events.\nYou can also use Laptop Mode Tools.It  is the primary way to enable the Laptop Mode feature of the Linux kernel, which lets your hard drive spin down. In addition, it allows you to tweak a number of other power-related settings using a simple configuration file.\n\nInstall Laptop Mode Tools\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/unstable\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install laptop-mode-tools\n\nOpen it using gksu lmt-config-gui.\nSource:wiki.ubuntu.com\n", "Q: Firefox crashes after nvidia and cuda update on 14.04 I recently added CUDA to my laptop to be able to develop some parallel code I want. All went smooth and I managed to run the CUDA tests/samples with no problem. My computer seems to work fine apart from a big issue. Whenever I use Firefox to open a page it gets instantly very slow and in a matter of seconds my computer freezes.

I stop it. I put it back to test it keeps running. Then I put it on background but it keeps printing in the standard output and I can't keep working.

But there might be alternatives if you work from the start:\nsome_long_runnning_command | tail -n 1000 & pkill -STOP tail\n\nWith this method, since the tail has SIGSTOP sent to it, it won't output anything until you explicitly bring it to the foreground using fg (or something similar) and until the script has finished. Adjust the 1000 to get as many lines as you want.\nA better alternative might be grep:\nsome_long_runnning_command | grep . --color=never & pkill -STOP sed\n\nYou can signal SIGCONT and SIGSTOP to grep to start and stop the output as you want.\nThis can probably be combined with the re-attachment of open file descriptors from the SO question linked above (maybe with the script in this answer) so that this can be done with processes already opened.\n\nIf buffering is indeed a problem with grep, as Volker Siegel points out, then one might consider using a more complex set of commands. First, note that sort uses temporary files, so buffering should not be a problem for it. It will act like a combination of tail and grep - waiting until the command is finished, like tail, and keeping the entire output, like grep. Something like:\nsome_long_runnning_command | awk '{$0=\";\"$0}1' | sort -k1.1,1.1 --stable | sed 's/^;//' & pkill -STOP sed\n\nThe loss here is that you can't start and stop the output at will, and there's the huge computation expended in an useless sort, as well as the work expended in adding and removing the ;.\n\nFurther tests reveal that Volker is indeed correct:\nFor a script like (call it test.sh):\n#! /bin/bash\nfor i in $(seq 1000000); do echo $i; echo $i > /tmp/log; done\n\nand the command:\n./test.sh | grep . --color=never & pkill -STOP grep\n\nthe number in /tmp/log was stuck at 12768 (with a similar figure for .\nAnd with the command \n./test.sh | awk '{$0=\";\"$0}1' | sort -k1.1,1.1 --stable | sed 's/^;//' & pkill -STOP sed\n\nThe script ran to completion (/tmp/log had 1000000) without a peep from sed.\n\nI still haven't managed to integrate this with the GDB method, but this as it is can be made to function as a function, similar to John1024's. The problem is that you have no good way of knowing if the process has ended, since the shell only notifies you if the entire job has ended. So you'll have to use a checking function:\nfunction check ()\n{\n    local PROC=${1:-$(jobs -p %%)}\n    kill -0 $PROC 2>/dev/null && echo \"The process is still running.\" || echo \"The process is not running.\"\n}\n\nfunction bg ()\n{\n\n    \"$@\" | awk '{$0=\";\"$0}1' | sort -k1.1,1.1 --stable | sed 's/^;//' & \n    local PID=$!\n    sleep 0.1s\n    kill -STOP $PID\n    cat <<EOF\nTo get the output, do: \n    kill -CONT $PID\nTo check if the process has finished, do:\n    check $(jobs -p %%)\nEOF\n}\n\nYou could wrap the \"$@\" in another function which will notify you once the job is done, using something like notify-send or write.\nIt's been a nice exercise, but ultimately the simplest way is to redirect to /dev/null and forget the output: How to redirect the output of an application in background to /dev/null.\n\nA: This script redirects stdout to /dev/null only if the script is running in the background:\n#!/bin/sh\ncase \"$(ps -o stat= -p $$)\" in\n   *+*) : ;;\n   *)  exec 1>/dev/null ;;\nesac\nfor i in $(seq 200); do\n   echo $i\ndone\n\nThe key here is that the ps stat field has a + in it when the job is foreground.  If the + is missing, we are in background.\nIf you want to keep stdout around for some things but not others, we can create a file descriptor 3 for the discretionary output and keep stdout active  for other output.\nThe script below implements this.  It sends the loop output to file descriptor 3.  File description 3 is either stdout if the job is running in the foreground or /dev/null if it is running in the background:\n#!/bin/sh\ncase \"$(ps -o stat= -p $$)\" in\n   *+*) exec 3<&1 ;;\n   *)  exec 3>/dev/null ;;\nesac\nfor i in $(seq 200); do\n  echo $i\ndone >&3\n\nA Simple Way to Run Any Command in Background and Silently\nCreate this bash function:\nbkg() { \"$@\" >/dev/null & }\n\nThen, anytime that you want to a noisy command, say seq 200, in background, type:\nbkg seq 200\n\nThe command will be run in background and its stdout will be disposed of.\nTo make the definition of bkg permanent, place the definition in ~/.bashrc.\n", "Q: unable to create usb stick for windows 7 from ubuntu 14.04 I followed the same process which mentioned in below link to create USB stick for windows:\nHow can I create a Windows bootable USB stick using Ubuntu?\nBut WinUSB throws following error while syncing:\n\nPlease help.\nThanks\n\nA: Try dd command.\nThe dd command copies a file, converting the format of the data in the process, according to the operands specified.\nOperands:\nif=FILE -- Read from file instead of stdin.\nof=FILE -- Write to file instead of stdout\nbs=BYTES -- Read and write bytes at a time. \ncount=BLOCKS -- Copy only input blocks.\nsync -- Use synchronized I/O for metadata.\nExample:\nOpen a terminal.\nRun it:\nsudo -i\n\nfdisk -l  (Identify your usb-stick, suppose is /dev/sdb)\n\ndd if=/path-to-your-iso/Win_7_64Bit.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M; sync\n\nNote: Always clearly identify the usb-stick with fdisk -l command, improperly entering the wrong values could inadvertently overwrite the data on the hard drive.\n", "Q: How do you install Gnome Software center?

This chip is already supported by the default Linux installation, via the kernel driver named ‘ftdi_sio’ (kernel 2.4.20 and later). Therefore no driver download is required.\nHowever, as many different products from many different companies all use the same FTDI chip, each product is given a unique ‘product id’ number for identification purposes.\nThis unique product id is programmed into the chip inside the cable, so that when the cable is connected to the computer it can be uniquely identified.\nThe unique product id for the AXE027 USB cable is 0xbd90. The vendor id is 0x0403. However the default driver, ftdi_sio, as installed by most Linux distributions, only recognises a couple of (default) product ids for the FTDI chip (e.g. 0x6001). Therefore it is required to ‘patch’ the driver so that it correctly supports the AXE027’s 0xbd90 product id.\nAll three options are checked for correct operation in the same simple way – after inserting the AXE027 cable into the USB port the symbolic link file called /dev/ttyUSB0 should automatically appear within the operating system.\nNote that any application using the AXE027 cable needs to address this USB symbolic link:\n/dev/ttyUSB0\nWhich is not the same as the traditional serial (e.g. “COM1”) port link:\n/dev/ttyS0\n4.2) Linux Patch Option 2 (recommended)\nCreate a new udev rule, so that the modprobe rule is automatically applied every time the computer boots. Create a new file (e.g. using KWrite, gedit or similar text editor) named:\n/etc/udev/rules.d/99-axe027.rules\n\nTo do this, open a Terminal console and then type:\nsudo kwrite /etc/udev/rules.d/99-axe027.rules\n\nThen enter the following text (note the last two lines below should be entered as one long line) and then save the file.\n# /etc/udev/rules.d/99-axe027.rules\n# contains axe027 udev rule to patch default\n# FTDI product id to AXE027 product id (0xbd90)\nSYSFS{idProduct}==\"bd90\",\nSYSFS{idVendor}==\"0403\",\nRUN+=\"/sbin/modprobe -q ftdi_sio product=0xbd90 vendor=0x0403\"\n\nThe new rule will then always be applied when the system boots.

Anyway, loading this module has some result: your adapter is now known as a serial adapter and the ttyUSB0 created, but it is said the driver is experimental and you should ask linux-usb@vger.kernel.org to add your adapter to a correct driver (I would do that in your place, it's most probably the better way to go).\n\n\nNow, about the permission denied, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*list the /dev  folder with ls -l to find the group owning the ttyUSB0. (probably tty). It should have rw permission on it.\n\n*make the user running your app member of this group, for instance with sudo adduser theuser thegroup. It should fix the permission problem.\n\n\nAnd BTW, when the output of a command like modprobe -c is too large, you can either pipe it to less or to grep:\nsudo modprobe -c | less\n\nsudo modprobe -c | grep ftdi_sio\n\n\nA: In recent kernels (definitely with 14.04 LTS), the ftdi_sio module no longer accepts the product and vendor options. Instead, you have to manually write the value to /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sdio/new_id. You can automate it using the following udev rule:\nACTION=add, ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0403\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"bd90\", RUN+=\"/sbin/modprobe\", RUN+=\"/bin/sh -c 'echo 0403 bd90 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id'\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new rules file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-axe027.rules with the line above\n\n*Reload the rules by running sudo udevadm control --reload. Or reboot.\n\n*Unplug the device if plugged in.\n\n*Plug the device in.\n", "Q: Redirecting shell script output to a spreadsheet in sharepoint portal I need to write a shell script that takes some statistics related to system and those values should be redirected to a spreadsheet in share point which then presented as a graph. Which is the best way to redirect output of shell script to spreadsheet in share point that updates dynamically?\n\nA: If you need a xlsx spreadsheet, take a look at this question where I present two packages to create such files. A simple script could take your bash output to render a spreadsheet. I'd suggest to first look at this simple example (in perl).\nThere is also a well known tool called RRDtool for such a task:\n\nRRDtool (acronym for round-robin database tool) aims to handle\n  time-series data like network bandwidth, temperatures, CPU load, etc.\n  The data are stored in a circular buffer based database, thus the\n  system storage footprint remains constant over time.\n\nRRDtool can render your system metrics this way:\n\nSource: http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool\n", "Q: Switching an already installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS from Legacy to UEFI Boot mode I have a new Acer Aspire V3-572 with a pre-installed Windows 8.1. I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS alongside Windows in UEFI boot mode, however, the systems gives me the following message \"System doesn't have a usb boot option\" whenever I try to boot from the usb. I modified the Boot priority options to detect the USBs first, but nothing has changed. \nHence, I had to switch to legacy mode to install Ubunutu, and it worked perfectly. The problem now is that Windows does not appear in the grub menu. I tried to use boot-repair and it advised me to switch to UEFI boot mode before proceeding with the \"recommended repair\". I did as advised, but now, every time I boot, it directly boots into windows. Hence, every time I need to use one of the OSs, I need to switch back and forth between Legacy and UEFI mode. I want to switch the installed Ubuntu to UEFI, but I can't due to the error message mentioned earlier. Any help with this problem would be appreciated. I have searched all the internet, and I couldn't get a perfect solution for the problem. \nThank you in advance.\n\nA: I think this is because you have to add the usb device to the list of uefi boot drives. Search over the web for guides on how to do that. \nOnce you can start a live distro from your usb drive in Uefi mode, you can use boot-repair in it and solves your problems.\nThis works for me ;)\n", "Q: cannot install packages I have trouble install packages with apt-get.

It'll tell you exactly what the problem is and that should give you a fairly decent idea of what you need to do.\nBut for root issues, there's a little block in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n# Authentication:\nLoginGraceTime 120\nPermitRootLogin without-password\nStrictModes yes\nThat's the default and it means it'll only allow SSH key based authentication for root.\nIt won't allow you to log in with a password.\nObviously you could change the setting to yes but you're starting to unravel the security of Ubuntu.

I'd like to see it.\nHow can I see the information on tty1 during shutdown?\n(I already tried Ctrl+Alt+F1 in vain.)\n\nA: Do you mean you want to see shut down messages?\nUsually all you need to do is to press Esc when the Ubuntu logo shows up.\n", "Q: How to delete broken packages in ubuntu I can not remove broken package.

I can not install synaptic. Any ideas how can I remove the broken package ?\n\nA: \nNOTE: The following command will remove the installation and removal scripts including the list files. It won't remove the package, nor it will fix anything, it will just make dpkg forget about the error message.\n\nrm /var/lib/dpkg/info/<package_name>.*\n\nexample:\nrm /var/lib/dpkg/info/elasticsearch.*\n\nA: If you have a broken dependency (which I have encountered with openjdk), you will want to purge the package and force it to skip over dependency problems:\nsudo dpkg -P --force-depends package_name\n\nI found the answer on another forum\n\nA: None of the above worked for me.  Eventually I edited /var/lib/dpkg/status\nand removed the packages from there.\nHowever, I would not advise this.  It's just an option if all else fails.\n\nA: Open your terminal , and paste these line after line \nsudo rm -rf  /var/cache/apt/archives/nodejs_0.10.28-1chl1~trusty1_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nthen try again \n\nA: Here's one:\nupdate your package list like this\n sudo apt-get update\n\nthen cleanup any partial packages \n sudo apt-get autoclean\n\nNow clean the apt cache\n sudo apt-get clean\n\nNow remove any unnecessary dependancies \n sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nfrom the command above, you can identify any broken packages and forcefully remove it like this\n sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq package_name\n\nFinally mopup any other packages with dependacies \n sudo apt-get -f install \n\nTell me how it goes.\n\nA: The same error repeats If we do apt-get clean and apt-get -f install unless we remove the junk data from /var/lib/dpkg/status file in Ubuntu.\nSuppose we need to remove apache broken package. Initially we have to open the status file and search for the package apache. Remove the entire package description and save the status file. Then try using apt-get -f install and apt-get clean.\n\nA: None of the above worked for me\nI used sudo aptitude.\nIt found the error immediately and offered options. You select and it fixes it.\n\nA: Open your terminal and use following command \nsudo dpkg --purge nodejs-legacy\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nIt should solve your problem.\n\nA: I've found that:\nsudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq <packagename>\n\nWorks best.   If it gives you an error that it won't remove a package because it is depended on by another package, remove that other package as well.   You'll have to repeat this step several times and then reinstall your deleted packages.\nThe force-remove-reinstreq is THE \"nuclear option\" of deleting a package.  It only fails if there is another package depending on the one you're about to delete -- Again, in that case, deleted the depending package too.\n\nA: This fixed my problem:\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/nodejs_0.10.28-1chl1~trusty1_amd64.deb\n\n\nA: run this command to remove broken packages in ubuntu.  \nsudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq package_name \n\nafter removing package update your system with command \nsudo apt-get update\nrestart system after successfully updation.\n\nA: I had a problem with broken kodi package. I opened synaptic package manager and used the \"broken\" filter to locate the package and marked it for complete removal. It worked like a champ.\n\nA: *\n\n*query all the packages that are installed today or yesterday\nawk -v foo=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d') -v bar=$(date -d \"yesterday\" '+%Y-%m-%d') '($1==foo || $1==bar) && $3~/^install$/ { print $4 }' /var/log/dpkg.log\n\n\n*wine-qqintl:i386 caused the problem, so I remove the package\nsudo dpkg -r wine-qqintl:i386\n\n*done.\n", "Q: How can I convert a ready Python project into DEB I am using package guide of Ubuntu (http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/packaging-new-software.html), but I am stuck in compilation stage.

Also on launchpad, the project build always fails.\n\nA: In an answer to a slightly different question, I mention stdeb. If your project is packaged on PyPI you can:\n# enable proposed repos first!\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python-stdeb\nsudo pypi-install xxxx\n\n(where xxxx is the PyPI name)\nIf it's packaged (for setuptools, etc) but not on PyPI you can still use py2dsc (which ships with stdeb) which can convert a .tgz of your project into a deb file.\nYou can read more about this with more example on stdeb's PyPI page.\nIf it's not packaged or on PyPI, then yeah, you've got the \"proper\" route ahead, though you can side-step a lot of the process with this wonderful answer. You don't need to recommit everything into BZR and upload it just to build a deb.\n", "Q: Program an applications print files i wanna make an app that get files and print it.how can i do that ? with which program language ? \nthis program is like to get file from any protocol and read last line of it and print it automatically.\nthanks\n\nA: In very simple terms you can print with the lp command. Pass it a file and it'll print it.\nlp testfile\nlp <(echo \"this is a test\")\n\nThere are a ton of options but there you go.\nThe file selection and programming language are really up to you.

Sorry but your fault). \n\n*It won't be simple; you are going to have to learn the hard way or pay for data recovery service from people who know what they're doing.\n\n*Forget the urgency, this is going to take hours on end.  \n\n*If you really stomped your previous NTFS file system with a fs based on ext3 or ext4, you probably are going to need to dig deep into your TB drive to recover the data that still is there, provided you have not gone on using that drive.  \n\n*The way to go:\n\n*\n\n*don't use your HDD, i.e. don't write anything on it. In fact the best would be to take it OUT of your machine and to temporarily make an external drive out of it, for the sake of data recovery.  \n\n*become familiar with the likes of testdisk, photorec and foremost.\nThere are other free packages out there. Just stick with one at a time and two in a row. It usually is enough, provided you choose them for their complementarity.  Photorec is format and fs independent. I recommend using it in conjunction with testdisk.  \n\n\n\n-Follow-up 1-\nIf you use TestDisk on your HD with the data to be recovered (vol A), for instance by recovering lost partitions, etc., you might screw up your existing Lx partition table(s) on that drive, so I urge caution !. To avoid that I would recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*acquiring a new volume (vol B) on which to store yr recovered data, i.e. the data to be recovered from yr 1TB HD (vol A).   \n\n*the new storage volume must big enough for a complete recovery of your data, plus 15%, plus 20 GB for a new Lx OS on it. That is so you can operate faster than you would from a burned DVD containing a Live Lx on it. Evaluate how many GB of data are to be recovered to work out how big volB must be.\n\n*replace your present 1 TB HD (vol A) inside your machine with the new drive (vol B).   \n\n*format and install Lubuntu 14.04 (lighter) or Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 (bigger) on it, as well as Photorec and TestDisk.\n\n*optional:  include a partition on vol B with the same format as the one previously adopted by you for your data under Win 8, although normally both PhotoRec and TestDisk ought to write Win data recovered from vol A onto any sane Lx format on vol B.\n\n*mount vol A as an external volume (learn how to mount a volume in Lx/Ux from the console or just use the Disks application in the GUI to identify and mount it)\n\n*disable any time-based suspend/hibernate setting you may have on your OS. It might interfere with the data recovery as recovery is likely to last... \n\n*launch PhotoRec .. run your diagnosis with it so it may tell you how much time it will need to recover your files.  Note that if you have a lot of data or your data is very fragmented, recovery time may either be infinite (i.e. data unrecoverable, at least in part) or run in the hundreds of hours. You will know only when PhotoRec starts.\n\n\nPlease report in this thread on your progress.\n", "Q: Disable AMD graphic card to save battery I just bought a dell inspiron 5537 (which already comes with ubuntu 12) and I removed the ubuntu and installed Ubuntu 14.04 alongside a windows 8.1.\nAfter struggling with the system is running low on graphics error I got it fixed by installing AMD Radeon HD driver. However I noticed that before (when I had the Ubuntu 12 that came with the device) the battery life was up to 6 hours and now it's no longer than 4 hours. So now I think I should disable the AMD card (since the built-in intel HD card will work fine on Ubuntu), maybe that will extend the battery's life? \nBut, is there a trusted way to do that without returning to the low graphic mode?\n\nA: base on your description, you have the proprietary driver installed.\nYou could switch between AMD / Intel GPU by using the AMD Catalyst Control Center\nThis could be done by searching AMD in your dash\n\nAnd open the \"Administrative\" one to switch GPU. You will be asked to enter your password for it.\n\nHowever, currently there is a bug affecting it: https://pad.lv/1309550\nIf nothing happened after you entered the password.

There are several methods to set multiple images as your desktop wallpaper and change periodically. Here I am explaining a method which does not require installation of any new packages.\nFirst Goto Programs and open Shotwell. It comes pre-installed with Ubuntu.

I made an entry in crontab to run the file every 15 minutes and saved it but it would not do anything ?\ncrontab -e\n*/15 * * * * /home/marshell/graphite_cronjobs/Run_Cron_Read_Send_CapacityData_To_Graphite.sh\n\nRun_Cron_Read_Send_CapacityData_To_Graphite.sh\njava Cron_Read_Send_CapacityData_To_Graphite  >> Cron_Read_Send_CapacityData_To_Graphite.log\n\n\nA: There are two possible issues here. First of all, cron runs jobs in a special shell which does not read your personal $PATH. If java is not in /usr/bin or /bin, it will not be available to cron. From man 5 crontab:\n\nSeveral environment variables are set up automatically by  the \n  cron(8)    daemon.  SHELL is set to /bin/sh, and LOGNAME and HOME are\n  set from the    /etc/passwd  line  of   the   crontab's   owner.\nPATH   is   set   to    \"/usr/bin:/bin\".   HOME,  SHELL, and PATH may\n  be overridden by settings    in the crontab; LOGNAME is the user that\n  the job is running  from,  and    may not be changed.\n\nSo, use the full path to java instead. The next issue is that your bash script calls java on a file with a relative path. It assumes that the script will be launched from the same directory as the java file. Again, this is not the case. So, always use absolute paths for your scripts if you want them to run as expected by cron:\n/path/to/java /path/to/Cron_Read_Send_CapacityData_To_Graphite  >> /path/to/Cron_Read_Send_CapacityData_To_Graphite.log\n\nAlternatively, you can set the $PATH in the crontab itself:\nPATH=$PATH:/opt/bin\n\n*/15 * * * * /home/marshell/graphite_cronjobs/Run_Cron_Read_Send_CapacityData_To_Graphite.sh\n\n", "Q: Cannot start logkeys in ubuntu 14.04 A few days ago I installed Ubuntu 14.04 and I am a newbie on it.

If you could write to it on 12.04 you should also be able to use all the releases after 12.04 to use MTP.  I have (up to today) not have any problem using MTP with both my Cowon J3 and my S5 (all mount out of the box for several releases).\nYour problem might be fixable in 14.04.

Probably: no. 1 snag you might run into: as of 13.10 MTP support is native in Ubuntu so lots of packages created have become invalid and will conflict with older versions of MTP. From the link you added: there have been changes to UDEV rules so I am inclined to lean towards no... \nThe usual method to install software from an older release is to either (not just MTP; this is a general method. Warning: it can mess up your system if you keep adding software from older releases, fixing the problem in the current release is the better way to go)...\n\n\n*\n\n*use the PPA for that older release (if there is one) \n\n*download the debian file from that older release (and the dependencies involved) from Launchpad and use the command line tool dpkg -i to install all those debian files. \n\n", "Q: ApacheOpenOffice won't allow me to save to flash drive or network I click save in Apache openoffice I don't see a way to save to external media. Going up a level only takes me as far as the hard drive will go. \n\nA: Go up all the way (to /)\n\n\nOpen media/<USERNAME>/<DEVICENAME> then save it.\n\n\n\nThe same applies to Libre Office\n\nA: Assuming the external media is otherwise accessible (i.e., attached and successfully mounted), depending on what version of Ubuntu you're running, it is probably accessible at:\n\n\n*\n\n*/media/username/volumename, or\n\n*especially in older versions of Ubuntu, /media/volumename.\n\n\nReplace username with your actual username and volumename with the volume's label (or UUID if it has no label).\nIn practice, all you likely have to do is go up as high as you can in the folder hierarchy, then go into the folder called media. It will be somewhere in there, and usually there are only a few things there, so you should be able to find it.\n\nUbuntu, like other Unix-like operating systems, mounts all filesystems in the same directory hierarchy. Everything is somewhere under /. Empty folders1 serve as mount points, where other filesystems (which may even be on other physical disks) are attached.\nThis is sometimes confusing to users familiar with OSes that do it differently, such as Windows. (In Windows, filesystems may be mounted anywhere, but in practice are usually assigned their own drive letters.)\nIn Ubuntu, removable media are most commonly mounted somewhere inside /media. This usually happens automatically when you connect an external device.\n1: Well, they should be empty--otherwise things get confusing. You don't have to worry about that though, unless you're manually mounting filesystems with the mount command. Automatic mounts that happen when you plug a drive into your computer are always on empty folders created automatically during the mounting process.\n", "Q: How can I run original command that aliased with same name?

But I noticed that the default background photos of Ubuntu are around 2500x1600 in resolution but they all fit perfectly on my screen. How is that possible?\n\nA: It's not possible. The ratio of 2500x1600 is 1.5625 and your 1024x768 ratio is 1.1/3 or 1.33333. A typical desktop at 1366x768 is 1.77865 and 1200x740 is 1.62162. \nThe desktop backgrounds only appear to fit perfectly but they actually are either using the scale or the zoom setting. My best guess is that the zoom setting is the one used. You can see in this screenshot of my desktop using 1024x768 with a comparison of the photo in the foreground how the sides of the photo are cropped off and not seen when used as wallpaper. This background is included with the ubuntustudio package. \nThe actual photo files are contained in the folder /usr/share/backgrounds you can take a look at the pictures here and see how the default background photos compare to the display on your desktop. \n\n", "Q: Why do I get \"wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock\" error?

The /sbin/mount.nfs helper program is provided by nfs-common. You can install it with:\nsudo apt install nfs-common\n\nOn the other hand, if you are trying to mount CIFS, the helper program is provided by cifs-utils. You can install it with:\nsudo apt install cifs-utils\n\n\nA: It appears that nfs-common package should be installed in order to be able to mount NFS directories.\nsudo apt-get install nfs-common\n\nWhen it's not, the mounting of an NFS directory results in the error I've got.\n\nA: Try:\nmount -t nfs 192.168.1.5:/home/shared /mnt/common\n\n\nA: I was having this same problem in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I tried the nfs-common package install without any success.\nI was able to resolve the same issue you had by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going to the Linux \"disks\" application.\n\n*Clicking the USB drive I was trying to mount in the devices section (window left).\n\n*Clicking more actions under the Volumes filesystem partition section (two little gears right of the minus/plus signs).\n\n*Clicking edit mount options (top of the mount options window).\n\n*Clicking to TURN ON Automatic Mount Options.\n\n*Then clicking the mount button (+ sign under volumes) -- this should change to a square.\n\n\nThis mounted my USB drive and resolved the issue.\n", "Q: How to identify unused PPAs? Let's say I want to verify if some PPAs aren't being used so I can minimize conflicts or whatever else could happen. Is it possible to verify which PPAs are no longer in use?\n\nA: One method is to use Ubuntu Software Center. Open it and use the arrow down next to \"installed\". It will list (from bottom up) PPA's installed:\n\nWhen you click on a PPA (TLP as an example) it will list the software included in this PPA. A green 'tick' means the software is installed.

Tapping in that area has no effect either. The end is variable, too. It lies roughly between  a[1]=8600 and a[1]=10200, depending on the speed of the swipe.\nI tried to calibrate the screen with xinput_calibrator, but it does not respond to taps on the first crosshair, which is in the upper left part of the screen.\nIs this a driver issue, a problem with X, or could my sensor be broken?\n\nA: After testing the display on windows with the same results, I came to notice a hardware defect.

If not, check if there is a system shortcut for some keys and then do that.\nWhat currently happens:\nI have F11 set as 'toggle fullscreen' in the settings menu for keyboard shortcuts. In Chrome F11 should activate Chrome's own fullscreen mode, but instead is overridden by the system-wide shortcut, i.e. Chrome becomes fullscreen (GNOME panel and title bar vanish) but does not enter Chrome's fullscreen mode (where the tabs, address bar and bookmarks bar also vanish).\n(Side note: Firefox does not have the same problem, but this seems to be because FF fullscreen is the same as/is triggered by the window manager fullscreen)\n\nA: Disclaimer: This is not exactly what you want, but I've spent too much time on this not to post it and maybe someone else can use it.\nI got as far as Ctrl + F11 is fullscreen everywhere but Chromium where it is Chromium's fullscreen !\n\n\n*\n\n*Train of thought\n\nI thought I might be able to trick the window manager if I use xdotool and send the command directly to the chrome window - to no avail.\nThen I thought I might be able to change the keyboard shortcut in google chrome, but that seems hardcoded - another dead end.\n\n\n*Which leaves us with this\n\nInstall xdotool to simulate keyboard presses\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nreconfigure the Ubuntu Keyboard shortcuts to something arbitrary, that we never type but is usable in the script\nSettings -> Devices -> Keyboard\nScroll down and edit Toggle fullscreen mode to Ctrl + Alt + 1 and then hit the + and add a custom keyboard shortcut\n\nand then hit the + and add a custom keyboard shortcut\n\nedit the script \nnano /home/user/fullscreen.sh\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nwindowname=$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowname | cut -d \"-\" -f 2)\nif [[ $windowname != *\"Chromium\"* ]]\nthen\nxdotool keydown Ctrl keydown Alt key 1 keyup Alt keyup Ctrl\nelse\nxdotool search --onlyvisible --class \"Chromium\" windowfocus \nsleep 0.2\nxdotool key F11\nfi\n\nmake it executeable\nchmod +x /home/user/fullscreen.sh\n\n\n\n\n*Conclusion\nIt seems impossible to trick the windowmanager and smuggle keystroke by, but there are certainly workarounds possible. In this case Google made the fullscreen keyboard shortcut non-configureable, so it falls just short of the mark\nNow with Ctrl + F11 the windowmanager controls the fullscreen behavior except in chromium.\n", "Q: Can't use webcam on laptop I am using Acer Aspire 5734Z-4725 model with ubuntu 14.04.

To fix that, run chmod +x <filename> as the root user. Now, the root user can run the file using ./<filename>. \n\nCommand Not Found can mean many different things. First off, you need to have the ./ or an absolute path for running files not in your $PATH variable. (i.e../test.sh or /home/user/bin/test.sh).\nHowever, Command Not Found can also mean that a library is missing. Check that you have all the required dependancies to run that file.\n", "Q: What's wrong with DVD burning?

Even Win'98 had explicit ways to change administrator username!\n\nA: You can create a new user with the correct details and admin rights, log out and log in again with the new user and then copy your old data if any and delete the old user.\nAlternatively, you can install gnome-system-tools or kuser to do this. These packages provide more advanced GUIs to deal with user accounts.

To do this, create three new partitions on your HDD(make sure your wubi installation will fit into those partitions). I have reduced my boot time from 40 secs to 18 secs.\nFirst step(do this on a live CD)\n-Issue sudo dd if=<path-to-your-wubi-rootfs-imagefile> of=/dev/sda3 bs=512 from a Ubuntu or another Linux live cd in a terminal. Moving installation in this manner works, I had made a similar VM-to-real PC transistion. Do not copy swap partition, recreate it instead. Separate your home directory into a ext4 partition by using your favorite partition editor(GParted is available on Ubuntu Live) and a file manager(move files from your rootfs's /home directory to newly created partition-nautilus or mv <path1>/home/* <path2>/ will help in such a case). You can share Documents directory among Windows and Linux.(this unfortunately does not apply to home directories). After moving rootfs and creating the other partitions, now you can install GRUB2 by grub-install --boot-directory=<rootfs-partition-mount-point>/boot /dev/sda.\nSecond step(do this on your new destination)\nDo a UEFI conversion according to steps described here: How can I change/convert a  Ubuntu MBR drive to a GPT, and make Ubuntu boot from EFI? Be careful about not losing ability to boot Microsoft Windows. Try disabling IPv6 after moving your installation outside WUBI. WUBI is the primary cause of slowdown here.\n\nA: You can disable IPv6 if you don't need it. There are a few configurations, where IPv6 can significantly slow down startup time.\nAs root user or preprend with sudo:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\n\n*echo \"net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\" > /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-ipv6.conf\n\n*echo \"net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\" >> /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-ipv6.conf\n\n*echo \"net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\" >> /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-ipv6.conf\n\n*sysctl -p\nThen reboot and tell us if it worked. Did fine for me. You can also blacklist the ipv6-module, but I'd recommend not doing so because other modules might need it to function properly.\n", "Q: Whitelist IPs for ufw I have set some rules in ufw to rate limit connections, as such:\n-A ufw-user-input -p tcp --dport 25 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set\n-A ufw-user-input -p tcp --dport 25 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 6 --hitcount 12 -j ufw-user-limit\n-A ufw-user-input -p tcp --dport 25 -j ufw-user-limit-accept\n\nThese are in: before.rules\nI would like to white list IPs from being subject to these rules.

What is the best partition size to make for linux.\n\nA: It can depend on many factors such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you use Windows more than Linux on a daily basis?\n\n*Are you are gamer and have, play or test many games?\n\n*Do you work on a Windows environment more than a Linux one?\n\n*Are you installing Ubuntu just to learn about Linux or have in mind moving to it eventually?\n\n*How much space is already used by Windows?\n\n\nDepending on this type of questions and any other you might start thinking, the size can change a lot. If this is your first time testing Ubuntu, I suggest giving Ubuntu about 100 GB to 250 GB, just to have enough space to test how it works, install apps, games, download torrents and more.\nIf you use both about the same, then giving both half of the size is pretty good, so 500 GB for each.\nYou would also need to check how much space Windows is using and how much it has left. It is recommended, if you are going to take some space left, and you are into gaming or heavy applications, leaving at least 200 GB to 500 GB to windows for any additional apps.\nIn regards to memory, it does not matter, the 4 GB of RAM will be reflected completely on both systems.\nIf you only want to test Ubuntu for a brief moment, I would suggest the minimum of about 10 GB for it up to 50 GB. Enough to at least play around, install Steam or LAMP services and toy with it.\nBut it all depends on how you wish to use your system at the end.\n\nA: The default for Ubuntu installations on a VMWare virtual machine is 20 GB.  I would say 20 GB + X, where X is how much space you want for movies, pictures, and music on your Linux system.\n\nA: Much depends on the use to which it will give the system.\nOverall with 35-45 gigs for /, is sufficient. Primary, ext4\nTriple the ram if you fail, 16 gigs in this case for swap. Logica, swap\nFree rest for /home. Logica, ext4\nIn my case I give 35 gigs for /home and the rest for /home/user/data. Logica, ext4\n\nA: I always used 10GB for root, 20GB for /home and 1GB for swap on my laptop with 4GB of RAM and 250GB of hard drive. I use my windows NTFS drive also from Linux (for storing documents, files and pictures) and use Linux filesystem only for Linux-only files (bash scripts, Linux executables, etc). Never run out of space in neither system. \n", "Q: What application is sending notification?

I'm running VMWare ESXi 5.5 and Ubuntu 14.04.1.  I have a maas controller setup (VM) and it has two interfaces. Eth0 can see my LAN network and the Internet and eth1 is a private VM-only network for MAAS.  I created a second VM node but I can't get it to enlist.\nPXE booting is working. The node boots via PXE and gets an IP on the MAAS private network, but it hangs with the message mentioned in the post I linked to:\nutil.py[WARNING]:  Failed accessing user data.\n\nI've also tried booting from the CD and entering in the IP of the MAAS controller. The machine immediately shuts down, but never enlists.\nAny ideas how to troubleshoot this issue?\nThanks!\n\nA: OK.  Finally figured this out.  For some reason, I had the MAAS Cluster Controller API URL set to my LAN network address, not my MAAS internal network address.  \nI fixed this by running \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-cluster-controller\n\nThen I set the API URL to:\nhttp://192.168.xxx.xxx/MAAS\n\nAnd now my PXE nodes enlist properly!\nHope that helps someone out.\n", "Q: Virtual device when started in Genymotion Hangs (Force Close) on Ubuntu 12.04 My Ubuntu 12.04 uname -a is as follows,\nLinux XXX-XXXXXXXX 3.8.0-44-generic #66~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 04:04:23 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n\nI have Installed Virtual Box, version is,\n4.1.12_Ubuntur77245\nMy Genymotion Version is :\nVersion 2.2.2\nWhen I Start Genymotion, everything is ok and runs perfectly.\nBut when I start a specific Virtual Device, The Emulator just Freezes, If I close the emulator I get a \"Force Close\".\nI am not finding what the problem is.

Open the terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+t) and type sudo apt-get install gammu. Type in the password when prompted(password will be invisible).After installing gammu create the configuration file for gammu using the command   gammu-detect > .gammurc. Ignore any output in the terminal. This command will create a hidden configuration file in your home folder. Open your file browser (nautilus) and press ctrl+h to view hidden files. Check whether the .gammurc file is created.Open the configuration file created and check for the devices detected by gammu. The devices listed as ttyUSB0 to ttyUSB3 belong to the D-Link modem.Using gammu you can send ussd only if you are not presently connected to internet. So to send ussd disconnect from the internet connection.Now to send a ussd type the following command in \"terminal\" : gammu getussd \"USSD_CODE\". For example gammu getussd *125#. Then wait for some time and you will get the reply for the ussd(time depends on the network provider. Took 2 min for me!).If proper reply is not getting, add the device number along with the above command ie, gammu 1 getussd *125# or gammu 2 getussd *125# etc.'gammu 1 getussd *125#' worked for me in Ubuntu 14.04 with D-Link DWP-156.

You have done all the steps correctly from creating USB till getting into installation menu.\nRegarding your point 4, If you have open installation menu (wubi) inside windows then it will not work as wubi have been somewhat disabled to provide you safety and it will reboot. Then when you enter into the installation of ubuntu from boot menu, there you will be able use the option to \"install ubuntu along side windows\" and it should work fine.\nNow moving forward especially, regarding to your point 3 and 5. You may have shrinked the partition to create the unallocated space that's why the partition is not showing up. \nIt may also be the reason that you may more partition drives in Ubuntu (14.04). If you use the option of \"something else\" you may see that that there are 4 lines (partitions) and according to my knowledge it can not be increased.\nSo, if the problem persists you may try to reduce the partitions.\nYou can also have a look at this question and answer to get some more info.:\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nUpdate (based on new info.):\nThe Unallocated partition is not a partition, and is a space to let create a partition. Follow the answer to resolve this issue.\nYou need to create partition in Ubuntu (through 'Something Else' option). Click on the + (plus)icon in the menu that shows up. This will show that short menu to create partition. Type the size, (although it seems you want to use whole \"unallocated\" partition into Ubuntu. If yes, click on the plus button on the right side, just to be sure that the whole Unallocated partition is being used. If it does not increase then the whole Unallocated space is being shown. Note: 1Gb = 1024 MB).\nNow in the Type of partition, select Primary.  In Use as, select Ext4. And in Mount point select \"/\" (it indicates root, and is somewhat like C: drive in windows).\nNow you should be able to see the Partition you want and can continue the installation process.\nLooking forward to hear good news regarding successful installation from you. \n", "Q: hbase client running output \"Usage: mapfile infile outfile\" I have made a simple client application in java for Hbase to connect with it and show results for some queries e.g list, scan etc.\nBut When i run my application in eclispe, there are no errors but output is only \nUSAGE: MapFile inFile OutFile. \nWhy this message is appearing and what is its meaning.

Doing so is a great way to test your hardware for Ubuntu compatibility.\nYou could even install programs from the software center if you wished. It is not restricted in functionality in any way other than you will not have a HOME directory to store your data, and installed applications or application settings will be lost after a shutdown.\nBut you will find out that Nautilus does have a menu bar, now as with all other applications integrated in the top panel (\"global menu\").

It was due to an missing entry in the fstab file.\nLets say the bookmark is in folder /dev/sda1/bookmark. Then the bookmark only worked when I first opened the folder /dev/sda1 with the Explorer Window.\nAfter a restart the command lsblk -f showed that /dev/sda1 was not mounted, without mountpoint. \nAccessing /dev/sda1 in the Explorer Window and retype the command lsblk -f it appeared with its mountpoint on /media/user/sda1.\nAfter some time I percepted that an entry in the fstab file was missing. \nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nI put the following line into fstab file:\n/dev/sda1   /media/user/sda1  ntfs  rw,user,auto    0   2\n\nI used the mountpoint which was defined by the system after accessing /dev/sda1 manually.\nFinally it worked after a restart.\nI hope it will help for other cases as well.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 Disable the mounting of internal hdd (sda) I am running ubuntu from a usb stick and I would like to prevent ubuntu from seeing my internal hdd, so it would be impossible to mount.

By default, it'll most likely go into /Downloads, but if not, just know where it is.  (I've heard that this method MIGHT not work well with older cards (such as yours) but it's worth a shot.

Just that simple thing only.\n\nA: Just for fun, here is a pure bash solution which doesn't use shuf, sort, wc, sed, head, tail or any other external tools.\nThe only advantage over the shuf variant is that it's slightly faster, since it's pure bash. On my machine, for a file of 1000 lines the shuf variant takes about 0.1 seconds, while the following script takes about 0.01 seconds ;) So while shuf is the easiest and shortest variant, this is faster.\nIn all honesty I would still go for the shuf solution, unless high efficiency is an important concern.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nFILE=file.txt\n\n# get line count for $FILE (simulate 'wc -l')\nlc=0\nwhile read -r line; do\n ((lc++))\ndone < $FILE\n\n# get a random number between 1 and $lc\nrnd=$RANDOM\nlet \"rnd %= $lc\"\n((rnd++))\n\n# traverse file and find line number $rnd\ni=0\nwhile read -r line; do\n ((i++))\n [ $i -eq $rnd ] && break\ndone < $FILE\n\n# output random line\nprintf '%s\\n' \"$line\"\n\n\nA: You can use shuf utility to print random lines from file\n$ shuf -n 1 filename\n\n-n : number of lines to print\nExamples:\n$ shuf -n 1 /etc/passwd\n\ngit:x:998:998:git daemon user:/:/bin/bash\n\n$ shuf -n 2 /etc/passwd\n\navahi:x:84:84:avahi:/:/bin/false\ndaemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/bin/false\n\n\nA: Say you have file notifications.txt. We need to count total number of lines, to determine range of random generator:\n$ cat notifications.txt | wc -l\n\nLets write to variable:\n$ LINES=$(cat notifications.txt | wc -l)\n\nNow to generate number from 0 to $LINE we will use RANDOM variable.\n$ echo $[ $RANDOM % LINES]\n\nLets write it to variable:\n$  R_LINE=$(($RANDOM % LINES))\n\nNow we only need to print this line number:\n$ sed -n \"${R_LINE}p\" notifications.txt\n\n\nAbout RANDOM:\n   RANDOM Each time this parameter is referenced, a random integer between\n          0 and 32767 is generated.  The sequence of random numbers may be\n          initialized by assigning a value to RANDOM.  If RANDOM is unset,\n          it  loses  its  special  properties,  even if it is subsequently\n          reset.\n\nBe sure your file have less then 32767 line numbers. See this if you need bigger random generator that works out of the box.\nExample:\n$ od -A n -t d -N 3 /dev/urandom | tr -d ' '\n\n\nA: Here's a Python script that selects a random line from input files or stdin:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\"\"\"Usage: select-random [<file>]...\"\"\"\nimport random\n\ndef select_random(iterable, default=None, random=random):\n    \"\"\"Select a random element from iterable.\n\n    Return default if iterable is empty.\n    If iterable is a sequence then random.choice() is used for efficiency instead.\n    If iterable is an iterator; it is exhausted.\n    O(n)-time, O(1)-space algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return random.choice(iterable) # O(1) time and space\n    except IndexError: # empty sequence\n        return default\n    except TypeError: # not a sequence\n        return select_random_it(iter(iterable), default, random.randrange)\n\ndef select_random_it(iterator, default=None, randrange=random.randrange):\n    \"\"\"Return a random element from iterator.\n\n    Return default if iterator is empty.\n    iterator is exhausted.\n    O(n)-time, O(1)-space algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # from https://stackoverflow.com/a/1456750/4279\n    # select 1st item with probability 100% (if input is one item, return it)\n    # select 2nd item with probability 50% (or 50% the selection stays the 1st)\n    # select 3rd item with probability 33.(3)%\n    # select nth item with probability 1/n\n    selection = default\n    for i, item in enumerate(iterator, start=1):\n        if randrange(i) == 0: # random [0..i)\n            selection = item\n    return selection\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import fileinput\n    import sys\n\n    random_line = select_random_it(fileinput.input(), '\\n')\n    sys.stdout.write(random_line)\n    if not random_line.endswith('\\n'):\n        sys.stdout.write('\\n') # always append newline at the end\n\nThe algorithm is O(n)-time, O(1)-space. It works for files larger than 32767 lines. It doesn't load input files into memory. It reads each input line exactly once i.e., you can pipe arbitrary large (but finite) content into it. Here's an explanation of the algorithm.\n\nA: You can also use sort command to get random line from the file.\nsort -R filename | head -n1\n\n\nA: I'm impressed by the work that Malte Skoruppa and others did, but here is a much simpler \"pure bash\" way to do it:\nIFS=$'\\012'\n# set field separator to newline only\nlines=( $(<test5) )\n# slurp entire file into an array\nnumlines=${#lines[@]}\n# count the array elements\nnum=$(( $RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM % numlines ))\n# get a (more-or-less) random number within the correct range\nline=${lines[$num]}\n# select the element corresponding to the random number\necho $line\n# display it\n\nAs some have noted, $RANDOM is not random.

I can figure and judge the sizes myself, and I have tried one set-up, based on answers from similar questions in here, but it didn't work well, as I choose a few partitions rather randomly, in my lack of understanding all the partitions.\nI would like to utilize the 30GB for Ubuntu and maybe the software I'm going to install, and I've realized that keeping all documents, /tmp and other data on the HDD would be better. I have no intentions to dual-boot with Windows, which I can see many similar questions ask for.\n\nA: Keep it simple: / goes on SSD, /home goes on HDD.

Now, lsmod shows that I have the rtl8821ae driver installed, and lshw shows that the device exists but is `unclaimed', which means that the driver isn't working correctly.

That would be a waste of the display and of energy and it is hard to see that on a notebook, but can be easily seen on monitors that don't enter standby.\n\n", "Q: \"Type 'debo' is not known on line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list\" I was trying to install spotify for Ubuntu when this error appeared:\nE: Type 'debo' is not known on line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list\nE: The list of sources could not be read.\n\nI don't know what to do to solve it.\n\nA: Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list\n\nMake sure all lines begin with \"deb\" or \"deb-src\" or are comments (they start with \"#\"), there should be at least one that says \"debo\" which is a typing error.\n\nA: The most direct solution is using:\nsudo sed -i'.bk' 's/^ *debo /deb /' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list\n\nIt would remove the extra \"o\" in your sources type.

Is there some kind of a loader of some sort that could help me here and if so, how do I install it, I'm kinda of a noob here.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: My thought is that it is just automatically looking on the windows disk for an os as it is set to boot from it by default.

I had a disk with a lot of surface errors that I used until a couple days ago when I got my new ssd. I want to know how I could completely copy over my home partition but ignore all errors while doing so, as it probably has a few hundred bad clusters in the beginning and it would literally take hours just clicking \"ignore\" on gparted. Please guys, I have like 85gb in there that would be an absolute pain to recreate or manually copy all files over and correct the permissions of.\n\nA: A. To copy the files into a \"flat\" directory\nIf it is possible for the script to create at least a file list, but it should ignore the problems that might occur in copying them, it should work.\nIn case of duplicates, it will save the duplicates as duplicate_1_<filename>, duplicate_2_` etc.\nI used:\ntry\n    <copy_command>\nexcept Exception\n    pass\n\nWhich covers the widest possible range of errors.\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport shutil\nimport os\n\nsourcedir = \"/path/to/source\"\ndest_dir = \"/path/to/destination\"\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(sourcedir):\n    for name in files:\n        subject = root+\"/\"+name\n        n = 1; name_orig = name\n        while os.path.exists(dest_dir+\"/\"+name):\n            name = \"duplicate_\"+str(n)+\"_\"+name_orig\n            n = n+1\n        try:\n            newfile = dest_dir+\"/\"+name\n            shutil.copy(subject, newfile)\n        except Exception:\n            pass\n\nCopy it into an empty file, save it as giveit_ashot.py and set the sourcedir and destination.\nRun it by:\npython3 /path/to/giveit_ashot.py\n\nB. If the directory structure is important\nthen use the script below, it first tries to (re-)create the directories (top- down), then copies the files into the structure as much as possible. Again: it must at least be possible to create a file / directory list.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport shutil\nimport os\n\nsourcedir = \"/path/to/source\"\ndest_dir = \"/path/to/destination\"\n\ndirdata = []\nfiledata = []\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(sourcedir):\n    for dir in dirs:\n        absolute = root+\"/\"+dir\n        relative = absolute.replace(sourcedir, \"\")\n        dirdata.append([absolute, dest_dir+relative, len(absolute.split(\"/\"))])\n    for file in files:\n        abs_file = root+\"/\"+file\n        rel_file = abs_file.replace(sourcedir, \"\") # source\n        filedata.append((abs_file, dest_dir+rel_file)) # destination\n\ndirdata.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n\nfor item in dirdata:\n    try:\n        if not os.path.exists(item[1]):\n            os.mkdir(item[1])\n    except Exception:\n        pass\n\nfor item in filedata:\n    try:\n        shutil.copy(item[0], item[1])\n    except Exception:\n        pass\n\n\nA: gparted suggest you're creating/formatting the partition.  Not the one you have your home, I expect.\nIf the partition is already created, try to format with:\nmkfs.ext4 -c  /dev/sdXX\n\nMake sure to put the right /dev/sdXX.\nIf you're trying to copy from a bad partition to a good one, I don't know how cp would behave in the face of IO errors.\n\nA: You have to take different measures for\n\n\n*\n\n*fix bad blocks (some filesystems, like ext4 and ext3 allow this, info at man e2fsck)\n\n*copying ignoring errors (your initial question), e.g. with rsync -a --ignore-errors /path/to/mountpoint/of/broken/device/ /path/to/folder/on/working/device/\nA long shot remark: You might want to create an image of the partition with dd before you overwrite it or throw the disk away (new recovery tools might come up in some time and get more data out of the disk than current and the tips (mine included) you get to restore the files might just be wrong), e.g. do sudo dd if=/dev/sdxY | pigz -p 8 | sudo tee /path/to/a/file/on/a/working/disk.img.gz for a compressed image.\n", "Q: How can I switch between versions of an installed package with apt-get? On 12.04, I have the latest version of Ocaml (4.01) installed with all the dependencies. I'm trying to install Coq, which depends on an older version (3.12) of the ocaml-base-nox runtime (via a virtual dependency). Running apt-cache policy ocaml-base-nox gives the following output:\nocaml-base-nox:\n  Installed: 4.01.0-1ppa4~precise\n  Candidate: 4.01.0-1ppa4~precise\n  Version table:\n *** 4.01.0-1ppa4~precise 0\n        500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/avsm/ppa/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     3.12.1-2ubuntu2 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n\nOk, shouldn't be a problem, right? I just need to switch my version to 3.12 to install/use coq, then I can switch back to 4.01 when I need the newer version. It's not clear to me how to do this. After a little googling I tried the following:\n$ sudo apt-get install ocaml-base-nox=3.12.1-2ubuntu2\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information...

Furthermore, most of what I use Ocaml for (the mirage unikernal project) requires 4.0 or higher.\nSo, what, if any, is the correct way to switch between package versions? Is there a way I can force apt-get to install something without uninstalling anything?\n\nA: Yes, in fact, you probably don't have to do any of that stuff at all. Most of the time, the dependency version specified in a case like yours is for >version meaning, the specified version or any version greater. If you want to install coq, just type the following commands and apt-get will automatically call the necessary dependencies for you. To do this, open a terminal and type the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install coq\n\nIf you still have the same issue it wouldn't be a problem for you to uninstall and then reinstall those packages. Unless you use the purge command, the configuration files for the removed software will remain intact; reinstallation will restore all user settings and no additional setup should be required.\nYou can use the following command to restore those packages:\nsudo apt-get install camlp4 camlp4-extra ocaml ocaml-base ocaml-compiler-libs ocaml-interp ocaml-native-compilers ocaml-nox\n\n", "Q: sound for headphones no longer works but does work on windows Since a few days ago the sound of my headphones no longer works.

I don't understand the bash command exec. I have seen it used inside scripts to redirect all output to a file (as seen in this). But I don't understand how it works or what it does in general. I have read the man pages but I don't understand them.\n\nA: To understand exec you need to first understand fork. I am trying to keep it short.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you come to a fork in the road you generally have two options. Linux programs reach this fork in the road when they hit a\nfork() system call.\n\n*Normal programs are system commands that exist in a compiled form on\nyour system. When such a program is executed, a new process is\ncreated. This child process has the same environment as its parent,\nonly the process ID number is different. This procedure is called\nforking.\n\n*Forking provides a way for an existing process to start a new one. However,\nthere may be situations where a child process is not the part of the same\nprogram as parent process. In this case exec is used. exec\nwill replace the contents of the currently running process with the\ninformation from a program binary.\n\n*After the forking process, the address space of the child process is\noverwritten with the new process data. This is done through an exec\ncall to the system.\n\n\nA: man bash says:\nexec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments]]\n      If command is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new  process\n      is  created.  The arguments become the arguments to command.  If\n      the -l option is supplied,  the  shell  places  a  dash  at  the\n      beginning  of  the  zeroth  argument passed to command.  This is\n      what login(1) does.  The -c option causes command to be executed\n      with  an empty environment.  If -a is supplied, the shell passes\n      name as the zeroth argument to the executed command.  If command\n      cannot  be  executed  for  some  reason, a non-interactive shell\n      exits, unless the execfail shell option  is  enabled.   In  that\n      case,  it returns failure.  An interactive shell returns failure\n      if the file cannot be executed.  If command  is  not  specified,\n      any  redirections  take  effect  in  the  current shell, and the\n      return status is 0.  If there is a redirection error, the return\n      status is 1.\n\nThe last two lines are what is important: If you run exec by itself, without a command, it will simply make the redirections apply to the current shell. You probably know that when you run command > file, the output of command is written to file instead of to your terminal (this is called a redirection). If you run exec > file instead, then the redirection applies to the entire shell: Any output produced by the shell is written to file instead of to your terminal. For example here\nbash-3.2$ bash\nbash-3.2$ exec > file\nbash-3.2$ date\nbash-3.2$ exit\nbash-3.2$ cat file\nThu 18 Sep 2014 23:56:25 CEST\n\nI first start a new bash shell. Then, in this new shell I run exec > file, so that all output is redirected to file. Indeed, after that I run date but I get no output, because the output is redirected to file. Then I exit my shell (so that the redirection no longer applies) and I see that file indeed contains the output of the date command I ran earlier.\n\nA: In bash, if you do help exec:\n$ help exec\nexec: exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments ...]] [redirection ...]\n    Replace the shell with the given command.\n\n    Execute COMMAND, replacing this shell with the specified program.\n    ARGUMENTS become the arguments to COMMAND.  If COMMAND is not specified,\n    any redirections take effect in the current shell.\n\n    Options:\n      -a name   pass NAME as the zeroth argument to COMMAND\n      -c        execute COMMAND with an empty environment\n      -l        place a dash in the zeroth argument to COMMAND\n\n    If the command cannot be executed, a non-interactive shell exits, unless\n    the shell option `execfail' is set.\n\n    Exit Status:\n    Returns success unless COMMAND is not found or a redirection error occurs.\n\nThe relevant bit:\nIf COMMAND is not specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell.\n\nexec is a shell builtin, which is the shell equivalent of the exec family of system calls that G_P speaks of (and whose manpages you appear to have read). It just has the POSIX mandated functionality of affecting the current shell if no command is specified.\n\nA: exec is a command with two very distinct behaviors, depending on whether at least one argument is used with it, or no argument is used at all.\n\n*\n\n*If at least one argument is passed, the first one is taken as a command name and exec try to execute it as a command passing the remaining arguments, if any, to that command and managing the redirections, if any.\n\n\n*If the command passed as first argument doesn't exist, the current shell, not only the exec command, exits in error, unless the shell is interactive or the bash option execfail is set (shopt -s execfail). See also https://superuser.com/questions/992204/why-does-exec-non-existent-file-exits-the-shell-when-in-a-script-that-is-sourc\n\n\n*If the command exists and is executable, it replaces the current shell. That means that if exec appears in a script, the instructions following the exec call will never be executed (unless exec is itself in a subshell). A successful exec never returns. Shell traps like \"EXIT\" won't get triggered either.\n\n\n*If no argument is passed, exec is only used to redefine the current shell file descriptors. The shell continue after the exec, unlike with the previous case, but the standard input, output, error or whatever file descriptor has been redirected take effect.\n\n\n*If some of the redirections uses /dev/null, any input from it will return EOF and any output to it will be discarded.\n\n\n*You can close file descriptors by using - as source or destination, e.g. exec <&-. Subsequent read or writes will then fail.\nHere are two examples:\necho foo > /tmp/bar\nexec < /tmp/bar # exec has no arguments, will only affect current shell descriptors, here stdin\ncat # simple command that read stdin and write it to stdout\n\nThis script will output \"foo\" as the cat command, instead of waiting for user input as it would have done in the usual case will take its input from the /tmp/bar file which contains foo.\necho foo > /tmp/bar\nexec wc -c < /tmp/bar # exec has two arguments, the control flow will switch to the wc command\ncat\n\nThis script will display 4 (the number of bytes in /tmp/bar) and immediately ends. The cat command won't be executed.\n", "Q: VGA output for Old pc I have a acer 5710g, i had some problems about heating and i turned it into a media system just for downloading stuff and watching movies by removing internal screen. However i have some problems about it. It wasn't able to use it in any 16:9 resolutions, 1024x768 was maximum, Than i found a way to deal with it which is called \"xrandr\" (you would probably know what that is) However it keeps returning backwards whenever i turn on/off system.

Once you get the screen set up the way you like it, you can \"save\" the parameters to a shell script (.sh) file. You can then make the script execute at startup. http://www.ubuntugeek.com/arandr-a-simple-visual-front-end-for-xrandr.html\nYou can also look for autorandr (https://github.com/wertarbyte/autorandr).

The users have continuous updates in the dinamic pages through a Java script, downloading JSON files through Ajax request to server.

I was under the impression that this patch error affects only NVIDIA video cards but it seems that ATI video cards can have the same issues.\nSometimes open source drivers work like a charm with ATI cards, and sometimes you get funny results like in your case. To fix the problem you are supposed to remove your ATI drivers from your system, remove xorg.conf, and after that reinstall xorg completely and finally reconfigure Xorg. \nAll this operations are better performed in the console terminal, and to get to the console you have to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 at login prompt, and login with your username and password. So it would be better to write down these commands on some piece of paper before actually running them.\n  sudo apt-get purge fglrx*\n\n  sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nAnd to reinstall xorg completely:\n  sudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-core libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:amd64 libgl1-mesa-dri:amd64\n\nimmediately followed by:\n  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\nand finally\n  sudo reboot      \n\nThe following is a well documented guide addressed to fixing the proprietary ATI drivers, the one I used to address your problem.

Next you can visit Ubuntu Guide for Network Shares and follow the instructions present in there.\nYou can use the mount umount commands to be able to temporarily mount whatever you want to share until the next reboot when you have to issue the same commands again. To do that follow the next tutorial listed on this page.\nMake sure you find out how all your partitions and/or directories to be shared are listed and it would be much easier if you'd decide to install a file manager with full network sharing capabilities like Dolphin which is very useful (usually it comes preinstalled in Kubuntu, that is in a KDE environment, but it works on all Ubuntu based distros. No matter the distro version that you are running (Ubuntu, Xubuntu etc) you can install Dolphin as a separate software package with a 'few' extra dependencies :). It will work fine and make your like easier: \n        sudo apt-get install dolphin\n\nor install it via Synaptic Package Manager where you can specifically look for and install all the other dependencies that Dolphin needs to help you share your files.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Microsoft office 2011- Mac version - in Ubuntu? I have Mac Version of office 2011. Can I install that in Ubuntu 14.04LTS?\n\nA: It is not possible because we don't have any good compatibility layer that supports MAC OS X programs well.  The closest, and only one would be Darling. Sadly, it can only run basic hello world programs. WINE does support Windows programs well, but not MAC OS X programs. So if you have the Windows version.

So\nfind /opt/lampp/htdocs/EspoCRM-2.5.2/data/ -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \\;\n\nshould also work as find call. \n\nA: As others have said, find's -exec needs to be terminated. However I would actually suggest using + instead of \\;. This only works for some commands but using + will build and run a much more efficient command.\nFor example, if you have three files (a, b and c) in a directory and you run find -exec echo {} \\; it will execute:\necho a\necho b\necho c\n\nHowever, if you use find -exec echo {} + it will dynamically select as many arguments as the environment supports (there is a limit) and, like xargs chains them together... So what is actually run is:\necho a b c\n\nAs I said before this will only work if your command supports multiple files at a time. chmod is one of this. You can tell by looking at the man chmod page:\nSYNOPSIS\n       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...\n       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...\n       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...\nThe ellipsis on FILE... means it can take more than one file.\nSo yeah, chaining them all together means we run much fewer instances of chmod which is good because there's quite a large overhead (on small operations like this) for forking out a new command. \nIn short, using + is faster. \n\nA: You need to end your command with \\;\nTry this:\ncd /opt/lampp/htdocs/EspoCRM-2.5.2 && find data -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Install anti virus in Ubuntu14 I installed latest Ubuntu 14 64 bit\nkindly suggest me an anti-virus to install compatible with Ubuntu 14\nplease also explain the steps to install it\n\nA: The predominant antivirus for Linux based systems is called clamav.\nYou install it with\nsudo apt-get install clamav\n\nHowever, that does not set up a graphical interface for it, nor does it enable scheduled or on-demand scanning - you have to scan manually via the command-line.\nTherefore, there are a variety of other tools you can use to extend the functionality of clamav.\nFor starters, you may want to try clamtk which is a graphical frontend:\nsudo apt-get install clamtk\n\n", "Q: Shortcuts on my desktop?

It would open Nautilus with tab 1, then open tab 2, etc. It uses the clipboard to store the tab location, and pastes it in to the location field.\nYou would need to manually set the number of windows and the tabs in each one before each shutdown. But I realized you could use the script in reverse to save the open tabs:\n#Save old clipboard value\noldclip=\"$(xclip -o -sel clip)\"\n\nwmctrl -xF -R nautilus.Nautilus && xdotool key ctrl+l ctrl+c\ntab=$(xclip -o -sel clip)\ntabs[0]=\"\"\n\ni=1\n\nwhile [ \"$tab\" != \"$tabs[0]\"]; do\n    tabs[i]=\"$tab\"\n    wmctrl -xF -R nautilus.Nautilus && xdotool key ctrl+l ctrl+c\n    tab=$(xclip -o -sel clip)\n    i=$[$i + 1]\ndone\n\n#i=1\n\n#while i < $windows; do\n    #open window, open tabs?\n#done\n\n#Restore old clipboard value\necho -n \"$oldclip\" | xclip -i -sel clip\n\nThat's about all I can do at the moment.

Server 1 can run shell without ./ but server 2 requires it. Both have 777 permission. \n\nA: Normally scripts/programs in the current folder are not executed on linux/unix.\nScripts/programs are only executed when the script/program can be found in the $PATH variable.\nSo when the path is not included in the $PATH variable you have to give the path to the script/program to run it. To execute a script/program in the current folder you have to prepend it with ./ which denotes the currect folder.\nPlease check that the $PATH variable on both servers are the same.\nBased on your comment about the $PATH variable I suspect that one of the scripts is in a folder that is found by the $PATH variable whereas the other is in another folder.\nAttention\nIt is a bad idea to include ./ in your $PATH. This way a user can create a malicious command (such as ls) and guide you into the folder where he saves it.

What I'm using\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04\n\n*SSH connection to another Ubuntu 14.04 machine\n\nWhat I'm trying to do\n\n*\n\n*View/Display the content of an image (.png, .jpeg, .bmp...) from the console.\n\nI'm connecting to a VPS with Ubuntu and I need to know if an image file changes after I updated it, so I need to open/display the picture through ssh.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: If you want to use GUI applications with ssh, you need to use the -X or -Y options (use -Y):\n -X      Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host\n         basis in a configuration file.\n\n         X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the\n         ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the\n         user's X authorization database) can access the local X11 display\n         through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then be able\n         to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.\n\n         For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY\n         extension restrictions by default.  Please refer to the ssh -Y\n         option and the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for\n         more information.\n -Y      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not\n         subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.\n\nSo, for example, to use eog to display the remote image at /path/to/file.png, you would do\nssh -Y liarez@remote.host eog /path/to/file.png\n\n", "Q: Canon LBP2900 installation in 14.04 LTS How to install Canon LBP2900 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\nA: Go to the Cannon Asia website (or any other Cannon website) and download the driver CAPT Printer Driver for Linux Version 2.60.

Ubuntu 14.04 does not detect it as a mobile broadband modem. If I put my SIM card into my old modem(E3131) everything works, E3272 is just not detected. I have checked lsusb, and here I can see the system detects it as \n12d1:14fe Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. \nbut I cannot choose it in my Network Connections.\nI tried adding usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x14fe in /etc/modules, but it did not change anything.

I would like to be able to use LTE. :)\n\nA: The same changes is applicable, and needed, in Ubuntu 14.10 as well.\nSo open the Terminal and copy the following:\nsudo gedit /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules\n\nAdd the following lines:\n# Huawei E3272 \nATTR{idVendor}==\"12d1\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"157c\", RUN +=\"usb_modeswitch '%b/%k'\" \n\nSave the file, close all open programs and restart the system. Now reinsert your modem. There will be no message or confirmation, but the connection will appear in your panel as it would if you would insert an ethernet cable.\n\nA: This worked for my E353/E3131 HiLink Modem on Ubuntu 16.04LTS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the modem idvendor and idProduct using lsusb.\n\n*Open the Terminal and run the following:\nsudo gedit /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules\n\nThis will open gedit editor.

If you only want to delete the comment and not the entire line, you should probably use:\nsed 's/<!--.*-->//'\n\nIn my case, I had a minified XML file where the entire content was in a single line and since the previous solution would delete the entire line where the comment was located, it would completely clear out my file.\n\nA: This is good to clean multiline comments (like failed tests) from a xml, least the ones you hand picked and are helpful to the end user:\nperl -i -w -0777pe 's/<!--(.(?<!(HELP|TODO)))*?-->//sg' somefile.xml\nmore about related regex: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1240293/1422630\nIf there is a way to obtain the same result but using xmlstarlet, I would prefer as there may have some exception that regex may not handle, but for now this is what I have to use.\n", "Q: Forbidden You don't have permission to access /phpmyadmin on this server I installed php, mysql, phpmyadmin on my Ubuntu 12.04 localhost in the following steps:\nI try these steps: \nsudo apt-get install apache2\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\nsudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5\nsudo apt-get install php5-cli\nsudo apt-get install php5-cgi\nsudo apt-get install php5-mysql\nsudo apt-get install php5-pgsql\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nthan after i faced phpmyadmin not found error and fixed using the following answer\nHow to solve the phpmyadmin not found issue after upgrading php and apache?\nAfter applying that fix I got another error message:\nForbidden  You don't have permission to access /phpmyadmin on this server.\n\nHow can fix this?\n\nA: It solved : \nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: You need to change the permission with:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/  \nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www \n\n\nA: *\n\n*You should check /etc/apache2 and find the below lines:\n<Directory /usr/share>\n    AllowOverride None\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\n\n*the apache2 config should have this line:\nInclude /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf\n\n\n*Be you you phpadmin config look like this:\nAlias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin\n\n<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin>\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n\n    <IfModule mod_php5.c>\n        AddType application/x-httpd-php .php\n\n        php_flag magic_quotes_gpc Off\n        php_flag track_vars On\n        php_flag register_globals Off\n        php_admin_flag allow_url_fopen Off\n        php_value include_path .\n        php_admin_value upload_tmp_dir /var/lib/phpmyadmin/tmp\n        php_admin_value open_basedir /usr/share/phpmyadmin/:/etc/phpmyadmin/:/var/lib/phpmyadmin/:/usr/share/php/php-gettext/:/usr/share/javascript/\n   </IfModule>\n</Directory>\n\n<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin/setup>\n    <IfModule mod_authn_file.c>\n        AuthType Basic\n        AuthName \"phpMyAdmin Setup\"\n        AuthUserFile /etc/phpmyadmin/htpasswd.setup\n    </IfModule>\n    Require valid-user\n</Directory>\n\n<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries>\n    Order Deny,Allow\n    Deny from All\n</Directory>\n\n<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin/setup/lib>\n    Order Deny,Allow\n    Deny from All\n</Directory>\n\n\nA: The solution for me, was to uncomment the following lines:\n<Directory /usr/share>\nAllowOverride None\nRequire all granted\n</Directory>\n\nin /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.\n\nA: I faced the issue when I installed PHPMyAdmin in Ubuntu OS 16.04.

I have two files containing billions of DNA sequence names, the second is a proper subset of the first:\nfor example,\n1°:john mike anna paul laura .... \n\n2°:john mike paul ...\n\nall the names occupy a single row.\nMy question is, how can I get the names contained in the first file that are not in the second one?\nthank u all!\n\nA: If they're sorted and separated by newlines, you could use comm show you the lines that are unique to file1:\ncomm -23 file1 file2\n\nA demonstration:\n$ comm -23 <(echo -e 'john\\nmike\\nanna\\npaul\\nlaura'|sort) <(echo -e 'john\\nmike\\npaul'|sort)\nanna\nlaura\n\nOr you could diff to do much the same thing (the grep is looking for line deletions):\ndiff sorted-file-1 sorted-file-2 | grep -oP '(?<=< ).+'\n\nIf you need to avoid sorting or you're dealing with serious numbers, I'd turn to a proper language to do dictionary-based lookups. Simple python example:\nfile2 = {}\nwith open(\"file2\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n        file2[line] = 0\n\nwith open(\"file1\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n        if not line in file2:\n            print line\n\nAnything bigger than that and you might want to look at an actual database and some simple SQL. They're geared for big data.\n\nA: This is very simple to do but your life will be much easier if you have one name per line instead of a space separated list. There are many excellent utilities for manipulating text files in Linux, it is one of the things that all *nixes excel at, but most expect one item per line. So, most of my solutions will start with modifying the files accordingly.\nChange your files to have one name per line:\nsed 's/ /\\n/g' file > newfile\n\nor, to modify the original file\nsed -i 's/ /\\n/g' file\n\nOnce you've done that, any of these will give you what you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*grep\n$ grep -vFwf file2 file1\nanna\nlaura\n\n\n*comm or diff\n$ comm -23 <(sort file1) <(sort file2)\nanna\nlaura\n\n\n$ diff file1 file2 | grep -Po '<\\s+\\K.*'\nanna\nlaura\n\n\n*awk\n$ awk '(NR==FNR){a[$1]++; next}!($1 in a){print}' file2 file1 \nlaura\nanna\n\n\n*Perl\n$ perl -lne 'BEGIN{open(A,\"file2\"); while(<A>){chomp; $k{$_}++}} print unless $k{$_}' file2 file1\nlaura\nanna\n\nor\n$ perl -lne '$k{$_}++; END{map{print unless $k{$_}>1}keys(%k)}' file2 file1\nlaura\nanna\n\n\nIf you really don't want to change the format of your file (but really, you should), you can do something like\nawk '{for (i=1;i<=NF;i++){a[$i]++}}END{for(n in a){if(a[n]<2){print n}}}' file2 file1\n\nor\nperl -lane '$k{$_}++ for @F; END{map{print if $k{$_}<2} keys(%k)}' file1 file2\n\n\nA: And the python option: regardless if all words are in one line or on separate lines:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\n\nf1 = sys.argv[1]; f2 = sys.argv[2]\n\ndef read(f):\n    with open(f) as content:\n        return content.read().split()\n\nfor item in [w for w in read(f1) if not w in read(f2)]:\n    print(item)\n\nCopy the script into an empty file, save it as showdiff.py make it executable and run it by the command:\n/path/to/showdiff.py file1 file2\n\nanna\nlaura\n\nNote\nNot the question, but too much connected to leave out:\nIf you need to list the differences mutually, (not only words in file1 that do not appear in file2, but also words in file2 that do not appear in file1), The script below should be used:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\n\nf1 = sys.argv[1]; f2 = sys.argv[2]\n\ndef read(f):\n    with open(f) as content:\n        return content.read().split()\n\nwds1 = read(f1); wds2 = read(f2); allwords = wds1+wds2\nfor item in [w for w in allwords if (w in wds1, w in wds2).count(False) == 1]:\n    print(item)\n\n\nA: If you go the python option as suggested by Jacob Vlijm, it is worth using the 'set' (for further info, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset).  Basically, once you have created the two sets, you can achieve set math (union, intersection, difference,...)\nIn this case, set difference is exactly what you require: a new set with all elements that are in one set and not in the other.\nThe code from Jacob would then be:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\n\nf1 = sys.argv[1]; f2 = sys.argv[2]\n\ndef read_set(f):\n    with open(f) as content:\n        return set(content.read().split())\n\nfor item in read_set(f1) - read_set(f2)]:\n    print(item)\n\nOf course, for billions of records, it will take a while...\n`\n", "Q: running a tar command eats all resources I am running a Rails application on my ubuntu 12.04 server.

In nemo, if I want to change the icon of a file or folder, I can just go to properties, click on the icon, and choose a new icon.  However, nemo will use the same icon file no matter what the size of the icon is, whether you use list view, icons view, compact, etc.  \nHow do I change the icon on a file or folder and make it so that nemo will use the proper sized icon depending on the current view (ie 16x16 png for list view, scalable svg for icons view, etc.)?\n\nA: It turns out that the question I mentioned in the comments regarding nautilus does work for nemo.  However, if you have already set the folder via this method, you need to undo that information.  If you're trying to change the icon for a_folder from /file_location/icon.svg to the set of icons all named a_folder_icon, for example, you can figure out the current icon info with the command\ngvfs-info a_folder\nThis will output a bunch of data about this location, there will be a line with\nmetadata::custom-icon: file:///file_location/icon.svg\nshowing the icon metadata.  By entering the command\ngvfs-set-attribute -t unset a_folder metadata::custom-icon /file_location/icon.svg\nyou can remove this metadata, and gvfs-info a_folder should no longer list the icon you set.  Now you can set the icon name with\ngvfs-set-attribute a_folder metadata::custom-icon-name a_folder_icon\nHowever, this does not seem to change the icon in the nemo sidebar, and it might be impossible to do so.\n", "Q: Fixing resolv.conf from Comcast Meddling So I'm trying to get Ruby on Rails set-up on my development machine (with a fresh install of ubuntu 14.04).\nEverything is going well until I get this lovely message from the terminal:\n$ gem install rails\nERROR:  While executing gem ...

Either you know which partition to rescue, i.e. specify /dev/sdaX as if argument of dd or make and image of the whole device (better idea), mount it under a loop device, e.g. findout next free loop device with losetup -f, use it with losetup /dev/loopY /path/to/image.img and make the kernel recognize the partitions with kpartx /dev/loopYp? where ? should be the number of the partition you wanted to rescue the way described in you question.\nDepending on how severely broken the disk it, i.e. whether further reads might damage it more, and how much space you have on any storage device, make an image of the original or of the copy (the result would be the copy of a copy, but this might prevent damage to the original by reading).\nSpeed up things: When you use the copy of /dev/sdb on /dev/sda3 (only use it if you have to), you are copying a lot of useless data if /dev/sdb is only 160 GB (the difference between the end of /dev/sdb and the end of /dev/sda3). If you want to skip that, tell dd to only copy the length of /dev/sdb with bs and count argument (man dd is mandatory reading in this case).\nMaybe there's a way to tell the kernel with some tweaks that /dev/sda3/ contains a partition table, but I'd consider this rather tricky and experimental.\n\nA: Making an image is a good idea. Having holes in your data is to be expected. \nBut once you have an image, you can fall back to it.\n\n\n*\n\n*fsck, if it fails, try again.\n\n*Copy partitions to partions, disks to disks.\n\n\n*\n\n*do not copy sdb to sda3 this is \"disk to partition\", not normal.\n\n\n*If you do copy to a larger area, and fsck is OK, this may be as good as it gets, but you can still mine hex and text from the image. (maybe jpegs even).\n\n*If it working and all good, and you have moved to a larger device, you can increase partition sizes and \"grow the filesystem to fill the partition\".\n", "Q: How to enable/disable proxy I am facing some issues with loading some specific web pages, the web pages does not load at all.

Then I sftp'd in, cd'd to tmp, and ran ls -l:\ndrwxrwxr-x    2 ek       ek           4096 Sep 19 19:39 .\ndrwxr-xr-x   30 ek       ek           4096 Sep 19 19:39 ..\n-rw-rw-r--    1 ek       ek              0 Sep 19 19:39 foo\n\nYou'll notice that all entries show a date and time. That's not part of their name, it's just the time they're marked as having last been modified.\nThe name is to the right of that, separated by a space. Thus there are three entries:\n\n\n*\n\n*foo, the file I created.\n\n*.., which represents the parent directory (i.e., the folder one up):\nsftp> pwd\nRemote working directory: /home/ek/tmp\nsftp> cd ..\nsftp> pwd\nRemote working directory: /home/ek\n\n(Except when you're in /. There's nothing above / in the directory tree. Then--and only then--.. represents the same directory as ..)\n\n*., which represents the current directory (i.e., the directory you're in now).\nsftp> cd tmp\nsftp> pwd\nRemote working directory: /home/ek/tmp\nsftp> cd .\nsftp> pwd\nRemote working directory: /home/ek/tmp\n\nls only shows the . and .. entries when the -a flag is supplied (or when you explicitly give their names, or a pattern that matches them, after ls on the command line). This is true both of the ls command in sftp and the ls command issued on a full login session with a regular shell prompt.\n\nA: You are misinterpreting the output of ls. The actual directory name is .. and it is a special directory used to navigate through the file-system (like when you type cd .. to go one level up). Every sub-directory has one. Sep 19 18:50 is just the creation date of the directory.\n\nA: I think it's due to the spaces try this:\nsudo rm -rf \"/home/user/Downloads/manual/Sep 19 18:50\"\n\n\nA: I believe that's an empty folder. the .. part actually means that you can go \" up a step\" in the file tree if you type cd .. \n\nA: root@dsadwsd:/home/user/Downloads/manual# ls -al\ntotal 32\ndrwxrwxr-x 3 keelan keelan  4096 Sep 19 18:50\ndrwxrwxr-x 3 keelan keelan 12288 Sep 20 07:56 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 keelan keelan 16384 Sep 19 23:11 ..\n\nWhen i highlighted:\ndrwxrwxr-x 3 keelan keelan  4096 Sep 19 18:50\n\nThere was a space at the end. So i did:\nroot@dsadwsd:/home/user/Downloads/manual# rm -rf \" \"\n\nThis removed the folder. Strange how the folder name wouldn't just be blank (space) but instead took the folder creation date.\nI can now replicate this by creating a new folder via sftp with a space as the name, it changes the folder name to the creation date.\nThanks for the help!\n", "Q: How do I check if installed VLC is 64 bit or 32 bit?

The easiest way to get this kernel is to install the corresponding hardware enablement stack:\nhttp://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/canonical_kernel_team/trusty/main/base/linux-generic-lts-utopic\nWhen I add the PPA and install the package after installation, it works out fine. However, when I add linux-generic-lts-utopic to the pkgsel/include line in my preseed, I get a kernel panic on first boot into the installed system (happens in Parallels and on the actual hardware). It turns out that I have to use the GRUB menu to first boot the default 3.13 kernel, and then run:\nsudo update-initramfs -c -k 3.16.0-17-generic\nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter doing this, it can boot 3.16 just fine.\nThis seems super janky. Is this a regression in the hardware enablement stack, or a problem with the installer, or something missing from preseed?\nThanks.\n\nA: For a generalized version of the hack, do:\nupdate-initramfs -c -k $(ls /lib/modules -1 | tail -1)\nupdate-grub\n\nThis can be done directly from the late_command, or via a script that the late command invokes.\n\nA: Have you tried using the lts-utopic d-i images linked from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot/trusty/ rather than trying to hack it up in a preseed from a d-i booting with 3.13?\n", "Q: 503 too many open connections error - did I muck something up?

Does Ubuntu come with an equivalent to the Disk Management tool in Windows? How do I access it?\n\nA: You can use the Disks utility which is installed by default.\nJust search for \"Disks\" in the dash or run gnome-disks from terminal.\n\nIt does look a bit different than Windows Disk Management, but includes a variety of features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating new partition tables\n\n*Creating and restoring disk images (this is what dd does, just nicer and with a progress bar)\n\n*Benchmarking disks or partitions\n\n*Reading SMART data (for disks and data connections that support it)\n\n*Apply Standby Timeout Settings and Enable Write Cache  (through Drive Settings… menu option)\n\n*Manually putting drives into standby mode or shutting them down\n\n*Format partitions\n\n*Setting partition flags and attributes\n\n*Changing partition labels\n\n*Handling LUKS encrypted disks\n\n\n…and probably a lot more. If you're just looking for a straight forward partition manager you may want to have a look at GParted.\nWhat you may not find in any graphical tool to my knowledge is how to create and manage software RAID arrays. You should have a look at btrfs, ZFS (on Linux) and mdadm for this functionality.\n\n\nA: The partitions manager in Ubuntu would be the Disks utility.\nIn a terminal:\ngnome-disks\n\nIn the launcher, search for Disks.\n\nA: GParted is also a very good utility for changing partitioning of disks round!

I disabled it and saved the setting to xconf but every time the non existent display with low resolution is used after reboot. and I have to manually change the settings again. \nScreenshot -\n\nxrandr -q gives\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 8192 x 8192\nVGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDVI-I-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nTV-0 connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n   1024x768       60.0 +\n   800x600        60.0  \n   720x480        60.0  \n   640x480        60.0  \n   640x400        60.0  \n   512x384        60.0  \nDVI-I-1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 477mm x 268mm\n   1920x1080      60.0*+   50.0  \n   1680x1050      60.0  \n   1600x1200      60.0  \n   1440x900       59.9  \n   1280x1024      60.0  \n   1280x960       60.0  \n   1280x800       59.8  \n   1280x720       60.0     50.0  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   720x576        50.0  \n   720x480        59.9  \n   640x480        59.9  \n\nxorg.conf reads as \n# nvidia-settings: X configuration file generated by nvidia-settings\n# nvidia-settings:  version 331.20  (buildd@roseapple)  Mon Feb  3 15:07:22 UTC 2014\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Samsung SyncMaster\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 60.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce 8400 GS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DVI-I-1: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    Option         \"SLI\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"MultiGPU\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"BaseMosaic\" \"off\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nI remember disabling this 2nd screen using xorg.conf in my last mint install.

My Windows Partition works perfectly fine, the GRUB menu works perfectly fine, and I've installed any updates for Ubuntu that were present after install. However I cannot get Ubuntu to display in my native resolution of 1920 x 1080. I am only given two options for resolution in the settings, 800 x 600 and 1024 x 768. My graphics card is a nVidia Geforce 750Ti that is connected to my monitor via HDMI.\nI've Googled this problem extensively and ultimately decided to try and update my graphics card driver. I downloaded the correct driver from nVidia's website and followed their install instructions. However I cannot get the driver to install. When I attempt to install the graphics driver I get an error message saying I'm running an X server.\nI Googled how to disable the X server and I've tried numerous commands from killall x to sudo service lightdm stop. Neither of this worked. I either receive a message stating that no instance of X is running, or in the case with stopping lightdm, my entire screen goes black and I'm unable to do anything until I reboot my computer.\nAny advice on what to do?\n\nA: The proprietary Nvidia drivers included in 14.04 do not support the newer GeForce 750/750Ti.\nSolution 1 (the easier one): PPA\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Add the repository with the driver version that supports the 750Ti: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\n*Update your software lists and software:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y\n\n*Install one of the Nvidia drivers (e.g. -343)\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-343\n\n*Restart\n\n\nThis will survive a kernel update.\n\nSolution 2: Manual installation\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to console (I assume you simply opened gnome-terminal): \nctrl+alt+F1 (back to desktop with F7)\n\n*Login with your user account.\n\n*Stop lightdm: \nsudo service lightdm stop\n\n*Install the Nvidia driver: \nsudo sh /path/to/installer.sh\n\n*Restart lightdm: \nsudo service lightdm start\nYou may have to repeat these steps after a kernel update!\n\nTo change your screen resolution to FHD, check display settings, or otherwise the Nvidia X server settings tool.\n", "Q: What is a desktop environment, session and shell? This is how all happened. I was trying to search good screen recorder and found on some website that recordMyDesktop will work well under GNOME *Shell. So I tried searching in google \"how to find whether I'm using gnome shell\". The first link directed me to official gnome wesite there it showed a message as below.\n So I thought it is something to do with desktop environment and continue browsing as below.\nIn this question I tried first answer to find my desktop environment, but the command DESKTOP_SESSION gave me \"command not found\". So I tried 5th answer by Nadiw. The command and output are as below.\nls /usr/bin/*session\n/usr/bin/ck-launch-session  /usr/bin/gnome-session\n\nSo it is confirmed I'm using GNOME but it is not showing as desktop environment instead its showing \"session\", by which I got confused.\nHence I tried third answer by Luis Alvarado from this post. The command and output are as below\necho $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP\nUnity\n\nNow I found this totally irrelevant. My questions are\n\n\n*\n\n*If the desktop environment is Unity how can it use a session of GNOME and GNOME shell.\n\n*How GNOME shell is different from bourne shell, t shell and others\n\n*Or if one of the outputs I'm getting is wrong? Then how to find which DE i'm using? And which is the default DE for Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n*On which of these factors I should depend while downloading a software? Whether it is Desktop Environment or session or shell? \n\nA: DESKTOP_SESSION is not a command, it's a variable. You can do echo $DESKTOP_SESSION to see what the value is, just like with XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP:\n$ echo $DESKTOP_SESSION \ngnome\n$ echo $XDG_DESKTOP_SESSION\n\n$ echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP\nGNOME\n\n(I'm using GNOME Shell. Yes, I did not get any output for XDG_DESKTOP_SESSION. This is a known bug.)\nThis output is not irrelevant:\n$ echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP\nUnity\n\nIt is the most relevant bit of information you have, that you are running the Unity shell.\n\n\n*\n\n*To install Gnome Shell:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\nSee the third of the reference links for screenshots for selecting Gnome Shell.\n\n*The interface, the part that you interact with, is called a shell. The Bourne shell and other classic shells are command line shells. Gnome Shell, Unity, etc. are graphical shells.\n\n*The default Desktop Environment for Ubuntu is GNOME 3, with the Unity shell and other modifications. Because the base is GNOME, you'll see some output which is true for GNOME Shell as well, for the various tests.\n\n*Usually, none. The answer to this is very complicated and application-dependent. Have a look at the fifth linked question.\n\n\nAs for the browser error, if it persists after you start using Gnome Shell, see the FAQ.\nAlso see:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the relationship between Unity, Gnome, Gnome 3, Compiz, Metacity, and LightDM?  \n\n*What kinds of desktop environments and shells are available?\n\n*How do I install and use the latest version of GNOME?\n\n*What is the default desktop environment for Ubuntu 13.10?\n\n*When installing packages (particularly those with graphical UIs) how do you determine which is fitting for your distribution?\n\nA: To answer your question number 2, a shell is command interpret. You communicate with OS through shell. In GNOME and Unity  you do it graphically, by clicking on stuff,  and in Bourne shell - by text commands entered into terminal\n", "Q: There is no SPICE protocol in vinagre for Ubuntu There is SPICE in vinagre for Fedora, but in the same version of vinagre in Ubuntu there is no SPICE. Why? \n\nA: SPICE wasn't available in Vinagre because it used to be compiled without support for it. Reading the Debian bug report it appears that this choice was related to the fact that libspice-client-gtk is only available on i386 and amd64, and not on other architectures.\nHowever, since version 3.12, Vinagre is now built with the right build-dependencies and hence has SPICE support.

When I start up my computer, it says: \"scanning for btrfs filesystems\".\nI do need the btrfs-tools, but my btrfs filesystems are on a removable disk which is disconnected at start-up.\nScanning for btrfs filesystems adds a considerable delay to system start-up and seems unnecessary. How can I avoid it?\nI have installed:\nubuntu 14.04 LTS\nBtrfs v3.12\n\nA: When you install btrfs-tools, some hooks come with this to \"install\" btrfs support in your initramfs that come in boot to your system.\nthe files are\n/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/btrfs\n/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/btrfs\n\n(you can check with dpkg -L btrfs-tools) one alternative can be that after you install btrfs-tools, delete these files and after this rebuild your initramfs from /boot with\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nand with this your boot process will avoid to preload the btrfs module and try to detect any module on boot. You will need to do this any time that btrfs-tools get installed/updated in your system. And you are going to need to do a modprobe btrfs just in case, before plug-in your external disks formated with btrfs.\n\nA: I tried searching for «btrfs» in /boot, and when I removed all the lines containing «btrfs» from config files there, no such message appears again.\nThis may appear some sort of a rough workaround, though.\n", "Q: What is the HUD-service responsible for? I just disabled the hud-service because it was taking up 2.8 GiB of my computers RAM.\n\nI understand that it is part of the unity ecosystem because others are posting solutions along the lines of installing xubuntu etc. However, I like running stock-ubuntu as this tends to make asking for help and diagnosing issues easier (just my opinion).\nQuestion\nCould someone explain to me what this service is responsible for, and thus what I am sacrificing by disabling this service?\nPossibly Related Info\nI use synapse for searching/starting applications, and always have the unity-side launcher/dashboard hidden and never use it. I switch between applications using the compiz ring-switcher which is set to display everything from all workspaces, and the desktop \"wall\" combined with expo.\n\nA: You can just remove the hud package: sudo apt-get purge hud. No need to mess with CCSM or the actual hud-service executable (your changes would be overwritten during upgrades).\n\nA: The HUD is related to the Unity Launcher. For example it analyzes the files you are using and offers them when you press Super.\nOn my system (Ubuntu 15.10) the hud-service started using 100% of one CPU.\nI solved this by installing Compiz Config Settings Manager (ccsm) and disabled all effects and set \"Enable Low Graphics Mode\" in \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\":\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nccsm\n\n\nA: The HUD or Head-Up Display was introduced in release 12.04. It is still being developped and perfected and meant to ultimately replace menus in Unity.  \nThis wiki should definitely help you understand some of the intent and portent of HUD (hud-service) as an integral part of the unity architecture. It is meant to be and functions as an \"intent-driven interface\" meant to facilitate the management of the desktop's applications' menu interface, the GUI end of it being the visible std-out (display).  \nTo most users hud-service remains obscure and a \"background thing\". In fact its central promise is that it will help tap users' actions' predictability in navigating the GUI.  \nIf you turn that service off you will arguably downgrade the efficiency of your GUI management in terms of responsiveness and RAM usage. Remember that Unity is a rather chunky bit of software and it puts a strain on any system, however big it happens to be.\nHTH\n\nA: In general, hud should allow you to specify what you are doing by typing in the dash instead of using the menus of a program, as shown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_WW-DHqR3c \nAt least in Ubuntu 16.10, some things of this (e.g. going to firefox bookmarks) does not work anymore (at least out of the box). If you aren't using hud, it is safe to remove it. This does not affect the dash usage for finding other things like the last program that you used, as this information is provided by zeitgeist (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Zeitgeist).\n", "Q: Can't get permission for deleting a file - not even as root!

The main problem was that the keyboard got unified first which messed it up for some reason. If I removed everything and unified the mouse first and then the keyboard, everything worked. The reason it didn't work at first when I tried this was because the keyboard didn't get properly removed.\nSolution:\n1: Install Solaar (for easy management).\n2: Remove all unified devices (connect other keyboard and mouse with cable to control from here).\n3: Now turn off both mouse and keyboard and unplug the unifier from the machine.\n4: Insert the unifier again and choose to unify new device via Solaar.\n5: Turn on the mouse.\n6: When the mouse is unified properly, turn on the keyboard.\nThe problem with the lagging was because of two things. The first cause seems to have been that I had the two devices somehow unified three times in Solaar. Fixing this and restarting seems to have solved most of the lagg, but not all. The rest of the lagging issue was resolved by using another USB-plug in the machine. Apparently the unifier draws a lot of power which the front USB-plugs in my Intel NUC couldn't seem to handle.\nHope this solves it for others as well :-)\n", "Q: Is there any virtual MIDI loopback solution for Ubuntu/Linux? I'm not sure how many of you play music, but in Windows there are several virtual MIDI loopback software to route MIDI from one program to another. For example, loopMIDI and midiyoke, and LoopBe1. In Mac, I think it is known as IAC drivers. \nIs there any virtual MIDI loopback solution for Ubuntu/Linux?\nThese are my available devices as shown by a Java applet,\nAvailable MIDI Devices:\n----------Input----------\n[0] \"Real Time Sequencer\"\n----------Output----------\n[0] \"Gervill\"\n[1] \"Real Time Sequencer\"\n\n\nA: In Linux, applications can create the same kind of MIDI port as drivers, so a MIDI loopback driver is typically not necessary.\nIf you want to use one anyway, you can use the \"Midi Through\" port(s) created by the snd-seq-dummy driver, which is loaded automatically.\n\nA: I believe that the program which you are looking for is Jack, which cann be used to route midi data from one program to another.\nJack can be fairly complicated to setup, and a good tutorial can be found at https://libremusicproduction.com/articles/demystifying-jack-%E2%80%93-beginners-guide-getting-started-jack\nThe basics would be to install jack, which can be most easily accomplished by installing one of the jack management tools to start Jack, and to create routes.\nsudo apt install qjackctl\nwill do this for you.\n", "Q: Samba server doesn't notice changed password I've tied samba to unix passwords via\nsecurity = user\n\nand\nunix password sync = yes\n\nPreviously this has worked very well.

I changed my linux user password the first time since the upgrade now, with the result that samba won't recognize the changed password - it still expects the user's old one.\nI have restarted the smbd service, but no change. What is going on here?\n\nA: I had the same issue after upgrading from Debian Squeeze to Wheezy. Other posts I saw suggested installing the libpam-smbpass package.\nAfter I installed libpam-smbpass, changes to a user's system password were immediately reflected by Samba.

But the instructions that are given doesn't wield the desired results.\nI want only the subtitle to move under the video when this is possible.\nWhat I get is that the entire picture gets padded with new pixels. \nWhen there is enough space above, depending on the video's aspect ratio, the picture is moved upwards above the subtitles, which are not moved. \nBut when there is not enough space above, the picture gets \"squeezed\" to make room for the newly positioned subtitles. I do not want the image to be altered in this way\nIf initially the subtitles look like so:\n\nAfter changing settings I do not want them to look like so:\n\nExample: follow the instructions up to the third step, type in 222 pixels, and follow the rest of the instructions. Now you should be able to see that this is not desirable in any way. I am surprised no one complained.\nQuestion: how do I move the subtitle under the video without it distorting the image in any way?\n\nA: Apparently you can't do it in VLC as it needs to draw on the canvas, hence the workaround that allows you to pad the video. As someone noted on the VLC forums this is cumbersome because you need to set it up each time the resolution changes.\n\nA: The height of the video is shrunk by the same factor as the width. I do not see any distortion, it is just a scaling which conserves the aspect ratio of the video. But it would be desirable that the video area is not shrunk. This seems to be impossible with vlc. After the \"padding\", you can adjust the area of the video by shiftig the window borders. That way, you can obtain approximately the desired result.\n\nA: I think the answer under the other question provides a solution in VLC but only suitable to certain aspect ratios.\nDepending on the aspect ratio, a video image may have or may not have a black space under the video.\nConsidering the linked answer:\n\n*\n\n*when the picture has a black space below it, it also has a black space above it, and so the picture is not squeezed, but moved upwards, while the above space is diminished (notice that in the images below).\n\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nI am using VLC 2.2 and to get this effect I made some settings that are somehow different from the ones in the other answer:\n\n\n\n*when the aspect ratio is such that it does not leave space under and below the image you cannot add subtitles outside the image without shrinking it somehow (as you say: \"the picture gets \"squeezed\" to make room for the newly positioned subtitles\"). But in such a case it doesn't make much sense to display the subtitles under the picture.\n\nOnly that with those settings VLC keeps doing that even when that is not the most preferable option.\nWhen I need subtitles under picture (that is: as low as possible without squeezing the image) I find it much easier just to open the video in a different player like bomy player, which can easily activate and deactivate the needed setting.\nJust right-click on the image:\n\n\nWhen playing a video at an aspect ratio that fills the entire screen, bomi (formerly CMPlayer) displays the subs on the picture with or without the 'letterbox' option.\n\nTrying to use SMPlayer for the same purpose:\nCannot make it work, although I have the impression that putting subs as low as possible was doable in smplayer...\nThe solution found here (adding vf=expand=0:-50:0:0 in ~/.mplayer/config) gives a result very similar to the VLC settings in the other answer.\n", "Q: No sound on 14.04 As the title, I'm getting no sound on Ubuntu 14.04; sound are correctly reproduced on Windows.\nI've tried many solutions, but the problem seems to be that pulseaudio doesn't recognize my sound card.\nMaybe this is due to some changes that I've done in bootup services, even if I don't think I changed something related to audio devices.\nThis is the services current running\n$>sudo service --status-all\n [ + ]  acpid\n [ - ]  anacron\n [ - ]  apache2\n [ + ]  apparmor\n [ ? ]  apport\n [ + ]  atd\n [ + ]  avahi-daemon\n [ ? ]  binfmt-support\n [ + ]  bluetooth\n [ - ]  brltty\n [ + ]  bumblebeed\n [ ? ]  console-setup\n [ + ]  cron\n [ ? ]  cryptdisks\n [ ? ]  cryptdisks-early\n [ + ]  cups\n [ + ]  cups-browsed\n [ - ]  dbus\n [ + ]  ddclient\n [ + ]  dictd\n [ ? ]  dns-clean\n [ + ]  ebtables\n [ - ]  fancontrol\n [ + ]  friendly-recovery\n [ - ]  grub-common\n [ - ]  hddtemp\n [ ? ]  irqbalance\n [ + ]  kerneloops\n [ ? ]  killprocs\n [ ? ]  kmod\n [ + ]  libvirt-bin\n [ ? ]  lightdm\n [ - ]  lm-sensors\n [ ? ]  mysql\n [ ? ]  networking\n [ + ]  nmbd\n [ + ]  ntop\n [ ? ]  ondemand\n [ - ]  postgresql\n [ ? ]  pppd-dns\n [ - ]  procps\n [ - ]  pulseaudio\n [ ? ]  qemu-system-x86\n [ ? ]  rc.local\n [ + ]  resolvconf\n [ - ]  rsync\n [ + ]  rsyslog\n [ ? ]  runhwactivator\n [ + ]  samba\n [ - ]  samba-ad-dc\n [ + ]  saned\n [ ? ]  screen-cleanup\n [ ? ]  sendsigs\n [ - ]  smartmontools\n [ + ]  smbd\n [ ? ]  speech-dispatcher\n [ - ]  sudo\n [ ? ]  tlp\n [ - ]  tomcat7\n [ + ]  udev\n [ ? ]  umountfs\n [ ? ]  umountnfs.sh\n [ ? ]  umountroot\n [ - ]  unattended-upgrades\n [ - ]  urandom\n [ ? ]  vboxautostart-service\n [ + ]  vboxballoonctrl-service\n [ + ]  vboxdrv\n [ + ]  vboxweb-service\n [ + ]  winbind\n [ - ]  x11-common\n\nI noticed that many of the services flagged as [ - ] actually are active; so, I don't know if this output is true.

You can use gparted for that. Select your partition, reduce its size by the amount you want the new partition to have. Then you have that removed space as free unused space. Create the new partition from it and install Windows there. I had done this a lot of times without any issue, but anyway I would recommend you to backup your disk first. \nIf you don't want to do this, you can remove everything and create all from scratch.

How?\n\nA: Yes it is.   First you are going to want to use GParted to shrink the Ubuntu Partition and make the Windows partition bigger. GPARTED DOES WARN YOU THAT THERE IS A CHANCE OF DATA LOSS IF DONE INCORRECTLY.\nFirst install UNetBootin on your ubuntu distro.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gezakovacs/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nThen download GParted Live ISO. (Direct Link)\nhttp://downloads.sourceforge.net/gparted/gparted-live-0.19.1-4-i486.iso\n\nNow open UNetBootin.\nSelect DiskImage\nBrowse to where you put the disc image (.Iso)\nNow select your USB\nand click install  FILES WILL BE DELETED ON USB SO MAKE A BACK UP\nNow once done boot up PC and go to boot manager and select USB (So just boot from usb)\nthen select LIVE or somthing like that.\nNow it should boot up.\nAll you need to do now is take the Ubuntu Partition, click on shrink and shrink it down how u want. Then select the Windows Partition and you will be able to make it bigger!\nAnd now your all done, when you get into ubuntu agian go ahead and format your usb and put all of your files you had before.\nGoodLuck!\n\nA: Sure, it is certainly possible using GParted (Ubuntu) and Disk Management (Windows).\nHowever, pay attention! If you want to reduce a Windows partition, the best thing is to do this from Windows.\nPreconditions\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of all important stuffs!!\n\n*Take a look at your partitions and how you want to\nresize them. Simply put, if you have 3 close partitions, namely | A\n| B | C |, and you want to reduce A and increase B, you have to put\nall the A clusters at the beginning; in this way, you're sure that\nthe increase process doesn't overwrite important stuffs.  If instead\nyou want to reduce C and extend B, you have to put all the C\nclusters at the end of the partition.  \n\n*So, if you want to reduce an Ubuntu partition, the best way to proceed is to execute first the steps of Ubuntu side and then the ones of Windows side. On the other hand, if you want to reduce a Windows partition, the best thing to do is to execute first Windows side and then Ubuntu side\nWindows side\nReducing a partition\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a complete defrag of the partition using some\nexternal tool. The best way to do this is before Windows is loaded;\nultradefrag is the best choice IMHO. The goal is to move the most\nclusters at the beginning (or at the end, depends on your actual situation) of the partition.\n\n*Open the built-in utility Disk Management (Control Panel>System and Security>Administrative Tools>Computer Management> Disk Management), right click\non your partition and select \"Shrink volume\". In the Shrink dialog, you will want to enter the amount you want to shrink by, not the new size. Then click \"Shrink\". \n\n*At the end of the process you can see a gray area (called like \"Raw partition\") in the image on the right.\n\n\nExtending a partition\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Management and take a look at the image on the right. If you have a \"Raw partition\" close (on the left or on the right) to the one you want to extend, you can continue. \n\n*Right click on your partition and select \"Extend volume\". On the screen, you can specify the amount that you want to increase the partition by. Then click next and wait.\n\n\nUbuntu side\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to a LiveCD or LiveUSB drive in \"Try me\" mode. \n\n*Launch GParted; then right click on your partition, click resize and follow the\ninstructions. Click apply.\n\n*Reboot, taking out the USB stick or CD when it tells you to.\n\n", "Q: Gnome do installation and disk space usage I installed Gnome-Do on Xubuntu and it said 52 MB of disk space will be used up while installation.

For example:\n$ history 4\n 2000  type history\n 2001  help\n 2002  help history\n 2003  history 4\n$\n\nSo we can make an alias in your .bashrc:\nalias h=\"history 100\"\n\nFrom help history:\nhistory: history [-c] [-d offset] [n] or history -anrw [filename] or history -ps arg [arg...]\n    Display or manipulate the history list.\n\n    Display the history list with line numbers, prefixing each modified\n    entry with a `*'.

It will restrict history file to  store 100 lines and HISTFILE which stores your cureent session command in memory   to 100 lines.\nWhen the shell starts up, the history is initialized from the file named by the HISTFILE variable (default ~/.bash_history). The file named by the value of HISTFILE is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than the number of lines specified by the value of the HISTFILESIZE variable.\nYou can add HISTFILESIZE=100  and HISTSIZE=100 in your ~/.bashrc file .

Juicy J-0KSOMA3QBU0.mp4.part\n\nIt is showing an error:\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nHow to fix it?\n\nA: Tab Completion\nIf you only have one file in /usr/local/bin whose name starts with Katy, you can simply type\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/Katy\n\nwithout pressing Enter yet. Then press Tab to complete the command to:\nsudo rm Katy\\ Perry\\ -\\ Dark\\ Horse\\ \\(Official\\)\\ ft.\\ Juicy\\ J-0KSOMA3QBU0.mp4.part\n\n(And then press Enter to run it.)\nThis quotes each character individually (as in AliNa's answer), and does so automatically so you don't miss anything.\nIn practice, a large amount of quoting we do on the command line is actually achieved automatically with tab completion.\nNote also that tab completion is not limited to situations where something would have to be quoted. For example, a UUID like 8d44cd38-2158-42f4-9af1-94cd3ccbb9a8 doesn't need to be quoted but if it's the only possibility starting with 8 (or with some longer initial proper subsequence), tab completion could be very handy for composing a command containing it.\nYou can also manually quote, in which case you'll want to know about other ways of quoting than \\, for cases like this one where many characters have to be quoted and mistakes are easy to make.\nManual Quoting with '\nIf you want an expression to appear literally, and the expression doesn't contain a single quote characater ('), a good habit to get into is to quote it using single quotes.\nsudo rm '/usr/local/bin/Katy Perry - Dark Horse (Official) ft. Juicy J-0KSOMA3QBU0.mp4.part'\nYou can quote all of an argument, or just part of it. For example, this works too:\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/'Katy Perry - Dark Horse (Official) ft. Juicy J-0KSOMA3QBU0.mp4.part'\nOr even:\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/Katy' Perry - Dark Horse (Official) ft. Juicy 'J-0KSOMA3QBU0.mp4.part'\n(I've italicized the portions of the above commands that are quoted, so the effects of ' can be seen.)\nWhen quoting with ', only ' is treated specially. It is always matched as a closing quote mark.\nIn contrast, quoting with double quotes, as is widely recommended (even when unnecessary), will usually work but operates in accordance with quite complex rules.\nManual Quoting with \"\nThere are three common cases where quoting with \" is used in preference over '.\n\n\n*\n\n*For some reason, many people stylistically prefer \". This is not necessarily wrong or undesirable, but I recommend against preferring \" unless you're familiar and comfortable with the rules of which shell expansions it does and does not prevent.\n\n*When your expression contains a single quote character ('), this cannot be enclosed in single quotes, but it can be enclosed in double quotes. And like ', \" quoting removes special meaning from spaces, tabs, newlines (line breaks), ( and ), { and }, < and >, ;, &, |, ?, *, ~ and #. (And possibly other characters, depending on if I'm forgetting anything and on what shell options are enabled.) For example:\ndu -h \"Don't Ask Me Why (Eurythmics, 1989).flac\"\n\nThus double quotes work fine for the particular file you were deleting--whose name contained the special characters (, ), and space--and the suggestion to use them in this case was both helpful and perfectly okay.\n\n*However, unlike ', quoting with \" does not remove the special meaning from $, `, \\, and (unless history expansion is disabled) !. (Nor \", which as you'd expect is interpreted as the closing double quote. Usually.)\n\" quoting is thus useful when you don't want to prevent the shell from performing expansions based on the meaning of those characters. For example, running f='fee fi fo' followed by cat \"$f fum.txt\" prints the contents of fee fi fo fum.txt.\nBut when such behavior is unanticipated, it can cause problems:\n$ du -sh\n...\n$ rm  \"Stupid Scheme to Make $$$$$$ Quick!!!!.pdf\"\nrm  \"Stupid Scheme to Make $$$$$$ Quickdu -shdu -sh.pdf\"\nrm: cannot remove ‘Stupid Scheme to Make 453745374537 Quickdu -shdu -sh.pdf’: No such file or directory\nCharacters that retain their special meaning within \" quotes can themselves be quoted by being preceded by a \\:\n$ echo \"\\\"Windows uses '\\\\' as the path separator,\\\" screeched Multiplatform Owl wisely.\"\n\"Windows uses '\\' as the path separator,\" screeched Multiplatform Owl wisely.\n\nWhen an unquoted \\ precedes a character that doesn't need further quoting, it remains unchanged. (Thus \\\\ in the above command could simply have been a single \\.)\nInside double quotes, \\ before ! removes it special meaning (i.e., prevents history expansion). But unlike when \\ quotes other special characters, a \\ before ! is not removed. Thus, \\! is interpreted as a literal \\!, whereas \\$ is interpreted as a literal $ and \\ before a space is interpreted as a literal space.\nManual Quoting with \\\n\\ quotes a single character, the character immediately following it. (Except of course when it is itself quoted.)\nFor most characters x, \\x is equivalent to x. \\ is specifically useful when the character following it has special meaning--it removes special meaning from that character:\n$ rm -v Stupid\\ Scheme\\ to\\ Make\\ \\$\\$\\$\\$\\$\\$\\ Quick\\!\\!\\!\\!.pdf \nremoved ‘Stupid Scheme to Make $$$$$$ Quick!!!!.pdf’\n\nWhen \\ is enclosed in double quotes (\"), it works differently, as described above. It then has special meaning only when the following character is special, and otherwise is interpreted literally.\nManually writing commands with \\ is especially useful and appropriate when you don't have to use very many of them, and can be somewhat inefficient otherwise.\nFor example:\nek@Ilex:~$ pastebinit <<< Hello,\\ world!\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/8390449/\n\n(A single ! character at the end of an argument doesn't need to be quoted.)\nCombining Different Forms of Quoting\nSuppose you wanted to couldn't wouldn't shouldn't can't won't don't!! to appear literally. An easy way to achieve this would be to quote it as:\n\"couldn't wouldn't shouldn't can't won't don't\"'!!'\n\nOr (since \\ before ! only fails to be removed when double-quoted):\n\"couldn't wouldn't shouldn't can't won't don't\"\\!\\!\n\nThis can be combined with, and may be considered a variation on, quoting only part of an argument, as discussed above.\nSources / Further Reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Bash Reference Manual (see this page for other formats)\n\n*man bash (a.k.a. bash(1), the bash manpage)\n\n\nA: Spaces are not allowed in terminal, because they separate different parts of a command. So for filenames with spaces you must use quotations, as @Cornelius said, or \\ just before each space:\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/Katy\\ Perry\\ -\\ Dark\\ Horse\\ \\(Official\\)\\ ft.\\ Juicy\\ J-0KSOMA3QBU0.mp4.part\n\nSince some rare commands doesn’t accept quotations, you’d better to know about \\.\n", "Q: How to cd to $RECYCLE.BIN?

I have recently learnt about 2 different ways of editing the hosts file in Ubuntu for the purpose of blocking webpages and domains tracking my computer (protecting myself from tracking cookies), and I am a little confused here because there are guys who recommend editing the \"hosts\" file usually located in ~\\etc\\hosts by using 127.0.0.1 before adding a page address to be blocked and there are guys who recommend using 0.0.0.0 before adding a page address to be blocked.\nI have tested both ways in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 only, and all I can tell so far is that using a template in this form:\n127.0.0.1 google-analytics.com\n127.0.0.1 ssl.google-analytics.com\n\nis not good at all for my system, and it can slow down even the most common operations.\nBut I have found that using a template in this form:\n0.0.0.0 google-analytics.com\n0.0.0.0 ssl.google-analytics.com\n\nseems to be ok as far as system stability is concerned, and even the webpages are loading faster.\nMy question is whether this method (editing the hosts file) will truly work for blocking webpages and domains tracking my computer in Linux/Ubuntu. I know little about network security so I can't test properly if I am actually more protected now than before after editing this hosts file the way I seen it's meant to be done in the tutorials from the Internet.\nSo, to conclude, I have these questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which one is better to use before adding the page address to be blocked in 'hosts' file configuration, is it 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0?\n\n*How to test if my network security is better after editing the hosts file?\n\nA: You should use 127.0.0.1, the so-called loopback address. Unlike 0.0.0.0, it is a valid IPv4 address. \nWhile it is true that this mitigates some tracking issues, this does not improve security per se.\nThere are a gazillion sites that track you, and you can't keep up editing your hosts file. To prevent tracking, you'd better use plugins like AdblockPlus and NoScript that auto-update the list of sites to block.\nAlso note that security is a process, not some setting or configuration.\nTo strengthen your security, you also need to consider\n\n\n*\n\n*setting up a firewall\n\n*physical access to your machine\n\n*lots of other things that would be out-of scope here.\n\n", "Q: can i build ubuntu package without an upstream tar ball using bzr?

The background script will keep track of what is the front most application, and will set the resolution accordingly.

Both the main Matlab window and the code editor window has a persistent response lag with both typing and selecting window components. If I type, then every few seconds the interface freezes and the text I typed during the freeze displays after the second-long freeze is over.\nI'm running a dedicated i7 3770K with 32GB Ram, with 25GB free SSD system disk space, and I've never experienced this lag before. Other programs, like Chrome, Geany, Blender, SMPlayer, Firefox are all running smoothly as always.\nI tried to see if another program is hogging Java, but could find none, and the CPU usage is even 0-5% when the Matlab lag persists. When Matlab has freshly started, it does not have the lag, but after normal usage, hours later it suddenly starts lagging. Code execution seems to happen at normal speed, it's just the interface that lags.\nIf I run a second Matlab session concurrently with the first and load the same workspace and files into the code editor, then the second Matlab performs smoothly without lag at least for a couple of hours.\n\nA: The problem might be related to Matlab R2014a. I have a similar problem in Windows 7 64bit with an efficient laptop. When running some simple script over and over again doing modifications to parameters, Matlab freezes on every 2nd or 3rd \"run\". Same thing with typing in the command window. It seems like the program would fall asleep every another minute or something.\n\nA: The peculiar Matlab interface lag was probably caused by a high quantity .mat loading script I ran previously. Even when I restarted Matlab without running anything in the new session, the interface would start to lag after a while, but only when the pc was not restarted since running the .mat loading script in a previous Matlab session.\nThe fact that the problem persisted even if Matlab was restarted, made it more difficult for me to see that a previous Matlab process could be the cause of the problem, since I assumed that completely shutting down all Matlab processes would also eliminate associated effects from particular scripts that were run. \nThis assumption does not seem to hold, and it seems that loading 1000s of .mat files causes some sort of inefficiency in Matlab to rear its head. I know it is not the size of the resulting variables in the workspace, as I have routinely loaded singular .mat files and scripts producing variables with a total size exceeding 20GB, without ever experiencing such lag. It must then be 1000s of file accesses that causes the problem in Matlab.\nIf I used another Matlab 2013b install to load the 1000s of .mat files into a single data structure, then I do experience the same peculiar lag in Matlab 2014a. However, if I restart Matlab 2014a, without ever running the 1000s .mat load in 2014a but just in 2013b, then the Matlab 2014a interface does not lag afterward.\nSo, I would almost call this a type of bug in Matlab 2013/2014 that is at least related to loading 1000s of .mat files. My temporary solution is to use Matlab 2013b to load the files and concatenate them into a singular .mat, and restarting Matlab 2014a if it was open.\n", "Q: Desktop Freezes every few min Ever so often on Ubuntu 14.04 my desktop freezes.

If double clicking on it does nothing but open gedit to edit it then you need to go into the terminal, type cd /path/to/compressed/file/ then ./<filename> to launch it.\n\nA: If your application is released also as a .deb file, you can download and open it with \"GDebi package installer\". \nTo install gdebi on Debian, Ubuntu or Linux Mint, run the following.\nsudo apt-get install gdebi\n\nThe gdebi utility has two components: gdebi for a command-line tool, and gdebi-gtk for graphical front-end.\nYou have to right click on the file> Open with> GDebi... Wait for the check, then click on Install package.\nBTW, terminal is the quickest way to do anything in Linux (and maybe not only in Linux).

But where are the instructions for this located? The ones located on Free Desktop don't specify the format for the directory file, and I can't find any others on the Internet. When I've just put something like:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Directory\nName=My Directory\nPath=/home/me/mydir\nIcon=/home/me/mydir.ico\n\nit hasn't worked.\n\nA: The most basic version of a .desktop file to open a directory:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Files\nExec=nautilus /path/to/your/directory\nIcon=/path/to/your/icon\nType=Application\n\nSo the type still should to be set to Type=Application.\nYou can make a .desktop file do anything, just by setting the right command in the Exec= line.

Any idea?\n\nA: If there is no need for a native installation oft Windows XP I'd advice you to use kvm-qemu or hyper-v running XP as a guest OS instead oft wasting a partition for XP. The benefit oft this approach is the that you can keep you XP as as large as really needed and you need not to struggle with bootloaders etc.\nPlease note that hyper-v must be downloaded from MS and Windows 7 isn't supporting all its features thus it was introduced with windows 8.\n", "Q: unable to mount New Volume from Ubuntu 14.04 This question has been asked here and here.\nI have a dual boot system with Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 but I am not able to open New Volume from Ubuntu.

It means that your sound card is not even recognized. Puff!\n\nNo worries. The one shot solution which fixed the sound problem for me on my Intel powered Dell Inspiron N4010 is to force reload Alsa. To do that, use the following command in terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\nThe output will be like this.\n\nYou may think that it is hanged or still in processing but it takes only couple of seconds. You can simply close it afterwards by using Ctrl+C. Now, you need to reboot your computer. If at the next start up, you hear the login sound at the lock screen, you know it worked like a charm.\n\nFirst Alternate method to fix no sound in Ubuntu 14.04:\nIf the above problem did not fix it for you, try reinstalling Alsa and Pulse audio in the following manner:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base pulseaudio\nsudo apt-get install alsa-base pulseaudio\n\nAnd force reload Alsa again:\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\nRestart and enjoy the world of sound, again.\nSecond Alternate method to fix no sound in Ubuntu 14.04:\nOpen the terminal and edit speech-dispatcher file by using the following command:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/speech-dispatcher\n\nIn here, change RUN=yes to RUN=no\nReboot and enjoy sound.\n[source]\n", "Q: phpmyadmin not found I am using Ubuntu 14.04.

Just recently 4 bugs in the Packet Manager Apt (the main in Ubuntu) has been discovered. Especially bad for 12.04 LTS as 4 security holes have been found there.\nMy question is to what dangers have Apt bugs security holes (USN-2348-1) caused?\nThe explanations are on http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2348-1/ are rather brief and only state\n\nIt was discovered that APT did not re-verify downloaded files when the\n  If-Modified-Since wasn't met. (CVE-2014-0487)\nIt was discovered that APT did not invalidate repository data when it\n  switched from an unauthenticated to an authenticated state.\n  (CVE-2014-0488)\nIt was discovered that the APT Acquire::GzipIndexes option caused APT\n  to skip checksum validation. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04\n  LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and was not enabled by default.\n  (CVE-2014-0489)\nIt was discovered that APT did not correctly validate signatures when\n  manually downloading packages using the download command. This issue\n  only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-0490)\n\nFurther information i.e. by following to\nhttp://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2014/CVE-2014-0488.html\nand then trying to read about the bug on \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/%2Bbug/1366702\ndo not yield information as the launchpad.net site is a dead link.\nA response to this question would be to describe what the 4 security wholes would mean by means of an example. \nAlso it would be interesting to know if users that only used\napt-get install [packagename] and apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade could have been given malicious debfiles or respository listings.\n\nA: This is my personal analysis of the CVEs, read this with a grain of salt.\nPreface: signing keys\nMost repositories digitally sign their packages and lists using such a key. For the official repos, the keys are installed together with the base system. If you manually add a repository either directly by adding it to your /etc/apt/sources.lst or /etc/apt/sources.list.d, then you need to add that repository's key manually:  \napt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com ID\n\nor apt-key add FILEin case you downloaded the key separately.\nI'm not 100% sure, but IMHO when using the software center or add-apt-repository, the key is installed automatically.\nUbuntu users that never added a repository (PPA) to their system should have all necessary keys.\nUsers that actually use repositories without having imported a signing key see a warning along the lines below when installing from those repos:\n\nYou are about to install software that can't be authenticated! Doing\n  this could allow a malicious individual to damage or take control of\n  your system.\n\nCVE-2014-0487\nIf a hash in the Release file changes, but the file being referred to by the Release file gets served with a 304 response (http status code 304), apt ignored the updated file and continued to use the old version of the file, even though the old version of the file didn't match the new hash.\nSource\nIf an attacker somehow had managed to make you download a malicious package, said attacker could make your system use the old, malicious, files that had already been downloaded, instead of a more recent file available from the repo.\nIf you never used repositories without having a valid signing key for the repo, you're probably not affected.\nCVE-2014-0488\nIt was discovered that APT did not properly invalidate unauthenticated data. Imagine that you use an unauthenticated repo. You download / install / ... packages from that repo and only later add a signing key for that repo.\nAll the data that's already been downloaded is just kept. It is theoretically possible, that you have downloaded forged data, because at the time you were unable to verify that (due to the lack of a signing key). Now apt would be able to verify the downloaded data, but it didn't. (Instead it could also just throw away everything downloaded from that repo and download new, this time - with a signing key present - it could verify the downloads).\nIf you never used repositories without having a valid signing key for the repo, you're probably not affected.\nCVE-2014-0489\nThere's an option called Acquire::GzipIndexesin apt. This option disabled by default.\nHere's what the manpage says about it:\n   GzipIndexes\n       When downloading gzip compressed indexes (Packages, Sources, or\n       Translations), keep them gzip compressed locally instead of\n       unpacking them. \n\nThe issue was, that if you had set this to yes, then the checksum check was not performed, leading to potentially forged packages being downloaded / installed / ...\nPersonal note: I could not find if Acquire::CompressionTypes::Order:: \"gz\"; also skipped the checksum check.\nIf you never set Acquire::GzipIndexes in your apt.conf, you're probably not affected by this issue.\nCVE-2014-0490\nYou can use apt-get download to download packages. If you do so and do not have the repository signing key, then you download packages which you can't verify the integrity of (because you lack the key). In this case, apt should have warned you that you're doing something potentially unsafe, so you can think twice about installing these packages.\nThe issue is: apt didn't notice the user.\nIf you never used apt-get download, you're probably not affected by this issue.\nPatches\nClick here to see the relevant patchset for Debian.\nMy statements are purely informational, do not rely on them\n\nA: If you are using supported releases of Ubuntu then these & other security flaws of note are usually taken care of promptly.
