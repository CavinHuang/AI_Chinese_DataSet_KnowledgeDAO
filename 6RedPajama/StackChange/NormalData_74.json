["Q: How to create a custom readable symlink out of a sandboxed container? How do I create a readable symlink from within a ~/Library/Containers/.../Data/ app folder to a file outside?\nIt seems that due to the macOS sandboxing mechanism, this doesn't work out of the box. That is, I can create a symlink fine, but the app I use won't be allowed to read the symlinked file.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*My intent is to customize the setup of my own machine. I'm not an app developer.\n\n*Editing the file Container.plist within ~/Library/Containers/.../ might help. So far, I've not had success yet.\n\n*Personal use case: being able to open an app from two different user accounts on the same machine and share the same app-database.\n\n\nA: Unlikely to be Possible\nI suspect that if this were possible with a symlink, Apple would consider it a serious security flaw.\nThat said, see Why is the symlink I created inside an application container to allow for external storage not working? for possible solutions.\nSandboxed applications can only read the contents their containers, some global locations, and the locations explicitly granted to them by the user – via the Powerbox mechanism.\nSee Powerbox and File System Access Outside of Your Container:\n\nYour sandboxed app can access file system locations outside of its container in the following three ways:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*At the specific direction of the user\n  \n*By using entitlements for specific file-system locations (described in > - Entitlements and System Resource Access)\n  \n*When the file system location is in certain directories that are world readable\n  \n\nGiven the list above, you may be able to extend the entitlements for the application to include your specific location and then resign the application.\nBypass the Problem\nAlternatively, consider stripping the application of its sandboxing entitlement. You could try ad-hoc resigning the application and omit the entitlements entirely.\n", "Q: Multiple Words Search in a single PDF with Mac I am looking for any software for Mac (free or not) that is capable to use boolean operator in search (within PDF). To be more precise I would like a software where if I put “apple OR orange OR banana” in search field, I would like to see every occurrence of only the word “apple” and “orange” and “banana” in search results, all together, instead of doing the search for each word. It is similar to the advanced search PDF-XChange Viewer on Windows. Preview app can handle that but it is not reliable. Could you help me?\n\nA: Adobe originally developed the Portable Document Format (PDF). The viewer for these types of documents is a free product called Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. This has an advance search where you can search for the occurrences of \"apple\" or \"orange\" or \"banana\". Below is an illustration of the search window.\n\n", "Q: Trying to recover data from an external RAID drive I have a 1 TB Western Digital external hard drive that is old but works fine, I also have a 4 TB WD RAID (2 x 2 TB hard drives in one casing) that stopped working which I'm trying to recover. I must say it turns on when I plug it, but mac doesn't recognize it.\nI pulled out HDD #1 from the 4 TB RAID, then connected it via the SATA connection to the housing of the 1 TB. Physically, it connected without a problem, but my Mac doesnt recognize the \"new\" drive.\nAny ideas what I should do in order to see the data from the 2 TB HDD?\n\nA: If your RAID is 4 TB from 2 x 2 TB then it is RAID 0, a stripe set where one 2 TB drive is an \"extension\" of the other. Each 2 TB drive won't work by itself. If any of them fails, the other is useless. This setup is useful for write and read speed, but it decreases confidence in the set.\nSo, if you pull any of the 2 TB drives from the set and tries to use it, it won't work. You need to repartition the drive as a single drive (no RAID), but then the other drive will be useless forever (you destroyed on of the drives in the set.\nIf it was RAID 1 (mirror), you would have 2 TB from the 2 x 2 TB set, but each drive would be an exact copy of the other and you should be able to use each one by itself. This setup seems a waste of space but it increases confidence in the set since any 1 drive failing would still allow you to access your data.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt 3 - Thunderbolt 2 problem I have a new MacMini, OS 10.15.3 and I am trying to connect a new Presonus Quantum Thunderbolt Interface to the Mac.\nThe Presonus has two TB 2 connections, the Mac has TB 3 connections.\nI have connected an Apple TB3 to TB2 adapter to the Mac and a 3m Delock TB2 cable from the adapter to the Presonus. \nI am using LOGIC recording software and the Mac/LOGIC will not detect the Presonus.\nI need your help and advice please.\n\nA: On the Presonus forum it appears I am not the only one with this connection problem. There are very many unhappy un-users on there...\nI uninstalled and reinstalled their Universal Control software several times and tried different approaches. One thing I did discover is it is very important to open the Security and Privacy section in Mac system preferences and change the settings to allow third party software. \nI also followed the advice of a contributer on the Presonus forum, advice which is not mentioned in the Presonus setup information... \nFollowing an install of the Universal Control software you switch off the Quantum and unplug the TB cable. You reboot, reconnect the TB cable and switch on the Quantum and it worked. Thanks for the advice and happy recording.\n\nA: The Mac has Core i7 and the correct Presonus Universal Control software installed.\nSince I received your reply, I have made some headway on the problem. I reinstalled the Presonus UC software and checked the Mac Finder. The Quantum is now listed under Thunderbolt Device Tree so that's one problem sorted, thank you.\nThe problem I now face is trying to get the Quantum to sync with the Mac.\n", "Q: Is there a GUI difftool that does symlinks? Let's say I have some directories with symlinks in them.\n.\n├── dirA\n│   ├── file013\n│   └── file212\n└── dirB\n    ├── file013\n    └── file212\n\n2 directories, 4 files\n\nThe symlinks are pointing to directories with lots of files and directories that I don't care about, so I've used symlinks to isolate them.  I can edit them just fine, for example, and the changes are done on the actual files.\nI want to compare say A.file013 <> B.file013\nOh, I and I mostly work from the terminal, so looking for \n$ awesome_diff dirA/file013 dirB/file013 : diff 1 file pair\n\n\n*\n\n*opendiff/Filemerge does do this, actually. ✅  so does ksdiff/Kaleidoscope.\n\n\nand\n$ awesome_diff dirA dirB : diff at directory level.\n\n\n*\n\n*compare directory contents, drill down into directories, drill down into\nindividual file diffs....\n\n\n*\n\n*opendiff/Filemerge fails this ❌ as it will then consider only the symlinks' own pointers.  ksdiff/Kaleidoscope also ❌\n\n\n\n(still appreciate GUI-only answers)\ngood:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnu diff : does a fine job, but terminal-only.  Most GUI diff tools provide line by line copy functionality.\n\n\nbad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Filemerge/opendiff compares symlink file pointers, not file contents.  actually, if you launch Filemerge, the GUI, from the start it does work, but the command line opendiff calls the Filemerge incorrectly.\n\n*Kaleidoscope - file type (symlink) not supported\nunknown/install issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kdiff3 - compares, but otherwise broken at 0.998 release, the menu doesn't work at all for example.\n\n*Meld - haven't gotten it to work on macos yet.\n\n*Diffmerge - haven't gotten it to work on macos yet.\n\n\nenv:  Mojave\n\nA: Both Filemerge and opendiff work with symlinks, so \nopendiff symlink-to-foo symlink-to-bar\n\nwill open Filemerge and compare foo vs bar .\n", "Q: Mac ignores Headphones after sleep The problem is that the Mac ignores the connected 3.5 headphones after sleep, but this does not apply to Bluetooth.

URL: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5541299\nSo this issue has somewhat a long history, and my MacBook Pro 2019 model with macOS 10.15.3 has the same problem. In most cases, the way to trigger it is to make Mac sleep with headphones plugged in.\nTo solve this issue temporarily, my suggestion is to plug out your headphones and plug it in again whenever you encounter the issue, it works for me each time.\nIf you want to handle this problem in a more serious way, this thread in AskDifferent community may help you:\nMavericks: No sound after sleep\nPlease notice, this problem may have something to do with a hidden flaw in macOS which hasn't be repaired over several major OS versions (this is purely personal guess), so on the Internet I haven't found an authentic answer for the reason and solution of this issue. Still, you may give the different methods a try and see if one of these solve your problem.\n", "Q: How to make macOS open RAR archive in Terminal using unrar on double-click? I want to make macOS open RAR files: On double-click macOS should open Terminal with command unrar x /path/filename.rar\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: Launch Automator.app and create a new Application.\nAdd the \"Run Shell Script\" action. As unrar seems to be a command installed in /usr/local/bin/, set the Shell type to /bin/bash, and Pass input to as arguments.\nYou'll be given a free bit of shell code, which you can easily modify:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    /usr/local/bin/unrar x \"$f\"\ndone\n\nSave the app. Then select a .rar file, choose File > Get Info, and change the default handler for that type to your new app. \nAlternatively, there are plenty of third-party apps that unwrap rar and other archive types, such as TheUnarchiver.\n", "Q: Repair a damaged partition after a (partitionDisk) action in Recovery Mode, macOS?

Below is an explanation of what happened.\nThe first common you entered is repeated below.\ndiskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk0 GPT free Linux 100G\n\nThis command erased the contents of EFI partition (disk0s1) and created a new EFI partition. Next, the command created a 100 GB partition of free space. This free space is created destructively. This means that at least the beginning of the free space is zeroed out. Unfortunately, this happened to be where the header of the APFS container for your macOS resided. At this point, recovery becomes somewhere between extremely difficult to impossible.\n\nNote: The diskutil command was destructive because disk0s2 already existed. This is done so a gpt (or other command) could not create a partition containing a volume which could be corrupted and/or potentially overlap another existing partition.\n\nThe next command you entered is given below.\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0\n\nThis command did nothing. Basically, the command replaced the GUID type value of the second entry in the GPT with zeros, but the type was already zero.\nThe third command is shown below.\ngpt -r show disk0\n\nThis command shows you just have the EFI partition (disk0s1).\nThe next command is shown below.\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 195311549 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\nThis command did create a new partition (disk0s2) of type APFS. However, the header of the original APFS partition was replaced with zeros when you entered the first command.\nThe next command you entered is shown below.\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s2\n\nEven if you had a valid APFS container, there would have been some sort of error message. This is because you have booted to a version of macOS recovery that has no knowledge of the APFS.\nThe final command is given below.\ndiskutil list\n\nThe output does not show Apple_APFS for disk0s2. Instead what is shown is 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC, which is the GUID type for a APFS container partition. This happed because the version of macOS recovery you booted to predates the introduction of APFS.\nWhat you should have entered.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 899.8G free none 0\n\nThe value of 899.8G is computed below.\n1000.0 G Bytes = Drive size\n   0.2 G Bytes = EFI partition size\n 100.0 G Bytes = Desired free space for Linux\n--------\n 899.8 G Bytes\n\n \n", "Q: Is there a way to change permission of Desktop Pictures folder? In System/Library/Desktop Pictures there are a lot of desktop wallpapers. \nI like to open them in photoshop, add some text and then save them there again. \nIs there a way to change the permission of that folder as to allow be to add  my own pictures?\nI tried the usual - get info -> open the lock, change to read and write. \nI get the error \"The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have the necessary permission.\" but I thought I was the admin user!\n\nA: If you're using MacOS 'Catalina' (or earlier): An alternative that's easier (and safer?) to changing permissions, and may achieve your objective: \n\nApple lets you choose an arbitrary folder for Desktop Pictures, so copy everything you want to a folder in the /Users/Shared or your /Users home folder and modify them to your pleasing.\n\nHere's how: To add folders you already own to your choices for Desktop graphics, use the \"Desktop dialog\" as shown below. Simply right-click any desktop & select Change Desktop Background to access this dialog.\n\nFor pre-Catalina systems (the following works on my Mojave system), the Desktop Pictures folder is located in /Library/Desktop Pictures. It's also hidden by default, so you must enter open /Library at the CLI to see it. However, once you've found it in Finder, you can change the permissions. \nThere are several ways to set the permissions you need, but let's use the approach w/ Finder: Once you've gotten the Get Info window open in Finder, click the lock, authenticate yourself (as an admin user). After that, you can change the permissions for group wheel to Read & Write. Once you've selected the Read & Write permissions, you must click the small gear at the bottom of the window, and \"Apply\" the changes. At this point, you'll be presented with a confirmation dialog similar to this: \n\nOnce this has been completed, you should be able to add and delete (or modify) any pictures in /Library/Desktop Pictures. \n", "Q: Can I attach a .dmg without mounting the drive that it is sitting in? I have a .dmg sitting on an external drive (which also contains other data).\nThe .dmg is an image of a failed drive so I can't mount it but I want to attach the .dmg without mounting the partition it is in.\nIs this possible?\nI ask because, if I mount the partition, attach the .dmg and then try to run TestDisk, TestDisk returns this message:\nWrite access for this media is not available.\nTestDisk won't be able to modify it.\n\n- No partition from this disk must be mounted:\nOpen the Disk Utility (In Finder -> Application -> Utility folder)\nand press Unmount button for each volume from this disk\n\nI tried what I thought would work: hdiutil attach /dev/disk2s2/cfp/disk0s2-clone.dmg it didn't, attach failed - Not a Directory\nI guess a different way of asking my question is, \"How can I use TestDisk on a .dmg if I can't mount the partition that the .dmg is in?\"\n\nA: If you mount a drive one of the things which happens is that the file system type gets identified so macOS afterwards knows how to access the content of the drive (and find the DMG for instance). So operating systems can't access files on a drive without mounting it first.\nYour actual problem seems to come from the fact that TestDisk is a tool to recover data from physical drives. So it could be used to work with the original disk your DMG represents, but it won't be able to recover data from a DMG.\n\nA: The reason testdisk fails is because it needs to write to the device, but your dmg is probably stored in read-only format, so it is not able to write to the virtual device that represents the dmg.\nBecause it's not smart enough to check if the device is a read-only media (like read-only dmg), it assumes that it cannot write to the disk because a partition is mounted. When a partition is mounted, it's locked/write protected so that you don't lose data.\nTo solve this, you can either \"restore\" the dmg to an actual physical drive then run testdisk on it, or you can mount this dmg as read-write using a shadow file. See man hdiutil for more details.\n-shadow [shadowfile]\n                     Use a shadow file in conjunction with the data in the pri-\n                     mary image file.  This option prevents modification of the\n                     original image and allows read-only images to be attached\n                     read/write.  When blocks are being read from the image,\n                     blocks present in the shadow file override blocks in the\n                     base image.  All data written to an attached device will\n                     be redirected to the shadow file.  If not specified,\n                     shadowfile defaults to image.shadow. If the shadow file\n                     does not exist, it is created.  hdiutil verbs taking\n                     images as input accept -shadow, -cacert, and\n                     -insecurehttp.\n\nSo your command would probably look something like: hdiutil attach -nomount -noverify /path/to/dmg -shadow (/path/to/shadow/file (optional))\n\nA: Running hdiutil attach -nomount -verbose ~/Downloads/test.dmg will attach the disk but not mount it. Here is the view from Disk Utility after running the command.\n\n", "Q: Show/hide Accessibility Keyboard with a keyboard shortcut in MacOS Catalina? I would like to display and hide the Accessibility Keyboard in MacOS Catalina using a shortcut.\nThe old solution from thread How to show or hide Keyboard Viewer with a keyboard shortcut? is not working since the update to MacOS Catalina. KeyboardViewer.app is not anymore in /System/Library/Input Methods/\n\nA: A workaround I found was to use \"hot corners\" to toggle the visibility of the virtual keyboard. Unfortunately this does require using the mouse, just moving it to a screen corner to activate a command.\nYou can access the hot corners tab from the accessibility keyboard settings (gear icon -> Preferences).\nThe \"Hide/Show Home Panel\" is the default and correct option. I like to unselect the \"Panel follows Hide/Show Home Panel\" so the Panel doesn't move around.\nNote that this will only work if the accessibility keyboard is activated.

Sometimes, when I use it with the (original) adapter, it says that the power source is power adapter, but the battery is still draining and not charging:\n\nThis is a huge problem as the level of charge can become very low before I even notice it. Also, I'm not doing any resource-intensive work. As an experiment I left it running and observed the charge get down to 40% before I disconnect the cable and reconnect so the charging would start.\nWhat may be causing this issue?\n\nA: \nit says that the power source is power adapter, but the battery is still draining and not charging:\n\nThere's three possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*Battery Management is Enabled.  Catalina introduced a feature called Battery Health Management where it will lower the maximum charge while in this mode.  If connected to a charger, it may appear that the Mac isn't charging.\n\n\n*Defective battery.  It happens.  Even on new computers.  Basically, the battery is not holding a charge meaning it discharges faster than it can be charged.  In this case the battery needs to be replaced.  There are some steps you can take to diagnose the battery.\n\n\n*Defective charger.  The fact that you said \"Sometimes when you use it with the original adapter...\" points to an intermittent problem.  Your charger may not be able to supply the needed current to both charge the battery and power your laptop.  There's also the possibility that you're using the incorrect charger.  For example, you may be using the 61 watt charger when the MacBook Pro requires the 87 watt charger.\nThe easiest thing to do is to try a different and correct charger for your MacBook Pro. If the problem persists even after you try a different charger, it's likely your battery and you'll need to take it in for service.\n\nA: I found that I could get a port that was not working to start working by unplugging the cable at the power adapter (leaving it plugged in at the laptop) and then reconnecting it. It's not clear to me what this is doing or if it's placebo, but it's odd.\n\nA: Although my experience is with an older MagSafe 2 model, this may work for later MacBooks as well:\n\n*\n\n*Look for debris / corrosion / gunk on both sides of the connection.\n\n*Plug charger  out and shut down laptop\n\n*Clean both plug and socket terminals with toothpick / cotton swab immersed in pure alcohol or  appropriate cleansing solution\n\n*Wait some seconds for solution to evaporate and reconnect\n\n\nA: I too had this problem and then I found this article on Apple website https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/mac-help/mh20876/mac . Read the third point on the website, try turning off the Battery Health Management in Energy Saver Preference. The charging resumed immediately on my Macbook after I did that.\n\nA: Well, Apple care replaced the entire logic board but it did not fix the problem in my case. Later I discovered that is was faulty charging cable.\nTherefore, I suggest to check with alternate charging cable and charger first.

Note that the native fork's data is preferred even if the data in the AppleDouble file is newer.\n--keep=dotbar\n\nAlways use information stored in the AppleDouble file, replacing any extended attributes associated with the native file.\n--keep=native\n\nAlways use the information associated with the data fork, ignoring any AppleDouble files.\nYou can consult man dot_clean for further information and options.\nYou might remove some uncertainty by determining whether the files with an associated dot bar have any resource fork information attached without reference to the dot bar files.  This might be somewhat involved to test, as copying the files might re-incorporate the dot bar files during the copy.\nYou may not care, or may not care to spend the time to determine, and simply run dot_clean with its default option.\nOr, you could ignore the issue for now and not exclude the dot bar files during your rsync backups.\nIt should be pointed out that much of this discussion is in regards to how to treat the source/origin of the backup.  Presumably, the purpose of a backup is to duplicate as exactly as possible the source.  As such, I would not exclude the dot bar files as part of your backup.  Instead, I would look to the reason the dot bar files exist in your source.  Then, whether, and later how, to \"fix\" them.\n", "Q: Does the Transcend JetDrive Lite 360 fit on iMac? Transcend JetDrive 360 is a nice option to expand storage on mbp 15\" Mid 2015. \nI'm wondering if it can be used on iMac also, can someone confirm? Or somewhere else besides mbp 2015.\n\nA: This FAQ at Transcend (which is linked to at the bottom of the link you provided) indicates indirectly that the only non-laptop mac compatible with the JetDrive Lite series is a Mac Mini.\nI used one of these JetDrive devices several years ago on a 2nd gen MBA, and it is designed to lie flush with the edge of the laptop to prevent damage whilst in a bag or elsewhere. If I were going to try using one of these devices, I'd choose the one with the greatest length to make sure it seats correctly in the internal SD socket.\nOn the other hand, any of the high-performance SD cards now on the market will be much less of a pain to use with your iMac. Personally, I'd choose a SanDisk, Sony or Transcend SD card.\nRemember that no matter how much improvement has been made in the quality of SD card fabrication and data reliability over the years, they are still more fragile than other data storage media, and are susceptible to data loss from static shock and other environmental conditions such as high magnetic fields, moisture and excessive heat.\nDisclaimer: I'm a satisfied user of SanDisk, Sony and Transcend products, and have no financial or other ties with these companies.\n", "Q: Screenshot Folder Actions Ideally, I would be able to take a screenshot and paste the image directly into iA Writer.

I've got dozens of programs and in some cases the developers have disappeared. \nLooked at this similar question: Time Machine alternatives to clone one mac book to another\nbut it doesn't contain any information about restoration of registration information for purchased programs. \n\nA: Time Machine backs up every file on the target volume. So any method of storing the registration that involves files on your disk can be restored from a TM backup. No other software is required.\nSo it's up to you to restore the required files. For instance, relevant data may be in .plist files in the user or root level Library/Preferences or /Library/Application Support folders.\nHowever, many developers understandably use hidden files and obfuscated methods to store registration details and confirm authorised usage. \nIf you selectively restored files and folders from your backup, then you won't have restored those hidden files. You can see hidden files in the Finder and Time Machine by pressing Shift Command . \nIt may be easiest just to clone the entire disk, so you may want to try SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner; though I've found that this doesn't always work: Devs may hash hardware characteristics, such as the volume's UUID, in order to ensure that the software won't work without re-registration on new hardware.\nIt's always a good idea to keep all the serial numbers in text files in a folder for just this occasion, which isn't usually needed very often. I also still have the emails which provided the serials when I made the purchase.\n", "Q: OpenSSL installation in macOS Mojave 10.14.6? I am getting odd errors that OpenSSL package has some problems. Earlier I insntalled PyCharm IDE that is built on pyenv environment, it may have somehow broken my OpenSSL. I have tried to install OpenSSL again with brew install openssl but errors such as the below persist.\nHow to install OpenSSL in Mac OSX Mojave 10.14.6?\npip3 install numpy\npip is configured with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the ssl module in Python is not available.\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (1.16.2)\npip is configured with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the ssl module in Python is not available.\nCould not fetch URL https://pypi.org/simple/pip/: There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='pypi.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /simple/pip/ (Caused by SSLError(\"Can't connect to HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.\")) - skipping\n\n\nA: The SSL module is ordinarily a part of the python installation itself. The fact that you haven't got it doesn't mean that anything is wrong with your OpenSSL package or anything like that - rather it is python's own SSL module that is missing.\nYou can usually fix this by reinstalling python with this command from the Terminal:\nbrew reinstall python\n\nThe fact that you mention OpenSSL seems to indicate that you have received some messages about OpenSSL or in other ways that you haven't really told the full story in the few lines of output in your question. If this is the case, it could be that you're trying to recompile something that needs OpenSSL. In that case, you'll need to install the development files (headers) for OpenSSL using this command:\nbrew install openssl\n\nAfterwards you can use stuff like the python installation manager to upgrade python like this:\npythonz install 3.8.2 --configure=\"--with-openssl=$(brew --prefix openssl)\"\n\n", "Q: Permission denied when accessing backup directory I used iTunes to make a backup of my iPhone. I can see the backup directory using Finder, at /Users/ronaldfischer/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup.

This attribute is usually set on (usually an executable) file which is downloaded from somewhere, and ensures that MacOS is asking you \"Do you really trust this file?\" the first time it is opened. Maybe the attribute has been set because backing up my iPhone in effect means that external programs are downloaded.\nHowever, this is likely not the reason of the strange behaviour, because I also get an operation not permitted, when I try to remove this attribute using xattr -d. Furthermore, @Seamus said in his comment, that he did not have this attribute being set, but also has no permission. Perhaps it is a glitch in this OS version? I'm still running Mojave (10.14.6).\n\nA: You'll be able to read the directory if you grant Full Disk Access to your terminal program (e.g. Terminal.app or iTerm2).\nIn macOS 13 Ventura: Apple Menu › System Settings › Privacy & Security › Full Disk Access.\nIn previous verisons of macOS: Apple Menu › System Preferences › Security & Privacy › Privacy › Full Disk Access.\n", "Q: Are there any iOS SSH terminal apps that support truecolor (i.e., 24 bit color)?

Meaning, when I use whatever way to make my mac sleep, it turns off Wifi too, and when I wake it up, Wifi gets turned on automatically. Is there a way? Thanks\n\nA: SleepWatcher 2.2.1 can do this, and for free. However, if you do not have administrator access to your Mac (and it sounds like you might not) then you might not be able to install it. Worth a shot, but just FYI that it might not work.\nKeyboard Maestro can do this, even without admin access, but it is not free. I think it's $35.

I have looked at other posts/problems online, and I have tried to blow into the card reader (someone said that it helped). But it didn't do anything.\nWhen I look at sharing and permissions for the SD card it says you have custom access.\nSo if anyone has any ideas about how I can format this, it would be great.\n\nA: Below itemizes some of the problems with procedure posted in your question.\n\n\n*\n\n*As others have posted in the comments and answers, you need to precede the fdisk command with sudo.\n\n*Other users have suggested that the security setting need to be modified. The version of macOS used for verifying this answer was Catalina version 10.15.3. Below is the System Preferences setting in the Security & Privacy pane. Under Full Disk Access, the Terminal application is not checked off, as shown below.\n\nUnder Files and Folders, the following was checked off for Terminal.\n\n\n*The fdisk command in your question is not being applied to a drive. The identifier disk2s1 could represent a partition, container, session or volume. While the fdisk command can allow for this, there is no logical reason for doing so. The device should be of the form /dev/diskN where N is a positive integer. Care should be taken to confirm you are actually referring to the SD card.\n\n*The fdisk can be an interactive command. This means the command can require text read from standard input. This text is often referred to a input commands. Under Linux, fdisk defaults to interactive. However under macOS, fdisk does not. To make fdisk interactive under macOS, the ‑e option must be included. In your question, this option was omitted.\n\n*You tried to pipe the input commands to fdisk. Each individual command was separated by a space (). However, each command should have been separated by a newline (\\n). Basically a newline is the same as entering a return from the keyboard. Also the string should have be enclosed by the characters $'' instead of \"\".\n\n*The input commands to fdisk presented in your questions would be valid if the operating system was Arch Linux. The equivalent commands which would be correct under macOS are given below.\nerase\nprint\nedit 1\nc\nn\n2048\n204800\nedit 2\n83\nn\n\n\nquit\ny\n\nThe correcting for the above errors would lead to the command shown below.

You will need to replace diskN with the correct identifier.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the command reports Resource busy, you need to unmount the drive first using the command given below.\nsudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN\n\n\n*If the command reports Operation not permitted you need to disable SIP before continuing.\n\nNote: I would strongly recommend disabling SIP as a last resort.\n\n\n*If the command reports Permission denied, the partition table of the SD card is being protected against being overwritten by macOS. Erase the SD card's partition table using this command:\nsudo diskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskN 1 MBR \"Free Space\" \"%noformat%\" 100%\n\nThat command will also set the permissions on the device to allow writing. \nIMO, I believe you should attempt to use Arch Linux instead of macOS. I tried installing the latest Arch Linux in a VirtualBox virtual machine. (VirtualBox is a a free product). However, I could not get the virtual machine to work with the builtin SD card reader on my iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013). I had no better luck with an external USB SD card reader. Maybe I did not have the correct settings or maybe different hardware would make the difference. Also, I did not try using the sudo vboxmanage internalcommands createrawvmdk ... commands to expose the SD card to the virtual machine.\nInstead of a virtual machine, I opted to try a live version of Arch Linux. Here, Arch Linux was able to access the external SD card reader, but not the internal reader. Live means you create a Arch Linux bootable USB flash drive. Once you boot from the flash drive, you can enter the commands to install Arch Linux on the SD card. The Arch Linux ISO file was name archlinux-2020.03.01-x86_64.iso and came from this website, although other mirrors can be found here.\nThe instructions for using macOS to create the bootable flash drive can be found here. An image taken from this website is shown below.\n\n\nNote: My iMac has a wireless keyboard. Arch Linux failed to work with this keyboard. I had to resort to a wired keyboard.\n\nI did hypothesize that your question came from a website such as this one. An image of the installation instructions is shown below.\n\nIn testing, I modified the above instructions so the downloaded file would be stored on the SD card. After installing this file can be deleted. To stored the file on the SD card, replace the commands given in step 5 with the commands shown below\ncd root\nwget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-4-latest.tar.gz\ncd ..\nbsdtar -xpf root/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-4-latest.tar.gz -C root\nsync\n\n \n\nA: On recent versions of macOS it is no longer enough to have root privileges in form of for example the sudo command, you've tested according to the comments. By default the user is protected from programs that could cause problems with the disk itself.\nIn order to get the correct permission, you have to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple menu open \"System Preferences\"\n\n*Choose \"Security & Privacy\"\n\n*Select the \"Privacy\" tab\n\n*In the left hand menu, select \"Full Disk Access\"\n\n*Click the \"lock\" icon in the lower left-hand corner and enter your password\n\n*Click the \"plus\" icon to add to the list\n\n*Choose to add /Applications/Utilities/Terminal to the list\n\n\nNow close your Terminal application and start it again. Now the Terminal has privileges to access full disks.\nThen you can run your fdisk command again, remember to prefix it with sudo:\nsudo fdisk [rest of the command]\n\nNOTE: Always remember to check and double check that the disk you want to mess with is actually still /dev/disk2s1 so that you don't mess with the wrong disk.\nEVEN BIGGER NOTE: It seems to me that the command you're trying to run is really for Linux. That command won't work with fdisk on macOS.\nThe fdisk command you have works by automating a number of key presses in the fdisks menus: \"o p n p 1 +100M t c n p 2 w\"\nWhat it actually achieves is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creates an empty DOS partition table\n\n*Creates a new primary partition number 1 of 100 MB \n\n*Sets the system id of the new partition as \"W95 FAT32 (LBA)\"\n\n*Creates a new primary partition number 2 with the rest of the space\nYou can do the same with the macOS fdisk tool, or you could use the graphical DiskUtility to do the same. Note that what fdisk calls \"DOS partition table\" is referred to as \"MBR\" in Disk Utility.\nA DIFFERENT DIRECTION:\nDavidAnderson in the comments write that you're really following this guide for installing ArchLinux on a Raspberry Pi 4. I cannot know if that is correct or not - but I think it cannot be that specific guide, as your command that automates the fdisk commands is not in that guide. However, it does seem likely that you're trying to follow a similar guide to install ArchLinux on a Raspberry Pi.\nIf that is the case, I would advise you to either use a Linux computer for following the instructions, or if that is not available, then install VirtualBox or similar (VMware, Parallels, etc.) on your Mac and install ArchLinux here, so that you can follow the guide again.\n", "Q: Do native screensavers have a hidden configuration to show image file name/path?

That's because I have the page number in the footer and I do want to show it, even on the first page. How can I do this?\nAt first I thought I could just put the first page into a separate section, but that breaks up paragraphs that flow from the first page onto the second.\nIf this is not possible with Pages, do you know of another word processor that can do this?\nEDIT: Here's an overview of the problem situation:\n\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different!\nSorry that I don't know the proper solution to your problem through Pages or any other word processor. If you can not find such a solution and still want to do this, you would maybe like to consider doing something similar through a text box in Pages as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hide the Headers & Footers on the first page again, \n\n*Place a text box via Insert > Text Box menu option and write 1 in it. You can resize the text box by click-and-holding and then dragging one of the selection handles in its edges with a mouse, \n\n*Place the text box at the same location where the page number would reside in the first page, \n\n*Format the text box by selecting the None option in the Arrange > Stay on Page > Text Wrap dropbox menu on the sidebar after clicking on the Format button in the Pages toolbar at the top right. This will make sure the text box remains in the first page and at the same location in the first page even if you add more content to your document,\n\n*You can fine-tune the box's location by selecting it and then changing the numbers in  the Position X-Y options in the Format > Arrange tab on the sidebar again.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Only an alternate solution: LaTeX + Emacs(editor) + Org-mode(package inside Emacs). An example in the picture below:\n\nPlease note the Contents can be removed if needed. Footer and page numbering is separate in LaTeX.\n", "Q: Macos resets screen refresh rate after disconnect I have 4 external monitors (non-mac) with MacBoook 16\". 2 of them (C27JG5x and Optix G24C support 144GhZ.) I have a few issues with that.\n\n*\n\n*Apple Displays settings doesn't have an option to change the refresh rate.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I found an external program Display Menu that can do it.\n\n\nUnfortunately, each time I unplug displays (or Reboot/put my Mac to sleep) the Refresh Rate setting resets to 60Ghz, however, macOS stills remember the Display arrangement and their resolutions.\nIs there any way that Macbook would use the previous refresh rate settings as well?\n\nA: Choose Scaled, but hold down the Option key when you click on it. You'll get a list of supported resolutions.  If you find your Monitors do this often, try using an EDID emulator on your external monitors.  (note: non-affiliate link)\n", "Q: Start/stop external hard drive? I need to start/stop an external hard drive (USB) from a shell or python script. Actually the external hard drive automatically stops when ejected. So, is it possible to programmatically eject / start an external hard drive? Something like USBDeview does for Windows :-)\nUpdate:\nMy intended use case: I want to run a nightly backup to the external drive. As the drive is quite loud and to save on energy, I only want it to be active during the backup. I likely won't use Time Machine, but my own backup script.\n\nA: You could use pmset disksleep TIME to set a timeout for the disk to go into standby mode. This way, you wouldn't have to mount/unmount the disk every time you want to access it. TIME is the time in minutes.\nIf you set the time to 0, the timeout is disabled, so if you want to keep it spinning you can set it to that.\n", "Q: What happens if I plug a power delivery dock to my Mac Mini? I need to use a dock for two displays from my MacBook and Mac Mini. The issue is the constant plugging and unplugging.\nI am considering getting the Kensington SD2400T Thunderbolt 3 Docking station for use both with the Mac Mini and the MacBook.\nMy question is, will this damage the Mac Mini? Does Thunderbolt successfully ignore the power delivery option when not needed.\n\nA: This will not damage the Mac mini. Thunderbolt chips negotiate the data protocols and the power delivery before delivering any power to any of the two devices. So the mac won't deliver power to the dock and the dock won't deliver any power to the mac.\n", "Q: Invert color in Preview I used command+option+control+8 to invert the colors on an image. When I open the image in Preview then try to print it, the image does not print with the colors inverted.  \nIs there another way for me to do this?\n\nA: The Command Option CTRL 8 keypress inverts the video signal of the display. It does not alter the 'true' colour properties of images, nor does it affect printing.\nYou can effect an inverse colour transformation to an image in Preview, using the method described here:\nhttps://osxdaily.com/2019/07/27/how-invert-image-mac-preview/\nEssentially, this involves switching the position of the Black point and White point sliders in the Adjust Colors panel.\n", "Q: iOS: can one pause a screen recording for continuing it later? Can one pause a screen recording and then continue it? There is a related question for macOS. My question is for the default screen-recording of iOS 13. If the answer is negative, is there some free apps which are able to do it?\n\nA: I have not heard of any way to do that, nor any 3rd-party app that can do it.\nYour best bet would be to find an app (or Shortcut, possibly) which can merge multiple videos together, and then you could run that after taking 2 or more.\n", "Q: Password Protect AirPrint I was recently hired as an IT supporter on a school for kids with autism and other development issues. They utilize iPads and I have no experience with Apple products.\nNow, today a teacher came to me asking if I could block access to the printers from the kids iPads. They are printing some rather unfortunate things, and from a brief googling, I couldn't seem to find any option to do so, apart from setting up a seperate network (not a possibility (the teachers use iPads as well, and they need to be able to print. All tablets are connected to the same network.))\nIs there a way to do it from the iPad, or do I have to setup passwords on the printers? \n\nA: You have multiple ways of blocking the kids from accessing the printers:\nDepending on the make and model of the printer, you could setup authentication on the printer. This way users will have to enter the username and password for the printer the first time they AirPrint something. This has to be done on the printer.\nDepending on the make and model of your network equipment, you can set up a seperate network for the kids's iPads that is not allowed to AirPrint (i.e. has no network access to the printers). Even though the teachers are also using iPads, this can work, as you would still have the ordinary WIFi where the teacher's iPad can connect to access the printers.\nFinally, as you indicate you prefer a solution where the restriction is done from the iPad, you can change the setup of the kids' iPads so that they're not allowed to AirPrint at all. \nThis can be done from a MDM setup, if you have one already. You can then specifically select a number of iPads, and then restrict access to AirPrint. \nIf you haven't got MDM, you can install \"Apple Configurator 2\" (free download from the App Store) on a Mac, and connect each iPad to set them up as supervised and block access to AirPrint. Note that usually iPads will be wiped when adding them as supervised devices.\nYou can find the user guide for \"Apple Configurator 2\" here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-configurator-2/welcome/mac\n\nA: There's a much easier way to handle this...use a \"Print Portal\" like SavaPage (FOSS).  There are other excellent commercial products (Xerox makes one) that will get the job done (with a cost of course)\nThe issues that you have is a diverse set of printers, users and permissions.  You could go through the trouble of setting up individual printers and permissions for each user and device, or you could have a centralized repository for your printing needs. \n\n\n*\n\n*Print to pool, not to a printer.  You might have several printers of different makes/models, but instead of setting up each one individually, you print to the pool where all the configuration is already done.  The server software handles the drivers for you.\n\n*Pull to Print.  This is one of my favorite features.  Instead of users printing and forgetting their print job in which they then reprint it (probably many times over) the user will send the job to the server (pool) where it \"waits\" for the user to request it from the printer.  We used key fobs with a compliment of Xerox printers located around the school.  When the teacher was ready to print, they went to the closest printer, authenticated with a key fob and selected their job.  It cut down on waste by 87% (I won a \"going green award for it).\n\n*Authentication.  This will solve your \"who is authorized to print problem.\"  We used existing Active Directory Credentials along with the key fob that allowed users to print or not to print.  Unauthorized attempts were logged and emails sent to division directors/teachers\n\n*Accounting  This is probably overkill for what you need, but the feature is there. With this type of software you can assign costs (i.e. $0.0045 per B&W page, $0.02 per color) or raw number of pages (i.e. 1000 double sided pages).  Along with charging back departments for their printing needs, we could also allow students to print by having a \"printing account\" that would get debited as they used it.\nWindows Server had rudimentary printer pooling built in and it worked really well - it might be something you want to look at.  However, approaching this from a Printer Portal perspective gives you the flexibility to use printers that don't support AirPrint, don't have the authentication built in or has whatever idiosyncrasies that make setting them up difficult.\n", "Q: File duplication takes no disk space! I have a question that's probably not asked too often, because it has little negative impact on the user. I can't find it on The Google anyway.\nSo this question is for the edification of the curious-minded.\nIn my production environment I manually backup often. I have noticed that when simply duplicating files, they don't take up as much space as they used to in older versions of MacOSX.\nAs an experiment (because I am a nerd) I attempted to fill my hard drive by copying large files.

Clones take very little space. Only when a clone is modified, is significant additional space required.\n\nClones\nClones allow the operating system to make efficient file copies on the same volume without occupying additional storage space. Changes to a cloned file are saved as delta extents, reducing storage space required for document revisions and copies.[9] There is, however, no interface to mark two copies of the same file as clones of the other, or for other types of data deduplication.\n\nSee also iMore's Apple File System (APFS): What you need to know.\nTo understand how APFS works, see the Apple File System Reference.\n", "Q: My Mail app (MacOS Catalina 10.15.3) displays phantom unread messages My MacBook displays 1 unread message in smart mailbox while there are none. \nIt used to work OK, but recently it shows unread messages. When I click on this Smart Mailbox it doesn't display any messages. Settings for the Smart Mailbox is OK. I tried methods described in different topics but it doesn't seem to work. Any ideas?

Very unexpected form Apple!\nSolution\nRe-installed macOS Mojave (I decided not to update to macOS Catalina at any cost)! Here is the screenshot from macOS Mojave with ambient noise reduction option. \n\n\nA: My understanding is that the \"Ambient Noise Reduction\" feature only works with the internal microphone. Thus when you plug-in a Røde USB microphone, ambient noise reduction is not applied to that input. Therefore I suggest looking at other possible causes of bad audio quality or latency.\nThe lack of the checkbox for the internal microphone on Catalina is, as I understand it, a bug. Hopefully Apple will restore it in a point update.\nUnfortunately there doesn't seem to be a Terminal command that enables/disables ambient noise reduction. You might however want to check if the plists in the /Library/Preferences/Audio/ folder contains a setting related to ambient noise reduction on your system.\nHowever Apple's documentation seem to indicate that you can disable ambient noise reduction by setting up a 4-channel built-in microphone format with the Audio MIDI Setup program.\n", "Q: How can one save iTerm2 hotkey-window settings (size/dimensions, computer monitor/display, and relative display position)?

When I change the Style setting back to a Full-Width setting, it gets wonky again, namely it starts stretching the Hotkey Window to a full width of the screen. Makes sense.\nWhat makes less sense to me is why Full-Width was set for this Hotkey-Window profile which I had not used previously. This suggests it might (?) be a default setting. If so, I'm not sure why the iTerm2 developers/managers want it this way, it seems like it would cause confusion for other newbies like me in the same scenario. \n\n", "Q: Using Node.js without admin rights - sh: node: command not found I've been following this guide (https://theshravan.net/blog/how-to-use-node-and-npm-without-installation-or-admin-rights/) to try to use Node.js on my work computer.

I have two pre-teen children who would like to do the following things with an iOS device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Control Sonos speakers\n\n*Spotify\n\n*iMessage\n\n\nHowever, we don't want to sit behind them and supervise every moment of their tablet usage so we need a tablet that can't add apps from the app store and does not have a general purpose web browser capable of seeing any site on the Internet.\nAt first, \"Guided Access\" seems like a good solution.  However, it is trivially easy to break out of guided access and gain access to Safari, etc.  My children will most certainly, and quickly, figure this out.\n\"Single App Mode\" is robust, and can't be broken out of, and behaves just like what we need - but it is, literally, single app mode.  You can't have sonos and spotify and imessage available - you can only pick one.\nSo I am at a loss ...\nAssuming that I have smart kids that can look up things on their school computers and figure out how to break out of the jail and assuming that I would like an iOS device that has only a limited set of apps and no ability to add new ones, what is a good strategy ?\nIs it possible to remove apps (like Safari) from an iOS device, then lock down the app store, and make it impossible to add new ones ?  In this instance, they could still factory reset the entire thing and get a fresh iOS device with Safari and Internet access, correct ?\nOpen to any suggestions ...\n\nA: You can use \"Apple Configurator 2\" from the App Store to supervise the device. Note that supervising the iOS device will wipe its current content.\nWhen you have supervised the device, you can setup restrictions such as for example disabling the Safari web browser, disabling app installation from the App Store, etc.\nAnother approach might be to make an agreement with your children so that they know what they're allowed and not allowed to do, and then trust them to not install other apps. If they do, you can have a productive conversation on that topic - perhaps they can convince you that the new app is actually a benefit to them...\n", "Q: How to add colors for Charts in Numbers v6 Numbers 6.2.1 limits you to six colors for a Chart, which is a problem when creating a donut chart with more than six segments.

USD) to buy in app purchases that reward me with virtual currency - let's say \"gold.\"\nBut is the opposite true? As a developer, can I allow my users to sell their gold back to me for a USD reward?\nIn particular, the following bullet point:\n\nApps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to “tip” digital content providers in the app.\n\nSeems to hint at that kind of transaction, but I don't know if my scenario falls under that description.\nFor a full scenario, consider the following:\nAlice writes a blog post. She wants to put a paywall on it so she gets paid a small amount before anyone can read it. Alice charges 50 gold for anyone to read her blog post.\nBob sees her blog post on his feed. He goes to the in app store to purchase some gold, let's say 100 for $1.99. He then spends 50 gold to unlock the blog post.\nAlice receives 50 gold from 30 different people, netting her 1500 gold. She then goes to my website and initiates a withdrawal. Alice makes, let's say, $10 from her 1500 gold and her balance is reset.\nCan an app that does this make it past App Store review? Is it totally legal or do I have to follow some other regulations in the U.S. (other than the usual PCI-DSS, etc)?\n\nA: I don't see anything in the guidelines that would prevent you from making such an app. However, it is always best to check with Apple as they are the ones making the final decision.\nThere's no need for you to actually implement this as \"buying back gold\". You can just let users buy an in-app purchase that is \"gold\", that they can use to tip the content providers.\nThen on your web site you can make a section where content providers can login to see how many times they have been tipped. This doesn't need to have anything to do with \"gold\" or in-app purchases or anything like that.\nAs you write that the withdrawal (payout) is made through your own web site, and not the app, this sounds perfectly doable.\nAs for legal issues, you need to contact a lawyer in your area. Laws are different in various countries, states, etc. and could depend on how you have incorporated, and other details.

If you don't have other user accounts, go ahead and create one to test the problem - you can always delete it later - to see if the problem occurs on this new account. If it doesn't occur, then this sounds like the permissions on your user account are all munged up and you need to try the first method below. If the problem occurs with other and/or new accounts, or recurs after trying the first step with your user account, then try the second method.\nThe first method is to attempt to fix the permissions on your own user folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Finder menu bar, choose Go > Home. Your home folder opens.\n\n*Choose File > Get Info. An Info window for your home folder opens.\n\n*If the Sharing & Permissions section at the bottom of the window isn't open, click the triangle  in that section to open it.\n\n*If the lock icon at the bottom of the window is 'locked', click the lock and enter an administrator name and password.\n\n*Click the action menu (Gear with downward arrow) then choose “Apply to enclosed items.” Click OK to confirm the action. \n\n\n\nThe 'Apply to all items' process may take quite a while, especially if your user account has many thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of files. Once it is finished, restart the Mac or logout from your account then login again.\n\nIf the first method does not fix your user folder permissions, then you need get more drastic, you need to reinstall macOS from macOS Recovery. Details about how to do that at the Apple Support page.\nLastly, if the macOS Recovery method does not work, you need to have a backup of your Mac, then erase the startup disk, reinstall macOS or restore from backup.\n\nMethods derived from this Apple Support page.\n", "Q: How do I remove an old NAS/FIle Server? First I am new to Mac after 20+ years of Windows so I admit I am struggling. I was an expert on Windows and seem to be lost on MAC.\nI have a Macbook pro with Catalina OS. I am trying to remove a bad entry for my Windows NAS server. It is listed under Finder ==> Network  I also notice is shows as a \"MAC\" not a server.\nWhat started this issue is that I cannot connect using the WINS/NetBios name but the IP works fine. SO I will just use the IP but want the name removed. Yes I am OCD\n\n\nA: The contents of the \"Network\" location is not something stored on your computer that you can delete. Instead it shows the current state of your network.\nThis means that you have a device that broadcasts its presence to the network letting you know that it is named DJM-NAS-1 via NetBIOS. You can get rid of it here by stopping that announcement on the NAS unit - and this is also where you can change the name of it. The icon is determined by the type of software used on the NAS unit.\n", "Q: Is there a user-friendly editor for Karabiner complex modifications? I have a large list of Karabiner complex modifications and it is hard to keep track of them all including conflicts, excluded applications, etc. From what I can tell the user is expected to edit ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json by hand. However this isn't practical at all, since each modification definition ends up being quite verbose and I can only see 1-2 per screen. Is there some more efficient method that I'm missing? Or should I just write my own program to generate the karabiner.json file?\n\nA: I found Goku (see answer by furins) and a few other tools but none seemed any easier than editing the JSON. In the end I wrote my own scripts which I'll share here.\nThere are two Python files:\n\n\n*\n\n*decompose.py takes a karabiner JSON and breaks it up into a many files and directories, so you can edit one rule at a time.\n\n*compose.py takes these directories and rolls them into a single JSON that karabiner will accept.\n\n\nI keep both the single JSON and the decomposed directories (as well as the script) in my dotfiles repo. When I want to alter a keybind, I create a directory for it (easiest method is to copy an existing one and modify) then do a roundtrip encode/decode. Eg.: python compose.py; python decompose.py; python compose.py.\nAfter this my first step is to check git diff to see if my new rule has some error that broke the whole thing. If so, I have many options to revert the changes via git and try again. When done, I test the keybind with Karabiner-EventViewer and its intended use case, and commit.\nThe scripts are obviously limited and hacky, because they are for personal use (and I think the \"proper\" solution to this would be to just not use a Mac, har har). I suggest starting with a known-working JSON such as PC-style shortcuts so you can see how the existing rules work. They do work reasonably well, but some caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Each rule goes into a directory. The directory name is built from a number (to keep the rules from changing order and confusing git) and the name of the rule. Obviously rule names can have special characters, but directories cannot, so there's some funny normalization I had to do with that. It can be a bit fragile if you do fancy things with the rule name.\n\n*I use PyCharm which has its own keyboard shortcut interceptor.

Can I get around this issue. Thanks, Rose\n\nA: Can I get round this issue?\nNot easily. This is 16-year-old software, and lots has changed since then, so that a modern OS can't run it.\nWhile it is possible to 'emulate' an older computing environment that could run the software, this is complicated.\nFurthermore, Word 2004 can't open most modern .docx files, which were introduced in 2007. So it wouldn't be very useful to you anyway.\nSoftware has a time to live, and a time to die. Either buy a new version of Office, compatible with your OS, or use a free Office 'clone' like LibreOffice. You can read and save Word files from Apple's Pages, too.\n\nA: You apparently have a very old version of Microsoft Office. You need to upgrade to a more recent version. There is an emulation program called SheepShaver that will do just what you want. The installation directions are given here. And the home page for Sheepshaver describes what the emulator does. An emulator, in this case, is a software package that will act like a PowerPC system so you can run PowerPC codes.

But in doing so, you risk damaging your device's screen.\n\"These phones have a coating on them to prevent oil or grease from your hand from sticking on the phone,\" Jason Siciliano, vice president and global creative director of smartphone protection service SquareTrade, told Business Insider. \"Using alcohol or or those types of everyday solutions directly on a phone, on its glass, can harm it.\"\n\nSo what can you do to protect yourself when using your electronic device?\n\nIf you're looking for an alternative method of killing germs, you can try looking into a UV phone sanitizer like Phone Soap, which uses UV-C light to break down germs and bacteria. It's a relatively small box that almost resembles a tanning bed for your phone that blasts it with UV-C light to disinfect it.\nAlthough you shouldn't use cleaning products on your mobile device, you may be able to do so on its case, depending on the materials it's made from.\n\n\n\nA: The simplest answer, I suppose, would be to buy a case for your iPhone, or at least one of those protective screen-shields, and then clean that. That way you can disinfect the phone without damaging the screen, and if you happen to damage the case or shield... It you can replace.\n\nA: Apple has recently published an update to their support document, How to clean your Apple products.

On a Mac, how useful is this and in what situation(s) should we enable it?\n$ locate 'node_modules'\n\nWARNING: The locate database (/var/db/locate.database) does not exist.\nTo create the database, run the following command:\n\n  sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist\n\nPlease be aware that the database can take some time to generate; once\nthe database has been created, this message will no longer appear.\n\n\nA: Once created, according to the man page for locate, the database is updated, automatically, every day or week. I suppose it's one of the daily/weekly scripts that run automatically and that can be forced to run by the app OnyX.  As to the difference between find and locate; since locate is said to be a \"find filenames quickly\" command, I suppose find doesn't use the database. So I'd create the database at your earliest convenience and then it'll get updated automatically in the background. \n", "Q: I want to install Windows 10 on External SSD and then be able to move it between 2 Macs, is that possible? I have two newish Macs: a 2018 Mac Mini and a 2017 MacBook Pro, both running Catalina. I have purchased a 500GB SanDisk Extremest Pro (supposed read/write of 10GBs/s) to install Windows 10 from Bootcamp on. I haven't done this part yet but we'll see, it doesn't seem as easy as it should be. \nAnyway, I would like to be able to move the Windows-installed SSD between the two computers freely and then be able to boot into it on wither machine. IS that possible? I would think that I'd just have to have and install the drivers from Bootcamp Assistant on each machine into that one Windows OS but really I have no idea. Would windows know which drivers to use dependent on which machine it's connected too?\nAny help or insight on either process (install Win10 on SSD and Use SSD on Two Macs) is GREATLY appreciated.\n(FWIW I'm trying to set up virtual reality gaming via Oculus Link on either computer, along with a Razer Core eGPU running an AMD Radeon 580. Installing the driver for that GPU is a whole different issue I'll be tackling after this one.)\n\nA: While technically possible, it would be exceedingly cumbersome because each time you booted, Windows would consider itself to be running on new hardware and require a new activation and new device driver installations. See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change.\nA better option is virtualization. You can run vmware, parallels, or the free https://www.virtualbox.org, installed on each of your macs, and keep the virtualmachine file on the external drive.\n\nA: Yes it is certainly possible - I do it and have no issue with either drivers or activation.  The external install works on all my Macs with the exception of a 2006 MacbookPro2,1 which will not boot anything apart from OS X from an external drive.\nYou don't need to do anything special - once you have a bootable drive just plug it into another Mac/PC and it will generally work - Windows is very forgiving about hardware when it comes to booting these days.\nNote that Windows 10 activation is tied to the Mac/PC hardware that you boot it from not the installation on the external disk.  All my Macs have digital licenses for Windows so my external Windows activates whichever I boot it on.  If you boot on a Mac/PC without a digital license for that edition of Windows then it will run un-activated until you either buy a license or boot from a Mac/PC with a license.\n\nInstallation\nThis question isn't really Mac specific but the first step is to install Windows to the external drive as normal.  There are many methods and guides to do this. I did it manually as I already had other OSs on my external drive and I find it quicker. \nThe Microsoft recommended partition layout is described here but it doesn't much matter as long as you have a EFI partition and a Microsoft basic data partition.  I partitioned the external drive using gdisk like this using the existing EFI partition (number 1) for Windows boot files and then created partition 4 for Windows as that is where I had space.\nPS C:\\Users\\Hali\\Downloads\\gdisk-windows-1.0.5> .\\gdisk64.exe 1:\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.5\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.\n\nCommand (? for help): p\nDisk 1:: 488397168 sectors, 232.9 GiB\nSector size (logical): 512 bytes\nDisk identifier (GUID): 1EE267FB-E2ED-4704-8B4A-635AA0134B7D\nPartition table holds up to 128 entries\nMain partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 33\nFirst usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 488397134\nPartitions will be aligned on 8-sector boundaries\nTotal free space is 1698070 sectors (829.1 MiB)\n\nNumber  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name\n   1            2048          411647   200.0 MiB   EF00  ESP\n   2          411648       149356231   71.0 GiB    AF00  SamsungHFS\n   3       149618688       247205343   46.5 GiB    AF0A  Mojave\n   4       247205344       413563199   79.3 GiB    0700  SamsungNTFS\n   5       413563200       465992007   25.0 GiB    0700  exFAT\n   6       465992008       486963534   10.0 GiB    8300  LinuxBackup\n\nCommand (? for help):\n\nNext Windows was applied from the ISO to the NTFS partition using DISM and the Windows bootloader to (external drive) EFI partition using bcdboot.  This was done from Windows running on my internal Boot Camp partition.  The Microsoft steps for doing this are here or you can look at this tutorial. You may then want to apply Boot Camp drivers at this point as your Macs are recent but I installed them after first boot. \nIf you don't have a Boot Camp partition you could use a separate Windows PC to do it or install Windows on VirtualBox, mount the external disk as a raw disk and then apply from there or use some other method as described in the links above.\nOnce you've installed Windows to your external drive (however you did it) you can then boot from it.  \n\nInitial activation\nIf you installed Windows 10 the activation is normally stored as a digital license tied to the hardware - it is not tied to the installation.  Therefore if your Boot Camp partition has a valid license then the first time you boot from Windows on your external drive it will activate as soon as you connect to internet.  If your Mac doesn't have a license then it will run un-activated indefinitely with some limitations.  This is exactly the same way as activation works when dual booting on any PC.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows running from SamsungNTFS partition on external SSD on a 2013 i5 MBP.\n\n\n\n\nDrivers\nIf you want to boot from another Mac just hold option and pick EFI boot on the external drive.\n\nWhen booting a different Mac/PC you'll see a message \"Getting devices ready..\" during boot but this takes only a few seconds and you don't need to manually install drivers - it is automatic.

If it doesn't (for me about 10% of the time I swap it doesn't) you'll see this message:\n\nIf you click on \"Troubleshoot\" and the hardware you are booting on has a valid digital license it will then activate.\n \n", "Q: Issues with Mail.app AppleScript scripts I'm trying to get a simple AppleScript to run from a rule in Mail.app under Catalina.

So if the script runs it trys to read the contend from the mails from a certain disk location but the rule action from Apple Mail is moving the mail away simultaneously. So the script fails to read the mails. You can't even use a simple set mySubject to subject of theMessage because even this simple access will try to read the mail contend from disk.\nThe only solution at the moment is to set up a rule who only execute the applescript (or may be make simple tasks like setting a tag) and try to sorting/moving the mails to its new locations in the script itself; which will make the script more complex and heavy to maintain...\nI don't know if this should be filed as bug to Apple or if this is intended behavior.\nhope this helps a bit\n", "Q: Why does the Terminal tab keep popping up on my MacBook Pro when I try to shut it down?

My local Mail-Archive consists of about 130'000 E-Mails from multiple accounts, stored in hundreds of folders, localy on one of my Macs. The archive goes back 18 Years! The oldest E-Mails are from 2002!\nNow I finally want to have all of them available all the time from everywhere on every device I own. Therefore I want to migrate those thousands of emails to my IMAP-Accounts (3x GMail, 1x iCloud, 1x private Server; I have multiple accounts 'cause of work, honorary activity, personal etc).\nWhats the most efficient way to migrate such a large local archive to a single IMAP-Account? (or if possible even better: multiple Accounts?)\nSome notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's OK if I loose the structure of the current local archive (The folder hierarchy)\n\n*Since many of the (older) messages are from E-Mail-Accounts not longer active or existing (f.e. old @yahoo.com Mails), it's OK if I have to move many of them to a IMAP-mailbox in another Account (f.e. to my current iCloud-Account)\n\n*If there is no easy way to split the local Archive and move some messages to Account X and others to Account Y, it's OK if I have to move all Mails to just one IMAP-Account (yet: Gmail, iCloud, private … which should I choose? Size of Storage is no problem on all accounts ;-) )\n\n\nI thought about creating a new Smart Mailbox and filter the whole local archive for all E-Mails of OldAccount001, then move them by hand (drag-and-drop) to the «Archive»-Mailbox of my CurrentAccount001 … then edit the Smart Mailbox to filter the whole local archive for all E-Mails of OldAccount002 and move them to the «Archive»-Mailbox of my CurrentAccount002 et cetera parge parge … this way I sure loose all the structure (folder hierarchy), but I can live with that … but will this actually work? Again: I'm speaking about thousands of locally stored E-Mails, some 18 years old, many of them from accounts no longer existing – of course many of them with Attachments etc.\n\nA: \nWhats the most efficient way to migrate such a large local archive to a single IMAP-Account?\n\nUnfortunately, the most efficient way to do this is to migrate from one IMAP server to another.  I say unfortunately, because this is something that happens at the server level and not via the user.  \nIn all of the migrations I've been involved with (all from something to Exchange), we kept migration to a minimum and archived everything.  That archive remained \"online\" for reference only (it didn't accept new mail) and new folders couldn't be created.  After a number of years (3, I believe) it went to permanent archive in which we took it offline and only went to it if there was reason to do so (like legal subpoena).\nIn the end, migration was simply too costly (time, labor, efficiency, dollars) so it's rarely done.\nIn your case, unless you have access to the back end of the servers, your service providers are not likely at all to accommodate the request.  So, unfortunately, getting those mails over to your new server is going to be a manual process.\nWith all that said, my recommendation is to move away from the (dated) IMAP severs and look at Exchange.  It's the gold standard.  You can get a hosted Exchange account from Microsoft for $8 per user per month and it's a much better solution than pretty much anything else offered.\n\nA: I've had success by first organizing the mail into local \"On My Mac\" mailboxes in Apple Mail, then exporting those mailboxes using the Mailbox > Export Mailbox menu item. This creates a folder containing a standard .mbox file. Finally, this python script, IMAP Upload, can upload the contents of the mbox file to an IMAP server.\n", "Q: Can I reinstall macOS on my Mac after it's been turned into a Linux box?

Both operation systems store some of their boot files in the EFI/Boot folder. This causes a conflict which can result in either or both operation systems not appearing in or not booting from the Mac Startup Manager.\nOne possible solution would be to have two EFI partitions. It does not really matter when you create the second EFI partition. However, the second EFI has to exist by step 4 below. Here I will assume the second EFI partition exists at the end the drive (disk0s7).\n\n\n*\n\n*Install macOS.\n\n*Install Windows. Windows will put its boot files in the first EFI partition (disk0s1).\n\n*Install Ubuntu. Ubuntu will put its boot files in the first EFI partition (disk0s1). Some of the Windows boot files will be overwritten.\n\n*Add the Windows boot files to the second EFI partition. The steps are given below.\nBoot from the Windows installation flash drive. Enter shift+F10 to open a Command Prompt window. Enter the following commands. Here I assume windows is installed to drive C: and partition 7 contains the second EFI volume.

This is the docker I'm using\nWhat I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Bootcamp (works excellent, I can see the two screens how it should be)\n\n*General info\n\n*Updates (there are none, it's up to date)\n\n*Reset NVRAM\n\n*Pressing Option -> \"Detect Displays\" on bottom right corner\n\n\nLook below:\n\nThat's with the lid open, if I close it, it only shows me this:\n\nNow what I wonder is why are those two profiles there? Is it recognizing the other monitor but not doing anything?\nEDIT: the profile doesn't seem to be involved in this, still not 100% sure\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Not sure if this would work for you, but my MacBook Pro was not detecting a Dell 2nd screen while my buddy's older MacBook Pro did.\nAll I had to do was reseat the cable on the monitors side - the pins were a bit loose and I just tightened them all the screws all the way.\n\nA: The problem was that mac doesn't allow to plug in multiple monitors using the same port. I was using a dongle to connect 2 monitors.\nSolution:\nMonitors need to be pluged-in in different ports.\n", "Q: how do I get my iPhone contacts onto my new MacBook Pro, so that I can send iMessages from my computer, instead of my phone? I just bought another MacBook Pro and I want to send and receive text messages from my mac instead of my iPhone. How do I get my MacBook Pro to sync with my iPhone as it used to on my old MacBook?\n\nA: You will need to use the same iCloud device on both, and allow Messages in the cloud on both devices. On your iPhone, go to Settings > Tap your name at the top > iCloud. Make sure, both Contacts and Messages are enabled. \nThen go back to iMessage on the Mac and go through the configuration there. You may need to open iMessage preferences, then go to the iMessage tab and check most of the boxes there. \n", "Q: How to move app bundles safely on the command line I need to copy/move a bunch of macOS apps from some directory locations to another location. I know I can do this safely via the Finder. (By \"safely\" I mean that the app still starts up and works after copying/moving.)\nHowever I would like to do this via the command line. Can I just use cp and mv like this:\n$ cp -pr /path/to/old-location/myapp.app /path/to/new-location\n\n$ mv /path/to/old-location/myapp.app /path/to/new-location\n\nWhat about resource forks of files in the bundle? Or do other considerations warranting a better command line tool for copying/moving apps safely?\nI am using macOS 10.13, High Sierra, in this particular case, but of course I'd be interested in a solution independent of the macOS version.\n\nA: The copying of files on the Mac command line is a curious thing. \nIf both the source and the destination are on HFS, HFS+ or APFS file systems then cp will preserve special macOS attributes and since fairly early versions of macOS all extended attributes.\nIf you want to be slightly more secure you can use the -a option to cp which preserves absolutely everything including modification time, access time, file flags, file mode, user ID, and group ID, as allowed by permissions.  Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Extended Attributes (EAs), including resource forks, will also be preserved. It also copies, rather than follows, symbolic links. Personally, this is what I use for copying apps.\nFor a total guarantee, including copying to other file systems such as FAT or NTFS you should use ditto —-rsrc which saves all the neat stuff in .AppleDouble files on those file systems.\nIf you want more information I heartily recommend a close reading of the man page of both.\nmv is safe as houses so long as you are on the same volume and fine if both source and destination volumes are macOS formats.\nBy the way, you mistyped your example. It should be cp -pR, which is essentially the same as cp -a.\n\nA: Yes, in my experience there has been no problem either moving or copying applications, even from one drive to another, using the regular cp and mv tools.\n", "Q: Edge swipe gesture for opening Notification Center on macOS stopped working Recently the edge swipe gesture for opening Notification Center stopped working on my MacBook Pro. It happened around the same time I upgraded to Catalina, but not sure if it's related. I also confirmed the setting is still enabled (screenshot below). It works fine if I click the button on the top right. Any ideas on how to resolve?

Why it is backup first in the above article.\nDo I have to booted into single user to delete IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext? Can I just delete it within a normal login?\nP.S. Can anybody help me add the kernel_task tag? I don't have the permission to do so.\n\nA: You do not actually want to remove the IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext - that is a really bad idea.\nWhen you see kernel_task seemingly (!) eat a lot of CPU, it actually means that the operating system is throttling CPU usage to prevent the system from shutting down unexpectedly. This happens when you have a problem with the cooling solution in your computer.\nYou want to ensure that fans are operating properly, vents are not blocked, thermal paste is still OK, etc.\nIf your cooling solution is OK and this problem persists, you might have a problem with the temperature sensors or the main board itself.\n", "Q: Automating screenshot workflow I am looking for a way to launch Preview on my Mac automatically, whenever I take a screenshot to my clipboard. I use \"cmd + shift + 4\" most of the times, then open preview, then hit \"cmd+n\" which accomplishes what I'm after, but is just time-consuming.\nI have looked around but haven't found an option to do this with Automator. I'm not sure if it's even possible that Automator 'monitors' the clipboard and whenever it receives a screenshot, could trigger Preview.\nAny help is much appreciated! \n\nA: If you open /System/Applications/Utilities/Screenshot.app, you will be given the option to choose where your screenshot goes.    You can select for the screenshot to automatically open in Preview.\n\nNow anytime you use your keyboard shortcuts to take a screenshot,  the default action would be to open the screenshot in Preview.\n\n", "Q: how do I get 1080p resolution when screen recording an iPad Pro? I have an iPad Pro 10.5 inch with an advertised resolution of \"2224 × 1668 px\".  However, when I do a screen recording using Quicktime Player of the iPad, I get a much lower resolution.  How do I get at least a 1080p resolution?\n\nA: Instead of recording using QuickTime via a Lightning to USB cable, which for the 10.5\" iPad Pro records at a fixed, non-adjustable 1600x1200 resolution, you can mirror your screen to an Apple TV via AirPlay, which is a 1080p output.\nBut instead of having the Apple TV connected to a TV, connect it to an HDMI capture device connected to your Mac, such as the Epiphan AV.io HD. From there you can use QuickTime and choose the HDMI capture device as the source for screen recording.\nNote that you may have to go into System Preferences to change a setting to make it work. Also, because the iPad has a 4:3 display aspect ratio, you will get pillarboxing on anything that's not native 16:9 content (such as the home screen), making the image equivalent to 1440x1080; lower than recording the iPad directly using QuickTime. But still technically 1080p, as it refers to the vertical resolution of the output.\nThere is no known way of recording the iPad's screen at its native 2224×1668 resolution. Apple's Lightning to Digital AV Adapter tops out at 900p (1600x900 upscaled to 1080p, looks yucky), and AirPlay mirroring tops out at 1080p.\n\nA: Try going into Settings → Camera → Record Video.  On my iPad, I have the option of choosing  720p or 1080p.  It was defaulted to 720p\n", "Q: Very large (out of core) image viewer for Mac? (Yes, I've seen this question, but what that poster considered  \"truly massive\" is pretty ordinary now.)\nCan anyone suggest an image viewer on the Mac, OSS or commercial, that is capable of displaying TIFF images in the multi-gigabyte range? Ideally something capable of out-of-core viewing, i.e., for images beyond the limits of physical RAM.\nI've tried Preview.app (not so much...), ImageMagick (hangs), Adobe Photoshop (worked great on a 25 GB, 8-bit grayscale tiff, 180k x 280k res, on a 16 GB RAM machine, but has a hard resolution limit at 300k in either resolution), and Graphic Converter (did well on a 1.5 GB image, but crashed on an 8 GB one [Edit: developer fixed this immediately upon my reporting it], but cannot open the 25 GB image).\nI'm familiar with the old VLIV on Windows. Anything modern like this for Mac? It doesn't need to be a GUI app, and I have minimal requirements other than that it can actually display the images correctly.\n\nA: I am also looking for the answer to this.\nI tried Xee, as recommended on the linked post, but it could not open the 2.43 GB ~1.8 billion pixel image from NASA's Curiosity rover (88797 x 22958 pixels TIFF image)\nI have also tried Phiewer and ApolloOne, but they did not work for me either.\nXNViewMP worked for me, but opened the file slowly, and basically freezes when I try to interact with the picture.\n", "Q: How to mirror ipad on mac catalina I have a MacBook Pro with macOS Catalina version 10.15.3 and an iPad mini with iOS 13.3.1.\nI'd like to mirror the iPad to MacBook Pro.\nI can extend the iPad using Sidecar but not the other way around.\nHow can I do it? \n\nA: You can use the macOS built-in QuickTime Player app to mirror the display of any iPad device. You'd need to connect the iPad to your Mac using a cable for this to work.\nStart by connecting your iPad to your Mac, launch QuickTime Player.app, and in the QuickTime Player menu bar, go to File → New Movie Recording (or alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut, Option + Command + N).\nThis would open a QuickTime player window and activate the MacBook's built-in FaceTime camera. Now in the QuickTime Player window, click on the arrow shown besides the red colored record button, and under Camera, select your iPad.\n\nThis would change the contents of the window to display the iPad's screen instead of feed from the FaceTime camera. (Make sure that the iPad is not in sleep mode).\n\nYou are all set. You need not actually press the record button (which would simply start recording the iPad's screen). This way you have the iPad screen contents mirrored on your Mac.\n\nA: There are also a bunch of 3rd party tools with more advance options that can be used to mirror iPad's screen on a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*AirServer\n\n*Reflector 3 \n\n*ApowerMirror \n", "Q: Conversion of a 2011 vintage Unibody Macbook Pro to Linux I've got a Late 2011 17\" MacBook Pro that got as far as High Sierra 10.13.6. My thought was to remove the SSD that's currently installed, replace it with another SSD, then install Linux Mint on this new SSD. \nI'd like to be able to restore High Sierra if Linux Mint doesn't work out. Swapping SSDs is easy enough, but I want to avoid burning any bridges. Are there any NVRAM/firmware/other issues I should watch for... that is to say any changes that could render my machine un-bootable should I ever wish to return to High Sierra?\n\nA: There's nothing in NVRAM or in the EFI firmware that make your 2011 MacBook Pro unbootable should you ever want to return to a previous macOS.\nAs I explained in another answer, NVRAM holds your preboot environment like boot volume.  The worst thing that will happen is it will look for a bootable file where one no longer exists resulting in the infamous flashing question mark or prohibitory sign.  Reinstallation of your OS will fix the problem.\nAs far as your EFI goes, it's equivalent to your BIOS, just much more advanced.  There's nothing an OS installation is going to do that irreparably harms your EFI firmware.  \nDoing installations on separate SSDs is actually a good idea.  I do that myself as SSD prices are now very low that it's more economical (in time) to just swap out a drive than it it is to format and install.  The Macs (of varying vintages and models) don't complain at all.  NVRAM is never reset or variables modified for any reason.\nNow, for applicable models with the T2 Security Chip (the 2011 MBP is not), users have to be aware of Secure Boot.  Basically, it will prevent unsigned operating systems from being installed or booted.  However, that restriction can be turned off.  It's basically the same thing as UFEI Secure Boot found on PCs.\n", "Q: Firewall setup for Python.app incoming connection I am running a Python programme on my MacBook Pro (Catalina), but everytime it prompts the following information\n\nHowever, in the pane of Security & Privacy preferences, I have set it,\n\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: Create a self-signed certificate.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain Access.

One that can be configured as a repeater, which will connect to the iPhone's wifi access point, and another that will just treat the first router as \"the internet\":\nInternet --(3G/4G)--> iPhone --(Wifi)--> Router 1 in repeater mode --(Ethernet)-->[WAN socket] Router 2 ==(Ethernet, Wifi)==> Additional devices\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to your iPhone's wifi as usual with your computer, and write down the gateway address and subnet mask that your computer's wifi connection gets assigned (e.g. in advanced wifi settings on macOS). In my case it was 172.20.10.1/255.255.255.240 -- the iPhone's own address.\n\n\n*Configure router 1 as a repeater, which includes providing it the iPhone's wifi name and password that it should use to connect, as well as the IP address and subnetmask it should use on the iPhone's own wifi network. My subnet mask ends in 240 meaning I can choose from addresses 172.20.10.0-172.20.10.15. After excluding the special case 15 I chose 172.20.10.14 so as to minimize the chance of a collision with addresses that the iPhone might assign to new devices on the network.\nThe iPhone's shared network should now be extended to router 1's ethernet ports, with the iPhone acting as the DHCP server and gateway.\n\n\n*Since the network on router 1 now depends on the iPhone for dynamic assignment of addresses, I needed another router in order to create a stable LAN if I want to avoid having to manually configure the address of every single device in the network when the iPhone is not connected. Router 2 just operates as usual, creating its own LAN and providing DHCP on it.\nThe iPhone will act as the ISP and assign router 2 an \"external\" IP (in my case 172.20.10.10) as soon as router 1 connects to the WAN socket of router 2.\n", "Q: \"SecurID\" will damage your computer? Today I've just started getting a warning dialog when I try to run the RSA SecurID app:\n\nThis is a Java app I believe. I use it to authenticate when I connect to my company's private network. I've been running Catalina (10.15.3) for some time but this has only just started happening today (after a reboot, FWIW).\nUnlike previous Gatekeeper interventions there doesn't seem to be any obvious way to circumvent this warning and run the app, which is problematic as I can't work remotely without it.\nUPDATE: \nAs suggested in the comments below, I downloaded and installed SecurID 4.2.1, and I now get a similar error message:\n\n\nA: I had this same issue come up today - there must be some definition added to these scanners that's picking up the SecurID app. On one laptop, I was able to resolve it with just step 2 and 3 below but on another, I had to do the first as well. Since you're getting the stauto32.framework error, you'll probably need both steps like I did.\nStep 1 - Delete the existing stauto32.framework folder - found  at /Library/Frameworks/stauto32.framework\nStep 2 - Download and run the 4.2.1 installer for the software token from RSA to upgrade or ensure the right things are all installed where they should be\nStep 3 - open the info panel of the SecurID application in the Applications folder and check the 'Override Malware Protection' box\nAfter that, when you run the app, it will ask for your password to access its various pieces stores in the Keychain and will also request access to a couple disk folders used in importing new tokens.\nI hope that works for you as it did in our case!\n", "Q: How to resolve Bootcamp failed installation error I'm getting exactly the same error as this person.\nThat is, bootcamp could not install Windows files (it occurred just after the partitioning was completed). \nI'm using a Macbook Air 2015 120Gb, on MacOS Sierra and I allocated 50 GB to the bootcamp partition (bootable USB not needed apparently.) The fix mentioned in the video (ISO converter) seems to be no longer supported. I also read somewhere that disabling FileVault can help, or picking a smaller ISO file but there is only one version on the Microsoft site currently (November 2019 update.)\nIs someone familiar with this problem and has a solution?\n\nA: The Boot Camp Assistant attempts to create a temporary internal FAT32 formatted volume containing the files from the Windows 10 ISO and the Windows Support Software downloaded from the internet. However, since the ISO contains a file named install.wim in the sources directory which is over the 4 GB size limit for FAT32 volumes, the Boot Camp Assistant fail to complete this task.\nYou reference a solution where this file would be broken down into smaller files. However, there is a possibility that this solution alone would not be sufficient. If the internal FAT32 formatted value was to small in size to contain all the files in the latest Windows 10 ISO, then the Boot Camp Assistant would again fail.\nThe obvious solution would be to upgrade to a newer version of macOS, where the volume would be exFAT formatted and sufficient in size. Beyond the obvious, here are the steps I would suggest following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software.\n\n*Shrink the macOS partition and create a new ExFAT formatted partition labeled BOOTCAMP.\n\n*Erase a 16 GB or larger flash drive. Use ExFAT format and a Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme.\n\n*Mount the ISO. Copy all the files to the 16 GB flash drive.\n\n*Copy all the Window Support Software files to the 16 GB flash drive.\n\n*Boot the mac from the flash drive. Look for EFI Boot in the Mac Startup Manager. My suspicion is that this will fail because your Mac has not had the firmware upgrade provided by installing High Sierra. If this happens, proceed as follows.\n\n*Erase a 8 GB or larger flash drive. Use MS-DOS (FAT) format and a Master Boot Record (MBR).\n\n*Copy all the files, except for the sources\\install.wim file, from the 16 GB flash drive to the 8 GB flash drive.\n\n*Boot from the 8 GB flash drive and install Windows 10 to the BOOTCAMP volume. (You will have to format this volume before proceeding)\n\n*A some point during installation, the Mac may boot back to macOS. If this occurs, select Windows as the startup disk in System Preferences, then restart the Mac. Installation of Windows will continue.\n\n\nThe method relies on booting from the FAT32 formatted flash drive and having the Windows installer automatically find the install.wim file on the ExFAT formatted flash drive. It seems improbably that this would work, but it did when testing in VirtualBox.\n", "Q: Checking Certificates Meet Apple Requirements is there a command or UI I can use to test certificates or diagnose why they aren't valid?\nA while back Apple changed the requirements for TLS certificates, and announced dates from when those changes would take effect. For example not accepting certificates that last longer than 865 days, requiring extended attributes, etc.\nIf I use such a certificate, Chrome/Safari don't tell me why it isn't considered invalid if it's an Apple enforced reason such as the ones above.\nIt'd be great to have a go-to debugging step that'll tell me if a certificate is or isn't good that includes the Apple restrictions.\nClarification: I'm not interested in generating certificates or how to code them. I just want to know how to test if a given certificate is valid on a MacOS system using the terminal or some other OS UI\n\nA: So it turns out there is an OS level tool, security\nFor example, I can test if a certificate ca.crt is valid like this:\nsecurity verify-cert -c ca.crt\n\nHere's what a valid certificate will look like:\n❯ security verify-cert -c ca.crt\n...certificate verification successful.\n\nAnd here's a certificate with a 10 year expiration that violates Apples rules, but is otherwise valid according to OpenSSH:\n❯ security verify-cert -c ca.crt\nCert Verify Result: CSSMERR_TP_NOT_TRUSTED\n\n\nA: There are two possible ways using the CLI to check the validity of certificates:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have the certificate files somewhere accessible on your harddisk.\n\n*You only have them installed, but not accessible on the harddisk.\n\n\nNumber one needs a bit more CLI work, number two can be done online and shows the complete certificate chain.\n\n\n*\n\n*You have the certificate files somewhere accessible on your harddisk.\nFor checking the certificate file, we need to know in which format they are. Here is an example with a PEM format file:\nopenssl x509 -in FILENAME -text\nYou can also choose the input format with \nopenssl x509 -inform PEM -in FILENAME -text\n(PEM is default)\nThat gives you a quite long text output on each certificate file and you have to validate the issuer, the CN, the expiration date manually by comparing it to the CA or root certificate.

Then the slideout ends up interrupting my action or blocking my view of the web page.\nHow do I stop this sidebar from appearing when my mouse is at the left of the display?\nThis upvoted answer for macOS El Capitan (apparently) doesn't work for me.\n\nA: There isn't a way to stop this from happening with conventional methods (i.e. through settings or modifying a .plist file.) It has also been around since Safari 9 from what I can glean from my researches. Search on this site, and in Google in general, to find ways to 'trick' Safari by moving the Dock to the left side of the screen, changing some parameters through a defaults write command to a .plist file and setting up some trackpad swipes and whatnot. Complicated and ultimately a kludge.\n", "Q: kernel_task takes a lot of memory My kernel_task takes 71.2G VIRT and 2386M RES (in htop screen). I'd like to understand what takes so much resource. But I don't understand what is wrong based on the output of sudo zprint -t https://pastebin.com/hWSRmn0N. Could anybody take a look what is wrong? Thanks.\n\nA: It is normal for kernel_task to show those values. This is not something that is a \"problem\" in any sense, or makes your system slow or anything like that.\nThe 71.2 GB of virtual memory is indeed virtual - so it doesn't (necessarily) have anything to do with actual memory being used. Your computer most probably has a 64-bit CPU capable of adressing huge amounts of virtual memory.\nUsually Intel-based computer have operating systems that limit actual virtual memory usage to either 48 bits or 57 bits. In your case the 71.2 GB of virtual corresponds to just over 36 bits. I.e. it is really nothing - about 0.02% percent of the virtual memory available to the system.\n", "Q: Search ﬁ (one character) as fi (two characters) in mdfind In the pdf below, the two characters f and i is contracted into the one-character ligature ﬁ as in \"significance\". So that when I searched \"Brown Adipose Tissue: Function and Physiological Significance\" (f and i are two characters) by mdfind, I did find this pdf. Is there a way to search such PDF files with mdfind by \"... Significance\" where \"f\" and \"i\" do not ligature?\nhttps://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00015.2003\n$ mdfind -onlyin . \"(kMDItemTextContent=='Brown Adipose Tissue: Function and Physiological Significance'c)\" # two characters.\n$ mdfind -onlyin . \"(kMDItemTextContent=='Brown Adipose Tissue: Function and Physiological Signiﬁcance'c)\" # one character\n/Users/xxx/Downloads/x/physrev.00015.2003.pdf\n\nNote that the following should not be used as it searches in kMDItemTitle as well.\n$ mdfind -onlyin . 'Brown Adipose Tissue: Function and Physiological Significance' # two characters\n/Users/xxx/Downloads/x/physrev.00015.2003.pdf\n\n\nA: Although the fi characters are displayed as a single ligature glyph, they are understood within the PDF as distinct letters. (And within every other text app such as TextEdit, Pages, Safari, etc, which will also display ligatures and understand them as separate characters.)\nI can search in Safari or Preview within the PDF for the letters fi, and get the ligature in the results:\n\nI can also copy and paste the text, or export it from the PDF, and the text has separate characters for that ligature.\nHowever, results using Spotlight do seem to be more variable. If I create a PDF from TextEdit with the word 'office' using ligature glyphs, that word is not be found in a Spotlight search. If I do the same from Affinity Publisher, the word is found. \nI have other PDFs with ligature glyphs that Spotlight can search.\nIt is of course also possible to produce a PDF where the underlying chars are not preserved.\nTL;DR: it seems that Spotlight is choosy about font encoding when indexing PDF text content. Text encoded with a Type 1 Roman encoding does not produce the correct result.\nSo your options are to write a shell script that offers up the ligated Unicode glyphs whenever the relevant combination of characters occur (fi, fl, ffi, ffl, ct, st), and search PDFs using both forms; or use a non-Spotlight method of querying the text in the PDF.\n\nA: ﬁ can be typed as one character via OptionShift5.\nThere is a Terminal preference under the Profiles tab, select the profile in use, and then click the 'Keyboard' tab, at the very bottom, that changes Option to Meta.\n\nIf you have this enabled you'll probably just get a 5, but no matter the result you don't get ﬁ. The easiest result would be to enter ﬁ into any other text field, cut and paste it into your Terminal.\n", "Q: export from photos (mac) including edited metadata I received a bunch of photos that didn't have any correct metadata. I have then manually corrected the time and gps information within the photos app. \nWhen I export this files, those information are gone. They are not visible in the exifdata. \nWhat can I do to get an image out of photos without loosing all those edits?\n\nA: Metadata edits and location information assigned using the Photos application exist only in the Photos library database. The Photos application does not modify your original images. I.e. it does not write EXIF / IPTC geotags to your image files.\nThe Photos application can bake some of the metadata into JPEGs you export. These are JPEG copies of your images with your adjustments applied. You need to allow the Photos application to include location information for published items. There is a setting for this when you export photo. A second setting in Photos > Preferences applies when you use drag-and-drop to export photos. \nYou should consider proper geotagging that writes GPS location information into the your original image files. Be sure to use a tool that does so without compromising image quality by recompressing JPEG files. Writing GPS tags to EXIF metadata within the files creates files similar to what a GPS-enabled camera produces. You can be sure that the information always stays with your image files even as you move to a different photo software. \n\nA: In Photos for Monterey and Big Sur, data added via the Info window is embedded in the metadata if you do File > Export > Export N photos, and check mark 'Keep Title, Keywords, Caption' and 'Keep Location'. Description and GPS data are updated in EXIF Info and Caption, Title and Keywords in IPTC Info.\n", "Q: How can Transit app vibrate my phone even with notification sounds turned off? I've been tweaking my notification settings for various apps recently, and today I noticed something very peculiar.\nI was using the Transit App in Go mode as I do on most days. As I approached my destination, I felt my phone vibrate... but I had already turned off Sounds in the notification settings for this app! (See below) I'm sure the vibrate was from Transit App because I had exactly one notification in my Notification Centre right after I got the vibration.\nIs there any way to suppress vibrations from app notifications, since apparently turning off sounds doesn't do it?\n\nAdditional info about my phone settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Silent switch: Off\n\n*Do Not Disturb: Off\n\n*Vibrate on Ring: On\n\n*Vibrate on Silent: Off\n\n*Ringer volume: 50%\n\n*System Haptics: On\n\n\nA: When Transit App is in Go mode, it can deliver notifications using the Turn-by-turn API which has some special privileges.\n\n\n*\n\n*Vibration is possible if Notifications are turned on for Transit App, even if all the specific options are turned off. Disabling notifications for the app prevents vibration.\n\n*Audible announcement of upcoming stops is permitted even if notifications are entirely disabled for Transit App. But of course audible announcements will only play if enabled in Transit App by toggling the sound icon in Go mode.\n\n\nThese special notifications also seem to bypass Do Not Disturb mode. \n", "Q: How can I tell if a MacOS App is notarized or sandboxed? I'm running MacOS Catalina.  How can I tell if a particular MacOS App downloaded from the Internet is notarized and/or sandboxed?\n\nA: I'm not sure if this helps but if you open System Information and in the side bar, go down to Software > Applications, you should see all the applications installed on your Mac. Clicking on any app will show you their certificates, version, and where you obtained these applications (i.e. from Mac App Store, Apple, identified developer or unknown).\nTo access System Information you can open it from a Spotlight Search, or click on the About this Mac in the Apple Menubar, and click on System Report. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: You can tell this with taccy from the Eclectic Light Company. It reports directly on whether an app is notarized (although I find its \"Developer ID\" checkbox behavior confusing -- it doesn't check it if the app is notarized, even though notarized apps are developer-ID signed).\ntaccy doesn't explicitly report whether the app is sandboxed, but you can tell from the detailed display. If the \"Entitlements\" section says \"Property list incorrect format\", that seems to indicate it's not sandboxed. Here's an example of its report on an old (pre-sandbox and notarization) version of Firefox:\n\n", "Q: Cycle Finder windows but exclude the desktop My workflow often involves comparing two Finder windows side by side. I use shortcut 2 (see screenshot) to quickly cycle between the windows. However, the annoying thing is that the cycle also includes the desktop as a 'window'. Instead, I would just like to cycle between the two floating windows.\nThe closest I've come to achieve this is shortcut 1. This shortcut excludes the desktop, but unfortunately it will also cycle between the windows of all apps. It also doesn't work properly in Split View.\nIs it possible to make shortcut 2 exclude the desktop? If not, is there another method to achieve what I want?\nTo be clear: I really want to exclude the desktop from the cycle because that enables me to use one shortcut to switch between the windows. I'm aware that you can go to the previous window using shift, but it's just way, way easier to go back and forth using the same shortcut.\nUpdate 1: I just discovered that my question has been asked before: Command Tilde in Finder, prevent focus on Desktop at end of cycle. However, I don't think the answer there solves the problem.\nUpdate 2: My solution.\n\n\nA: First, you're going to need an AppleScript that can swap the position of the two frontmost windows.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set index of window 1 to 2\nend tell\n\nNow you need a way to make this script easily accessible from the Finder. We'll use macOS services, and Automator makes this super easy for us.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator\n\n*Make a New Document of type \"Quick Action\" (or \"Service\" in older macOS)\n\n*Drag a new Run Applescript action into the workflow. You can find it in the Utilities category, or just search for it in the search bar.\n\n*Copy the AppleScript shown above into the script box.\n\n*Press ▶ to try it out. You'll get an error if you have fewer than two windows open -- I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader to fix.\n\n*Save the workflow as Swap Front Windows. The moment you save it, it will become accessible from the Services menu under the application menu.\n\n\nAt this point you can really try it out. Go to the Finder and open two windows. Then go to the menu bar, choose Finder -> Services -> Swap Front Windows. It takes a moment, but it works. That's cool, now let's hook it up as a keyboard shortcut.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Go into Keyboard Preferences\n\n*Go to the Shortcuts tab\n\n*Go into the Services category\n\n*Scroll down to the bottom. Underneath General you should see Swap Front Windows.\n\n*Select the \"Swap Front Windows\" row, then click Add Shortcut.\n\n*Enter the shortcut you want to use. I recommend Ctrl + Shift + `.\n\n\nA: It's not entirely obvious from the Shortcuts Preference pane listing, but on most MacOS applications, you can switch the focus between two windows in their index order by with keystroke Command-&grave; for the next window and keystroke Command-Shift-&grave; for the previous window.\n\nA: In the end, the best solution turned out to be to create an AppleScript:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if (count windows) > 0 then\n        set index of window (count windows) to 1\n    end if\nend tell\n\nAnd bind it to a shortcut via the great utility FastScripts, which doesn't have the 0.5 second delay that you have with Automator services.\n", "Q: Difference between charging icons - does it mean anything?

Your Mac is using power directly from the cord.\n\n\nFull battery icon with lightning bolt means the device is plugged-in and the battery is charging.  Your Mac can use power from both the cord and battery.\n\n\nA: Lightning + empty battery icon means the battery is charging.\nLightning + full battery icon means the battery isn't charging.\nYou can confirm by clicking the battery indicator, and the drop-down menu will tell you if the battery is charging or not:\n\n(\"2:44 until full\" is referring to battery recharging)\n\nAdditional source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6751144\nThe design of the icons seemed counter-intuitive to me at first, but I guess it makes sense if you think in terms of power source:\nBattery only (i.e. when not plugged in) - battery is supplying power\nLightning only - the power cord is supplying power (allowing the battery to recharge)\nLightning + battery - BOTH the power cord AND the battery are supplying power (so the battery is not being recharged)(note: this also appears when the battery is fully charged)\n", "Q: Write in English using a foreign keyboard layout on iPad As a bilingual user, this is something that have frustrated me for a while now.\nThe OS defaults to changing the keyboard layout along with the input language.

Most apps come packaged in a .dmg file, where once mounted all you have to do is copy the .app, special directory to you Applications folder and that's it. Nice and clean, if you ever want to uninstall the app, you just remove it.\nHowever, what about .pkg files? I know there are some commercial solutions, but really, that's not to satisfactory.\n\nA: Each .pkg file generally differ in where they install the files, so unlike a .app bundle, there is no generalized way to uninstall the contents of a .pkg file.\nA .pkg file is an installer package. It is run with the help of the macOS built-in Installer app, and allows the installation of the files contained under the package under various directories as programmed by the developer of the software.\nHere's are a bunch of approaches that can be tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the .pkg file and any associated files provided by the developer. Sometime, such software package also come with either a dedicated or a built-in uninstaller. Running the uninstaller generally takes care of uninstalling the files/apps installed by the package.\nIf you don't find any obvious uninstaller, consider contacting the developers of the app and ask them.\n\n*Use a 3rd party utility such as AppCleaner to uninstall the .pkg installed app. It gives you a simple interface to look through and select from all the installed apps, locates all the files associated with an app, and let you uninstall the app(s) completely.\nFrom the app website:\n\nAppCleaner is a small application which allows you to thoroughly uninstall unwanted apps.\nInstalling an application distributes many files throughout your System using space of your Hard Drive unnecessarily.\nAppCleaner finds all these small files and safely deletes them.\nSimply drop an application onto the AppCleaner window. It will find for the related files and you can delete them by clicking the delete button.\n\n\n*Prefer using Homebrew Cask to install the desired GUI app(s), if the developers is distributing them via Homebrew.

There are similar questions being asked, but the answers seem to all be similar... that the person asking the question doesn't have high usage.\nI have a iMac Retina 5K, 27in, 2017 with a 3.4Ghz i5. Purchased a year ago and barely use it, so it's basically brand new. I just recently upgraded to Catalina version 10.15.3. my iMac has been unbareably slow since the Catalina install. it barely worked with 8GB of RAM and an Apple support person took a look at my iMac and saw that I was using 7.6GB of memory and suggested I downgrade to Mojave or install more RAM, so my first step was to remove the 8GB and install 32GB. My iMac is running only slightly faster with the 32GB installed. It stopped crashing on a daily basis, which is great, but things still take a while to open after I click on them. I still get the spinning beachball and if I look at Activity Monitor my memory pressure is in the red even when I have nothing running (except for Activity Monitor).  \nThe attached screenshot is taken about 5mins after turning on my iMac and the only thing I have running is Activity Monitor.\nIs there something wrong with Catalina? Is something wrong with the memory I installed? Why  is my memory pressure in the red?  Does it have something to do with sharingd or suggestd? They are always at the top of the list.\nAny suggestions on what I should do?\nThanks\n\n\nA: I too started experiencing this problem after I installed Catalina on my 2019 iMac Retina 5K with 3.6 Ghz 8-Core I9 processor and 32 GB memory (4 days ago).  I had no such problems prior to my upgrade.  I turned off Airdrop with no effect.  Unfortunately, I can't disable remote disks as I'm very much in need of icloud and screen sharing.  I tried turning off all my other icloud devices, but that didn't seem to have any effect either. My CPU usage by the \"sharingd\" processis 15 times higher than my next most CPU intensive process.  It also appears to be cycling up to 100% plus CPU usage for about 5-10 seconds every 20-30 seconds.  Fan speed is also varying in line with the cpu temperature,  as would be expected (1200 RPM goes to 2400 RPM).\nI tried taking the issue to Apple Support, but even after getting pushed up to 2nd level, they were no help.  They seemed clueless about what sharingd does and how to troubleshoot it.  They basically ran me through POPO and SMC Reset and then gave up.  They suggested it must be a hardware problem even though diagnostics ran clean and no other evidence supports that conclusion.\nI've also tried shutting down all my 3rd party apps and no effect from that either.\nI am now wondering if possibly Apple is running some form of file conversion/tweaking on my icloud stored photos, movies, or music in background as part of the upgrade and maybe this is causing file sync issues. If so, hopefully it will eventually finish and go away! But I'm not hopeful.  Personally, I think it is a Catalina bug that Apple is not yet acknowledging.\nUPDATED 4/19/2020  (PROBLEM PARTIALLY IDENTIFIED and TEMPORARY FIX)\nAfter further investigation, I found that turning off icloud on my system (or turning off the network so it couldn't talk to icloud) caused sharingd to go quiet (vs. near 100% CPU utilization).  I also started to notice that the process AddressBookSourceSync is also running (at moderate levels) when sharingd is running at high CPU.  On a hunch, I turned my icloud back on, but just disabled Contacts (in System Preferences > AppleID).  With Contacts off, my system is back to running quietly.  Therefore it appears that the high CPU utilization of the sharingd process somehow relates to trying to sync with Contacts (address book) in icloud.  So at least I have a temporary fix (i.e. turning off contacts, except when needed), but caution, losing contacts has negative impacts on identifying people in imessage threads, etc.  So admittedly this is a very limited fix.\nFIXED 5/3/2020  (at least on my system)\nRealizing my above temporary fix was not cutting it for me and still being suspicious that my address book system (Contacts) was somehow corrupted during my upgrade to Catalina, I decided I needed to completely unload and reinstall my local copy of my address book system.  Not knowing exactly how to do that, I searched and found this article https://ugetfix.com/ask/how-to-fix-addressbooksourcesync/ which walked me through the process.  This procedure should work as long as your local address \nbook is synced with iCloud.  Although the article addresses symptoms I didn't have, it did the trick as far as allowing me to unload and reload my local address book system.  Once I performed this procedure it was immediately apparent that this fixed my problem with high sharingd process CPU usage and the corresponding high memory usage by addressbooksourcesync. My sharingd process is now only using small amounts of CPU, somewhere approximately in the range of .1% to 4.5% CPU (vs 100+% CPU previously).  AddressBookSourceSync's memory use also is much lower now too, about 300MB vs. Gigbytes prior to the fix (sorry I forgot to record the exact memory usage initially).  I don't know if this will help others, but it might be worth a try.  Just make sure your local addressbook (Contacts) and icloud addressbook (Contacts) are in good syncronization before you start. I also added one step to this procedure as an added measure of safety.  I exported all my Contacts to a PDF file prior to starting.  I did that just in case something went horribly wrong and I had to re-enter them manually. Fortunately, that was not necessary!  One last comment: for whatever reason, I found no .plist file (the one that the author of this procedure mentions) in my ~/Library/Application Support/Address Book/ folder, either before or after performing the procedure.\n\nA: Is there something wrong with Catalina? \nThe OS always has a part to play in any problem, but it's only one of many components. \nIs something wrong with the memory I installed? \nUnlikely: it's available and being used.\nWhy is my memory pressure in the red? Does it have something to do with sharingd or suggestd? \nIndeed it does.\nsuggestd is  daemon that processes user content in order to detect contacts, events, named entities, etc. It receives content from Mail, Spotlight, Messages and other apps.\nsharingd is used by the Finder to enable AirDrop file sharing, connecting to shared computers, and accessing Remote Discs from other computers.  \nWhat should I do?\nYou have reported that other user accounts work normally. That means you have pinpointed the cause to something within your user account. So reinstalling the OS won't help. Some people might recommend migrating everything to a new user account, but it's actually better to solve the problem here. (If it happens again, will you move to another user, and another...?)\nThe cause is therefore something in your user Library. Possibly something in the Preferences subfolder. There is also a subfolder called \"Sharing\", which might be at fault. The Preferences subfolder may have files called com.apple.sharingd.plist and com.apple.suggestd.plist which you could delete. Anything with sharing and suggest in the filenames: delete!\nYou can safely delete anything in the user Library and test whether it improves things. Firstly, you've got a backup, so you can always restore stuff, and secondly because deleting everything just leaves you with the equivalent of a 'new' user account: the OS sets everything to default. \nOf course, there will be things you want to keep, so don't go mad. Remove something, reboot and test. Put it back if no effect.\n\nA: I experienced a similar problem or better to say a series of problems.\nThe first one was that if I deleted a huge amout of data on a drive, the information about the free space didn't change. I deleted up to 400GB and nothing changed. The next problem was that I started to get low memory warnings while running Final Cut Pro X. I had 24GB installed and I never experienced this before in Mojave with the same type of projects. I upgraded the memory to 48GB and I was still surprised by the extreme RAM usage. After some time the CPU started to get very busy, even if there was nothing going on.\nAfter some googling I found that it was caused by a kind of virus, which is probably originated by a developer who makes a software which is supposed to clean Your Mac. So people start getting this problems, they search on Google and get an offer to buy such software, which will delete the virus and the customer is happy for buying such a useful software.\nSo what You need to do is deleting all browser data in the browser(s) use use, including cookies, history and cache. This should solve the problem as it did in my case.\nHere is a link to the article I followed:\nhttps://macsecurity.net/view/325-your-computer-is-low-on-memory-mac-virus\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different!\nPls try these measures and see if they help:\nShort-term\nSee if you can Quit or Force Quit either the sharingd or suggestiond process: you can do this by selecting either process in the Activity Monitor and pressing Option ⌥+Command ⌘ +Q. \nIf you can quit either, this would speed up your computer until the next reboot.\nLong-term\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Sharing and see if any of the listed services (Screen Sharing, File Sharing, etc.) is enabled. Disable any that is enabled.\n\n*Right-click or control-click after selecting the line below and select Services > Show in Finder\n~/Library/Suggestions\nThis should open a Finder window with the \"Suggestions\" folder selected.

See these warnings and directions about turning off the iCloud from Apple support in case you wish to try this but note that the copies of the files also on the iCloud already stored locally on your iMac are not deleted from your iMac when you sign out of the iCloud.\n\n\nEven if turning off iCloud fixes the memory problem, I would suggest turning it on again and see what happens. You may have to wait for a while depending on the size of your user data files for a full sync with iCloud when you turn it on again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Migrate to another iMac user: Considering the nature of the problem, it would be wise to move only the user data files (any documents, pictures, music and video files, etc.), but not the user system setting and customization files such as those under the ~/library/ folder. That means you have to restore your documents, pictures and music folders yourself from a backup or copy them from under your existing iMac user and then have the respective programs such as the Music app or the Photos app manually recognize their respective files in case necessary.\n\n\nI think the easy way to transfer pretty much all of the user data files (but not the user system setting and customization files) would be to sign in with the same iCloud account from your new iMac user (iCloud syncs the user data files, not the user system setting and customization files) assuming all user data files have been recently synched from the existing iMac user. \n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall Catalina: Same precautions about moving of only the user data files are advised if Catalina is reinstalled\n\n\nA: I had the same issue with sharingd experiencing an apparent memory leak on a 2017 MacBook Pro running 10.15.5. Other ideas I saw around the internet like resetting bluetooth didn't work on my machine, and if I force quit the process the issue would return. However, rrh 7254's solution of disabling Contacts in iCloud did work for me.\nWhat I will add is that after I disabled Contacts in iCloud and saw sharingd return to normal behavior (~40MB) for a few days, I was able to re-enable it and the issue has not returned (yet?), even after a few days and a reboot.\nEDIT: After a few days of being stable with Contacts reenabled in iCloud, the issue is back; it didn't start back up immediately.\n\nA: I experienced this problem when I installed Catalina. I had to revert back to Mojave to solve the sluggishness. Thank goodness I had a backup on Time Machine, but it was a long and nail-biting process. I also had upgraded to 32GB, which is what allowed me to remove Catalina. I think. My Mac is an early 2014 and is happy without Catalina. It would be nice to hear that Apple is working to solve this problem. No word, so far.

Now I need to update the OS to 10.13 (the latest one this system supports). \nHere's the catch: months ago I attempted to install 10.13 on an SD card plugged into the system. The install failed, possibly because it ran out of space on the card. \nBut now when I go to the App Store and try to download 10.13, it tells me the version is already installed. It's not!

It is super frustrating for me to not be able to check my email using Apple mail.\n\nA: I too had the exact same issue with Apple's Mail app as you described.

So the 2 station setup probably doesn’t support a heavy computer usage scenario. But it’s clean and compact and portable and relatively light weight.

That gives a weight of about 15kgs (11 for battery + 4 for CSV409), all that is in my caravan but it could as well be in a box.\n\nA: I've worked as far afield as Northern Nigeria as a technologist (Infrastructure & Network Engineering), where reliable power is always an issue. Indeed, reliable energy is a problem endemic to many lesser developed nations across the globe.  Closer to home, many folks are looking to go off-grid to escape the rat-race but still want to stay connected to the wider world.\nSince powering a Mac (my solution can be used to power any AC device) seemed of broader utility to a wider audience, figured I'd share my documentation on design considerations & physical connectivity to save others solving the same-very complex - problem. Lots of annotated pictures are included at end of post to visually detail the physical connectivity between the components.\n\n\n*\n\n*SYSTEM OVERVIEW: I'll explain the system conceptually in (2) parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*COLLECTION: Solar Panels sends Direct Current (DC) to a 12v battery (also DC) via a “Solar Controller” that regulates transfer of DC from panels to battery to ~12v.  Without a Solar Charge Controller the Solar Panels could create an over-voltage condition sending as much as 20v+ to a 12v battery.\n\n*DISTRIBUTION: On the other side of the battery an “AC Power Inverter” is connected that converts battery’s Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) when connected end-user devices draw power.\n\n*POWER EQUILIBRIUM: The COLLECTION side of the system should ideally replace what is being drawn from battery on DISTRIBUTION side.  If more is drawn out than replaced, battery will start to drain to its' Depth of Discharge (\"DoD) limit and the inverter your devices are connected to will cut-out.\n\n\n*CHOOSING SYSTEM COMPONENTS: Key considerations:\n\n\n*\n\n*SOLAR PANELS: These convert sunlight to DC which is sent to a 12v battery (also DC) for storage. The Solar Panel’s nominal wattage is sum of all panels configured into in an array: ie, my 200 watt solar panels are actually an array of (4) x 50 watt solar panels.\n\n\n*\n\n*SOLAR PANEL EFFICIENCY: you’ll see a figure such as “19.8” in the manufacturers specs.  So for my 200 watt panels, that would be the conversion of 1000 watt/m2.  Under ideal test conditions.  The Earth rotates and both duration of sunlight & intensity can vary with both season & geography. “200 watts” is nominal; effective wattage will be some degree less.\n\n*APPROPRIATE WATTAGE: Calculate your power requirements FIRST and THEN buy Solar Panels that will keep the battery topped-up at at least the same level devices are drawing power from the battery.  You can only know what panels you require after you’ve determined what devices you want to power with the Solar Power System ie, a 96 watt 2018 MacBook and a printer of X watts\n\n*WEIGHT: My 200 watt panels panels weigh 5.15 KGs. If I bought the 150 watt model- (3)x50watt- I could have reduced their weight by 25%. Keep wattage sizing of panels as close to your actual power requirements as possible to avoid killing your luggage weight allowance.\n\n*PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS: Check length & width measurements of any panels (fully folded) BEFORE buying to ensure they’ll fit in your suitcase!\n\n\n*SOLAR CHARGE CONTROLLER: This device sits between your solar panels and battery storing panel’s DC output. Controller regulates flow of electricity from panels to battery ensuring panels don’t send 20v to a 12v battery.\n\n\n*\n\n*(2) Types:  “PWM” vs “MPPT”:  Ref: https://www.solar4rvs.com.au/buying/buyer-guides/choosing-the-right-solar-charge-controller-regulat/\n\n\n*\n\n*PWM (“PULSE MODULATION WIDTH”):\n\n*MPPT (“Maximum Power Point Tracking”):\n\n\n*REDUNDANCY: If Controller fails, you’re out of the game.  They’re not expensive and very lightweight, so only a downside to not keeping a spare.\n\n*BATTERY COMPATIBILITY: Ensure battery to be connected to Solar Controller compatible with battery. Do NOT connect the Controller to any random battery without checking compatibility, or you could damage the Controller.  The Controller’s user manual should have have details about battery compatibility, providing codes for battery types that work with it. Batteries will be discussed in §3 “12v BATTERY”(only b00-b03). Use below list to interpret codes specified in the Controller’s manual if required:\n\n\n*\n\n*b00: Lithium Battery\n\n*b01: Sealed Battery\n\n*b02: Gel Battery\n\n*b03: Flood\n\n*b04: Iron Lithium 4 strands\n\n*b05: Iron Lithium 5 Strands\n\n*b06: Lithium Ion 3 Strands\n\n*b07: Lithium Ion 4 Strands\n\n\n\n*BATTERY:  The 12v battery receives DC output from Solar Panels (via Solar Charge Controller) and also supplies an Inverter connected to it which converts battery’s DC power to AC for end-user devices; your MacBook.  You require a battery “vocabulary” when Googling to source an appropriate one, or you either won’t know what to search for, or won’t be able to interpret the results.\n\n\n*\n\n*COMPATIBILITY WITH SOLAR CONTROLLER:  Read your Controller’s user manual to determine what battery to source. Using a battery which is NOT can potentially damage Controller! \n\n*BATTERY CAPACITY (Ah):  A battery’s capacity is described in terms of “Ah” (“Amp Hour”), ie, a 100 Ah battery theoretically can power a  1 amp device for 100 hours, or a 10 amp device for 10 hours. However, this is a nominal number and MUST be multiplied by battery's “Depth of Discharge” to determine practical capacity of the battery.\n\n*“DEPTH OF DISCHARGE” (“DoD”): Large 12v batteries are not designed to be fully drained like a flashlight’s batteries. DoD is the *USABLE capacity  of a battery’s Ah rating, ie, a 100 Ah battery with a DoD 50% means that for all practical purposes your inverter is connected to a 50Ah battery.  Forget the other 50Ah, you can’t use it...\n\n*BATTERY TYPES: \n\n\n*\n\n*STARTING, LIGHTING, IGNITION “SLI”: Batteries designed to start a car and power its’ lights.  “STI” batteries NOT desirable for use with Solar Power Systems. Shallow Depth of Discharge cycles- around ~10%. Not very suitable for Solar Power Systems.\n\n*DEEP CYCLE: Ideal battery for Solar Power Systems.  Deep Cycle batteries are  designed to have a much greater DoD over a sustained period- usually around 50%- then cranking batteries which can have a DoD of as high as 70%.  Check both Amazon & Google “12v Deep Cycle Batteries” and you’ll see many shops selling them in the following flavours:\n\n\n*\n\n*LEAD ACID BATTERY:  Although “CALCIUM” is a type of “LEAD ACID” battery, it’s found in “SLI” (cranking”) batteries and should be avoided.  You’d probably be better off using a cigarette lighter powered inverter to power your devices off the rental vehicle’s battery. (2) Types Lead Acid Batteries:\n\n\n*\n\n*FLOODED: When the term “FLOODED” is seen in a Solar Controller’s user manual it’s referring to a “wet” Lead Acid Battery found in cars. Being “flooded”, not desirable for environments of extremes of hot & cold. Identified by both apertures to add water and a “sloshing” noise when moved.  Cheaper to buy & have excellent comparative useful life, but require maintenance.  Unless you’re willing to be bothered maintaining them, avoid Flooded batteries.   \n\n*VALVE REGULATED LEAD ACID (“VRLA”): Unlike “Flooded” batteries which CAN’T be sealed because of the need to add water to them, VRLA batteries are referred to as “SEALED** because they require no/little maintenance. More expensive than “Flooded” batteries. (2) Types:\n\n\n*\n\n*Absorbed Glass Mat (“AGM”)\n\n*GEL\n\n\n\n*LITHIUM ION BATTERY: More expensive than LEAD ACID batteries and only have a 3 year life- regardless of use.\n\n\n\n*SIZING BATTERIES: Let’s put it all together. Your goal is to ensure the battery remains level- putting in an amount equal to what the devices connected to the inverter are sucking out of it. You want to avoid- or delay- as much as possible more draw-down than top-up as if you slip down to the DoD max, the inverter will (hopefully) start beeping and just shutdown. Ideally, size the battery a bit larger than you require- unless you can guarantee tomorrow won’t be a cloudy day. Since the Battery is rated in Ah, and our panels and inverter watts, we need to convert watt hours (“Wh”) for the panels and devices drawing on the battery through the inverter into Ah.  Using an example of 200 watt Solar Panels charging the battery and (2) x 96 watt MacBook Pros (2018) drawing on that battery for a 1 hour period:  Solar Panels: 200 Watts  x 1 hour = 200 Wh . MacBook: 192 Watts  x 1 hour = 170 Wh.  Next convert Wh into Ah:  Solar Panels: 200  Wh / 12.7 volts = 15.74 Ah (Power Collection) .  MacBook:          192  Wh / 12.7 volts = 15.12 Ah (Power Distributed) (https://convert-formula.com/ah-wh) .  If you had a 75 Ah cranking battery with a DoD of 10%, that’s just 7.5 Ah available for the two MacBooks.  And not even that! there’s about ~10% loss when the Inverter converts the DC from the battery to AC for the MacBooks!  Hopefully this underscores the importance of both using Deep Cycle batteries.\n\n*SOURCING BATTERY ABROAD: Identify sources that sell/rent DEEP CYCLE batteries types compatible with your Solar Controller BEFORE travelling, or risk spending 1 or more days searching for suitable batteries or failing altogether.  In the US or Europe sourcing a Deep Cycle battery should be possible, but the more remote your destination, the more challenging sourcing a battery for your Solar Power System in-country will be.\n\n\n*INVERTER:  Converts battery’s Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) when drawn by devices connected to inverter.\n\n\n*\n\n*TYPES:\n\n\n*\n\n*PURE SINE WAVE:  Best voltage waveform output, works with all devices\n\n*MODIFIED SINE WAVE: Cheaper alternative than Pure Sign Wave, but CAN (not guaranteed) introduce interference into audio equipment, monitors & TVs.  Not recommended for devices with “high surge” startup power requirements.  Modified sine wave also might not work with power tools and/or battery chargers for cordless tools.  Finally, I’ve read many people are using modified sine wave inverters to power computers without problems; YMMV…\n\n\n*APPROPRIATE WATTAGE:  (2) things you need to consider when choosing a wattage.\n\n\n*\n\n*INVERTER CONTINUOUS AC OUTPUT POWER:  If the inverter is “1000” watts and the continuous wattage is 1000 watts, theoretically you should be able to power 10 x 1000 watt devices (assuming the battery and solar panels can support that!).  However, I bought a 500 watt Modified Sine Wave Inverter (it was cheap) only to read in the user manual the *continuous, was just 400 watts; 20% less than then advertised.  Do your homework to avoid surprises. First determine your wattage requirements for the devices you’ll connect to it. \n\n*INVERTER SURGE POWER: Check surge power wattage of inverter you’re considering buying can additionally meet surge power demand to accommodate any devices being greedy on startup.\n\n*CALCULATION: Add the wattage of the devices that you want to power off the inverter; it’s simple addition.  ie, (4) x 96 watt MacBook Pros 2018 and (1) x 85 watt MacBook Pro (2014) equals 469 watts.  My “500” watt Modified Sine Wave inverter would be insufficient for these requirements… I’d recommend using a Pure Sine Wave over the Modified and sizing the wattage higher than you require.\n\n\n*EFFICIENCY RATING: Percentage of DC input that is converted into AC output by inverter.  ie, an efficiency rating of 90% implies a 10% loss from the conversion.  So on the COLLECTION side of the system you need to factor this loss into your calculations sizing the Solar Panels & battery.\n\n*Inverter Cables Sizing: Although cables are packages with an inverter, If you need to buy longer ones, ensure you buy the correct gauge for your inverter’s wattage:      General Recommendations:      (Inverter Size/Cable Gauge)  1000 Watts/#4 , 1500 Watts/#2 , 2000 Watts/#1/0 , 2500 Watts/#1/0 , 3000 Watts/#3/0\n\n\n\n*INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS: Physical Connectivity\n\n\n*\n\n*PREPARATIONS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Solar Panels: Closed (folded)\n\n*Inverter: Switched to the “Off” position\n\n*NEVER LET LIVE ELECTRIC LEADS TOUCH!!!!!\n\n\n*CONNECTION:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect SOLAR CHARGE CONTROLLER to BATTERY FIRST\n\n\n*\n\n*NEGATIVE FIRST\n\n*Positive last\n\n\n*Connect SOLAR CHARGE CONTROLLER to SOLAR PANELS\n\n*Connect INVERTER to BATTERY\n\n\n*DISCONNECTION:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect INVERTER from BATTERY\n\n\n*\n\n*POSITIVE FIRST\n\n*Negative Last\n\n\n*Disconnect SOLAR PANELS from SOLAR CHARGE CONTROLLER\n\n*Disconnect SOLAR CHARGE CONTROLLER from BATTERY LAST!!\n\n\n\n\nThe connections should look as follows:\n\nThat may seem a lot, but trust me: this is a huge subject and to condense all the key detail into this was a huge effort.  Hope it helps others trying to work off-grid tapping away happily on their MacBooks (or Min-Macs, iMacs, etc....).  I'll post the link to accompany this post which shows me charging my 85 watt MacBook 2014 using solar panels shortly.  Video is done, just have to render it and upload to YouTube, but thin connectivity at the 'mo. \nUPDATE:\nHaving returned from the Omani Desert and sourcing a 5 meter extender cable to allow placing the battery and the inverter in the shade away from the solar panels, I've had a moment to pictorially document a more ideal configuration.\nTo avoid any ambiguity or confusion, everything is expressly labelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grounding Rod & cable for the inverter cost me the princely sum of £6.50:\n\n\nIf you still require further clarification, I've also created a companion video implementing my portable Solar Power solution in Oman which should fill in any questions about how confguring a portable solar power system-\n\nA: Assuming the solar panels are used to charge 12 volt batteries, and your MacBook Pro is new enough to use USB-C for power, then the solution is quite simple.  All you need is an off the shelf USB-C car charger.  I found one from Aukey that will supply 9 volts at 3 amps from a 12 volt automotive accessory outlet, also known as a cigar lighter socket.  This isn't great for powering the laptop at full power continuously but it's enough to keep it running with light loads continuously, or for an overnight recharge after running full power.\nThis will also apply to any peripherals that can run on USB-A or USB-C, use a car charger.  Most every car charger I've seen will take a wide range of voltages so don't be too concerned if your battery pack is 24 volts instead of 12 volts, just look closely at the specs before you buy.\nIn addition to Aukey I'll mention another company I have been satisfied with their products, Powerwerx.  Powerwerx sells all kinds of products for going off grid, including a panel mount USB charger.  https://powerwerx.com/panel-usbc-pd-power-delivery-qc30-blue\nThat charger is only 18 watts, not 27 watts like the Aukey one I mentioned before.  It might still work for you though.  Also on their site is all kinds of cables, wires, and adapters to hook up solar panels, batteries, and other stuff.  And they sell the solar panels, batteries, and other stuff too.  This isn't a paid endorsement, I'm just a happy customer.\n", "Q: How to run an image of El Capitan macOS as a virtual machine on another Mac? I am running Mojave macOS on a Mac mini. I would like to run a virtual machine of El Capitan on Mojave (or Catalina).\nI am looking into this because I need to refer to a database using FileMaker 11 and El Capitan was the last macOS to support it.\nWhat is a proven/reliable way to do it? Virtualbox, Fusion, Parallels?\nIs it possible, for example, to create an image of an existing Mac running FileMaker 11 on El Capitan (so I don’t have to install and configure everything all over again)?\nNeed instructions please.\n\nA: \nIs it possible, for example, to create an image of an existing Mac running FileMaker 11 on El Capitan?\n\nYou can definitely create an image of your existing Mac. The question is whether or not you can then use that image to create a virtual machine in Vmware or Parallels (whenever I have looked into Virtual Box, it has always appeared to me to be a giant pile of time-sink and frustration, so I have avoided using it.)\nDisk Utility can create an image of your hard drive. So can apps like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner. Instructions for doing so are easily found via Google, etc.\nHowever, these images will be .dmg files, not .iso files.\nThe question is whether Parallels or VMware can be use a .dmg to create a new VM.\nThere are instructions online about changing DMG files to ISO files, and I am fairly sure that ISO files can be used by both VMware and Parallels.\nSo I would say that, at least theoretically, yes, you can create an image from your existing installation of El Capitan. But I am not convinced that the process would work in practice as well as it seems like it should in theory.\nHowever, if all you are doing to use the VM for is to run FileMaker, so I'm not sure that it is either necessary or a good use of your time to try to do so.\n", "Q: Why are the Desktop, Documents, and Downloads folders empty in Samba shares? I'm sharing between iMacs with Samba. Both computers are running macOS Catalina (10.15.3). To get full disk sharing to work, I opened Settings > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access and added smbd.\nI can mount a Samba share from one iMac on the other and see the full drive. Everything seems to be working except for this very strange behavior: the Desktop, Documents, and Downloads folders (inside my user folder) all show zero bytes, zero items, and appear empty when opened.\nNone of those folders are actually empty. I can login with VNC and see the items in them fine. The permissions appear fine (my user has read/write access). All the other folders (inside and outside my user folder) show their normal contents.\nWhat is causing these specific folders to appear empty and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I double-checked the permissions (they were fine) and then restarted both client and server, and now everything is behaving normally. So maybe it just needed a restart?\n", "Q: Stop my iPhone from receiving screen shots and other images sent via SMS?

Now it will not show up again. How can I get it to show up again so I can reconnect it?\n\nA: Hold the bluetooth pairing button on your bluetooth speakers for about 3-5 seconds (typically until some audible cue is played). Then you should be able to pair it with your MacBook again in bluetooth preferences.\n", "Q: Remove Default Application for File Extension in Catalina I accidentally associated a file type with an application that doesn't work with that particular file type. (There is no application installed on my system that works with the file.) I would like to remove the default application association.

For instance, there is no ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist on my system. I would like to execute a command that removes the association for the one single file extension, not remove all of the associations for an application as this one appears to suggest. I have been able to dump the database using lsregister but I'm not sure what command could be used to remove one entry.\n\nA: A Catalina-compatible alternative to RCDefaults can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/Lord-Kamina/SwiftDefaultApps\nIt provides a preference pane and a command line utility for setting the default app of any file type.\n\n", "Q: How to delete a boot partition from MacOS Catalina A few years ago I created a second boot partition on a MacBook, called \"BootOS\".

The Applescript results window shows {tf:\"testme\"} for an input of testme, but I don't want the output markup, only the text testme copied to the clipboard.\nThe relevant part of the script is at the bottom of the full script:\n-- Get the path to the folder containing this script\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set thisFolder to (container of (path to me)) as string\n    if \"Pashua.app:\" exists then\n        -- Looks like the Pashua disk image is mounted.

To get specific items from the dialog, just get the value for the desired key.\nThe getDialogConfiguration handler just configures the dialog - the showDialog handler is what actually shows the dialog and returns a result, so that is where you would work with whatever parts of the result you are interested in.  Assuming you have the Pashua script and application in the same folder as the script, an example would be something like:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set thisFolder to (container of (path to me)) as text -- get the folder path\ntry\n    set thePath to alias (thisFolder & \"Pashua.scpt\")\n    set pashuaBinding to load script thePath\n\n    tell pashuaBinding\n        try\n            set dialogConfiguration to my getDialogConfiguration() -- configure the dialog\n            set dialogResult to showDialog(dialogConfiguration, \"\") -- show the dialog\n            set the clipboard to tf of dialogResult\n        on error errmess number errnum\n            display alert \"Error \" & errnum message \"There was an error with the Pashua dialog:\" & return & return & errmess\n        end try\n    end tell\n\non error errmess number errnum\n    display alert \"Error \" & errnum message \"There was an error setting up the Pashua script:\" & return & return & errmess\nend try\n\non getDialogConfiguration() -- return the configuration string\n    return \"\n# Set window title\n*.title = Page Settings\n\n# Add a text field\ntf.type = textfield\ntf.label = Example textfield\ntf.width = 310\n\"\nend getDialogConfiguration\n\n\nA: Shows how you get data back from Pashua:\nhttps://github.com/BlueM/Pashua-Binding-AppleScript/blob/master/Example.applescript\nexample applescript code to set clipboard data\non run\n\n  set myData to \"Hello, world\"\n\n  -- copy myData to the system clipboard\n  set the clipboard to myData\n\n  display dialog \"The clipboard data is \" & (the clipboard) giving up after 3\n\nend run\n\n", "Q: Set Mac Firmware Password from Linux I would like to set a firmware password on my MacBook Pro, but I only run Linux on it. I know I could download a macOS installer and use that to set the firmware password without installing macOS, but it would be a lot easier simply to set the password from Linux.\nIs it possible to set the Mac firmware password from Linux? If so, how?\n\nA: No, I'm not aware of any software for Linux that allows you to change the EFI firmware password on your Mac.\nIf you have a recent Mac that supports internet recovery you can reboot straight into internet recovery mode, even if the boot disk has been formatted or overwritten. Once you've booted into a recovery environment, you should be able to use the firmware password tool.\nIf you have an earlier Mac, then your best bet is to find another working Mac and create a bootable installer to get into recovery mode without needing to overwrite your Linux installation.\n", "Q: Executing bundled shell command in a hardened runtime application I have written a Java application which I want to distribute in form of a macOS application bundle. The application needs to execute a command line application which is also part of the bundle. The bundle is correctly signed (verified using the codesign command) and the hardened runtime is enabled.\nI am able to run the application, but then the application fails to execute the bundled command line application.\nThe code used to execute the command line application:\nRuntime.getRuntime().exec(\"/path/to/app/bundle/Contents/cli/myCommandLineApplication\");\n\nThe code works fine when I sign the bundle without enabling the hardened runtime.\nOnce I enable the hardened runtime, I get the following exception:\n\nCannot run program \"myCommandLineApplication\": error=0, posix_spawn failed\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?

In fact, when I enabled the hardened runtime, also a launcher application was put into place inside the bundle which starts the main application using the bundled JRE.\nAs this is the AdoptOpenJDK I mentioned, it uses spawn for Runtime.exec which caused the issue. Once I added System.setProperty( \"jdk.lang.Process.launchMechanism\", \"FORK\"); to my main method, Runtime.exec was working just fine again afterwards, even  with the hardened runtime enabled.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi disconnecting when \"under load\" At some point towards the end of last year (2019), Wi-Fi started frequently dropping off and then automatically reconnecting on my MacBook Air 2018.\nAt least two things happened around that time, that could have triggered the issue, but I do not remember when they happened and in which order, and whether it even was before or after the issue started occurring:  \n\n\n*\n\n*macOS update from Mojave to Catalina,\n\n*light drop of the laptop, which didn't seem to have affected anything else.\n\n\nThings I gradually noticed during the investigation:\n\n\n*\n\n*My connection is 50Mbs down / 4Mbs up, and it seems to be easier to reproduce when uploading data rather than downloading.

I think it is worth noting that the steps for resetting NVRAM and PRAM are the same, and did already try \"the former\", but that time it coincided with a minor macOS version update, which could have affected the reset procedure in some way.\nUpd: unfortunately, pairing back and connecting a Bluetooth device (e.g., headphones) brings the issue back, so this whole workaround is just that — a workaround.\n", "Q: Screen Sharing with Multiple Monitors I'm connecting to a work VPN through cisco anyconnect and remoting into my work computer via Mac's native Screen Sharing.\nMy work computer (iMac 2019) AND home computer (macbook pro 2014) both have dual monitors but I seem to only be able to view the remote desktop on 1 (either just the primary screen or BOTH work screens on the 1 home screen).\nQuestion:  Is it possible to screen share a dual monitor setup on 2 monitors?\nThank you so much!\n\nA: I had the same problem. The only work around I found was to duplicate the Screen Sharing application.

Probably doesn't matter if it does but I'd still be careful. I just counted the holes in the picture and there are about 1450 just in the picture with approximately 40 that are blocked.

I have an iPhone SE running iOS 10.3.3, planning to upgrade to iOS 13. A third-party app indicated I can charge to about 80% of my battery's capacity. I know that right now it lasts less time than when it was new, but it still works pretty well and is perfectly fast. I also know that iOS 13 drains battery faster than iOS 10. But at this level of battery health, would iOS 13 be an additional problem that results in performance throttling which wouldn't happen in iOS 10?\n\nA: When you go to Settings -> Battery -> Battery health you see the capacity of the battery. That number indicates the power storage capacity of the battery relative to a brand new battery. It does not directly indicate the health of the battery in terms of what you are asking for, therefore the question cannot be precisely answered in the way you have asked it.\nYou want to know when power throttling starts, but that starts after the iPhone has noticed that there has been an unexpected shutdown due to the battery not being able to deliver enough power during a peak power consuming operation. That is therefore not the same as the battery's capacity, but has to do with how much power (or amps if you will) that battery can deliver in bursts.\nThere is definitely usually a correlation between the capacity and its peak power delivery capability, but there is no direct relationship. Power storage capacity is one thing, peak power delivery capability is another. \niOS can only report directly and a priori on the first. The second is a matter of learning 'the hard way' that the iPhone asked for too much power during some operation, therefore experienced an unexpected shutdown, therefore iOS will thereafter, unless you disable it again in the same Battery health screen, run in throttled mode, so as to not have the same thing happen again.\n", "Q: Is there a Quick Look plugin to view the text contents of any file with any extension Is there a Quick Look plugin to see the contents of any text file with any extension instead of just showing the icon.\n\nA: \nIs there a Quick Look plugin to see the contents of any text file with any extension instead of just showing the icon.\n\nThe short answer is “no.”\nCan you develop quick look plugins?  Of course you can!  However, things fall short with the requirement of any text file with any extension.\nFiles types and their associations, like what to open it with, what to edit it with and even what icon to show are all handled by LaunchServices.  The problem with “any file/any extension” is there’s no way to associate that with a particular quick view plugin.  For example which plugin would be associated with the shell script I wrote called foobar and the binary data file barfoo both with no extension?  Not all “no extension” files are of the the same type; in your case, text.\nYou can get more information regarding LaunchServices from the Development Guide\n\nA: There are quick look plugins that you can use to have the right app be used for quick look. These are stored in Library/Quicklook and ~Library/Quicklook. To view these files right-click on them and select View Contents. There is a repository of Quick Look plugins located here.. These can be easily installed manually. There is a more thorough description of this at this link. There are instructions to build a Quick Look plugin here.\n\nA: I use Sublime Text so I picked some extension-less files &:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click > Get info.\n\n*Open with \"Sublime Text\" & change all.\n\n\nThen sublime handles it for all the files that it can read through. Be careful with executable/ scripts though. Don't double click on them. A new kMDItemContentType can ditch you there.\nFor other files with recognised extensions, .php, .py etc, you'd have to change them individually, per format. \n", "Q: Mac Mini 2018 which memory bank is which?

Will they work or there is some kind of protection that will block the system? Are there any pitfalls?\n\nA: To save any potential issues with firmware changes over the years, make sure the new Mac is running the same or newer macOS as the old one was.\nMojave, for instance installed a firmware update to many machines at the time. I'm not certain this would cause any real issues if it wasn't present, but it would save any uncertainty.\nOnce you've done that, then yes - as the Mini Server is pre-T2 security - you should be able to simply swap out the drives with no ill-effects whatsoever.\nif you have an external UDB dock that would take your system HD & the new machine's 750GB SSD, I'd consider using something like Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the HD to SSD, for the added speed. \n", "Q: How to make APFS option available in disk utility?

If you can visit an Apple Store, they can help you test it.\nBut you've already done the most important test -- tried two identical model chargers with the same laptop and got different results. One other test you might want to try is pairing your charger with your friend's laptop. Another test is swapping cables only. \n", "Q: How to connect Macbook Pro 2015 and 2 x Dell U2518D monitors I bought 2 x  Dell U2518D monitors to use with my 2015 Macbook pro 13\". This is a 2560x1440 1440p monitor.  All the forums said this could be done and that they were compatible, but I didn't check the dell driver page.  When I did check the page, there were no macbook drivers. \nWhen I plugged the firs monitor in, nothing happened. It just went to sleep, said no HDMI input found.   This has never happened before with any other external monitor.\nDo I need mac drivers? \nI have the USB cable plugged into a USB port.\nI have the HDMI cable plugged into the mDP.\nI also bought the DELl 6000 universal docking station.  Not yet tried this, I thought I should be able to plug the monitor straight into the macbook.\nI'm not really very techy, clearly. Please be helpful.\nThanks.\n\nA: No, you do not need Mac drivers for this monitor to function.\nI think the problem is your cable. I would suggest using the cable that came with the monitor to connect the laptop and the display. That cable is a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. If this is actually the cable you've used (and not HDMI as you mention), then try getting an alternative cable to test with.\nAll you need to do is to plug that cable into the laptop and the monitor, and you should get a picture. You might need to set the input on the monitor to Mini DisplayPort if you have disabled the auto function.\nIf that fails to work with a good cable, try rebooting the laptop with the cable plugged in. That should definitely not be necessary, but just to test out every option.\n", "Q: Stuck on boot loop after upgrading iPhone SE 10.3.3 to 13.3.1 via iTunes I have an iPhone SE. It was running iOS 10.3.3, and I finally made the jump and upgraded to iOS 13.3.1 via iTunes. My computer is running Sierra so I'm only on iTunes 12.8.2.3 if it's relevant. Since I have slow internet and couldn't rely on iTunes to do the large download of iOS, I used ipsw.me to find the iPhone_4.0_64bit_13.3.1_17D50_Restore.ipsw file from Apple for my phone model and used iTunes to install this after downloading. Everything was going fine until the end where iTunes wanted me to allow it to access the iPhone, but it timed out waiting for the iPhone to actually boot. And eventually it seemed like it was going to boot, but then it kept rebooting. I can't stop it. I've tried forcing a reboot already. It also does not show up in iTunes when plugging it in. It gets to the point where the screen slightly dims on the boot screen to show my custom brightness while still on the Apple logo and sometimes even has a little [Zoom enabled] heads up thing that shows up briefly near the end, but then it just reboots again.\nHelp?\nEdit: I can try putting my phone in DFU mode, but then iTunes will want to wipe and restore from backup and redownload iOS 13.3.1. Losing data and re-downloading are both not desirable, but is there any other option?\nEdit 2: I was able to move the ipsw file into the iTunes library, so it didn't need to do any re-downloading. However, after being in DFU mode for a little while as iTunes is in the process of 'Extracting software...', my iPhone started the boot-loop again. iTunes still says it's extracting though. Is that normal? A way to fix?\nEdit 3: After it extracted software, it couldn't find the phone (which was still rebooting). Help?\nEdit 4: While connected to my Mac, I held down the power and home button to force a reboot and just continued holding until I got a new screen, the restore screen where it says on the iPhone screen to plug it into the computer. At that point iTunes said it needed to install iOS 13.3.1 and erase all my data on the phone. So I let it try, currently extracting software 'Verifying updated iPhone software...'. And I'm just hoping that now that it's in recovery mode and not DFU mode it will keep from rebooting and allow iTunes to work its software.\nEdit 5: It reinstalled, and is back into a boot loop! What could it be? I do think my battery health may be about 80% of its design capacity, but other than that I don't know what could be wrong.\nWould there be any chance that it would be happy using it for installing but still be some kind of problem and that I shouldn't use a newly downloaded copy of iOS downloaded directly by iTunes? Or even go so far as to get a Windows virtual machine going with a newer copy of iTunes in case 12.8.2.3 is too old? I'm kind of grasping at straws here.\nEdit 6: Not sure if when I did the recovery mode installation if it was trying an update or a restore. I'm trying again choosing 'restore' this time.\nEdit 7: 'Restore' made a difference! It brought me to the activation login and then asked me if I wanted to restore from a backup in iTunes while my phone still displayed a loading bar. I selected the backup, my phone booted to a screen that said 'restore in progress', and iTunes is telling me to wait about 8 minutes. Hoping this works.\n\nA: Not sure whether this is the best answer, but as I more or less got my issue ultimately resolved, I'll describe what I did. DFU mode did not prevent a boot-loop, but restore mode did, which I was only able to enter by holding the power and home buttons continuously while it was plugged into my Mac. iTunes then wanted to install the latest version of iOS, and I had to install it by choosing to restore from a backup rather than trying to install it as an upgrade. This worked, and then it restored from my iTunes backup. Eventually it rebooted, which took longer than normal but not more than a few minutes, and iTunes got right to syncing my music and podcasts.\nUnfortunately, having to re-download all my apps over my internet connection was not desirable, especially considering that I intentionally did not update certain apps, but this is better than a boot loop.\nOne hitch that happened was that on the new welcome screen on my phone, it didn't accept my Apple ID login/password, even though it worked initially within iTunes itself. But it let me skip that step and nevertheless seemed to be signed in to iCloud in iOS anyway.\n", "Q: Problem: forward selected emails to predefined addresses I run a small company and recieve invoices by mail as pdf attachments. I use Mail. I want to be able to forward these mails with invoice attached to two prespecified email adresses and a few prespecified sentences in the body. I would have loved to just press a keyboard combination for the whole action to take place, instead of having to push \"Forward\", type in the addresses and body text and then push \"Send\". \nI am new to Automator and AppleScript, have no coding experience, but I have tried different solutions including Automator, Rules within Mail and Applescript, but with no luck. Is there a way to do this task easy by simply using a keybord combination or a button in Mail? \n\nA: I came up with a solution that I think may be a good option for you. This following AppleScript code is a folder action that will ultimately be attached to a folder of your choice (the folder in which you will download the PDF invoice that was sent to you in the email). Basically, the concept is, when you save the PDF invoice in your email to the specified folder, it will trigger the folder action which will take that PDF file and use it as an attachment to the new outgoing emails which will be sent to the email addresses that you set in the AppleScript code.  In Script Editor.app, paste this following AppleScript code into a new document.  Assuming your forward to email addresses will always be the same and the subject and body content text will also always be the same, you will only need to change the variable values for forwardToRecipients , theSubject , and theContent one time only.  Anyway once you change those values to your liking, save that AppleScript document as a .scpt file and name it something like “Forward Email Attachment.scpt”… to your /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions folder. Once it is saved to that location it will always be available to choose in your Folder Actions Setup dialogue. (which can easily be accessed by right clicking on any folder in Finder app then selecting Services/Folder Actions Setup…)\non adding folder items to theFolder after receiving theNewItem\n    -- Insert Valid Forwarding Email Address \n    set forwardToRecipients to {\"address1@gmail.com\", \"address2@gmail.com\"}\n    -- Insert Your Desired Subject Text\n    set theSubject to \"Subject Text Blah Blah Blah\"\n    -- Insert Desired Body Content Text\n    set theContent to \"Text Text\" & linefeed & \"Text Text And More Text\" & linefeed & linefeed\n\n    set mailAttachment to POSIX path of theNewItem\n\n    tell application \"Mail\"\n        activate\n        repeat with i from 1 to count of forwardToRecipients\n            set thisItem to item i of forwardToRecipients\n            tell (make new outgoing message)\n                set subject to theSubject\n                set content to theContent\n                make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:thisItem}\n                make new attachment with properties {file name:(POSIX file mailAttachment)} at after last paragraph\n                delay 5\n                send\n            end tell\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend adding folder items to\n\nAfter that is all set up and ready to go, all you need to do now is attach the folder action to the folder where are you will be downloading the PDF invoices from your emails to.\n\n\n", "Q: Recommend a Terminal app for iOS? Can anyone recommend a terminal emulator for iOS 13.3.1?\nI’m kinda green to the whole thing to be completely honest! So any extra advice would be wonderful!\n\nA: I use Prompt 2 by Panic. It's an excellent terminal app / SSH client, and works on the iPad too (in fact, it's even better on the iPad).\nHowever, it's not free.\n\nA: Personally, I prefer apps that are cross platform so that I don't have to \"learn\" different apps on different devices.\nOnce such App is Termius.  There's a free tier, as well as a \"pro\" tier that allows you to sync across devices regardless of OS.  It supports iOS, macOS, Windows, Android and Linux. \nDisclaimer:  I don't use it on macOS because I prefer iTerm2 there, but I do use it on my iOS and Windows devices and (reluctantly when I have to) on Android devices. \n\nA: I use openTerm myself. I use this to bring up the command line on my iPad. OpenTerm is $3.99 on the App Store. A free app is LibTerm also available on the App Store. These allow you to access the file system on the iPad among other things. You can also send commands to your iPad. I would suggest using LibTerm to see if it does what you want. It's hard to give more advice without knowing more about what you hope to accomplish.\n\nA: Get your own local terminal with LibTerm\nFor network ssh use Prompt\nI would expect some very specific requirements if another than these apps would be the best recommended apps in 2020. \n", "Q: Using night shift/f.lux on external monitors Mac OS 10.15 I’m having an issue using Night Shift, f.lux, or any blue light filter application on 2 of the 3 external monitors I have hooked up to my MacBook Pro via a Dell docking station.

That said, I don't see any cache on any system I have, neither server-oriented systems nor end-user laptops.\nSee man dscacheutil for more.\nDenis' answer via the comment will let you see lookups as they happen, but the DNS cache is very short lived if present at all.\nIs there an actual problem at hand?\n", "Q: Workaround for Dell's lack of drivers for macOS 10.15 Catalina? I've got two Dell printers - a C1760nw color printer and a B1165nfw Mono MFP.\nBoth of which are currently unusable after the upgrade to macOS 10.15 Catalina. Is anyone aware of a workaround or non-Dell drivers that I could use while Dell clings to their non-apologetic \"circumstances beyond our control\" refrain ...?\n\nA: The one-stop-shop for open source print drivers is here:\nhttp://www.openprinting.org/printers\nModels similar to your Dells seem to be supported. \nIf the printers can interpret PostScript or PDF natively, then you should be able to get by with a 'Generic' print queue.

It would be passed something like myapp:<base64 params> and this would need to open the app.\nCurrently, I have a setup somewhat like this (I'm mostly a Windows developer and haven't really touched Mac at all, Linux I'm more familiar with but still not comfortable working in):\n\n\n*\n\n*URL launches .app which contains AppleScript\n\n*AppleScript launches\na shell script which forks the dotnet MyApp.dll $1 command into a\nnew process\n\n*MyApp.dll launches with the parameter supplied\n\n\nThe issue with this seems to be the AppleScript launcher, as when launching the shell script manually with params the app opens and functions normally. But when launching the URL from a browser (Chrome) the icon appears and quickly disappears in the dock, and the program does not execute. I have no idea how to debug something like this since I've never properly worked with a Mac and I don't know if there's an event viewer or something of the like (usually checking the event viewer would be my step 1 on Windows).\nThe scripts I'm using:\nAppleScript (which then gets made into a .app using the built-in exporter):\non open location this_URL\n    do shell script \"/Library/MyApp/Launcher \" & this_URL\nend open location\n\nI edited the Info.plist for the generated .app to add the Custom URL handler:\n...\n<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n        <string>com.myapp.urlhandler</string>\n        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>myapp</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n...\n\nThe shell script (without sh extension) that is used to launch the dll:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n( ( ( dotnet /Library/MyApp/AppFiles/MyApp.dll $1 ) & ) & )\n\n\nSide Note: The shell script forks once more than should be necessary, but without the extra fork it breaks .NET for some reason. Also adding the & after the $1 seems to cause issues with .NET's argument handling.\nI have checked that all the files are in the right places, and when cutting out the AppleScript it runs normally, but I'm not sure how to debug the AppleScript issues. I did have it working before where the AppleScript would directly launch the dll, but that caused a console window which would kill the app when closed, and trying to fork in there didn't seem to work.\nIs there a better way of doing this or a workaround that I can use to launch the app from a custom URL without the shell and/or AppleScript bits?\nUPDATE: Solved as per my answer below. SE won't let me accept it until 2 days time.\n\nA: So as it would turn out, Apple doesn't like you having multiple copies of an app as backups.\nUsually when I'm doing this kind of executable/package work, I keep backups, such as BAK1_Package.exe, BAK2_Package.exe, etc.\nIt seems that if you have more than one .app that's registered to a URL handler anywhere on your system then Mac uses one of those, and not specifically the one that's in the Applications folder. So when I tried to launch the URL, instead of launching the most recent .app that was placed inside the Applications folder, it was launching the first one that was in the _BACKUP folder on my desktop.\nFor anyone else who runs into a similar issue like this: make sure you only have one .app registered to that URL handler.\n", "Q: How to view local user password in Terminal? I have the administrators password and account but I am interested in finding the password of a local user. I am not trying to reset the password but find out the exact password that was already set. I also encounter problems with finding the password in the terminal because if I ever do find a password,It is usually encrypted and does not work when copy-pasted onto the password box.\n\nA: The passwords are stored in a salted hash, so there is no way to just read them.\nIf you want to crack the password, here is a guide from a few years ago, it still works.\nIf you need access to the files in the User profile and you have admin access, you can just change the permissions in finder or using chmod in the terminal.

The sudo'd command runs fine, but this error shows every time.\nI don't have any plugins or modifications to my shell - it's vanilla ZSH in default Terminal.app\nI've searched the Googs but I can't really find anything that seems like a good match - only generic \"increasing limits on sockets in osx\".

What will happen? See the picture.\n\n\nA: Nothing will happen.\nYou are not directly connecting anything from the mains side of the power adapter to the USB side of things.  The low voltage side (USB) actually isolated from the high voltage side.  The highest amount of voltage being passed is +/- 5V which is more of a data sense connection.  It’s looking to see if there is a device making a request to be charged.  Since power adapters don’t make this request by design, it will never send higher voltage. \nNow, it's not fair to say absolutely nothing will happen as it's conceivable that you might blow the USB controller (the chip that does the negotiation). However I would bet that the engineers designed the circuitry to be one way only. I don’t have access to the schematics, but I would bet there are diodes on the 5V connection’s to ensure a one way connection - they are there on the older MagSafe adapters so it only makes sense they would still be there on the newer  USB adapters (see above link)\nFrom a pragmatic point of view, engineers would design to accommodate this sort of behavior - they design things to fail safe to the user not fail to protect itself.  That said, don’t do it because the shock you'll get is the one that comes from having to replace two previously perfectly good power adapters. \n\nA: This is a bad idea and you should not do it. This creates a physical connection between sockets which opens the potential for damage or danger.\nThat being said, it's likely that nothing will happen. Both USB-C chargers here follow the USB Power Delivery standard, and will only send or receive power after communicating with the device on the other end of the cable. They should detect the dangerous configuration and do nothing. But you're depending on these two adapters working ideally so that you avoid starting a fire. It's just not worth it. \n", "Q: How to add a confirmation prompt window to warn before closing a window for any application? This is about adding a Warn-Before-Closing Confirmation Dialog Window to all application windows in macOS before closing a window. \nHow do I add a Confirmation Dialog Window when I click the Red X close circle button in the top left corner of a application window to warn me before closing a window? This is basically what Firefox has or at least it had it when I used it a couple years ago, but I would want this applied to every single application window that has an X button for closing that window. When you would click the X button for a window in Firefox with multiple tabs open and try to close that window it would state and ask the following: \"You are about to close 83 tabs. Are you sure you want to continue?\"\nThis is a picture of the FireFox warn-before-closing confirmation dialog window I was talking about.\n\nI want to add a confirmation dialog window like that for any and all application/program windows because I sometimes accidentally press the red x close circle button to close a window. When I click or press that red x close circle button to close a window for any reason intentionally or unintentionally, especially by accident, I want a confirmation dialog window to appear confirming whether or not I really want to close it. \nAgain, I would want this Warn-Before-Closing Confirmation Dialog Window to appear when the Red X Circle Close button is clicked before Closing ANY macOS application window. \nAgain, how it works is after I would click on a Red X circle close button to close a window, a prompt would appear asking if I am sure I want to close that specific window for that specific app. I would have to click on the \"Close\" button in the prompt window, highlighted in blue, to confirm to successfully close that specified window. \nHere are a few examples featuring a few apps of how I would want it to look and work upon clicking the Red X circle close button to warn me before closing a window for every macOS application window:\n\n\n\nI would want this close confirmation prompt window to warn me before closing a window for EVERY macOS application, not just the ones I showed in the examples. \nTo clarify, I am pretty sure this would be applied system-wide, not to any one specific app or program, but rather to ALL applications/programs for every application/program window that is attempted to be closed.  \nLet me know if I would need to update to the latest version of macOS to do this. Or if I can use the older version of macOS High Sierra that I have installed on my computer.\nDoes anyone know if this is possible? Thank you. \n\nA: You clearly know what you want, and that is great, but you might have a hard time convincing other people to make it for you to your exact specifications.\nSafari on macOS does not have any scripting hooks you can use to prevent closing any Safari window with the red button, so it won't be trivial to make Safari do what you want.\nOne possible avenue to consider is writing a webpage that intercepts the window close event to install a custom behaviour. This might be satisfactory, depending on exactly what problem you're trying to solve.\nIf you're not totally set on using Safari, you could try developing an extension for Firefox that implements the behaviour you want. I don't actually know for sure if that is possible.\nYou could try visiting the Mozilla Forums and submitting a feature request to have your feature added to Firefox core, but it is extremely unlikely that anybody will listen and add your feature.\nIf you want this badly enough that you're willing to pay money for it, you could try putting out an offer on a marketplace for freelance programmers (like Fiverr) and maybe somebody can help you create this feature that is very important to you. \n", "Q: How can I switch between language input sources using Alt-Shift on Catalina?

So I got this iMac from auction, as is. The iMac chimes when I press the start button but the screen remains black. Is it possible that the iMac chimes if it has no CPU? I just wanna make sure if the iMac indeed has the CPU because I noticed missing screws on the front screen. I did not disassemble the logic board as I never done it. So is it possible to not have a CPU and still have the iMac play a chime when it boots up?\n\nA: No, there will be no boot-up chime (an EFI ROM tone) if the CPU is missing. The chime only plays if the power-on self test completes successfully, which is impossible without a CPU. \n", "Q: Solution for logging into PC with macbook, using PC speakers to play music We have a Windows 10 PC that is connected to our sound system. I would like to be able to log into that PC from my MacBook (High Sierra) and play music, either off of the (PC) hard drive or from an online service (Deezer).\nEssentially, I would be using the MacBook only for its keyboard and screen.\nThe reason is that the PC does not have its own screen but is instead connected to a projector, and turning this on just to change a song is very obtrusive. \nThe solution I'm looking for does not have to be free but must be secure.\nI have tried the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client but it will only play sounds off of my MacBook speakers.\n\nA: In my experience, the performance and quality of Microsoft's Remote Desktop (free) is the best in the industry.  This isn't a personal preference but rather a trial and error using many other remote desktop apps.\nIn short... \nUsing Microsoft Remote Desktop 10 or higher, there should be a new option to play music on the remote machine.  Once toggled, I believe you'll get what you're looking for.. This is accessible through the + icon (new connection) or the ✏️ icon (existing connection).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*As an aside, there are some nuances to using RDP, some of which are shortcuts.  I would love the option to disable ⌘ + w, ⌘ + q as I tend to hit them on accident intending Ctrl + w, etc... but it'll only close the RDP session, not the stuff that's running on the remote machine.\n\n\nThe long...\nDisclaimer: The solutions below may look subjective, but they're objectively evaluated for the requirement of 1. Free or not free.  2. Secure.  3. Play sounds on the remote computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*VNC: (free and commercial) Comes in many variants (macOS built-in, TightVNC, UltraVNC, etc). Offers secure and insecure options.\nPerformance is the worst I've used but is viable on a very fast network.\n\n*Splashtop: Secure.  Cloud-based so you can get to it anywhere.  Performance is better than VNC.  Requests are routed through the cloud, so can be slower than other solutions on a LAN.  Linux support is still experimental\n\n*GoToMeeting, WebEx, AnyDesk, etc: Online meeting apps are great (performance, options, audio), but often contain tools designed for group voice conversations (dedicated phone number, etc), making remote access a toggleable feature, not ideal hoops to jump through each for a dedicated remote desktop.\n\n*TeamViewer (free and commercial): Secure.  Great quality, speed.  Universal solution on Linux, Windows, macOS.  Cloud-based so may perform worse than LAN-driven solutions like RDP and VNC, however in my experience out-performs VNC.\n\n*Microsoft RDP (free): Secure.  Performs best when connecting to a Windows machine.  Historically LAN-driven, but Azure's rise in success makes it more attractive over WAN too (popular choice for Windows Server).  Performance, speed and quality are the best if a Windows machine is what's being connected to.\n\n\n*\n\n*RDP even has support for streaming content and some compositing, which is very nice for video playback as well as for a curated Windows 7+ compositioned desktop experience (thumbnailing, transparency, etc).\n\n\n\nFor your needs I believe RDP is the way to go, especially since they've offered the option to keep audio routed through the Windows machine, which wasn't available back in Remote Desktop 8.\n", "Q: Which Macs support macOS internet recovery? I know that all modern Macs support internet recovery, but I'm not quite sure how far back that started. How can I tell if internet recovery is supported on a specific model? And when was this feature introduced for each computer in Apple's product lineup?\nI'm specifically asking about internet recovery that does not depend on the built-in recovery partition.\n\nA: Mac computers have had this ability since around 2012.\nWorks out of box\nOne of the earliest Mac laptops to support this by default was the MacBook Pro Mid-2012 (MacBookPro9,2).\nWith a firmware upgrade\nA few Macs from 2010 and 2011 can have their firmware upgraded so that they gain support for internet recovery.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011) \n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) \n\n*MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) \n\n*iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) \n\n*iMac (27-inch, Mid 2011) \n\n*MacBook (13-inch, Mid 2010)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010)\n\n*Mac mini (Mid 2010)\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch and 17-inch, Mid 2010)\n\n*iMac (21.5-inch and 27-inch, Mid 2010)\n\n*MacBook Air (11-inch and 13-inch, Late 2010)\n\n", "Q: Which utilities are available during Internet Recovery?

Does it depend on model or model year?\n\nA: Yes, All the tools(Disk Utility & Firmware Password) are available when you are booting through internet recovery.While normal recovery keeps a copy of your currently running(Updated) macOS and Internet Recovery will restore to by default macOS to which version comes with your Mac.\n", "Q: MacOS install USB not listed in boot manager on startup I have a 2011 Macbook Air (a1370) that was stuck on the boot screen with the spinning wheel. \nI booted into internet recovery and from Disk Utility wiped the SSD clean. When I then tried to reinstall Lion through recovery, I kept getting the error \"Can't download the additional components needed to install Mac OS X.\" Avoiding this error, I made an install USB with TransMac and attempted to boot from that, but there are no drives listed, including the internal SSD. \nI have tried to reset NVRAM  but that did not work.

I'm not really sure what to do from here.\nWeird time estimate\n\nInitial error\n\nInstall USB partition\n\nNo bootable partitions\n\n\nA: I finally was able to borrow a friends Macbook and created the installation drive there. It turns out that was the issue, and it booted fine my next attempt. I suppose the error in recovery was independent to my Macbook Air and just needed a reinstall. Because TransMac did not work on different computers, MacOS's, and TransMac versions, I can conclude that creating MacOS installation media via this method does not work.]\nUpdate:\nI received a second Macbook Air and got the same error in the OSX Lion recovery. This might be an internet problem and it wouldn't due harm to check try a different connection. \n", "Q: How to get photos from my phone to my mac as quickly as possible? Right now, the answer would be airdrop as far as I am concerned.\nI would just take a photo and press the share button and then wait for my laptop to come up.\nHowever, I have an older phone and I find the share button to be quite slow to use.\nAre there any apps or such that would allow me to take photos and send them to a folder on my mac without having to press anything?\n\nA: Airdrop is best solutions for that but it's seems your MacBook unable to detect your iPhone because it's older version.\nHowever in your MacBook there has an option under Airdrop like \"Search for older device\" you can use this option for older device to transfer your photos or you can use Image capture(through spotlight search)\n\nA: Surely iCloud is the answer? Either use My Photo Stream, which acts as a conduit from your phone to other devices, but doesn't store the photos long-term, or iCloud Photo Library, which does.\nOr just connect your phone via USB and launch the Image Capture app, and transfer whatever you want.\n", "Q: Select the save format in the Save As dialog by using AppleScript How do I select the output format in the Save As dialog of Mail.app? I know how to change the file name by using keystroke but I could not figure out how to change the file format in AppleScript.\n\n\nA: Assuming Mail has focus and the Save As sheet is showing, then the following example AppleScript code would click the Format: pop up menu and select e.g.: Plain Text\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Mail\"\n        tell sheet 1 of window 1\n            tell pop up button 2\n                click\n                click menu item \"Plain Text\" of menu 1\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nYou can also use the menu item number, e.g. click menu item 3 of menu 1\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: My final scrip is as follows.\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n\n        tell process \"Mail\"\n            keystroke \"s\" using {command down, shift down}\n            delay 1\n            keystroke \"g\" using {command down, shift down}\n            delay 1\n            keystroke \"/tmp/purchase.rtf\"\n            click button \"Go\" of sheet 1 of sheet 1 of the front window\n            click pop up button 2 of sheet 1 of the front window\n            click menu item \"Rich Text Format\" of menu 1 of pop up button 2 of sheet 1 of the front window\n            click button \"Save\" of sheet 1 of the front window\n            try\n                click UI element \"Replace\" of sheet 1 of sheet 1 of the front window\n            end try\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\n", "Q: Catalina is in Turkish but some apps are in Russian I have a MBA and the language is in Turkish.

How can I stop this behaviour?\n\nA: If your app includes an English localization, you can get this to display by going to System Preferences > Language and Region and making sure that English is the second item on the list of Preferred Languages, right after Turkish.  Input Sources preferences are irrelevant for your problem.\n", "Q: Why is my MacBook Pro beeping when performing a keyboard shortcut? When using any keyboard shortcut in any application, there is a beeping sound effect that is normally played when there is an error. However, the keyboard shortcut still works normally. I am using macOS Mojave 10.14.6.\n\nA: On your Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Sound, then click Sound Effects.\nFind the alert sound that is causing the issue.  When you click on it, it will play the sound effect.  In my case, every time I used the keyboard shortcut cmd-shift-p - even though it was a valid shortcut in some apps - it made the alert sound from \"Ping\".   I muted the Output volume for \"Ping\" and that solved the issue.\n\nA: It has just happened to me as well.\nFor me, it turned out that a specific app (VPN) has blocked the input from my keyboard. When I  closed the app, the keyboard immediately returned to work properly (no reset was required).\nTry to close apps that start-up with your Mac, perhaps one of them is taking control over your input.\n\nA: Restarting the Dock fixed it for me.\nOpen up Activity Monitor, locate the Dock process, and Quit the dock.\n\nA: It appears that this sort of issue can easily be caused by a glitched application reacting to the input. It doesn't have to be foreground for this to occur. Most recent example happening to me was telegram's save dialog left in the background. It caused beeps to occur with use of the cmd key and use of the space bar in other applications, as well as preventing QuickLook from closing a window once it was opened.\nDiving this sort of issue in the past has been as follows :\nCheck open applications, restart, possibly test vs a fresh 'test' user account if it persists to rule out items unique to your user account.\nCheck and possibly reset the shortcuts in system preferences.\nExamine anything installed for all users as a culprit.\nMove on to removable hardware.\n\nA: I have the same issue with FortiClient. I have to close it/restart it to get it to work.\nPrior to my understanding that it was an issue with FortiClient, I used to restart my Mac every time.\n", "Q: How to re-enable sounds for calendar notifications? I have my work Exchange account syncing with the default Mac OS Calendar app. Until recently, this worked very well and I would get notifications (with sound) for forthcoming events.\nFor the last week or so, the notification sound has vanished. I still get pop-up notifications at the right time, but no sound.\nMy exchange account presents three calendars: \"Calendar\", \"Birthdays\" and \"United Kingdom holidays\". Interestingly, the holidays calendar showed an alert today and there was a sound! So the problem is limited to my 'Calendar' Exchange calendar.\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've looked in Notifications in System Preferences and ensured Calendar has \"Play sound for notifications\" enabled. I've also tried disabling and re-enabling this, to no avail.\n\n*I've looked in Sound in System Preferences and ensured alert volume is set appropriately. I've also got \"Play sound effects through\" set to MacBook Speakers.\n\n*Based on an answer below, I've tried removing the Exchange account from my Mac and re-adding it. No change.\n\n*I'm running Catalina 10.15.13 on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports).\n\n\nHere are the alert settings within Calendar:\n\nAny suggestions for how to resolve this?\n\nA: I've been dealing with Exchange/mail.app on iOS issues at my company for years and the only reliable way to deal with this problem is one of two ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the Exchange account from your iOS device and re-add it. Since everything on Exchange is kept on the server you will lose nothing but the time it takes to do this.\n\n*Move your Exchange-based email account(s) to (the free) MS Outlook app for iOS.\n\n\nBoth of these seem like unfortunate choices, but both work. The Outlook email client is actually pretty good and (for me) allows me to keep my work and personal emails completely separate.\nThe issue with Exchange and mail.app not syncing up properly from time to time (and other, ahem..., issues) is an ongoing issue that (I have heard but cant find the source to cite) MS Blames on Apple and vice-versa. So there is no actual fix for the problem. Deleting the Exchange account for mail.app forces it to re-sync everything and (9 times out of 10) will fix the issue. Until it happens again, which is one of the reasons I migrated my work email to the outlook.app from MS.\n\nIf someone has discovered a permanent fix for this I would love to hear about it as it would save me that in-person interaction with (yet another) user and a lot of wasted time fiddling with it. So far it still exists on iOS 13.\n\nA: \nSystem Preferences -> Notifications -> Calendar\n\nA: For me, the problem was in alert configuration. There were no events enabling at all. To fix this I just ran through all my accounts here and set them desired events settings and these settings were applied to all existing events.\nHope this will help.\n\n\nA: I just found the answer here and it worked in Mojave.\nSelect Custom... in the dropdown\n\nAnd the option Message with sound appears:\n\nOn my system, it doesn't show any indicator the alert will have sound, but the notification will play a system sound.\nWhat I haven't found is how to customize witch sound plays, though.

Unfortunately in Catalina I just see \"Safari\".\nHow else can I determine which tab(s) is/are the main culprit? \n\nA: From comments…\nIn Activity Monitor, if you set the View to \"All Processes, Hierarchically\" then all sub-processes of Safari [or anything] will be contained within the main process, aiding the task of discovery.\n", "Q: SMB connection to external Thunderbolt drive not working in MacOS Catalina After upgrading to macOS Catalina, I can no longer connect to one SMB drive from my MacBook Pro with MacOS Mojave.

I would like to know if I can add GPU and power supply unit from my old 27\" iMac 2010.\nI noticed that the brand for display for both the models are similar as they both are manufactured by LG. The LVDS connector for both the displays are different. However the power supply cables that the LCD connects to the PSU unit is the same.

Should we close open applications before restarting a MacBook Pro with macOS Catalina? Or is it okay to be lazy and restart it without closing them?\n\nA: Most applications from Apple, and some others, will save state and restart properly.  Some will cause a pop-up saying \"Application XYZ has canceled logout; quit and try again.\"  (Not exact words.)  Then if you're on \"autopilot.\" you close the lid and when you next open it, it's still there.  \nTo clarify that last confusing statement: Several times, I order \"shutdown but re-open apps\" and came back later to find it had not shut down because some application had asked me to do something and that canceled shutdown.\nLibreOffice will come back up saying documents need to be recovered (and any edits immediately before shutdown will be lost).  GraphicConverter 10 comes up OK but sometimes fails to find the images it had open before.  You'd have to experiment with others.\nI've gotten to the point where I close everything but Finder windows, Safari, and TextEdit before I shut down.\n\nA: The Resume Feature, as far as I know, should still take into effect if you have the \"Reopen Windows When logging back in\" option check-marked in the restart window. It's the feature that reopens all windows and apps that you had open in your last session before you logged out and restarted your computer. So, yes it should normally be safe to restart and have all that you had open before restarting, back up and open again as soon as you log back in. \n", "Q: Installing GNU compilers on PureDarwin/Darwin? I hope this is not off-topic, because there is no better place to ask this sort of questions on SO/SE. I have Downloaded and ran PureDarwin on QEMU using instructions here:\n\n                    \n\nNow I want to know if there are any package managers? Can I install HomeBrew preferably here for example or even MacPorts? If none possible how can I install GNU C/C++/Fortran compilers (GCC/g++/gfortran) here? or if it is not a possibility is there any compiler on this operating system at all? My goal is eventually to provide some Open Source developers who don't have macs with an alternative to test their software or maybe create macOS compatible binaries/packages if possible. Thanks for your support in advance.\n\nA: Your link is broken to the instructions.\nFYI, the point of macOS is, to a large degree, the fact that it IS a walled garden. Having control over the entire hardware and software stack lets Apple provide a seamless, polished service and products at a premium cost.\nAs far as Homebrew goes, as a maintainer, I have zero optimism that it will work at all, unless the Linux version can be coerced to get installed and/or run, then maybe it could work (no promises) but will likely require a lot of time compiling things. Normal Homebrew (on macOS) checks for Xcode CLT and other very macOS specific stuff that won't be present in Pure Darwin. I think Homebrew on Linux will also fail because it looks for Linux headers, etc.\nNo matter what, this is an unsupported configuration for Homebrew and I'm 99% sure it won't work, but would be curious to learn where it fails.\nI would assume/guess PureDarwin has some sort of package manager, or a package manager planned?

So the certificate issue is solved.\nIf so you should download the macOS App onto a current Mac Model fresh from AppStore and create a macOS-USB-Stick from the newer Mac, this should solve your issue with the AppStore Authentication, so you will be able to run the installation on your older Mac.\n\nA: Change the date of the machine to near the date of the installer, say the last day of the year of the installer.\nI did that just yesterday to install High Sierra on a 2010 MacBook Pro. I think my installer was 17G65 dated July 2018 and so I changed the date of the machine to December 31, 2018.\n", "Q: Show FaceTimeNotificationCenterService I wonder how I can show FaceTimeNotificationCenterService again if I run the command killall -kill FaceTimeNotificationCenterServicebefore?\n\nA: For the next call, the notification should appear again.

I tried to install Citrix Workspace v2002 on a new MacBook Air running macOS 15 Catalina. I think the owner of the computer had used Migration Assistant from an old MacBook Air running a significantly older OS.\nThe installer failed without a user-facing explanation. Other versions of Citrix Workspace and Citrix Receiver also failed to install.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\nA: The installer log view showed that a File Not Found error was occurring in /private/tmp.\nInspecting directly, /tmp was a symlink to /private/tmp, which itself was a symlink to private/tmp, that is to say /private/private/tmp! This target did not exist. The erroneous symlink had a modification date in 2016, which made me suspect a problem relating to Migration Assistant.\nI think System Integrity Protection was preventing me from modifying /private/tmp, even as sudo and with System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Full Disk Access granted to Terminal.app . I didn't really want to disable it.\nIn the end I just created the missing target sudo mkdir -p /private/private/tmp and the installer worked.\nIt'd be nice to know how the erroneous symlink came into existence. The Migration Assistant theory is just a theory at this stage.\naddit\nProblem recurred while upgrading to macOS 10.15.4 (presenting with An error occurred while updating firmware.). Booted into recovery mode and inspected /Volumes/Macintosh HD/private/ to find that my ./private/tmp directory wasn't there any more.

I am not sure about the word 'dialog'. It is a just a small window just pops in the middle of the screen and disappears in a couple of seconds.\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different. \nYou could enable/set keyboard shortcuts for changing input sources.

To quick charge you need at least 18W or 3.6A of current.\n", "Q: Why does installing a package create a directory on my desktop? When I install a package, it creates a directory with the name of the package on my desktop. In Finder it looks like a new external drive:\n\nWhy is that? Should I always remove those drives after installation? Or did I do something wrong and this should not show up?\n\nA: This is normal.  These programs have been downloaded as virtual disk or .dmg files.\nFor example Mendeley Desktop is a program supplied as Mendeley-Desktop-1.19.4-OSX-Universal.dmg file.  When you open the downloaded file by default you will see it appear on your desktop and as a removable drive in Finder.\n\nOnce you have dragged the application to Applications you can eject the virtual disk in Finder and then delete the downloaded .dmg file.\nNote some programs - MS Office for example - are supplied as packages (files ending in .pkg) rather than .dmg files.  When you run this type the program is installed without mounting a virtual drive and macOS will automatically prompt you to delete the installer file once done.\n\nA: This is basically like if you had mounted a USB disk (or a CD Rom for older people) with the intaller on it. Hence the eject sign on the side. Once you're done installing, you can hit the eject button, that will \"unmount\" the drive. It should then disappear from where it was (in your case, the desktop).\n\nA: I suggest you go to Finder, View menu → Columns. Now Go menu → Computer. You should see what Macintosh HD is, what is inside it etc. Some folders deep you'll see the default/ main folders: Desktop, Downloads, Movies, Pictures etc. Unlike windows, Desktop is not at the top of hierarchy. \nAs for the three new \"dirs\", they are volumes, mounted to install new software; could also be used to share files etc. Such icon would also appear if you mount a pen drive.  They can be ejected as long as no other process is using them. \nThe icon you see at the desktop is a shortcut to the volume for easy access, after it is mounted. You can right click on it, select Get info and see its location. Most probably, it would be Downloads. \nJust be safe when downloading DMGs from the internet. Specially the ones who claim to be some software but then send an Adobe Flash installer. Open a dmg (not a .pkg), see its contents, and size and if anything is suspicious, eject it and delete it. \nFurther, don't give root passwords to unknown installers either. Unlike windows, there is no \"Run as administrator\" and in day to day usage, I don't need to use sudo much often. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Disk_Image\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installer_(macOS)\n\n*Why do we install software via `.dmg` files?\n\nA: \nWhy does installing a package create a directory on my desktop?\n\nThat's not a directory on your Desktop, but the icon for mounted disk image.\nAs the other answers have aptly mentioned, a lot of apps for macOS are distributed packaged in a disk image (typically a DMG file). Executing (by double-clicking or opening) a DMG file mounts the disk image, and it appears to users just how a mounted disk (external/internal hard drive, thumb-drive etc.) would appear in macOS.\nA mounted disk (which could be Mac's built-in hard drive, a connected external USB drive, network storage, or a DMG file) can appear in two places:\n\n\n*\n\n*User's Desktop.\n\n*Topmost level in Finder, under the Computer.\nThe visibility in the former case can be toggled to show/hide the mounted disk(s). You can do so by opening Finder Preferences (either from the Finder Menu → Preferences... or using the keyboard shortcut Command + ,).\nNow in the Finder Preferences window, select the General tab and check/uncheck the External disks item to show/hide the mounted DMG(s) from the Desktop.\n\nIrrespective of whether the External disk visibility is enabled on Desktop, they would always show under the topmost level in Finder under your computer. You can access the topmost level in Finder by using either one of the following three techniques:\nOpen a Finder window/tab, and:\n\n\n*\n\n*in the Sidebar, under the Locations item, click on your computer name (16\" MacBook Pro in the screenshot below).\n\n*use the keyboard shortcut, Command + Shift + C  to directly access the Computer.\n\n*keep invoking the keyboard shortcut Command + ↑ until you reach the topmost level and can see the mounted disk. (Once you reach the top-level) the keyboard shortcut won't work anymore.)\n\nAfter you have installed the app by copying the .app bundle from the disk, you can and should unmount it. You can unmount a DMG by using either one of the following techniques:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag and dropping the mounted disk icon from any of the two locations discussed above to the Trash in the Dock.\n\n*Clicking on the eject icon shown alongside the disk name in the Finder Sidebar (as shown in the screenshot above).\n\n*Clciking to select the mounted disk image icon and using the keyboard shortcut Command + E to eject.\nTo answer your specific questions:\n\nWhen I install a package, it creates a directory with the name of the package on my desktop. In Finder it looks like a new external drive:\nWhy is that?\n\nThe installer you downloaded comes in the form of a DMG file which gets mounted as an External drive. It gets shown on your Desktop, as Finder is by default configured to shown mounted External drives on your Desktop.\n\nShould I always remove those drives after installation?\n\nYes. Once you are done copying the .app bundle out of the disk image, you should ideally unmount the disk image and either backup the original DMG file for later re-installation of the app, or trash it.\n\nOr did I do something wrong and this should not show up?\n\nYou have not done anything wrong and this is by design. The answer above should give you clear explanation about the observed behavior and possible customizations.\n", "Q: How to sync fonts across Macbooks? Extended question I'm bouncing on a question posted here a while ago: How to sync fonts across Macbooks?\nThe question is about how to store all fonts on a cloud folder (i.e. Dropbox), and load these fonts on other Macs, using this cloud folder as a \"font repository\".\nUser ProGrammer had posted a great answer based on the following this blog post.\nI did this on my source computer and successfully moved my fonts to dropbox. I then plugged a map, and folloed these commands:\n\nDESTINATION MAC\n  (Any Mac you want to copy your Fonts folder to. NOTE: This will DELETE your user Fonts folder.)\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Launch Terminal in Applications/Utilities/\n  \n*Run cd ~/Library to open your user Library.\n  \n*Run sudo rm -r Fonts to delete your user fonts folder.\n  \n*Enter your password when prompted.\n  \n*Run ln -s ~/Dropbox/Fonts to create a symbolic link in your User Library.\n  \n\nPoint 5 is what I suspect tells the mac that my fonts are not in the Library/Fonts folder, but in the Dropbox/Fonts folder; here's what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*On my source Macbook, when i install a font, it properly goes to the Font Book, and the font file goes  Dropbox/Fonts folder\n\n*On my iMac though, when i install a font, absolutely nothing happens.

You can google for Markdown editors for macOS.\nI use MacDown, a free and lightweight Markdown editor for macOS, which shows the raw markdown and the HTML render side-by-side. The Markdown render gets updated in realtime as you edit the raw Markdown file.\n\nIf you prefer using command-line, you can install the original Markdown Perl script via Homebrew by running the following command:\nbrew install markdown\n\nOnce installed, you can quickly generate the HTML render of a README.md file by running the following command:\nmarkdown README.md > README.html\n\nWhich can be easily previewed in any Web browser.\nP.S.: In-fact, you can have a workflow where you have the Markdown file open in any text editor, Terminal open with the current directory changed to the one where the Markdown file is saved, and the HTML file, once generated, loaded into a Web browser.

That in itself is not a problem, we need to rent an Apple Computer for deployment anyway. My Question is, what happens when we disable 2-Factor Authentication and return the MacBook?\nI presume I would be no longer able to access the Developer Program, but does the Account itself keep running and the App stays in the AppStore, or am I simply not able to disable 2-Factor Authentication?\nYes, this is not an ideal situation but it is what it is.

It is not required to disable the 2FA on your Apple ID if you do not have any Apple device linked to your account.\nIn the absence of any trusted device(s) (Macs or iOS/iPadOS devices), you can add a trusted mobile number to your Apple ID account, and can receive 2FA codes via SMS.\n", "Q: How to uninstall LibreOffice from Mac OS Catalina? Can someone let me know how can I completely uninstall LibreOffice from Catalina ?\nI have moved LibreOffice under Applications to trash and removed the LibreOffice folder under /Library/ApplicationSupport/\nIs this the recommended way to remove LibreOffice?\n\nA: For any app that comes with an installer package, check to see if there is an uninstaller option. \nCheck with the developer, to ask what step they recommend for removing the app.\nOtherwise, for most apps, delete the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*the .app bundle from /Applications. \n\n*subfolders with the app's name in /Library/Application Support and\n<user>/Library/Application Support\nThere may be subfolders in the company's name, e.g. Adobe.\nIf you want to go mad, you can also look for folders with the app's name in other subfolders of the user Library:  Caches, Containers, LaunchAgents. They may be named as com.company.appname, or org.company.appname. \nThere may be files in <user>/Library/Preferences, of type com.company.appName.plist. Typically these will be only a few Kb, and if you miss them (or other small files in other places), they will do nothing but occupy one-hundred-millionth of the space your hard drive.\nEssentially, this is all that so-called 'cleaner' apps do: search for files with the app's name in your user Library. They can of course delete the wrong thing and miss obscurely named files just as easily as you can. \nOrphaned files left over will just sit on your hard drive and never be read. (Ahhhh.) They won't affect the running of your computer in any way.\n\nA: The AppCleaner App is a free solution for complete removal of macOS applications.\nBear in mind that every application has different caches and supporting files, so the \"Uninstaller\" app should know where these locations are for every application.\nWith that being said, there are other paid alternatives, which are more recent.\nYou did a good job, cleaning the ~/Library/ApplicationSupport. \n", "Q: Show an image without any border using Preview or some other built-in macOS app Here is a simple image viewed in Preview.

I rooted around all of the menu items and toolbards for transparency and/or background color but did not find them.\n\n\nA: What you need to do in Preview is to set the fill color of your image to white.  You may have a border but it will be invisible. If your page color is black, then set the background fill as black too.  You might need to set transparency to 100%.  A little trial and error should determine this part.\nIt is possible to set the Border color and Fill Color of your image in Preview. Open your image in Preview and go to the View menu item and under this menu, you'll see an option to Show Markup Toolbar. Make sure this is turned on. This will display the 2nd toolbar with the options to set the fill color and to set the border color. See the image below.\n\nIf you click Show Colors on the menu for setting the fill or border color you will get the Color Wheel to select the color.

For example ~/Library/Reminders/Container_v1/...  I'm curious about these things.  I'm wondering if Apple has a container system with a MacOS inside the container rather than Linux.

I have several issues in my networking ecosystem at home including printing to my Dell 1320c printer\nBasically I used my printer as a network printer, attached to the network via Ethernet cable. So I tried workarounds to circumvent the need for a missing Dell 64-Bit Driver.\nI also read this thread and reinstalled my printer with the Xerox driver. The \"Filter failed\" issue is gone now but another issue popped up. \nThe Print job is starting but showing the message \"printing - connecting to printer\" and after a bit of time \"the printer is unreachable at this time\" or \"printer may not exist or is unavailable at this time\".\nI was also looking for compatible 64-Bit open source drivers but did not find any.\nDoes anybody have another idea what else could fix this issue?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you're out of luck.\nThe problem with these low cost, entry level printers is that they use the host (the computer driving the printer) to supply the engine for it.  \nAccording to the specs (available as a PDF), the Printer Language is \"host based.\"  So, it's significantly more than a driver or a CUPS PPD file - it's actual software driving it.  Because this software is (most likely) 32bit, there's no chance it's going to run on Catalina.\nSo, your options are limited:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a small, cheap computer (like a PC running Windows 7 or 10) or even a Mac mini running Mojave or earlier and share the printer over the network - basically make a home grown print server.\n\n*Downgrade to Mojave\n\n*Buy a new printer (if you go this route, don't get another host based (usually consumer grade) model.

This would be deemed a security risk by Apple.\ncron and launchd\ncrontab exists on macOS. The use of cron is deprecated; Apple recommend launchd where possible.\nWith launchd each user has their own folder, ~/Library/LaunchAgents. Processes started through this mechanism are limited to the scope of the associated user's graphical user session.\nlaunchd also provides locations for computer wide folders, see the manual page Files section on /Library/LaunchAgents and /Library/LaunchDaemons.\nWatched Folders\nmacOS includes support for watched folders. These are likely the closest built-in solution to your description:\n\nThe ability to watch folders and take action on incoming items is a powerful automation technique that enables the creation of fully unattended workflows. A watched folder might be used, for example, to watermark incoming photos, convert them to PDF, and email them to clients for review. Many companies set up script servers—dedicated robot machines that watch folders and process detected items, allowing employees to offload tedious and repetitious work in order to focus on other important tasks.\nIn OS X, there are two primary ways to set up scripting-based watched folders: folder actions and stay open script apps.\n\n\nA: MacOS Mojave and Catalina use launchd for managing daemons and agents.\nThe folders managed by launchd are the following: \n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons   # Apple-supplied system daemons\n/System/Library/LaunchAgents    # Apple-supplied agents that apply to all users on a per-user basis\n/Library/LaunchDaemons          # Third-party system daemons\n/Library/LaunchAgents           # Third-party agents that apply to all users on a per-user basis\n~/Library/LaunchAgents          # Third-party agents that apply only to the logged-in user\n\nThe best to know how to use it is to read the developer documentation here: \nLaunchd -- Apple Support\nI think you answered to your question yourself: ~/Library/LaunchAgents is the folder for third-party users scripts. \n", "Q: Installing from .deb files in macOS Catalina I tried installing dpkg with brew.

Also, it just feels clumsy to use a screenshot because HD the time I end up with UI controls over top the image.\nIs there a way, without third party software, to extract a full resolution still image frame from a video on iOS?\n\nA: I highly recommend a free app called Frame Grabber. It captures still frames from a video, maintaining both original quality up to 4K and metadata (datetime, gps...). It's free and I find it brilliant.\n\nA: No, there is no option in the photos app to extract a single frame.\nDepending on the video resolution you may or may not end up with a lower resolution screenshot. If your video resolution is higher than the screenshots' resolution, you end up with a lower resolution image in the end.

But the sudo process and its forked (now-orphaned) child, the testing script, are still running!\nI suspect this is because the user, not root, is the one closing the Terminal window, and as such does not have the necessary permissions to affect root processes. Is this correct? I feel like I'm missing something basic here. Is there some way to allow the root processes to be terminated by closing the Terminal window?\n\nA: You are talking about orphan processes. As you will see, your question has little to do with sudo. Orphans are assigned to process 1. This process 1 is called init and is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down. Here are two simple examples where orphans are created. The macOS is High Sierra which uses bash as the default shell.\n\nIf you choose to repeat the examples, you will have to replace the process ids with the ones you get. \n\nWhen the parent windows terminates, a hang up signal (SIGHUP) is sent to the child processes. Normally, this causes each child processes to terminate. However, if a child chooses not to terminate or is never sent a hangup signal (SIGHUP), then the child can become an orphan.\nExample 1\nOpen a new Terminal window and enter the command shopt -s huponexit. This command is necessary because bash is a login shell.

Next, the first window is closed. In the popup window, Terminate is selected. A hang up signal (SIGHUP) is sent to process 8972, which is ignored. Process 8972 is now orphaned and will be assigned to process 1. Repeating the ps -axo tty,pid,ppid,args 8993 command in the second window will show this. See below.\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ ps -axo tty,pid,ppid,args 8993\nTTY        PID  PPID ARGS\n??        8993     1 -bash\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$\n\nFinally, the commands shown below are entered to send a terminal signal (SIGTERM) to process 8993 and show that the process has terminated.\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ kill 8993\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ ps -axo tty,pid,ppid,args 8993\nTTY        PID  PPID ARGS\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$\n\nExample 2\nThis is basically the same as example 1, except instead of having the process ignore the hangup signal (SIGHUP), the disown %1 command is used to prevent a hangup signal (SIGHUP) from being sent to the process. Open a new Terminal window and enter the command shopt -s huponexit. This command is necessary because bash is a login shell.

It will not pass on the rest of its arguments, because they're not part of the command string. If you want to include arguments, you'd need to do something like this:\nsh -c \"/usr/sbin/installer -pkg 'path_to_stackexchange.pkg' -target '/'\"\n\nThe double-quotes make that a single long argument to sh, so it'll execute the whole thing and pass -pkg etc as arguments to the installer command.\n(BTW, in the shell, quotes don't nest. Nesting quoted strings inside quoted strings -- like the single-quoted arguments inside that double-quoted argument -- isn't really a thing. In this case it does work, because the inside a double-quoted string, single-quotes are just regular characters. In more complicated situations, things can get weird and confusing.)\nSo what's happening to those other arguments after the command? Well, the command string (the argument after -c) functions a little like a miniature shell script, and those are passed to that mini-script as arguments. But they're not passed to the commands in that mini-script, unless the mini-script explicitly passes them on:\nsh -c '/usr/sbin/installer \"$@\"' installer-thingie -pkg 'path_to_stackexchange.pkg' -target '/'\n\nHere, inside the mini-script, the \"$@\" expands to the arguments to the mini-script (i.e. -pkg, path_to_stackexchange.pkg, etc.), thus passing them on to the installer command.\nBut what's that installer-thingie argument? That's the name the mini-script is run under, so it'll show up as $0 inside the mini-script. Basically, it functions as a placeholder, and you could put pretty much anything there. \"sh\" is a common choice.\nAs for the pros and cons of using sh -c to run commands: unless there's some reason you really need to run another shell, just run the command directly. Running it with sh -c is more complicated and confusing, and (as you've experienced) easy to get wrong.\nAs @DavidAnderson pointed out, using sh -c is also less efficient, because it creates an additional shell process. If you look at the process tree for running installer directly (and assuming your interactive shell is zsh), it looks like this:\nzsh───installer\n\nBut with sh -c, it's like this:\nzsh───sh───installer\n\n...it ran an sh process under your interactive shell, and then that ran installer as a subprocess.\nOn the other hand, if you prefer confusing complexity and inefficiency, there's no reason to stop at one unnecessary shell; why not add another sh -c to run the sh -c command?\nsh -c \"sh -c \\\"/usr/sbin/installer -pkg 'path_to_stackexchange.pkg' -target '/'\\\"\"\n\nor even\nsh -c \"sh -c \\\"sh -c \\\\\\\"/usr/sbin/installer -pkg 'path_to_stackexchange.pkg' -target '/'\\\\\\\"\\\"\"\n\n(did I mention that nesting quotes can get complicated?)\n", "Q: Connecting Logitech Gaming Mouse - Not Connected in G Hub I have a Logitech G600 gaming mouse which I am hoping to use on my MacBook Pro running macOS Mojave.

I'm using macOS Catalina and it's preventing me from sharing my screen in web browsers like Firefox and Chrome, and in other applications too. How do I properly set up permissions so that screen sharing works in all of my apps?\n\nA: I found this suggestion and it worked for me:\nMake sure you launch that app using Finder and not the app PathFinder or any other launcher (Launchbar, Alfred, etc) this has stopped other apps showing in the list.\n\nA: Starting with macOS Catalina, Apple has added a new Screen Recording permission to macOS that needs to be granted to every application that tries to record the screen, either for screen capture (saving a movie locally) or screen sharing (transmitting your screen to somewhere else).\nSecurity & Privacy in System Preferences\nYou can manage permissions for Screen Recording in the System Preferences. However, it doesn't work quite how you would expect! By default the list is empty, as shown below. None of your installed applications are shown in the list, and there is no + button that you could use to add an app. You can't even drag an app into this list.\n\nThe Prompt\nIn order to get an app to show up in this list, you first need to launch the app and activate some functionality inside the app that depends on Screen Recording.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, the fastest way to do this is by visiting screenapp.io (no affiliation, it just works well).\n\n*If you're using Safari, go to Google Hangouts, start a new Video Call, and click the three dots button ⋮ in the top right and then Share Screen.\n\n*If you are using the paid version of Slack:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new private channel with only yourself as a member\n\n*Click the telephone icon \n\n*Press the \"Share your screen\" button in the call window\n\n\n\nThe first time you do this, you'll see a prompt to grant permissions like the one shown below. Make sure you choose \"Open System Preferences\" because you'll only be asked once.\n\nIf you accidentally click Deny, you'll have to reset your privacy settings for Screen Recording.\nGrant the Permission\nAfter clicking \"Open System Preferences\" you'll be taken right to the Screen Recording section of the Privacy settings. Just click the checkbox beside the app you're trying to use.\n\nBut you're not quite done yet! Once you grant the permission, you must quit the application before you can start screen recording. Even though it's quite annoying when you're trying to start a meeting, there's no way around this.\n\nDo it for your other apps now\nBecause macOS Catalina forces you to quit every app you want to use before you can really use it, I suggest granting permission to as many apps as you can think of now before you really need them. This will save quite a headache when you're trying to share your screen for in a meeting. At a bare minimum, make sure to add Safari and your other browsers (eg. Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome).\n", "Q: How do I reset Screen Recording permission on macOS Catalina? I'm using macOS Catalina and I want to use screen sharing in Slack. But when the permission prompt came up I accidentally clicked Deny because it was the default option.\n\nNow I can't get the prompt to come up again. How can I reset permissions so that the prompt comes up again?\n\nA: You need to use tccutil to manage the privacy database -- this involves opening the Terminal and using the command line! If you know the bundle ID of the app you're trying to use, you can use this command:\ntccutil reset ScreenCapture [com.WHATEVERBUNDLE.YOURAPPID]\n\nHere are some examples for common applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.apple.Safari Safari\n\n*tccutil reset ScreenCapture org.mozilla.firefox Mozilla Firefox\n\n*tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.google.Chrome Google Chrome\n\n*tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX QuickTime Player\nIf you're trying to use screencapture on the command line, your terminal application needs to be granted permission.\n\n\n*\n\n*tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.apple.Terminal Terminal\n\n*tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.googlecode.iterm2 iTerm 2\nIf you don't know the app bundle ID, then you can just clear and reset the privacy settings for ScreenCapture for all applications. Note that this will remove all entries from the list of apps allowed to do Screen Recording, and you'll have to re-add them individually.\ntccutil reset ScreenCapture\n\nOnce you've reset the privacy permissions, you must quit your application before the change will take effect. Then you can restart your app and try screen recording again, and the prompt should reappear.\nHelp, it's still not working!\nMake sure that System Integrity Protection is enabled, otherwise these commands won't work correctly. To check, you can run csrutil status and it should say System Integrity Protection status: enabled.\nYou can also try creating a new user account with admin privileges and setting up the Screen Recording permissions in that account. That sometimes helps to put the TCC database back in a good state. This seems to be useful in some cases where the prompt window just isn't shown at all.\n\nA: I think I've had the same problem with Zoom. The way it worked for me was\n\n*\n\n*uninstall the app (ex. Zoom or Skype)\n\n*reboot the computer (very important, uninstall is not enough)\n\n*Reinstall the app and the permission dialog comes up.

It is meant exclusively for transferring files from one device to another. An AirDrop notification would be about someone within your vicinity trying to send you something. You would have been prompted to accept or reject the file.\nOn the other hand, AirDrop doesn't have anything to do with iPhone Mesages, nor does it usually appear in the top right corner as far as I know. Therefore I think it might be that the icon you have seen is actually the new AirPlay icon, which is very similar to the AirDrop icon.

I'm wondering why my MacBook Air (13 inch, early 2015) is so much faster than my iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, Late 2015)?\nThe MacBook Air is configured with a 1.6 Ghz dual-core i5, 4 GB RAM, Intel HD Graphics 6000 and a 128 GB SSD.\nThe iMac is configured with a 3.1 Ghz quad-core i5, 8 GB RAM, Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200 and a 1 TB SATA hard drive.\nI run similar programs on both, some of which you would think would slow down the laptop, yet the laptop always seems to outperform the iMac. The iMac has been incredibly slow lately with Safari being especially painful at times. I thought maybe it was b/c some of my programs probably require a better machine than I have but then those same programs perform great/much faster on the laptop (which I'm sure does not have the min. specs for them). \nThe iMac is incredibly slow especially with opening just about everything from Mail, Photoshop to Safari (yet Firefox opens right up). The heavier program I run on both my machines is called Archicad v. 23. Archicad is much faster to open on the laptop. \nI'm adding a link to some screenshots from the laptop and iMac to compare and screenshots of the current Activity Monitor from the iMac which I just restarted (it would only let me upload two images here so I added the link instead).\nhttps://ibb.co/album/fMBk6F\nUPDATE 3/14: These screenshots here are from the iMac - not sure which are best to post i.e. CPU or Memory, etc. it only allows two images. Also should point out the iMac can run a little better once everything has been loaded and it's been sitting for an hour or two...but the start of programs and getting it running at normal speed after a restart takes a long time.\n\n\nA: Your update definitely suggests it's the hard drive. When you first boot  your computer, it has to read all of the data from the SSD (MacBook) or HDD (iMac). Some of that data is then kept in RAM, so operations depending on that data become faster after they're first run.\nEven with a perfectly healthy HDD and SSD, reading data from an SSD will be faster. It won't be as fast as RAM, but you'll definitely notice the difference vs a conventional HDD.\nHowever, an HDD shouldn't be as slow as you're describing. In general, the first thing you want to blame for slowdowns is the operating system and installed apps. Factory resetting usually helps. But since you say it's only really slow after boot, and gets better from there, I feel pretty confident saying the hard drive is on its way out.\nAnecdotally, I've run into two iMacs that have gotten slower over the years. One was a 2010 iMac and the other is a late-2013 model. (I never actually did any diagnosis on the 2010, but its situation was similar to the 2013's.) Using Disk Utility to repair the filesystem, checking SMART status, and doing some other tests, all told me the drive was healthy. I brought it to a repair shop and had the drive replaced and it's noticeably faster. It's the same data and same software (simple drive clone). The only difference was the drive.\nMy suggestion is to call around to your local repair shops and see what they charge to replace your hard drive. The iMac is incredibly frustrating to take apart, and it's really easy to accidentally sever a wire when removing the screen. If repair shops are too expensive, and you're confident in your repairing skills, iFixit has a whole bunch of guides. Otherwise, your best bet is probably buying an external Thunderbolt 2.0 drive and installing macOS to It.\n\nA: One main difference between the two computers is that your MacBook Air has an SSD - a solid state drive - for data storage, whereas the iMac has an ordinary hard drive. SSDs are typically an order of magnitude faster than hard drives, so if your usage of the computer involves a lot of disk usage, that could explain the perceived speed difference.\nAnother difference is the processor. Here the iMac has the advantage with a CPU that potentially is up to about 3 times faster than the CPU in the MacBook Air. However, if your specific usage of the computer does not involve a lot of heavy CPU usage, or your programs are not written to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, then that advantage could possible be minor.\nEven considering these differences between the two computers, you shouldn't have a \"painfully slow\" experience on the iMac. If it was quick, and now is painfully slow, it doesn't sound like the hardware is just insufficient for the task. It sounds more like a software problem or possible a hardware defect.\nI would suggest testing the software hypothesis by installing macOS on an external USB drive and see if that improves performance - or if you have no problem rolling your computer back to an earlier date, then by restoring an earlier Time Machine backup from before you've experienced the slow downs.\nIn terms of a hardware defect, you could suspect something like a cooling problem. If that were the case, you would probably hear increased fan noise, and/or you would see kernel_task as having a high CPU percentage in Activity Monitor, which the screenshots does not show. Therefore it doesn't seem that a hardware problem is likely just now. You could check your logs (using Console.app) to see if you have any error messages about your disk drive - timeouts here could give massive slow downs throughout the system.\n\nA: \n\"The iMac is incredibly slow especially with opening just about everything […]. Archicad is much faster to open on the laptop.\"\n\"Also should point out the iMac can run a little better once everything has been loaded and it's been sitting for an hour or two...but the start of programs and getting it running at normal speed after a restart takes a long time.\"\n\nThose quotes definitely point to a slow hard disk being the problem.\nWhen you launch a new program, the computer needs to load it (and any data files it needs) from the disk into memory, and the time it takes to do this mostly depends on the read throughput (and, to a lesser degree, on the latency) of the disk.  This is one area in which SSDs shine, often being anywhere from 2 up to 10 times faster than traditional hard disks depending on the workload and the specific drives in question.\nSimilarly, when you restart your computer, the OS itself needs to load itself (and any automatically loaded system software, as well as any programs you've selected to be automatically loaded at startup) from the disk.  MacOS tries to do some of this loading in the background, so that you can start using the system even before everything has been fully loaded, but things will be slow while it's happening — especially if your disk is slow and overloaded with work.\n(As for Firefox starting up fast, I suspect you may have it configured to \"Open at Login\" on your iMac so that its startup time gets swallowed up in the general OS startup time.  You can check this by right-clicking the Firefox icon in the Dock and looking under \"Options\".  Or maybe it's just fast to start up in general.)\nApparently, replacing the HD on your iMac with an SSD is technically possible, but it requires temporarily removing the display, which takes special tools and risks damaging the screen if you're not careful.  If you don't already have experience with this kind of repairs, it might be a better idea to either get a professional to do the replacement for you or, as other answers have suggested, get an external USB 3.0+ and/or Thunderbolt 2 SSD and reinstalling macOS (and at least your most commonly used applications) onto it.\n\nA: I just wanted to give an update and say I finally got around to getting an external SSD drive as was suggested on here. I loaded my operating system onto it and WOW what an improvement from before. I don't know if my computer has ever ran this fast, it changed everything and definitely seems to have worked. I bought the one Apple had on it's site, this one here: https://www.lacie.com/products/mobile-ssd/.  It's only been a few days but I wanted to say THANK YOU for the help and advice on here, very much appreciated!\nPS: For anyone else who attempts this one tip I have is to make \"a bootable USB\" of your operating system first.

Is there a reference somewhere?\nI'm motivated to understand this better because I often find myself setting up new Macs for people, and I find myself wondering which settings are useful to apply in System Preferences while not logged in as the eventual end user.\n\nA: One simple (but not 100% reliable) way to tell is to log in as a \"standard\" user (non-administrator), and see what settings you can change without first clicking a padlock and authenticating as an admin. Very few system-wide settings can be changed by standard users, so if you can change it this way, it's almost certainly per-user.\nYou can run essentially the same test as an admin by going to the Security & Privacy preferences, clicking the padlock & authenticating, clicking the \"Advanced\" button, and selecting \"Require an administrator password to access system-wide preferences\". Then dismiss the Advanced dialog, and click the padlock again to re-lock the system-wide settings.\nThere are a few exceptions and special cases. Switching between network \"locations\", for instance: locations are system-wide, and it takes admin rights to create/modify them, but once they're defined standard users can switch between them.\nJoining a Wi-Fi network is similar. Any user can join a network, check the \"Remember this network\" checkbox, and it'll be added to the system-wide Preferred Networks list (and its password will be copied into the System keychain, so the Mac can connect no matter who's logged in). Well, unless the Wi-Fi network uses \"Enterprise\" (802.1X) authentication; in that case, you're authenticating to the network as a particular user (rather than with a general shared password), so macOS assumes it should be per-user on the Mac as well.\nNote that it's normal for a single preference pane to have a mix of system-wide and per-user settings. Go into the Security & Privacy preference pane, and under the General tab it'll have the controls to change your password and require your password after sleeping / screen saver available, and all the others dimmed. Those are per-user, the dimmed ones are system-wide policies.\nAn even more extreme example of this is iCloud. Most iCloud services are per-user (i.e. each user on the Mac connects to their iCloud account and uses its data/services), but Find My Mac is a computer-wide feature (it's tracking the Mac, not a particular user on it), and can only be turned on for one user's iCloud account at a time.\nOh, and I should mention software installation: any user can install apps via Apple's App Store, but once installed they're available system-wide. For non-App-Store software, it depends on the specific program, but generally it'll either require admin rights to install or be per-user only (e.g. it might create a personal Applications folder under the user's home and install there instead of the regular system-wide Applications folder).\n", "Q: Which version of macOS introduced /System/Applications? Today I discovered quite by accident that several applications are now stored in /System/Applications/. I realized this when I was trying to find the bundle ID of a built-in application, and even though it appeared in the Applications folder it was missing entirely from /Applications! I suspect this change might have come when I recently upgraded to macOS Catalina, but perhaps it was even earlier than that.\nWhich version of macOS introduced the /System/Applications directory? And where is this documented?\n\nA: This is part of a larger macOS Catalina feature wherein system files/apps are located on a read-only filesystem and user data is located on a read/write filesystem. This is to further protect the operating system against malicious or inadvertent damage (i.e. to prevent security problems and OOPS! moments).\nThe read-only and read/write filesystems are stitched together to present as one unified filesystem through some underlying filesystem and logical volume \"magic\".\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210650\n\n*https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/macos-10-15-catalina-the-ars-technica-review/11/#h1\n", "Q: debug kernel_task large memory usage htop shows kernel_task used 25% of the memory on 8GB memory Macbook Air.\nBut the sum of the size column of kextstat is only 31830608.

It would not make sense to compare them or expect that they should be equal.\nThe Size column in your kextstat output shows much memory the kernel extension itself takes up in memory. This is the amount of the memory that the code/data in the kernel extension itself takes up (i.e. comparable to the binary file size of the kernel extension). It doesn't have anything to do with how much memory the kernel extension has used. Kernel extensions can dynamically allocate memory while running, and it doesn't show up in the Size column here, as it is a different thing.\nThe kernel_task memory usage shown is htop shows the actual memory usage of the kernel - this includes dynamically allocated memory. It can include memory used for the kernel itself, kernel extensions or memory allocated by the kernel on behalf of applications. \nUPDATE: You have updated your question to ask a completely different question - namely \"How to debug what threads take the most of the memory?\". \nThis seems to indicate to me that this is a X/Y-question - you probably have some root issue you want to solve, and somehow you've come down a path where it makes sense for you to ask this question. However, the question doesn't really make much sense in technical terms, so it is difficult to actually help you without details on the actual problem you're trying to solve.\nTechnically, you cannot in general separate memory usage for each thread in a task like you want to do here. The very definition of threads (in this case, and almost always in other cases) is that they share memory with other threads. Therefore several threads inside a task could be using the same memory - and one thread can allocate memory that is used by a second thread that is eventually deallocated by a third thread. There exists a special class of memory named \"thread local storage\" which is really separate for each thread, but this construct is not commonly used in the macOS kernel (or in kernels in general). \nObviously you could instrument the kernel to log each allocation of memory and noting which thread did the allocation - but it wouldn't allow you to directly conclude that any \"bug\" is actually in that thread or anything like that.\nBy reading your question and various comments, you original problem sounds like you think your system is using too much memory, and you think a kernel extension is the culprit, but you do not know which one. These assumptions might be wrong (also on your part, as it is very common for non-technical people to have wrong assumptions on how memory allocation in computers actually work today).\nIn any case, I think the tool you might be looking for is simply zprint. Start Terminal.app and run:\nsudo zprint -s -t \n\nThis will print the total size of allocations created in each zone sorted by the sum.\nThis won't tell you which thread uses the most memory (obviously), but it is probably the values you're actually looking for.\n", "Q: How do I configure Camera and Microphone permission on macOS Mojave? I'm using macOS Mojave and it's preventing me from using my camera and microphone in web browsers like Firefox and Chrome, and in other applications too. How do I properly set up permissions so that my camera and microphone work in all of my apps?\n\nA: I was months looking for a solution and none of them worked for me. Apps simply didn't ask for permission. Then I remembered that I had disabled SIP(System Integrity Protection). Re-enabling does the job!\n\nCheck if SIP is disabled:\n$ csrutil status\n\nIf you get System Integrity Protection status: disabled. We have to re-enable it. \nRestart your Mac in recovery mode:\n\nBefore OS X starts up, hold down Command-R and keep it held down until you see an Apple icon and a progress bar. Release. This boots you into Recovery.\n\nIn recovery mode, Utilities menu, select Terminal and execute:\n$ csrutil enable\n$ csrutil clear\n\nReboot and the apps should ask again for every permission.\n\nA: Starting with macOS Mojave, Apple has added new permissions to macOS that need to be granted before an application can use the Camera or Microphone. This affects all kind of calling software, and also affects web browsers that you might use for joining online meetings.\nSecurity & Privacy in System Preferences\nYou can manage permissions for Camera and Microphone in the System Preferences. However, it doesn't work quite how you would expect! By default the list is empty, as shown below. None of your installed applications are shown in the list, and there is no + button that you could use to add an app. You can't even drag an app into this list.\n\nThe Prompt\nIn order to get an app to show up in this list, you first need to launch the app and activate some functionality inside the app that uses the Camera and Microphone.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using QuickTime Player, open the File menu and choose New Movie Recording.\n\n*If you're using Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, the fastest way to do this is by visiting screenapp.io (no affiliation, it just works well).\n\n*If you're using Safari, go to Google Hangouts and start a new Video Call.\n\n*If you are using Slack (paid version only):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new private channel with only yourself as a member\n\n*Click the telephone icon \n\n*Press the \"Share your screen\" button in the call window\n\n\n\nYou'll see a prompt like \"QuickTime Player\" would like to access the microphone. Make sure to click OK because you'll only be asked once.\n\nIf you aren't presented with this prompt, first ensure that System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled on your Mac. To check, you can run csrutil status and it should say System Integrity Protection status: enabled. If SIP is enabled and the prompt still doesn't appear, you'll have to reset your privacy settings for Camera or Microphone using tccutil.\nOnce you've passed these prompts for camera and microphone, you should be able to use both devices in the current application. The setting is permanent, but only for one application at a time. If you want to use your camera or microphone in a different application, you'll need to authorize it again using the same procedure.\n\nA: To add to crgarridos' answer (not allowed to comment due to being new here), there's some nuance to the buggy behavior:\nIf you set up your machine and immediately disable SIP, before any device has requested access to the microphone or camera, then the requests do not work at all. The app says it's requesting access, and the System Preferences / Security / Privacy pane never shows a request.\nSo in this case you need to boot into recovery mode, and from the terminal there enable SIP with \"csrutil enable\", reboot normally, make a single application request (so far I believe if a single request to a single device is enough, but you might want to cover both the microphone & camera to be on the safe side), and then reboot back into recovery mode, disabling SIP again, and rebooting normally a second time. Once this is done, future requests will be handled correctly.\n\nA: An alternative solution to crgarridos and Nics that worked for me is to reset NVRAM/PRAM.\nMy System Integrity Protection (SIP) is (and was) disabled and should stay that way (running on Catalina-Patch).\nI found the solution in this article.\n\nA: You can use tccctl utility and manually grant permission as long as you have the service name (i.e. microphone access \"kTCCServiceMicrophone\") and package/bundle ID (i.e. FinalCutProX app \"com.apple.FinalCutProX\") or program path (i.e. /Applications/Final\\ Cut\\ Pro.app)\ntccctl --grant -b com.apple.FinalCutProX -s kTCCServiceMicrophone\n\nor\ntccctl --grant -P /Applications/Final\\ Cut\\ Pro.app -s kTCCServiceMicrophone\n\nThese permissions should now show in System Pref -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Microphone\n", "Q: How do I reset Camera and Microphone permission on macOS Mojave? I'm using macOS Mojave and I want to use my camera and microphone to make a New Movie Recording in QuickTime Player. But when I try it gives me this error.\n\nQuickTime Player is not authorized to access the microphone.\n\nI looked in System Preferences but the list is empty, and there's no + plus button for me to add an app, and I can't drag apps into the list. I think maybe this came up once before and I clicked Don't Allow. Now I can't get this prompt to come up again. How can I reset permissions so that the prompt comes back?\n\n\nA: You need to use tccutil to manage the privacy database -- this involves opening the Terminal and using the command line! Here's how to do it for QuickTime Player:\ntccutil reset Camera com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX\ntccutil reset Microphone com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX\n\nOther Applications\nYou might need to reset Camera or Microphone permissions for other apps too. If you know the bundle ID of the app you're trying to use, you can use this command:\ntccutil reset Camera [com.WHATEVERBUNDLE.YOURAPPID]\ntccutil reset Microphone [com.WHATEVERBUNDLE.YOURAPPID]\n\nExamples for Common Applications\nSafari\ntccutil reset Camera com.apple.Safari\ntccutil reset Microphone com.apple.Safari\n\nMozilla Firefox\ntccutil reset Camera org.mozilla.firefox\ntccutil reset Microphone org.mozilla.firefox\n\nGoogle Chrome\ntccutil reset Camera com.google.Chrome\ntccutil reset Microphone com.google.Chrome\n\nSlack\ntccutil reset Camera com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap\ntccutil reset Microphone com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap\n\nThe Nuclear Option\nIf you're running macOS Mojave (10.14) or if you just don't know the app bundle ID, then you'll need to reset Camera and Microphone permissions for all applications. This will remove any other apps that have been granted permission in the past, so you'll get prompted again by other apps.\ntccutil reset Camera\ntccutil reset Microphone\n\nOnce you've reset the camera and microphone permissions, you must quit your application before the change will take effect. Then you can restart your app and try using camera or microphone again, and the prompt should reappear.\n\nHelp, it's still not working!\nMake sure that System Integrity Protection is enabled, otherwise these commands won't work correctly. To check, you can run csrutil status and it should say System Integrity Protection status: enabled.\n", "Q: Can you determine exactly when iMac was disconnected from power? (This is not just question about when a normal power failure occurred)\nMy 2017 iMac was stolen today during a break-in, but the internal hard drive was dead so it was running off of an external SSD. They unplugged everything including the external drive and left it behind. I'm trying to figure out if there is a system log that keeps an ongoing record with enough time resolution to figure out close to exactly when the power was unplugged.\nI can't boot it up, but I can look through the file system on another Mac. I was able to find a couple of plist files updated most recently, but it only gives me a several-hour window and I'd like to get more accurate if possible. I'm was running Catalina and I'm not able to find anything more recent in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/\nAre there any very low-level system processes that might have a record? Something like cron (though I wasn't running any scheduled jobs)?\n\nA: You would need to look through the system log for the last \"Shutdown Cause\" code.  \nThere won't be anything in cron because it was deprecated in favor of launchd.  However, launchd (or cron) wouldn't be of help because those logs show when things are started or error out, seldom do they show when things are shutdown - especially if powered off properly (no error)\nTo search the log, use the following command:\n$ log show --predicate \"process == kernel\" | grep -i \"shutdown cause\"\n\nSee this answer for further details on how to search the log.  \n\nA: You want to find all files that are newer (based on time of last modification) than the .plist files you've already found. So if this is the name of the .plist file you already know about...\n/Users/yourusername/Library/Preferences/whatever.plist\nThen you want to use find like this:\nfind / -newermm /Users/yourusername/Library/Preferences/whatever.plist\n\nYou might see some lines like Permission denied -- just ignore those, it's fine.\nThis will search the whole disk for files accessed more recently than your comparison file. It might take a while. If you get many results, pick one of the results and try the find command again, substituting your newer file into the command. Rinse and repeat until you've found the newest file.\n", "Q: Create MacOS style screenshots with drop shadow using Imagemagick How do I add the drop shadow to any image with imagemagick to create the same effect that the screenshot on MacOS adds to screenshots when screencapture shadow is true?\nBefore and after pictures are to clarify the effect I am seeking. \n\n\n\nA: The following appears to work.

Instead, the switching order seems rather random (I have 7 keyboards enabled). I can't get to understand the behavior or to find a pattern.\nHas anybody the same issue? I am asking because daily I use only 2 or 3 of them, and it is \"annoying\" to open the full list by holding the button when typing.\n\nA: It’s not actually random unless you’re experiencing a bug I haven’t seen. If you switch keyboards in fast succession, it cycles through the list in the same order as it’s presented when you hold. However, if you wait a second after switching the keyboard, the next time you press the globe button it goes BACK to the last keyboard you used (i.e. the last keyboard you kept open for a second or more). So if you don’t switch fast, you’ll end up switching between just two keyboards. I assume this is designed for bilingual people like me, but I agree that it’s confusing sometimes. One confusing consequence of this is that if I have keyboards A, B and C installed (ordered the same way in the list), I’m currently on B and before that I used A, then here’s what happens if I start quickly switching keyboards: it first goes to A because that’s what I last used, but then it SKIPS B and jumps to C, and from there starts cycling through the list. The full trajectory in this example ends up being B A C A B C A B C...\nI would like an option to make the globe button cycle through only a subset of keyboards and make all other keyboards accessible only by holding.\n", "Q: Why does the Kind column show the Chinese characters 文件 for Markdown files?

That should be shown in the cropped portion of the get info you showed in your question.\nAlso, there are layers of programs that can \"ask\" to open a file type, and layers of file type on each file (shown as kMDItemContentTypeTree) - so depending on the order in which you install apps, the same Mac with the same apps installed might get different results based on the order in which the apps installed, and how you use the apps and if you change and of the spotlight / CoreServices defaults.\nTo pick this apart, I use a tool lsregister to dump the entire launch services database and parse out items. It's a bit painstaking, but you can always do this if you can't find the app you installed, right click on the icon in question and use Open With... to change the default app to one you prefer how it shows in Finder. Also - now that you know which app Finder is trusting to \"name\" that new file type/kind - you can open a support request with that software maker to change what's displayed - they likely made a bug in the localization and listed Chinese text for the UK English localized text.\n", "Q: Java DICOM viewer fails on MacOS Catalania (10.15.3) I have a CD containing the images of the MRT I had recently. I tried to start the DICOM viewer which is on the CD as well. However the viewer fails with the error: \nWARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred\nWARNING: Illegal reflective access by org.eclipse.osgi.internal.baseadaptor.BaseStorage (file:/Users/manuel/2016-11-18 - CT Josephskrankenhaus/PLUGINS/OSGI.JAR) to method java.net.URLClassLoader.addURL(java.net.URL)\nWARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of org.eclipse.osgi.internal.baseadaptor.BaseStorage\nWARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations\nWARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release\n\nReturn value is 13. How can I troubleshoot this problem?\n\nA: These warnings are caused by Oracle tightening security in the JVM (which is unfortunately badly needed) but currently does not cause the process to crash.   \nHence my guess is that something else has broken.  Without anything further to go on, I would guess (based on the exit code 13) that the Java DICOM viewer is 1) rather old and 2) links in native code, notably Java 6 (perhaps even 5) and native 32-bit library.\nUnfortunately for you, modern Java versions are 64-bit only, and cannot use 32-bit libraries, so if I'm right the Java you have now will not run this program.  You might, however, have luck in getting the old Java 6 from Apple and use that instead, but only if you have not upgraded to Catalina.\nI would look around for a newer version of the DICOM viewer on the net.  You might be lucky.\n", "Q: Cannot dismiss Trust this Computer even with the cable disconnected I plugged my iPhone to my Mac using an USB cable and noticed the Trust this Computer dialog was randomly flashing. I couldn't tap any of the two buttons (Trust / Don't Trust) and I assumed it was because the modal was not staying on for long enough.\nI tried a few more cables, I assumed they were just bad. The one I used first I only ever use for charging, so I figured its data lines were broken. The other cables didn't help, the modal was still flashing which each one. It's possible they were all bad, it was a mix of the official and 3rd party ones (I tried like five) and both kinds are known to suck.\nHowever, trying the last cable, I noticed the modal stopped flashing and stayed on. The buttons still didn't react to tap, so I disconnected the cable figuring that it will disappear and I'll reconnect and try again with yet another cable.\nHowever, the modal didn't dismiss itself after the cable got disconnected. Instead, it stayed on, unresponsive. I can't use the area outside of the modal to do anything, I can't even slide up to unlock (this is an iPhone X) and FaceID failed too many times and now I need to enter my unlock code, which I can't do, because the modal is over the numpad.\nI wanted to restart the phone, but iPhone X reset is volume up, volume down, power and then slide on the screen. I can't use the shutdown slider because the fricking modal is over it, too!\nIs my only hope now to let the phone discharge enough so that it dies and recharging it to restart it to make the modal go away?

This test however, isn't the end-all.  It's good for a quick diagnostic, but may give you a false positive.  Even if you get \"Verified\" you'll still want to run a disk utility like Disk Drill or Disk Warrior to do a deeper scan. \nNow, given that this is a 2011 MacBook Pro, it's a coin-toss as to whether you should spend money fixing it.  A new Samsung EVO SSD can be had for about $60 USD, but no matter how inexpensive the drive, you're still left with a 9+ year old Mac.  \nPersonally, I'd look at either finding a super cheap SSD and resurrect it for knocking about, or I would part it out (worth more on eBay as parts than as a whole) and put the funds toward a new machine.\n", "Q: How to restore my keyboard to default settings?

I have a simple table (date, value) and I want to display that data in a chart.\nThis is my current chart:\n\nAs you can see, I don't have a value for each day, there is about one month between the last two dates. This makes my chart looks wrong, because it creates the same spaces between two dates, irrespectively of the date value.\nIf I create a new table with one row per day, I get the expected chart. But I need to create all that useless empty rows:\n\nIs there a way to create a chart with a date-based x-axis? Can I create a chart that looks like the second one, but with the data from the first table?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can make a plot using your x,y values and then change the x-axis to be what you want. maybe your x values only run from 0 to 5 but y-data has x-values from 0-50. Click on your plot and then click on the axis tab in the right sidebar. From here you can select the x-axis and on the panel that appears you can input the min and max x-values you wish to use. See figure below.\n\n\nA: I think I have found a partial solution (partial because it is not available on most of the other chart types) to your problem: Scatter chart! \nIt is possible to set the data type for the x-axis in a scatter chart in Numbers. I think this solution would work the best in your case if you have only one data point per date. Also note that the scatter chart displays the data points as sorted on the x-axis values.\nBelow picture shows how the same data look when plotted with \"2D Area\" and \"2D Scatter\" charts which are the upper and lower charts, respectively. The settings on the right in the picture belong to the 2D Scatter chart. \nAs a side note, I am not exactly sure why and this seems to be a bit random but, in my experience, it is usually easier (or sometimes only possible) to point to the data references correctly for a chart in Numbers when the table to be input to the chart has only a header row but no header columns. After selecting the table, you can set the header rows and columns for the table to be input to your chart from the Table menu at the top of Numbers.\n\n", "Q: Disable automatic switching to 4G from WiFi which doesn't have internet connection Have iPhone which is connected to WiFi network which doesn't have access to internet. iOS apparently detects that there is no internet and tries to disable WiFi for a short period of time and connect to 4G.\nNoticed it because iPhone is connected to AirPlay device and music is stopped every ~15 minutes and when I check the connection I see 4G, but not WiFi.\n\nA: Put your iPhone into Airplane Mode to disable the cellular connection.

The startup disk is a 256 GB SSD and then I have another 1TB HDD installed as well. I use it for both design (Adobe Suite, Sketch, etc) and front-end dev (node, mongo, etc) as well as a little Wordpress dev. For a 2011, I can't really complain about its performance - it starts up in under 30 seconds, can handle NUMEROUS browser, terminal and VScode tabs and run Illustrator and Photoshop pretty flawlessly. If I have a server or 2 running in the background, some of that starts to suffer.\nBased on all that, I'm inclined to think \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\", BUT I just read about the thing people with 1 SSD and 1 HDD have been doing for quite a while now, which is combining the 2 for a Fusion Disk and have to say I'm a little more than intrigued.\nDoing this would require me to reorganize all my applications, project folders, scripts, etc so it wouldn't be a small undertaking, but if it will give the boost in performance many have reported, it will probably be worth it.\nGiven my system specs and the type of work I'm doing on it, am I likely to see a noticeable change?\n\nA: I would say: No. \nMy experience of using a Fusion Drive in a 2012 Mini for several years is that the shared performance benefit lessens as the drive fills up. \nSecondly, and perhaps most importantly: a Fusion Drive has two points of failure, and a nine-year-old hard drive is increasingly likely to fail, at which point you will have only your backup. ;-)\nYour best course of action is to use the 256Gb SSD as your System disk and farm out user data 'overspill' to a faster external drive.\n", "Q: SSTP Client with Search Domains I am connecting to my work's vpn via sstp-client on my mac.\nEverything is working except that I cannot use short names in urls.\nFor example, if I type \"servera\" it doesn't resolve to anything.

I have a table with a basic formula:\n\nThe 7th column (1038€94) is calculated with the formula 1133€34 - 94€40 + (empty cell). In others words, the 7th column is calulated by (value in the row above) - (value of the 4th cell of the row) + (value of the 5th cell of the row).\nAll the rows have the same formula in the 7th column.\nThe first column is a date. If I choose to sort the rows depending on this date, the formula breaks because Numbers keeps a pointer to the cells before sorting the data:\n\nIs there a way to sort the rows without breaking the formula? Or make the formula uses the cell above without specifying the line in the formula?\nThanks\n\nA: I think there is no easy solution to this within Numbers. You should either copy your table to another sheet as values (formula results) whenever you need to sort it or recreate your formulas using, for example, the vlookup() function (also check the hlookup() and other reference functions in Numbers in case necessary) if you need to sort in-place. In the 2nd solution, instead of getting 1133,34 by a direct reference to its cell, you would get it (and any other numbers not at the same row in the formula yielding 1038,94) through a separate \"vlookup\" each. In addition, all \"vlookup\"s should be created sort-proof specifically against column-based sorts. \nBy column-based sort-proofing, I mean the cell references within \"vlookup\"s should directly refer only to the cells in the same row or the whole table. Then, assuming the formulas in the column where 1133,34 is calculated are parallel, you can use the same formula for all the cells in the same column by copy & pasting it.\nBelow is an example formula if you wish to take the 2nd option. It simply adds two values from the \"some variable\" column. The first value is from the current row and the second from two days earlier. Pls note the exact use of absolute cell references in the formula (the $ signs, necessary so that the same formula can be used in other cells in the same column by copy & paste) and how the date for two days earlier is referenced to in the vlookup in the formula.\n\nHere is a copy of the same formula in text in case you have trouble recreating it and wish to copy & paste from here:\n= B5+VLOOKUP($A5−2,$A$2:$C$5,2,0)\n\nAnd here is how the table and the same formula looks like when the table is sorted based on the date:\n\n\nA: For cells you wish to reference in a formula using their relative position to the current cell, you'll need to construct references based on the row and column number of the current cell. You can then use the INDIRECT() function to get the value of the cell at that reference.\nFor example, suppose the formula for cell G24 is\n= G23 - D24 + E24,\nand after sorting rows, this becomes e.g. cell G5, whose formula you then want to be\n= G4 - D5 + E5,\nregardless of where the original row 23 ends up after sorting. Then you can use the following formula for cell G24:\n= INDIRECT( \"G\" & (ROW()-1) ) - D24 + E24.\nThus, after sorting rows, when G24 becomes e.g. G5, the formula becomes\n= INDIRECT( \"G\" & (ROW()-1) ) - D5 + E5,\nwhich gives you the desired result.\n\nFor maintaining relative references involving columns potentially changing order, you can use the RxCy cell reference notation, where x is the row index and y is the column index. To use this, you must specify FALSE (or equivalent, e.g. 0) as the second argument to INDIRECT().\nFor example, if cell E7 has formula\n= E6 + D7\nThen you can make all (row and column) references relative using the following formula instead:\n= INDIRECT( \"R\"&(ROW()-1) & \"C\"&COL(), FALSE ) + INDIRECT( \"R\"&ROW() & \"C\"&(COL()-1), FALSE ).\n\nA: If you are not using the dollar sign in your formulas sorting should maintain your correct algebra. If you click on a formula cell, you see a small colored box with a pulldown symbol on it. See the image below.  I'm referring to the blue box.\n\nIf you click on the downward pointing triangle you get the followin pane:\n\nMake sure neither check boxes are checked.\n", "Q: Bottom of iPhone screen unresponsive The screen of my iPhone 6 suddenly stopped responding to any touches registered below the middle of the screen. I can still use the home button and the other buttons, but the lower half of the screen is totally unresponsive. I had just gotten the phone slightly wet and am concerned that I may have damaged the hardware somehow.\n\nA: There are several causes for behavior like this, but in this case, the fix was really simple. My phone has a two-piece Anker protective case in which the front part covers the entirety of the screen, much like a screen protector. Some of the water got between the front of my phone case and the screen and was screwing up the touch screen responsiveness. All I needed to do was remove the phone case, wipe the water off of the front of the screen with my sleeve, and voila! Good as new.

No go. \nMac OS 10.15.3\n\nA: I just don't think Gatekeeper (spctl) will do you want it to do.\nGatekeeper only checks access restrictions the first time an app is run. So if you're trying to block an app that you've run at least one time before, it probably just isn't going to work at all. If you've ever tried to download and run an unsigned third party app from the internet, you've seen that you only get prompted the first time you try to run it.\nFurthermore, the software that is bundled with macOS (like News.app) very likely has the signatures pre-loaded into the Gatekeeper database in a way that cannot be overridden. In other words, the whitelist seems to have precedence over the blacklist. Strangely, this built-in whitelist doesn't seem to be shown from spctl  --list. The best evidence I have for this theory is that the CDHash of News.app doesn't seem to appear anywhere in the Gatekeeper SQLite database (/var/db/SystemPolicy). Instead, it seems to be permitted to run because the certificate is signed by one of the trusted authority root certificates.\nYou could probably disable Apple's built-in authority certificates, but that would probably stop all kinds of software from running on your machine and end up being a real, real bad scene that ends with recovery.\nThere are probably ways to block News.app from running, but I don't think Gatekeeper will do it.\n\nA: Ended up setting chflags hidden for the apps I wanted to block. \nDetails are here (thanks to bogdanw):\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spctl-command-gatekeeper-disabled-list-with-news-app-app-still-runs.2226594/\nLong and short:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, with admin account create aliases to apps that will be hidden.\n\n*In recovery mode, set chflags hidden for app that are to be hidden.\n\n", "Q: Installing cocoapods on macOS Mojave I have looked through  a lot of these questions and none seem to apply.

So I tried to copy /usr/share/locale/no_NO to /usr/share/locale/en_NO and change it to suite my needs and of course I receive mkdir: en_NO: Operation not permitted because the system volume is mounted as read only on Catalina. So, is there any way I can add my own locale?\n\nA: I don't know if your issue was identical to mine, but this worked for me at least. \nI also noticed that my system tried to set nb_no.UTF-8 (and failed) instead of no.NO.\n\n\n*\n\n*vim ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n\n*set -x LC_ALL no_NO.UTF-8\n\nA: Procedure from my cookbook to add a new locale\nThis works on MacOS 12.5 Monterrey over Macs with SIP (System Integrity Protection), M1 chip:\nFirst of all check if regionality exists in the system:\nlocale -a | grep en_NO\n\nIf there are no results, regionality does not exist. It's no use making a copy because the root is mounted read-only and SIP doesn't allow you to modify it. Although there is the possibility of writing to it, it will not be possible to use SIP again so that the changes persist. localedef doesn't work either. The solution is to create a home folder and change the path where glibc looks for the locales:\nmkdir ~/.locale\ncp -rpf /usr/share/locale/en_GB.UTF-8 ~/.locale/en_NO.UTF-8\nexport PATH_LOCALE=~/.locale\nexport LC_ALL=en_NO.UTF-8\n\nNow the system will have the corresponding regionality. The following lines could be added to the ˜/.profile file so that changes in the terminal take permanent effect:\nexport PATH_LOCALE=~/.locale\nexport LC_ALL=en_NO.UTF-8\n\nIf on the other hand locale exists on the system (if locale -a | grep en_does NOT return a result) it only achieves the following:\nexport LC_ALL=en_NO.UTF-8\n\nIn the same way this line can be in ˜/.profile. In my case I use es_AR based on locale provided by the system es_ES.

You can check this by the running the command fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify.  \nIf it shows NTFS DisableDeleteNotify = 0 then trim is enabled. See How to Check if TRIM Is Enabled for Your SSD (and Enable It if It Isn’t) \nThe actual trim is run automatically on a schedule (weekly by default) or you can search for Defragment and Optimize Drives from the Start Menu and click on the \"Optimize\" button to run it immediately.  \nThis is from my Boot Camp partition:\n\n\nA: These days I wouldn't worry at all about SSD wear-levelling, especially on a large SSD.\nFor one, just because the drive appears to the user to be partitioned in 'halves' doesn't mean the SSD itself will treat it that way at all - it's all just data, which it will write wherever it feels like, according to some pretty complex levelling routines. It will not respect the partitions as 'hard borders' in the slightest.\nSecondly, modern SSDs are considerably more likely to be discarded with the computer they're in when both eventually become obsolete - far earlier than they are likely to reach the end of their useful life.\nAnecdotally, my current 1TB SSD is now 6 years old & still going strong.

In contrast, some people buy larger monitors so that everything appears larger, perhaps to compensate for poor eyesight.\nLuckily macOS can accomodate for both preferences. In the System Preferences, under Displays, you can enable Scaled mode and choose More Space so that everything appears smaller, and you can see more things on screen at once.\n\n", "Q: Will ethernet work off of Thunderbolt/mDisplayPort/Ethernet adapter? I'm trying to restore from Time capsule (via fresh recovery). Attempting to use Ethernet so the restore is faster. \nSo I'm using an old mini displayport Ethernet adapter I have. But my MacBook needs thunderbolt. So I have a thunderbolt to mini display port adapter.\nIs this form of daisy chain going to work? I ask because it's not getting an IP and the router doesn't light up either (tested both cables by directly connecting router to TC and it lights up so I know the cables and dhcp ability is working) A\n\n\nA: You seem to have your terminology mixed up, which makes it difficult to answer your question.\nMini-DisplayPort is a standard for transferring display signals only. There exists no such thing as a Mini-DisplayPort to Ethernet adapter. In fact what you have is probably a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter. Thunderbolt uses the same physical plug as Mini-DisplayPort, but it is completely different thing.\nWhen you say your laptop requires Thunderbolt, I think you're mistaken again. The picture you have included shows what appears to be a Thunderbolt 3 plug. Therefore I think your laptop really has Thunderbolt 3 ports, and not just Thunderbolt.\nAgain when looking at the photo, it seems to me that you are mistaken in saying that you have a \"Mini-DisplayPort to Ethernet\" adapter at all - i.e. it's not even Thunderbolt. The way you have taken the picture makes it impossible for us to see which plug goes with which adapter unfortunately. I do think I recognize the product as being a USB-C to Mini-DisplayPort adapter. If that is the case, you cannot use this adapter at all for this purpose.\nYou can buy a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter for connecting the ethernet adapter to your laptop:\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter\nHowever it's probably cheaper to just buy a USB-C to Ethernet adapter in the first place. It could be something like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Ethernet-Thunderbolt-Gigabit-Network-Compatible/dp/B07XTGKP5M/\n\nA: A thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter will present all devices to your Mac using USB-C connector and Thiunderbolt 3. That works with thunderbolt displays, thunderbolt Ethernet and USB on Thunderbolt docks / bridges.\n", "Q: Connecting 13 inch 2018 MacBookPro to Dell U2417h I currently have a 13 inch 2018 macbook pro (no touchbar) which is connected to a LG monitor using a HDMI to USBC charger.  This leaves one extra port for charging. \nI want to connect another monitor (Dell U2417h) to my laptop.

Can I use the same cable I use to connect to my LG monitor? I also want to charge my computer at the same time.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you want to be able to charge your laptop at the same time, you'll can use a Thunderbolt 3 dock or hub to connect the two monitors at the same time as well as charging through a single port on your laptop - leaving one port available for charging.\nA product that will allow you to do this could be the OWC Thunderbolt 3 dock:\nhttps://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt-3-dock-14-port\nYou would then connect your existing monitor using your existing cable to the dock. use a mini-Displayport to DisplayPort cable to connect your U2417H monitor to the dock. The dock comes with a Thunderbolt 3 cable that connects the laptop to the dock. The dock provides charging to the laptop.\nThere exist similar products at various price points from several other brands.\nIf you want to use your existing dongle you can simply connect your charger to the dongle, connect the dongle to the laptop and use an HDMI-to-HDMI cable to connect the U2417H monitor. The existing monitor uses the same cable as before.\nThis is obviously much cheaper for you, but you'll need to plug two cables into the laptop leaving no ports free for other uses.\n", "Q: What is the function of Plus button (﹢) in Apple Podcasts app for iOS?

In the \"Size\" column some values were preceded by an upward-pointing or downward-pointing arrow.  One of the folder items had an arrow and a particularly odd \"Size\" value consisting of the text \"760... 1 byte\".  The ellipsis did not expand into more text when I expanded the Size column to its maximum width, as indicated here:\n\nI have not been able to locate a description of what the arrows displayed in the \"Size\" column are intended to signify.  I'm guessing they could be iCloud-related data transfers. Does anyone know what they indicate?\nAnd does anyone know what that Size information for the \"ESP32\" folder is indicating?\nIncidentally, taking the above image with the Grab utility - which is set to use iCloud storage - immediately \"fixed\" my iCloud sync issue which is what I had originally intended to write a question about.  I almost feel like adding a Community question to suggest that as a possible solution to fixing a \"stuck\" iCloud sync issue.\n\nA: The up arrow means the file is uploading. The reason for the unusual size is because that's the size that has been uploaded. Not the size of the total file. Once the file finishes uploading to your computer it will have a \"normal\" looking size and the arrow will disappear.\nDownloading 4 files/folders at once will slow them all down.

I'm trying to find a legacy Mac that I can use to boot into Mac OS 9. I've found an old iMac G4 in the classified ads, but it has Mac OS X currently installed and I'm not sure if it's compatible with Mac OS 9. This is what I could learn about it by looking at Hardware Overview in System Profiler:\nMachine Name:       iMac\nMachine Model:      PowerMac4,2\nCPU Type:           PowerPC G4 (2.1)\nNumber of CPUs:     1\nCPU Speed:          800 MHz\nL2 Cache (per CPU): 256 KB\nMemory:             1 GB\nBus Speed:          100 MHz\nBoot ROM Version:   4.4.0f1\nSerial Number:      <redacted>\n\nBased on this information, it seems to match two different models on EveryMac: M8535LL/A and M9105LL/A. But only one of those models has support for booting into Mac OS 9. Is there any way for me to identify which exact model is this computer? Do they have different Boot ROM? I want to know for sure before I buy it, and I can't try installing Mac OS 9 on somebody else's computer.\n\nA: This is going off of memory so unfortunately, I don't have a reference.\nBut the partial serial number that you provided QT219 gives us a clue as to when it was manufactured:\n\n\n*\n\n*QT - I believe this is the device (i.e. iMac), but it's not really relevant\n\n*2  - The year it was manufactured.  0 = 2000, 1 = 2001, 2 = 2002, etc.\n\n*19 - Week in which it was manufactured.  19 = 19th week.\n\n\nSo, just looking up the week numbers for 2002, we can deduce that the iMac was manufactured sometime between May 6th and May 12th, 2002.  That model, M8535LL/A, was made between Jan. 2002 and Feb. 2003, is the model that can run Mac OS 9 \n", "Q: Copy spotlight comments into a text file? Background: My parents over the years have been scanning in old photos as jpeg files. As they have been doing that they have been making notes on who/what is in the photo in the comments section of the file properties -- The spotlight comments field. (Select a file and do a get info or pres Command-I). Unbeknownst to them, this info doesn't transfer when you move the file to a thumb-stick and put it on a Windows machine OR if you back it up to something like Google Drive/Drop box etc. Over the years they have amassed possibly hundreds (possibly thousands) of photos with comments... I really wish I would have know they are doing this and stopped them. Anyway my thought is a better way of doing this would be to have a txt file with the same name as the jpeg file and put the comments in there...\nSo, question, does anyone know if there is a program that will help me bulk export the comments to a txt file? What about Automator? Can that automate the process of taking a bunch of jpeg files, reading the comments section of the file properties on said files, then creating individual txt files with the same name as the photo and pasting those comments into the txt file?

I'd like to have my MacBook Pro to automatically log out when it hasn't been used for a certain period of time, e.g., 30 minutes. I defined my System Preferences to do so when it's \"inactive\" for that period of time. However, it doesn't seem to automatically log out if I close the lid when I'm done working. For example, if I close my lid and my Mac sleeps overnight, opening the lid in the morning shows me the account that was last logged in. \n\nDoes sleeping prevent a Mac from logging out automatically? From my point of view, sleeping is the ultimate form of inactivity.\nIf the above is true, is there a way to make my Mac to automatically log out despite its sleep state? Or could I even force it to log out immediately when it goes to sleep?\nI see many questions on this site and other sites that talk about ways to prevent automatic sleep or log-out behavior, but not anything about my issue. FYI, I'm running macOS 10.11 (El Capitan).\n\nA: Yes, a sleeping Mac will prevent your account being logged out.\nFrom a running process or application's perspective, time stops while the computer is asleep. Developers of applications need to actively monitor sleep wake cycles and adjust their timers accordingly. Many applications do not.\nThird Party Tools\nYou can use third party software to log out before sleep or after a period of inactivity.\n\nPower Manager, which is a product I work on, is able to trigger a log out on sleep, after inactivity, or immediately upon wake. Given you are running macOS 10.11, be sure to try the appropriate legacy version.\nBe aware that performing actions on sleep is generally not advisable.\n", "Q: Easiest way to connect two non-thunderbolt monitors to my Macbook Pro 2017 and charge it at the same time? I started a new job working remote recently. I've been provided a Macbook Pro 2017 (EDIT: model is 13\", non-touch, with 2 Thunderbolt ports) and two non-Thunderbolt monitors (Dell P2217H). I have bought two docks/hubs so far, and before I buy a third that still doesn't work how I want, I think I need to ask for help.\nI want to be able to run my two external monitors, with three USB-A peripherals, all with the laptop charging as well. The second hub I bought (this model from Satechi: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XRVX3XM) seemed like it should allow this. It uses both the Macbook's Thunderbolt ports and provides HDMI, Thunderbolt, and USB-C out, along with two USB-A. The monitors have two USB-A ports as well which I thought would work if connected by Thunderbolt.\nHowever, the monitor connected by Thunderbolt doesn't seem to be sending USB-A signals. More significantly, the USB-C port on the hub doesn't work for charging OR for display. Am I doing something wrong? Is a Thunderbolt port needed just to CHARGE the damn thing?\nI found a hub for $500 that passes through both Thunderbolt ports, but that seems like overkill. Is that really what's required to get something like this working? I feel like I have to be missing something because this doesn't seem like an unusual use case at all. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Regarding your Satechi hub and the monitors:\n\"the monitor connected by Thunderbolt doesn't seem to be sending USB-A signals\"\nThis is correct. You're not actually connecting the monitor by Thunderbolt, as the monitor does not support Thunderbolt at all. The monitor supports VGA, DisplayPort and HDMI, so you probably have a USB-C to DisplayPort cable or similar connecting the hub and the monitor. That cable will transfer a picture to the display, but it won't get the USB-A ports on the monitor working. To get the USB-A ports on the monitor working, you need to connect the upstream USB-B port on the monitor to one of the USB ports on your hub.\n\"More significantly, the USB-C port on the hub doesn't work for charging OR for display.\"\nThe USB-C port on the hub is not supposed to work for transferring a display signal. Only the HDMI video output port and the Thunderbolt 3 port on the hub have a display signal in them. This is also visible in the graphics in the link you have provided.\nThe USB-C port on the hub is also not supposed to work for charging. This is listed in the product description on your link: \"Please note the second USB-C port is for data transfer use only.\" - i.e. no power delivery.\nAlternatives\nInstead of the Satechi hub product, you could look a other products that fit your requirements better:\nFor example the OWC Thunderbolt 3 dock takes up a single Thunderbolt 3 port on your laptop - leaving the other one free. It does so while providing a display signal for both monitors, charging your laptop and providing an addition 5 x USB-A ports, 1 x USB-C port, SD-card reader and Ethernet. It is priced at approx. 295$. \nAnother example is the CalDigit Pro Dock that similarly takes up a single Thunderbolt 3 port on your computer while allowing you to connect two displays, charge the laptop and have access to 3 x USB-A ports, 1 x USB-C, Ethernet and SD card reader. It is priced at approx. 200$.\nMultiple similar Thunderbolt 3 docks exists at various price points from various manufacturers. \n\nA: The Satechi product you referenced of just a port expander, it’s not really a dock. \nPrerequisites\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS doesn’t support daisy chaining of displays so you’ll need a Thunderbolt port for each display (the Mac hardware supports it as it works in Windows via Bootcamp)\n\n*One Thunderbolt port must be used for charging. \n\n*The Dell monitors don’t support charging\n\n\nSee the following for more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook with Lenovo C-Dock duplicates image on external monitors\n\n*Can the current model MacBook Pro (2017) 15\" power 3 Displays from one port?\n\n*How do different methods of connecting USB-C display work?\nSolution\nTo meet your goals of hooking up two monitors and charging simultaneously while navigating the above limitations you will need the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charging dock with display like the Caldigit TS3 Plus\n\n*USB-C to DisplayPort cable (the One that came with the monitor is sufficient)\n\n", "Q: Files corrupted after converting HFS+ volume to encrypted APFS Recently I attempted to convert a (non-boot) hard drive I use for backups from HFS+ to APFS (encrypted). I started by converting the drive to APFS (not encrypted):\ndiskutil apfs convert /Volumes/Archive\n\nI don't remember clearly, but I think I used the Disk Utility app for that step, not the command line. This appeared to go through quite quickly and successfully. All good. Next I ran a command to encrypt the volume:\ndiskutil apfs encryptVolume disk7s1 -user disk \n\nI entered a new encryption key when prompted and proceeded to start the encryption process. I definitely did this step on the command line. I don't have the terminal output anymore, but it didn't return any errors and appeared to be working as expected.\nIn addition to various backup copies of files stored elsewhere, the drive contains an HFS+ formatted disk image (Backup.sparsebundle) that is used as a Time Machine backup destination. I noticed that this disk image had become unmounted in the process of converting and encrypting the disk, so I tried to remount it. To my surprise and alarm, this caused macOS to crash hard and reboot.\nAfter rebooting I checked in on the disk encryption process, which appeared to be still in progress:\nContainer disk7 E0...\n====================================================\nAPFS Container Reference:     disk7\nSize (Capacity Ceiling):      4000443056128 B (4.0 TB)\nMinimum Size:                 2472421744640 B (2.5 TB)\nCapacity In Use By Volumes:   2396837355520 B (2.4 TB) (59.9% used)\nCapacity Not Allocated:       1603605700608 B (1.6 TB) (40.1% free)\n|\n+-< Physical Store disk6s2 D2...\n|   -----------------------------------------------------------\n|   APFS Physical Store Disk:   disk6s2\n|   Size:                       4000443056128 B (4.0 TB)\n|\n+-> Volume disk7s1 B7...\n    ---------------------------------------------------\n    APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk7s1 (No specific role)\n    Name:                      Archive (Case-insensitive)\n    Mount Point:               /Volumes/Archive\n    Capacity Consumed:         2396365815808 B (2.4 TB)\n    Encryption Progress:       10.0% (Unlocked)\n\nAfter observing for a while I thought the encryption had stalled, but after hours it progressed to 11.0%, so I assume it is encrypting the drive in the background...very slowly. A week later it's only at 32.0%. Very slow indeed.\nUnfortunately, while the directory structure is intact, the files on the drive are unreadable. Maybe this is why the disk image did not mount and caused a hard crash? For example, there is a text file that contains logs from an rsync job that appears to be corrupted. Opening it with vim it shows no content and an error message in the status bar:\n\"/Volumes/Archive/rsync-stats.txt\" [readonly][READ ERRORS] 0L, 0C\n\nI am able to view the (uncorrupted) content of some files with iBoysoft Data Recovery.app, although contrary to what the website says, the program will not recover files for free. Some of the files that I was able to preview with iBoysoft a week ago now appear to be corrupted, even when previewed with iBoysoft—maybe this is due to the encryption process? None of them have ever been viewable outside of iBoysoft since the drive was encrypted. Was this corruption caused by a bug in APFS encryption?\nVerifying the drive with diskutil shows no errors (ran this a few minutes ago):\n$ sudo diskutil verifyVolume disk7s1\nPassword:\nStarted file system verification on disk7s1 Archive\nVerifying file system\nVolume was successfully unmounted\nPerforming fsck_apfs -n -x /dev/rdisk7s1\nChecking volume\nChecking the container superblock\nChecking the EFI jumpstart record\nChecking the space manager\nChecking the object map\nChecking the APFS volume superblock\nChecking the object map\nChecking the fsroot tree\nChecking the snapshot metadata tree\nChecking the extent ref tree\nChecking the snapshots\nVerifying allocated space\nThe volume /dev/rdisk7s1 appears to be OK\nFile system check exit code is 0\nRestoring the original state found as mounted\nFinished file system verification on disk7s1 Archive\n\nUnfortunately I do not have a backup of my backup drive. And yes, it was silly to do this without making a backup first. It's not the end of the world if I lose the files, but I'd rather not lose them if I don't have to.\nThe machine is running macOS 10.13.6\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I recover the data on this drive, preferably with tools from Apple or the open source community? How?\n\n*Is there a way to tell macOS to prioritize the encryption process to speed things up? 32% after a week is pretty sad, and most of the time the computer is sitting idle, so it has lots of resources to spare.\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\n*Are there tools to troubleshoot what went wrong with the encryption process that caused files on the drive to become unreadable?\n\n\nA: There are multiple challenges with the process you have gone through.\nFirst of the entire premise of converting the drive seems to be a bad idea. You're using Time Machine for backups and want to convert the drive to APFS. But Time Machine doesn't support APFS at all - so even if you get the drive converted fully and correctly, then it won't work with Time Machine afterwards.\nRegarding backup process: This process is indeed slow (or at least time consuming). There's no real way of telling macOS to speed things up, but you can ensure that the computer hasn't got much else to do. I have also seen that simply moving the mouse pointer around a little has a positive effect on the speed. Note that you can use the drive as usual while it is encrypting, and there's nothing that will be \"fixed\" by the drive finishing encryption.\nYou ask if the corruption occured due to a bug in APFS encryption. While it is possible, it doesn't sound very likely no. Most likely you had a pre-existing problem.\nWhether or not you can recover data from the drive is impossible to say from your question. You can use various recovery tools and/or third party recovery services, they might be able to recover some of your data - but there are no guarantees.\nAll in all I think your experiences indicate that you have a hardware problem with your drive. I would suggest immediately shutting down your computer (you should really have done this a week ago when the problems started, but that's too late now). After shutting it down, use a different computer to take a bit-for-bit copy of the drive contents. Then run your data recovery programs, etc. on the copy instead of the original drive.\nIf you end up wiping the drive and starting over, I would suggest very thoroughly testing the drive before assuming it works. Again, it could very likely be a hardware problem with the drive.\n\nA: The answer is: wait for it. No really, that's the answer, just wait for the encryption to get to 100%. It took a very long time (over a month! in my case), but now that the encryption process is complete I'm happy to report that all of the files on the drive are readable again. I have no explanation for why the files were unreadable while encryption was in progress. I don't think it's supposed to work that way.\n", "Q: MacOSX El Capitan - Running bootstrap-vcpkg.sh results in a build stopped: subcommand failed, any solutions?

For my use case it is sufficient, but I don''t think it's the best solution. Hopefully someone (see @Allan's comments in OP) can come up with a more universal solution.\nI added the -e option to my rsync statement which allows you to specify the exact ssh command used.\nrsync -auvzP  -e \"ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_scripts\" '/Volumes/Norman Data/me/Documents' me@example.com:backup/\n\nThe important part in there is ~/.ssh/id_rsa_scripts - I generated a secondary set of keys for that server, with this set having no passphrase. This is different from how I connect to that box via SSH by default and thus why it needed to be specified in the rsync command.\nThat was the only way I could get it to work when running unattended (as a Global Daemon). Although it is ok under my set of circumstances, a passphrase-less key is not the best idea in many situations, which is why this is not the ** best ** solution. \nHopefully someone can figure out a way to allow launchd to execute a script requiring SSH authentication using keys with a passphrase. \n", "Q: how to ignore all the node_modules folders from time machine How to add the node_modules folder paths to time machine ignore paths.\nThese folders are like tmp data for backups. These are very dense folders and also slow down TM.\nIs there is a txt file which can be appended?\nMaybe a command line which can append to the config.\n\nA: There're several approaches mentioned in this gist.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using tmutil addexclusion\nfind `pwd` -type d -maxdepth 3 -name 'node_modules' | xargs -n 1 tmutil addexclusion\n\n\n\n*Using tmignore which automatically finds all Git repositories on your disk and excludes all paths matching .gitignore files. I've just tried it and it works great. You can also set up a script to check your disk periodically.\n\n\nA: You can manage the list of ignored folders in the Time Machine preferences.\n\n\nA: I'm one of the maintainers of Asimov, a free macOS utility for automatically excluding development dependencies from Time Machine backups (npm, Composer, RubyGems, and more). It was designed for this very purpose ::looks begrudgingly at node_modules/::\nThe easiest way to install Asimov is via Homebrew (brew install asimov), but the GitHub repo also has manual installation instructions. Once installed, a cron job runs every day to find development dependencies and automatically exclude them from Time Machine via tmutil (mentioned above).\nOne more benefit is that Asimov checks for the dependency declarations (in the case of node_modules/, a package.json file) before excluding the directory from backups.\n\nA: You can leverage tmutil Time Machine utility for managing such exclusions. Note that in more recent versions of macOS you might need to add the fixed path -p switch to tmutil as well as hold root privileges. Also, you need to enable \"Full Disk Access\" privileges for Terminal beforehand, otherwise the following appears when running tmutil separately:\n\ntmutil: addexclusion requires Full Disk Access privileges. To allow\nthis operation, select Full Disk Access in the Privacy tab of the\nSecurity & Privacy preference pane, and add Terminal to the list of\napplications which are allowed Full Disk Access.\n\nfind pwd -type d -maxdepth 3 -name 'node_modules' | xargs -n 1 sudo tmutil addexclusion -p\nPS. Because TM's config does not allow for regular expressions, you need to rerun this command whenever you create new project directories that needs similar exclusion.\n", "Q: Stuck on reinstallation of OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan When I trigger the reinstallation of OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan while in Recovery Mode starting \"Reinstall OS X\" the InstallAssistant immediately fails:\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: @(#)PROGRAM:Install  PROJECT:Install-1000\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: @(#)PROGRAM:IA  PROJECT:InstallAssistant-532\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Hardware: MacBookPro12,1 @ 3.10 GHz (x 4), 8192 MB RAM\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Running OS Build: Mac OS X 10.11.6 (15G31)\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: DYLD_NO_FIX_PREBINDING=1\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: PWD=/\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: XPC_FLAGS=0x0\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: XPC_SERVICE_NAME=0\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: SHLVL=1\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: __OSINSTALL_ENVIRONMENT=1\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: CI_DEFAULT_OPENCL_USAGE=0\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: OS_INSTALL=1\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Env: _=/System/Library/CoreServices/Language Chooser.app/Contents/MacOS/Language Chooser\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: Can not connect to /var/run/systemkeychaincheck.socket: No such file or directory\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: OSInstallChunkedDownload loaded...\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: OSInstallChunkedDownload loaded...\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: IAPisaDownload loaded...\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro InstallAssistant[458]: IAPisaDownload loaded...\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro Unknown[420]: 2020-03-16 00:52:25.770 InstallAssistant[458:14619] NSColorList could not parse color list file /System/Library/Colors/System.clr\nMar 16 00:52:25 MacBook-Pro Unknown[420]: 2020-03-16 00:52:25.779 InstallAssistant[458:14619] Failed to connect (keyReceivingView) outlet from (IASetupWindowController) to (PUKDiskPickerHorizontalView): missing setter or instance variable\n\nWhen I look at the above message Can not connect to /var/run/systemkeychaincheck.socket: No such file or directory I guess the issue might be related to the current SIP setting, which is \"enabeled\".\nQuestion\n Should I rerun the job with SIP switched off?

Earlier this year, I had to email a colleague to ask them to send me some information I was waiting for. They insisted they'd sent it already but I couldn't find the email in Mail.app (both iOS and Mac) or Gmail.\nThe same thing happened today. A different colleague emailed me over the weekend. I saw the message arrive in my inbox on Saturday but didn't open it. This morning, I couldn't find it so I emailed the colleague asking them to send the info believing I might have imagined it the first time. The colleage replied. After reading the reply on my phone, I went to my mac, opened Mail and the message wasn't there! I couldn't find it on my phone or the Gmail web app either. I looked in junk and trash as well but still couldn't find it.\nI've tried rebuilding the mailbox but the missing messgae is still missing.\nIt's a bit worrying as I do all my business over email. Why do my emails disappear sometimes? What can I do to prevent them from disappearing?\n(From time to time, I hear the incoming mail alert but there's no new email in my inbox. Could that be related?)\n\nA: It isn't in the nature of email itself for emails to go missing.\nThis means that mails go missing either because:\n(a) someone is accessing your account and deleting the mail,\n(b) there's a server problem where data is lost,\nor\n(c) software has been setup to intentionally delete emails\nYou indicate that you're using Gmail, but also Mail.app on iOS and Mac. If you store your email on Gmail exclusively, it doesn't sound likely that (b) happens several times for you.\nIf your account is secure and you haven't shared your password with anyone else, I don't think the problem is related to (a) either.\nSo the most likely culprit is reason (c). This could be a spam filter, antivirus/antimalware software, etc. that is setup to identify and delete suspicious emails. As you're using multiple clients to access mail, this could have been setup directly on Gmail, in Mail.app on your Mac or on an iOS client.\n", "Q: USB C, HDMI Switch for MacBook Pro/Mac Mini I know nothing about KVM switches, but they seem to be what I need to easily swap between my home computer and my work laptop on my HDMI Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse.\nI bought https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M66SD79/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 but when I swapped to the MacBook Pro which is USB-C only nothing worked. I'm currently using it for the Mac Mini, but I need a solution that actually lets me switch between both.\nI'm not really interested in having it act as a power supply for either because those are seem wildly expensive and I already have power supplies for them.\nIf I have to: https://www.aten.com/global/en/products/usb-&-thunderbolt/docking-switches/us3310/ seems as though it would work, but they seem focused on having a latop and smartphone plugged in. Not a laptop and mac mini. Power supply seems concerning here.\n\nA: Keyboard and mouse only\nOnly taking into account the keyboard and mouse you can perhaps use software to share those with multiple devices instead of hardware.\nSynergy can do this, but is currently paid.\nThe last free version is 1.8.8 and is available at sourceforge.\nScreen, keyboard and mouse\nAlternatively you can access one machine (e.g. the Mac Mini) via remote desktop from the other (e.g. the MacBook Pro). If they're on the same local network and depending on the use case the speed should be very acceptable.\nI'm not affiliated with Synergy, just a happy user.\n\nA: One place I did some contract IT work used StarTech KVM switches and I liked them.  https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/\nI suggest looking through their product line for something that meets your needs.  The prices listed on their direct order site is often quite a bit higher than from the distributors they deal with so shopping around can save some bucks.  None of the KVM switches StarTech offers has USB-C ports, and very few KVM switches will. Get the Apple Digital AV multi-port adapter, or any of a number of similar \"mini-docks\" to break out the USB-C port on your MacBook into USB-A, HDMI, and USB-C/power.  I just got this one today:  https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/TCDK5PRG/\nIt's cheap (and pink) but so far is working as advertised.\nPersonally I've tried a number of software KVM solutions and they don't seem to work all that well and I keep going back to my old KVMs.  The KVMs I have use VGA for video but they work nicely.  At some point I'll have to get something that uses HDMI or DP for video.  One of my KVMs uses a big mechanical knob on the front to select the computer, I like it because there's no boot up time, no power needed, and switches quickly.  Nobody makes switches like that any more, at least none I've seen.  My other KVM uses keyboard macros to switch which is nice since my fingers never leave the keyboard.  StarTech uses a similar keyboard macro switching on all the KVMs I've seen from them, and most also have buttons on the front to switch as well.\nI'm not stuck on StarTech KVMs, they are simply the only one I've dealt with and are still in business.

There is a special keybinding for transposing two characters in a text field: ctrl-t. Is this functionality really that useful to deserve a keybinding? I want to know what I am missing by not using it.\nSide question: Can I remap ctrl-t to something else using for example terminal?\n\nA: There’s about a gazillion and 3 Emacs keybindings. You’re not missing out on anything if you don’t use it. Why is it there?  It came with the technologies that Apple acquired that made the basis of OS X. \nWhat you should remember is that Emacs was born in a world that didn’t have advanced editors like we have and take for granted now. You’ve already developed your “workflow” on how to deal with typos in this modern environment, but way back when, having text transposing functions was a lot easier than taking the editor out of insert mode, putting it into overwrite mode, retyping the characters, then returning to overwrite (yeah, that many steps). \nAs for remapping keys, you can, of course, remap keys. There are many tutorials and software recommendations on this site dealing with that very topic. \n", "Q: Hiding specific window (Enhanced Command+H) Is there a way, native or third party tool, to hide a specific window instead of all Application Windows, which is the current behavior of all macOS versions. \nFor example, when opening multiple Safari windows or Terminal windows, I just want to Command+H one of the windows, not all the application. \nThis is really helpful for multi-monitor setups.\n\nA: This may not be exactly what you are looking for but it is a start.\nIf you want to hide your current front most (active) window simply pressing ⌘ Command M will do that.\nThat is the keyboard equivalent of clicking the yellow \"Minimize\" window button. \nIf you then need to \"un-minimize\" a window that you recently minimized that will require a trip to the mouse and the right size of the dock...\n", "Q: Macbook pro Mid-2012 not booting on battery.

While diagnosing some weird application behaviour on my MacBook Pro and the dreaded \"too many open files\" errors appearing in the shell out of nowhere, I came to find out that ath, an executable component of AirTrafficHost.framework, keeps a huge number of open sockets in CLOSE_WAIT state. The number tends to only increase in time until it hits the system limit for open file descriptors. I use my MBP docked most of the time and it is always on, so the limit is reached after a couple of days.\nAirTrafficHost.framework is a private Apple framework and seems to be part of the wireless communcation with iOS devices. There are two iOS devices for which I've enabled network sync - an iPad Pro and an iPhone. It seems that ath tries to talk to them and at some point the connection is terminated, but the network sockets are never closed and just keep piling up. lsof shows:\nath  627 hristo   7u  IPv6 0x2e106590d5ff22b3  0t0  TCP [fe80:5::xxx]:49280->[fe80:5::yyy]:57461 (CLOSE_WAIT)\nath  627 hristo   8u  IPv6 0x2e106590d6aea413  0t0  TCP [fe80:5::xxx]:49300->[fe80:5::yyy]:57464 (CLOSE_WAIT)\nath  627 hristo  10u  IPv6 0x2e106590d7a65c93  0t0  TCP [fe80:5::xxx]:49529->[fe80:5::yyy]:57482 (CLOSE_WAIT)\nath  627 hristo  11u  IPv6 0x2e106590d4fe9a33  0t0  TCP [fe80:5::xxx]:49574->[fe80:5::yyy]:57486 (CLOSE_WAIT)\nath  627 hristo  13u  IPv6 0x2e106590d5feeb93  0t0  TCP [fe80:5::xxx]:49609->[fe80:5::yyy]:57490 (CLOSE_WAIT)\nath  627 hristo  14u  IPv6 0x2e106590d18e7b93  0t0  TCP [fe80:5::xxx]:49656->[fe80:5::yyy]:57494 (CLOSE_WAIT)\n... many more ...\n\nRight now, it's been 5 hrs since the last reboot and the number of socket descriptors is already 162 in two ath processes (one for each iOS device, I guess) and growing:\n$ lsof -n | grep ^ath | grep TCP | wc -l\n    162\n\nIt also seems that for each disconnect, there is an entry in /var/log/system.log:\nMar 17 01:15:23 MacBook-Pro AMPDeviceDiscoveryAgent[433]: Entered:_AMMuxedDeviceDisconnected, mux-device:159\nMar 17 01:15:23 MacBook-Pro AMPDeviceDiscoveryAgent[433]: Entered:__thr_AMMuxedDeviceDisconnected, mux-device:159\nMar 17 01:15:23 MacBook-Pro AMPDeviceDiscoveryAgent[433]: tid:7387 - Mux ID not found in mapping dictionary\nMar 17 01:15:23 MacBook-Pro AMPDeviceDiscoveryAgent[433]: tid:7387 - Can't handle disconnect with invalid ecid\n\nThe OS is a fully updated macOS Catalina 10.15.3.\nIs anyone else seeing the same problem and are you aware of a solution that does not involve increasing the system limits or performing a clean OS install? I already have a launchd job to increase kern.maxfiles and kern.maxfilesperproc, but that's not really a solution - it just postpones the problem. And I'd prefer not to disable network synchronisation, because I'm out of USB ports.\n\nA: It is actually okay to raise the system limits - for example up to 65536 open files. 162 sockets over 5 hours is a relatively low number. It is not going to affect system performance in any way, and does not use up any kind of significant resources.\nOrdinarily sockets will eventually go away by themselves after a timeout. However in your case, they're listed as being in state CLOSE_WAIT. This means that the kernel is waiting for the application to call close() on the socket descriptor, and they will not go away automatically.\nath is supposed to be doing just that - so it seems like you've either hit a bug, or have some kind of serious misconfiguration that makes ath behave incorrectly.\nAs a temporary measure, you can get the sockets closed by closing the ath process. You can see the process ID in your output from lsof, and then use the kill command to close it up. You can start it again from:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AirTrafficHost.framework/ath\n\n", "Q: Built-in way to mute audio on Catalina?

I download music on the documents app and I wanted to airdrop a song from my iPhone, to iPad. They are both connected so it doesn’t ask and just receives it. And that’s the problem. Idk where it is! I have a files app and documents app on my iPad and I looked and searched for it everywhere. It definitely received it because I heard the sound of when you receive airdropped stuff. I want to find it and delete it so it won’t take up storage. Someone, please help.\n\nA: AirDrop files are stored in the app that matches them. \nFor example, pictures will be saved in your Photos app. A presentation will be saved in Keynote. Contacts will be saved in Contacts. And so on.\nAfter you've sent or received an AirDrop file, check the app that matches the file type to ensure it went to the right place and was saved. It should automatically save and open in that app's files. \n", "Q: iOS Chrome search box changed to \"new tab\" button Google Chrome on my iPhone 8 Plus recently changed the search field at the bottom of the app interface to a \"New Tab\" button.

I'm accustomed to being able to tap my left Airpod to advance to the next track and my right Airpod to toggle pause/play\nI can't seem to find similar features on the Airpod Pros. First there appears to be no tap options only squeeze and second the squeeze options are only noise settings and Siri. Further, squeeze  is not nearly as convenient as tap since I can tap my AirPods with my hands full but can’t squeeze. \nIs there some way to enable the tap options on AirPods Pros or are these really a downgrade from the functionality of the standard AirPods?\n\nA: Tap on AirPods is replaced with a press on the stem (squeeze) on AirPods Pro.\nOn either AirPods Pro stem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Single press for play/pause\n\n*Double press to skip media (next song, etc)\n\n*Triple press to play from start, or if at start, previous media (last song, etc)\n\n*Hold stem for the custom action in Settings, i.e. switch listening mode or start Siri.\n\n\nA: There are no “tap” functions on the AirPods Pro.\nThat is a function of the 1st and 2nd generation AirPods. The AirPods Pro uses a new force sensor that you press (what you call squeeze) to activate its functions. \nYou can get full details from the Apple Support document Connect and Use Your AirPods and AirPods Pro\n\nA: Your issue seems to be that you find the new AirPods pro gestures less convenient than tapping, especially with your hands full.\nOne feature that resolved this really well (which was available on AirPods v2 as well) is the always-on Siri. This provides full hands free control!\nI also think you’ll learn to enjoy the added functionality that the new gestures bring.

There is no evidence that it’s a virus. \n\nWhat are the chances that is will damage the photos on my iPhone?\n\nZero. Did you give permissions to Safari to access your Photos library?  (Is rhetorical because the answer is “no”). Safari (and every app on iOS) is sandboxed such that it cannot access other apps or data without your express consent. Since Safari doesn’t access photos, no website can do anything to them. \n", "Q: Why does iOS Speak Selection read \"2020\" as \"2020 inches\" in English (UK)? I've been using Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Speak Selection to read some articles from various websites on my iOS 13.3.1 iPhone 8. Whenever it reads \"2020\" (without the quotes), it says \"inches\" afterwards. This seems to happen with all the UK English voices. I don't have any custom pronunciations configured, and changing the Speaking Rate doesn't affect it. As an experiment, I wrote the following in Notes. I've annotated it with what the screen reader says:\n2019    // two thousand and nineteen\n2020    // twenty twenty inches\n2021    // two thousand and twenty one\n1010    // one thousand and ten\n2010    // two thousand and ten\n1020    // one thousand and twenty\n5050    // five thousand and fifty\n202020  // two hundred and two thousand and twenty\n20.20   // twenty dot twenty\n20:20   // twenty twenty\n\"2020\"  // twenty twenty\n'2020'  // twenty twenty\n\nI can't think of any cultural reason that 2020 without quotes would automatically mean inches, and only in the UK. Can anyone explain it?\n\nA: It's likely a bug, as I can't duplicate the behaviour in Notes on a Mac. \nHowever, the reason for the confusion may be that ' and '' symbols are used as a shorthand for feet and inches (also for minutes and seconds in geographical co-ordinates). \nPerhaps Notes thinks there is a double quote after the numbers?\n", "Q: iTerm2 error notification ‘Couldn't log to 2020…’ Every time I open a new window iTerm2 says \"Couldn't log to …\"\n\nI restarted my Mac which is on High Sierra but the problem continues.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: You've got an invalid or inaccessible log path.\nFrom iTerm Preferences → Profiles → your profile → Session, disable ‘Automatically log session input to files in’ or set the path correctly using the Change button.\n\n\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/8672#note_284043217\n", "Q: Applescript activate not making the application fully active I'm writing a script for an application that does not support scripting.

When I'm activating it in an applescript, it brings its main window to the foreground, but the window is still not fully active (e.g. the Close/Minimize/Fullscreen buttons are grey, the shadow around the window is faint, etc). I have to click on it or cmd-tab twice to get it to activate.

Recovery volumes are read only and you can't install things to that, not that I think you're wanting to anyway.\nIn recovery, your normal volumes are mounted to folders within /Volumes/.

The man files for dig, delv and host all contain:  \"macOS Notice The [dig | delv | host] command does not use the host name and address resolution or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by other processes running on macOS.\"\nI've only found this, apparently, non-authoritative mechanism answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/70583/246634\nThe dscacheutil man page does not document that one can make an authoritative DNS query using dscacheutil.\nHow does one make a command line authoritative DNS query using macOS Mojave native host name and address resolution mechanism(s)?\n\nA: The way to do a command line DNS query using macOS Mojave's native host name and address resolution mechanism is through dscacheutil like this:\ndscacheutil -q host -a name www.google.com\n\nThis will use the native mechanism so that the response will come from cache, if it is cached, and if not it will be looked up through standard address resolution (i.e. typically from a recursive DNS server) and the answer will be placed in cache.\nI suspect that you already know of this method, and thus have added the word \"authoritative\" to the title of your question to specify that you want to lookup the address directly from the authoritative DNS server instead of through a recursive DNS server for example.\nUnfortunately this makes the question a kind of oxymoron - i.e. it doesn't really make sense. Because if you're using the native address resolution mechanism like most normal macOS programs, you're not just making a query to an authoritative DNS server - you're interacting with a cache and its address resolution policy.\nIf you want to make an authoritative query from the command line on macOS Mojave, you can do that by the following command for example:\ndig @a.r06.twtrdns.net www.twitter.com\n\nThis means that the query goes directly to the authoritative DNS server. Ofcourse this bypasses the standard way of resolving names, so this doesn't interact with macOS Mojave's native address resolution mechanism.\nI hope this answer your question even though it doesn't try to answer the impossible \"both at the same time\". But perhaps you meant something else, which wasn't clear in your question. Perhaps you're looking to query the cache and recursive servers through the native address resolution mechanism, but only to get at the authoritative section of the DNS reply (if any DNS reply is involved at all ofcourse) - or something like that.\n", "Q: Disk Utility fails with OSStatus error 22 during cloning/recovery operation Background:\nI need to upgrade the drive in my Macbook Pro. Following are some of its specs:  \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (17-inch, Late 2011)\n\n*OS: High Sierra, v 10.13.6  \n\n*HDD: 500 GB SSD, w/ Macintosh HD & BOOTCAMP partitions\n\n\nThe Problem:\nI need to upgrade the SSD to 1TB. I can accomplish this by cloning the 500GB drive to the 1TB drive. I will use Disk Utility from the Recovery HD volume to do this since both source and destination volumes in the cloning process will need to be unmounted. \nI did this previously when upgrading the original mechanical HDD to SSD, but it was HFS-to-HFS. I quickly reviewed this article to verify nothing had changed. Finding no warnings, cautions or surprises, I began the process: \n\n\n*\n\n*boot with command-R to get into the Recovery HD volume\n\n*start Disk Utility\n\n*select Restore option\n\n*designate source (500GB) & destination (1TB) drives\n\n*Go! \n\n\nThis ran overnight (many hours). But instead of seeing a \"Success\" message this morning, I saw an error: \nInverting target volume...  \nAPFS inverter failed to invert the volume - invalid argument\nThe operation couldn't be completed. (OSStatus error 22.)\nOperation failed...  \n\nResearch on this led me here. I initially concluded Apple had simply not upgraded the Recovery volume or the apps in it, but this proved not to be the case. Here's what I've found:  \n\n  \n*\n  \n*The upgrade to High Sierra converted the 'primary' volume to APFS, but left the Recovery volume as HFS.\n  \n*The version of Disk Utility (DU) in the Recovery volume of my MBP is the same version as DU in my 'primary' High Sierra volume - it was apparently upgraded concurrently with the High Sierra upgrade.\n  \n*Whatever the version of DU in the Recovery volume, the failure I experienced seems rather chronic.\n\nThe source disk is a Crucial SSD, a few years old & no known issues; the destination disk as also a Crucial SSD - about a week old. Nevertheless, I have now checked all volumes on both disks with First Aid in DU, and all are reported as \"OK\". \nBased on all the above, I've concluded that my Recovery volume is unreliable and not fit for purpose. \nI've found a 3rd party alternative solution, Carbon Copy Cloner. It has now successfully cloned the 500GB drive, and restored that to the new 1TB drive - I am \"whole\" again :)  My questions (at last) are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Can the Recovery HD volume be upgraded - perhaps by installing a later version of Disk Utility from Mojave or Catalina, or a 3rd party app such as CCC? \n\n*Could the Recovery HD volume be converted from HFS to APFS and restored/installed on the internal SSD? \n\n*Can a Recovery HD volume be created on a thumb drive which could be made bootable? \n\nA: I came here because I was looking for solutions about the error you quote, but instead your actual questions at the end of your text are about something else. It would be nice if you'd change your question title accordingly.\nTo answer your questions about recovery partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you install, even temporarily, a newer macOS, you should get a newer recovery partition along with it. I, for instance, have a separate 10.14.6 recovery system on one of my Macs (however, I wonder how that came to be, as there's also a Recovery APFS volume insider the container where the Mojave system resides, so why would there also be a HFS+ partition with one?). Be aware that if you install a newer system on your current system disk, it might convert your current system volume from HFS to APFS. To prevent that, install it to a separate partition (though even then I'm not sure that Apple won't simply convert all volumes on the disk to APFS), or best install it to an external disk.\n\n*Converting it into APFS is not needed and inadvisible - it would not gain you anything. Basically, the Recovery system is just a small EFI-based loader that'll then load the BaseSystem image into a RAM disk and load the Recovery system from there.\n\n*I have copied entire HFS+-formatted recovery partitions to external USB disks, so I assume you could as well copy them onto a USB stick, as long as you format it with a GUID partition scheme first. The copy operation may be tricky, though - ideally, Disk Utility should let you do that with its Restore command - but it turns that that the new Disk Utility won't even show Recovery partitions any more, so that's not an option. The old Disk Utility from pre-10.11 systems may be able to, still.\nHere's what still works in my testing on Mojave with Terminal commands to copy a HFS+ formatted Recovery partition to an USB thumb drive (with GUID partition scheme):\nasr --source /dev/diskVsW --target /dev/diskXsY --erase\n\nWhere diskVsW and diskXsY are the identifiers for the source and dest Recovery partitions that you'll find with diskutil list.\nYou could also use hdiutil to create an image file of another Mac's recovery partition and then later restore that with Disk Utility.\nAlso keep in mind that modern Macs can always load a recovery system from the internet, so there's no need to keep one around for them.\n", "Q: mdfind tool : consider in the same time, to perform researching of files, a substring of the filename and the insensitive case for these substrings Is it possible to specify, in the context of files searching on my MacOS Catalina 10.15.3, a way  to combine in the same time a potential substring of filename and the case insensitive of this substring ?\nFor the moment, I know the command :\n1) mdfind -name 'substring'for the substring\n2) mdfind 'kMDItemFSName == substring for insensitive case\nBut I wonder if I can combine them (like the classical locate -i substring command).\nUPDATE 1 : I can't explain the bad working of my mdfind command compared to classical command locate.

How do I find the physical hard drives they refer to? I have to change out the hard drives in Raid 1 array. But all the hard drives have the same name in DiskUtility app because they are all the same type of drives from the same manufacturer.\nSo how can I find out which drive is failing?\nI mean, how can I tell which physical drive is referred to by each DiskUtility drive name?\n@Allen, thank you for your interest.\nI have a Mac Pro running Mojave that has 4 drive slots. The first slot holds a 1TB Intel Server SSD with the MacOS installed. There are also three 2TB WD 3.5\" SATA Drives that were originally configured in a 6TB Raid 5 array. \nDisk Util list reveals that the three SATA drives are all the same WD Model number. \nOne of the SATA Drives in the raid array failed and I took it out of the raid array and mirrored the remaining two drives as a raid 1 array.\nRecently, one of the two mirrored drives also 'failed' from the perspective of the raid array. \nWhat I need to do is disconnect both of the 'failed' drives from the raid and copy the data on the remaining SATA drive to an external drive to preserve it and replace the data on a single new SATA Drive, then add two more SATA Drives and re-create a new Raid 5 Array.\nSo again, my question is: how do I distinguish which physical SATA drive is referred to by the remaining WD drives listed in disk util list is the remaining 'good' drive in the disk util listing that contains my valuable data.\nTherefore I believe the question I asked is a proper explanation of the information I am seeking:\nhow can I tell which physical drive is referred to by each Disk Utility list drive name?\nThat is, I think the question does not require any information about the drives or their configuration, or their history, or the problems I am having.\nEither there is a way for MacOS to tell me which physical drive bay contains which logical drive listed in disk util list, or MacOS has no way of revealing the correspondence between the Logical List of drives in Disk Util and the physical drives attached to the system.\nIf Mojave cannot tell me which logical drive is which physical drive, then I need to know if there is another utility which will reveal the correspondence.\nDoes that make sense?\nThanks,\nKimball\n\nA: The method I use is to grab the serial number from the drive. This information is usually printed by the factory on a label on the physical disk so that it is easy to identify.\nStart by ensuring you have HomeBrew installed. Then run the following command to install smartmontools:\nbrew install smartmontools\n\nThen grab the serial number from the failing drive:\nsmartctl -a /dev/disk2\n\nThis assumes that the failing disk is /dev/disk2 - obviously change that to reflect the disk you have ben reported as failing.\nIn the output you'll find something like:\nSerial Number: C8AF902EAB39\n\n(format varies depending on manufacturer)\nYou should be able to match that up with the label on the drive.\n\nA: You can do this from Terminal with the system_profiler command:\n$ system_profiler SPSerialATADataType\n\nIt will generate a list of all SATA drives attached to your Mac.

Essentially this means that an application can inform the dtrace system of events happening inside the application to provide high-level tracing capabilities for the user.\nI.e. instead of generic events like system calls or signals, it is possible for software such as for example a database engine to provide dtrace with information such as \"SQL query started\" or \"Query plan computed\" or what ever the application developer wants.\nIt is not \"used\" as such by ordinary users - you use it through the software you installed that then makes information available in dtrace through the helper device.\nIf you are a developer, I would suggest reading the following documentation on how to add application-specific probes to your program:\nhttp://dtrace.org/guide/chp-usdt.html#chp-usdt\nIf you really want to manually access /dev/dtracehelper, I suggest looking at the source:\nhttps://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927/bsd/sys/dtrace.h\n(line 1488 and onwards, also take a look at the corresponding .c file)\nIn particular you would want to initialize data structures such as dof_ioctl_data with dof_helper substructures, and use ioctl() with DTRACEHIOC_ADDDOF and others.\nYou can find an example of doing this here:\nhttps://github.com/trentm/hello-json-logging/blob/master/node_modules/restify/node_modules/dtrace-provider/libusdt/usdt_dof_file.c\n", "Q: How to launch a Spotlight deeplink from JXA?

Command-J gets you to the option quicker.\nIf space is being used in hidden files or directories, you can view those with Finder's Shift-Command-period shortcut. It's a toggle.\nFolders to check would be your Desktop, Downloads and tmp.

I'm new to Mac and it seems that on Mac OS Catalina, undoing some text deletion via the keyboard shortcut command + z also selects the text that was re-added. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type something\n\n*Delete the last word using option + delete\n\n*Undo the deletion using cmd + z\n\n*Observe that the last word is selected\n\n\nThis is a little annoying, as I need to explicitly unselect the text before typing again, otherwise I overwrite the text I was trying to add back.\nIs there a way to make it so command + z does not select the text it adds back?\n\nA: As @Tetsujin pointed out, it turns out this is a per-application behavior, not an OS behavior. The same happens in some programs on Windows, and some apps on Mac do not behave like this. Seems like nothing can be done about it.\n", "Q: How exactly does an App Store developer add support for earlier versions of iOS? I just recently published my first iOS app to the App Store, but I want it to support devices with older iOS versions, and would like to confirm how to add that support before I do something that might mess things up.\nOn testing downloading from the App Store, I discovered that having left the iOS Deployment Target setting to the latest iOS version (currently 13.2), seems to mean that only users with the latest version of iOS on their devices are allowed to actually download the app.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a version 1.0.1 targeting iOS 13.2 on the store.\n\n\nI think what I need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Build another archive targeting iOS 12.0 with a higher version number (required to upload after the previous one) and post it to the store.\n\n*And if I also want to support iOS 11.0, add another archive built for that with a higher version number, and upload that too.\n\n*Then make sure they're all listed as available under App Store Connect -> my app -> Pricing and Availability -> Last-Compatible Version Settings.\nIs that all I have to do? Is it going to mess something up that the older iOS targets will have higher version numbers of my App?\n\nA: It doesn't mess something up that you have newer version numbers that support older iOS targets than older version numbers. That's perfectly alright.\nRemember that the Deployment Target is the minimum version of iOS that user's need to have.\nThe optimal way to do what you want is to set the deployment target to iOS 11, and then in your app conditionally use features for iOS 12 and iOS 13 depending on their availability.\nThis means that you can compile one single archive that contains a single app that will install on iOS 11, iOS 12 and iOS 13, and will offer different functionality depending on the iOS version on the user's device.\nIf you're using Swift for example, it could look something like this:\nif #available(iOS 13, *) {\n  // new stuff\n} else {\n  // old stuff\n}\n\n\nA: If you build and upload with bytecode enabled Apple can generate the various IPA files for all the target devices and operating system versions.\n", "Q: Prompted to enter system lock PIN code to unlock Mac A former terminated employee Fedex'ed us his company Macbook Air.

They are supposed to be automatically deleted when you close the document in Word or Excel, but sometimes that mechanism fail.\nThese files are not \"corrupted\" - they're simply not supposed to be able to be opened with Word/Excel.

I have an external disk always backing up my system, since Time Machine was launched.\nNot the same disk all these years.\nCatalina introduce this thing called APFS local snapshot that wastes disk space by creating backups on the main disk.\nAlso Catalina now split macOS into 2 partitions: Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - Data.\nHere is my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have Time Machine backing up the main disk to USB disk.\n\n*I have local snapshots being created on the main disk.\n\n\nFirst question: macOS has these 2 partitions, Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - Data, I type tmutil listlocalsnapshots / and I see this\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2020-03-18-114726.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2020-03-18-134519.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2020-03-18-144256.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2020-03-18-154141.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2020-03-18-164459.local\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2020-03-19-022806.local\n\nThese are snapshots that contain data from both Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - Data, right?\nSecond question: I am having this other error explained on another question of mine.\nThat local snapshot I mention, from 3 days ago, doesn't appear today when I listed the local snapshots. Probably they have been alreay erased.\nThird question: these snapshots mentioned by fsck_apfs and Disk Utility.app are those APFS local snapshots, right?\nFourth question: When I open the Time Machine application and it shows a list of all backups Time Machine has by date, what backups am I seeing there, the ones on the external disk or these local snapshots.\nFifth question: What is the relation between these local snapshots and the backup being made to external disk?\nSixth question: If the local snapshots and the backups being made to external disks are independent, how do I rollback the disk to a previous local snapshot?\nThanks, please answer these six questions.\n\nA: Both are backup utilities and both offer you the ability to recover after a \"catastrophic\" event, but like tools in your tool box, your box wrench and your socket wrench both essentially have the same function, but have their preferred application depending on the scenario.\n\n*\n\n*APFS snapshots are a point-in-time snapshot of your APFS file system.  Your initial TM backup may be a point in time snapshot, but subsequently, it's an ongoing differential backup - only backing up what has changed.\n\n\n*APFS snapshots are only done on drives that have the APFS file system. Time Machine will back up any supported drive, APFS or not.\n\n\n*APFS are not so automatic.  Yes, they are done automatically prior to an update being applied and you can script them using launchd or cron, but they're generally something that gets done only before a major system change.  Time Machine on the other hand, by its very nature not only runs on schedule, but runs continuously to ensure data protection.\n\n\n*APFS snapshots are stored to the local APFS drive.  This means that you need to have ample space to take a snapshot.  TM doesn't care how full your drive is to take a backup as long as you have a target drive big enough to back it up.\n\n\n*Since APFS snapshots are only stored on disks with the APFS filesystem, when you run out of space, earlier snapshots are automatically deleted.  While this is also the behavior for TM, you can easily add to your backup space by swapping out another external back up drive.\nTL;DR\nAPFS snapshots should not be used as a method of backup because they are only point-in-time snapshots of your system.  This is useful if you are about to do an update or make a change and things go sideways and you need the ability to return to a known working state.\nTime Machine offers true back up capabilities because it offers more than a point-in-time backup, but an ongoing differential backup where it gives you granular control of what you back up and restore regardless of filesystem.\n", "Q: Is Screen Sharing Version 1.7.2 on MacOS Catalina an Encrypted Connection? I can't find info from Apple on this...I typically connect via ip address and port forwarding. Is this a fully encrypted connection or do I need to configure an SSH tunnel? \n\nA: The server software on macOS Catalina does support encryption, but your client needs to support encryption too.\nIf you're using a standard VNC client to connect with a password only, nothing is encrypted. Not even the password. In this case I would recommend an SSH tunnel as you propose, or other forms of encryption such as an encrypted VPN, encrypted tunnel or similar.\nIf you're using the Screen Sharing app on macOS 10.8 (Mountain Lion) or later to connect with a username/password or AppleID, everything is encrypted.\n", "Q: Import sound file into Music memos Is there a way to import an audio file (of either format) into Music Memos on iOS?\nI want to try to utilize the “automatic” drums of the app on some older guitar recordings. From what I can tell, the drum function listens to a memo and tries to play along, so wouldn’t it be neat if we could hand it a recording from another source and tell it “Here, put drums on this”?\nI’ve been looking through the iPhone file structure in PhoneView, but I fear I lack the deeper understanding. Otherwise, copying a recording with the right format into where Music memos stores recordings, I imagine one could convince the app that this is a legit memo file. You know?\n\nA: *\n\n*Your music file must be a .caf file.\n\n*Open Settings → Music Memos and see what the ‘Use iCloud’ switch is set to.\nYou don't need to change it, just keep it in mind for step 5.\n\n*Find your music file in the Files app, such as in the Downloads folder if it came from Safari.\n\n*Long press the file and choose Move (or Copy).\n\n*If the switch in step 2 was on, find Music Memos under ‘iCloud Drive’.\nIf the switch was off, find Music Memos under ‘On This iPhone’.\n\n*Move/copy the file to that location.\n\nThis worked for me with a test caf file and iOS 13.5.\n", "Q: Creating SHA-2 certificate using keychain assistant I am trying to enable https on my localhost (for testing).

When I access my local website using Safari, I get a message warning me that certificate is not trusted and a link to instructions on how to trust the certificate via Keychain Assistant.\nI thought the purpose of setting trust on the CA was to not need to explicitly trust the certificates it issues.

When I review the certificate info, its fingerprint appears to be using SHA-1.  I cannot figure out how to create an SHA-2 certificate using Keyboard Assistant.\nCan anyone tell me where this hidden capability lies?  Or did Apple create a certificate requirement that its own tool cannot comply with?\n\nA: Turns out this was just my misunderstanding of how to read the certificate info and the various SHA algorithms.

I have two computers, an iMac and a MacBook Pro, and both are running OS X 10.14 (Mojave). I'm trying to use Dragon Dictate Version 5, which has been discontinued (in any Mac version) by Nuance. I installed it and used it successfully some years ago, when the software was current, and when both machines were running previous versions of OS X. I stopped using the software for a while, but I'm returning to it now.\nOn the iMac, Dragon still works fine. On the MacBook, it recognizes text but will not enter it into any application. For example, I can switch between applications by saying \"open Mail\" or saying \"activate Preview\", but within an application I am unable to enter any text.  Things I have tried already:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have made sure that I'm in Dictation Mode, not Command Mode.\n\n*I tried using different microphones.\n\n*I tried creating a new profile.\n\n*I made sure that Dragon has permissions in System Preferences - Security & Privacy – Accessibility to control the computer.\n\n*I tried using Spelling Mode.\n\n\nThis wouldn't be urgent if there were a new version of any sort of dictation software for the Mac available for purchase, but as far as I can see, there isn't.

I was going through yesterday to try to clean up and make the HDD have two partitions -- one FAT and one HTS, while retaining my backups on the HTS. Long story short, for some reason my Windows install would fail to boot after these changes (despite being on a different drive from the Windows and macOS installations).\nI wiped the Windows partition and have been attempting to reinstall via Bootcamp. Unfortunately, my laptop monitor has been broken since I did the first install and I think that may be my problem. I load a bootable USB and partition through Bootcamp Assistant just fine, but upon reboot to do the Windows installation, I get a momentary grey screen followed by a blank screen (monitor turns off from no signal). It does sound as though the machine is working, so my hunch is that the MiniDisplayPort drivers have not loaded but that the Windows installation is present. If it makes a difference, the monitor is running HDMI to a HDMI-to-Minidisplayport adaptor.\nI think that I have ruled out the drive being un-bootable as I just used it to do a fresh macOS install on another machine. Any advice on next steps would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I can not guarantee this is going to work. Good luck!\n\nI assume Windows is detecting your broken display and does not know the display is broken. I assume broken means you can not see anything on the display. I also assume the external display is not mirroring the broken display. If all of this is true, then the problem is: How to get Windows installed to a point where the external monitor can be set as the main display. \n\nThere is an old answer that would require you to install VirtualBox 5.2, which would be compatible with Yosemite.

The following steps would need to be added to the instructions.\n\n\n*\n\n*At step 23, when running the sysprep application, Choose Enter System Audit Mode instead of Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE), as shown below.\n\n\n*At step 25, after Windows starts, execute the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the external monitor, right click and select Screen resolution, as shown below.\n\n\n*If a window similar to the one shown below appears on the external monitor, then skip to the next step. Otherwise, while holding down the  option key, press the space bar. Release both keys. Next, press and release M key, followed by the → cursor key. Finally, wiggle the mouse in the external monitor display, until the window appears. If the windows does not appear, use the cursor keys to move the window to the external monitor.\n\n\n*In the window, click on the second display, then check off the box Make this my main display, as shown below.

Basically, it comes down to the fact that DisplayPort and HDMI are very different signals - most notably, the clock sync signal isn't present.  So, to get a good reliable signal, you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB-C (DisplayPort) to DisplayPort - This is the best option because there's no conversion\n\n*USB-C (DisplayPort) Active HDMI Adapter.

So, I appear to be getting RSI in my left hand due to the frequent pressing of the left-control key. I have already remapped caps-lock to left-control, which did help things for a while.\nI would like to use the keys under the index fingers for control keys, however I cannot seem to get it working properly. It does work, but often when typing quickly, it often registers consecutive key presses as a ctrl+char. I don't think I understand the timing parameters properly, so they might be suboptimal.\nHere is my config:\nOne of my rules:\n{\n  \"description\": \"F is left-control if pressed with other keys\",\n  \"manipulators\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": {\n        \"key_code\": \"f\",\n        \"modifiers\": {\n          \"optional\": [\n            \"any\"\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      \"to\": [\n        {\n          \"key_code\": \"left_control\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"to_if_alone\": [\n        {\n          \"key_code\": \"f\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"basic\"\n    }\n  ]\n},\n\nAnd my timing configuration:\n\"parameters\": {\n  \"basic.simultaneous_threshold_milliseconds\": 50,\n  \"basic.to_delayed_action_delay_milliseconds\": 500,\n  \"basic.to_if_alone_timeout_milliseconds\": 1000,\n  \"basic.to_if_held_down_threshold_milliseconds\": 300,\n  \"mouse_motion_to_scroll.speed\": 100\n},\n\nNB: One additional thing to note is that I actually use a colemak layout so in truth the index fingers are above the T and N keys. I have left that out because I think it may not be relevant (my config above does kind of work), and the question above is probably more relevant to more people.\n\nA: I am also concerned about wrist pain, so I tried the same thing. The closest configuration I got was the following one:\n{\n    \"type\": \"basic\",\n    \"from\": {\n            \"key_code\": \"f\"\n        },\n    \"to_after_key_up\": [\n        {\n            \"key_code\": \"f\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"to_if_held_down\": [\n        {\n            \"key_code\": \"left_control\",\n            \"halt\": true\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nHowever, there is still an additional latency which creates errors when writing fast (for example, when writing \"far\" fast enough, it writes \"afr\").\nTwo possible solutions:\nOption 1: Pressing two simultaneous keys to simulate control key pressing. For example, I use J+K to simulate left_command and J+L to simulate left_control.\nIn the following example, pressing J+L with another_key simulates ctrl + another_key and, if pressed alone, J+L simulates pressing ctrl + X (useful for emacs).\n{\n    \"from\": {\n        \"simultaneous\": [\n            {\n                \"key_code\": \"j\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"key_code\": \"l\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"to\": [\n        {\n            \"key_code\": \"left_control\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"to_if_alone\": [\n        {\n            \"key_code\": \"x\",\n            \"modifiers\": [\n              \"left_control\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    \"type\": \"basic\"\n}\n\nOption 2: Using vim \n", "Q: Mac OS Software for Creating Video Presentations I have a MacBook Pro, and I'm looking for some software which can enable me to create video presentations. This would be similar to a set of slides containing text, images and videos (e.g. made in PowerPoint), but where the video plays the entire presentation (including transitioning between slides, and playing each embedded video within the slides). I have tried a few different software solutions, but each of them has its own flaws:\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft PowerPoint. This is very nice to use and has lots of features, but with the following key flaw: if you are using PowerPoint on Mac OS, and you export the presentation as a video, then any embedded videos will not play and they will just be rendered as images. The videos will only play if you export using Windows. This seems to be a well-known problem that Microsoft are not willing to address.\n\n*Apple Keynote. This solves the above problem by enabling you to export as a video, and the embedded videos will play automatically. However, you have less control than with PowerPoint, particularly when it comes to the videos. For example, you cannot loop a video X times; you can either play it once, or play it forever. Other examples are that you cannot crop videos, and you cannot have complex triggers for the timing of when videos start.\n\n*Apple iMovie. This allows you to have detailed control over the length of individual videos, but it's very limited for making presentations. Most notably for me, you cannot have more than two embedded videos playing at once. And there is significantly less control over text and embedded images than with PowerPoint or Keynote.\n\n*Google Slides. This is fine for very basic presentations, but it is significantly limited when it comes to embedding videos. Furthermore, I don't think there is even an option to export a presentation as a video.\nThere are also \"professional\" level video editing solutions, such as Apple Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere Pro. However, these are firstly very expensive, and secondly far too complex for what I need. All I really need to be able to do is create a simple presentation with embedded videos, and then export this as a single video. I don't need to do complex video editing of the individual videos.\nEffectively, I am looking for functionality at the level of PowerPoint, but with the ability to export to a video whilst working in Mac OS.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: One product that I’ve used with good results is OpenShot Video Editor. It’s open source and cross platform (Mac, Windows, Linux) and best of all free. \nI don’t know about incorporating actual Power Point presentations because the software includes its own mechanisms for transitions, but I was able to include images created (exported) from Power Point into the video. \n", "Q: Open the object location from find I used Spotlight to look for Atari800MacX to upgrade it. It shows me it is located in a folder called Games.\nWell, where is this Games folder? No idea. Spotlighting \"games\" shows other folders called games, but not the one I'm looking for, and I'm not sure where any of these other ones are either.\nRight-click does nothing, you can't select objects in the results (only open them)... is there any way to open the folder or otherwise figure out where the heck it is?\n\nA: Spotlight is good for finding things but for whatever reason lousy at telling you where those things are, as you have discovered.\nBut you can still do a spotlight search in the Finder. Just open a new Finder window and type your search term into the search field in the upper right side of the Finder window.\nOnce you have located the file/folder you want it will show the path to it at the bottom of the Finder window.\nIf you hold the ⌘ Command key down while clicking the mouse on the title bar (where it displays the path again) it will give you a pop-up menu that gives you a graphical hierarchy of exactly where that file/folder is.\n", "Q: \"Whiteboard\" and screen recording apps I work as a teacher (I teach math) and in this situation where schools are closed and are offering distance learning I need to record lectures and share them with my students. Since I need to show how to solve exercises I need some app to use as a whiteboard and an app to record the screen.\nI have a MacBook Air (2019) and a Wacom by One tablet, and at the moment I'm using Microsoft OneNote for Mac as a whiteboard and Screenshot (QuickTime) for screen capture.\nThe problem is that this combo is unbearably slow and laggy: it happens that I have to interrupt the recording every couple of minutes because of that, and sometimes the I lose control of the tablet (it start connecting any point I touch with a straight line).\nI find the two apps I'm using excellent: OneNote has all I need, and with Screenshot/Quicktime handling the videos is immediate and straightforward, but working in this way is a real pain.\nDo you know how can I fix these issues? Or do you have any suggestions for alternative apps?\nUpdate: I also tried ApowerREC for Mac as an alternative to QuickTime, but perhaps it's even worse.\nHere's a gif to show just how sluggish it gets after less than 1 min of recording:\n\nThanks\n\nA: Keynote on your mac is maybe a good way to make a lesson. You can make slides of your lecture and record your voice lectures with it. You can then record the whole slide show as you go through it. It has a great LaTex equation maker with all the symbols you'll need.\nI hope this is what you are looking for.\n", "Q: Auto-launch Microsoft Teams by adding it to my \"Login Items\" I want Microsoft Teams to start automatically every time I turn on/log into my (company) MacBook (running Mojave 10.14.5. \nI can add it to my login-items under System Preferences -> Users & Groups, but the next time I start up it doesn't launch, and when I go back into System Preference, it's no longer listed in my login-items.\nWhat should I try next?\n\nA: First, Enable Autostart in the app itself and then add in login items. \nIn Microsoft Teams > Click on your avatar > Settings > General > tick Auto-start application\nThis will allow you to Auto Launch the MS team from Login items. \n", "Q: Guest account only cannot access admin Running Mavericks 10.9.5, iMac 12,1 21.5 Intel i5 2.7ghz 16gb.\nI want to re-image the machine but it only boots with a Guest account.

Are the new 18W power adapters for the iPhone 11's compatible with the MacBook Pro 13-inch (2019)?\nIs it safe? Anything to watch out for?\n\nWhat about using my MacBook's adapter (with the correct cable) on my iPhone 11 Pro? Is that safe\n\nA: Yes, it is safe to connect the 18W USB-C power adapter to a MacBook Pro. However, I wouldn't expect it to actually be useful for charging the laptop. The charger supports 5V (max 15W) and 9V (max 18W), but with the MacBook Pro you really want a 15V or 20V charger to be able to get some energy transferred in a timely manner.\nAnd yes, it is also safe to use the MacBook Pro's USB-C charger with the iPhone 11 Pro using the correct cable. It should be able to charge your phone just fine.\n", "Q: Your computer is disabled. Try again in 60 minutes. Firmware password I need to factory reset a 2019 Mac Mini with the T2 chip.

We've lost this password - this is the reason for the boot loop. \nAnyway around the firmware password?\n\nA: You can contact Apple Support with the problem. If you have the receipts for the Mac Mini, they should be able to help you getting the firmware password cleared.\nDepending on how the hardware was purchased, you might need to ship it in for a paid repair or arrange in person repair, but the online support from Apple Service can assist with your country specifics.\n\n*\n\n*https://locate.apple.com\n", "Q: How can I find an app on my iPhone? I have not found a way to locate the placement of an app in my many pages of folders on my iPhone home screen, short of looking through every single folder on every single page.\nBefore you say \"use the search feature\" let me point out \"search\" does not actually allow you to find anything—or, if it does, it's very hard to figure out how.  The so-called search feature gives you an alternate launcher, but if it can be used to tell you where your app icon is in the many pages of your home screen, buried in the many folders on each page, I have not figured out how to make it do that.  If all you want to do is launch the app, then \"search\" is okay.  But if you want to move it to a certain folder, then (as far as I can tell) you're out of luck.\nAt least as of March 2020, when I'm writing this.  Apple has finally given us the ability to delete things from the App Store, so they're on the right track.  But I am failing to find a way to find things.  Is there a way to do it?\nUpdate:\nSee my answer below to connect the dots between the problem and jmh's solution.\n\nA: If you have Open_Term or another app that you can use the command line on, go to that app and cd into your directory. Then type ls -laRt. That will list all the contents of all the folders. You can then search the output for the app you want.\nIt's a lot to do for what you want. There should be an easy and automatic way to do this.\nYou can also use the spotlight search which should give you the folder the app is in. From your home screen slide the desktop to the right to get the window where the widgets are are accessible. At the top of that window is a search bar. This is the spotlight search. Type the complete name of the app in the search box and hit return. If there is only one match it will list the folder where the app is stored.\n\nA: The solution is sort of implicit in @jmh's answer, so I'll write it out explicitly here.  (But please give credit to him.)\nThe subtly hidden problem is that the search field gives results before you hit the \"search\" button, and so I never bother hitting that button after typing in my search.  Why press \"Search\" if I already have results?  I'm not sure if I ever noticed that it exists...\nIt turns out that you get results formatted differently if you take that last additional step of pressing the button.  Included in these \"post-button\" results is the name of the folder where the application is stored.  You don't get the number of the page, but the folder name is a good start. \n", "Q: How can I know if my macbook is hacked? Today when I turned on my macbook I could see that the Desktop Background has been changed to Yosemite picture.\nThen right after clicking on Change Desktop background... the background changed to the one I had, which was a green background with a dog in the center, except for the dog picture, it was only the green background.\nAfter this I clicked again on Change Desktop background... and it changed again to the Yosemite picture.\nFinally I went to finder file to see where the picture of the dog was, and when I clicked to see it, it was opened but at the same time 2 more pictures were opened.\nAfter all this, I clicked again on Change Desktop background... but nothing happened. The Yosemite background didn't change this time.\nAll the time when this happened, my mac didn't have connection to internet.\nWhy? Is my mac hacked? Does it have a virus? What do I do?\nNotes.\n\n*\n\n*Every once in a while I see a message on the upper RHS (in the corner of the screen) telling me that I should update something related to the system but I always click on later and then the message vanishes.\n\nUpdate\nMore details of the situation above.\n3 pictures were opened by itself at the same time. I did not chose to open 2 of them, had I chose them then they weren't be displayed in the way they did because there is a standard way when one open several pictures at once. There 3 pictures displayed like  if I were selected 1, then the other and then the other within milliseconds.\nThat above plus the change of desktop background, it's 10000% strange.\nI know that is stupid to think that I am hacked but have I another option than to this so?\nSo, how can I know if someone,  from another part in the world, is in my macbook?\nFootnote. Related question of mine Why did my desktop background changed and why pictures were opened, if I did nothing to do so?\n\nA: No.  You are not hacked.\nHackers do not operate in this manner.  There's this common misconception about hackers being in the dark recesses of their parents basement consuming copious amounts of Red Bull and Hot Pockets in an effort to brute force their way into your computer to change the background picture.\nHacking is 90% social engineering - it's exploiting vulnerabilities to get you to \"give up the goods\" like passwords, security questions, or any other sort of credential to gain access to a system.\nSo, what do they do when they gain access?\nTry to find more credentials to gain access to other systems. Maybe they get a treasure trove of identity \"stuff\" (drivers license info, credit card or banking info, etc.) that they can sell online, but what they're looking for is more keys to get into other systems.  It's about a lateral move to the next system(s), not breaking the one they're currently on.\nChanging your desktop picture and drawing attention to their activities would be a colossal waste of time because if you know they're there, you're going to cut them off (i.e. wipe the drive and reinstall the OS and/or change passwords, etc.).  If they were going to do something that called your attention to them, it would be to hold your computer/information for ransom; in other words install ransomware.\nIs it a Virus?\nUnlikely. Again, this would be a waste of time for a virus writer to infect your computer to change your background.  And technically, it would be called malware because a virus is a type of malware that self-propagates much like the flu.  Those are few and far between now and most malware is self inflicted (by downloading/installing software of questionable origin).\nWhat do you do?\nIf you're concerned someone has access to your computer - change your passwords. Change the passwords on all of the accounts on your Mac.  If you've got three, change all three.  Change your iCloud password.  Change whatever account password you feel may have been compromised.\nNow, if you Netflix account uses the same password as your Apple login, well, shame!  Get a password manager and start using it put different passwords on every online account.\n\n*\n\n*Keeper Security (Free for single device, $30/yr for unlimited device and passwords)\n\n*Dashlane - (Free for 1 device and 50 accounts, $60/yr for unlimited devices and passwords)\n\n*1Password - (Free trial, $36/yr for unlimited passwords, items and 1GB secure document storage)\n\n*KeePass (Cross platform and free but requires a bit of tech savvy to sync across all devices)\n\n*McAfee TrueKey (Free for 15 passwords/unlimited devices; $20/yr unlimited passwords/devices\n\nStill not certain you have malware installed?\nInstall security software like Malwarebytes, Webroot, or McAfee Security\nHowever, if you do have an infected computer, I've always subscribed to the \"nuke it\" and reinstall philosophy.  This is where having a backup really comes in handy.\nWhat about my changing background and open pictures?\nCheck your desktop settings - see if set to rotate (change every so often).  Change it to something else or turn it off altogether.  Then come back and reset it to what you want.  As for your open pictures, you may have inadvertently opened two pictures at once.  It's happened to me while using the trackpad; it’s happened to all of us at one time or another.\nKeep your software updated\n\nEvery once in a while I see a message on the upper LHS telling me that\nI should update something related to the system but I always click on\nlater and then the message vanishes.\n\nIf it's the left of the screen, it's not coming from the Notification Center.  Track down what it is and either uninstall the software (if not using) or update it.   Know the software you've got installed.\nIf it’s showing up on the right side of your screen, per your edit, check your notifications!  This is like taking your temperature, ignoring the reading and then jumping to the conclusion that you’ve got Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (it presents with a fever).  The point is, read and respond to the notification, that’s why Apple implemented it.\nProbably the most controversial thing I'm going to advise here is that you should stop (if you're doing it of course) looking for and putting a priority on free software over known titles/developers.  Nothing's free.  It's much better to install an app that costs 5 dollars/euros/pounds/seashells from a developer that registers with Apple than finding a free app that requires you to bypass Gatekeeper to install.\nIT is my profession for over 30 years now and even though I posses the skills to overcome malware, I will opt for the paid version over the free one 99% of the time.\nBottom Line...\nIf you skipped over everything above and take only one thing away from this it should be to have a backup.  Catastrophic things are going to happen - I guarantee it.\nEven if you actually get hacked and your data is being held for ransom you can recover everything simply by wiping your computer, reinstalling, and restoring your data.\nA Time Machine backup is the cheapest insurance policy you can buy.\n", "Q: I dropped my iPhone Xs into a hot dishwasher, will that damage the data on the iPhone? I dropped my iPhone Xs into a hot, steaming dishwasher, and it seems to be working fine. However, the photos on it are very grainy and pixelated. Could hot steam damage the data on an iPhone X?\n\nA: No.  It doesn't damage the data, per se.\nHeat, steam, and water may damage the physical phone, but it won't go in and start corrupting data.  The ones and zeros stored on the chip(s) aren't perishable.  When data gets corrupted, the whole file gets \"damaged\" to the point of being unusable; it won't lower the resolution to the point of being grainy.  This is not a photo on paper. \nHowever, if you damage the phone in such a way that the phone is inoperable or the storage is damaged then the data becomes inaccessible.  If you sync your data to the cloud (iCloud, OneDrive, etc.) then your data remains accessible.\nIf/when you go to the Apple store for service, they will first check to see when your last backup was; even if you have iCloud.  If you don't, you'll be read the riot act and given a disclaimer and acknowledgement that they're not responsible for data loss.\nThis is why backups are so important. \nWhile data can be sync'd to the cloud, it should not be considered backup.  Changes you make on one device get sent to the cloud storage and every other connected device.  A quick trip through the dishwasher won't change your data but if it hasn't sync'd or it wasn't set up, you could lose your data.\nGrainy Photos\nThis is likey from your LCD being damaged.  If you want to confirm this, open the same photo on your computer or send it to a friend.  If it's clear there, your phone is damaged.\n", "Q: MacBook Internal SSD Not showing up in System Information or Disk Utility A couple days ago my MacBook, an early 2016, 12-inch, Retina model had a hard freeze, rainbow wheel and screen frozen.\nAfter a forced restart holding down the power button I was able to get to the login screen but my password would not work. \nAfter additional restarts I was greeted with the Flashing ?

I noticed that my iPhone 11 Pro wasn’t making any sounds anymore. So I looked into my Bluetooth setting and saw that it was connected to a strange illegible device. It had no (i) icon next to it, so there was no way to forget the device or disconnect from it. The only way for me to get sound back was to completely shut off Bluetooth. If I legitimately wanted to auto connect to those other legible devices, then how should I ban this mystery device?\n\n\nA: The obvious cause is an app you installed placed the connection. Garmin’s companion app for a dashboard camera is reported to do this.\nOnce you’ve deleted these apps or eliminated the chance it’s an app, the next possibility is a corruption of the database where connections are stored.\nBefore doing that you might want to sign out of iCloud and restart the device since iCloud sync does also bring a pairing in from another device.\nIn some cases a three step process let’s me delete “phantom” destinations reliably when the tap to remove doesn’t work.\n\n*\n\n*Play video with sound or music and select one of the the headset / speaker options\n\n*Then Restart the phone\n\n*Finally, put the phone in Airplane mode and turn off bluetooth and WiFi entirely, shut down the device and then restart and repeat the remove process below\n\n\nProper functioning device let you remove the pairing as you ask. Hopefully you can restore things without a backup / erase / restore.\nOnce that’s set, you of course would do the normal action of:\n\n*\n\n*Tap the letter i in blue with the circle\n\n*forget this device.\n\nIf there is still no I with a blue circle - you may have a managed device or need to remove the management profile (settings app) or erase the device or reset settings, but your screen shot shows you should be able to just unpair the listed devices. If tapping the i icon doesn't work, your device is malfunctioning and you need to restart it, reset it, erase it or seek service from Apple / other troubleshooting resources.\n\n*\n\n*No option to remove Bluetooth device in iOS Settings app?\n\nA: Another answer that bmike linked seems to have some great ideas: No option to remove Bluetooth device in iOS Settings app\nHere were the main suggestions:\n1) Check for any profiles that might be installed on your phone -- go to Settings--> General--> Profiles. Remove any you don't know and if you can't remove one it may be related to a managed product like a workplace device.\n2) Check for applications that may use sound -- someone mentioned Bose has the ability to add a device to there. Then you would delete the application and it would remove the device from the list. Think about any audio programs you might have installed, for example if there's one for a smart speaker or something for a car.\n3) Consider erasing and restoring your iPhone or at least choosing General--> Reset Network Settings. Always the last option you want to do.. but if you're really stuck and can't find a solution it may be worth the trouble.\n\nA: Mines my Tesla appvery similar name starts with S2…..random letters & numbers, only shows when app is open in background. My phone seems to pickup within 30 yards of the car indoors or outside doesn’t seem to affect its range. I reckon quit some open apps and that might link with a device.\nSetting >general >nobackground app refresh might have something open that’s not showing in app switching.\n", "Q: Mojave on Parallels I have a Macbook running macOS Sierra(10.12) - I cant upgrade to 10.14 as my business applications wont work on it.\nBut that means i cant also install Xcode. Is there a way install 10.14 in Parallels without upgrading my macbook? Parallels shows an option to create the virtual machine using 10.12 but how do I give it the file to install 10.14?\n\nA: Yes, there is a way to run older and newer releases of MacOS in a VM using parallels. The parallels blog has some walkthroughs on how to do this, but they're quite complicated and didn't work for my use case (trying to run an older MacOS version in a VM)\nIf you're familiar with programming, an easier way is using gibMacOS to download the exact version of MacOS that you want to run in a VM, turn it into an installable package, and then use the \"Install Windows or other OS from DVD or image file\" option in parallels to install that.\nIf you're not a developer, here are the steps to use gibMacOS:\n\n*\n\n*Download the project zip file and unzip it\n\n*Run the gibMacOS.command script. You will see a menu with the available OS releases. Pick the one you want to run in the VM. Wait for it to download.\n\n*When it is finished downloading, it will tell you where the result was saved.\n\n*Run the BuildMacOSinstallapp.command​ script\n\n*Drag & drop the InstallESDDmg.pkg file downloaded in step 3 to the terminal window. It will create a MacOs .app up to about 10 Gb in size\n\n*Use parallels \"Install Windows or other OS from DVD or image file\" to install this .app in a VM\n\n", "Q: How can I track down the process that started a VPN interface on Catalina?

when laptop lid is closed I am having the most frustrating problem. I have a 2019 Macbook Pro (AMD 5500M) running Windows 10 / Bootcamp. I have a 4k UHD external display which will not display above 30hz. I thought it could be the cable, but somehow discovered that when the laptop lid is open, both displays will run at 60hz! \nI close the lid, and the display switches back down to 29hz. There is no way to change this. \nThis problem ONLY occurs in Windows 10 / Bootcamp. This does not happen on Mac. \nHere are the screenshots for the monitor settings\nhttps://imgur.com/a/QyOVoRS\n\nOther things I have tried\nJust disabling the monitor in the display settings (use only thing monitor).

The current download does not appear to work properly. This software is for the UEFI booting of Windows. This method of booting was adopted by the industry for booting x64 Windows in 2011. Apple started using this method of booting x64 Windows in 2012. Prior to UEFI booting, the industry (including Apple) used the BIOS boot method for x64 Windows. The BIOS boot method dates back to mid 1980's, when the original IBM PC's BIOS was modified to allow booting from internal HDD and has gone through many revisions since then.\nThe BIOS boot files for your Mac are suppose to be used for the installation of BIOS booting x64 Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), 8 or 8.1. However, these files should also work with x64 Windows 10. In your case, you would need to download Boot Camp Version 5.1 (Build 5640). These files have been referred to as the Boot Camp Support Software or the Windows Support Software.\nCreate a Partition for Windows.\nAssuming you have a single internal drive with an EFI partition as disk0s1 and an Apple_APFS container partition as disk0s2, the you can enter the following command to create a ExFAT formatted partition where ultimately Windows will be installed. Here, you will need to replace 800G with the size of you wish to shrink the Apple_APFS container partition to make room for Windows.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 800G ExFAT BOOTCAMP 0\n\nFor example, say the command diskutil list disk0 shows the following before entering the above command.\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         999.8 GB   disk0s2\n\nThe result after entering the command is shown below.\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         800.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                199.8 GB   disk0s3\n\nOne problem, with manually installing a BIOS booting Windows, is the need for the drive to be hybrid partitioned. The Disk Utility used to hybrid partition drives, but this no longer happens with High Sierra and newer versions of macOS. Basically, there are two types of partition tables stored in a Mac. The first is the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. Normally, this contains a single entry of type 0xEE which indicates the existence of the second type called the GUID Partition Table (GPT). The partition entries in this table are used by macOS and UEFI booting Windows. However, BIOS booting Windows only read values from the MBR partition table. Therefore, in order to get BIOS booting Windows to work, the entries the GPT need to be copied to the MBR partition table. Once this is correctly accomplished, the Mac is said to be hybrid partitioned. Two different methods to hybrid partition a drive are given here. If method 1 was applied to the above example, then the input to gdisk would be as follows.\nr\nh\n2 3\ny\naf\nn\n07\ny\nn\nw\ny\n\nExample output is shown below.\ndavidanderson@Snapper ~ % sudo gdisk /dev/disk0\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.4\n\nWarning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their\npartition table automatically reloaded!\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.\n\nCommand (? for help): r\n\nRecovery/transformation command (? for help): h\n\nWARNING!

Use the ExFAT format with a MBR partition type. Mount the Windows ISO and copy all the files to the flash drive. Do the same with the Boot Camp Support Software. If you are using the Windows 10 (1909), the the result should be the same as shown below.\n\nNext, you need to write boot code to the MBR and boot sectors of the ExFAT formatted partition. On my Mac, I have VirtualBox installed. So, I basically create a Windows 10 virtual machine using the default settings. Next I put the Windows 10 ISO in the virtual DVD drive and the physical flash drive in the virtual machines USB port. Next, I booted from the virtual DVD drive and pressed the shift+F10 key combination when the first window appeared. The opens a Command Prompt window where the following command can be entered.\nboosect /nt60 c: /mbr\n\nBelow is an image showing that the boot sectors were updated.\n\nTo shutdown the virtual machine, follow the steps below.\n\nEnter command exit to close the Command Prompt window.\n  Click on Repair your computer.\n  Click on Turn off your PC.\n\nFinally, you need to mark the first (only) partition on the drive as active. Here I assume the flash drive have been assigned the identifier disk2. To flag the partition as active, enter the following commands.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk2\nsudo fdisk -e /dev/disk2\nflag 1\nquit\n\nBelow is an example.\ndavidanderson@Snapper ~ % diskutil unmountdisk disk2\nUnmount of all volumes on disk2 was successful\ndavidanderson@Snapper ~ % sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk2  \nPassword:\nfdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\nEnter 'help' for information\nfdisk: 1> flag 1\nPartition 1 marked active.\nfdisk:*1> quit\nWriting current MBR to disk.\n\nInstall Windows\nRestart the Mac and immediately hold down the option key until the Startup Manager icons appear. Next, choose the external drive icon labeled Windows.\n\nNote: If the Mac reboots back to macOS before finishing installing Windows, select Windows from the Startup Disk pane of System Preferences. Next, click on the Restart button. Windows will continue installing.\n\nIf you have problems installing the Windows Support Software after installing Windows, then try entering the command BootCamp.msi in an Administrator Command Prompt window. The BootCamp.msi file can be found in the BootCamp\\Drivers\\Apple folder on the flash drive. You will need to change to this folder before entering the BootCamp.msi command.\n", "Q: Use Automator to run Python script when files added to folder I have a folder, Books, where I add all of the .pdf files that need to be uploaded to a Kindle. I have a Python script that does that, but instead of manually running it, I want to check whenever files are added to Books, run that Python script. Is there any way to do this using Automator, or even without Automator?\n\nA: Launch Automator, and choose 'Folder Action' as the document type. \nThen set the target folder in the drop-down menu at the top of the window. \nAdd a \"Run Shell Script\" action. You have to choose one of the 'shell' environments in the drop-down menu, which include either the system python /usr/bin/python (which is v2, and EOLed); or a Unix shell, where you can call the python script externally, with something like:\n/usr/local/bin/python3 <path to python script> \"$1\"\n\nAlternatively to using the Run Shell Script action, you could use the AppleScript action with a do shell script command.\nSave your workflow. The workflow is saved to ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts\nYou can configure Folder Actions for any folder by right-clicking in the Finder and selecting \"Folder Actions Setup\".\n(I have had intermittent success hacking the saved workflow in a text editor, and altering the 'shell' path to another environment. /usr/bin/swift works, but /usr/local/bin/python doesn't. More work required.)\n", "Q: How to restore wrongly edited + wrongly saved TextEdit file?

Reopen the document in TextEdit, then from the File menu choose Revert To. It'll have a submenu that might have a relevant snapshot listed that you can choose directly. If not, choose Browse All Versions. You'll get a Time-Machine-like history on the right side of the screen, and you can look for the latest good version, then when you find what you want click Restore.\nSee this OWC/MacSales article, this one at OS X Daily, and this Apple support guide for more details and options.\n", "Q: NFS server support in OS X 10.15.x Catalina?

Depending on what NFS features you are planning to use, we strongly recommend to stay away from Catalina.\n\nSo far, I read this thread:\nThread on NFS Support in Catalina\nthat NFS v2,v3 is supported as a server and NFS v2,v3,v4 is supported as a client.  I'm curious if there was better support pre-Catalina and if something changed in Catalina.\nI'm interested in serving a home directory to a VirtualBox instance of Debian Linux.

Is there any more debug I can do?\nThanks\n\nA: Do you have the NFS client utilities installed on the Linux system? The error message from your Linux system states that /sbin/mount.nfs isn't present, which suggests that the NFS client utilities are missing.

It's up to date and I have freed up more disk space. \nAnyway, my issue is weird and I haven't been able to fix it nor find anyone who's had it. Basically, sometimes, whenever I perform any one of a set of actions, the application will freeze, ill get the spinning wheel, and the application does not respond (\"Application is not responding\"), I try force-quitting and that fixes the freeze, but then it will happen again if I do the action again. I have noticed the issue on XD, Chrome, Safari and Finder. \nSo, the actions are for example: cmd+c on Chrome, cmd+r on Chrome, trying to select a image from finder in Chrome, trying to edit text or cmd+c on XD, trying to delete or move a file to another folder on Finder, highlighting text on System Information, trying to open a link in new tab on Safari. \nAnd when there is an issue with one of them, (e.g. try to copy on chrome and chrome freezes), then if I go onto XD and try to edit text I will also get the freeze. However, weirdly, some actions like cmd+c dont cause issue on Slack, however attaching/selecting a file from \"Your computer\" (through Finder) does cause the Not responding issue. And so, what's weird is that then I have to try and restart and force-quit all applications, and re-launch Finder etc., it is an arduous task to try and fix it. But when it is fixed then all applications will work, until randomly it starts freezing each application when doing those actions I mentioned before. \nNote that the issue may also happen on other applications and with other actions, but those are the only ones I've noticed so far.\nThis issue is extremely annoying, and has been frustrating me for months now, with no fix yet! Lately, it's been happening more frequently and is harder to fix (as in I have to do many restarts, many shut downs, sometimes SMC resets etc. to make the issue go away)\nPLEASE HELP!\n\nA: Turns out it was an issue in the MacOS software.

So I picked up the Duet Displays app that allows you to extend your PC / MAC to another device over Wifi. This meant I could use my S10 as a second screen. \nNext step was to connect the phone to the monitor and mirror the display.\nThat sort of works.\nA slightly better option was that because it's a Samsung phone that means it has the DeX OS installed, and you can run the Duet Displays app within DeX. That gives me full-screen access on my monitor (albeit at not an ideal resolution, and sometimes lag too as it's over Wifi).\nIf you have an iPhone then I suppose Sidecar could also do the same configuration.\nSo there you go.

But in the morning after its been asleep all night this never works! The fans don't start to spin -- it just stays silent. The only way to wake up the computer is to physically open and shut the macbook's lid briefly. How do I fix this? So far I've had this setup for ~2 weeks, and I have never had trouble waking up during the day, and 100% of the time have had trouble in the morning after. How do I fix this?\nAdditional info/stuff I've tried:\nIn the Energy Saver system preferences pane, I have the following set (for \"Power Adapter\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*Unchecked: Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\n\n*Checked: Put hard disks to sleep when possible\n\n*Checked: Wake for Wi-Fi network access\n\n*Checked: Enable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter\n\n\nI also have automatic graphics switching enabled.\nShould I change any of those settings?\nI looked at this question, and tried things like clearing system caches, resetting the NVRAM and the SMC, and resetting display settings. I don't have the option of swapping ports. I have not disabled automatic GPU switching, as I am worried that that will wear out my mac faster. I also would really rather not attach my keyboard to the one free bluetooth wake is enabled, although I don't use any bluetooth devices, so I doubt that's important.\nI know that I could simply prevent my macbook from ever going to sleep, but that seems like a really bad idea from a longevity standpoint, right? Any suggestions would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Per our conversation in comments, the problem seems to be that your computer is going into hibernation (aka Safe Sleep) overnight, and that hibernation is interfering with waking the machine up while it's in clamshell mode. It's possible that the machine would eventually wake up, even in clamshell — waking up from hibernation can take significantly longer than waking up from sleep, and I don't know whether you've tested for that — but in any case, hibernation is a setting that can be adjusted or turned off.\nWhen the computer goes into hibernation, it writes the entire contents of RAM to disk and then turns off power to the RAM chips, sending the machine into a low power-use state. When the machine wakes up, the RAM is turned back on and the hibernation file is read back into it, effectively returning the machine to the exact state it was in before hibernation. This was originally intended for Mac portables with swappable batteries to prevent data loss. In other words, if you were (say) on a plane doing spreadsheets or watching a movie (or whatever) and ran out of battery power, the machine would shut itself off, you could swap in a fresh battery, and the machine would restart exactly where you left off. You could also set the machine to only use hibernate mode, giving a bit extra battery life by bypassing sleep mode (which wastes power keeping RAM active while your machine is asleep). That effectively trades slower wake-ups and power-downs for better batter life. In modern machines with fixed batteries, hibernate acts as a failsafe: e.g., if the power goes out and your battery runs down, hibernate will ensure that you don't lose whatever you were working on. \nTurning hibernate off mostly means you need to take responsibility for ensuring your work is saved. It has no effect aside from saving power and preventing data loss.\nYou control the hibernate function through the unix pmset (power management settings) utility. See: man pmset. To turn hibernate mode off completely when the machine is in charging mode (i.e., connected to a power cord), open Terminal and run the following command:\nsudo pmset -c hibernatemode 0\n\nThis will turn off hibernate mode when your machine is plugged in, but keep it active when your computer is running on battery power. If you prefer to turn it off entirely in all modes, omit the -c option. \nThe hibernatemode setting takes three values:\n\n\n*\n\n*hibernatemode 0: turns off hibernate for the specified power configuration\n\n*hibernatemode 3: turns on hibernate for the specified power configuration\n\n*hibernatemode 25: turns on hibernate for the specified power configuration, and sets it as the default mode, bypassing normal sleep.\n\n\nIt is also possible to change the way hibernate operates using the pmset settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*standby (0/1): 'standby' tells the machine to hibernate after a set\ntime in sleep, saving power.\n\n*standbydelayhigh, standbydelaylow, highstandbythreshold: the first two specify a time in seconds for when to send the machine into hibernation; the last specifies a batter percentage. The threshold is usually set at 50 (half power), and longer hibernate delays are set when the battery has more power\n\n*autopoweroff, autopoweroffdelay: European-complaince equivalents ofstandby and the two 'standbydelay' settings.\n\n\nYou could monkey with those to fine-tune the machine's behavior, if you're so inclined.\n", "Q: Upgrade Mac OS from El Capitan to Sierra How can I find the build date of a serial number like W89072N87WY to check if an upgrade from El Capitan 10.11.6 is possible. \nWhat’s the process to check for Sierra?\n\nA: Apple has machine friendly names for Sierra  here. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208202\nSince you didn’t show that, use Everymac's Ultimate Mac Lookup\nThis is a MacBook \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.0 13\" (Unibody), maximum macOS 10.11.x - so, no, it's been upgraded as far as it will go.\n", "Q: Is there a terminal app that can record commands?

Is there anyway to generate a password and store it manually in Keychain?\nI need keychain to remember it, as there's no way I'll remember QW45FX-ASDASD style passwords, and MS won't let me re-use all my memorable phrases, as they've been passwords previously.\n\nA: For apps like that, not only will it not offer a suggestion, it probably won't remember whatever you put in it manually.\nFor things like this, I either try to use their web-page equivalent, which at least will get it into Keychain so I can look it up manually next time, or if there is no web option, you can make keychain generate passwords manually, though you still have to do this manual search for it each time, then copy/paste to the app…\nFrom Keychain Access, + button or  Cmd ⌘   N \nGive it a memorable name, account name & then click the key button lower right.\nYou can choose length & password type.\n\nOnce completed click Add.\nAlternatively, if you also have an iOS device with the same app & password if you fill it in there manually, then Keychain will remember it, but only auto-fill it for iOS, not for the Mac app.\nFile this under irritating. ;)\nLate thought - watch out if you get iOS to add it to keychain after doing this manually from macOS, because you will likely end up with two independent entries.\n", "Q: How can I free disk space on the device to get it back into communication?

You can download them again for free. Also, delete the  Applications you don't need.  If you go to Settings/General there is an option that reads iPhone Storage. Open that and give it time to completely load. At the bottom, it will give you a listing of all your applications and the size of them. Check and see if you can delete any of the large ones.\n\nA: The iPhone is back to accessible.\nI had to reboot the device. After an endless time of waiting for the UI to come up again, the device came back.\nIt showed an non genuine battery warning. Reboot again.\nThe iPhone seems back to normal, but it is not recognized when connected to the mac. Reboot again.\nThe device is now properly recognized and all the deleted apps are now synced into iTunes. A warning pops up, that Music is missing (correct, I deleted it).\nSome images are not recognized by Photo app to be not yet imported. I need to move them in a new album, then they are synced. \nStill three movies left on the device, Photos app on mac shows error on import. \n2 of them can be copied as file over iCloud. Third persists to leave the device.

About the same? Better? Worse?\nThanks for any pointer in the right direction ✌️\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro has a dual core i5-4258U CPU, which currently has average scores of 645/1,401 (single-core/multi-core) in Geekbench 5. There aren't yet enough scores of the latest (early 2020) MacBook Air but one early benchmark returned scores of 1,047/2,658.\nThis suggests that the MacBook Air should be almost twice as fast as your current MacBook Pro, which seems reasonable as the former has a seven generations-later quad core CPU. One thing to be aware of - due to the size of the MacBook Air it may not be able to sustain that level of performance for extended periods as the CPU may be throttled so that it doesn't exceed temperature thresholds. A MacBook Pro won't throttle the CPU as much as the chassis is slightly larger and it has improved cooling (even with any possible throttling the Air will be faster than your current MacBook Pro).\n\nA: No way the new Air won’t run literal circles around anything from 2013. \n\n\n*\n\n*ridiculously faster NVMe storage\n\n*Many generations better CPU never mind the I or GHz\n\n\nMaybe spend up from the $999 model if you want a CPU for 3 years, but the entry Air is a powerhouse compared to most 2015 Macs. \n", "Q: 24\" Intel iMac (2006) date and time keeps resetting on boot, even after new battery and NVRAM reset Since a week my iMac, running Snow Leopard, behaves strangely in two ways:\nFirst, I always unplug the iMac when I don't use it. Now, when I plug it in, it immediately starts, without me pressing the On-button.\nSecond, after booting, the date and time are 1st of January, 2001, midnight. Several programs complain instantly. The IP address is something strange, certainly not the usual 192.168.X.Y address. As internet access, I use a network cable connected to a Devolo home-plug (connected to a fibre glass modem).\nAfter two minutes of waiting, the iMac gets a normal IP address. One minute later, the date and time are what they should be.\nFirst, when I googled the symptoms, the cause seemed easy: just replace the internal CR2032 battery. After all, it's 14 years old. I did that and it didn't help. It did change the volume of the startup chime though, it's much louder now.\nThen I reset the NVRAM/PRAM, with the four button thing when booting. That helped for one boot, but on the second boot, 1st of January 2001.\nI booted in Safe mode. Several times resetting NVRAM/PRAM. I checked the system settings, but they are what they have been the last 10 years.\nUnfortunately, nothing seems to work. Is there anything else wrong with the machine? Is there some other battery that needs to be replaced?\nSometimes I booted the iMac without the Devolo, and used WiFi. Even when it did not have an internet connection, the time was always what it should be. So the strange IP address should not be the cause of the iMac not knowing the right date/time.\n\nA: Because I had 1% uncertainty about how I had placed the new battery in its holder and because I wanted to make sure it was firmly in place, I reopened the iMac. And what did I behold? The battery holder is supposed to be connected to the motherboard on two places, the upper and bottom side. And the upper side was loose! This must have happened while prying out the old battery, that is an even trickier operation than I thought it was.\nSo that was the cause. Now I have the challenge of fixing this. Duct tape (to hold the battery holder down on the board) didn't help, I can tell you that by now. It should be soldered, but I have neither the equipment nor the skill to do that :-(\n", "Q: Running Apple Arcade Alongside Other Applications I cannot seem to work in other applications when Apple Arcade is running. I run Apple Arcade on a secondary screen to keep the kids busy and want to continue working on my primary MBP screen. However, focusing any other application pauses Apple Arcade.\nHow can I run Apple Arcade alongside other applications?\n\nA: This is a basic premise of computing.\nOnly one application can be frontmost at any given time. That is the one that will accept input from any connected devices, mouse, keyboard etc.\nThere is some leeway for such as the scroll-wheel, which can scroll any window the cursor is over, whether foremost or not, but that is an exception rather than a rule.\nAlso, such as a video or audio stream will continue to run, so you can watch YouTube or listen to the radio in the background\nGames tend to alleviate the control issue by pausing when backgrounded - it saves your poor avatar from being squished/killed/juiced etc whilst you're not actually controlling it.\nThere is no way round this.\n", "Q: MacOS Mojave doesn't give IP for Internet Sharing I'm trying to share the internet connection from a MBP with an Android phone or Windows laptop.\nRight now, the MBP gets internet from another Android phone (USB tethering + HoRNDIS) and I want to share it over wifi.

Disk Mode.... bricked my mac? Ok so I may have bricked one of my MacBook Airs.\nI am writing this post from the MB that's working. I have another one with a dead display. I connected them by Thunderbolt and mounted the broken one as a disk onto the working one using Target Disk mode. Then I used the disk utility to reformat the drive as APFS, Guid Partition. Then I tried to install Catalina but it says \"You may not install to this volume because it's a Mac in target disk mode\" (see screenshot.)\nHave I created an irrecoverable situation?\nThe only solution I can imagine is to remove the HDD from the bum Mac, put it into the working Mac, install Catalina that way, then put the drive back. Both Macs are out of warranty so it's whatever... but I'm wondering there's a less messy way to get myself out of this hairy situation?\n\nA: What many people fail to take into account when they install a new version of macOS on a Mac, is that the process does not simply involve copying files to the Mac's internal hard drive, but also a firmware upgrade to make the firmware/EFI support booting from the new OS. This is why you get the message you get: if you boot a Mac in target mode and attempt to install a new version of macOS onto it, the Mac you install into would not boot (if you had managed), because it would never have had the firmware necessary to boot installed. \nFor instance, when installing High Sierra on a Mac, the firmware necessary for the boot loader to recognise and boot from an APFS volume and disk structure must be installed, since HS was the first version of macOS to be able to boot from an AFPS volume. Similarly, when installing Catalina, the firmware necessary for the boot loader to parse the new two-volume read-only / read-write setup must be installed on the Mac that will boot the installed OS\nSo in short, the only viable way to be able to install (some versions of) macOS on a Mac, is to actually boot that Mac one way or another and install the version of macOS from the it, from the Mac that will run what you install.\nIn your case, if the only problem is a broken display, a viable solution is to boot the Mac with an external keyboard, mouse and display plugged in, while connected to a power adapter, since that should put the Mac in clamshell mode and fully operational. If you have already wiped the internal disk, put the working Mac into target mode and boot the broken Mac from the OS installed on the working Mac, plugged in via thunderbolt or Firwire (depending on connectivity options).\n", "Q: Macbook 16\" won't extend desktop with Display Port Chaining I have a new Macbook 16\" running 10.15.3 OSx with an AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 4 GB for the graphics card and I'm unable to get the desktop to extend using just Display Port chaining. \nThe monitors I'm trying to chain together are a Dell P2719HC 27-inch (1920 x 1080) and a Dell U2415 24-inch (1920 x 1200).

It seems like the USB-C ports on the new MacBooks are not true Display Port 1.2+ compatible and requires individual connections to each external monitor that you want to extend your desktop to.  What gives apple?\n\nA: macOS does not support MST (Multi-Stream Transport) daisy chaining, so you cannot get such a setup working with extended desktop at all. You can get mirrored displays working (i.e. both monitors display the same picture), but this is obviously not what you want. \nYou can get extended desktop working in a MST daisy-chained setup as you have by running Windows or Linux on the MacBook Pro.\nAs you have figured out yourself, you could connect both displays with extended desktop by using two separate cables that both plugin to the MacBook Pro.\nIf you want to use a single cable to connect multiple monitors in extended desktop on macOS, you'll need to use either Thunderbolt monitors (those support daisy chaining), or a Thunderbolt dock such as the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock or similar.\n", "Q: Finder in Catalina Doesn't Show Thumbnails When Searching SD Card or External Drive Finder in Catalina doesn't show thumbnails when searching external drives or sd cards.

I realised this when I tried to import my scanned photos into Lightroom and got an error that \"The file uses an unsupported compression algorithm\".\nFrom some online research and then trying it out myself, it appears that Image Capture for some reason switches compression when the cropping box is at a non-zero angle.\nI hope there is a fix for this, but I haven't been able to find any, which is frustrating. I'm now researching other scanning programmes, though the UI of most are not as friendly as Image Capture.\n", "Q: How To Change Apple ID associated with Apple TV?

And so this question may do nothing more than document another malfunction. \nMy current system: The hardware is MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019), my OS is macOS Catalina, ver 10.15.3, the software is Preview, Version 11.0 (999.4). My research turned up this not-so-helpful (at least in this case) document from Apple Support. \nI need to copy and paste data from bank statements that are delivered in PDF. I've done this for years, across several versions of macOS (most recently Mojave), and it's always worked. Today, for the first time, I downloaded some PDFs from the bank on my current system. Unfortunately, it seems Preview can no longer be bothered: \nPreview was unable to select (or copy) any data from any of the three PDFs I downloaded todayNote1. Here's what I did in an effort to isolate the problem: \n\n\n*\n\n*On my current system: I opened all 3 documents in both Chrome and Firefox browsers using the File... Open... menu. I was able to select and copy any passages I chose in both browsers. \n\n*On my current system: I opened several PDFs that I downloaded and saved from older macOS systems (Mojave, High Sierra, etc). I was able to select and copy any passages I chose.\n\n*I fired up my Mojave system, and opened all 3 documents in Preview ver 10.1 (944.6.16.1); I was able to select and copy any passages I chose. \n\n*I finally called \"Apple Care\" (now an oxymoron) to get help. After a 45 minute wait, and a lengthy conversation with \"first level\" support, \"second level\" support was summoned. Without hesitation, \"second level\" said this: \"Apple doesn't actually support PDF files with Preview. There is nothing we can do to help you.\" \nI know others have experienced problems with Preview and PDF files, but does anyone have any idea (or cogent theories) re the cause or the cure for this? For example, is it possible to downgrade to an earlier version of Preview on Catalina? \n \nNote 1: While the PDF was loaded in Preview, command A would select a few odd passages from the document - these were the bank's logo at the top of each page, and a long string that had no meaning to me - perhaps an internal document number? \n\nA: ICYI:\nAs it turns out, there is apparently an issue in Apple's Preview app. I took this issue up with another representative at AppleCare. Fortunately, this chap was not an arrogant idiot as the first one was. \nI finally got some feedback on my case today. Here's a brief synopsis: \n\nI received feedback from our engineers. They confirmed that there is an issue  with the Preview feature in Catalina. They were able to reproduce the issue by testing it on Macs running both Mojave and Catalina and got the same result that you did. This is something that has been reported and will be addressed in a future software update. \n\n\nA: Giving the Apply guy the benefit of the doubt, there's likely a gap between what he meant and what he said and what was understood. Otherwise he's an idiot.\nI can copy and paste text from PDFs that I have in Catalina; and Apple does indeed provide methods to select and copy text from PDFs in their frameworks for developers -- the same frameworks on which Preview is built. \nPDFs can be curious creatures, in that they are essentially code that has to be interpreted. The same page can be coded in many different ways, and some types of coding might be 'misunderstood' by the rendering engine. It's possible that the PDF-generating tool your bank uses may be writing the data out in a way that MacOS doesn't like. (Windows-based, commercial frameworks designed to auto-generate PDFs from database output are not without issue.)\nAt this point, it's impossible to know who is obeying the standard and where the bug is. (I can accept that you're unwilling to provide example PDFs of your bank statements for scrutiny!) Though clearly, something has changed between Mojave and Catalina.\nHowever, there have been issues of this sort several times throughout MacOS's history, and the usual fix is to 'rinse' the PDF through Apple's PDFKit by re-saving the PDF from Preview. You can try adding a harmless annotation somewhere to force a save.\nWhen saving a PDF, MacOS has to rewrite the PDF using its own data structures, and the revised PDF can then sometimes be understood by Preview more easily. \nIf that doesn't work, it's always worth having a second PDF viewing app that doesn't use MacOS's PDFKit, just to get a second opinion on a PDF. As you have found out, you can use Chrome or FireFox to copy from the PDF. Acrobat Reader is of course the gold standard; there's also Foxit Reader.\n", "Q: Any way to save/manage finder states?

I've had instances on several Macs, all running different versions of macOS suddenly lose connectivity to USB audio devices, and have slow transfers to USB drives.  A simple reboot and the problem goes away. (Normally, I would reset the USB bus, but found it easier to simply perform a system reboot).  \nNow, for me, this always occurred with bus powered devices.  Devices connected to a USB hub with external power supplies or devices that had their own power adapters never exhibited these problems so I chalked it up to too much power draw on the USB bus.\nImminent Failure?\nIs this a signal of imminent failure?  Not exactly.  Read/Write errors are symptomatic of imminent failure.  It's entirely possible that the USB controller on the external drive simply \"glitched\" or pulled to much power thus improperly resetting the USB bus.  If the problem exists after a reboot, you should start paying closer attention because it could be the USB port on the Mac mini equally likely as the USB interface of the external drive.\nDiagnostic Tools\nWhat tools can you use?  Unfortunately, none.  Getting disk status is limited to what ATA commands the USB to SATA controller on the enclosure is capable of delivering.  The WD Elements Portable is Western Digital's entry level line of external drives so they don't have any software available for diagnosis.  However, one step up, the Elements SE line,  does have Windows/Mac software specifically for diagnosing those drives.    You could give the software a go; the worst that can happen is it doesn't work for your drive.\nGoing Forward\nYour Mac mini is in a remote location that's now almost impossible to access.  When selecting your backup hardware, go for more \"robust\" products like the WD Passport or even the larger \"desktop\" drives with their own power supply.  You also want to have more than one in the event one fails.  \nIf you go this route, don't back up the backup.  Let it make it's own backup because if you happen to back up garbage onto the first, you don't want the second to be garbage as well.  I would even look to backup to the cloud for good measure.\n", "Q: Shell commands to determine if file is held on an APFS volume In a shell script, I need to determine if a file is held on an AFPS volume.

Inside is an AX88179 chip for which I installed the correct driver. When I start my MacBook or when I plug in my USB-C hub everything works fine. The interface is called 'AX88179 USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet 2'\nHowever, after a few minutes the connection stops working. In the network overview it shows the green dot with 'connected'. When I use the 'Renew DHCP Lease' option the dot becomes orange with the 'Self-assigned IP' message. I see a wrong subnet mask and get an IP that is not within the network (169.254.44.151). The cable is running straight to my modem/switch. WiFi is working just fine all the time.\nWhat I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*check if my Firewall is off, it is\n\n*deleted the com.apple.alf.plist file\n\n*removing and re-adding the ethernet interface in the network pane. This does not work at all.\n\n*Running sudo tcpdump -i en9 port 67 or port 68 (running sudo ifconfig tells me it is en9) and then renewing the DHCP lease. I get the following line a few times: [time] IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc > broadcasthost.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from [MAC address I suppose] (oui Unknown), length 300 and am still stuck with the 'Self-assigned IP'.\n\n\nHow can I fix the issue of the dropping ethernet connection and/or the self assigned IP?\n\nA: The fact that WiFi is working fine, tells you that the issue isn’t related to your OS.  Especially, your firewall can’t be an issue because a firewall won’t allow DHCP traffic then suddenly block it while simultaneously continuing to allow it for another interface.  The tcpdump is telling you that the DHCP client that requests the IP from the server is working fine.  The “oui unknown” means that the Organizational Unique Identifier (first 3 octets of the MAC address) can’t be found.  Which means it can’t identify the chipset.\nThat leads us to....\nThis chip, made by ASIX Corp is an off brand, low cost chip used in many discount peripherals also made by off brand and discount manufacturers.  In fact, a number of products based on this chip like this Plugable USB to Ethernet not only doesn’t list macOS as supported, it actually says not compatible with Catalina.\nThe problem then is the adapter and not your Mac.  Steer clear of off-brand products and look for adapters that use quality chipsets like Anker USB Ethernet Adapters (I personally use this brand due to their reliability and warranty; 18 months).  Generically speaking, look for chipsets from known, market leaders like Intel, Broadcom, Qualcom, Texas Instruments, etc.  Chances are, the WiFi adapter used by Apple for its AirPort adapter is a Broadcom.\n", "Q: Can’t connect my iPad to cPanel WebDisk (iOS) I am trying to connect my iPad to my webdisk, but I can’t.\nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*my address: example.com\n\n*my username: exemple@exemple.com\n\n*my password: example\n\n\nI figured out to connect my Windows 10 laptop, but I don’t know how (and I found nothing on Google) to connect my iPad (maybe using files app?) to the WebDisk...\n\nA: I found this article that was posted in 2017.

The problem is not with the hardware, it has to be related with software or OS.\nIf not, I cannot explain why it worked that time...\nWhat can it be? How can I solve it?\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: While I'm not sure what you mean by a controller board (is it a video card or a dock?), Here's a few tips to try. \nTest the cable against other cables and inputs. I recently had a mini display cable go bad when it wasn't that old. \nConsider connecting the cable directly to the monitor if you are passing it through other devices (IF Thunderbolt > External HD > Monitor, INSTEAD Thunderbolt > Monitor). \nYou could try resetting the NVRAM which would help your mac relearn your monitor. (Command Option P R after a cold 'Shutdown'). Google this for your specific OS.  \nTypically, I find a black screen when the resolution of the mac is set too high for the monitor or the refresh rate is incorrect. Match what you know what your graphic card can handle to the limitation of the monitor. If the mac's display setting are vauge, there is a utility called SwitchResX that might be helpful. You can specify the resolution of your monitor and customize it with resolutions, color profiles and shortcuts. It's free to try with some nagware or feature limitations. \n", "Q: Determine Device for a File In a shell script, I need to determine the device for a file, subsequent use with diskutil, eg...\n# ???

I can't seem to figure out how to build a text string that contains information from all of the cells in one row.\nI have columns that contain the subject's name, whether or not they have done an action and then the url to their personal gallery.\nThe last column is a formula to put together the name, , url link.\nWhat I want to do is have a footer cell that then puts all of those text strings together.\nSum doesn't work on cells with text. \nHow can I add all of the text strings in all of the cells in one column together, without having to manually input each cell into a formula?\nSome projects have 5 rows, which isn't too bad. However, the job I am currently attempting to track has 70 people. \nIt gets a little unwieldy to have to build a formula of A2&\" \"&B2\"&etc etc etc.\nCan I automate that in Numbers?\n\nA: Another solution is to use the CONCATENATE() function.\nSee the knowledge base for further details.\nExamples\nIf cell A1 contains Lorem and cell B1 contains Ipsum, =CONCATENATE(B1, “, “, A1) returns “Ipsum, Lorem”.\n=CONCATENATE(60, 60) returns “6060”.\n=CONCATENATE(“a”, “b”, “c”) returns “abc”.\n=”a”&”b”&”c” also returns “abc”, because the ampersand is the concatenation operator.\n\n\nTo add to every row, just drag the formula handle to copy the formula down.\n\n\nA: You can combine cells with strings by using &. So in your case it probably will be something like\n=C1&\" \"&C2&\" \"&C3\n\nwith C1/2/3 being the actual column references.\n", "Q: How to switch off mDNSResponder as it is draining my mobile data? I was shocked to see the received and sent bytes consumed by mDNSResponder in activity monitor, please help as it is consuming high mobile data.\n\nA: mDNSResponder handles DNS resolution in macOS. That means that when any other program running on the Mac wants to connect to an Internet server by name (e.g. Safari wanting to connect to www.apple.com), mDNSResponder is what does the research to turn that name into a numeric IP address so the program can actually connect to it.\nThis means three things: First, if you turn it off, your Mac will be unable to do very much on the Internet. Everything that uses DNS names will break, and that's basically everything that uses the Internet.\nSecond, it shouldn't be using that much actual data; lookups are pretty small, and in normal usage it won't do too huge a number of them. It might look like a lot if you're using something that shows cumulative usage, since mDNSResponder runs basically forever, so you'd see how much data it's used since the last time you restarted your Mac.\nThird, the data that it does use isn't really its fault (so to speak). It's doing things (and generating traffic) because other programs are doing things that require it.\nIf you are seeing a large amount of traffic from mDNSResponder, there may be something else going on. I'd start with a malware scan, and if that doesn't solve it look into finding out what all that traffic is and what program is triggering it, and stop it at that level.\n", "Q: Can't update locate db When I run sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb I get this:\nmktemp: too few X's in template ‘updatedb’\nchown: missing operand after ‘nobody’\nTry 'chown --help' for more information.\nrmdir: /tmp/locatepZ6k0NJsdA/mklocatedcjJiipxrq: No such file or directory\nrmdir: /tmp/locatepZ6k0NJsdA: No such file or directory\ninstall: missing destination file operand after '/var/db/locate.database'\nTry 'install --help' for more information.\nrm: missing operand\nTry 'rm --help' for more information.\n\n", "Q: How to wait until internet connection, before launching \"login item\" My Slack and a few other apps will automatically launch at login on my Macbook, since they are listed under \"login items\". However, some, like Slack, will launch before the internet is connected, and that causes them to flail. Is there some way to delay launching those apps until the internet is connected?\nWith systemd/systemctl, you can wait until \"network.target\" is made before running background process. I wonder if launchctl can do that.\n\nA: According to the Daemons and Services Programming Guide this is not directly possible via launchd.\n\nNetwork Availability\nIf your daemon depends on the network being available, this cannot be handled with dependencies because network interfaces can come and go at any time in OS X. To solve this problem, you should use the network reachability functionality or the dynamic store functionality in the System Configuration framework. This is documented in System Configuration Programming Guidelines and System Configuration Framework Reference. For more information about network reachability, see Determining Reachability and Getting Connected in System Configuration Programming Guidelines.\n\nApps should really work when network is unavailable rather than just failing but if you want to do it yourself you could remove their startup items and make your own Launch Agent call a script that waits for a connection like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a script such as ~/.local/bin/launch_my_programs\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile ! ping -c1 -W1 1.1.1.1 &> /dev/null ; do\n    sleep 1\ndone\nopen /Applications/BBEdit.app # or whatever apps you want\n\n\n\n*\n\n*create a .plist such as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/my.startup.plist and include full path of your script\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>my.startup</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Users/hali/.local/bin/launch_my_programs</string>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod +x ~/.local/bin/launch_my_programs to make your script executable.\n\n*launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/my.startup.plist to load agent.\n\n", "Q: Sync with icloud doesn't work The sync between icloud and my ipad and my mac doesn't, for all services (icloud drive, Ibooks...)\nMy mac is running Catalina 10.15.3\nMy ipad is running Ios 13.3.1\nNothing is sync on the devices but the data are available via icloud.com.\nHere's what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign off and sign in from I cloud.\n\n*Restart many times\n\n*Kill the bird process and deleting the ~/Library/Application Support/CloudDocs as described here  iCloud Drive Won't Sync on Mac\nThanks\nHere are the bird logs (via brctl log):\nERR  2020-03-17 20:45:57.392+0100] Terminal[8466]  Failed getting container for URL: <private>, error: Error Domain=BRCloudDocsErrorDomain Code=7 UserInfo={NSDescription=<private>, NSFilePath=<private>\n[note 2020-03-18 01:19:55.876+0100] revisiond[245]  Cache delete asked us to reclaim <private> with urgency 1\n[note 2020-03-18 01:19:56.881+0100] revisiond[245]  Cache delete asked us to reclaim <private> with urgency 1\n[note 2020-03-18 01:19:56.942+0100] revisiond[245]  Cache delete asked us to reclaim <private> with urgency 1\n[note 2020-03-18 01:19:57.014+0100] revisiond[245]  Cache delete asked us to reclaim <private> with urgency 1\n[WARN 2020-03-18 17:52:12.595+0100] revisiond[245]  This volume is runnning \"<private>\" which is not supported\n[WARN 2020-03-18 17:52:12.595+0100] revisiond[245]  This volume is runnning \"<private>\" which is not supported\n[CRIT 2020-03-18 18:51:36.306+0100] bird[583]  UNREACHABLE: can't open <private>\n[ERR  2020-03-18 18:52:41.542+0100] com.apple.CloudDocs.MobileDocumentsFileProvider[22633]  can't find image with size <private> for <private>\n[CRIT 2020-03-18 18:52:41.543+0100] com.apple.CloudDocs.MobileDocumentsFileProvider[22633]  Provider returned error from domain BRCloudDocsErrorDomain which is unsupported.

If the name is there, it returns \"0\". If not, it returns the name of the client. You may have to modify the formula a bit depending on the name of the table which has this year's clients and the exact cell addresses.\nIf you also wish to show only the yet-to-come (2019 only) clients as a list, you can then use Numbers' Filter feature. You can access this feature through the Organize option on the right in Numbers' toolbar at the top as shown in the picture below:\n\nThe filter shown in the picture above \"filters\" out any rows in the table \"Clients 2019\" whose \"2019 only\" column is equal to 0. \nIf you would like to copy part or all of the filtered table elsewhere for further processing for any reason, select all the names (and, for example, the No column or any additional column you may have if you like) and press Command ⌘+C. Then select a cell in a new table (in a new sheet or file in Numbers if you also like) and then press Shift ⇧+Command ⌘+V (keyboard shortcut for \"Paste Formula Results\" menu option). These commands, when applied to a filtered table, will only copy & paste the cells you selected from the filtered table.\nHope these help!\n\nA: So, just hacked this together using match() and iferror().

How should I get it out? I was cleaning and I accidentally got Lysol in my phone. I’m mostly concerned about my headphone jack because I can’t listen to music since it’s saying I have headphones on when I don’t\n\nA: I would take a piece of tissue and roll one corner into a tight long piece and slide it into the headphone jack and roll it around. This should clean out the jack. I'd recommend a cotton swab but I think the jack is too small. Maybe use a toothpick with the tissue paper. Be careful not to leave tissue in the headphone jack.\n\nA: I'm going under the assumption that you have the iPhone 6S or earlier as it was the last iPhone to ship with a headphone jack (this model is not water resistant).\nWhen cleaning, you're not supposed to use any sort of household cleanser.  A soft, damp cloth is all that you need.  If, you must disinfect it (due to possible viral or bacterial contamination), mild, soapy water can be used to dampen the cloth and another can be used to rinse it.  If there's liquid dripping from the cloth or phone, it's way too much.\nApple has an excellent support document - Cleaning your iPhone - that you should refer to.\n\nAvoid getting moisture in openings. Don't use window cleaners,\n  household cleaners, compressed air, aerosol sprays, solvents, ammonia,\n  abrasives, or cleaners containing hydrogen peroxide to clean your\n  iPhone. The front glass surfaces have an oleophobic coating.\n  (emphasis mine)\n\nWhile it does say not to use compressed air, I would suggest using the \"canned\" air (from your local retail/office supply outlet) and gently blow air into the headphone jack.  Note that I said gently - don't pull the trigger \"full blast\" when doing this.   Your objective is to dry out whatever moisture may be in there.\nThat said, you should be prepared for the end result being that you shorted the connections in the headphone jack (residue from the Lysol) and it either needs to be cleaned professionally or replaced (the jack, not the whole phone).\n", "Q: Use 3.5mm jack as line in for a musical instrument My iMac and Macbook Air only have one 3.5 mm jack each.

For now, I would like to plug in a 3.5mm cable to the output jack of the electronic drum kit and connect the other end to my computer to record the drum kit’s sound.\nThis was possible with my old 2009 white MacBook. Can this be done in the newer models?\nI found this thread and tried using a cable with three rings. This cable has a built-in mic, so the computer is picking up on its mic, rather than the drumset's output.\n\nA: \nI would like to plug in a 3.5 mm cable to the output jack of the electronic drum kit and connect the other end to my computer to record the drum kit’s sound.... This was possible with my very old 2009 white MacBook. Can this be done in the newer models?\n\nEmphasis mine\nYou can’t.  The audio jacks on all new Mac computers are microphone inputs and not line inputs, though they support line out.  The latest MacBook Pro (as of this edit) has a headphone port, but no indication of a line in.\n\n3.5 mm headphone jack with advanced support for high-impedance headphones\n\nMicrophone versus Line Inputs\nThe key differentiation between mic and line signals is the voltage.  Microphone voltage is extremely tiny (millivolts) where line level input is about 1 1/4 volts.  Macs aren’t recording/pre-amp devices and do not contain the necessary components to raise the voltage to line level.\nThe thread you referenced is about the TRRS jack or Tip, Ring, Ring, Sleeve and these are typically used in telco, not pro audio (yes, you can get very good quality sound from them, but they’re never found in even the smallest recording studio).  The cable, was just a \"breakout\" that separated the headphone (out) from the microphone (in) connectors.  It never converted a signal to line level.\n\nI realize the proper way of doing this would be to get an audio\ninterface, but I don't want to invest in one just yet.\n\nYes.  However a simple audio mixer that handles mic, line, and instrument (what you need for your drum kit) that also includes a monitor port can be had quite inexpensively.\n\nA: The response by Allan has it completely reversed. The 2009 Macbook had a line level audio input. Checking the specs on support.apple.com all current Macs also have at least a line level input (some have digital).\n\nAudio in: You can use this port to connect stereo equipment to your Mac with a stereo miniplug-to-RCA cable adapter. Some Mac computers also support optical digital audio input using the S/PDIF protocol.\n\nSource: About the audio ports on Mac\nI am aware it is three years late, but the actual answer to the question is yes. He can use a 1/4\" to 3.5mm adapter to plug his keyboard into a current Mac, just like he was able to do with the 2009 model.\n", "Q: Upgrade from Fusion Drive to SSD without breaking fusion first I replaced my fusion drive with a 1TB SSD but didn't break the fusion first.

There are also some other small volumes not shown for recovery, booting etc that you can see with diskutil list \nThese volumes are all part of the OS install in Catalina - see this Apple document About the read-only system volume in macOS Catalina.\nWhile you could try to roll your own fusion drive you'd be adding complexity for no benefit and if either drive failed you'd lose both - see how to prepare two SSDs after upgrade (merge to fusion drive or not, terminal commands)\nWhat you could do is install macOS to the SD0128F disk and use the new SSD as data storage either by manually saving your data there or by moving your whole user folder.

Now I'm looking to add a monitor connected via HDMI to this setup.\nCan I daisy-chain a monitor via the mixer by using a second firewire --> thunderbolt adapter combined with a thunderbolt --> HDMI adapter?\nHow would I go about figuring out the maximum supported resolution in this setup?\n\nA: You can't daisy-chain the mixer from Firewire up to display since they aren't compatible standards. You can use both devices with a single Thunderbolt 2 port, but you'll need to get a dock. OWC sells one with HDMI and Firewire, so you can plug your monitor and mixer into the dock and then one TB2 cable into your Macbook Air. There are other TB2 docks with a second TB2 port instead of Firewire, so you can use them with your existing Apple Firewire adapter.\nThe first commenter is incorrect on several parts.

I have four sets of Apple EarPods, with remote control and volume.\nI think everything has always been ok with all of them, but suddenly, I discovered a problem with one, which doesn't sound right when placed in the ears as usual.\nI need to put the volume level up to hear correctly with it, and I have discovered that if I put the long white part a bit up, rotating the headphone in the ear, I manage to make it sound better.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there different versions of the EarPods which would fit differently in the ears (I don't see any difference but maybe it's too small or only in the headphone design)?\n\n*If not, what could be the reason the volume is better when I move the EarPod differently? (Maybe it isn't working perfectly anymore and only a part of the headphone still send music?)\n\nA: \nAre there different versions of the EarPods which would fit differently in the ears ...\n\nAll Apple AirPods come in the same size but, unlike Apple AirPods, Apple AirPods Pro come in three different sizes in ear tips. Because they are of different sizes, those tips fit ears differently. So one of those three different pairs of tips might be able to help you get better performance than the others (and Airpods) if you would consider purchasing a pair of AirPods Pro.\n \n\nIf not, what could be the reason the volume is better ...\n\nSlight changes in how AirPods sit in your ears may change how the sound reaches into your ear because the directions of the speakers change as you move them inside your ears. However, unless the insides of your external ears have quite distinct shapes or you usually sit close to a high volume sound source, they should sit nicely in your ears and you should not have to move them frequently / drastically to hear comfortably. \nAirpods Pro may help in that regard as well, i.e. get a more consistent performance, because their tips fit relatively tightly into the entrance of ear canals. \n\nA: \nAre there different versions of the EarPods which would fit differently in the ears\n\nNo. There is only variety and size variant of EarPods manufactured by Apple.\nOne size to fit all was the original design goals, as stated by Apple in their EarPods marketing campaigns.\n\nIf not, what could be the reason the volume is better when I move the EarPod differently?\n\nIt likely has nothing to do with the EarPod itself but with the auditory perception corresponding to the placement of the EarPod in your ear.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use iphone as an usb or bluetooth webcam on imac?

I am setting up to live stream music. I've installed a virtual sound card (Blackhole) and created an aggregate device consisting of my mic input and the virtual output. I then set OBS to use the virtual device as the audio source, and switched on monitoring. It works! I can hear the music and my voice. The problem is that OBS is creating latency on the monitoring, so my voice is out of sync.\nSo, can I create an aggregate/multi device which has one input, and two outputs? That way I can have the input for the mic, output directly to my sound card so I can monitor, and have the virtual output going to OBS for the live stream. Is this possible? I can't find a way to add an input to a multi-output device, or to add more than one output to an aggregate device.\n\nA: Ah, I actually found a workaround. My music software (Reason) allows you to wire up the audio output to any channel on the device. Because I created an aggregate with the input and the two outputs, I could split the audio and wire it to the output channels for both the real sound card (for monitoring) and the virtual one (for capture by OBS). It works, and there's no latency.\n", "Q: How to restart SMB client on macOS Catalina? (Finder not connecting to shares) Once in a while Finder stops connecting to SMB shares.\nFinder → Cmd+K → Connect → It shows a window like this infinitely:\n\nWhat I've tried already:\n\n*\n\n*I have tried connecting to multiple shares (Linux, Windows), Finder didn't connect to any of them\n\n*Connecting with an alternative client works. For example, Kodi media player includes its own SMB client and it connects just fine.\n\n*Connecting from other running Mac works too\n\n*Reset Finder settings by deleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\n*Kill Finder with killall Finder command\n\n*Add username and password explicitly into the Cmd+K connect to server dialog: smb://myusername:mypassword@192.168.1.2/MyFiles\nI assume this is a macOS SMB client issue.\nThis issue will go away with a reboot. I'd like to fix the issue without restarting macOS – how can I restart SMB services only?\n\nA: As stated by @yssup - Using the mac \"Activity Monitor\" tool to stop \"NetAuthSysAgent\" solved the problem for me.\nNote that stopping \"netbiosd\" did not solve the problem.\nIdeally one would do this by clicking on a shortcut to a shell script which could stop \"NetAuthSysAgent\" more quickly and efficiently. However, I cannot figure out the correct shell command to stop \"NetAuthSysAgent\" programmatically. Perhaps someone else can answer that here.\n\nA: Alternatively you can achieve this with sudo pkill -i netauthsysagent. -i makes it case-insensitive.\n\nA: I had the same problem, solved it by launching Activity Monitor and stopping netbiosd process, it gets restarted and then the connections started working immediately.\nIt's possible that I also stopped NetAuthSysAgent process as well, so if it doesn't work for you with the netbiosd process only, try stopping NetAuthSysAgent as well.\n", "Q: Giving myself permissions in /etc/sudoers does nothing I want to give myself permissions to use pmset without using sudo.\nI added this line to etc/sudoers:\nmyname          ALL = /usr/bin/pmset\n\nBut when I save and close with :wq and run pmset, I get:\n$ pmset -b disablesleep 1\n'pmset' must be run as root...\n\nWhat is it I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: The sudoers file only gets read by sudo so you still need to run\nsudo pmset ...\n\nto execute the command. What your addition to sudoers does is that every user on your Mac can now execute pmset without entering a password (or even be in the admin group).\nIf you want to avoid having to type sudo pmset each time define an alias\nalias pmset=\"sudo /usr/bin/pmset\"\n\n\nA: The order of parameters in sudoers is like this:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL - This applies to user root\n  \n*root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL - This rule applies to all user root logged in from all hosts\n  \n*root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL - User root can run commands as all users\n  \n*root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL - User root can run commands as all groups\n  \n*root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL - These rules apply to all commands\n  \n\nYour addition myname ALL = /usr/bin/pmset to sudoers contains the first, second and fifth parameters and therefore means user myname on any host can run sudo pmset.  If they were a member of the %admin group (as the first user created on macOS is) they would have been able to do this anyway.\nWhat is doesn't do is tell sudo is that you don't want to enter a password which is done with the NOPASSWD parameter.  Therefore you want, as the last line in sudoers for myname: \nmyname          ALL = NOPASSWD : /usr/bin/pmset\n\nThis will let user myname enter sudo pmset without prompting for a password.

To do so edit YOUR.app/Contents/Resources/XY.lproj/InfoPlist.strings (with XY being the language you are using) and change CFBundleName there.\nFor applications without localization files you can also edit YOUR.app/Contents/Info.plist and set a new value for CFBundleName there.\n", "Q: How to find arguments to an application on macOS X?

I've had a quick look through the search results, and am not able to find a suitable answer. \nMy scenario is this - my mother in law in her 70s, is not all that keen on technology. She's also self-isolated thanks to Corona. \nWe're sending an iPad her way, that we can get 'set up' in advance... but what we really need to be able to do is remote-support it, because we can't go and see her in person.\nTo that end, I'm wondering what the best option would be for remote support. We have available an iPhone, a PC and an Android phone. \nI'm currently contemplating something like teamviewer (the 'quick support' looks to allow screen viewing which would be a start), but if there's a free option out there that'd be better still. \n\nA: The best solution we've found so far, is 'teamviewer quick support'.\nIt doesn't allow for remote control, but it does permit screen sharing. An app on the iPad generates a 'connection ID' and a remote client on a desktop system can then connect to it, and view the screen.\nIt's not exactly what we wanted, but it's sufficient to get started. \n\nA: You can use ordinary MDM software to manage the device to ensure that you can remotely control settings, install apps and make sure the user does not \"break\" the device.\nActual remote control is not possible on a system-wide level, unless you connect the iPad to a remote KVM type hardware. You can get remote control in a single app with apps that have that feature (mostly enterprise software).\nYou can get remote viewing using software like TeamViewer and ZoHo Assist.\n", "Q: How to allow the user to choose from a pricing package yet be compatible with volume purchase and family sharing I want to allow the user to pick the subscription package that is most convenient for their situation similar to how SAAS do it, eg.:\n\nI want it to have 3 tiers: Free, Standard, Pro\nAs I want to distribute it exclusively in the app store (to avoid setting up my own payment framework, backend, etc) I am limited on the payment options.\nI was thinking of creating 2 in-app purchases (Standard & Pro) but that will mean that users will not be able to use family sharing or do volume purchase.\nThe only solution I can think of is to create 2 extra versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*MyApp (free to download and with IAP available for upgrades)\n\n*MyApp Standard ($X to download, no IAP)\n\n*MyApp Pro ($Y to download, no IAP)\nBesides the extra work of managing and maintaining 3 apps (despite any automation I might do), there's still the issue of cannibalization of ratings and downloads number that affect the ranking of the main app.\nIs there another way to do this?\nApologies for the confusing title, not sure how to make it simpler.\nThank you\n\nA: You are correct that there are challenges with subscriptions and I would set aside VPP for now and focus on the tiers. Too many options will confuse everyone and complicate your efforts to track.\nThe Omni group does excellent work here - they offer a free app with read only functionality and a free trial subscription and two tiers. You could emulate their Mac App Store model quite immediately for either full purchase (and then annually release a new version)\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.omnigroup.com/omni-store-or-mas/\nI would then look at VPP - you can push your app to specific clients at pricing points you agree upon, or let them know you'll refund / rebate / discount them post purchase if it's too much work to negotiate one off SKU in the B2B / VPP store.\nThe benefit of this approach is you still get your free/basic/pro functions through IAP and can toggle the family share feature with one build and one review. You can even roll in a discount for IAP based on previous purchases - so everything I can see you need has already been done (and works for years already).\n\n", "Q: How do I grant access in Files and Folders in Catalina for Chrome?

I want to version these files in my dotfiles repo. I like my dotfiles repo to be in its own tidy folder so my general approach to versioning configs is to move the config file to my repo and then symlink it from the original location. This also allows me to rename the file to something convenient, even if the original developer picked a bad name for the config file. However this doesn't appear to work consistently on Macs - sometimes the symlink itself gets overwritten, sometimes setting the symlink to \"Locked\" fixes that and sometimes no.\nI find recommendations to symlink the directory itself rather than the file. However the Preferences directory is huge and I don't want to version the whole thing. How can I reliably symlink files in the ~/Library/Preferences?\n\nA: \nHow can I reliably symlink files in the ~/Library/Preferences\n\nDon't.\nThese files are generally not for user consumption.  They are the support files for the applications you use every day.  Some are nothing more than configuration files while others store data like (Firefox) recently visited sites, bookmarks, etc.  \n\nI want to version these files in my dotfiles repo.\n\nWhy?  Unless you're a dev, there's no reason to version these files especially since some change not just daily, but as you use the app.\n\nThis also allows me to rename the file to something convenient, even if the original developer picked a bad name for the config file.\n\nAgain, this isn't meant for general consumption and second guessing the developer and their naming conventions can cause issues.  For instance, many applications upgrade by simply downloading only the changed files while others download the whole application and simply overwrite what was there (Firefox is a good example). Either way, it's expecting it's support files to be where the dev said they would be.  There are also many cases in which the config file must be migrated as it uses a different format and the \"tools\" which the dev implements to do this migration may not be expecting a symlink.\n\nHowever this doesn't appear to work consistently on Macs - sometimes the symlink itself gets overwritten, sometimes setting the symlink to \"Locked\" fixes that and sometimes no.\n\nCase in point.\n\nI like my dotfiles repo to be in its own tidy folder \n\nOk...I can definately apprecieate a neat and orderly file hieracharcy.  However, since the applications will be expecting the Library files to be where they are originally, that folder will just be the same unorganized, badly named list of symlinks instead.  So, basically, all for naught.\n\nA: If anyone is wondering, my current approach is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modify some settings in the app, then quickly do find ~ -mtime -1m 2>/dev/null to see recently changed files and find the one where the app stores configs. (some apps don't actually write the configs until you quit them)\n\n*With the app closed, move setting to dotfiles repo: mv ~/Library/Preferences/com.someapp.whatever.blah.blah.plist ~/dotfiles/someapp-config.dat\n\n*Symlink from original location: ln -s ~/dotfiles/someapp-config.dat ~/Library/Preferences/com.someapp.whatever.blah.blah.plist\n\n*Lock the symlink so the app can't overwrite the symlink (it should still be able to change file contents): chflags nouchg ~/Library/Preferences/com.someapp.whatever.blah.blah.plist (this is the same as right clicking the symlink in Finder, selecting \"Get Info...\" and then \"Locked\")\n\n*Commit ~/dotfiles/someapp-config.dat to your repository. Usually these files are binary and the diff isn't too useful, so I suggest describing your configuration changes in the commit message. You probably also want to add the symlink and lock commands to a shell script to make deployment on subsequent machines easier (ideally it would be as easy as git clone DOTFILE_URL; ~/dotfiles/install-symlinks.sh).\n\n\nThis seems to work. Without the locking step, many apps would delete the symlink and create a fresh config file. But when it is locked they are forced to follow the symlink and work with the contents of the versioned file.\nI had one case where it seemed like the symlink was overwritten despite being locked, but I'm not entirely sure if I actually did lock it. After I tried again and made sure to lock it, I could not reproduce the problem - so maybe I just accidentally failed to lock it the first time. I'll edit the post if I find a reproducible case of the Lock not being sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to do it without locking at all (not tested, commands might have minor errors):\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy entire Preference dir to dotfiles: cp -r ~/Library/Preferences ~/dotfiles/\n\n*Replace original one with a symlink: ln -s ~/dotfiles/Preferences ~/Library/Preferences\n\n*You probably don't want to indiscriminately version your entire Preferences library, so add it to .gitignore: Preferences/\n\n*Use the same recently modified trick to find the relevant config file(s): find ~/dotfiles/Preferences/ -mtime -1m 2>/dev/null\n\n*The file won't show up in git status at first because it's ignored but you can still git add com.someapp.whatever.blah.blah.plist (changes in the file will show up in git status after it is added once)\n\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that you don't have to lock any files because even if a program deletes and re-creates the config file, it will still show up in the symlinked directory in your repo. The disadvantage is that you can end up with a lot of files in your local repo - with ordinary git usage and if you ignore them as I describe above, the files won't be committed or pushed to git, but if you ever manually copy the repository (as opposed to git clone like you should be) then you have to keep in mind that you are copying everything.\nI don't believe it is necessary to lock the symlink ~/Library/Preferences because that directory shouldn't be getting overwritten (as opposed to its contents).\n", "Q: “ActivityWatch.app“ wants access to control “System Events.app“ dialogs I installed ActivityWatch on my Mac (OS version: Mojave), and every minute or so it launches a dialog saying “ActivityWatch.app“ wants access to control “System Events.app“.\nHow can I get rid of these dialogs?\n\nA: Here is what I did that fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit ActivityWatch from the menu bar.\n\n*sudo chown -R root:wheel /Applications/ActivityWatch.app \n\n*In System Preferences / Security and Privacy / Accessibility, added ActivityWatch to list of applications authorized to control computer. \n\n*Restart ActivityWatch.\n", "Q: High Sierra in a MacPro 3,1 I have installed High Sierra in my MacPro 3,1 using Dosdude1 patcher and algorithm.

Connect to it from the iMac, and you'll be able to quickly switch control between the two computers with a keystroke and mouse-click.  You can control the MacBook Pro almost as though you sitting at the console: either in full screen or a separate window.  NoMachine is very configurable: it forwards audio, connects to local devices, etc.  \n", "Q: How to Check if a Number is Divisible by Another Number I am currently creating an AppleScript program that lets you see if the number you enter is divisible by another number. The code I use to see if my number is divisible by two (I think) works just fine:\nset twoCheck to (round (myNumber / 2))\nset twoCheck to (twoCheck * 2)\nif twoCheck = myNumber then\n    set twoCheck to true\nelse\n    set twoCheck to false\nend if\n\nTo determine if a number is divisible by three, you add up all of the digits in the number, and if the sum is divisible by three, so is the original number. I use this code to find the sum of the digits from the my number:\nset numString to (myNumber as string)\nset numCount to (number of characters of numString)\nset threeCheck to 0\nset numSelect to 1\nrepeat numCount times\n    set threeCheck to (threeCheck + (character numSelect of numString))\n    set numSelect to (numSelect + 1)\nend repeat\n\nThis code works just fine. I figured that if I used the same code to see if my number is divisible by two and just replace the two with threes, it would execute just fine and tell me if the sum of the digits is divisible by three. However, this not the case. It always returns either \"true\" or \"false\", and it's almost never accurate.\nMaybe this is super obvious, and I apologize, but I'm stumped here. Keep in mind that I want to find if the number I enter is divisible by any number, not just the number three (although in this case I do want to find if it's divisible by three, but in other words, this code needs to be expandable to other numbers). \nI'm fairly new to AppleScript and it'd be great if I could get some help on this. Thanks.\n\nA: Numbers don't work like that. Sorry.  There is a function that does exactly what you want but I don't know if it's available in Apple Script. The function is called mod. I know it's available in python. The function works like so. enter 2 numbers into the mod function. An example is mod(12,2). what you are asking is 12 divisible by 2. so you could have mod(14,2) mod(6894381,2). if the number is divisible by 2 the function is zero. Else its the remainder of the division as if you did it yourself. This also works for any number. mod(12,3) tells you if 12 is divisible by 3. mod(27,3) = 0, mod(26,3) = 2. so mod(300,50) is zero because 300 is divisible by 50.\n", "Q: How do I install Windows 10 on a Mac Mini that is booted from an external SSD? I have a Mac Mini 2018 that is booted from a 2TB external SSD. I would like to install Windows on the internal 256 GB SSD. Preferably using the entire internal disk. When I run Boot Camp  Assistant it complains External storage device Attached. The two alternatives that I have considered:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Windows 10 in a VM - I've done this in the past but was not satisfied with the experience.\n\n*Boot from the internal drive and install Windows 10 on a partition there. - This would be a waste of the limited space on the drive.\nI take Apple at its word that I can't resize the Windows partition after I create it. I don't expect to use Windows a lot, but when I do, I want it to behave itself. Can the process be completed without Boot Camp Assistant?\n\nA: The primary reason you can not resize the Windows partition is because the Boot Camp Assistant installs Windows at the end of the drive. If you do not use the Boot Camp Assistant, then you could place the Windows installation files in a ExFAT formatted partition at the end of the drive. Once Windows is installed, you can delete this partition and expand the main Windows partition to reclaim the space. Or, avoid the problem entirely and install Windows to the internal drive by booting the Windows installer from a flash drive.\nBelow are the steps for creating a flash drive installer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase the flash drive. Use a ExFAT format with a MBR partitioning scheme.\n\n*Mount the Windows ISO and copy the files to the flash drive.\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software.\n\n*Copy the Windows Support Software to the flash drive.\n\n\nYou will have to configure you Mac to allow booting from a flash drive. Once booted from the flash drive, I am not sure how far you can get using the GUI. You may need to use the CLI to complete the installation. I do know the driver used access the internal drive is not loaded until you reach the window asking for the product key.\n", "Q: mid-2011 27\" iMac won't turn on A couple hours ago, my faithful 2011 27\" iMac suddenly locked up hard.  Only way to bail out was a hard shutdown (hold power for 5 seconds).  I did that, and tried to reboot again to no avail.  No signs of life at all on pressing the power button.  No fans, no beep, nothing.\nI unplugged, waited 15 seconds (pressing power during that time just to make sure all juice was drained) and plugged back in.  Still no signs of life at all.\nI read about someone else having a similar problem and taking out and replacing the RAM fixed it.  So I pulled all the modules and tried to power up and see if I'd get any beeps or signs of life.  Nothing.\nI put the RAM back in, still nothing.  Unplugged every single peripheral (Thunderbolt and USB), nothing.  Swapped the power cord, nothing.\nI'm at a total loss.  Anyone have any ideas on why my machine just mysteriously died?  Any ideas what else I can try, to bring it back?\n\nA: EDIT 2:  Very strange addendum here.  This issue began again a few weeks after posting this answer.  BUT, I just discovered that while I have inconsistent problems manually getting the iMac to boot, a scheduled startup works perfectly fine, every time.  Go figure!\nSo this is totally weird and I can't explain it but...\nUnplugged the mac before I went to bed last night.  Came in this morning and tried firing it up before I remembered it was unplugged.  Spoiler alert - it didn't boot.\nRemembered about an hour later that it was unplugged.  Plugged it back in and just like that, normal boot!\nPlugged all my peripherals back in and it's like nothing ever went wrong.  I have absolutely no idea whatsoever what actually happened but, I'm back up & running.\nSo if by chance you're in my same boat, try letting it sit completely unplugged overnight and see if you have a similarly miraculous solution appear.\nEDIT:  Some additional information I just figured out over a month later that is related to this:\nShortly after \"solving\" this issue originally, I realized my UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) was crapping out and no longer holding a charge.  I suspected this was related to my problems so I ordered replacement batteries, swapped them out, and all has been good.  Until this morning.\nI woke up and once again, my machine was in a hosed state.  Wouldn't power up at all, no matter what I did.  This time even letting it sit several hours unplugged, changed nothing.\nFinally out of desperation, I decided to unplug from the UPS (which was still running and showing 100% battery) and plug into the wall directly.  Immediately, the Mac booted up fine.  No problems at all.\nI shut down, plugged back into the UPS, and... nothing.  No boot, at all.  So I shut off the UPS, waited 5-10 seconds, and turned it back on.  Just like that, the Mac booted up again fine!\nMoral of the story here is, if your Mac won't boot and it's plugged into a UPS, try power cycling the UPS itself.  Might save you a lot of headache.\n", "Q: Bluetooth audio is choppy / stuttering on Macbook Pro (Mojave) but not iPhone Audio playing from my Macbook Pro (Late 2016 15\" w/ Touch Bar, OS v10.14.6) to my true wireless earbuds (Jabra Elite 75t) is often choppy / stuttering. The problem seems to be with the Macbook because audio playing from my iPhone 8 Plus to the Jabra earbuds never stutters.

It is even pre-selected.\nI can tell that the display is definitely in HDR mode. Unfortunately it does not look very good. The fonts are weird, as if they aren't antialiased. It is especially noticeable in black-on-white text.\nIs there a way to improve the HDR mode?\nThe display is connected through USB-C. Changing resolution to Default for display does not help. I have used this display in HDR mode with ChromeCast Ultra so I know how good HDR can look.\n\nA: I have now realized that what I was seeing was the typical halo effect of high sharpenss. The image examples in this article illustrates the effect perfectly.\nDecreasing the sharpness from 10 (max, the default) to 1 (lowest) improved the fonts immensely.

Using the included software/drivers from Logitech (Logitech Options), you can assign the buttons keystrokes like F4 to display the LaunchPad.\n\nIf your mouse doesn't have this type of software, there are a couple of 3rd party options you can use\n\n*\n\n*USBOverdrive (Shareware; $20) - This will allow you to customize the buttons, wheels, switches and controls to custom program what they do - like assigning a keyboard shortcut to them.  You can use it for free but with the \"annoyance\" reminder. However, the product is good and worth the $20 for what it does.\n\n\n*ControllerMate (10 building blocks Free; $30 Commercial License).  This one is very powerful and you can control basically anything that has a switch - mouse, keyboard, switch box, MIDI device, etc.  You can create simple workflows like sending a keyboard sequence (if this is all you do, it will be free) or super complex workflows where the press of a button will do any number of steps (I personally use this)\n\nActivate Dock\nYou can \"move focus to the dock\" (the technical term) with a keyboard shortcut.  Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts.

However, I can advise you what to do next:\n\n\n*\n\n*Return it from where you purchased it (it may be defective)\n\n*Ask someone at Apple (on-line sales via phone or chat, or in person at the Apple store) what models the Lightning Dock is compatible with.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask them if there is a compatibility list.\n\n*Ask them if it works with your specific phone\n\n\n*If you get satisfactory answers, purchase it.\n\n\nIf it fails again, open a customer service inquiry and escalate. (If you do the pre-sales question via chat, you’ll have a record).  It may be completely incompatible with your phone and its a perfectly valid, albeit horrible, response/answer.\nIf you happen to be in store, open the box, hook it up, and make sure it works in font of the sales associate.. Tell him/her exactly what you’re doing and why.

Why is my girlfriend's 2017 MacBook air battery life so much better than my 2014 MacBook pro's (after just having brand new battery installed) when the batteries have the exact same device name (bq20z451)?\nFormat: her computer/my computer \n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: 1.8GHz i5/2.2GHz i7 \n\n*Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 6540/8230 \n\n*Cycle count: 628/10 \n\n*Device Name: bq20z451/bq20z451\nHers is notably better, maybe about 2x better.

Yes it's better than it used to be but nothing like when I first got the machine.\nDoes my 2.2GHz i7 processor really drain it 2x faster? Why would it matter if neither of us is maxing out the CPU anyway? Maybe my bigger motherboard is more demanding even when idling but really is it bad enough to account for this drastic of a difference? Bluetooth is off in both cases.\n\nA: You have the 15\" 2014 MBP, judging from the CPU speed. So you have an older CPU that uses more power; four times the number of pixels to push; and older battery tech. On the plus side, you have a larger capacity battery.\nYour MBP requires an 85W charger, and the MBA uses a 45W charger. So that's indicative of power consumption.\nApple advertised the 2014 MBP at 8 hours of wireless web usage; the 2017 MBA is rated at 12 hours. So you should see 1.5x on the MBA.\nI have the same model of MBP, and also recently got the battery replaced. I get about six hours using audio apps, Xcode, DTP stuff, etc.\nThe Device Name bq20z451 you quote is the model of the Battery Controller chip, rather than the serial of the battery itself, and is the same across a wide range of Macs with different battery characteristics.

First, make sure that you can access the CUPS web interface:\ncupsctl WebInterface=yes\n\nThen in your browser, go to http://localhost:631\nClick on Printers in the menubar at the top. Click on the print queue. Then choose Set Default Options from the 2nd drop-down menu. \n\n..\nYou may find a Fit To Page parameter, with options:\n\nBut the available options will depend on the definable characteristic of your printer. The fact that it is scaling suggests it does have such a setting.\nAs for the lp command: that command sends files to a print queue, and you can specify the job options that are used.

I typically have multiple terminal sessions across different screens. Since opening the terminal is such a frequent task, I have a hotkey bound to open -b com.googlecode.iterm2 . with Karabiner-Elements. This way I can open a terminal from anywhere with one keypress.\nUnfortunately if a terminal window is already open, this hotkey does not create a new window, but creates a new tab in existing windows. The existing window is often some long running \"background\" process like top or watch, meant to run undisturbed on a secondary screen while I do my work on the main screen. When a new tab is created in it, this causes problems for my workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hides the monitoring session, which I probably want to see\n\n*Opens the new terminal on the secondary screen, even if I had been working on the primary one\n\n*Moving the terminal to my main screen also moves the monitoring session to the main screen, so I have to move it back when done\n\n*Separating the tab requires finicky and tedious mouse dragging\n\n\nThese may seem like minor complaints, but I develop software and have to go in and out of terminals a lot. Depending on what I'm working on, I may need to open and close new terminals every few minutes, sometimes multiple times a minute. Reusing the same terminal is not really an option because often the terminals have distinct sessions (eg. TUI programs that run continuously, SSH to multiple different machines).\nIs there a command I can bind that also creates a new iTerm2 window?\nIn theory I could command-tab to the terminal first and use a hotkey to make a new window. This has 2 problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of one key press, I need to make several key presses to switch windows first.\n\n*Doesn't handle edge case where terminal is not running already.\n\n\nA: This is already built into iTerm2.  See the Hotkeys section in their documentation.\n\n*\n\n*Show/hide all windows with a dedicated, system-wide hotkey\n\n*Create a dedicated hotkey window.\n\nIn its simplest form, it's a system-wide terminal window that you can open with a hotkey.\n\nYou can find these options in Preferences -> Keys\nOSXDaily has an excellent write up on this (with pictures)\n\nA: One way is to tell iTerm2 what to do through AppleScript. You can bind keys in Karabiner Elements to call the shell command osascript to accomplish this.\nExample iterm2.json for this, using command-3 to open a new iTerm2 window using the default profile:\n{\n\"title\": \"New iTerm2 Window\",\n\"author\": \"Ahnberg <ahnberg@netnod.se>\",\n\"rules\": [ {\n        \"description\": \"New iTerm2 Window\",\n        \"manipulators\": [ {\n                \"type\": \"basic\",\n                \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"3\",\n                          \"modifiers\": { \"mandatory\": [ \"command\" ] } },\n                \"to\": [ { \"shell_command\": \"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"iTerm\\\" to create window with default profile'\" } ]\n            } ]\n    } ]\n}\n\nPut the json file in ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/ and then add it by going into Karabiner Elements preferences, selecting the \"Complex Modifications\" tab and clicking \"+ Add Rule\" in the bottom, and finally selecting \"+ Enable\" next to the rule.\nNote: AppleScript support for iTerm2 is currently in maintenance mode and might be removed in the future. They currently recommend using the Python API.\n\nA: Though it seems not to be a proper solution, you can try to use the drop-down terminal provided by iTerm in the Preferences->Keys->Hotkeys setting to create a hotkey window.\n", "Q: How do I pair a second smartcard to my MacBook?

I want a good quality but a reasonable file-size. And at least the Original Language (f.e. English) and the Secondary Language (f.e. German) and the optional subtitles too.\n\nA: First of all \"What are the best settings in HandBrake?\" is really up to you...\nBut you can find a lot of good tips on the web, as an exemple from Handbrake: Complete Step-by-step Guide:\n\nThe recommended settings for an x264 video encoding (which is the\n  default on Handbrake) is RF (Rate Factor) 18 to 22 for Standard\n  Definition. For higher definitions, you can play with the Quality bar,\n  19 to 23 for High Definition, RF 20 to 24 for Full High Definition and\n  22 to 28 for Ultra High Definition.\n\nFor a good quality, but a reasonable size, I'd say you have to have a size file to be at least 1280x720p\n\nRemember to get the Encoder Preset to the slowest mode in order to have the better result in size/quality !\n\nYou can set a favorite language (english & german) for audio and subtitles in both tabs. \nAfter finding the best settings that suite you, you can save the preset and let it be the one by default !\n\nA: HB includes some Apple and iTunes presets.  Start with those, and experiment.  You should be able to easily make files compatible with iTunes, VLC, etc.\nThe hardest thing I found was getting surround-sound correct.  I think the iTunes preset includes this, but I wanted to highlight this important part.  If you also want to play your movies on your iPhone/iPad, you MUST include a stereo track.  If you also want to play them on an Apple TV, etc, in surround-sound, include a second audio track (AC-3 passthru is usually the best here).  But, maybe sure the stereo track is FIRST, or the iPad won't play it (in Apple's app).\nSubtitles are very tricky too.  I'm going to use English as an example here, but adjust if you're trying to do this for another language.  For foreign-language DVD's, select your language (English) as the source, and you can set the subtitles to \"Burned In\".  This puts the subtitles as an image on top of the original video.  This is \"easy\" and the subtitles will always be there, in every app (because it's part of the video itself).\nBut, I've found HB's subtitle rendering to be a bit ugly.  Most apps (and the ATV) can do a better job at rendering them, so I recommend NOT choosing Burned In and leaving the subtitles in a \"soft\" format.  I think HB saves them as \"VobSub\".  This will work in many apps, like VLC I think, but not Apple's apps or the ATV.\nAnyway, you can then use another app called \"Subler\" to re-encode the subtitles as a \"real\" subtitle track (Tx3g format).  This is a little tedious, but it's really a much better subtitle experience.  Found out more at https://bitbucket.org/galad87/subler/wiki/Subtitles%20Guide.\n", "Q: Trying to update macOS to Catalina 10.15.4 asks to restart again and again When I open Software Update, I have:\n\nAn update is available for your Mac\n\n*\n\n*macOS Catalina 10.15.4 Update\n\n\nWhen I click on \"Update Now\", I have a window with:\n\nTo update, you must restart your Mac.\n\nIf I click restart, I effectively restart but when I try to update it asks\nto restart again.\nI have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and 12.29GB available.\n\nA: You need at least 20GB to install Catalina (macOS 10.15).

So I was trying to fix it. I didn't buy a new cable for replacement, instead I cut the original one and soldered on the circuit board.\nBut after I repaired it, I connected both sides of the adapter to my MacBook Air and to the power socket see if it worked. I saw the indicator lights up and then turns off immediately. After few times plugged and unplugged, I twice got a successful charge connection; the indicator turned green and then turns orange but it won't last longer than 5 minutes.   After a while the indicator will turn off again. These two charges got my MacBook 13% power.\nI measured the the T connector positive pins(Pin2/4); sometimes I got 0.8V, sometimes it showed 0.5v, I also measured the backside of circuit with multi-meter(yellow and red circle); the voltage showed was 110VDC. I think this adapter probably still working just don't know where I did it wrong.\n\nPlease give me some advice on what to do next to get this working.\n03/26 \nThanks for you guys reply.\nI was trying to measure voltage by the pin in the green circle, I got 55VDC, but suddenly there was a spark and then the voltage here were all gone, so I checked from the top and saw 3 SMD resistors next to this chip(green circle) were burned...\n\nI am thinking to replace them because it still recognizable.\nBut except that, I don't see any blown capacitor that might cause no charging.\nWould someone please share some advice?\n\nA: You’re getting the wrong voltage.  You should be seeing 3V not .5V.  Once connected to the Mac, it will sense the 3V then “request” the full 18V. \nWhat you measured was the incoming power of the mains so you “know” that it’s getting AC in. The problem lots on the DC side of things (after the rectifier) where something has gone bad. \nThese voltages are listed on Pinoutguide.com and on Wikipedia (6.86V for MagSafe and 3V for MagSafe 2)\nWhat’s wrong specifically?  You could have a blown capacitor, resistor or even an IC. You would need the schematics to see which line is sending the 3V and then make the diagnosis and repair. My thoughts are that something shorted with the damaged wire before you embarked on the repair. \nIt’s probably safer and cheaper to just replace charger and be done with it. \n", "Q: MBP Battery normal but won't charge, pro is now glitchy and slow I've got a MacBook Pro (mid 2012 using Majave) which was bought reconditioned 2 years ago.

A battery charging or not won’t have anything to do with the OS installed, how much space you have or even if there’s a virus. Remember, your battery will charge when the machine is off.

From Mojave in System Preferences / Software Update, I'm trying to update to Catalina.\nCatalina takes about 8 GB.\nThe network cable was a bit loose, and after about 6 GB (75%), someone touched the cable and the download was interrupted with an error message: \"Network connection was lost!\".\nI just clicked \"Ok\" (no reboot...) and was offered the update again. That I did. But the updater started almost from the beginning! (from 512 MB to be precise!). I was expecting MacOS to use the part that was already downloaded (or at least most of it), in order to spare another 30 minutes download!\nIs there a way (update from command line...) to tell MacOS to consider using the part of the file that was already downloaded at the time of the disconnection?\n\nA: Out of curiosity, considering you asked this 5 months ago, have you still not updated yet?\n\nNevertheless, here's my answer:\n\nAs far as I'm aware, if the connection is lost, the software update is cancelled, and there usually is no easy way to restart from where it was lost. A cancellation by definition usually involves the loss of progress.\nI suppose, however, that there may be some obscure method by which this might be possible (I see a few comments which have various suggestions), but to be honest, its far more reasonable to simply redo the update than to take the risk to tamper with the software which runs your Mac, especially during a major MacOS update. Its simply not worth taking the risk to save 30 minutes.\nI'm sure many people have had this sort of issue and wanted to do this before and if it was that simple Apple probably would've already made it so that you could start off from where you left. This suggests that it is not, so stay on the safe side.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nSo conclusion - maybe there is some complicated method which would do this, but my advice: don't risk it, just take a few extra minutes and you'll be safe, rather than sorry.\n\n\n\nA: As far as I'm aware this is not possible, the update process gets interrupted and the temporary download gets removed.\nThis is inefficient, but due to the tool softwareupdate being apple proprietary there is no at home fix for this.\nTo prevent this from happening in the future, you might be able to download the update manually with wget from a server that supports download continuation. (Most webservers these days)\nBut unless you're heavily starved on a data cap, just restarting the download from start saves you from a headache\n\nA: In most cases a \"stuck\" update can be fixed by booting into the Safe mode - reboot holding down shift key - and at the login screen, click restart and let system reboot normally.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1843752\n", "Q: Resize APFS (encrypted) container I am having trouble \"attributing\" some free space I have available on the Files partition to the volume which contains system files: an APFS encrypted container. \nI would like to do this because I am no longer able to update some large application from within the App Store.

I have an unused/unopened 250bg SSD sitting on a shelf and was thinking of buying a matching one for ~$60 and a Tray Adapter ($8) to replace the optical drive and running both SSDs in a RAID0 config.\nI do both design and front-end dev work so I typically have photoshop and illustrator open along with a bunch of browser windows and tabs and/or several VScode tabs while running a LAMP or MERN stack along with a bunch of browser windows and tabs. \nMy desktop can handle all that at once, but if I could get away with running even half (either the PS/Illustrator/Sketch/XD side OR the VSCode/MERN) at a time on this laptop, I'd be psyched. I only use while on the road (which is not very often) and while making system or hardware changes to my desktop.\nThe main drive is SATA3 and the optical drive is SATA2, which I'm sure would slow things down at startup using RAID0. But I'm wondering (hoping) if, that aside, the RAID0 configuration will boost performance/speed for the kind of work I'll be dong? I'm sure anything will be an improvement from the HDD, but will RAID0 (with 1 disc being connected via SATA2) give me a noticeable increase in performance over just a singe SSD on SATA3? >= $68 worth of improved performance? =)    \n\nA: If you have to stripe data across both drives, then you'll be constantly limited by the SATA II bottleneck. \nYou'd be much better off just buying a larger SSD for the hard drive slot, or installing two separate SSDs as separate drives.\nAt best, you might want to look at creating a Fusion drive between a larger mechanical in the Optical slot and an SSD in the HDD slot.

Only automatic and manual are present, and in manual you have to enter a number.  There's nothing ABV related.\n\nA: Modern macs will generally only support AVB when you hard wire an Ethernet cable directly to a USB-4 (only USB that works) / Thunderbolt port.\nAudio Video Bridging is a set of technologies that allow Ethernet to support the kind of time-sensitive data delivery needed to keep multiple connected audio devices in sync. It is not trivial.\nApple does not advertise which computers or connections support ABV. It seems most Macs today can support it, but only on a limited number of interfaces. In particular, there is no ABV support over WiFi or via a USB-to-Ethernet adapter. In fact, I cannot even get ABV to work when connected to a Thunderbolt 3 Dock.\nIt seems the only way to get ABV support is to connect to a built-in Ethernet port if the Mac has one or to connect via a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter. This is hinted at by the help message from Audio Midi Setup when you do not have AVB enabled. It says in part\n\nSee the help guide for configuration instructions if your computer does not have built-in ethernet or if it has more than one network service that can support AVB.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not know what \"help guide\" it is referring to, but it does lend support to the idea that AVB is only supported by \"built-in\" Ethernet.\n\nA: Most network interfaces don’t support ABV so most people will see no devices. The help guide isn’t clear, direct or helpful.\nWe would need to know your exact marketing name for your Mac and the exact full chain of how an Ethernet cable or hard wired network is attached to your Mac to confirm this is the case. Since your Mac runs Catalina, it’s probably just your network setup that needs attention.\nI remember this from my days of dealing with PreSonus equipment...\n\n*\n\n*Any Mac with with a Thunderbolt Port had support for AVB\n\n*Requires macOS 10.10 or later\n\n*USB-Ethernet is not supported\n\n*Only one device is supported at a time\n\nIf you aren't seeing the option (\"it doesn't exist\") that means AVB isn't supported with that particular connection.\n", "Q: Can I downgrade macOS to OSX Mavericks if the earliest OS that came with my Mac is macOS Sierra? Google gives me conflicted answers on this.\nOn Apple's website it says that the earliest os you can restore to is the one that originally shipped with your Mac.\nHowever, I found articles and links like MacWorld that says otherwise. So I thought maybe there are some tricks that can be used to accomplish that goal.\nIs this possible ?\nThank you for your help.\n\nA: If your Mac originally shipped with Mavericks, then yes, you can install Mavericks on it, regardless of whether when you bought it, it had Sierra on it.\nOtherwise, no.  Think about it.  If your Mac was released after Mavericks, Mavericks won't have hardware drivers for it.\n\nA: \"Mavericks doesn't know how to run computers from the future.\" If your Mac is newer than October 2014, it was built after Mavericks was finished.\nDepending on why you want to run Mavericks, there may be other solutions, such as using a Virtual machine, or using different applications.\n", "Q: iMac High Sierra-Windows 10 So, I installed Windows 10 on iMac mid 2011.

I tried booting a USB with High Sierra installation, but it is not showing up!\n\nA: If you installed over the main partition, then I would assume you will not be able to go back and boot macOS. You will need to reinstall macOS. Windows should be installed to BIOS boot. If you did this, then you probably will have to erase the entire drive before reinstalling macOS. If you installed Windows to EFI boot, then you will not have to, but you should since the Window Support Software was designed for BIOS booting Windows.\n", "Q: \"File is Locked\" message for a folder with thousands of subfolders/files After transferring a massive code project to my Mac, I noticed I couldn't write anything to the files inside due to the \"File is Locked\" plus an access denied message.\nUnlocking the root folder didn't help, chmod didn't make a difference, and granting read-write to everyone and applying to all subfiles didn't help either.\nIs there a terminal command I can use to programmatically unlock all folders and files below a specific directory?\n\nA: I found a perfect terminal set of commands buried in a forum post here: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-batch-unlock-numerous-files-within-subfolders-folders-directory.453818/\nHere's the commands I used (my project was located at /APPS/MYAPP):\nexport UNLOCK=/APPS/MYAPP\nfind $UNLOCK -type f -exec setfile -a l {} \\;\nfind $UNLOCK -type d -exec setfile -a l {} \\;\n\nThe type argument is f for files, d for directories. \nThe exec argument passes setfile, from the xcode developer tools (may need to be installed first), and uses lower-case L to \"unlock\" (bizarre command line syntax, I know)\n", "Q: How to Unlock iOS 12 with passcode, without disabling touch ID Is there a way I can force a prompt for passcode unlock without disabling touch ID? \nI have some gloves with capacitative tips on the index fingers.

I'm trying to make a scatter plot in Numbers but can't get it to work. If I select column A & B and have it make a scatter plot it uses column A for both axes.  If I click on the plot and go to  Series, it shows the values used for x and y, See the image below.\n\nThe above image is what I get when I select columns A and B to try and plot. If I go into that setting box and manually change the y-axis to column B it changes it back to A when I click plot. I tried this several times changing either the x-axis or the y-axis and the same thing happens. It keeps plotting the same values for both x and y.\nI can't use a line plot because a line plot assumes the points on the x-axis are evenly spaced and distorts your plot.\nAn example of the numbers I am trying to plot is given below.\nX-values  1,2,5,7,8,9\nY-values  43,56,103,156,215,300\nI just want a simple x,y plot...

So I am unable to tell you what possibly the problem is in your case. \nIn addition, I tried a few slightly different procedures, including the one described in this Apple support page, to create a scatter chart using the numbers you have given as an example and all turned out to be successful. I am attaching below the outcome of one of these trials. \n\n", "Q: Why does my new bootable external SSD show up as 2 volumes? I have an iMac (model 18,2) running Mojave. I have installed a new external (USB 3.1) SSD, and installed Catalina on it (and am in the process of migrating to it as the primary load source).\nWhen I am running under Catalina, both the new SSD and the internal hard drive show up as single volumes (\"SanDisk SSD\" and \"Macintosh HD\"). But when I am running under Mojave, the SSD shows up as two volumes: \"SanDisk SSD\" and \"SanDisk SSD - Data.\" Moreover, when I put custom icons on those two volumes (via Get Info) from Mojave, then reboot to Catalina, it's the icon I applied to \"SanDisk SSD - Data\" that appears.\nThis is most confusing. Can somebody shed any light on what's going on?\n(FWIW, my customary disk drive icons are based on a photograph of a 1960s-vintage removable disk pack, of the sort that might go into a \"Merlin\" drive on an IBM 370 or compatible.)\n\nA: You are seeing Catalina's way of setting up boot volumes, that's all. In Catalina, when you install macOS on a drive, it gets split into two volumes behind the scene: one read-only where the system and all system files reside, and one writable where your user files and every file that must be writable resides.\nThis is a way to further harden and protect the system from any accidental or malevolent change. The split is done by some file system level 'magic' and the volumes occupy overlapping space on the physical disk.\nThe preceding is a bit simplified, but you get the idea. When you see this volume in Catalina, it is presented as a single volume to the user. But when you see it in Mojave, it is shown as the two volumes it appears to be for Mojave, since Mojave has no knowledge of Catalina's boot disk setup scheme.\nTo use under Mojave, you can just ignore the volume without the \"- data\" and use the volume with \"- data\". All changes you do to that volume (as you have already seen with the icon) should show up back in Catalina.\n", "Q: how to delete the apps all data?

Naturally, she often plays with the passcode input buttons, and I get the \"iPhone is disabled, Try again in X minutes\" message, which I've googled and googled and there doesn't seem to be any way to turn it off. Not only is it annoying, but I'm worried that at some point she will enter the passcode wrong so many times, that the phone will be completely disabled.\nI seem to recall in older iPhones I could just not have them require a passcode at all to wake, but this seems impossible now, unless I also want to disable Apple Pay, Face id to login etc. I'm fine with those requiring a passcode.\nHow can I prevent this dreaded \"iPhone is disabled\" error?

I rarely reboot my computer, but I had to turn it off to move it home due to Coronavirus, and I when I rebooted I found I had received an unwanted change.\nNow, whenever I click a menu item (that is, the menus in the top left corner, for instance at the moment I am in Chrome so I have the items Chrome File Edit View History Bookmarks People Window Help), it gives little numbers on the left alongside each drop down menu. For instance when I click the File menu, I get a little 1 alongside New Tab, a little 2 alongside New Window, etc. \nAnd, clicking these menus is really slow. Even when I select something which does almost nothing (e.g. I click File, then change my mind and click File again to close the drop down menu), the little numbers stay around for about a second, and during that time I cannot do anything else. This ~1 second delay is really annoying, like I am running an overloaded or outdated computer (which I am not). Even worse, Cut + Paste takes several seconds.\nI suspect these little numbers are the cause. So now for my question: how do I disable this feature?\n\nA: You have accidentally enabled Catalina's new accessibility voice control feature, which lets you control the computer with your voice. The numbers you see are there to use as lables you can speak to exectute the commands. The same feature is also the cause of the slow-down in response. \nTo disable the feature, open System Preferences from the Apple Menu, go to Accessibility and disable it from there.\n", "Q: Migrating Mac to Mac via iCloud Is it possible to migrate MacBook completely via iCloud? When you restore iPad iCloud backup from another iPad you get everything -- settings, apps, data. Is it possible to do the same on MacBook, including cloning the installed applications and all the data and settings?\n\nA: Although you can get whatever you can on your iPad via iCloud also on your new Mac via iCloud, you can not completely migrate Mac to Mac via iCloud. But, note that, this is actually (via iCloud) how I migrated to my new MBP last year as I preferred to have it set up fresh and I don't have too much data (just a few GB) outside pictures and music.\nEven if you enable every iCloud category in System Preferences > iCloud, iCloud only synchs your user data files such as office documents, pdf files as well as pictures, contacts, calendars, etc. \nUnless you are subscribed to Apple Music or iTunes Match or they reside as regular files under the Documents folder, you won't have access to your music via only iCloud. iCloud will neither install the applications you have on your previous Mac onto the new one nor customize them or your system settings the way they are on your previous Mac. However, you can download the applications you have obtained from App Store with your previous Mac by signing in with the same Apple ID in your new Mac from App Store again. \nApple recommends that you migrate from one Mac to another using Migration Assistant if you wish to do it as completely as possible.\n", "Q: AppStore require apps for iPhone and iPad to be build with iOS 13 SDK after June 30, 2020 Is possible to build and deploy the first versions of the app with iOS 12 SDK, before the deadline(June 30, 2020) and after that to upgrade to iOS 13 SDK the app and the new updates so all the users will have the minimum first versions of the app, but the new updates after June 30, 2020, to be for users that can and have iOS 13?\nCan someone guide me towards a tutorial or something to clarify if it is possible and how should I approach this?\n\nA: Yes, that is entirely possible. It is just setting the target version to iOS 12 in the first version, and iOS 13 in the second version. You will have to set the iOS 13 release to be timed for release on 30th of June, but apart from that there's nothing \"special\" in this.\nNote: It seems you might have mixed some things up. The deadline requirement for June 30th 2020 is just that the app is to be built with the iOS 13 SDK - it doesn't mean that you have to set your target deployment version to iOS 13. So you can definitely build with iOS 13 SDK to fulfill the deadline requirement, and still only require iOS 11 or iOS 12 or whatever you need. \nUsers on iOS 12 (or even earlier) should have no problems running apps built with the iOS 13 SDK as long as the target deployment version is set accordingly.\n", "Q: How to get Brew formula from the filename of installed binary?

This makes it extremely frustrating when working remotely to my Mac because I cannot risk rebooting it, otherwise I have to go physically log into it in order for TeamViewer to fire up.\nThis was not the case for the past 7 years I have been using Macs.\nIs there any way to turn off this delayed-load nonsense? I looked everywhere in preferences and Google'd away but either I am not googling the right terms or no one's noticed.\nMy PCs still work fine after a reboot, FTP, RDP, TeamViewer, IIS all work upon booting a PC on Win10 without having to log in. But, of course, not Apple...\n\nA: If you've turned on Disk Encryption, then you might get the login from a small boot partition, which then boots the 'real' system after you've authenticated the unencryption with your password.\nAlternatively, it may be that Catalina's increased security is more cautious about how third-party software launches at this stage.\nIf you have just updated to Catalina, then you will need to check that your apps are compatible with Catalina. You may need new versions. \nThe other option, if your Mac is located in a secure location, is to turn on auto-login in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options.\n", "Q: Conflicting Disc Utility Details - Failing Drive 2010 MacPro Yosemite \nA TimeMachine backup attempt gave me an error message of a bad backup drive. Disk Utility shows -\n\nThis drive has a hardware problem that can't be repaired. Back up as much of the data as possible and replace the disk. See an authorized Apple dealer for more information. \n\nNow, the back up drive was one partition of a larger drive. This is the alert when on the full drive. Each partition passes the disc verify test. The latest backup occured this morning despite the alert from TimeMachine, and the current status from Disc Utility. \nQuestion - Does this problem alert from Disc Utility make sense, that a drive fails S.M.A.R.T. Status but its 2 partitions look fine? \n\nA: Disc Utility isn't always the best tool for something like this.\nI would probably throw something like this at TechTool Pro, Paragon Hard Disk Manager or DiskWarrior* for a good 'second opinion'. \nI would also be careful & make sure I had a good clone of it first - Carbon Copy Cloner\n*DiskWarrior is extremely good with Time Machine drives, as they're always HFS+, but can't handle APFS & doesn't deal with the entire drive like the others, only partitions.\nI've had TTP fix things DW couldn't & HDM fix drives containing Windows partitions that the others couldn't - so there is no clear 'winner' between these three.\nTTP contains SMART monitoring software too.\nIf I could only have 2 of the 3, I'd go TTP & DW, probably in that running order.\n", "Q: I think my drives are in the wrong bays on my iMac I bought a used 2011 iMac a couple years back. It till had the original HDD so I bought a 250gb SSD to use as the main/boot drive and a 1TB HDD.  I brought it to a shop that does work on Macs and they installed everything for me. I thought the SSD was going in the main bay, which is SATA3, and that the HDD was going to replace the optical drive, which is SATA2. I never gave it a 2nd thought.\nRecently I was looking at my system information and saw that the SSD is only getting a link speed of 3 Gigabit and the HDD is getting 6. See below:\nSSD\n\nHDD\n\nAnd unless I''m mistaken, it looks like there's an extra unused slot in there too? I know I should have checked this a lot sooner and there's nothing I can do about it now, but \n\n\n*\n\n*Did the guy put the HDD in the SATA3 slot and the SSD in the SATA2 slot?\n\n*Did he unnecessarily remove the optical drive when he could have used an available bay?\n\n*Would switching them so that the SSD (boot drive) is connected to the SATA3 controller produce any sort of noticeable difference?  \n\n\nA: Yes, the SSD is only getting 3 GigaBit Link Speed. And, you are correct with respect to having the ability for a third drive. \nFrom the everymac's website:\n\nThe \"Mid-2011\" iMac models all support a single 3.5\" hard drive and a second 2.5\" SSD. As shipped, both the hard drive bay and SSD bay provided support for the 3 Gb/s Serial ATA 2.0 standard. However, as first discovered by site sponsor Other World Computing, the iMac EFI Update 1.6, released two days later, quietly provided faster 6 Gb/s Serial ATA 3.0 support for both of these connectors (but not the optical drive connector).\n\nThere is a video titled 2011 21.5-inch iMac HDD Upgrade.\nThere is also a video titled 2011 27-inch iMac SSD Bay Drive Install.\nAnswers to Your Three Questions\n\n\n*\n\n*Did the guy put the HDD in the SATA3 slot and the SSD in the SATA2 slot?\nIt would appear the new HDD replaced the old HDD. The HDD cable should have included special hardware so the fans would work correctly. For example, see the OWC In-line Digital Thermal Sensor for iMac 2011 Hard Drive Upgrade. The SDD was probably replaced the optical drive and is connect to the logic board where the optical drive was connected.\nI am typing this answer on a iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011). Below are my images, which you can compare to your images. This Mac has the original HDD and optical drive.\nOptical Drive\n\nHDD\n\n\n*Did he unnecessarily remove the optical drive when he could have used an available bay?\nAccording to OWC, the answer would be yes.\n\n*Would switching them so that the SSD (boot drive) is connected to the SATA3 controller produce any sort of noticeable difference?\nYes. Do the math. According to the product flyer, the sequential read speed is 530 MB/s. Multiply by 8 to get bits per second and you get 4.24 Gb/s. This is faster the the link speed of 3 Gb/s.\nAlthough, switching may not be a simple task, if the cabling included additional hardware to measure the temperature of the new HDD drive. You probably would be better off using the third bay designed for a SSD.\n", "Q: Unable to boot Mac OS and disk utility unable to repair disk after bootcamp delete windows partition I’am not so sure

My guess would be to change the value to 976695384. I would wait and see if someone else has a better idea. \nThe command to do this are given below. Here, I assume you have booted to a newer version of macOS Recovery.\ngpt -f remove -i 2 disk0 \ngpt -f add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 976695384 -t apfs disk0\n\nThe older versions of macOS Recovery would require the longer commands given below.\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0\ngpt remove -i 2 /dev/disk0 \ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 976695384 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\nWhy 976695384?\n\n\n*\n\n*Reason 1: The error message from your question, which is repeated below.\nwarning: nx_block_count is 122086923, while device block count is 90820347\n\nSince the device block size is 4096 bytes and the sector size is 512 bytes, the conversion requires multiplying by 8, as shown below.\n122086923 blocks * 8 sectors per block = 976695384 sectors\n\n\n*Reason 2: This is the largest sector size that will hold complete blocks. If you take 976695387 sectors and convert to whole blocks by dividing by 8 and discarding the remainder of 3, you get the following. \n976695387 sectors / 8 blocks per sector = 122086923 blocks\n\nNext, convert back to sectors, as shown below.\n122086923 blocks * 8 sectors per block = 976695384 sectors\n\n\nThis can be computed in your head. Basically, you divide the last three digits of 976695387 by 8 to get the remainder. In other words, 387 / 8 = 48 with remainder of 3. Next, subtract the remainder from 976695387 to get the result. In other words, 976695387 - 3 = 976695384. Why the last three digits? Well, 976695387 can be written as 976695 * 1000 + 387. Since 1000 is always evenly divisible by 8, you only need the last three digits to get the remainder.\n\n \n", "Q: Keynote keyboard shortcut to navigate between objects on a slide If I am typing in the Title box and I want to keep my hands on the keyboard, is there a shortcut for me to navigate to the next text box or bulleted list (or whatever) on the screen without having to use my mouse?\n\nA: You can navigate between text boxes on keynote without using your mouse and only keyboard by using the tab key.

This monitor does have two speakers, I tried the following:\n\n*\n\n*First checked to see if audio would go through the HDMI port but no luck. When in the audio settings it says that \"The selected device has no output controls\".\n\n\n*Second I followed the manual which says connect the provided audio chord into the Audio In port and connect the other to the mac. I connected this through the headphone jack but still not luck.\nSuspected Issue\nI am guessing the audio must come from USB Type-C port and then use an adaptor to connect this into the audio jack on the monitor\nQuestion\nBefore I go through the hassle of ordering this online, could someone confirm my suspicions that this is the problem or is there something I am overlooking?\n\nA: The issue that you’re running into is that you’re going from DisplayPort to HDMI (signal conversion).  Now DisplayPort as an industry standard has support for audio as does HDMI.  However, DisplayPort and HDMI are very different signals.\nWhat makes this confusing is that we bring the term “USB-C” into the mix.  USB-C is just the physical connector type.  That port on the MBA is several signals, including DisplayPort, in one port. \nThe first thing I would look at is going with an Active Adapter, not a passive one (cable) that just re-orders the pinouts to match what you need. \nAs for your audio, I’ve never been a fan of integrated audio speakers in monitors and definitely not a fan of HDMI video connections in my compute environment - it’s a consumer grade AV spec that I’ve found very flaky.  I would go with a USB audio adapter (DAC) that can connect to a much better set of speakers or even audio amplifier.\n", "Q: Red dot showing in the software update icon but already updated I just updated my Macbook to the latest version of Mac OS: Catalina 10.15.4.\nHowever, I noticed that in the system preferences, there is a red dot on the software update icon, but after clicking it, it says it is already up to date...\nSo I want to know why it is here and how can I get rid of the red dot?\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nFortunately, after upgrading to 10.15.5, the red dot disappears...\n\n\nA: defaults delete com.apple.systempreferences AttentionPrefBundleIDs; killall Dock\n\nThis can get rid of it but it will return.\n\nA: Try running softwareupdate -ia in terminal to force it to realise it's got them all / install any you may have missed. \n\nA: Permanent solution (close \"settings\" window first):\nVia Terminal:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.preferences.softwareupdate.plist\ndefaults delete com.apple.systempreferences AttentionPrefBundleIDs\ndefaults delete com.apple.systempreferences DidShowPrefBundleIDs\nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: I can't take the credit but saw the solution from Macrumors forum:\nSimply delete the following file\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.preferences.softwareupdate.plist\nExactly same situation.

All I want to do is read it.  Are there any good apps for reading MS SQL backup files on mac?  Thanks!\nYou can see that I selected the correct answer below, but for the future reader, it was this step by step article that walked me through it and made the whole things easy:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/tutorial-restore-backup-in-sql-server-container?view=sql-server-ver15\n\nA: If you have or install Docker on your Mac, you can install Microsoft SQL Server in Docker from:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server\nWhen you have the server running locally, you can install the free Azure Data Studio for macOS from here:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15\nThat is a graphical tool that will let you for example restore the backup file you have received. You can then export the data in the format you need to continue working with it with other tools.\n\nA: No. Beg, borrow or rent a MS SQL and next time have them export in SQL text or work with you on a better format. \nSince they want you to read the data, I would see if you can use this awesome Mac app to just connect and run your report, look or export to a better format using Mac native tools. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.sqlprostudio.com/\nIf that fails, the fastest and cheapest avenue to MS SQL is a $200 free trial in azure. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/\nAlso, you can manage sql directly from Mac with Code. This might help reading the dumps or csv \n\n\n*\n\n*https://code.visualstudio.com/\nHopefully someone will have a better recommendation, but Azure is super cost effective as you can power off the VM as soon as you’re done and the storage costs are very reasonable once you export the data to a storage bucket.

Using Netstat (within Network Utility), I discovered an unusual IP address -- this IP address occasionally uses 9 different open ports, including ports 9998 and 9999. I also did an Zenmap scan, and it said the service name for port 9999 is \"abyss\" -- I looked up this up, and apparently it is a malicious service.\nThe unusual IP address appeared within the Netstat option, \"Display the state of all current socket connections\". The IP address does not appear to be associated with any applications on my computer (e.g. it isn't from Apple, Amazon, etc.) \nThe unusual IP address appears to be using the following open ports: 22, 80, 110, 143, 443, 993, 995, 9998 and 9999. Apparently ports 80 and 443 use the \"http\" service.\nI've been trying to figure out how to close these open ports, but I can't figure out how; it is very frustrating. I'm using Mac OS Sierra. The \"lsof\" command in terminal doesn't work. I type in lsof (for example, lsof -i:9999) and nothing happens. Is there a terminal command (other than lsof) than can close open ports?\nOne option which doesn't work is the \"tcpkill\" command, which apparently can close TCP ports, but it must be downloaded and I can't figure out how to download it.\nAlso, is there a Mac program that specifically closes open ports?  \nIt's really annoying that programs like Network Utility (Netstat) and Zenmap tell you what ports are open, but then don't tell you how to close them.\nAlso, is there a way to blacklist (block) a specific IP address so that it can't connect? (Can it be done in terminal?) This would be useful for ports that I probably want to keep open (such as port 80) but want to block a specific IP address from connecting to it.\nEdit: I discovered that the unusual IP address is a Tor IP address, and it only occurs when I use Tor Browser -- however, it is not associated with any of the Tor \"nodes\" I am currently using, which is weird. When I say that the IP address is \"using\" a TCP port, what I mean the following: within Netstat (and using the \"Display the state of all current socket connections\" option), in the \"Foreign Address\" column, the mysterious Tor IP address appears -- and in the (state) column, it says \"ESTABLISHED\" (meaning, an established connection). The Tor IP address appears to be using port 9999. I also occasionally see a second mysterious Tor IP address in the \"Foreign Address\" column. That entity uses \"http\" (not \"https\"), which is also weird.\nAlso, as I said earlier, the mysterious Tor IP address appears to be using a number of other ports on my computer, such as ports 80, 443, and 9998. I will use lsof to try and stop the port 9999 process.\n\nA: Ports on macos only open when a process requests to listen on that port. \nFirst order of business is to list the process tree and hope one single running process has that port open. \nsudo lsof -i:9999\n\nShould that fail, now you have a special helper process that will register non-running processes that get woken or spawned when packets come in for them. This process is launchd Think of it like a doorman that lets the system idle until a process is needed to handle something over its registered ports. \nSince your question has about five sub questions, let’s leave this small answer to a very large question and perhaps you can ask a follow up question detailing how to learn launchd and where it stores it’s configurations. That alone would be a couple times larger than your original post. As is a summary of firewall operations. Each of these depend on specific MacOS versions for the details that are relevant. \nTo summarize, you close a TCP or UDP port by identifying the process that opened it and stopping that process or changing the configuration file that tells launchd to listen as a proxy. \n", "Q: Why does my Outlook BCC myself on all outgoing emails?

I'm wondering if a prepaid SIM card that ran out of funds still in my iPad will continue to improve the devices location accuracy (by scanning nearby cell towers and apply triangulation)?\n\nA: \nWill a deactivated SIM card continue to improve location accuracy?\n\nIt doesn't matter because it's a moot point.  The cellular location services improves the performance of your location tracking by augmenting the GPS data, but it cannot improve the accuracy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Improve GPS accuracy by disabling cellular data\nIf you were just going off of the location data provided by the carrier, it would be at best \"broad stroke\" in terms of accuracy.

The Personal Hotspot on iOS 13 will stay on for long periods, when paired to Mac. (Note that the Mac -> iOS tethering has unique operating system support different to simply connecting to a wifi host.) This is when the iOS device is plugged into power. \nIn contrast, when shared over WIFI to a PC, it drops out after 3-7 minutes.  This is even when the iOS device hosting the internet connection is plugged into power. The same PC stays connected to an ADSL modem sharing over WIFI for hours.

"Q: How to merge two users in Mac OS - Catalina? I'm pretty new to Mac Os.\nAt start I've created a new user, the one that is second in the below picture.\nAfter talking to a co-worker, he told me I probably didn't configure the Mac as company's standard.\nSo, I decided to change the name to be consistent, and I found this tutorial : https://support.apple.com/el-gr/HT201548.\nAfter changing the name, and restarting my computer I  found out my files are not the same and I thought everything is erased, but it's not.\nsee the picture below :\nI would like to import all my files and configurations from the second user in the picture to the third. is it possible?\n(i.e. section 8 in the tutorial didn't go as it should of)\nThanks\n\nA: So, what I did actually was to open a 2nd user (also admin), login to the new account and from that account perform the changes.\nI changed my account name, my full name but also the home directory. When the OS saw there is no home directory with that name it created a new one.\nAt the beginning I that all of my data on my user was deleted.\nSuddenly I saw the data in home directory and connected what happened.\nI accessed the 2nd admin user, changed the name of the home directory to the old one in the pic below, and thats it.\n\n", "Q: macOS isn't using my configured dummynet I would like all UDP traffic on my localhost to have 1% packet loss, 5 ms propagation delay. I thought I could use macOS' built-in dummynet for this.\nI ran at the terminal\nsudo dnctl pipe 1 config bw 10Mbit/s delay 5 plr 0.01\necho \"dummynet out proto udp from any to any pipe 1\" | sudo pfctl -f -\n\nsudo pfctl -sa and sudo dnctl list show the expected outputs (the rule seems to have been added).\n\nDUMMYNET RULES:\ndummynet out proto udp all pipe 1\n\n00001:  10.000 Mbit/s    5 ms   50 sl.plr 0.010000 0 queues (1 buckets) droptail\n    mask: 0x00 0x00000000/0x0000 -> 0x00000000/0x0000\nNow I expect all udp traffic to be slowed.\nI am developing a UDP app, testing it on localhost between a client program and a server program. The UDP traffic is clearly not having any dropped packets even though I would like to simulate 1% dropped packets.\n\nA: By default, pf is not enabled on modern macOS. You'll need to enable it first by running this command:\nsudo pfctl -E\n\nIf you prefer a graphical interface instead of the command line interfaces for dummynet and pf, you can use Apple's \"Network Link Conditioner\" instead. \nYou can find it in the \"Additional Tools for Xcode\" package. If you have Xcode installed, it can be downloaded from within Xcode - otherwise you can download it directly from Apple's developer page (you do not actually need to have Xcode installed).\nAfter downloading, you'll find it in the Hardware folder as a preference pane you can double click to install.\nFrom the preference pane, you can enable/disable the link conditioner, choose which interface to have an effect on, and specify what you want to simulate (such as limited bandwidth, dropped packets, delays, etc).\n", "Q: How to organise overflowing config files and folders in the home directory and beyond! The Context:\nI'm a long-time macOS user who has spent many years dabbling here and there with the *nix side of Apple life since the first iteration of OS X (10.0) originally shipped. \nRecently, I find myself compelled to dig a little deeper after deciding to embark on a journey of self education in all things scripting/programming/system administration. Thankfully there exist fantastic tools such as Homebrew, amongst others, to make the management of this macOS shadow-land far more straightforward, but sometimes it's neccessary to work outside of these self-contained ecosystems. \nThe Core Problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*I find myself gathering a large quantity of configuration-related files and folders in my home directory. This unwiedly & miscellaneous collection seems sub-optimal and I'm wondering if the more experienced have some \"best practice\" guidance for this situation - maybe even a decicated utility or two? \n\n*I'm keenly aware that the ecosystem of *nix software is extremely sensitive to directory/path structure; and minor changes can have major side effects that aren't immediately obvious,resulting in increasingly time-costly troubleshooting and conflict-resolution in the future - particularly when the problem at hand isn't recent and \"fresh in the mind\".\n\n\nAny suggestions/pointers/links or path/environment variables welcome - thanks!\n\nA: These tools expect their .foorc file to reside in ~ so there is no easy way to \"organize\" this better (besides not using the -a of ls so you don't always see them :-)) unless you want to compile everything from a (appropriately) modified source yourself.\nSome tools use an environment variable to read their configuration from a custom location. This is tool-specific though, you need to consult the man page to see whether this is an option.\nSome people use git or similar tools to easily share configurations between systems (and also as a way to have access to old versions), see (among a ton of other sources) these links.\nPS: This is a rather broad answer to a broad question. If you want specific advice for a specific tool, please ask a new question including the relevant details\n", "Q: How to click and drag to select/copy only part of a message in iMessage for OS X? Can anyone tell me how to restore the feature that allows clicking and dragging in a message in the OS X Messages app to select only part of a message that has already been sent or received?\nThis capability seems to come and go. I just did it a few days ago, and now it doesn't work again. \n\nA: On a whim, I tried quitting Messages, and re-starting just the app, and it actually worked; before quitting I was unable to highlight part of a message. Afterwards, now I can select a subset of a message. I can also double-click to select a single word, etc.\n", "Q: Chess OS X Catalina Game Connected but Moves not Updating I am trying to play a Game Center Chess game on the Mac OS X Chess app with a friend who is also on OS X. \nSo far, we've been able to connect to each other to start a new game and at the top of the window it says I'm vs. Him in the game details, however , when he makes a move it doesn't update on my screen. \nIf one of us forfeits the game then the other can see they won so it updates that info.\nThe problem is our moves aren't updated as we're playing even though it says we are connected and playing against each other in the details of the window as a Game Center match. \nOther info:\nWe are friends on Game Center on iOS and Mac\n\nA: I am seeing the same thing. I have been testing this out locally with two computers and two gamecenter accounts (both on High Sierra).  I see one game that says \"Black to Move\", while the other says \"White To Move\". \nI have found one way to force an update is to go to the menu and choose Game -> Close, and then Game -> New -> GameCenter -> Start, and then it will show existing game center games, and you can choose to have your turn. Pretty annoying though.\n", "Q: Is there a lexicon for the icons on a Mac?

Before macOS Catalina it was possible to permanently change TTL by creating /etc/sysctl.conf file. It seems this is not an option anymore. After Catalina upgrade the file was moved to my desktop with the message that it is no longer compatible with macOS security settings.\nWhat would be the best way to do it now in macOS Catalina?\n\nA: The classic method with /etc/sysctl.conf still works for macOS Catalina, but only after disabling SIP since El Capitan.\n", "Q: MacOS uninstalled after installing bootcamp during windows partioning my mac's macos was uninstalled during setting up a new partition in windows, reason is windows reformatted the partitions to its format, is there a way for me to re-install macos without losing all data on windows, which by the way doesnt even have bootcamp drivers installed \nthanks!\n\nA: This question if difficult to answer, because of the lack of information. The most likely answer is to boot to macOS Recovery over the internet and install macOS.\nOther information that would have been helpful include the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*The version of macOS that was installed.\n\n*The model/year of the Mac.\n\n*The version of Windows.\n\n*The Windows boot method (BIOS or EFI).\n\n*The current entries in partition tables (GUID and MBR).\n\n*The method use to install Widnows (DVD, flash drive, Boot Camp Assistant).\n\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2013 won't boot up; Charging cable never turns green, always amber I have a 2013 MacBook Air 13\" (A1466), which all off a sudden wouldn't boot up.  The charging LED on the cable was always green.\nI then attempted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Holding the power button down 10 secs\n\n*SMC Reset \n\n*Using a charger from my Macbook Pro (which I know works)\n\n\nNo difference.  \nI then thought I would warm the Macbook Air up slightly (by  placing it in front of a blow heater).  This resurrected the Macbook Air as it started up after a few minutes.  \nHowever the next day, it wouldn't boot up again and this time even heating it up didn't work.\nSo I then ordered a replacement battery from iFixit, as it was a lot cheaper than taking it to the nearest authorised service centre for diagnostics, thinking the there was a reasonable chance that the battery was playing up (it was 7 years old, and starting to show its age anyway).\nAfter replacing the battery, the Macbook Air still won't start.  I opened everything back up, and tried to disconnect all visible cables, removed the I/O board, and put it back again, in case a cable had come loose.  There was no visible damage on the I/O board either.  All cables seemed to be OK.  \nOne thing I've observed is that the charging cable LED never changes colour - it is always amber. And there is not a hint of warmth whilst connected.  \nI'm now suspecting that there is something wrong with the I/O board.  Is there any way of diagnosing a fault with the I/O board?  Any other suggestions to look into?\n\nA: \nIs there any way of diagnosing a fault with the I/O board? Any other suggestions to look into?\n\nIt’s possible that it’s your DC In Board as you stated, however the symptom you describe indicates it may be something worse; it may be your logic board.\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook charger isn't working\n\n*MacBook Pro early 2015 not turning on and not charging\nThe amber led means that the MacBook has sensed the charger (1 wire charging circuit) and is sending power, but the battery isn’t charging. We know this because it won’t turn on and the battery never completes a charge cycle (light never goes to green)\nIt’s cheap and easy to replace the DC in board, so that’s pretty much the diagnostic.  If that doesn’t solve the issue, it’s your logic board (possibly your SMC, any of the power rails, the battery charging circuitry, etc.)\n", "Q: Can’t log into Mac due to symbols appearing instead of letters I am trying to log into my MacBook.

I realize I need to access system preferences in order to fix the keyboard, but I can’t unless I log in correctly. Please help! \n\nA: You can fix the keyboard without logging in using these methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a guest account, you can log in there and change the keyboard there.\n\n*Boot into recovery mode (cmd + R) and you should be able to change the keyboard from there. \n\n*Safe boot by holding shift as your computer restarts, and it should reset the keyboard (probably? I'm not sure about this).\n\nA: I had a similar issue and fixed it before logging in\n\n*\n\n*on the login screen on the top right you will see ABC with a tiny keyboard picture click on it\n\n\n*Select other input sources choose ABC - extended , then after selected , reselect your previous ABC keyboard selection and hit remove current selection\n\n\n*Select other input sources again and choose the original ABC this should fix your keyboard typing in symbols\n", "Q: Can you stop websites from opening apps? I have a situation where I would like to use both the app and website of a particular service.  However, when I search via safari, firefox or chrome, the website or link just opens up the app instead of the website.  \nIs there a way to stop these from opening apps?\n** for whatever reason, the website has information and data that the app does not show, hence why I want to view the site.\n\nA: The link you click on is called a Universal Link and it allows the web developer to create a link that opens the associated app automatically, even if not installed.\n\nWhen a user is browsing your website in Safari and they tap a universal link to a URL in the same domain as the current webpage, iOS respects the user’s most likely intent and opens the link in Safari. If the user taps a universal link to a URL in a different domain, iOS opens the link in your app.\n\nWhat this means is if you’re already on the Reddit site for example, if you click a link, it won’t launch the app.  However, if you click on a link from somewhere else, like a web search, it will launch the app.   This is the default behavior in iOS 9 and up.\nWhile the documentation references Safari, Chrome and Firefox both respect the universal links. \nYou can “bypass” this In Safari on a per site basis by long pressing the link then selecting “Open in Safari”. Every link after that will open in Safari.  You can reset it by long pressing the link again and selecting “open in app”. \n\nBecause Chrome and Firefox respect the link, once you set it in Safari, the other browsers will follow suit. \n", "Q: What is opt-cmd-] bound to and how can I switch this off? In my newish Mojave install on an iMac I experience some odd behaviour: \n\n⌥ Option⌘ Command] plays the alert sound even if it is bound to an action in a keyboard shortcut tool like Keyboard Maestro\n\nAnd it is only ⌥ Option⌘ Command], other key combinations which (to my knowledge) are not bound to anything. E.g ⌥ Option⌘ Command[ doesn't make any sound.\nAlso this behavior only seems to happen in one (my main) user account (other accounts - whether admin accounts or not) do not have this problem.\nI cannot attribute this to any main application or menu bar app. (And I have quite a few of them!) How did I check?: One-by-one I quit all main apps and then all menu bar apps - still ⌥ Option⌘ Command] plays the alert sound.\nHow can I find out what causes this alert tone?  How can I find out which app/tool/daemon binds to ⌥ Option⌘ Command]?\n\nNotes:\nI care about this because I usually have on ⌥ Option⌘ Command] a particular Keyboard Maestro macro running. This still works - but additionally this unexpected alert sound plays on the shortcut.

In fact, if you issue a diskutil apfs resizeContainer command, you can get a message stating this. Also, the message will state resizing can execute faster if you boot to macOS Recovery. The Boot Camp Assistant must use the same software to resize and make space for Windows, but no warning is issued with respect to time. So, I can see where a user would conclude something is wrong, when in fact it really does take that long to resize.\nRestarting the Mac, during resizing of the container where Catalina is install, probably would cause the container to be corrupted. You could try boot to macOS Recovery over the internet and then use the Disk Utility to run Fist Aid on the container.\n", "Q: How can I control my mac using only my keyboard? (e.g. macOS Catalina Voice Control with only the keyboard) Preface:\nI am a fan of accessibility overlays, especially when they can be used to reduce the usage of the mouse pointer to control you computer.\nNow with the release of macOS Catalina, I think the new \"grid overlay\" and \"numbers overlay\" should be mapped to the keyboard as well.\nImagine typing in Mail, then switching application and tabbing to the browser, and only with the keyboard, navigating the application!\nHow can I invoke macOS Catalina \"Voice Control\" features using only the keyboard?\nHow can I control my mac with keyboard only?\n\nA: On controlling mac with only keyboard, I have a couple of really lame/impractical solutions that you probably already know about. \nThere is System Preferences->Keyboard->Shortcuts. There, you can use an unfriendly ui to configure a quite few undocumented options, mapping them to keyboards strokes that only sometimes work.  If you spend enough time memorizing shortcuts, you may get somewhere with mouseless use of your Mac.\n\nThen there is System Prefs->accessibility->switch control.  Click enable switch control check box.  A black window will pop up.  Click on Pointer.  That gives you a bunch of options to simulate mouse use by pressing just space bar.  If you map turning this option to a keyboard shortcut -- BAM!  You can do anything without a mouse.  The downside is it takes like 30 seconds for every click.\n\n", "Q: Run Script Atomically I have a launchd task that runs a bash script periodically, and this works great. However, if I change the script while the task is running, either by editing it directly, or swapping it with an updated copy, it can cause the running task to spew out a load of syntax errors or worse, have unpredictable behaviour.\nThe problem appears to be that instead of loading the script into memory, or holding open the file as it was at the time of execution, launchd (or probably bash itself) is loading the live file line-by-line, this means that any changes to the script appear to be reflected in real time, leading to errors.\nTo try to illustrate the problem, consider the following:\nif [ \"$foo\" = '1' ]; then\n    do_something_that_takes_time\nfi\n\nNow, imagine the script is running at line 2 (do_something_that_takes_time) and I swap out the script, removing the if/fi block entirely. When the script moves onto line 3, it will no longer find fi, and will continue executing expecting to find a fi but never will, resulting in an eventual error (unexpected end of file). It may also end up skipping commands (that were moved up as a result of removing lines).\nOf course I can avoid this issue by unloading the launchd task, updating, then reloading it, but this isn't very convenient, especially for tasks that can take a long time to complete (as I'd prefer to let them finish, but there seems no way to do so and swap in the file at that point). Otherwise I have to add in some mechanism for prevent the task from re-launching, so I can swap in the new script at my leisure, but this seems like an unnecessary extra step when Bash should just be running the script I told it to, at the time it started.\nSo my question is this; is there some way that I can force launchd (or Bash) to execute the script only as it was when the task began? For example by fully loading it into memory before executing, or loading from an open file-handle that won't change?\nI'm posting this here because I'm not entirely sure if this is a quirk of Bash in general, or potentially Mac specific in some way. The volume I'm executing from is using APFS, so should be copy-on-write, so I wouldn't expect this behaviour to occur (as an open file handle should continue to point to the old file, ignoring any changes that are made).\n\nA: \nSo my question is this; is there some way that I can force launchd (or bash) to execute the script only as it was when the task began?\n\nNo.  It’s not a quirk of bash or launchd.  launchd loads the job (plist) into memory, not the script.  The script gets called per it’s “start” definition like RunAtLoad or CalendarInterval.\nAlso, the nuance here is when the task began.  Well, that depends on when the task was configured to be started.  Just because the job definition is loaded doesn’t mean the task has started.\nIf you define the job within the job definition using Program and ProgramArguments it can theoretically, do what you want. However, there’s no script logic; it’s just a command and it’s arguments. \nNow if your script takes time or to put it another way, it is still running, modifying it will of course cause errors.  This would be like you executing your script, then simultaneously in another bash session modifying it.  It’s going to have issues. \nlaunchd just executes the script like you would if you typed the command manually.  \n", "Q: Applescript: Get path of files copied to the clipboard I like to get the paths of files that I have copied by using CMD+c in Finder programmatically.

At work we use Microsoft teams and that will certainly work, but we pay for this. I believe Zoom will record meetings as well. Latency for close timing will certainly be a challenge - even in professionally managed WiFi and business class Internet, there is often delay that makes it hard to call and response let alone synchronize a trio. \nAs I mentioned in a clarifying comment, try to test your latency with FaceTime audio group chat over audio.

There was a way to do with with MagSafe 2 chargers.. What about USB C MacBooks?\n\nI know battery topics are a bit contentious, but hopefully people won't argue about that too much. The best charge level to keep a Li-ion battery is around 40% and I'd like to elongate my battery health when keeping my MacBook stranded on the desk for extended periods of time. I ask also just out of curiosity as this was possible with older MacBooks. I would appreciate it if no one submitted an answer explaining to me why I am wrong—if you want to do this, please view this question as a curious thought from an Mac enthusiast. \n\nA: It is possible to do this using Charge Limiter, battery, or Al Dente.\n\nA: No.  You can’t do this.\nIn fact the Mac, if needed, runs off both battery and AC (mains) to extract the most amount of performance from the machine.\nThis is all handled by the SMC and there’s nothing in the OS that gives you access to any of it.  In fact, not only is there no software access, you can’t even get the technical specifications of the chip itself from Texas Instruments (TI) nor can you purchase it from electronic suppliers - it’s “locked down” by Apple.\nAs for the battery issue, it’s been asked/answered several times already:\n\n\n*\n\n*Battery Full Alert\n\n*Should I disconnect my MacBook Pro's power cord when the battery is fully charged?\n\n*Battery - Shut down or sleep an MBP\n\n*How to preserve MacbookPro battery from degradation?\nThe link you supplied from Battery University is about storing batteries not using them.  It’s not realistic or practical to keep batteries charged at that 40% level because you’d be tethered to a power outlet all the time.\nSo, as I’ve said many times before, since the main factors that govern the lifespan of your battery are cycles and age, use your MacBook for what you bought it for and stop worrying about micromanaging the charging process.\n\nA: As far as I know, there are no available software options for stopping the battery from charging.\nSimilarly it is not possible to prevent charging (while simultaneously powering the laptop) by taping or otherwise \"blocking\" some of the pins in the cable, like it were possible for MagSafe 2.\nIf you're not a programmer and/or hardware engineer, the only practical solution I can think of is to buy a charger with a low wattage. I.e. if you normally use a MacBook Pro with a 96W charger - find a charger with a lower wattage so that it only covers your normal power consumption while using the laptop. This won't exactly prevent the laptop from ever charging the battery, but it would reduce it to a minimum.\nIf you can live with the laptop running from battery from time to time, I would suggest getting a programmable power plug (like a Phillips Hue Smart Plug or a WiFI enabled plug). Then you can create a small script or program that turn the plug off (and thus your charger), when the battery charge is at 50+% - and similar turns it on when it reaches 30% or lower.\nIf you do want to try to make a software solution, please keep in mind that many suggestion you see online point to setting an kIOPMChargeInhibitAssertion that will show up when running pmset -g assertions. However that is only useful for very old Macs - current Macs have the charging handled completely by secondary microprocessors. The main CPU and the operating system is not really involved, and thus you cannot stop the battery from charging this way.\nThis being said, the official recommendation from Apple is to keep batteries at about 50% charge level when storing them. It is not a recommendation that holds when you're actually powering the battery (the computer will completely automatically handle trickle-charging, and ensure that the battery is not in any way \"over charged\" or something like that).\n", "Q: fix: mismatch between extentref entry reference count My MacBookPro 2019 (Catalina 10.15.4) recently started to show weird issues in disk utility:\nWhen validating the internal startup disk (SSD) it fails various times with:\nmismatch between extentref entry reference count\n\nWhat can I do to fix this? Is this a serious issue?\n\nA: Is this a serious issue? Maybe...\nIt is an issue with your disk that needs to be run in an environment where the normal boot volume is not the active startup volume. Fortunately that is built into all recent Macs.\nFIRST, you have a recent backup, right? If not and you can make a backup, do so now.\nNow boot into recovery mode by holding the ⌘ Command R keys during a reboot. Eventually you will get to a screen (if memory serves...) that asks you to pick a language and then you get the recovery environment.\nGo to the (I believe) Tools menu and select Disk Utility. Now select the HD that you boot from and click on repair.\nDepending on what is wrong and how fixable it is this might take a few minutes. It also might take an hour or more. Let it do its thing. Hopefully it can repair the error.\nNote: as the OP mentioned sometimes running Disk Utility a few times will fix it on subsequent attempts. So try it again, and maybe again and again.\nIf it can't repair the error... Well normally I would advise using DiskWarrior (or other disk repair utilities) but I am not aware of any 3rd party disk repair utilities that work on APFS. Perhaps someone else in the AskDifferent community knows of one...\nIf there isn't one you basically should check your backup (make sure you have everything) and then reformat the disk and reinstall from scratch and then restore your backup. Why? Well if you have a disk error that Disk Utility can't fix and there are no 3rd party utilities then all you can do is reformat, reinstall and restore.\n\nA: I wouldn't be too concerned about this error. I got the same errors multiple times during disk check on MBP 15\" mid-2015 using Big Sur 11.5.1 even in recovery mode. After upgrading macOS to the latest version (11.5.2) the errors disappeared and Disk Utility first aid finished successfully.

This wireless radio uses 2.4 GHz spectrum as well and may interfere with BT and/or 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.\n", "Q: For Apple Watch + Cellular models, how do they manage active calls when going out of Bluetooth range from their paired iPhone? The following example assumes that we have an Apple Watch Cellular model that is connected over Bluetooth to its paired  iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*An incoming call is received by both the Apple Watch and its paired iPhone. The wearer of the Watch decides to answer the call directly on the Watch\n\n*During the call, the wearer of the Watch moves out of Bluetooth range of its paired iPhone - in this example, there are no nearby Wi-Fi networks that the Watch can connect to\nIn the above situation, how would the Watch manage the call? Does it have the capability of switching from Bluetooth to cellular for calls that are currently in progress, or would the call simply be dropped?\n\nA: More than likely it would be handled the same way a cellular phone transitions between cell towers while moving - hand off or handover. Basically while connected to one tower, it connects to another to make the transition seamless.\nNow, remember, the iWatch has an eSIM attached to it which itself is linked to the iPhone’s account.  That watch simply has to connect to the cell network as the radio signal starts to degrade and the call is handed off.  More than likely, the watch is already connected to the call because it’s directly linked to the account.\nBluetooth Profiles\nMost folks generally take \"connected via Bluetooth\" for granted that it's just \"connected\" and your iWatch likes your iPhone.  That's not the case.  When connected via Bluetooth, it must do so with a specific Bluetooth Profile, usually a headset profile because it's providing mic, earphones, hold, dial, volume up/down features.  It's acting exactly how a BT headset would work and would \"react\" the same way if it went out of range of the iPhone - it would disconnect.\nWiFi\nYou can think of the WiFi connectivity between your iPhone and you iWatch as the same as the Apple Handoff works with your iOS devices and your Mac.  For example, when Handoff is enabled and my iPhone and iMac are on the same network, I can make and receive calls on my iMac.  What's happening is I'm making a call on my iPhone through my iMac. \n\nA: It's doesn't have the capability of switching from Bluetooth to cellular for calls that are currently in progress, so the call would simply be dropped.\nWhen you answer a call on your iPhone and hand it off to the Apple Watch, the watch doesn't actually communicate with the cell network to transition the call from the iPhone's cellular connection to the watch's cellular connection. That's not how it works. This is because that is actually a pretty complicated process that takes a lot of time (i.e. you would be left without a call for several seconds).\nWhat actually happens is that the call is simply \"forwarded\" on from the iPhone to the watch using Bluetooth/WiFi (Handing off phone calls to Apple Watch, last paragraph). The call is technically still terminated on the iPhone, and thus the cellular modem on the watch is not in play. You must remain within range of your iPhone to keep the call - if you go outside range, the call is dropped. You can then dial up again from the Watch to create a new call ofcourse.\nWhen you answer a call on your Apple Watch and the call is terminated on the watch via your eSIM, you can indeed go out of range of the iPhone without any problems. However this is only the case if the iPhone was never involved in the call at all - and doesn't apply to the situation you describe, where the call was going to the Watch over Bluetooth initially.\n", "Q: Mid 2010 MacBook Battery Replacement Recommendations I'm trying to revive my old Mid-2010 MacBook. It holds a charge, but I am experiencing hardware performance issues that I believe are directly related to the aging battery (hasn't been replaced since 2013). I'm looking for an online vendor that sell OEM or similar replacement parts. I've heard good things about iFixit.\nDoes anyone have experiences they'd be willing to share, good or bad? Is there anything else I should consider replacing before the battery? \n\nA: I got the same Macbook Mid-2010 which is valuable to recover to do a lot of stuff. I would recommend you to find the trusted vendor for the battery and other parts as we might have different area. See the review online to check whether they are selling good parts or not. If your decision fall to iFixit hardware, it could not go wrong as they are trusted and reliable as well with complete instruction for you macbook as well.\nI would recommend you to learn to clean the macbook as well, buy thermal paste, change it yourself carefully which can be fun and add knowledge. In summary I would say:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean the macbook inside out and change thermal paste (buy thermal\npaste if you do not have one)\n\n*Replace HDD to SSD in your macbook (buy HDD caddy to replace your optical drive and use current HDD as extended storage)\n\n*Upgrade RAM to at least 8 GB would be better\n\n*Change battery\n\n\nThat would be the things I did and now it can be use for daily but not extreme usage.

Additional coding required to append new meta-data to existing meta-data of the same type, however, this is deemed outside the scope of the expressed use case. \n", "Q: macOS Crashing After Wakeup from Sleep I have Macbook Pro 13\" 2017 with macOS Mojave.

For example, I want to keep hiding all the .app extensions.\nHowever, it used to be that by default, when I saved a file from an application, the Finder would show that file's extensions. Maybe this was a setting I set that I forgot about, or maybe that was the default for the OS, I don't know for sure, but I do know that is the way it worked across all applications. \nNow, under Catalina, the default is to hide the file's extension. To get the extension to show, I either need to add it to the filename when saving or save it and then go to the file's Info and uncheck \"Hide extension\". \nIs there a way to make it the system-wide default to save new files with their extensions showing in macOS 10.15 Catalina?\n\nA: Like StefsterNYC, I had Show all filename extensions checked in Finder > Preferences > Advanced, and therefore could not see the Hide extension option in save windows pictured in sonderpa's answer.\n\nUnchecking Show all filename extensions in Finder > Preferences > Advanced allowed me to see and uncheck the Hide extension option in save windows.\n\nRechecking Show all filename extensions in Finder > Preferences > Advanced hides extensions (in the filename input field) and the Hide extension option in save windows again. This is a bug and should be reported to Apple (my report's Feedback ID: FB9887776).\n\nA: This was annoying me too.\nToday I found a solution.\nYou can now set save with/without extension in every application.\nAs soon as you get the Save screen you can change this and it will be saved for that application\n\n\nA: Mine was way different than this. I had to actually go into Finder Preferences > Advanced and uncheck Show all filename extensions.\nWhile I did do this, the files that were saved in different directories still showed their file extensions which is good and when saving, but the issue went away from duplicating. So that's good.\n\n", "Q: How to grant Screen Recording permission to an Automator Quick Action I've created an Automator Quick Action called \"Screenshot\" that uses the \"Run Shell Script\" action to run a script in my path, which uses Mac OS's built in screencapture command and then uploads the file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. I've done this so I can use my Screenshot script from the Touch Bar by holding Fn to see the Quick Actions menu.\nHere's the problem: when I take a screenshot while focused on an app that doesn't have Screen Recording permissions in Security and Privacy, I only get a picture of my wallpaper. Everything works fine in apps that have Screen Recording permissions, or when running it from Automator manually. \nI suspect that Automator inherits its permissions from the window in which it is running. Therefore, I would like to know how to manually grant Screen Recording permissions to my most commonly used apps, so that I can take screenshots within them. \nThere are no add/remove buttons in the Security and Privacy section, and I cannot modify the database manually because of SIP.\nOr, if there's a way to do so, I'd like to have the shell script run within the context of iTerm 2 (which does have Screen Recording permissions) instead of the context of the currently focused app.\n\nA: I have had some similar issues. My workaround was to add the Automator created app to:\nSystem Preferences → Security & Privacy → Accessibility\nThen running the app, letting the system add the programs it may control to:\nSystem Preferences → Security & Privacy → Automation\nThis might not at all be what you asked for, but I thought it seemed a bit similar.\nNote however, every time I change something in the app, I have to repeat the above steps.\n", "Q: Need help setting up a script to change date and time Mac OS Catalina hoping someone can help with this.

Here's what I have so far:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\necho \"password\" | sudo -S date 0101000120\nSo this will turn off wifi, and will pass my password (can also do it through a dialog but thats not my problem) and will set the system date...then the automator wheel just spins....\n\n\n*\n\n*Any ideas how to get the terminal script to exit and move on to the next command...or should I just run it and then quit the script as its spinning which isn't ideal but also works\n\n*command to turn on and off auto updating of mac system date and time?\n\n\nThanks so much for reading and greatly appreciate any help.\nEDIT: Currently re-wrote the automator task to run the terminal command, ask for a password then pass that on:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\npw=\"$(osascript -e 'Tell application \"System Events\" to display dialog \"Password:\" default answer \"\" with hidden answer' -e 'text returned of result' 2>/dev/null)\" && / echo \"$pw\" | sudo -S date 0101000120\nStill spins the wheel in an infinite loop at the end but I can click it and force stop. Anyone knows a way to just get it to stop appreciate it!\n\nA: I could get this to work by piping the password to sudo from a file instead of using echo: \nsudo -S date 0101000120 < ~/passwd.txt\n\nI'm not sure what security implications this has though, but it feels wrong ...\nIf you're after a quick and dirty solution then this will do it, however as per nohillside's comment, here are some instructions to run sudo commands without requiring a password. These suggestions work for me on Mojave in iTerm2 and terminal.\n", "Q: Macbook pro 2013 disable trackpad input completely I want to completely disable my trackpad, from startup if possible.\nThe trackpad on my 2013 macbook pro is not working properly anymore. Click/Tap does not register and neither alternate click. I believe the trackpad is in a \"always clicking\" state because hovering over elements that usually change their color is not triggered either. \nConnecting a mouse, even with “Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present” option enabled, is not working either, the mouse click does not register, only right click works. \nOnly way I managed to make my mouse work properly was disabling some kexts ( I dont remember which ) and then restarting the computer with the mouse plugged in already. However, after removing the mouse and plugging it back again, it stopped working.\nI don't have any possibility to go to a service due to the current situation, so I am looking for any temporary workaround that will allow me to use a mouse.\n\nA: The track pad is a USB device so the only way to disconnect it is to physically disconnect it.  However, you may have to disconnect the entire top case rendering your keyboard disconnected as well.\nIf you're having issues with the track pad, your best option is to replace it.  Disabling it by deleting kexts only lasts until the subsequent update.  With Catalina, you'll need to disable security (SIP) to delete the kexts which is counterproductive. \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro Trackpad Suddenly Stopped Working Completely\n\n*2015 13\" MacBook Pro Trackpad and Keyboard stop working\n\n*Trackpad and keyboard of MacBook Pro unresponsive\n", "Q: Displaying difference between APFS snapshots Problem\nAPFS is amazing... and infuriating with its lack of tools available.\nWhat I'm trying to do is simply an equivalent of btrfs send --no-data -p /snapshots/parent /snapshots/child\nMy investigation\n\n\n*\n\n*Most of the google-fu returns usages of tmutil\n\n\n*\n\n*tmutil is able to listlocalsnapshots / deletelocalsnapshots / localsnapshot (create)\n\n*tmutil compare <snapshot_path> doesn't accept 2 snapshots\n\n*tmutil compare EXISTING_SNAPSHOT returns cryptic & undocumented Must specify a snapshot root when performing a machine comparison.\n\n*tmutil calculatedrift <machine_directory> doesn't seem to be related to APFS snapshots\n\n*tmutil contains some undocumented options, but nothing related to snapshots\n\n*Snapshot created by tmutil have hardcoded com.apple.TimeMachine.YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.local naming format\n\n\n*diskutil contains limited snapshots support\n\n\n*\n\n*diskutil deleteSnapshot works as intended\n\n*diskutil listSnapshots list snapshots with sizes and some metadata (unlike tmutil)\n\n*No facility for creating snapshots\n\n\n*Kernel contains fs_snapshot_* syscalls\n\n\n*\n\n*The documentation is almost non-existent, but a single man page is available \n\n*All usual operations (fs_snapshot_delete / fs_snapshot_list / fs_snapshot_create / fs_snapshot_mount) are supported\n\n*GitHub ahl/apfs hosts a small utility which demonstrates the syscalls usage\n\n*fs_snapshot_list list only com.apple.TimeMachine.* snapshots\n\n*Any write operations (e.g. fs_snapshot_create) end up with application being killed with fs_snapshot_create: Operation not permitted (probably due to documented in the man reason: \"require an additional entitlement\")\n\n\n*Commercial app, Carbon Copy Cloner, is able to manipulate snapshots\n\n\n*\n\n*For obvious reasons they don't disclose how they do that ;)\n\n\n\nHelp? ;)\nIs there any method of getting a diff between two snapshots? Any documentation how they can be managed?\nThe only naïve approach which because of speed is not feasible is running rsync between r/o mounted snapshots... but this is just stupid. \n\nA: There's no tool available for APFS similar to what you see with btrfs send. The state of APFS is still relatively \"early days\" when it comes to tools like that. On btrfs it took 3-4 years before they had the btrfs send tool in ordinary Linux - I wouldn't expect Apple to be able to push something out faster than that.\nThe btrfs tool is very elegant in that it relatively efficiently provides a list of simple commands (such as unlink, rename, write) to transform an existing snapshot (on both the source and destination) into another snapshot that exists on the source, but not yet on the destination.\nWith APFS you haven't got such a tool to efficiently create the list of diff commands. However, you can use any tool that synchronizes two ordinary folders over a network. It won't be as efficient in generating the list of diffs, but it should be possible to make it just as efficient in applying the diffs (as the btrfs receive command is implemented in user-space). \nA well known tool for that purpose is rsync, but you've already mentioned that you do not want to run rsync because of the speed. Unfortunately there's really no methods speedier - unless you happen to have some kind of special use case where you can make assumptions about the changes between your snapshots.\nRegarding Carbon Copy Cloner and the entitlements - I don't think it's a \"secret\" as such how they work with snapshots. You've found the various system calls for snapshot manipulation (which they use), and you can read the the actual on-disk format specification on Apple's web page. You could use dtrace to inspect the actual system call parameters and order of them that CCC uses.\nThe sad part is that creating your own programs that do something with snapshots (besides listing them), requires the entitlement \"com.apple.private.vfs.snapshot\". You can get that entitlement only by talking to Apple's technical support for developers. If you're creating backup software for example, you should fit the criteria for getting it - but the only real way to find out is to contact Apple.\n", "Q: pf: Dynamically add rule to nat-anchor I connect to a Cisco VPN Server and want to share that connection via wifi. \nUsing the macOS Internet Sharing feature, I can only select one interface to share - either my LAN adapter, or the VPN connection. Clients on the wifi can then only connect to either the iNet, or the VPN.\nThe VPN Server is only creating a split-tunnel connection - and switching to full tunnel is unfortunately not an option.\nSetting my nat rules directly in /etc/pf.conf/ works fine and solves my problem to a degree.\nI want to script and dynamically add them using a nat-anchor. Setting the anchor with load for an external config works, however \nwhen I define my anchor in pf.conf and try to populate my rules using pfctl like so:\necho \"                                                                                                                                      \nnat on en8 from bridge100:network to any -> (en8)\nnat on utun1 from bridge100:network to any -> (utun1)\" | pfctl -a my.anchor -f -\n\nor as a one-liner:\necho -e \"nat on en8 from bridge100:network to any -> (en8)\\nnat on utun1 from bridge100:network to any -> (utun1)\\n\" | pfctl -a my.anchor  -f -\n\n(w/ or w/o the trailing \\n)\nI can confirm that the rules are set on my anchor using \npfctl -sn -a my.anchor but the actual routing remains unchanged.\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\nA: This sounds like the top-level rules (the ones with empty anchor) do not have a reference to your nat-anchor. You need to make sure there is a nat rule with a \"nat-anchor \" in the TOP level rules linking to your anchor.\nIn general, for any rules to apply, you should be able to trace \"nat-anchor\" (or \"WHATEVER-anchor\") inclusion rules from the top level all the way to your anchor's config.\nYou can use 'pfctl -sn' to see the top-level nat rules. Should see a line like this:\nnat-anchor \"myanchor\" all\n\nFor those with more deeply nested anchors, you can dump everything for all anchors using this script. The recursive printing mentioned in the man page has a bug and does not work (prints some stuff and 'DIOCGETRULES').\nAnyway, just make sure each anchor from root to your rules has a nat-anchor directive, and it's either explicit, or if there are wildcard *s in the anchor string (was just \"myanchor\" here), then there is some intermediate or final anchor that matches the wildcard (wildcards match one level only).\nRelated answer here: pfctl - howto add an anchor and make it active / load it\n\nA: I think you need to call sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 to enable packet forwarding.\nYou don't need to modify /etc/pf.conf.\nIt should be sufficient, if you change -a my.anchor to -a 'com.apple/my.anchor'.\n", "Q: Is it normal for a MacBook Pro to run so hot? I have a new MacBook Pro 16\" and I've noticed the physical temperature between the touch bar and the screen is really hot to the touch and with a thermal gun measures 105 degrees F.  The same location underneath is also just as hot.  Reading the internal sensors the temp hovers around 150 Deg F and when the system is in control of the fans they appear to be barely running.  When I override them and speed the fans up things will cool down but that seems a bit strange that the system control to allow the internals to get that hot.\nI've tried doing an SMC reset and that didn't help.  It also doesn't matter if I'm charging it or not it will still run as hot.  I have it sitting on the top of my desk with a lot of space around it for good circulation.\nIf I'm doing non-cpu or non-gpu intensive operations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should the temperature be that high if all of the airflow systems are working correctly?\n\n*If the components would normally generate that amount of heat shouldn't the fans speed up without having to be forced to?\n\n\n\n\nA: See here for info on how to get the specifics for your processor.\n150F is an OK temperature for the processor to be running at. Here's a nice guide on everything you need to know about intel temperatures. \nSystem control for the fans generally tries to balance the need for the fans with the noise made by the machine, meaning the fans are left off for as long as possible. But the designers know the thermal limitations of the CPU and have measures in place in software to protect it against thermal damage, so you shouldn't be worried about it.\n\nA: A CPU is fine to be running at about 60c which is 140f so you don't have anything to worry about. I would advise not letting it get much higher than 65c though to ensure longevity. \nMy MacBook Air runs constantly at between 50 - 60c and my 2011 iMac is usually at 45c but when gaming will get all the way up to 63c (but this has 3 fans in it)\nWhat year is the MacBook? If particularly old it might be worth replacing thermal paste on the CPU\nAnother tool that is good for temp readings and fan control if you are worries is Macs Fan Control. It is free and I really like it. \n", "Q: Liquid keyboard damage on MB Air - password keys don’t work even with USB keyboard A friend decided to disinfect the keyboard of another friend’s MacBook Air. Some of the keys in her password no longer work, specifically M and P.\nThe weird thing is, we tried a USB keyboard and those keys also don’t work with the external keyboard - typing M and P get no input.\nWe also tried the Dvorak layout. The “broken” physical keys work, but the keys that are mapped to M and P then don’t work.\nWhen I log in as a Guest User, the USB keyboard works completely, but that doesn’t help much.\nIt seems like some kind of software keyboard module got fried? I can’t think of a good explanation.\nCurrently we can not log in to the computer at all.\nCan anyone help us, or at least give some guidance on how we can back up the computer?\n\nA: Physical damage simply cannot “fry” software; it’s impossible.  The most likely cause is that something is shorted in the MacBook keyboard and it’s conflicting with the same signals being sent by the USB keyboard.\nDisconnect the keyboard from the logic board and then use use the USB keyboard to login.  While it will get you up and running, it’s not a permanent fix.  The top case will have to be replaced.\nSee Keyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix for more details\n", "Q: Login user - opposite to launchctl bootout user/id How can I login user in programmatically way?\nI need something opposite to command \n\nlaunchctl bootout user/502\n\nthat logouts user with id=502.\nDoes this way exist?\n\nA: Not on macOS\nNo, there is no Apple supported programmatic way of logging in a user on macOS.\nOne approach would be to create a virtual smart card and simulate a user logging in. This would require significant effort and development time.\n", "Q: How to display full path to file in spotlight search? I often use SpotLight to find files in macOS Mojave. \nHowever, many times there are multiple files with the same name.  Is there a way to display the full path for each file in the spotlight window where the found files are listed? \n\nA: When Spotlight is selected from the Menu Bar, the window does not show the full path, as shown below.\n\nHowever, if you select Show all in Finder..., then the full path is shown in the Path Bar at the bottom of the Finder window. In the image below, the full path is shown as ~/Desktop/Dave.txt. If there is not enough room to display the full path, then the full path can be read by placing the mouse over the text. Also, any part of the path (including the full path) can be dragged and dropped into a text window.\n\nIf you need to preview a document in the Finder window, the highlight the file and press Cmd-I, as shown below.\n\nWhen Spotlight is not being used, the Path Bar in the Finder window can be toggled between hide and shown by pressing Opt-Cmd-P. You can also select Hide Path Bar or Show Path Bar under View in the Menu Bar.\n\nA: If you want to view the path to the file directly in the spotlight search you can simply hold down cmd ⌘:\nWithout cmd ⌘:\n\nWith cmd ⌘:\n\n\nA: By default, macOS includes a shortcut to invoke \"Finder search results\": option-command-Spacebar.  This is simply a different view from Spotlight's same index.\nTo customize the shortcut, open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, select Spotlight and click once on the entry to the right of the option.  (For example, you could disable the typical Spotlight results, then update the Finder results with the original command-Spacebar shortcut.)\n\nA: Wanted to elaborate on @compuphys that now you can even open the file in finder by pressing cmd ⌘Return ↵.\n", "Q: How to let screenshot show a mouse pointer on Mojave and Catalina? I think in Mojave and up, we can press CMD Shift 5 to show a menu of what to capture on screen and the Options.\nThere are options for a 5 second or 10 second timer, and one to \"Show Mouse Pointer\".  But if I use a 10 second timer and \"Show Mouse Pointer\", the mouse pointer is not in the screenshot? (The one I tried was to get a region of the screen). How to make it work?\nP.S. I experimented some more. If I do a full screen capture, the mouse pointer was there. But if it is a window or region capture, then the mouse pointer wasn't there.\n\nA: Screenshot under Catalina does not have this problem, went taking timed full screen captures. If only a selected portion or window is needed, then take a screenshot of a selected portion of the full screen image. This can result in a monotonous and time consuming process. However, the Screenshot application includes a record feature, that can be used when many screen captures are needed. You can then playback, pause and capture whole screens, windows or portions. Below is one example.\n\nExample of the Wrong and Right Way to Capture a Window.\nThe images below were taken using the Grab application from High Sierra.\nGrab was used to capture a Finder window. The image is shown below. The problem here is the window does not have focus.\n\nNext, Grap was used to capture a selection which included the Finder window, as shown below. Still no focus.\n\nFinally, a timed capture was taken of the entire screen. The the delay was used to give focus to the Finder window. Next, a selection was captured from this image. The result was the correct image shown below.\n\nBelow is an example where the Screenshot application was is used from Catalina.\nFirst, a two captures of a Finder window were taken, as shown below. The first image was taken without a timer. The second was taken with a 5 second timer, so focus could be given to the window. In both cases, neither window has focus.\n\n\nNext, a capture of a selected portion was taken, which included the window, as shown below. Here the image is correct. So at least Apple has fixed one problem.\n\nFinally, two captures were taken. The first involved the timed full screen, then a portion of the first image. The second image is shown below. You can see this image is also correct.\n\nBelow is an example where the Screenshot application is used from Catalina. This time a screen pointer is included\nBelow is a selected portion taken with a timer. The screen pointer is not included.\n\nAgain, two captures were taken. The first involved the timed full screen, then a portion of the first image. The second image is shown below. You can see the image below includes the screen pointer.\n\nConclusions\nThe capture portion of Screenshot works for images which do not require inclusion of the screen pointer. When the screen pointer needs to be included, you may still need to resort to the two image approach that Grab required.\n", "Q: Diagnosing Kernel Panic \"IONVMeFamily\" My 15\" Macbook Pro (mid-2015) starts to thrash despite plenty of disk space after sleeping until it becomes unusably slow with a lagging mouse pointer.

would get stats - can you figure out how to trigger this? How long does it take to get 10 panics?\nThen pull all third party KEXT and wait the time it would have panicked 10 times. You’ll have a pretty good idea if it’s hardware or software at that point.\nSince you’re likely out of warranty, getting Apple to analyze this will be challenging. Memory can cause panics anywhere, but since you’re seeing storage specific, I’d consider swapping that or upgrading if you can’t get diagnostics run from Apple directly or AASP.\ntldr - you can spend effort to symbolicate / trace exactly what happened here, but sometimes doing a little process of elimination and logging / looking at the frequency of panics can get you the same answer with much less time invested.\n", "Q: Will Apple Music 3 month trial carry over if changing plans?

Scientific papers always have a list of references at the back, and when reading them it's often necessary to check a reference, which means taking a quick look at the list at the end of the paper, and then returning to where I was reading before. Sometimes these pdfs include hyperlinks to the references, but often they don't.\nI would like to know if there are any pdf readers available for OS X that have features designed to make this task easy, of quickly navigating to the end of the document and quickly navigating back to exactly where I left off.\nI'm not sure exactly what such a feature would be like - I don't want to constrain the question too much in case there's a way of doing it that I haven't thought of - but what I'm imagining is simply that I can have two 'views' into the pdf and a keyboard shortcut to switch between them. Clicking a hyperlink would open it in the other view, so that the keypress would bring you back to where you were. In case there aren't any hyperlinks, I could just keep one view at the reference list and the other one on the page I'm reading, and I could just switch between them as needed.\nI've tried using the split-screen feature in Skim, which is better than nothing, but it's still slightly awkward for me. I have quite poor eyesight and tend to read zoomed in quite far, which means I have to keep resizing the lower panel in order to have enough space to read the main text. I also couldn't find a way to open hyperlinks in the other panel, which means I have to scroll around to find references manually, even if the document I'm reading has hyperlinks.\n\nA: This is not a split screen solution, but an easy keyboard shortcut to switch between end and current view.\nPreview\nIn Preview you can jump back and forward in your \"viewing history\" with cmd+[ and cmd+]. After switching to the references at the end with end (or fn+→), you can jump back at the exact same view you were before with cmd+[.\nAlso remember the page number that is seen in Title bar of Preview and use alt + cmd + G to navigate. \nAcrobat Reader\nIn Acrobat you can do the same and navigate through the page history with cmd+← and cmd+→.\n\nA: Make a copy of the page(s) of the references into a second pdf.\nThen have both open, at the magnification you want.\n", "Q: Is there any more technical information about the iPad/iPhone charge management feature? According to Apple, a new \"charge management\" feature which reduces the maximum capacity of an iPhone or iPad device when it is plugged in for prolonged periods of time. This was quite interesting to me, but it did not include any detail at all. Is there any more technical information about this, such as how long it takes of being plugged in for this feature to be enabled, or the maximum charge capacity that it is limited to when this happens? \n\nA: It’s explained right below the option in settings by Apple: “To reduce battery agin, iPhone learns from your daily charging routine so it can wait to finish charging past 80% until you need to use it.”\nIt works best when you have a set schedule for yourself, as when you are unpredictable, it tends to just charge at 100% all the time.\nCharging to 80% prolongs the life of lithium-ion batteries by nearly double as charging to 80% uses 50% of a life-cycle and charging the remains 20% (the slowest part of charging) uses the remaining 50% of the life-cycle.\nApple goes more into depth in their “Batteries: Why Lithium Ion” page\n", "Q: Prevent mac from requiring login screen at home I would like to prevent my mac from sleeping when I'm at home.

I am not sure how there can be two, but neither appears to be a directory (folder). This may prevent the creation of a EFI folder which could prevent the installation of any UEFI booting operation systems which use the EFI partition to boot.\nI suppose since the volume seems to be corrupted, I would just reformat the the volume. The commands are given below. The first command can be skipped, if the volume is not mounted.\ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk0s1\nsudo newfs_msdos -F 32 -v EFI /dev/rdisk0s1\n\nOf course, you should backup all important data before reformatting.\n", "Q: Will an iphone user still receive texts from a non-smart phone user if the iphone user has \"send from sms\" turned off?

I just upgraded my 2018 15\" MacBook Pro from Mojave to Catalina (10.15.4). It's been a few hours. \nOne of the first things I did after the upgrade was edit a video using the new free trial of Final Cut Pro X. My laptop's cooling fans ran full-speed the entire time, but there was always background rendering going on, so I figured that was normal. \nWhen I finished and quit FCP, the fans didn't spin down, so I checked Activity Monitor and discovered that mDNSResponder is taking 90-100% CPU continuously. The Threads column in Activity Monitor indicates 3-4 threads most of the time; the 100% is spread across all of those, and they're not all on the same core. I'm not sure how it's managing to do that and still sit at or just under 100% most of the time, but that's what it's doing.\n\nThe laptop has six cores (12 logical), so having one core fully occupied does not make a noticeable difference in performance (unless I start measuring how long things take -- but that's noticing that the numbers are different — not that the performance is different!).\nNote: In the aggregate, the bar graphs show more than one full core being utilized. This is expected. I have a search applied in my Activity Monitor screenshot, and there's lots of other stuff going on -- Slack is open, Chrome with eleventybillion tabs, IntelliJ IDEA is probably indexing something, and so on. \nI tried rebooting mDNSResponder using these commands:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n\nI watched the process disappear, so I know the command worked, but it immediately returned to 100% CPU usage when I started it back up. mDNSResponderHelper did not stop, so I tried again, inserting sudo killall mDNSResponderHelper as an intermediate step. This made both processes go away as I intended, but still didn't fix the problem.\nI also tried sending a HUP signal to mDNSResponder as follows:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nThis also had no effect.\nI opened up Console, entered mdnsresponder in the search field, and watched the messages flow by for a minute or two. Some stuff about Bonjour, LOTS of <private>, and some pretty normal-looking DNS query logging. I tried disabling both Bluetooth and Wifi in hopes of affecting Bonjour, but I'm on a hardwired Ethernet connection (which I did not disconnect) and it did not seem to have any effect.\nAfter typing this, I eventually noticed that cloudphotosd was also taking up a healthy chunk of CPU. I assumed that this was the notorious reindexing process that frequently happens after OS upgrades, going through my (quite large) photo library, updating metadata based on whatever new features came with Catalina, and uploading those changes to iCloud. That would explain some constant network activity, and so I thought maybe that would explain mDNSResponder's activity. So I left this window open without submitting and waited a while to see if cloudphotosd would calm down. It did, but mDNSResponder did not. So much for that hunch!\nFinally, I tried rebooting my Mac; mDNSResponder wasted no time getting back to business. With no apps running after a fresh boot, it was already consistently sitting at or just under 100%, just like before.\nThis is a Q&A site, and I haven't asked a question, so here goes: how do I figure out what it is doing, and how do I make it stop?\nUPDATE: it's been nearly 48 hours and it's still churning away. My battery life sucks now. I've observed that closing the laptop lid does seem to make it stop, but it comes right back when I open it again. I've also noticed an additional symptom: first-time DNS lookups after a reboot take ~2 seconds (I'd expect <200ms). I'm not sure if that's simply a side effect of mDNSResponder being so busy doing whatever it's doing or if it is related to the cause.\nUPDATE 2: it's been more than three weeks. I've added a 100-rep bounty. The DNS lookup delay has increased; it often takes 20-30 seconds, and while there does seem to be some caching in place, I think it has a time-based expiry on it, because the delay reoccurs later without a restart. I'm happy to interact directly with someone knowledgeable enough to debug and diagnose this issue. I'm on Eastern Daylight Time in the United States (UTC-4) and generally available during business hours. \n\nA: Here's my recommendation:\n\n*\n\n*Let's see what mDNSResponder is actually doing. Here's a utility to turn off/on censorship behind the <private>label. Make sure to turn it back on once you're done. You may find something like the process is hung up on something and just loops continually, or something like that.\nhttps://georgegarside.com/blog/macos/sierra-console-private/\n\n\n*Get a packet capture of your network as you make a DNS request. Grab Wireshark, start a capture on the interface you're using (be it ethernet or WiFi; but make sure the one(s) you're not using are off/unplugged). I would do this first in the environment where it takes 20-30s, and then again after a reboot when the conditions are such that it only takes 2-3s. The less you can have using the network the better as you run these packet captures, as they'll get big fast.\nThis should show us the DNS request as well as requests to and from the websites themselves, so we can see where the delays are. If there aren't delays in the network, then we'd look at processes instead.\n\n\n*Upload relevant parts of the logs and/or the packet capture(s) somewhere for us to look at. Make sure you censor or remove any private data.\n\n\n*And, finally, note that this may be solved faster by doing an in-place OS reinstall. That may oppose your views on being able to fix your equipment, knowing what goes on with your equipment, etc., but if the goal is to get mDNSResolver back to sanity as quickly as possible, an in-place OS reinstall may be the quickest way there.\nEDIT:\nI was able to re-create the issue and capture the related network traffic.\nMany section of RFC 6762 (Multicast DNS) seem relevant - I won't post excerpts here, but specifically I found parts of sections 3, 5, 5.2 and 10.2, to be highly relevant.\nHere's what I think is happening.\nUpon creating these lo0 aliases, traffic is constantly generated with a \"cache flush\" flag. The RFC doesn't get into enough detail about it for me to be sure, but it seems like each of the loopback addresses are advertising themselves as being the address that can respond to queries made to the hostname of the machine, and therefore listening devices should flush their internal caches and update them with the new IP address.\nThink about it, if the network thinks you're hostname.local at 192.168.44.111 and your IP address changes, mDNS will blast out a \"flush your caches, hostname.local is now 192.168.44.123!\" message on 224.0.0.251. This is one circumstance where mDNS will proactively advertise a new IP, and it's the reason network browsing works so well - i.e., networked printers as per the RFC.\nWhat doesn't make a ton of sense to me, is there are parts of the RFC that have me think multiple active loopback addresses on the same machine wouldn't be spamming the way they are - but then I may not be understanding the RFC well. Either way, it seems clear to me that the mDNSResponder process is looping through each loopback interface and telling everyone on 224.0.0.251 to disregard the last guy who took charge, this is the new IP address assigned to my hostname!\nI'm not exactly clear on why this slows down regular DNS queries, except if mDNSResponder is responsible for sending out and receiving the regular DNS queries, well, it's tied up in all this nonsense with the other interfaces. And/or, perhaps the DNS queries would go out and come back in on whichever interface has most recently taken charge of the hostname. That, I could see really causing delays, because in the time a DNS request over WAN comes back, the responding loopback interface would be different than the one it went out from.

If we start sourcing .bash_profile bad things will start to happen. Instead, you should copy those ENV vars to the .zshrc file, preferably at the end of it.\n\nApparently you have to put everything into .zshrc instead of .bash_profile after this update.

I have macOS High Sierra.\n\nA: One way is to modify the install.sh script in homebrew git source and change HOMEBREW_PREFIX to point to whereever you want homebrew to install.\nIn my case, I've decided to use /usr/local2, because of some restrictions on /usr/local in OSX Catalina, so modify install.sh with HOMEBREW_PREFIX=/usr/local2 and HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY=/usr/local2/Homebrew before running ./install.sh.\nTwo problems you have to watch:\n\n*\n\n*Some packages insist on installing in /usr/local unless you manually hunt down and modify the source (not trivial)\n\n*Installing in a directory that already has similar/equal files can overwrite them and render your system unstable. Especially /usr, where a lot of system commands exist there, which you never want to replace at all.\n\n\nA: This is a bad idea if your goal is to be productive and use that tool as designed and documented. But you can learn a ton by disabling SIP on a test machine and seeing what breaks when you modify the tool. If your goal is to learn, go for it. Here is why it’s likely “non-optimal” or “extra work” to force your modifications into /usr and some very good resources on the history of where to add customizations on unix.\nApple protects /usr via system integrity protection and the closest place to / that’s encouraged to write files is /usr/local\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899\nDebates about package managers (and the people that write and spend a lot of time using them) can be passionate (and sometimes prickly). Where to store Unix or command line files can be as opinionated in terms of preference as those debating text editors like [ed|sed|vi|emacs|nano|pico] as compared to newer programming editors with more graphical features. Choosing for what you intend to optimize and how you prefer to learn and work is a highly personal choice and not something that is strictly right or wrong.\n\n*\n\n*What is standard for OS X filesystem? e.g. /opt/ vs. /usr/\n\n*Has Unix directory usage or policy changed in High Sierra?\n\n*Where should I install new (source code) software on a Mac?\nThis answer particularly has some good thinking and clear discussion as well as the above questions.  There would have to be a very compelling basis to diverge from the standard for homebrew even if you didn’t but heads with Apple on SIP in the process (which is what happens in /usr).\nWith the introduction of ARM and Intel tooling to Homebrew, the defaults are now /opt/homebrew and usr/local for brewing.\n", "Q: How to put animated gif or 'giffy' in imessage?

You could open a case with support to confirm, but the place to get these is from local backups. iCloud isn’t a backup just like files on your devices aren’t a backup. \nSo sorry if this wasn’t your expected answer.

I want to be able to keep my current older version of Safari UNTOUCHED and the newest version of Safari both installed and usable on my Mac computer. Is this possible?\n\nA: Updates to Safari tend to include updates to the WebKit system framework on which Safari relies. (The WebKit framework is separate from the app, and is then available to other apps.)\nExecuting an app that was built for a different framework from the last one you installed is likely to cause problems. \n\nA: No, it is probably not possible because Safari is a part of macOS.

The bug has STILL NOT been fixed on macOS Mojave 10.4.6. On cold reboot \"Your system was restarted because of a problem\" message still shows up. No status update on Apple Bug Report. I am kind of surprise on how Apple seems to ignore Mac mini users. They messed up the T2 chip BridgeOS and simply don't care. I guess this bug will never be fixed. Users should rather invest in a new Mac mini model with their latests Apple processor. I am not willing to spent more money on any Mac mini.\nUpdate May 28, 2020: Apple released Security Update 2020-003. However the bug has NOT been fixed on macOS Mojave 10.4.6. On cold reboot \"Your system was restarted because of a problem\" message still shows up.\nNo status update on Apple Bug Report. Mac Mini users do not seem be relevant for Apple. Such a disappointment.\nUpdate April 24, 2020: Workaround: Do not use Safari until Apple fixes the bug. Also make sure to set the default browser to Firefox, Chrome, Brave... which prevents opening Safari by accident. The shutdown message no longer shows upon a cold boot.\nUpdate April 11, 2020: I did some further testing regarding my initial issue. I have restored from a previous system backup using SuperDuper. This backup clone does NOT include the Security Update 2020-002 Mojave and Safari 13.1. Surprisingly the shutdown message still shows up sporadically when I power on the Mac mini. I have completely shut down my Mac mini 2018 around 10 times. I have waited 5-10 minutes. 4 of 10 times the crash report showed up. It's really difficult to debug. What's interesting is the macOS Mojave Software Update does not show the Security Update 2020-002. So it seems to be already applied. I guess it is definitely related to the T2 BridgeOS Update or other firmware settings which have been patched during the Security Update 2020-002. Restoring from a 4 weeks old system backup does not resolved my issue.\nThis is a really bummer. I wish Apple would spend more time on testing. So far I haven't heard back from my Apple Bug Report #FB7646566.\nUpdate April 2, 2020: I did a clean install macOS Mojave 10.14.6 without the Security Update 2020-002.

Odd thing is, I first ran the update on a Mac OS that was booted  from my external SSD (which I occasionally boot from for music production) and after I did this I also got the error after booting from my internal SSD, which had not yet been updated. So I don't know what this install did to the T2 chip but it's apparently regardless of wether you're running on internal or external SSD, and it seems to have affected the hardware rather than the Mac OS installation. \n\nA: In my case security update #3 fixed this issue. Can't reproduce it by opening Safari or putting the Mac to sleep. After a clean shutdown and startup the error shows. So no fix indeed. Shabby.\n\nCan't comment, so just wanted to state that the workaround from @howdytom works (update April 24, 2020).\nI'm going to use Chromium (brew cask install chromium) until a Safari update comes and fixes the issue.\n\nSame here. Macmini8,1 since Security Update 2020-002 (Mojave).\nIn my case the first thing that happened was that I had no screen signal, the update \"broke\" the thunderbolt port where the screen is connected. The port came to life again after manually resetting the NVRAM.\nAfter that, every time my Mac goes into a deep sleep it restarts. Not sure if it's when it goes to sleep or at the moment I wake it up. That is very annoying and critical since any work I have opened gets lost. After reading this thread tested that a shutdown results in the same error and report.\nI'm reading carefully this how-to, although I only have this Mac right now so I can't try. I suppose downgrading as @howdytom did to 10.14.6 (18G3020) from late January and do not apply the #2 security update is the only workaround right now.\nI've already filled a report using the Feedback Assistant on March 31. No reply yet, as expected. I'll update the report with this thread link. Please report it to Apple too, the more we are the faster they'll fix that.

When you reboot back into Mojave you do no longer experience the error message on cold reboot. After 7 months Apple finally fixed the issue. Apple never replied on any of my Bug Reports.\nNote: Installing Security Update 2020-006 on macOS Mojave 10.4.6 does not fix the Kernel panic bug_type 210.

It would be nice to know exactly what's going on there, but for now this has solved my problem.\n\nA: Make sure that the EFI partition isn't damaged. Go to Disk Utility and try running First Aid on the SSD (Usually Disk 0), run First Aid on the Container Disk (If formatted APFS), run First Aid on your Macintosh HD Disk. If the disk was encrypted then first find the disk identifier then go to Terminal, type    diskutil apfs listusers <disk identifier>. Then find a user that you know the password to and copy the Cryptographic UUID. Next, type    diskutil apfs decryptvolume <disk identifier> -user <Cryptographic UUID>. This should decrypt the disk.

It will wait about 30 minutes, to avoid conflicts with other things that may run automatically, or manually by the user, after startup.  \n\n*Delay (with a default of one hour): When your Mac wakes from sleep, it will do a backup immediately, unless one was done within the previous hour. That will reset the schedule.\n\n*Interval (with a default of one hour): TM will start the next backup an hour after the start of the previous backup, if your Mac is awake and the backup drive is available.\n\n", "Q: Can I create 2 \"displays\" on a headless server? I have 2 Mac Minis.  One is to be used as a headless server while the other is a general-purpose user desktop machine.  The user system has two monitors.  I have set up the server to allow screen sharing, which works fine to show its one display on one user monitor.\nThe question is whether there is a way to tell the server that it should pretend to have two displays (instead of pretending to have one) and allow those to show on corresponding user monitors. \n\nA: No, only one screen can be viewed at a time over Screen Sharing. However, if you have configured two screens, you can view each screen, one at a time, by selecting \"Displays\" from the \"View\" menu item in the screen sharing app on your User Mac.  This way you can switch which screen to view.\n\nA: Not without additional hardware. You will need at least an adaptor to create the second monitor port. Also, you would need to plug a dummy display emulator into the adaptor and another dummy display emulator into the HDMI port on the 2018 Mac mini.\nThe user can use to two monitors, each with a screen sharing window, but to do this the user has to open the Screen Sharing application once for each window. \n", "Q: only 8GB diskspace, iCloud keeps downloading iCloud stuff!!! help! \n*\n\n*Macbook: 128GB - 8GB free \n\n*iCloud: 200GB - 160GB free\n\n\nI have a very frustrating problem. I have a 128GB Macbook so you can imagine how space is an issue. I bought 200GB iCloud storage thinking that would copy non-essential stuff to iCloud and free up space. I have PLENTY of iCloud storage left but it is no comfort because it does nothing to keep my MacBook free. It seems to keep about 8GB free.. which isn't quite enough to even download a new Xcode version. \nI nearly bricked my MacBook by downloading a Mac osX update and it getting stuck half way through with \"low disk space\" issues. \nSearching for large files shows these \"iCloud Synchronization files\" on my hard drive taking up valuable space!! But I can't unsync them and keep the file in the cloud. It appears I have no control over whats synced.\nIs there a setting somewhere that says \"try keep xGB free\"? Or is there at least an \"unsync\" command on a synced iCloud file?\n\nA: The answer for me is to turn OFF the Optimize setting (see image). It seemingly stopped filling up the harddrive after I changed that setting. \n\n", "Q: How to remove Macintosh HD from desktop?

Is it possible to elevate the process so that it can't be killed by any means, including by using sudo kill <process ID> from a terminal?\n\nA: On macOS it is not possible to create processes which can‘t be killed by a user who is able to sudo. So the short and simple answer to your question is NO.\n", "Q: Does \"Erase all content and settings\" help with potential Data partition file system issues? Recently I have become concerned about the fact that there is no way of checking the filesystem integrity on the iOS platform short of rooting the device and running a manual fsck. If I were to handle some files that are important for me using my iPad (5th Gen, currently running iPadOS 13.4), I would like to make sure that the underlying filesystem is in clean state before doing any file operations. And because currently there is no macOS Disk Utility equivalent for checking the partition for errors on iOS/iPadOS, I figured that the next best way to make sure that the filesystem is clean is to wipe my user data and start from scratch.\nWould \"Erase all content and settings\" be enough to rebuild the Data partition filesystem and solve potential issues, or would I need to reinstall fresh system image using iTunes recovery for this task?\nI am having a hard time understanding what \"Erase all content and settings\" does under the hood. Reading the Apple Platform Security doc I understand that what it does is purge the user data encryption key, rendering the data unrecoverable:\n\nWhen stored, the encrypted file system key is additionally wrapped by an “effaceable key” stored in Effaceable Storage. This key doesnʼt\n  provide additional confidentiality of data. Instead, itʼs designed to\n  be quickly erased on demand (by the user with the “Erase All Content\n  and Settings” option). Erasing the key in this manner renders all\n  files cryptographically inaccessible.\n  Source: https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf\n\nDoes this mean that the filesystem on Data partition in itself is untouched by this process short of removing the encryption keys, i.e. the user data is left on the partition but unaccessible after wipe? Or does it also do a quick format of the user partition, thus rebuilding the filesystem?\nNote: I currently do not experience any particular problems with my device. However, I haven't wiped it even once since the purchase 3 years ago, and since that time it went through multiple updates, app crashes, etc. I know that APFS should theoretically be resistant to filesystem corruption, but at the same time I believe that no software is perfect and there is always risk of some bugs happening that could silently cause problems. I use a MacBook Air as my work PC and I did experience some consistency errors on my user partition that uses APFS, which did not cause any noticeable issues but were solved only by going into Recovery mode and running diskutil manually. So I am concerned that similar issues could be happening on the iPad in the background without attracting attention.\nThanks!\n\nA: \nErasing the key in this manner renders all files cryptographically inaccessible.\n\nThe data is still there - but no-one is ever going to be able to read it.\nLet me take a distant example… \nYou lose your house keys. All the furniture is still there, you just cannot get to it.\nThe difference in this case is the ease with which you could actually break a window to get in, or you could call a locksmith.\nThe locksmith required to decrypt your iOS data is not available on the other end of a phone call. It would require the involvement of probably something as rich & powerful as a government agency, determined to prove you are a terrorist.\nBecause of this encryption & the way that solid state storage works to spread the load, if you then restore or set up a brand new install, your old data is more than just un-decryptable, it's also been randomly overwritten too. Solid State storage doesn't write sequentially like an old hard drive. The concept of 'bad blocks' is not the same.\nOf course, you would never store the only copy of any data in a single location, especially not a fragile mobile device. Far more likely than file corruption is serious physical damage to the entire unit.\n", "Q: How to change the default text editing app in Quick Look? I want to customize which app is used to open all unknown plain text files from Quick Look. For example, for extension-less VERSION file, Quick Look shows Open with TextEdit:\n\nI'd like to make VSCode the default editor for unknown file types.\nBTW, to even achieve a textual preview of the VERSION file, I had to install https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen.\n\nUPDATE & solution: This question is indeed closely related to Replace Text Edit as the default text editor, the problem was that neither of the answers mentioned public.data which was necessary for the VERSION file in this example. (Without 'public.data', VSCode was offered for .txt files but not for extension-less files.)\nI've updated this answer to that question to include info about 'public.data', in which case this question is really a duplicate of Replace Text Edit as the default text editor.\n\nA: Extension-less files are tricky ones for OS to figure out if it is an executable or a text file. I have two README files, one of which is unix executable for some reason and I get a warning if I open it. Another is text file but still recognised as public.data as opposed to public.plain-text. \nmdls path/to/file\n\ngives you its kMDItemContentType. public.data files' QuickLook  are generated by \n/Users/me/Library/QuickLook/QLStephen.qlgenerator\n\nRun qlmanage -m to get a list. \nUnless you can find a QuickLook generator by VSCode, which can preview public.data files, you don't have much to do.\nI haven't used it, but this seems promising: \nhttps://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen\nOP's response\nThis worked: duti -s com.microsoft.VSCode public.data all \n\n\n*\n\n*Replace Text Edit as the default text editor\n\nA: *\n\n*Right click on any .txt file on your system.\n\n*Click on 'Get Info'\n\n*Find the Open With: section and choose the app you want.

I have a Mac Mini 2018 that I sometimes connect my headphones to. They work just fine. No issues with volume.\nBut if I connect the Mac Mini to a receiver (a Denon AVR-2106) via the minijack with a 3.5mm to RCA cable, then the volume on the speakers connected to the Denon is too low.\nThe volume on the Denon is in dB and starts in negative number (never understood why) and I have to crank it up to 0db and then I can barely hear the audio from the speakers. Also, I have to max the output volume setting on the Mac.\nWhat gives?\n\nA: This is because the jacks on the Mac are not line level inputs/outputs.\nI wrote an answer to a question in a similar vane that addresses this in much more detail: Use 3.5mm jack as line in for a musical instrument\nBut, to summarize it here, the audio jack is putting out a signal in milivolts that enough to drive a simple microphone, a headset or some small speakers.  When you connect to the line input of a piece of AV equipment, it's expecting a much higher voltage - ~1.5V.  So, what you need is something that acts as a pre-amp.   \n\nA: Just to provide an alternative which does not require extra hardware:\nI had this problem with my 2021 Mac Mini M1, and found the volume too low. I used the free eqMac software to increase the volume beyond \"100%\". Seems to work OK.\n\nA: It’s low since Apple gear drives consumer headphones. For more volume you would connect an amplifier (or pre-amp) to the output if your receiver expects too high impedance. \n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth headphones volume too low. Any 3rd party solution to boost?\n\n*How to stream music to a PC?\nYou also might have better luck with a different input or getting a Bluetooth receiver that’s designed to input into another system. \n\nA: The maximum output on the Mac Mini is 1Vrms which is the upper limit with a 3.3V supply. As conventional line-level outputs provide 2Vrms, you will need to crank up the volume on your amp by another 6dB.\nIn addition, please be aware that there are 2 volume controls in series. All controls except the very last one need to be set to 0dB, i.e. the Mac Mini volume MUST be set to maximum when using the headphone output as a line-level output.\n", "Q: I made an AppleScript app and Siri won't launch it I followed iFixit tutorial how to make \"AirPods connect\" app for Mac.

It's not recommended to use it locally for development purposes!\n\nDepending on your development environment a required local name resolution is usually done either by adding (managing) hosts to (with) the /etc/hosts file or with a local nameserver like macOS Server's DNS server or tools like dnsmasq.\nOne common setup for local domains in e.g dnsmasq is a local resolution with the /etc/resolver/ method (example: Valet (Laravel): DNS address can not be found). By adding a file with the name of the tld (e.g. dev) containing the IP of a name server (e.g. nameserver 127.0.0.1) and setting up an appropriate configuration in the dnsmasq config file, the local DNS server will be authorative for this tld. All requests to resolve *.dev domains will be directed to this name server.\nOther regular domains in the Internet with the same tld (e.g shopify.dev) won't be accesible then.\n\nYou can determine the various DNS resolvers in your system with the command scutil --dns.\nA result like\n...\nresolver #8\n  domain   : dev\n  nameserver[0] : 127.0.0.1\n  flags    : Request A records, Request AAAA records\n  reach    : 0x00030002 (Reachable,Local Address,Directly Reachable Address)\n...\n\nis an obvious indication that the regular tld dev is directed to a local DNS server.\nIf you don't use the .dev domain anymore locally you can simply remove the file /etc/resolver/dev (and modifying the dnsmasq.conf file is recommended).\nIf you still rely on some .dev* tld move over to .develop or .development (and /etc/resolver/develop or /etc/resolver/development respectively).\n", "Q: Why is my Mac in \"Presentation Mode\" after a clean reboot?

Usually that means it shows you a file-open window, displaying the directory it needs permission for. You can allow or deny access at that point.\nIf an app needs this permission and doesn't provide a way to actually give it the permission, the app is buggy and you should contact the developer for help.\n", "Q: Switching language input using Capslock: how to remove delay? I have U.S. and Japanese (Hiragana) input on the keyboard. There's a feature in macOS \"Use the Caps Lock key to switch to and from U.S.\". So, pressing Capslock switches between U.S. and Japanese fine for the most part, but the problem is that if I press Capslock immediately after typing a U.S. character, it does nothing. I have to wait a few moments before I can press Capslock to switch to Hiragana. Likewise, if I'm in Hiragana and I press Capslock immediately after finishing typing Hiragana, it does nothing. I have to wait a moment before pressing Capslock to change back to U.S.\nAnyone know how to remove this delay? It's frustrating.\n\nA: You might try adding Romaji to your Japanese input choices and playing with the preferences for Caps Lock and Shift Key action to see if you get the performance you want.\n\n\nA: I also face the same problem and it's really annoying.

I need to export one of my notes and upload it to a web site with file size restrictions (unfortunately I don't know the maximum size, but I have reason to believe it is 2 MB).\nA 12-page-long note, consisting only of written text/mathematics and a single grayscale imported figure in one of the pages is taking up 10+ MB, which is frankly outrageous. Also, I'm pretty sure taking out the figure would make little difference; seems like the developers never paid attention to exported file sizes.\nHow can I reduce this to fit into my 2 MB budget?\nIdeally I'd like to flip a switch inside Notability itself which reduced the export file size, but I don't think anything like that exists.\nOtherwise, I'm looking for free tools which would help me reduce the file size. EDIT: online tools are not a possibility, as I can't run the risk of my file being stored and later distributed somehow.\nI've already tried exporting a PDF from Preview.app with the \"Reduce File Size\" filter, which didn't make a difference.\nGhostscript fared a little better: gs -o out.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET in.pdf reduced the file size to 7 MB, but it's not enough for me.\nImageMagick's convert tool produced output that could be barely classified as readable, even at an alleged 600 DPI.\nI also tried exporting JPEGs from Notability and concatenating them with Preview.app, which produced a 4 MB file size, still unsuitable for me (and also, I lose vector rendering, searching, etc. that way, which if possible I'd like to retain).\nMy best result until now was running this 4 MB file through gs -o out.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET in.pdf (note ebook instead of printer). It is readable, although visibly compressed, and takes up 1.3 MB. Lacking any other options, this is the file I'm going to submit, but I'm hopeful there's a better solution.\nAny other suggestions?\n\nA: Assuming your top priority is to minimize file size. You are going to have to sacrifice and switch over to an image format. Notability uses a vast amount of vectors in order to keep your handing writing sharp and readable at any size, so we will need to discard that information in favor of a simpler , less sharp jpeg file. \nIf you have photoshop, export all the files from Notability into an image format and bring them into your desktop to work on. Opening all the images inside Photoshop, use the “save for web” feature and select the absolute minimum of colors possible. I suggest 2 colors for the page (background & lines), and and 3-5 colors for pens (black, red, blue, green, is okay with dithering ).\nThis will allow you to create an image with minimal compression, at a sharper resolution. \nIf you have GIMP (free and open source <3): You can add an extension that gives you similar functionality to that of Photoshop’s “save for web” function. Here is a guide to how to install and use its different options on TemplateToaster.com.\nThese are both options for bringing 1920x1080 images down to about ~<80 KB each with readable text and minimal compression.\nEdit:\nI thought I would include an example that I create with my own notes, exported to Jpeg directly from Goodnotes 5 (this works regardless of program). All images are at the native resoultion of 1668x2154\nBelow are the results you can expect to see. \n\nOn the right, are the original, straight from Goodnotes exported jpegs. On the left, are the images compressed down with the \"save for web\" plugin on Gimp.\nBelow are the options that I used for most of the pages, with the exception of pages with images, where instead the \"use web-optimized pallete\" option was selected. Note how there are only 5 colors.(page, page line, 2 pen colors, white text)\n\nUsing this option will retain all text sharpness from the original exported text. Below is difference in quality, on the left is the compressed image, and the right uncompressed. \n\nThis should answer your question. As previously stated, you cannot expect to maintain the .pdf format and submit your work under such a tight data budget. The size of all the files combined together in the first image is in relative to a normal folder with all the images inside. When .zipped, you can expect an even larger file reduction (depending of course on the level of compression that you select with something like 7zip). As I predicted in my orignal response, the average file size among the 13 pages is 76.38 kb, just 3.62 kb under. \n\nA: I discovered this by trial and error, and it did help.\n\n*\n\n*Tap on the Share icon in Notability\n\n*Tap on Other Apps\n\n*Choose the File format = Image, Image type = PNG, Page Range = All, or whatever you want\n\n*Tap on Share Note\n\n*Choose Print from the options which come up\n\n*You will see a preview. Pinch out to expand that to fill the whole page\n\n*Share again to Files app or wherever you want\n\nI have attached screenshots of the above steps. Hope that helps.\n\n\nA: You could use PDFsam to split your pdf into smaller parts and see if you can load the separate files. PDFsam stands for PDF split and merge. It's a free package and it runs on a mac. Maybe split your file into multiple files and see which ones will load. This may help you find what is causing the file to be so large. If file split PDF 3, for example, is 10 MB maybe you can track down why your file is so large and fix it at the source. If all the split files are large maybe that will tell you something.\n\nA: You could see if Exporting to PostScript and then re-distilling as PDF improves matters. In Preview, click on Export, and then hold Alt and click on the drop-down list of file Formats. (Alt will provide a bigger list of formats.)\nSelect PostScript, save the file, and then run the .ps file through GhostScript to create a new PDF. \nI'm a bit worried when you say that the text appears visibly compressed -- that would suggest that the text is an image, rather than ... well, text. Ideally, text data should be smaller than pages of images.\n\nA: I had good luck using Adobe Acrobat for this.\nOriginal file is from Notability, created entirely within Notability, all handwritten, etc. The result was  26 pages, 18.4MB.  Acrobat save as ... reduced size gave 11.8 MB.\nAcrobat export original as PNG with settings changed to have PNG resolution of 300 dpi (which I found quite readable) produces 26 PNG files.  Then \"create ... combine files\" to produce one PDF from the 26 PNGs produced 6.9MB.\nThen I saved the combined PDF using \"reduce size...\" and the result came out to 1.6MB.\nNote: the combined size of the PNGs as separate files is just 3MB, so the first combined file had a fair amount of overhead in combining them into a single PDF (i.e. 3.9MB \"penalty\"). The combined and then reduced PDF lost that, but also lost a little bit in readability.  I think if I changed the \"optimize\" settings I could probably get something that is exactly the same size as the 3MB combined size of the PNGs, and no loss in readability (but even the 1.6MB was still pretty good).\n\nA: If you are able to access the PDF files generated by Notability on a Mac, read on:\nI recently started using the following method reducing the size of PDF's exported by several apps (Scanner apps, Notability, etc) is the following:\nThe Preview app (free on a Mac) comes with a filter called \"Reduce file size\" that can be applied if you open a pdf and re-export it as pdf. There is a way to tweak the level of compression done by this filter without modifying the original filter.\nOpen the Colorsync Utility on your Mac, and find the filters through the Filters tab, choose Reduce File Size, and then duplicate it (the icon resembling a double-page on the right). It will create \"Reduce File Size Copy\" under Custom Filters. Tweak the Constrain Size under sampling and Quality under compression until you meet the desired compromise in the look/file size for the document.\nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: Sort folders by size in Finder Is there any way, to sort sub-folders in a folder or a whole volume (such as the root drive where macOS is installed) by size? Is it possible to do without resorting to a 3rd party app?\n\nA: If you open the folder in finder such that your sub-folders are displayed you can click on size at the top of the list. If the folder sizes are not displayed, open finder and under the View menu select \"Show View Options\". This brings up a pane like an image shown below.\n \nAt the bottom of the pane is a checkbox to determine folder size. Check the box and folder sizes will be displays. Then by clicking on the size near the top of the Finder window. the contents should be sorted by size. \nYou need to make sure size is shown in the Finder window. To ensure this is the case, in the pane we just looked at, be sure to check \"Size\".\n\nA: If you need to get an estimate of storage, and not always use the sorted mode, you can use About this Mac.app. \nOpen it, storage tab, manage, Documents tab, File Browser. This will take some time and CPU but it will sort everything eventually. \n", "Q: Can I use boot camp to install windows if I already have two versions of macOS?

There’s plenty of information about dual boot and dual operating systems but I just wanted some clarification before I go and ruin my machine and have to wipe it and restore everything\nThanks for your time and consideration any help is much appreciated\noutput of diskutil list\n\n\nA: I have heard of triple booting and people succeeding, so I don't think it will be a problem if you install windows and have 2 versions already. Just make sure to choose the correct partitions when using Bootcamp and setting up windows.\n\nA: If you have both the High Sierra and Catalina volumes in the same APFS container, then you should not have any problems using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows. You probably should have posted the output from the command diskutil list, so others could see if there might be some other issues regarding installing Windows. \n\nA: If you don't want to mess with your data on your internal storage then you could always go buy an SSD and Drive enclosure and install windows to that.  \nI used my windows computer to create a USB to go drive using a usb creator tool called Rufus and checked the Windows To Go option and Use External drives options and the result is that I have an external drive with windows on it that can be used on most new computers.\nYou could also just install windows directly to your drive without windows to go but you do run the risk that windows will install it's boot files to the EFI folder on your internal drive so I would recommend using Windows to go.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2015 13\" vs MacBook Air 2019 for Final Cut Pro X I've been thinking about a switch from my current 2015 MacBook Pro to the 2019 MacBook Air. I use Apple's Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X very consistently, so having a smooth workflow on these apps is a must.\nCurrent specs:\n- 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5\n- 8 GB Ram\nPotential upgrade specs:\n- 1.6 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5\n- 8 GM Ram\nMy current computer also has some issues with the screen and some of the screws on the bottom plate, which is why I've considered a switch. Do you think upgrading to the 2019 Air could suit my needs?\n\nA: Generally speaking, a MacBook Air is not the best system for heavy users of CPU-bound applications like Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X. The primary reason for this is that the thinner chassis has less efficient cooling than a larger machine like a MacBook Pro, resulting in the CPU being more likely to throttle down to lower speeds more quickly when it gets hot.\nIf you can afford it, a better upgrade for your use case may be a 13\" MacBook Pro but be aware that a refreshed model is rumoured to be being released this year, with an upgraded keyboard (the same keyboard as in the 2019 MacBook Pro 16\" and 2020 MacBook Air).\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to partition screen I've recently started using a Macbook on a new job (macOS 10.15), coming from a Windows 10, and then more a Ubuntu background. \nA feature that both Windows 10 and Ubuntu had was the ability to have an application use half of a given display, by pressing the special + ⬅ or ⮕.

The upgrade itself doesn't bring everything up to date, the apps that are not part of the OS and some nonessential components are updated later.\nIf you are stuck with the lack of dictionaries for a prolonged time (more than a day and a couple or so of restarts), and especially if you see the degraded overall performance of your Mac, most probably the updating process is broken. I had the same picture yesterday, so I've started investigating and solved it. Maybe you have the same bug that I have had, maybe not. Still, I hope my solution would help, and to make it more general, I will describe the process, too -- so that even if your source of trouble is different, you can find your own solution.\nSo, first I've opened the Activity Monitor to found that trustd and nsurlsessiond are eating up the CPU. I even had to kill trustd (nsurlsessiond went down after that, too) so that I could continue to work without lots of spinballs. It looked like trustd tries to verify some app, and calls nsurlsessiond for update information and/or update itself, which, in turn, fails. \nThen I've opened the Console and started searching in logs for nsurlsessiond -- and found lots of records that __mkdir failed to create a directory, \"not permitted\". The directory in question was /private/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n00000y800007k/0 . I went to its parent /private/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n00000y800007k and I've found in the Get Info that while _nsurlsessiond as a user had Read and Write permission, as a group it had Read only permission. Now, /private/var/folders/zz/ is not a place to mess with, but adding a permission to a known daemon and creation of a new directory are not that dangerous, so I did both: changed the permission of group _nsurlsessiond for /private/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n00000y800007k to Read and Write (to do that you must first unlock it in the right-down corner of Get Info box), and created a new folder \"0\" in it, making sure it also gets Read and Write privilege for _nsurlsessiond.\nThen I've restarted, and let the Mac idle for a while. Soon App Store showed updates for some apps that I didn't even remember. I let them all update, updated some other apps that could not auto-update previously (such as Chrome), and again let it idle or semi-idle while I was browsing the web etc. I intentionally avoided opening the Dictionary app at that time. Today I restarted the Mac again, opened the Dictionary app, and found that all its dictionary tabs  are back; when I've clicked on the German tab, it said \"wait a minute for a download\" and almost immediately showed me the dictionary. All the other dictionaries were back, too, after that.\n", "Q: How can I use my Mac to determine the optimal WiFi channel to use with my wireless router? I'm setting up a new router and want to manually select the best channel, how can I run a scan of the networks around me to figure out which channel will have the best performance?\n\nA: Don’t.\nThere are many apps that you can use from the built in Network Diagnostics to commercial grade WiFi mapping and analyzers.  Trying to find which channel to use is pointless nowadays.  Unless you’re using a 10+ year old WiFi router that doesn’t handle automatic channel switching well, there’s no need to do this.\nModern WAPs (wireless access point) auto select the best channel for you based on existing traffic and this can change continually given the explosion of wireless devices which we are using every day.  Bluetooth devices, wireless peripherals,  our phones and devices are all crowding the airwaves.  So, what you “capture” today and determine what’s the best channel now might change the next day or even later that afternoon!\nThe problem with selecting your own channel is that the WAP won’t automatically switch to another when the one it’s manually configured to use becomes saturated with traffic.  Yes, you can actually make the problem worse!\nLet your WAP (aka your “router”) handle the channel selection.  If yo’re in a situation where there’s just too much traffic, it’s better to put a second WAP (Like a WiFi extender) closer to where you use your devices.  \n\nA: You can easily determine the best channels to use in the native Wireless Diagnostics scanner:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"Wireless Diagnostics\" Application\n\n*Ignore the prompts and open \"Window\", \"Scan\" in the menu bar\n\n*Press \"Scan Now\"\n\n\nThe recommended channel(s) for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz will now be present in the Summary pane.\n\nMore info on OSXDaily.\n", "Q: I can't upgrade my Mac from macOS Sierra to macOS Mojave. Admin password required So because of the quarantine my school sent me a computer to do my work and I want to upgrade the OS. It's running macOS Sierra, and I wish to upgrade it to run macOS Mojave. I can't do so as it keep asking me for administrator name and password.\nIs there anyway to get around this?\n\nA: Your Mac is asking for an administrator name and password for a reason. It wants to make sure that only an authorised user is making a major change to the computer as upgrading the operating system software.\nYou generally cannot work around it. You'll need an administrator username and password to be able to upgrade macOS. You should consider getting in touch with the person/team responsible for this and seek their assistance.\n\nA: Perhaps they don’t want you to do things like upgrades or install other / unknown apps as you might break things they have put in place for your benefit.\nIt would be a headache for them if you messed up the programs that are installed for remote learning for example.\n", "Q: how to install mac OS (Sierra) from USB drive, I am out of options I have been fighting with this problem for some days now and I gave up solving it looking for a solution on google.\nI have a Macbook Air (late 2010) which had Lion.

Since I am completely not using its e-mail address for communication nor Mail application, it took me several months to realize that I have completely empty Inbox all the time (other boxes like Sent are full) and I cannot receive any e-mail to it. This my only Apple device that I have, if that matters.\n(all cites and text below are my own translation from Polish)\nI can send e-mail to this device as normally:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm sending them from my PC, through Gmail to firstname.lastname@icloud.com,\n\n*I've sent dozens of e-mails like that past months and none of them were ever returned with error,\n\n*Mail says \"Updated: a moment ago\" (after manual Inbox refresh / forced fetch), but Inbox remains empty.\n\n\nAccount seems to be working normally:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can install and update any application from App Store using this account / e-mail address,\n\n*Settings > iCloud shows this account in second line,\n\n*Settings > iCloud > iTunes and App Store shows this account as my Apple ID,\n\n*Settings > iCloud > Advanced > Mail > shows this address as Email and has SMTP pointing to iCloud SMTP server.\n\n\nMail application seems to be working normally:\n\n\n*\n\n*since I'm not using this e-mail / account for e-mail exchange at all, Inbox, Drafts, Spam, Bin and Archive boxes are empty,\n\n*Sent box contains about 40-60 e-mails ever sent by me directly from this device,\n\n*I can sent any e-mail from this device and within 1-2 minutes I can receive it in my Gmail.\n\n\nMy Gmail shows me 20 e-mails sent to firstname.lastname@icloud.com in 2013-2020 period. None of them can be found in my Inbox, Spam or Bin. All these folders remains empty.\nDirectly before writing this question I've sent two e-mail to my account / @icloud.com e-mail / iPad. One was a new message, the other one was a reply to a message that I've sent to myself from this iPad just a minute ago. None of these messages were rejected / returned with error. None of these messages were received by iPad -- Inbox remains empty as of writing this.\nThis problem is so weird to me that I don't even know where to start tracking for a source of problem or for a possible solution.\nFor past 25+ years, since I've been using e-mails it was always either message delivered to the account or message rejected. So far I was lucky enough to never lost a message, i.e. like with this iPad -- message neither received nor rejected and returned to sender.\n\nA: Since:\n\n\n*\n\n*other boxes and\n\n*other iCloud account's aspects\n\n\nare working without any problems, my suspicions came to Inbox directly.\nAfter reading this answer and this blog post it turned out that I have mail forwarding + delete source message option enabled. All my e-mails are being forwarded to the account that I stopped checking years ago.\nTurning delete source message option off resolved this particular case and e-mails started to appear / remain in my Inbox as previously.\n", "Q: Shop for new ipad apps from web? I've ordered a new ipad pro; yay!  It has yet to arrive.  In my anticipation; I'd like to browse the app store and make a list of apps to investigate.  How do I do this?\nWhile I've owned some iphones in the past, I currently only have a mac.  The Music app, only browses the music store.  The Mac App store appears to only offer mac apps (I tried searching for Procreate and nothing shows).  If I try the web at https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/, it only directs me to the app.  Searching generically for an app (e.g. procreate), I find https://apps.apple.com/us/app/procreate/id425073498, but url manipulation doesn't avail; I find no generic search box or navigation page.\nHave I missed anything obvious?  Is there no way to see the ipad/iphone app catalog outside of one of those devices?\n\nA: Apple unfortunately removed that option some time ago, same time as app management was removed from iTunes.\n[Kept brief under advisement from a mod ;)\n\nA: You can search the internet for things like \"Best Editing Apps ios\" or \"Top games ios\" and other gazillion terms. And you should get plenty of hits. I'd take the most recent return and look at that. You'll find many dated 2020. And most matches will have things like top ten or top 20 so they'll be plenty of apps to make note off.  This will find App Store apps as well as other apps and in most cases tell you which one it is and the price.\n\nA: You can find an overview of the most popular apps here : https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36 and sometimes the 'Open in iTunes' button will appear in the upper right corner of the screen.\nBesides that, as @Tetsujin said Apple no longer allows searching from iTunes/internet.\n", "Q: Verify OS X Base System Mac Pro (Late 2013) macOS Mavericks\nInternet Recovery Mode:\nOS X Utilities:\nDisk Utility:\n\n    disk0\n\n      OS X Base System\n\nI can verify \"OS X Base System\" but not erase, restore or alter partition layout?\n\nA: macOS Internet Recovery is a NetBoot-like service. Basically, a bootable image is downloaded via HTTP (from an Apple or an Akamai server) into RAM and your Mac boots to it afterwards.\nSo yes, you can run First Aid on the OS X Base System volume and it will not erase, restore or alter partition layout because it's not a writable volume.\n\nSince it has to be assumed that the image was verifed already after the download has finished and the boot process was successful, why do you want to verify the OS X Base System again?\n", "Q: Random pages printing with curl command I need some help with this...\nMy printer (hp inkjet) will randomly print 3 pages with just a header that includes the curl command (see photo) since this is a major waste of paper, how do I get this to stop? \nI don’t have any server type apps installed so I don’t know what’s going on.\n\nIs someone getting in to my printer or how would I know if my Mac is sending these to the printer?\n\nA: Do you have a netgear router?\nLook here and search for “printer”.

You can do this with thumb drives, over the network or just download a fresh copy from the developer's web site.\nYou are not \"creating\" an app, you are just copying it.\nIf you check the developer's web site it should indicate what version(s) of macOS the app you have is compatible with. You may need to know what version you have (Sublime Text menu > About Sublime Text) as often different versions are compatible with only some versions of macOS.\n\nA: All you need to do is copy the following files from the old MacOs computer:\n~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Package Control.sublime-settings\n~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings\nAlso make sure you find the old email with the license you purchased, and make note of the disabled packages, as those may not be disabled when you restart the app with the new config.\nThen on the new MacOs:\n\n*\n\n*install the ST3\n\n*install PackageControl\n\n*Copy the files over to ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/\n\n*Restart the application\n\n*NOTE: You may have to restart it a few times, it can be buggy until the config reinstalls all the packages from the .sublime-settings files.\n\nYou don't need all the settings packages in the User directory, those will automatically be reinstalled on restart. I guess it wouldn't hurt to grab them all, but usually new Mac == new settings. The \"Package Control.sublime-settings\" will automatically install all the packages listed in it.\nI am about to migrate Macs, I will update this when that is completed to verify it works!\nThis is also answered in the Apple Stack overflow.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/11365948/how-to-save-restore-sublime-text-2-configs-plugins-to-migrate-to-another-compute/62581108#62581108\n", "Q: My SMB shares won't mount under Catalina! What's wrong? I am in the process of migrating from Mojave, on my iMac's internal HDD, to Catalina, on a USB 3.1 SSD.\nI have an AppleScript that runs on login, \"Connect to servers and set mouse pointer.\" It mounts my SMB shares, resets several Finder windows to icon view without toolbar, closes the finder windows opened, and then trips Mousecape, to set my mouse pointer to look like a small rodent.\nEverything works just fine under Mojave, but the SMB shares aren't mounting under Catalina.\nThe very first thing it does is mount my SMB shares, using code of the following form (once for each share):\ntry\n    open location \"smb://uuuuuuuu:pppppppp@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/dddddddd\"\nend try\n\nwhere uuuuuuuu is my user-ID, and pppppppp is my password, on the Linux box hosting the SMB share, at local IP address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, and name dddddddd.\nThis works perfectly under Mojave, but under Catalina, it (1) throws up a dialog showing the user-ID and asking for my password, and (2) rejects the password when entered.\nCan anybody shed any light on what's going on here?\nAs per https://medium.com/@gobinathm/how-to-access-smb-printer-shares-in-macos-catalina-10-15-17ea91d2c10b, I added an nsmb.conf file; doing so had no effect.\nI think I found something: on StackExchange, I stumbled onto something about Catalina removing support for SMB 1 protocol. With some further research, I found out about the \"smbstatus\" command at https://askubuntu.com/questions/917565/checking-smb-version. I ran it on the Linux box serving the SMB shares, and got this, with my Mac connected under Mojave:\nSamba version 3.0.33-3.14.el5\nPID     Username      Group         Machine                        \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n32496   jamesl        users         jamess-imac  (192.168.1.11)\n32499   jamesl        users         jamess-imac  (192.168.1.11)\nOpened /var/cache/samba/connections.tdb\n\nService      pid     machine       Connected at\n-------------------------------------------------------\nshared       32499   jamess-imac   Wed Apr  1 15:19:22 2020\ndevelopment   32496   jamess-imac   Wed Apr  1 15:19:22 2020\n\nCould this be it? The Linux box in question is running CentOS 5.4, FWIW.\n\nA: It turns out that the version of Samba (3.0) running on the server only does SMB1, whereas Catalina requires at least SMB2 (which didn't come in until Samba 3.5).\nCaught between a rock and a hard place.\nGiven that the Samba box (1) is now only being used, at least on any sort of regular basis, by me, making it gross overkill, (2) is literally doing nothing but serving SMB1 and consuming power, and (3) is a 15-year-old Dell 400SC, I'm probably going to replace it outright. Possibly with a thumb drive.\n\nA: You can easily mount your favorite volume with AutomountMaker\n", "Q: Why can't I create a .ssh directory on macOS 10.15.4?

I have two macs, that need to mount each other's respective network shares but also both need to restart every night.\nThe trouble is, neither computer can mount the other until the other is fully booted up with the volume ready.\nHow can I solve this without needing to use a paid 3rd party application?\nI did find this question which is asking about a very similar need, but the top answer doesn't work because the user will always first be prompted to select the share they want to mount and this needs to happen unattended in the middle of the night.\nIf I can schedule the mountings, then each computer can just unmount the volume in question and restart (easy to do in Automator), and then some time later after both machines will easily be ready, re-mount their needed shares.\nSo, how can I simply schedule each machine to mount the required remote share, at a specified time?\n\nA: Believe I have solved this on my own.  The part that wasn't working for me, was that Automator would always prompt me to select the specific share/folder I wanted to mount.  Turns out I missed the obvious - specify the folder in the path provided in an Applescript!  Like so:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if not (disk \"FolderName\" exists) then\n        mount volume \"afp://MyMac.local/FolderName\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\nNow I'm just going to put a few-minutes pause before this command, and set the resulting Automator app to run at startup.  If both machines unmount the remote volumes and reboot at the same time each night, all should be well with the world.  In order to schedule the execution of my automator commands, I'm just using the Calendar's ability to launch a file on alert.\n", "Q: Remote Management Wizard Not Showing On First Use I have a new MBP bought through Apple Business and registered in Apple Business Manager.

I tried a few times, in the end turned the machine off.\nI rang Apple and they said reinstall macOS. I did so, and since then I've never had the Remote Management interface pop up. I just get the normal consumer experience which is useless to me.\nApple believe there's an issue with the Intune configuration. I'm not convinced as I followed the Intune documentation for setting this up and everything checks out. Syncs are occurring, the device is visible as pending enrollment, good signals on both Intune and ABM side.\nI think the mac is stuck in consumer mode now and doesn't know to check for MDM settings?\nI've tried deleting the Macintosh HD - Data volume, erasing the Macintosh HD volume and reinstalling. No change. If I continue the consumer setup experience I just get a normal, non-managed mac.\nAny ideas on:\nA - Is it stuck in consumer mode?\nB - Should I try anything on the Intune side? I'm contemplating deleting all Device Configuration policies to simplify things so only the Enrollment program token profile is left.\n\n\n\nA: I managed to reset the device so the Remote Management wizard comes back up on device setup. I believe the steps that fixed it were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off mac\n\n*Unassign device from MDM in ABM\n\n*Re-assign device to MDM in ABM\n\n*Assign profile again in Intune\n\n*Sync devices in Intune\n\n*Reinstall macOS via Delete Macintosh HD - Data volume delete method\n\n\nThough now I'm left with an unusual credential prompt. I have no idea what identity it expects. ABM is federated with Azure AD and as this isn't an Office 365 login screen that rules out corporate credentials. It's not an ABM credential either.

So I then shutdown the Mac and it turned off.\nSince then, camera has not worked.

So I partitioned a new part. I would then jump to windows and allocate that new untitled partition to Windows, but I can't get back to Windows. Is there a solution to this? I'm fine with reinstalling windows if thats an option. However, I would like my windows key, if that is possible. I followed this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhkdOLXT6Eg.\nOperating System: Sierra 10.12.6\nI also looked at this post, but I can not figure out what to do.\nMac won't boot Windows partition after using disk utility\nThanks\n\nA: You will need to boot into Windows to access the recovery key. Do you have the T2 security chip? If so, try disabling Secure Boot. Apple doesn't recommend resizing the Bootcamp partition so that might be the issue.\n\nA: If Windows was installed using the Boot Camp Assistant, then neither Apple nor Microsoft offer a practical way to increase the Windows partition, other than remove and reinstall Windows.\nThe Boot Camp Assistant will only install Windows 10 on the newer Mac models. If you have an older model, the Boot Camp Assistant may still be able to install an older version of Windows. Afterwards, you may be able to upgrade to Windows 10.\nIf Windows 10 is activated, then you do not need the product key to reinstall or upgrade. However, if you first reinstalled an older version of Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8 or 8.1), you may need the product key for the older version.\nIn your question, you stated you partitioned. If this was successful and Windows does not boot, then you probably have Windows installed to BIOS boot. An effort could be made to try an make Windows bootable. There may be no point in trying, if you are going to reinstall Windows anyway. This a decision you will have to make.\nIf you have an older model Mac and the Boot Camp Assistant will not let you install Windows 10, then it is usually possible to install Windows 10 without using the Boot Camp Assistant. The instruction depend on your model Mac. \nI should mention there are third party tools that can aid in enlarging the Windows partition without the loss of data. WinClone is one such product.\nComment about the Linked Video\nThe video is a deliberate attempt to deceive the viewer. At the time the video was made the Boot Camp Assistant only installed BIOS booting Windows. This required using hybrid partitioning. The MiniTool Partitioning Wizard does not properly handle hybrid partitioned drives. Specifically, the Wizard correctly updates the MBR partition table, but fails to update the Guid Partition Table (GPT). The video is fraudulent and anyone with experience can easily see this. At time mark 1:46, free space is created between the OS X partitions and the Windows partition. At time mark 2:40, the free space can be viewed as occurring after the Windows partition. So, at some point not shown in the video, changes were made. At time mark 3:15, the Windows partition is extended. In fact, the Windows partition would also need to be moved to be beginning of the free space created at time mark 1:46.\nComment about the Linked Question\nI would advise not to follow any answers to a question that were not accepted by the OP and have comments that indicate none of answers worked.\n", "Q: MacOS Cannot format to APFS I am experiencing an identical problem to the one in: Unable to format internal drive as APFS on 2018 MacBook Pro\nHowever this thread in unanswered and unresolved\nMy internal drive can format to everything except APFS, I have tried troubleshooting via linux, and simple disk utility.

Virustotal\nPowerLog is usually bundled with other free software that you download from the Internet. Unfortunately, some free downloads do not adequately advertise that other software is being installed, and you may find that you installed PowerLog without your knowledge.\nThe PowerLog ads may have different text in the popup: \"Powered by PowerLog\", \"Advertisements by PowerLog\", \"Brought to you by PowerLog\", \"Ads by PowerLog\", or \"Ads powered by PowerLog\". These ads are designed to encourage the installation of additional questionable content, including web browser toolbars, optimization utilities, and other products, so that the PowerLog publisher can generate pay-per-click revenue.\nNote: Once installed, PowerLog installs another app of this type called MacPerformance. This app forces browsers to open websites that offer updates for software with fake tools. You can see the PowerLog process in the Activity Monitor: It is displayed as \"PowerLift\".\nWhen your device is infected with the PowerLog adware, the following symptoms are common:\n\n*\n\n*Ads appear in places where they shouldn't be.\n\n\n*Your web browser's home page has mysteriously changed without your permission.\n\n\n*Web pages you normally visit do not display properly.\n\n\n*Website links direct you to websites other than those you expected.\n\n\n*Browser pop-ups will appear recommending fake updates or other software.\n\n\n*Other unwanted programs may be installed without your knowledge.\nHow to remove PowerLog adware\nGo to the system settings.\nClick Profiles.\nThe list contains the entry \"AdminPrefs\". Select this option and click the \"-\" button in the lower left corner.\nNote: If there is no profile icon, no profiles are installed. This is normal.\nOpen \"Finder\" an click on \"Applications\". Find and remove the PowerLog app. Also look for MPlayerX, NicePlayer, or any other suspicious application and drag it to the Trash. After removing the potentially unwanted applications that are causing online ads, scan your Mac for any remaining unwanted components\nAvoid launchd trying to start this program again. Delete the associated files from the following paths\n/Library/LaunchAgents \n\n~/Library/LaunchAgents \n\n/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\nLook for recently added suspicious files in the LaunchAgents folder and move them to the Trash. Examples of files generated by adware - \"installmac.AppRemoval.plist\", \"myppes.download.plist\", \"mykotlerino.ltvbit.plist\", \"kuklorest.update.plist\", etc. Adware typically installs multiple files with the same string.\nLook for recently added suspicious files in the LaunchDaemons folder. For example \"com.aoudad.net-Settings.plist\", \"com.myppes.net-Settings.plist\", \"com.kuklorest.net-Settings.plist\", \"com.avickUpd.plist\" and delete it.\nCheck for adware-generated files in the (~)/Library/Application\\ Support folder. Also, look for recently added suspicious folders in the Application Support folder. For example \"MplayerX\" or \"NicePlayer\" and move these folders to the trash.\nLast uninstall the PowerLog extension from Safari, Chrome, or Firefox.\nBut you can also use Malwarebytes or Combo Cleaner. They can also remove it.\n", "Q: AppleScript error: “Finder got an error: Network file permission error.” I have an automator script that I use to create an empty file in finder and I've been using it with no problem for about a year.

In my MacBook Pro 15\" with touch bar, it even shows a 'Move to \"SOME MAILBOX\"' icon on the touch bar. On other messages which I usually leave in the inbox, it merely shows 'Move to...' without suggesting a mailbox.\nIs there a way to make Mail.app automatically move these messages when they're received to the suggested mailbox, without having to manually press this icon in the touch bar?\nNote: I know there's a conventional \"Rules\" tab in Preferences, as well as the Gmail filters feature (all my emails use Gmail). Once upon a time I had enough patience to try to set up these rules for specific senders, etc. Unfortunately, over time, these rules get obsolete as senders change the email they're sending from, and the rules need updating. It's just too much hassle so I've given up on this route. Mail.app does a great job of classifying emails with the feature mentioned above, all I'm looking for is a way to automate the process.\n\nA: If you have a Gmail account, try going to gmail.com and making the specific senders go to a new folder.

I want to get the name of the song, be able to play/pause, skip, and even seeking if that is possible.\n\nA: I made a cli tool that lets you read properties from the private MediaRemote framework.\nhttps://github.com/kirtan-shah/nowplaying-cli\nSince it uses private APIs, it may break with future macOS updates but is currently working on Ventura 13.1.\nHere is an example that will retrieve the song name:\n\n\nThe tool also supports commands like play/pause:\nnowplaying-cli play\n\nIf you want to call this from AppleScript you can use the following syntax:\ndo shell script \"<your command>\"\n\n\nA: This is a very useful tool and I have a recommendation on the best place to learn how to use AppleScript to interact with media.\n\n*\n\n*https://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php\nThis is 100% possible and you might even find the exact script you need, already written.

(I cannot see details of Photo Booth as it crashes too quickly.)\nIs anyone experiencing the same? Any fixes?\n\nA: Without considerably more information, it's impossible to pinpoint the cause.\nHowever, PhotoBooth is an Apple-supplied app that comes with the OS, so it should not crash under normal conditions. The likelihood is that you've got something installed which is causing both these apps to crash. \nI would recommend using EtreCheck, which is an excellent app that gives you a report of the 'state' of your system. It highlights third-party additions that are potential sources of problems, particularly if they are old and no longer compatible with a new OS.\nYou can upload the contents of the report here (or somewhere list Pastebin) if you need more help.\n", "Q: Is it safe to leave the iMac turned off for months at a time? Is it safe to leave your iMac turned off for months at a time? I haven’t used it for a while, and won’t be using it for some time while in lockdown.\nWill it be ok performance wise?\nThanks\n\nA: \nIs it safe to leave your iMac turned off for months at a time?\n\nYes, it is perfectly safe to leave your iMac turned off for months, as long you follow the proper storage guidelines, i.e. keep it in a cool and dry place and away from exposure to dust. Specifically, follow the storage guidelines laid out by Apple, as discussed here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Important handling information for your Mac\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Storage temperature: -40° to 116° F (-40° to 47° C)\n  \n*Relative humidity: 5% to 95% (noncondensing)\nStoring your iMac. If you are going to store your iMac for an extended period of time, keep it in a cool location (ideally, 71° F or 22° C).\n\nStoring an iMac unused for an extended period of time won't have any affect on its performance.\n", "Q: How to completely silence the other party in a call on iOS Is there a way to completely silence the person on the other end of the call in iOS?\nIt appears that lowering the volume while a call is in progress doesn't silence the speaker completely, unlike when a call is not in progress.\n \nIs there a way to silence the other party completely in the call?\n\nA: One to completely silence the other caller is to plug in a headphone auxiliary audio cable. You may need one with an inline mic such as this one. This tricks iOS into thinking that there is an external output device and reroutes the output audio virtually into nothingness. The microphone is also switched to use the external microphone. \n", "Q: Deleting a suspicious malware (imklaunchagent) in Mac I have a MacBook Pro (macOS Mojave) laptop and have recently noticed a suspicious process in Activity Monitor with this name : imklaunchagent\n\nI checked this folder:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/InputMethodKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/imklaunchagent and it seems imklaunchagent and its related files cannot be removed. I tried to remove it via Terminal and this message showed up: \"Operation not permitted\". However, in \"Security and Privacy\" of \"System Preferences\", I chose Terminal to have full disk access, still can't delete the file and the same message appears.\nI installed the free version of Combo Cleaner and it detected other viruses, none of which are imklaunchagent. Is imklaunchagent a malware? How can it be deleted?\n\nA: You can't (see † below) remove that file because MacOS doesn't let you (or anyone) alter the contents of /System. Only Apple can write to that location. \nMacOS does that to ensure the integrity of the OS. In other words, if it's in /System, it's part of the OS.\n† By 'can't', I mean in the normal running of your computer, unless you yourself follow a particular procedure which no active software can perform by itself as a means of corrupting your system.\n", "Q: VLC command line volume control I use VLC in command line mode on macOS and would like to set the volume from the command line as well.

You can verify the same by running the following command in the Terminal.app:\nxattr <path_to_the_document>\nwhich should display the following:\n\ncom.apple.quarantine\n\nTo remove the quarantine flag from a document you trust is coming from a reliable source, run the following command:\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine <path_to_the_document>\nThe Terminal.app would ask you to enter your admin/login password. You can verify that the flag is removed by re-running the former command mentioned above.\n", "Q: Are time machine directory exclusions recursive? In macOS 10.15.3, using Time Machine Preferences GUI I have excluded /usr and /System from backups.\nIn the terminal I get:\n% tmutil isexcluded /usr/      \n[Excluded]    /usr\n\n% tmutil isexcluded /usr/local/       \n[Included]    /System/Volumes/Data/usr/local\n\nI was expecting /usr/local to be recursively excluded but it isn't. Why? How can I excluded things recursively?\n\nA: Yes, directory exclusion are recursive. This means that if you exclude for example ~/MyDocuments/ then everything in that folder and beneath is excluded. That includes for example ~/MyDocuments/SubFolder/document.docx.\nHowever, there are some special cases. When you have a non hard-link, the link itself is excluded, but the link is not followed to exclude the objects linked to. This means that a symbolic link or firm link, like you have in your case, is excluded from the backup - but not what it links to.\nIn your case /usr/local is not really a subfolder of /usr, but rather a link. This is the reason you see that /usr/local, which is really /System/Volumes/Data/usr/local, is not excluded when you exclude /usr.\nNote that excluding a directory does not exclude the volumes mounted under that directory. For example sudo tmutil exclude -p /System will only exclude directories in the volume / (but not other volumes mounted to /System/Volume/ e.g. /System/Volume/Data/). \nAccording to the man page:\n\nThe third kind of exclusion is a volume exclusion. These track volumes\n  based on file system UUID, which is persistent across volume name and\n  mount path changes.\n\nTherefore sudo tmutil exclude -v / will exclude folders and volumes (including /System/Volume/Data/).\n", "Q: Click handler in Apple Script I created a standalone macOS app using Script Editor. Upon starting, the app executes a bash script and upon quitting, the app executes another bash script.

I would like the finder to open a specific folder when I click on the app symbol in the dock. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: Getting your application to respond specifically to a user clicking on its dock icon is difficult.  A simpler task is to get your application to respond to acquiring focus where it previously belonged to another application, i.e. whenever your application is brought into the foreground, which clicking on the dock icon will do.\nI've heavily commented the script below to walk you through what's relevant.  Anything I've left uncommented or haven't specifically made reference to in the comments should be left alone and where it is, unless you're confident you know what you're doing.\nObviously, this won't do a lot if it's simply run from within Script Editor, so incorporate this into your application's AppleScript code (or, rather, incorporate your application's AppleScript code into this), save it, and run the applet.  If you don't make any edits to it whatsoever, then when saved as an applet, you'll see a notification appear every 10 seconds telling you the application is \"idling...\"; and a dialog box will pop-up whenever the application is brought into focus informing you that it \"Acquired focus.\".\n-----------------------------------------------------------|\non run\n    _init()\n\n    # Your startup code goes here, which will\n    # execute once when your application runs\n    # e.g.\n    #   do shell script \"/path/to/start-script.sh\"\nend run\n\non idle\n    # Any code you need to run repeatedly can\n    # go here.

I opened it up, checked that the power supply is OK (it's outputting 12 V just fine, and not just on its own, but with all connectors plugged in), cleaned everything with compressed air, but it's still dead.\nI'm looking for a replacement WiFi repeater/router, and obviously with the discontinuation of the AirPort line, it's not an option. Looks like mesh WiFi is all the rage these days. My question is, are they going to be compatible with the existing Time Capsule in the network? Can anyone recommend a specific model which they've had success with? And while beggars can't be choosers, I'd really like to keep using the Ethernet connection to avoid wasting wireless bandwidth if possible.\n\nA: I would avoid this type of setup for two reasons:\n\n*\n\n*Security.  I’m not at all comfortable with putting my data on the “edge” of the network the way these devices do.\n\n*Availability and reliability.  The problem with all-in-one devices like this is if it goes down, you lose everything all at one.\n\nI talk more about in another answer for a similar question.\nGetting two separate devices like a NAS (For the TM Backups) and a dedicated router brings in a level of reliability and availability that you don’t get with these bundled devices.\nPlus, you get the added benefit of being able to upgrade the individual components of your setup to the latest features (i.e. mesh on your wireless) without having to worry about your storage; and vice versa.\nIf you have the technical skill (it sounds like you do), I would go with a pfSense router (Community Edition; free) and put it on a cheap desktop.  You can add a WiFi adapter directly to box or go with the Ubiquiti setup I talked about in the link above.\n\nA: There are Airport Extremes available on Amazon and Ebay.  \n", "Q: Can a deteriorating battery cause screen flickering? [Early 2015 macbook pro retina] I have a early 2015 macbook pro with a Retina display. I'm at about 950 charge cycles, and have had the \"service battery\" indicatory since last summer. \nI noticed that occasionally my screen does this flickering thing. It happens maybe a few times a day. Each time it \"flickers\" is usually just a single off/on cycle. Could this be associated with the battery? Or could be having some other hardware component issues? \nI've reset my SMC a few times since last summer, but it didn't solve the flickering.\n\nA: You have two distinct problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Battery Issue. \nYou've already diagnosed it - 950 cycles and the service battery indicator pretty much says it all.  From 2013 on, you'll have to replace the top case because Apple glues them in, but the battery can be replaced quite inexpensively.\n\n*Display Issue.\nThe flickering can be caused by a number of things like a logic board issue, a faulty connector, a bad LCD, etc.  I would try running Apple Diagnostics by holding D  while booting from a powered off state to see if you can get a diagnostic code however, chances are you're going to have to take/send it in for service. \nA battery, generally, will not cause issues like this because it doesn't dump \"raw\" power directly from the battery to the logic board.  It actually goes through some circuitry to \"level\" everything off and split it out into the correct voltages the system needs (12V, 5V, 3V, etc).  If the battery was causing the problem, you'd see it everywhere on your Mac, not in just one place.  \nThat said, to diagnose properly, you would disconnect the battery completely from the logic board and see if the problem exists on power only.  If it shows up, you've got your answer.\n", "Q: Mac mini Problem - Won't boot after upgrading to High Sierra (Bless) I bought a used Mac mini from a reliable source. He factory reset it, so we set about upgrading to the highest we can, High Sierra. I created a bootable USB on my iMac using the High Sierra installer. Inserted it, booted from it and installed the OS. \nAll looked good, and we got into the OS on first load. Upon restarting, it says “MacOS could not be installed on your computer. An error occurred while loading the installer resources”\n\"Quit the installer to restart your computer and start again\". Weird, because the installation has finished and the USB drive is no longer in there. \nIt also mentioned something about bless but I can't remember what. \nThis machine has an SSD, I THINK when it arrived there were two partitions but only one now. I have no idea about SSDs, never used one before. Does it need a separate partition for booting or something? \nTotally lost, would be very grateful for some help.\n\nA: If you startup with the USB drive again, try to use the Disk Utility (available pre-install) to set the Startup/Internal Drive (\"blessing\" it).\n", "Q: What are all possible ways a keyboard shortcut could be bound in Safari? What are all of the ways a keyboard shortcut could be bound in Safari?\nI am aware of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The app’s own standard shortcuts\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts >\n\n\n*\n\n*App Shortcuts >\n\n\n*\n\n*All Applications\n\n*Safari\n\n\n*Services\n\n\n*Safari Extensions\n\n*KeyBindings.dict\n\n*3rd party utility applications\n\n\n*\n\n*Alfred\n\n*FastScripts\n\n*Keyboard Maestro\n\n\n\nAre there other obvious paths I could be missing? Are there ways of figuring out how a specific keybinding is being handled?\nFor context, I created a utility shortcut for myself to send the current Safari tab to Chrome by pressing ^c. I did this a few years ago with an Alfred Workflow, with a Hotkey trigger scoped to com.apple.safari and a simple AppleScript to get and reopen the front tab's URL.\nGreat. However, changing the keybinding of this workflow today I discovered that it also seems to be captured by something else I set up at some point (and bound to basically the same action). With the Alfred workflow disabled, its keybinding changed, or Alfred itself quit and not running, I have verified that the Alfred version does not run, but something else is triggering the page to open in Chrome.\nI do not have FastScripts or Keyboard Maestro on this Mac. I do not see any bindings for this key in the System Preferences. I do not have /Library/KeyBindings/ or ~/Library/KeyBindings/ folders on this Mac. I don’t see any bindings in any of the areas of the Keyboard > Shortcuts preference pane. There don’t seem to be any plausibly-related Safari Extensions installed.\nShortcut Detective can detect when Alfred catches a keybinding from Safari, but sees nothing when the still-caught ^c is handled by whatever else is grabbing it.\nI can’t for the life of me figure out where else I managed to bind this shortcut, and therefore can’t figure out how to unbind it short of wiping my account.\n\nA: I've run across this post on StackOverflow that addresses this.  Basically, there's no central repository of all the shortcuts created because, in the end, the application isn't required to register the event with the system.  \nHowever, they did recommend an application (KeyCue from Ergonis, €19; Free Trial) that has the ability to find all of the shortcuts that are assigned to an application (i.e. Firefox).  I downloaded and tested the application and it seems promising.\n(Thanks to user Nimesh Neema - see comments below), you can also use CheatSheet ($0; free as in beer).  Both work in the same manner with roughly the same output (KeyCue is shown below).\nHolding down the ⌘ Command key for a couple of seconds brings up an overlay showing all of the keyboard shortcuts that are assigned to the \"front most\" App - in this case, Firefox.\n\nIf you're searching for a particular shortcut you'll have to go through each running app manually to find it.  So, as stated in the SO answer, while not perfect, this will get you close to what you're looking for. \n", "Q: Does Macbook Pro have a hardware or software issue?

However, I got a white screen in the middle of the installation! (side note; I was installing from a bootable external HDD via USB).\nAfter many tries and fails, somehow I was able to come to the final stages of installation (where you create a user name, password etc.). I entered the information and hit finish, then the computer just froze (the cursor and everything). I could not finish the installation on the main Macbook.\n-Bear with me here-\nI was not ready to give up, so I put the main Macbook into Target Disk Mode and I finished the installation on the second Macbook. Logged in, could see my fresh desktop.\nI hoped it would work just as fine on the main Macbook, but now I cannot even see the user login screen. The only thing I can see is the Apple logo and the progress bar that never finishes loading (because it gets interrupted with a white screen, it fills 3/4 approximately).\nSo my question folks, does my Macbook Pro Late 2011 have a hardware or software issue? If it is hardware, what could it be? Keep in mind that I do not have anything plugged in or changed any hardware recently.\nThanks for reading, hoping for an answer.\nCheers & stay safe!\nUPDATE: I've installed a fresh macos Sierra to an external HDD and plugged it in my main Macbook Pro, selected that drive using Option key and I still can't get past the loading bar with Apple logo (get white screen).\n\nA: You've tried replacing all the software and the issue still persists, so it sounds like a hardware issue.\nRAM is the easiest hardware to test, so I'd suggest running memtest86+ on your Mac for a while to see if it picks up any problems.\n\nA: So, I've found the solution.\nThe problem was not about the SSD nor RAM. The dGPU is the problem. As I was doing my research about people having similar issues with 2011 Macbook Pros, I've came across this fix: http://dosdude1.com/gpudisable/\nApparently, the AMD graphics processors that Apple decided to put in 2011 Macbook Pros 15\" and 17\" are doomed to die and Apple is not repairing them any more (since it means a logic board replacement). So, the easy solution is a software fix. Just follow dosdude1's instructions from the link above and after you disable the dGPU, the computer would boot normally.\nDon't forget, it is not a permanent fix. There is a physical chip that you can solder to the main board called Tiresias the GPUkiller (http://www.cmizapper.com/install/tiresias-820-2915.html), but if you don't have soldering skills, my advice would be sticking to the software fix. Keep in mind that dosdude1's fix would work until you reset the SMC/NVRAM (hope you'll never need to do that, but if you do, use dosdude1's fix again).\nHope my answer could help other Macbook Pro 2011 owners, since every devices' dGPUs are doomed to die some day.\nCheers & stay safe out here!\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13\" 2019 won't display @ 75hz with 3800 x 1600 resolution (Acer XR382CQK) I have my MacBook Pro hooked up to the display via the Apple Thunderbolt 3 cable.\nHowever, the refresh rate is locked to 30hz, despite the monitor supporting a 75hz refresh rate at its native resolution.\n\nA: I've seen this issue come up all over the internet so I decided to do a QA with a solution I stumbled upon by chance\nDisabling USB 3.0 allows me to use the monitor at 75hz.\nThis only affects peripherals plugged into the monitor dock.\nOn the XR382CQK the option is under Menu > System > USB 3.0\nI haven't had a chance to explore why this is (my theory is something with bandwidth limits) but turning USB 3.0 off allows up to the full 75hz refresh rate to be used, meanwhile turning it on instantly downgrades the refresh rate to 30hz again.\n", "Q: Mac keeps warning me about the battery problem on the top bar My Mac (2017 12' MacBook) keeps me warning about the battery problem when I tap on the battery icon on the top bar. It showed battery repair (the exact English phrase might be different) with a warning icon.\nHowever, I'm not sure what is the problem of the battery in my MacBook. Currently, the battery cycle is 829 and the manufacture date is 2017-06-19. Is it just that the battery is consumed too much and Apple encourages me to change to a new one or is there a serious problem with the battery?\nIf there is a real problem, how can I detect it and what should I do? The battery swap is quite costly (over $100) so I would rather like to avoid it (well, I'm fine with buying a new laptop but the problem is Apple ditched 12' MacBook).\n\nA: When you see the \"Replace Battery\" warning icon, it's because your Mac has detected an issue with the battery and it needs to be replaced.  You can continue to use your Mac with no problem, but understand as the battery degrades, you'll get less and less charge meaning you'll be tethered to a wall outlet more and more.   The only time you really need to worry is if the battery starts to swell. \nThis is based on information it's getting back from the battery's on board chip that stores information like cycle count, current maximum charge, the initial maximum charge, etc. as well as measurements and calculations the MacBook is doing.\n\nCurrently, the battery cycle is 829 and the manufacture date is 2017-06-19.\n\nThis is normal.  Batteries have a lifespan of about 1000 cycles and a life of 3 to 5 years.  This one is a bit on the early side of the curve, but not unexpected.  These numbers are derived from testing and modeling - there's no way to say that a battery is guaranteed 1000 cycles and exactly 4 years of life.  \n\nIs it just that the battery has consumed too much and Apple encourages me to change to a new one or is there a serious problem on the battery?\n\nNo.  Apple doesn't \"encourage\" you to change your battery after a specified amount of time/cycles.  You're getting this because the battery is no longer capable of supplying the amount of charge as spec'd out by Apple.  \nWhat could cause it?\n\n\n*\n\n*failing/defective battery cell\n\n*buildup of the SEI layer (normal wear)\n\n*exposure to temperature extremes\n\n*physical damage\n\n\nWhat is it exactly?  It's impossible to know.  We don't have the ability to \"peer into\" the battery pack and look at all the conditions in there (well, we do in the lab, but not in the computer).  The best we can do is take some measurements and make an educated guess - that's what the computer is doing when you get the battery health info.\nReplacing the Battery\nTypically Apple (and ASRs) will replace the entire top case of the MacBook.  However, if you have some technical skill (or know someone who does) and some patience, you can replace the battery itself; iFixit.com has excellent instructions\n", "Q: System Preferences freezes when I go to \"Security & Privacy\" I'm in the process of migrating from Mojave (on the internal HDD) to Catalina (on an external SSD).\nUnder Catalina, if I try to go to \"Security & Privacy\" in System Preferences, it hangs, and becomes unresponsive until I Force-Quit it.\nI've seen suggestions specific to other System Preferences panes hanging, under different macOS releases, but not specific to Catalina or to \"Security & Privacy.\"\n\nNEW 4/28/2020\nI finally found the time to try a \"safe mode\" boot on the Catalina side today. At least, I think it was a safe mode boot -- it didn't say anything about safe mode, the way it does for recovery mode. I held the shift key while the switchover was in progress, up to the point where it asked for my password (both load-source drives, i.e., both the internal HDD and the external SSD, are encrypted), and then held it for quite a while after giving it my password.\nIt asked for my password a second time, just before the desktop came up, and the secondary screen did not come up (thereby dumping a s---load of icons onto the main screen desktop).\nAttempting to go to \"security and privacy\" in System Preferences still threw up a pinwheel mouse-pointer. While it was doing that, I tried Disk First Aid. It was then that I realized that whatever was locking up System Preferences was also eating up lots of CPU time: performance was extremely sluggish just navigating to Disk Utilities. Once Disk Utilities came up, it showed both \"SanDisk SSD\" and \"SanDisk SSD - Data\"; I ran Disk First Aid on both of them. It appears to have found nothing.\nA symptom I failed to mention before, but which may be related\nWhen shutting down on the Catalina side (and this has been happening for about as long as the System Preferences lockup, again only on the Catalina side), Firefox will refuse to shut down unless forced. In fact, as I recall, if I'm on the Catalina side, Firefox will come up without my explicitly launching it. Even if I explicitly closed it before shutting down. Could this be a piece of the puzzle?\n\nA: First, try booting Safe Mode. This allows your Mac to check itself for issues. The way to do this is reboot and press Shift.\nIf that doesn't work, try running First Aid in Disk Utility.\nIf that doesn't work, try reinstalling macOS from the Recovery partition.\nWhat do you mean by migrating? You can just install macOS Catalina on the USB drive and then use Migration Assistant to transfer data from your Mac to the USB with macOS Catalina. Since you are running macOS Mojave, you will need to first install macOS Mojave on the USB. Then, you can update to Catalina.\nGood luck!\n\nA: The Catalina updater runs a critical firmware update.  The install method you describe has bypassed the firmware update.  As suggested elsewhere, install Mojave on external drive, boot from the drive ( holding Option at boot time is my preferred method), and run updater.\nThere was also a critical firmware update with High Sierra that Apple requires for Mojave.  If you managed to bypass that upgrade and went directly from Sierra to Mojave, you may want to ask a new question how to accomplish that.  (One would hope the Catalina upgrade will supersede the old firmware, I can't say.)\n\nA: Bottom line, I am abandoning this whole experiment. This Mac will remain on its internal HDD forever, and it will remain on Mojave forever. Period.\nI never should have trusted an external device as a load-source. This Mac is too mission-critical. If it were up to me, the INTERNAL load-source would be a mirrored pair of drives that are individually rated for use in human life support applications.\nThis week, I finally had a chance to try formatting the SSD again, from scratch, and this time doing the OS installation (Mojave, from Recovery Mode) and the migration in one swell foop. And it seemed to work.\nAt first.\nThen, following the migration, and the re-establishment of FileVault on the SSD, it crashed three times in under an hour, and the third time, it refused to reboot until I physically unplugged the SSD, in order to force it back to the internal HDD.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2015's screen flashes up and down I got my Mid-2105 15\" MacBook Pro a year or two back. It worked great, and I even got a free battery replacement from Apple. However a few days ago it was dropped on the floor. At first, the Mac was not taking touch pad input and most of the keyboard (although at least some functions keys worked) wasn't working, even after restarting.  \nHowever, a bit later the keyboard and touch pad started working again. At that point I noticed that the screen was \"flashing\". Basically the image on the display would randomly flash to some point below on the screen, then flash back to it's normal position, and so on. This flashing happens as soon as the Apple logo is displayed at startup, and applies even to the dead battery logo. \nI Googled the symptoms, but all of the results seemed to be for software issues, not hardware. I might've gone to the Genius bar, but they're all closed due to the pandemic, and with everyone quarantined at home, now is not a great time for the computer to not function. \nI also noticed that when you look closely, there are also random pixels that get turned on to full brightness after the screen flashes.\nSo please, if anyone has any idea of went wrong or how to fix it, I'd really appreciate it. I do have some very basic experience in opening up mobile devices, so if a fix isn't too far out of my realm I might give at try. \nHere is a video of the problem in action.\n\nA: \nBasically the image on the display would randomly flash to some point below on the screen, then flash back to it's normal position, and so on. This flashing happens as soon as the apple logo is displayed at startup, and applies even to the dead battery logo. \n\nThis is a hardware issue - it's likely the LCD or back light is damaged in some way.  If you're seeing this on startup that means it's happening prior to software being (fully) loaded.\n\n... a few days ago it was dropped on the floor. \n\nThat would be the cause.  I've seen this (well variations of this) numerous times.  The best way to confirm this is to \"remove\" the LCD from the equation - plug in an external monitor.  If there's no flashing there, it's the LCD.\nFix\nYou need to replace the LCD. It may be the back light, but I doubt it. You'll need an LCD Assembly.  iFixit.com has an excellent step by step guide on replacing it.  If this is not your cup of tea, I definitely recommend taking/sending it in for repair.

Any help as to how I can move forward would be appreciated.\n\nA: The macOS Catalina change the default Unix shell to zsh (pronounced zee...shell).\nThe .zshrc is the place that is similar to .bash_profile and .bashrc in the bash shell.\nBefore we start this, make sure your terminal is in zsh, otherwise change to zsh with chsh -s /bin/zsh command.\nIn your default directory\n# nano .zshrc\nType the following:\nPROMPT=\"%d\"\nThen run the profile\n# source .zshrc\nHere you go, got your prompt with only the current directory in your zsh prompt.\nHere is my setup : PROMPT=\"%d: %h-->\"\nWhich put a current directory and command history with --> in prompt.\nHere is an in-depth description of how to customize your prompt:\nhttps://scriptingosx.com/2019/07/moving-to-zsh-06-customizing-the-zsh-prompt/\nTo learn the difference of bash shell and zsh:\nhttps://sunlightmedia.org/bash-vs-zsh/\nA cool zsh prompt generation tool:\nhttps://zsh-prompt-generator.site/\n", "Q: SearchBarn / GlobalSearch Malware removal? A friend's OSX High Sierra MacBook is infected with some sort of malware that is hijacking the search engine. \nInstead of going to https://google.com (the selected search engine in Safari) when searching, it is briefly load searchbarn.com before redirecting to a fake bing or yahoo search result page.\nAll of the websites or articles I have found relating to removing searchbarn have been malware themselves.\nHow do you remove this malware?\n\nA: To find and delete the malware, check the running process list in Activity Monitor (or ps aux from the command line). In my case, there were several process running under root named \"GlobalSearch\", and variants thereof.\nBy taking the process id (also known as pid. e.g. value 305) and executing lsof -p 305 I could see which files on the file system were being accessed.\nThis pointed me to a python script which was located in /var/root/.GlobalSearch - a hidden folder under the root user. \nsudo rm -rf /var/root/.GlobalSearch deletes the hidden folder and all of it's contents.\nAt this point, the processes disappeared from Activity Monitor, however Safari (and other system apps) were unable to access the internet. \nI then found that this malware had setup a socks proxy in order to send all web traffic to the python script. Open System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced -> Proxies and uncheck the Socks Proxy checkbox.\nI believe the attack vector was a fake Adobe Flash updater which tricked the user into typing in their admin password after downloading the installer. \nEDIT: I also ran EtreCheck which found several files that I missed.

My login script is behaving oddly since I moved to Catalina.  Particularly this line:\n# set cursor to display path and command count\nPS1=\"<: \\w | \\! :> \"\n\nNow my cursor actually has a \\w and a \\! in it.  Before in my older Mac from about 4 years ago it would show the path and command count.\nAlso this command stopped working:\nhistory -c\n\nand gives an error.\nI looked at the default shell using\necho $SHELL\n\nand it gave\n/bin/zsh\n\nand the current shell using\necho $0\n\nand it gave\n-zsh\n\n\nA: \nDid the shell ( terminal ) change in Catalina?\n\nThese are two completely different things that have nothing to do with each other, so let's address them separately:\n\nDid the terminal change in Catalina?\n\nNo. There might have been updates (although I don't think so), but there have not been any fundamental changes.\n\nDid the shell change in Catalina?\n\nCatalina still ships with the same shells that High Sierra did. There were probably some updates (I haven't checked), but no updates that fundamentally change the behavior of the shells. Also, there were no new shells added and no shells removed.\nThe one thing that has changed, is the default interactive login shell for newly-created user accounts, which is now Zsh instead of Bash. The reason for that is that macOS ships with a really old version of Bash, because Apple doesn't want to ship code under the GPLv3, so they ship the last version of Bash that is still under the GPLv2. Thus, Apple is trying to move users away from Bash, at least for interactive use.\nNote, that this applies only to\n\n\n*\n\n*the interactive login shell for a user, other shells are unchanged, \n\n*the default, the user or administrator can still change it if they wish, \n\n*newly-created user accounts, existing accounts will not be migrated automatically.\n\n\nIt is not quite clear why and how your login shell was changed to Zsh. That shouldn't have happened. It should only be changed for newly-created accounts, not for existing ones.\n\n# set cursor to display path and command count\nPS1=\"<: \\w | \\! :> \"\n\nNow my cursor actually has a \\w and a \\! in it. Before in my older Mac from about 4 years ago it would show the path and command count.\n\nThat snippet has nothing to do with the cursor. It changes the prompt. The cursor doesn't even have anything to do with the shell, it is managed by the terminal emulator.\nThe equivalent Zsh prompt escape sequences to the Bash ones you showed, would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*%d / %/: current working directory\n\n*alternatively %~: current working directory; if the path starts with the home directory, replace the prefix with ~\n\n*%h / %!: current history event number\n\n\nA: Yes. You were probably using bash shell. Catalina changed to zsh.\n\nA: Your shell has been changed to Zsh, which is the default for new users on Catalina (10.15) and later. To go back to the old shell (BASH), run chsh -s /bin/bash (chsh is a \"Change Shell command, the -s flag is \"set\", and /bin/bash is the location of the BASH shell). Then close and re-open terminal, or log out and log back in, and your shell will be bash again.\nAlternatively, if you want to use the GUI, open System Preferences, Users and Groups, unlock the padlock at the bottom left, and control-click or right click on your user. Then, select \"Advanced Options.\" There should be an entry called \"Login Shell\", which you can set back to /bin/bash.\nSource: How to set shell in OS X - Super User\n", "Q: macOS Catalina - External Hard Drive not sleeping when lid closed and laptop sleeping So I'm trying to figure out why my external hard drive remains on (light displaying) when the laptop is sleeping.\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*macos 10.15.3\n\n*macbook pro \n\n\nenergy saver\n\n\n*\n\n*disabled > Enable Power Nap while on battery power disabled in battery and power adapter\n\n*enabled > Put hard disks to sleep when possible in battery and power adapter\n\n\nA: The LED on your USB external drive probably just indicates that it is connected to power.\nThe MacBook Pro provides connected USB devices with at least 0.50 watts of power (according to the USB power specification and Apple technote HT204377) even when the laptop has been put to sleep.

However, do so has been known to work.\n\nYou should make sure Secure Boot is set to detect and boot from external drives.\n\nYou should first determine if the external drive is using a GUID partition table (GPT) or a MBR partition table. This can be done by looking at the output from the command diskutil list. If you see GUID_partition_scheme for the drive, then the drive is using a GPT. If you see FDisk_partition_scheme, the the drive is using a MBR partition table. \nIf the drive is using a GPT, then the Mac Startup Manager should detected the boot files on the external drive. Detection of the boot files does not guarantee the Mac will be able to boot Windows. For example, there may be drivers that need to be added to the drivers store. This can be done using the Windows 10 installation media.\nYour model Mac can not boot from Windows installed on disk that is using a MBR partition table. If the drive is using MBR partitioning, then there is not enough information posted in your question to tell if the partitioning can be converted to use a GPT. If not, then you might be able to use a third party partitioning tool to make room for adding a GPT. After converting to use a GPT, the UEFI boot file files will need to be added to the drive. Also, you probably should add the drivers from the Window Support Software. This can be done using the Windows 10 installation media.\nUpdate 1: Create an Empty EFI Partition\n\nThe EFI partition is where the Windows boot files are stored.\n\nYou can going to need a EFI partition. You can use disk2s1 for this. Below are the steps to backup this volume.\ncd ~/Desktop\ndiskutil unmountDisk disk2\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk2s1 of=backup2s1.bin\n\nNext, reformat the partition.\nsudo diskutil FAT32 EFI disk2s1\n\nFinally, use gdisk to change the partition type of disk2s1 from 0700 to EF00\nUpdate 2: Create a USB bootable Windows 10 flash drive installer.\n\nYou will need to boot from the flash drive in order to run the commands to create the boot files and transfer the drivers to the driver store.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Disk Utility to erase a USB flash drive. Use the name WINSTALL, format ExFAT and scheme Master Boot Record.\n\n*Download the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft. This is free and you do not need a product key.\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software.\n\n*Mount the Windows 10 ISO and copy all the files to the flash drive.\n\n*Copy all the Windows Support Software files to the flash drive. The $WinPEDriver$, BootCamp and (Optional) AutoUnattend.xml files should appear in the root folder of the flash drive.\n\n\nUpdate 3: Install the Boot Files and the Drivers\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot From the USB flash drive. When the first window appears, enter a shift+F10 to open a Command Prompt window.\n\n*Use the diskpart command to determine the drive letters for the Windows WINSTALL volumes. (i.e. enter list volume) Here, I will assume the letters are C and D, respectively. Also, assign the EFI volume the drive letter S. See diskpart for more information.\n\n*Enter the following command to create the boot files. If needed, substitute your Windows drive letter for the letter C. See bcdboot for more information.\nbcdboot C:\\Windows /s S: /f UEFI\n\n\n*Add the drivers to the drivers store. Often this step can be omitted. If needed, substitute your Windows drive letter for the letter C and your WINSTALL drive letter for the letter D. See dism for more information.\ndism /Image:C:\\ /Add-Driver /Driver:D:\\$WinPEDriver$ /Recurse  /ForceUnsigned\n\n\nYou can ignore any error messages produced.\n\n\n*If you succeed in booting Windows, install the Windows Support Software.\n", "Q: Where to find list of downloads in Safari 13.1 for macOS Mojave? I am using Safari 13.1 on macOS Mojave.\nThe Downloads icon button in the upper-right corner of Safari's toolbar is now gone. The Customize Toolbar feature does not offer any such widget.\nIs there some other way to see a list of recent downloads and where they went?\n\nA: Open Safari Preferences window (by going to Safari Menu bar → Preferences... or using the keyboard shortcut Command + ,), go to the General tab and check if Remove download list items: is set to Upon successful download.\n\nIf yes, then the Download button is shown in the Safari toolbar (towards the right end of the Address and Search bar) as long as one or more download tasks are in progress. As soon as the last active download task completes, the Download button is automatically removed from the toolbar.\nThe Show Downloads command is also greyed out under the View menu if the Downloads button is not visible in the toolbar.\nTo view the button, you can change the Remove download list items: setting to a different desirable value.\n\nA: The downloads button will not be there, when there are no more downloads in the list.  The reference to your download probably aged off, based on your selection for download list removal in settings (Referenced in the prior post from Nimesh Neema).  Where they went is also in the settings   ... under \"File download location\".  By default this will be \"Downloads\", but you may have selected \"Ask for each download\", in which case, it would be wherever you put it.  You can open finder to find your downloads.  I suspect it will be in the default which is \"Downloads\", which should be a separate category on the left of Finder.  You can sort by date by clicking on the \"Date added\" column, or similarly sort by name by clicking on the \"Name\" column.  That should help you find your download.\n", "Q: What is the difference between the different font smoothing levels on macOS? In, macOS 10.14 and 10.15 (and in older versions), you can enable font smoothing and set the font smoothing strength on the command line. See this for reference. Key commands are \ndefaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool FALSE\ndefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 3\n// the \"3\" here represents strong font smoothing.\n\nYou can also set this using the TinkerTool app.\nPersonally I prefer the strong smoothing even on my retina Mac Book Pro. \nCould someone explain the technical details behind the three different levels of smoothing : light, medium, strong. I believe this works differently from freetype rendering because Mac prefers to maintain the original glyph shapes, which is a good thing! \nHow is this font smoothing different from colored subpixel - in TinkerTool this is the Enforce the old style font smoothing if possible (colored sub-pixels option). I noticed that if you enable this option, fonts think out a bit and become more crisp but in some apps you can see the sharp pixel edges if you look very carefully. \nI'm trying to get an overall understanding of the different font smoothing approaches in macOS. \n\nA: I think I've found the most reasonable explanation for how Font Smoothing works in macOS here.\nNoting some of the good observations from that thread.\nSub-pixel rendering in Mojave (M) doesn't work the same way it does in High Sierra (HS). Specifically, in HS, gray base text most stays dark gray, with colored pixels get added around it when you enable sub-pixel rendering. In Mojave, much of the base text is changed from gray to other, lighter colors, thus reducing contrast. As much of Apple's menu text is gray rather than black, this effect reduces contrast throughout the OS.\nIn Mojave, font smoothing doesn't actually make the letters thicker (i.e., it doesn't darken more pixels). Rather, it makes the darkened pixels darker, thus giving the appearance of added thickness.\nThese observations should apply to macOS Catalina as well.\n", "Q: Why is my time machine backup so large after updating from OSX 10.13.6 to 10.15.4? Yesterday, I took my 2015 Macbook Pro running OSX 10.13.6 and backed it up using Time Machine to an external hard drive. I then immediately updated my laptop to 10.15.4. I plugged in my external hard drive to do back it up again using Time Machine, and the subsequent backup was over 70GB(!).  Looking at About This Mac -> Storage, I currently have an 256GB SSD, with 84GB of Photos, 78GB of documents, 18GB of Music, 7GB of Apps, 11GB of System, 16GB of other.  \nI can not figure out why this backup was so enormous.  What did Apple change so significantly over the past two operating system iterations? I know they dropped 32bit support for applications from 10.13 -> 10.14.  Could this be why this backup to be so large? \nMy cloud backup service (SpiderOak One), also decided that it needed to backup 40GB of stuff. It looks like its doing mostly photos in Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals, but likewise I don't see why it would need to do this.  I have it running constantly and I believe it was working and up to date prior to this backup.  \nI believe that these two issues are related. Perhaps Apple changed its file system yet again (like from 10.12 -> 10.13, where it changed  to AFS)?  Maybe it changed how it handles Photos?\nQuestion:\n1. Why was my Time Machine and SpiderOak backups so large?  The only thing I did was update my operating system.\n\nA: First off I can definitely say that the large backup is not caused by the drop of support for 32-bit applications, nor is it due to yet another change of file system from APFS to \"something new\" (note that Apple used HFS+ for ~20 years before moving to APFS, so file system changes are definitely not done often).\nOne of the big changes that comes with the update from 10.13 to 10.15 is ofcourse the operating system files themselves. Most of them have changed in some way, so that contributes a lot to the difference. Also Catalina split system and other data over two volumes (while preserving a unified view) so that to a backup system some files could seemingly have moved around.\nI can't immediately find a reason for Photos to have made changes to your originals. I would suggest comparing one or two photos in the backups from before and after your upgrade to find the differences - perhaps there has been some kind of meta data change, but I haven't experienced that when upgrading to Catalina.\nIn general you can use a tool such as BackupLoupe to examine the Time Machine backup made just after upgrading to figure out, which files were changed/moved and made the backup larger.\nAnother tool that can be used is GrandPerspective, which will visualise the data taking up space in the backup, allowing to you get a high level overview of what taking up the most space.\n", "Q: How to disable long press Caps Lock feature in Mac keyboard? There is a feature in Mac keyboard, where keeping the Caps Lock key held for over a second or so, the light will turn on and will change some behavior of input method.\nWhat I want is totally disable this feature, even pressing Caps Lock for a longer duration, the light won't turn on, and don't change other behavior. \nI only want to disable \"press and hold\" feature, my main language isn't English, so I need that feature tap to switch language, but I don't want 'press and hold' feature\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences app → Keyboard → Input Sources and uncheck the checkbox against the setting that reads Use the Caps Lock key to switch to and from language.\n\nThis should disable the feature and get the behavior you are looking for.\n\nA: This is only a partial answer to your question.\nYou can disable the built-in behaviour of the Caps Lock key so that the light won't turn on, and it won't make your typing all uppercase, no matter whether you tap it or hold it down. After making this change the Caps Lock key will do nothing at all, and that means it won't switch input sources either.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Open the Keyboard Preferences\n\n*Press the button for \"Modifier Keys...\"\n\n*Select Keyboard \"Apple Internal Keyboard\"\n\n*Change \"Caps Lock (⇪) Key\" to \"No Action\".\n\n\n\nI understand this isn't quite you want -- you want Caps Lock to be used only for switching languages, never for uppercase text.

I use a bash script (myJavaBash.sh) within an Application Bundle (myJavaJar.app), that starts \"java -jar myJarFile.jar\" with additional JVM arguments (which works fine so far). My goal is to pass a file name as argument to the application, too, whenever the user opens a file via \"open with ... myJavaJar.app\".\nEdit: to clarify: I do not pass arguments to the bash script.

If you are using osascript inside another script, you can just use the arguments you already have - expanding variables in a heredoc, for example.\nThe following example will use arguments from the command line, or if none, from an array defined in the shell script.

My monitors are 2 Ausus VG278Q.\nI tried different docks. Latest one (which I believee was my best shot) is a Belkin Thunderbolt 2 Expresss Dock HD. \nLater I found out that the Mid 2012 don't support more than 1 external monitor at all. \nIs there any solution to that problem ?\nI've seen this other question: Will the Macbook Air (Mid 2012) support dual monitors?\nMy understanding is that your monitors need to be have a thunderbolt 2 entry, so you can daisy chain then. Is my understanding correct? If that is the case mini DP entries are enough or it needs to be really Thunderbolt 2 ? This is already old technology and having to buy monitors to fit this requisite is quite limiting and very likely not future proof.\nAny other solutions?  \n\nA: The only monitor that can daisy-chain the display connection is the Apple Thunderbolt Display. Your Asus monitors don't have Thunderbolt hubs or 'pass-through' connectivity.\nHowever, I'm surprised that the Belkin Dock didn't work: assuming that it had a HDMI port and a TB2 pass-through, then that's exactly what it's for. \nThere are TB2 to dual HDMI adaptors, which might work, if you can find one.\nhttps://www.techpowerup.com/149981/zotac-announces-dual-hdmi-output-adaptors\nIf you really want to invest in 'future-proofing', you might be better served updating your Mac. \n\nA: Officially, Apple states that both the 2012 and 2013 MacBook Air will only support a single external display.  However if you’re using Thunderbolt (not DisplayPort) you can daisy chain two monitors together.\nThunderbolt is not mDP (mini DisplayPort); DisplayPort is a protocol/signal carried on the Thunderbolt port (it’s a subset of TB).  So, it’s not the same thing and there’s only so much DisplayPort bandwidth supplied.\nAs far as docks go, they don’t magically add display bandwidth that doesn’t already exist on your MacBook.  Remember, if it only supported one (non-Thunderbolt) display to begin with, unless you add another video adapter (like a USB video adapter), you’re still limited to one.\nAs for future proofing, you really can do this.  Thunderbolt 1 and 2 are obsolete so what was current in 2013 is superseded in 2015 (TB2)and then that was subsequently obsolete in 2017 (TB3).\nYour best bet (to “Future proof”) is to purchase high quality 4K or 5K monitors with DisplayPort and/or ThunderBolt connectivity.  You visually can’t see more than 4K so anything past that is actually a waste.

A few months ago I replaced the internal HD with an SSD. Everything worked fine. A new SATA cabled was also put in place.\nRecently however the laptop had some issues. First, when pressing a certain area on the case, it would reboot. However, after rebooting I could work with it again as if nothing has happend. A few days later, it would again shut down, but then make 3 beeps while attempting to reboot. As several sources online state, this means faulty RAM. Intuitively I just tried to reboot again and the MBP worked just fine. My gf told me that there were cases where the diplays showed some glitches. Right now the situation got worse and the laptop cannot be used anymore. It boots, but then the \"spinning coloured ball\" occurrs. The laptop responds extremely slow. Finder cannot be opened, etc. \nOne more thing: She just told me that a few weeks ago she switched on the laptop with the power cable connected because the battery was empty. She then noticed some sort of \"short circuit\" when connected the cable. There was a tiny flash and it was as if something \"burned\". The funny thing is just that I would expect that the laptop immediately stops working. However it worked fine afterwards, but (obviously) slowly deteriorated as described above.\nOther things I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I run Apple diagnostics. It said there could be an issue with the battery. I then did it again with power cable attached and it said there are no problems.\n\n*I removed both memory sticks (one by one) to ensure that none of them are faulty. With only one of them in use, the system behaved in the same erroneous way.\n\n\nSo what whould I do now? Can I do anything at all or should I go to a technician? Which  faulty hardware could be responsible for the described behavior?\nUPDATE: A short update: I bought a Samsung 850 EVO 500GB (see here:  https://www.amazon.de/Samsung-MZ-75E250B-EU-interne-schwarz/dp/B00P73B1E4?th=1). Actually, I just remembered that I did not buy the SSD. The SSD is already a bit older, but I bought a new  SATA cable, because the SSD wouldn't work internally. So I bought this cable:  https://www.amazon.de/ireplacement-A1278-Drive-Macbook-821-1480/dp/B075PZ3PK5?th=1\nWith this cable I could use the SSD internally and everything worked fine.\nUPDATE: I identified the root cause. See this thread now please: Extreme slowing down of MacBook Pro due to pkd process\n\nA: One thing that does happen at times with MacBooks of this kind (own one myself and had it happen to me) is that batteries can over time \"inflate\" and slowly but surely push themselves against something — in this case it would be weird if the something was the mainboard since it's not located under the battery but rather beneath it). But maybe you could take it apart and see if the battery looks odd or even a little blown-up and ask your friend if she ever replaced it before..?\nSome basic steps to perform:\n\n\n*\n\n*To rule out possible battery faults, you could take the battery out,\nthen try turning it on with the power cable attached\n\n*Give the obvious \"mac-things\" a try such as SMC reset, PRAM/NVRAM\nreset etc.\n\n*Take out the SSD and attach it to another computer to see if you can\nstart it up from there\n\n", "Q: A problem when changing the language There's is a problem when changing the language  on my MacBook Air, if I need to change the language I have to press ⌘+space not once, but I have to press it twice if I need to change the language from English to Arabic!\nHow can I fix this so I only have press it once?\n\nA: You might be able to fix the problem by going into system preferences > keyboard > shortcuts, and find out if any other keyboard shortcuts using ⌘+space.

Instead of mounting the \"Video\" drive (smb://HAL9000/Video) and going to a sub-folder within the video drive labeled \"GoPro -IMPORT\", it will create a new drive on their desktop labeled \"GoPro - IMPORT\".  \nIf I create a new sub-folder within \"GoPro - IMPORT\" and send them a link to that like (smb://HAL9000/Video/GoPro%20-%20IMPORT/Test), instead of taking to the sub-folder in the \"Video\" drive that they already have mounted on their desktop, it will create an entirely new drive labeled \"Test\" on their desktop.  \nI've tried reaching out to both Apple and Synology and had no luck with this.  I would appreciate any kind of help/support. \n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not how macOS works.\nSMB or Server Message Block is a Microsoft Windows technology so it stands to reason that sharing links to SMB shares (or as Microsoft calls them, network shares) is baked into the OS.  The UNC share isn't \"mounted\" like it is in Unix where \"everything's a file\".  In Windows, you can \"map\" a network drive to a share, but in Unix, you have to mount it.\nFinder and SMB\nWhen Finder \"sees\" the smb:// it invokes the mount_smbfs command behind the scenes and creates a mount point in the /Volumes/ sub-folder.  Using your example, the first time you send the link smb://HAL9000/Video, it will issue the following command:\n`mount_smbfs //domain;user:password@HAL9000/Video /Volumes/Video`\n\nIf that name exists, you will get the following path /Volumes/Video(1) and if that exists, (2) and so on.  Using my SMB mounts on a Synology Diskstation, as another example, I have the share \"Network Share\" already mounted.  When I try to mount again using \"Connect to Server\" (⌘ CommandK and just connecting directly to the server with no share specified, you can see that it's greyed out.\n\nThat's because it's already mounted.  Issuing the mount command gives us:\n$ mount\n/dev/disk2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk5s1 on /Volumes/MUSIC (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)\n/dev/disk4s2 on /Volumes/My Passport for Mac (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled)\n/dev/disk3s2 on /Volumes/FreeAgent Go (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, noowners)\n//allan@diskstation.home/Network%20Share on /Volumes/Network Share (smbfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by allan)\n\nThe last line confirms it - \"Network Share\" is already mounted and can't be mounted again.\nSo why can't I share links?\nBecause you don't access the file through smb://server-foo/share-bar/filename.txt (ignoring authentication).  You access it by going to /Volumes/Share-bar/filename.txt\nThe problem with that is /Volumes/Share-name may be completely different for you and me (see above re: existing names).  The only thing you can do is to rewrite the UNC path to let Mac users know which file you're referring to.  Example:\nWindows:  \\\\HAL9000\\Video\\GoPro - IMPORT\\filename.txt\nmacOS:    /Video/GoPro-Import/filename.txt\n\nThe user will then have to manually navigate to that share to get to the file you're referencing.\nThis is why they created WebDav because now you'll be accessing the file via a universal https:// link which is the same for everyone.  The downside is that if you intend to share with Windows clients, you'll need to implement SSL certificates.  And yes, Synology does support WebDav\n", "Q: Unable to format my memory card/SD - error -69877 couldn't open device I can't seem to able to format my PNY 32 GB SD card\nWhen I go to Disk Utility and try to erase it gives me error: Unmounting disk, Couldn't modify partition map and operation failed\nI successfully unmounted disk2 (the SD card) via terminal but when trying to erase it it shows  error -69877 couldn't open device\nI also tried command sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 bs=1024 count=1024 but it shows permission denied\nSystem: OS X El Capitan 10.11.6\nCan you help please?\n\nA: I had the same problem, but per this Mac Forum discussion, SanDisk Micro-SD to SD Adapters has a 'Lock\" slider that is easy to miss.

The shebang line tells the computer which executable program should be used to interpret the rest of the script. In this case you're writing a bash script, but you could just as easily be writing a script for python or awk, and you need to tell the system which interpreter to use based on what language the script is written in.\nThe reason that your shebang line #! bin/bash doesn't work is because you haven't provided a valid path (typically, an absolute path) to the interpreter. If you omit the initial slash / then the shell looks for bin in the current working directory but doesn't find it.\nSince you're just getting started learning bash, I suggest reading a book. This will save you from having to ask too many questions. Learning the bash Shell, 3rd Edition by Cameron Newham is quite good.\n", "Q: Changing Adaptive Undo Shortcut in System Preferences I am aware that one can go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts, and easily change any menu bar shortcut, like Undo, for all applications.

Now that I'm writing this, it is currently Behdad's iPad (543), which has been changed from Behdad's iPad (284) from yesterday!\n\n\nA few points to consider:\nIt all started when I installed YazFi package on my ASUS RT-AC87U router with Asuswrt-Merlin 384.13_2 firmware on it and my current network configuration is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*I have two networks, one is 192.168.1.0/24 and another is 192.168.2.0/24.\n\n*All my devices occasionally connect to any of those networks, including my iPhone and my MacBook Pro.\n\n*This naming thing happens on both my iPad and MacBook Pro (but not to this extent, as it is currently sitting on `Behdad's MacBook Pro (7)\", but not to my iPhone.\n\nDo you have any idea on why this happens and how can I make it stop? I'm worried it messes something with iCloud, as these names appear on my iCloud device list.\n\nA: This does not mess up iCloud devices, the device is getting the name from the router and reporting it. As soon as you rename the device or fix the network to assign a different name, iCloud will reflect the current names quickly.\n\nIt definitely is made worse by YazFi, because since I uninstalled it from my router, all my devices have kept their names. I'm going to ask its developer also. This can happen on any network, however with bonjour sleep proxy and dns/dhcp not cleaning old records at the same rate as iOS devices reconnect after sleep.\nYazFi's developer had asked people to reply to a thread in SmallNetBuilders forum regarding any issues. Several others created accounts there, but looks new users need to gain a few points to be able to post on the forums (similar to how new users can’t comment here without reputation or make edits without approval).\nGetting enough momentum posting on SNB forums to link to this question might help others see it.\nEditors note: this answer came from edits to the question so I moved it to the answer. I encourage others to put up a better answer or edit this as needed.\n\nA: I can't add a comment...but I'm the YazFi developer.

As of writing this the latest version is 4 and I haven't had this problem with YazFi 4. So if you have this issue on YazFi 3, update to version 4. I hope this helps.\nUpdate: 7 months later and I can confirm YazFi 4 fixes the problem.\n", "Q: Can't grant Input Monitoring permission to Wacom drivers on macOS Catalina To preface, I am a procrastinator at updating my laptop. I just updated to macOS Catalina and I want to throw something at it.\nMy laptop: MacBook, Retina 12 inch, Early 2015; 1.1GHz Dual-Core Intel Core M; 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nRunning Catalina version 10.15.4\nSo my laptop is a 2015 MacBook. Previously running Mojave with Photoshop CS6 and a 2018 Wacom Intuos. Drivers up to date. No issues whatsoever, ran like a dream. \nI just updated to Catalina which was apparently a huge mistake. First, CS6 no longer functions. Frustrating, but I upgraded to Creative Cloud and it’s fine. My tablet started lagging to the point where it was virtually useless. The drivers were newest version but I figured something hadn’t synced right. So I completely wiped Wacom and set it up brand new, new drivers, etc.\nWell if I thought updating was dumb, that was even dumber. Catalina’s security upgrades require apps to ask permission in order to read keystrokes, which is required for Wacom’s drivers, I learned today. \nBut it never asked for permission. So I went to manually add it via Input Monitoring and it doesn’t show up. Nothing shows up. It won’t let me manually add it. Research states that in order for you to add anything to Input Monitoring, you have to have an app that’s already requested permission in the list. I’ve tried installing, uninstalling, and reinstalling various apps that are supposed to ask permission but nothing is requesting keystroke access. Which is where I’m stuck.\nIs there a way to force an app to request it again? I've set and reset permissions a dozen times, wiped and installed old driver versions, wiped and reinstalled new drivers, nothing is working. It keeps telling me I need to add Wacom to Input Monitoring but it won't request permission. \n\nA: Unfortunately this problem affects everyone installing Wacom drivers on macOS Catalina, but at least there is a workaround. (Skip to Workaround at the end of this answer if you don't care about the explanation.)\n\nHow it's supposed to work\nThe way it's supposed to work on macOS Catalina is that you receive a permission prompt (like this one shown below) when you first use an application that needs to use Input Monitoring. But for some reason, the Wacom drivers never cause this dialog to appear.\n\nWhy Wacom's instructions don't work\nWacom has at least acknowledged the issue, but as you have discovered their instructions are incomplete! They say to drag WacomTabletDriver and WacomTouchDriver into the Input Monitoring list, but that's impossible on a stock installation of macOS Catalina because the list isn't even shown.\nThe list will never be shown, and the + button will be missing, until some other application requests Input Monitoring permissions.\nWorkaround\nYou'll need to install and activate at least one other application that can use Input Monitoring before you can finish setting up the Wacom drivers. Once you have the Wacom drivers working, you can remove any other applications you don't want to keep using. Here are some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*CheatSheet is a small free utility program that's easy to install, and it's easy to quit/uninstall afterward.\n\n*ColorSnapper2 is another option. It's not free, but the trial version is enough to get the Input Monitoring prompt.\n\n*Discord - A popular chat platform.\n\n*Klokki.app - I've seen others use this.\n\n*BetterTouchTool can create the AEServer entry that is shown in the Wacom instructions.\n\n*Karabiner-Elements helps to configure custom key bindings.\n\n\nOther cases\nYou're not the only person to be affected. I found a couple other cases here on Ask Different: 1 2 3 4. And on some other sites like Reddit and Apple Communities.\n\nA: This is a pain in the ass :-) I know this has already been answered but for reference I'm adding some additional points which helped me get this working!\nLet's hope Wacom fixes this at some point to make it more user friendly!\nFIRST: Read Wacom's instructions for installing on Mac OS 10.15 Catalina.\nI found the drivers were in a hidden folder called .Tablet under:\n/Applications/Wacom Tablet/\n\nTo locate them open Finder:\n\n*\n\n*Menu: Go > Go to Folder...\n\n*Keyboard shortcut: Shift + Command + G (⇧ + ⌘ + G) to reveal/hide hidden files.\n\nTo enable hidden files, use:\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard shortcut: In Finder press Shift + Command + Period (⇧ + ⌘ + .) to reveal/hide hidden files.\n\n*Terminal: In Terminal type defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles true; killall Finder; and press return (switch true to false to reverse this).\n\n*App: Download TinkerTool and check Show hidden and system files on the Finder tab (TinkerTool let's you configure various system settings via a UI).\n\nOnce you've added visited Apple menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy> Privacy and added the appropriate apps/drivers to the list you need to log out and back in after each change (or restart).\nOnce I had everything showing correctly I still had the annoying pop-up \"Security settings prevented the Wacom Software from posting an event\". If that happens do this:\n\n*\n\n*Go back to Apple menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy> Privacy\n\n*Select Accessibility, unlock the list (click on the lock at the bottom) and uncheck the com.Wacom.IOManager\n\n*Log out and log back in.\n\n*Go back to the Accessibility list and the com.Wacom.IOManager once more.\n\n\nIf you need to install a 3rd-party app to trigger the lists in the Security & Privacy settings:\nAn app that requests permission for Accessibility:\nRectangle — Move and resize windows in macOS using keyboard shortcuts or snap areas \nA couple of apps that request permission for Input Monitoring:\nOBS — Free and open source software for video recording and live streaming\nLastPass — Password manager\n", "Q: Keyboard lag, lost keystrokes, and high fan speed in Filevault's EFI pre-boot unlock/login screen (MacBook Pro 2017) I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) with macOS 10.15.4 and FileVault enabled.\nWhen I boot the machine, the Filevault's pre-boot unlock screen appears as normal, prompting me for my password.\nNow, while the system remains on this screen, and all the way until the correct password is recognized, the following symptoms occur:\n\n\n*\n\n*Built-in fans start spinning at top speed within seconds from boot (which, I assume, indicate high CPU use).\n\n*Built-in keyboard very noticeably lags: key inputs are buffered before actually appearing in the password text field and some of them are disregarded altogether.\n\n\nNow, this presents a very practical problem: sometimes it takes me more than 10 attempts to actually get my password to be recognized.\nEven worse, with each mangled password the screen almost seem to work slower and slower, all very reminiscent of high-CPU-load situations.\nI usually type my password fairly quickly, but any other password prompt within the OS takes it without a hiccup. And even when I slow down, lost keystrokes are still a problem and are hard to detect in a password field, where actual characters are not shown.\nThe problem repeats itself between macOS installations, and is definitely not caused by system still booting up in the background: as I said, the apparent high CPU load always continues until the password is recognized and stops immediately after.\nWhat exactly does Filevault do on that screen?

That will bring up the sharing panel right away.\n\nSome additional details about screenshots if you're interested...\nAny iOS app in the foreground can detect a screenshot and react however it wants. I guess you were using some app that offered helpful sharing when you took a screenshot of that app specifically, but I have no idea what that might have been.\nThere are no apps** that can change the system-wide behaviour of screenshots to reveal the sharing options when you take a screenshot. iOS apps can't interfere with the system that way.\n**Actually that's not totally true.

As a result it is hard to get a proper connection, I have to jiggle it around a lot, and even when it does work it gets extremely hot now.\nThe burn is on both sides of the connection (the cable and the computer) so I can’t fix this by just getting a new cable.\nI have tried cleaning it with 70% rubbing alcohol on Q-tips as I saw recommended on another site, but it didn’t do anything at all.\nCan you recommend anything else I can try? I need this computer for work so I don’t want to send it to the repair depot to fix. Also I don’t want to do anything that would make it worse, especially since I’m still under warranty.\nThis is a mid-2015 MacBook Pro and MagSafe 2 port. Pics:\n\n\n\nA: Yes, those are definitely burnt and this is because the sand allowed a gap just large enough that the electrical current arced from the adapter to DC-In port.\nYou can't clean this with alcohol - that's actually the last step.  What you need is something that's mildly abrasive.  You may have more luck cleaning the MagSafe adapter because those are pins where as the DC-In board are four conductive \"dimples\" surrounded by the most fragile plastic you'll ever run across.\nWhat you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Solder Wick.  Take a small piece and using a blunt tool (pen, pencil, etc.) and work it back and forth like a Brillo pad.\n\n*A very tiny piece of 800 grit sand paper (tiny enough to fit inside the DC-In port indentation) and work the same was as described with the solder wick.\n\n*Make a slightly moist paste of Bar Keepers Friend and water and \"scrub\" with a cotton swab (when I say slightly I mean just shy of being dry).  \n\n\nOnce you've \"scrubbed\" the contacts, you can then use the alcohol to clean the contacts properly.  Basically, it's like cleaning \"burnt on\" anything  in the kitchen - you've got to scrub it off first, before you polish it.  Until you get it clean, it's not going to make proper contact.\nIf all else fails, the DC-In board is actually very cheap and very easy to replace.\n", "Q: How to measure the time in milliseconds from invoking the command in MacOS OSX bash until the command begins execution?

It's literally (not figuratively) every single one of your files listed alphabetically in a search window; it's nothing harmful.\n\nJust close out of the search and you'll be fine.  You might want to take a quick read of the Apple document, Get to know the Finder on your Mac.\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different. Some of them would be system files or files associated to applications installed on your Mac. It's unlikely to be malware particularly if it's a clean install. \nYou can see where these files are installed in their parent directory by enabling the path bar in Finder. You can do this by going to the toolbar and click View drop down menu and select Show Path Bar. The path bar will then be shown at the bottom of the Finder window. \nThen, when you select the file in the search results, the path bar will show you which  parent directory the file is located in. \nAlternatively you can see all the properties of the file and where it's located by using the Get Info function by selecting the file and pressing ⌘ CommandI. \nFinally, if you just want to see your Documents folder, this can be found in the left sidebar as shown in your screenshot.

My Brother DCP-7055 Printer’s two-side printing functionality does not work (the “Two-Sided” option is greyed out) on macOS Catalina 10.15.4. I have not tested it on any other versions of macOS but it works as expected on Windows. I've installed the macOS driver from the official Brother website, and the installed driver is Brother CUPS as it is stated by Brother.

I just bought a LG 34wk95u, an ultra-wide 34” monitor with 5120x2160 native resolution (named 5K2K).\nI connected my MBP 13” 2018 to it with thunderbolt.\nPlease correct me if I’m wrong, but the only way to have the maximum display quality on this kind of monitor, if to have :\n\n\n*\n\n*1:1 resolution (5120x2160) -> native resolution\n\n*or 1:2 resolution (2560x1080) -> because every pixel is x2 horizontally and x2 vertically, so the scaling is perfect.\n\n\nAs soon as we try other resolution, scaling can not be perfect, and text will be a little more blurry (this can be verified running a 4K video on the monitor, pausing on some text). Plus, as stated in macOS display settings: \"scaled resolution may affect performances\"\nThe thing is, with 1:1 resolution, everything is way too small on screen, I can't read text. But with 1:2 resolution, everything is too big (et I don’t have enough space on my desktop, 34” becomes useless).\nIf I change font sizes, I can notice 2 issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*I need to do it on every software (complicated).\n\n*If I take my mac with me to work in a coffee, or just in my bed, font sizes will be wrong on the MBP retina display.\n\n\nI don’t know what to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I keep 5120x2160 res but increase font size is every software?\n\n* Should I use 2560x1080 res and decrease font size in every software?\n\n*Should I use 3360x1417 res, having a normal size for everything, but\naccept that the display quality is lower that it should be? (at\n1100€, it hurts…)\n\n* Should I change of monitor and take one with a lower native\nresolution?\n\n\nI'll use this monitor as a software developper who wants lots of real estate to display in the same time: code, terminal, web browser, debuguer.\nThanks for sharing your experience.\n\nA: Try the 3360 x 1417 scaling mode for a while. That's exactly why it was introduced to macOS as an option -- so that HiDPI displays can actually be made usable instead of having everything tiny. No it won't be perfect, but there's no perfect answer here. After doing your regular workflow for a few days, you'll know if this mode is acceptable to you.\n\nFor desktop use, most people are comfortable when the apparent display resolution is around 100 to 110 ppi. People with lower visual acuity tend to prefer a lower resolution around 80-90 ppi.\nYou purchased a display with a native ppi of 164 ppi, which is much too high to be comfortable. The most performant scaling mode is 2:1 which would give you a ppi of 82, which is too small to be comfortable for most people.\nNext time you find yourself purchasing a display, try to find something around 200-220 ppi (looks like 100-110 ppi at 2:1 scaling). Because your laptop has a limit on how many pixels it can push, that means you're looking at a maximum diagonal size of around 29\" (at 5K) to get the picture quality you're looking for.\n", "Q: MS-DOS (FAT32) USB to MS-DOS I am attempting to set up bootcamp for my 2013 MacBook. I have a 16gb USB for the Windows ISO. The USB was formatted in MS-DOS (FAT32). I need just MS-DOS for bootcamp. I attempted to switch it using Disk Utility but when i erase and select MS-DOS it just erases and reverts back to (FAT32)? any way how to fix this?\n\nA: For all practical purposes MS-DOS is MS-DOS (FAT32) nowadays, see https://www.howtogeek.com/235596/whats-the-difference-between-fat32-exfat-and-ntfs/ for instance:\n\nFAT32 is the oldest of the three file systems available to Windows. It was introduced all the way back in Windows 95 to replace the older FAT16 file system used in MS-DOS and Windows 3.\n[...]\nLimitations come with that age, however. Individual files on a FAT32 drive can’t be over 4 GB in size—that’s the maximum. A FAT32 partition must also be less than 8 TB, which admittedly is less of a limitation unless you’re using super-high-capacity drives.\n\n\nA: \nI need just MS-DOS for bootcamp. \n\nNo you don't - you want FAT32 - this is what macOS formats your drive when you pick MS-DOS and what you should use.  According to Wikipedia the original 8-bit FAT doesn't use a partition table, can't deal with directories or files bigger than 8MB, and was for use on 8\" floppy drives. \nApple do say here to use \"A blank 16 GB or larger external USB 2 flash drive, formatted as MS-DOS (FAT)\" but they are either using FAT in the general rather than specific sense (which is confusing) or the document is wrong.\n\nI attempted to switch it using Disk Utility but when i erase and select MS-DOS it just erases and reverts back to (FAT32)? any way how to fix this?\n\nNo there isn't.  As your USB is 16GB it will always format FAT32.  On macOS a volume less than 5MB formats as FAT12, from 5MB-512MB as FAT16 and bigger than that as FAT32.\n\nThese are the (Microsoft) filesystems macOS can identify (from diskutil listFilesystems)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPERSONALITY                     USER VISIBLE NAME\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExFAT                           ExFAT\nFree Space                      Free Space\n  (or) FREE\nMS-DOS                          MS-DOS (FAT)\nMS-DOS FAT12                    MS-DOS (FAT12)\nMS-DOS FAT16                    MS-DOS (FAT16)\nMS-DOS FAT32                    MS-DOS (FAT32)\n  (or) FAT32\n\nFrom Understanding File System (FAT) these are the various size limits:\n\nDifferences between FAT12, FAT16, FAT32\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*a FAT12 file system contains 1.5 bytes per cluster within the file allocation table.\n  \n*a FAT16 file system contains 2 bytes per cluster within the file allocation table.\n  \n*a FAT32 file system includes 4 bytes per cluster within the file allocation table.\n  \n\nSystem  Cluster limit\nFAT12   The amount of data clusters is less than 4087 clusters.\nFAT16   The amount of data clusters is between 4087 and 65526 clusters, inclusive.\nFAT32   The amount of data clusters is between 65526 and 268,435,456 clusters, inclusive. \n\n\nThe macOS commands that create filesystems such as diskutil and hdiutil do not allow you to specify a type of FAT but rather infer it from the size of the volume.\nFor example using .dmg as I don't have such small disks:\n\n\n*\n\n*hdiutil create -size 0.1m -fs MS-DOS -volname 01M /tmp/01m.dmg creates FAT12\n\n*hdiutil create -size 4m -fs MS-DOS -volname 4M /tmp/4m.dmg creates FAT12\n\n*hdiutil create -size 5m -fs MS-DOS -volname 5M /tmp/5m.dmg creates FAT16\n\n*hdiutil create -size 512m -fs MS-DOS -volname 512M /tmp/512m.dmg creates FAT16\n\n*hdiutil create -size 513m -fs MS-DOS -volname 513M /tmp/513m.dmg creates FAT32\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to connect an iMac 21.7 inch 2009 as a monitor to a MacBook Pro late 2013 I’m trying to use my iMac 2009 as a second monitor for my MacBook Pro 2013 but can’t work out how to connect.

Example:\n\n\n*\n\n*To open System Preferences, which I have to do often to manage multiple monitors, I have created the following alias in ~/.bash_profile:\nalias pref='open -a System\\ Preferences'\n\n\n*To put my setup in \"Work From Home\" mode, I have:\nalias wfh='code&rdc&smc&'\n\nwhich opens Visual Studio Code, the Remote Desktop and the Cisco Mobility Client.\n\n*To work with aliases themselves I have:\nalias editbash='nano ~/.bash_profile;source ~/.bash_profile'\n\nwhich opens the ~/.bash_profile in nano editor and then when I'm done, it automatically sources the updated contents of the file for me.\n\nQuestion:\nI have numerous aliases that are all related to git. I often forget the alias for some actions. However, the good news is that all of my git aliases start with gt.\nHow can I list only the aliases that start with a particular string?\n\nA: grep for them\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Far better suggestion from the comments - grep on alias.\nYou can list all your aliases, even the ones not written in ~/.bash_profile, by calling alias.\ngrep the result to find the aliases starting from gt as:\nalias | grep \"^alias gt\"\n\n\n\n\n*Since the aliases are created by writing alias <alias_name>=..., to list the aliases starting with, for example, gt, you can do:\ngrep \"^alias gt\" ~/.bash_profile\n\nThe ^ in the grep argument is an anchor. The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are meta-characters that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.\nIn ^alias gt, it implies that you want only those lines that start with \"alias gt\". On my machine, I get the following result:\nalias gts=\"git status\" \nalias gtd=\"git diff\" \nalias gtpull=\"git pull\"\nalias gtb=\"git branch\"  \nalias gtpush=\"git push\"  \nalias gtpullmk=\"gtpull;./make all\"  \nalias gtst=\"git stash\"  \nalias gtstash=\"gtst save\"  \nalias gtstlist=\"gtst list\"  \nalias gtctall=\"runformatter;git commit -a\"\n\n\n\n\n*Alternatively, you could grep without the anchor as:\ngrep gt ~/.bash_profile\n\nHere, you are simply looking for any line that contains the substring \"gt\", anywhere. As a result, you may get some unnecessary lines, but you will get all aliases that use any of your git aliases.\nOn my machine, I get the following output using this search. Notice the extra line at the top, which was not present in the previous output:\nalias debugmk=\"echows;gtb;${ws}/make ${DEBUG_OPTIONS}\"  \nalias gts=\"git status\"  \nalias gtd=\"git diff\"  \nalias gtpull=\"git pull\"  \nalias gtb=\"git branch\"  \nalias gtpush=\"git push\"  \nalias gtpullmk=\"gtpull;./make all\"  \nalias gtst=\"git stash\"  \nalias gtstash=\"gtst save\"  \nalias gtstlist=\"gtst list\"  \nalias gtctall=\"runformatter;git commit -a\"\n\n\n\n\n*Finally, depending upon which command you find more useful (or even go for both if they both are useful), you can create a new alias to list all git related aliases:\nalias allgit=\"alias | grep gt\"\n\n\nA: You can use the Programmable Completion Builtins compgen command with the a option. The syntax looks like:\ncompgen [option] [word]\n\nThe a option lists all the aliases and word matches all the aliases beginning with those characters.

But it still didn't turn on.\n\nThe amber light simply means it's charging.  Green means that it has detected the \"one wire circuit\" and is passing current to the MacBook.  It doesn't necessarily mean the battery is charged (I have a white 2007 MacBook on my desk with no battery and a green light on the charger)\n\nMacBook Air not starting after SMC reset. Earlier, my Mac was not starting after SMC reset or NVRAM reset.\n\nYou're doing a lot of resets.  Resetting the SMC and NVRAM should be rare:\n\n\n*\n\n*SMC - power, battery and fan issues.  For example, you're having issues charging your Mac or the fans are running at full speed or it doesn't wake from sleep when opening the lid.\n\n*NVRAM - preboot environment variables.

Goal is updating a NVMe SSD firmware on a Mac without optical drive via USB stick that should contain a minimal Linux, flasher and payload.\nThe instructions (PDF) for a firmware update utility say to use Unetbootin on MacOS to write an iso-file to a FAT32 formatted (erased) USB stick.\nThat works. No errors shown.\nWhat then doesn't work is booting a MacBook Pro 2015 from that stick.\nThe external USB-drive never shows up in the boot menu.\n\nWhat I tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*erasing the sticks a few times with DiskUtility \n\n*partitioning the sticks to either MBR or GPT\n\n*3 different sticks \n\n*different laptops (Mac & Windows)\n\n*writing the iso file with dd directly to the stick (and in another round using Balena etcher and universal usb installer)\n\n*different versions of DiskUtility (Sierra and Mojave)\n\n*Windows on-board tools on a PC for re-formatting the sticks\n\n*gparted and fdisk mkfs.vfat  on a Linux machine\n\n*using a different iso (not matching the target device) from the vendor site (works without any issues according to instructions, but can't update my device…)\n\n*writing to customer support (answer: \"iso looks good, should work, please try again\")\n\n*booting a fresh virtual machine on a Mac host with just the needed iso attached. Frustratingly, that indeed boots as intended, but can't update the device either. Neither a Windows PC, nor a Linux laptop can boot the sticks I prepared.\n\n*searching net and especially Ask Different for solutions\n\n\nThe sticks just aren't recognised on any Mac laptop as 'bootable' once the procedure outlined in the manual is finished. All Laptops can boot from external drives (Thunderbolt & USB) and the boot manager updates without interaction once I plug those in.\nPossible reasons : \n- assuming that DiskUtility from 10.12 and 10.14 can't properly format the sticks?\n- is latest version of Unetbootin acting up?\n- is the iso for my device incomplete/damaged?\nThe last item here may be the culprit:\nThe firmware iso for a Samsung 970 EVO is just so much smaller than for a EVOplus:\n\n\n*\n\n*NVMe SSD-970 EVO Plus Firmware ISO 2B2QEXM7 | 28   MB (works, unneeded)\n\n*NVMe SSD-970 EVO      Firmware ISO 2B2QEXE7 | 17.4 MB (doesn't work, needed)\n\n\nThe EVO-iso is mountable directly in macOS and just contains\n bzImage  initrd  isolinux >\n                  boot.cat  isolinux.bin  isolinux.cfg  ldlinux.c32\n\nThe EVO-plus-iso is not mountable but when written to stick with Unetbootin it shows an EFI folder and GRUB files, etc… Since this one does boot and scans the computer for eligible devices, I am a bit stuck here.\n\nNone of these similar questions on AskDifferent offered a working solution:\nCopy Crucial SSD Firmware Update ISO to Bootable USB\nIs it possible to make a bootable USB stick for a Macbook Pro to do firmware update?\nHow to install a bootable ISO onto a single partition of a usb stick?\nHow to create USB Ubuntu boot disk in OS X so that it boots on *non-Apple* computer?\nHow to make and use an USB stick with GParted that will boot on a Mac?\nHow to create a Mac bootable gparted or Parted Magic thumb drive?\n\nSince playing with around with DiskUtilities options it seems to be the case that it is a bit buggy. Switching around between various partitions and filetypes related to FAT/FAT32 results in DiskUtility not recognising its own products, with different options greyed out at different times. Looks to me as if some flag or structural anomaly that DiskUtility introduces keeps this from working, like I might have to really wipe down the stick. Alas, neither wipefs nor gparted did that successfully and I do not know what to look for here. \n\nA: First find USB key disk number from diskutil list.  This method will destroy everything on the disk you copy to so take care. Mine was /dev/disk3 and looked like this:  \n/dev/disk3 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *32.0 GB    disk3\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1\n   2:       Microsoft Basic Data FAT32                   31.8 GB    disk3s2\n\nMake sure no volumes are mounted, then use dd to copy the unmounted ISO file to your device (do not append a partition number, so do not use something like /dev/disk3s2).\nThis worked for me with the NVMe SSD-970 EVO Firmware ISO 2B2QEXE7 from here.\n[hali@macOS] ~ $sudo dd bs=4m if=/Users/hali/Downloads/Samsung_SSD_970_EVO_2B2QEXE7.iso of=/dev/disk3\nPassword:\n4+1 records in\n4+1 records out\n17825792 bytes transferred in 8.546376 secs (2085772 bytes/sec)\n[hali@macOS] ~ $sync\n[hali@macOS] ~ $\n\ndiskutil list now looks like this:\n/dev/disk3 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                            Samsung                *32.0 GB    disk3\n\nand in Disk Utility like this:\n\nReboot holding ⌥ and pick the yellow boot option on USB key called \"Windows\".  It should load the firmware utility fine (it did for me on 2015 MBP).\n\nAfterwards, as mentioned in Arch Wiki the ISO signature needs deleting. \n\nWarning: This will irrevocably destroy all data on /dev/sdx. To restore the USB drive as an empty, usable storage device after using the Arch ISO image, the ISO 9660 filesystem signature needs to be removed by running wipefs --all /dev/sdx as root, before repartitioning and reformatting the USB drive.  \n\nAs wipefs doesn't exist in macOS, this can be achieved by using gdisk to write a new gpt partition table.  Simply reformatting in Disk Utility didn't work to recover use of the USB resulting in lots of \"Operation not permitted\" errors.\n\nA: Disclaimer: There is a risk of losing your SSD and the data stored on it when updating to a new firmware!\nHere are the steps:\n\n*\n\n*Identify your SSD model by running sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvmxxx on your SSD (replace \"xxx\" by your actual device name); here is an example output.\n\n*Prepare a bootable Ubuntu/Kubuntu USB stick, either from Ubuntu or from Windows.\n\n*Start your computer from the said USB stick.\n\n*Open a browser and search \"Samsung SSD firmware\" from any search engine; the first result should be the SSD tools and software download page from Samsung.\n\n*Scroll down until \"Firmware\", expand the section, find the ISO image matching your SSD model and download it.\n\n*Open the ISO image with an archive tool like File Roller or Ark (whatever comes preinstalled with your USB stick) and look for the file name initrd and extract it (drag and drop it outside of the archive and into your file manager window).\n\n*Open again the file initrd with an archive tool (you need to double click twice) and look for the folder root/fumagician; again extract it (drag and drop it outside of the archive).\n\n*Open a console (F4 in some file managers), go inside the folder fumagician you just extracted and run sudo ./fumagician.\n\n*Proceed through the steps of the SSD Magician tool; in my case the reprogrammimg was instant and there was no success or failure confirmation at the end. If the SSD Magician finds no devices then maybe you forgot to use sudo.\n\n*Restart without mounting or otherwise touching the content of the SSD you just updated.\n\n*After restart sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvmxxx should display the updated firmware version. In my case the updated firmware version would not show until the restart.\n\nRemark 1: It seems possible to update from an OS running on the target SSD and I saw YouTube videos showing the SSD Magician tool on Windows doing such hot updates, i.e. on a SSD being used. But I am not entirely sure whether this is safe. The issue is that the OS will write to the SSD after the update procedure but before the restart. There is a risk that the SSD does not handle correctly those writes, hence losing data.\nRemark 2: If UNetbootin is used to create a bootable USB stick from the ISO then the USB stick needs to be formatted with MBR and FAT32; GPT and/or ext4 did not work for me. There is a bug in the ISO image provided by Samsung with AMD based systems. USB and more specifically USB keyboards and mice will not work; since most modern mainboards do not have PS/2 ports anymore navigating through the SSD Magician prompts is virtually impossible on AMD based systems (source).\n", "Q: Does Apple save a (hashed) version of my device passwords? As earlier described in this question, I was asked today by my iPad to enter the user account password of my MacBook, and my MacBook later asked me to provide the passcode of my iPad. I'm specifically not talking about my iCloud password, the actual device passwords were requested and this behaviour is kind of known.\nNow my question is: What happens to these passwords? Are they sent over to Apple? Are they used locally to decrypt something that has been encryted with that passcode?\nSo is Apple in possession of data that can be used to run brute-force attacks agains my device passwords? This would be totally against the idea of the T2-chip limiting brute-force attacks and I never agreed that such information is sent over to Apple and at no point was I informed about that. I'm not sharing my KeyChain with iCloud and do not wish to.\nI couldn't find any exact information on that matter, anybody shedding some light on it is highly welcomed.\n\nA: Apple states they do not have your passwords in their platform security guide. Apple also says they use end to end encryption for keychain.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303\n\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/security/icloud-keychain-security-overview-sec1c89c6f3b/web\nI haven't reverse engineered if it's a hashed / salted version of the password stored locally or if it's just key exchange and entangled secrets that are cryptographically difficult to reverse or bypass. However, my best estimate is no - it's not simply a hashed version of your password.\nApple states that they don't retain the secret or shared key, so I expect if that's the case, it is unintentional or a weakness in their algorithm / implementation and not they are lying to us about their design intent and execution. We would need to have vast access to code review, process review, and personnel interviews to effectively check Apple’s work on their code and process to ensure they didn’t make mistakes in execution and governance.\nThere are very high visibility cases where FBI and U.S. Government frequently complain bitterly, publicly and in the courts arguing that Apple should change their design to make it easier for government to get into people's data and devices, so I tend to think Apple is largely doing precisely what they say to protect the integrity of your data / keys and passwords against surveillance, and unlocking.\nApple clearly designs things to have much data encrypted before your device sends: IP addresses and device identifiers. When they don’t retain that data indefinitely, that limits the potential for lost or stolen data, as well as limits what could even be delivered to the government by legal or procedural discovery. What I can tell is Apple works continually to reduce any non-brute-force access avenues by technical design and by making it easy to choose a complicated passphrase. When we choose secure secrets, that makes bypassing encryption more costly in terms of time and effort.\nWhether you feel Apple can be honest and/or transparent is hard to know ultimately unless you’re there in the room when the government comes knocking for data or concessions.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/government-information.html\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/\n\n*https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/\n", "Q: Is it possible to damage the system (macOS) by installing pirated software?

One is missing the start, the other is missing the end.\nBoth were recorded from the same source, except due to inconsistencies with the recording hardware at the time, one was recorded just slightly faster than the other and so the overlapping parts are at slightly different speeds and pitches - otherwise they are identical.\nI want to merge them together, effectively overlap them, into one complete version of the song, but need to adjust the speed and pitch of one to match the other.  (Then I can simply line up the overlapping parts and fade one in and the other out to get the result - good enough).\nOf course, computers can adjust pitch and speed independently by applying clever algorithms, etc. (although sometimes this results in some quality loss) - unlike say speeding up or slowing down an analog tape or record player where changing the speed changes the pitch as well. This \"non-clever\" analog-type outcome is fine - in fact preferred (to avoid that potential quality loss) - because knowing that the original source for both tracks is the same, getting the speed right this way should get the pitch right anyway, and vice versa.\nWhat app, if any, on Mac can help me achieve this (stretch/shrink an entire track uniformly, both pitch and speed, to sync with another), and what functionality or steps or whatever do I need to understand to do it?  \nI've tried GarageBand, but if that can do it, I can't figure out how.

Sometimes the screen will come back on its own; sometimes I can Command-Tab through programs and quit (I can see that I'm switching via the Touch bar); and sometimes I must restart. Over time, I have discovered that Google Chrome is the culprit, but exactly what is happening remains a mystery.\nMy thought in your case is that perhaps the processes that are causing this issue are resuming through restart.

Make sure it's in the \"up\" position.  If it's write protected on every SD , you may have an issue with the logic board itself.\n\n\n*On USB flash drives, there may be a physical switch or it may be write protected from via a write protect bit, or the chip may be modified from the factory.\n\n\n*Make sure you have the correct privileges.  Sometimes the drive may have had user privileges assigned to them.  Using an Admin account will usually get around this.\nFixing the Device\nThere are a few steps you can take, but all are destructive to the data on the device.\n\n*\n\n*Erase Disk.  As the name implies, this does a simple erase of the disk and marks the free space as \"empty\" with no file system  or partition scheme.\n$ diskutil eraseDisk free Empty /dev/diskX \n\n\n\n*Re-partitition the Disk.  I like to force a rewrite of the partition map to something that macOS is familiar with like a GPT partition and HFS+ file system.  You can use MS-DOS with MBR as well.  Use diskutil listfilesystem to get a full list of supported file systems.\n$ diskutil partitionDisk diskX 1 GPT HFS+ Untitled 100%   ← GPT with HFS Format\n\n$ disktuil partitionDisk diskX 1 MBR FAT32 UNTITLED 100%  ← MBR with MS-DOS\n\n\n\n*Zero out the disk.  Using this command writes zeros to every block of the raw device, meaning you're bypassing everything and accessing the device itself.  This is the nuclear option because it will overwrite every single spot on the device with a zero.  Triple check the device name!\n$ diskutil unmountDisk diskX            ← Only if necessary (you get a \"Resource Busy\")\n\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/diskX bs=1m\n\n\nIf none of the above works, it's likely the device has failed.  On SD cards, this is actually quite common.

And it only booted to Internet Recovery.\nThen, I did something like here (with disk1), but when doing \"gpt  add  -i  2...\" I noticed I forgot to see the output of \"gpt -r show /dev/disk1\". Oh, and I did it anyways without the \"-b  409640  -s  194016208  -t  hfs  /dev/disk0\" I think.\nSo, first I think I would have to repair the partition table, or to add again that partition that I removed back again. Then I would need to fix the original problem of type or corruption, don't I?\nI'm attaching some info of TestDisk analysis and other:\nBackup:\n#1586201402 Disk /dev/sda - 500 GB / 465 GiB - CHS 60821 255 63\n2 : start=       34, size=        6, Id=00, P\n1 : start=       40, size=   409600, Id=00, P\n\nError:\nTestDisk 7.0, Data Recovery Utility, April 2015\nChristophe GRENIER <grenier@cgsecurity.org>\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org\n\nDisk /dev/sda - 500 GB / 465 GiB - CHS 60821 255 63\n\nThe harddisk (500 GB / 465 GiB) seems too small!

I am new to Unity and XCode and had no idea there were a limited number of apps allotted to a personal development profile. Every time I screwed up a project trying to do this tutorial I often struggled to fix it or made it worse (version and platform clash issues) so I started a new project without any idea it would count against some app count on my profile. I had no idea these unfinished doodles were considered apps. As I said, I'm a total newb in this realm! Now I've used all my apps and still don't have anything that works. How do I fix this? Thanks for your help.\nThis is the error I get from Xcode:\nThe maximum number of apps for free development profiles has been reached.\nXcode version 11.4 (11E146)\n\nA: The easiest way to solve this is delete these unfinished apps from your devices. Just delete them like you would any other app - directly on the phone. \nYou can also use the \"Devices & Simulators\" window in Xcode to delete them. If you have a lot, it is perhaps a bit faster.\nIf you have deleted the apps, but still get the error, then you need to remove the profiles themselves also. You can do that from the same \"Devices & Simulators\" window by right-clicking on the name of your iOS device, selecting \"View Provisioning Profiles\" and then removing them.\nYou can also do that on the device in Settings > General > Profile. Choose each no longer used profile and then \"Remove\".\n\nA: In XCode 11.5 not posible to after complete maximum limit.\nI have many try but not find any solution.\nYou add new account in XCode then you can easy to install app.\nAnd you can perchase developer account in Apple.\n", "Q: Copy range of files with same file structure I would like to copy range of jpg files from the multiple folders.\nI have a lot of folders with *.CR2 and *.xmp, in addition, it has a jpg folder with *.jpg files.

How do I move past this point since I cannot get to the verification code?\n\nA: Why not have your mobile company forward that number elsewhere, move the sim or set up a temporary device?\nApple’s FAQ covers what to do for recovering an account if it comes to that. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915\n", "Q: How to disable \"Share Wi-Fi password\" prompt Every few minutes I keep getting the following prompt (on all 3 of my devices - my iMac, Macbook and iPhone):\nMacOS:\n\niOS:\n\nEven if I click \"Decline\" or \"Share\" it still shows up every few minutes on all my devices. How do I stop this from happening?\nI asked the question in Apple Support but no one knows the answer there either: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251248798?\n\nA: This happens in one specific circumstance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Another device is within bluetooth distance of your Mac and both have Bluetooth on. \n\n*The other device is scanning for Wi-Fi\n\n*You and the other person are signed in to iCloud and they are in your contacts. \n\n\nYou can remove their contact, sign out of iCloud, turn off wireless / Bluetooth or share the password. They could sign out of iCloud, turn off Wireless / Bluetooth. \nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/share-a-wi-fi-password-on-mac-mchlp1179/mac\nThe share should send the password, but their device isn’t connecting, so escalate your steps or possibly vacate the area?\nFor iOS removing your contact from their contacts might do the trick as well.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209368\nWorst case, your iCloud are not syncing identity records or her device needs other fixes.

(2018 11 inch model) Apparently the selfie camera (FaceTime HD) can operate in both 30 FPS and 60 FPS modes. I haven’t found a way to change it. Is there one?\n\nA: To adjust the refresh rate and resolution of the selfie camera, you also have to adjust the video recording options of the main shooter too. Apple does not let you change the settings independently of one another. \nGo to: Settings>Camera>Record Video> “1080p at 60FPS” or “1080p at 30FPS”.\nYou should see the results immediately in the viewfinder. \n", "Q: My search engine is Yahoo, how can I change it to Google?

This is the software that first executes when a Mac starts up. The firmware is capable of reading partitions using various formats such as JHFS+. When Apple introduced the APFS format, Apple only provided firmware updates for certain Mac models. Older Macs can not boot from APFS formatted partitions, because the firmware does not recognize the APFS format. Your Mac is one such model. There is no way to fix this. The macOS 10.15 operating system can only boot from APFS formatted partitions.\n\nA: There are reverse-engineered EFI APFS drivers you could use such as this - you could look at these Macrumors threads OpenCore on the Mac Pro and macOS 10.15 Catalina on Unsupported Macs\nAlternatively a simpler solution is macOS Catalina Patcher which is compatible with \"Early-2008 or newer Mac Pro, iMac, or MacBook Pro\"\nIf it works it will run (possibly unusably) slow - I have a 2006 MBP which is supported up to Lion.

After doing initial setup and whatnot, will the phone and all preinstalled apps work properly without ever connecting to the internet again? (Assuming basic cellular is active, or not if that makes a difference) \nSpecifically, is there any “phone home“ requirement in the default software? \n\nA: Yes.\nYou can keep an iPhone permanently offline after doing the initial setup and still use it. You can continue to use the basic telephonic feature, and the stock apps such as Calculator, Camera, Photos etc. which doesn't require an active Internet connection to function.\nThere's no requirement in iOS, the operating system running on iPhones to phone home, that would hinder its normal operation, in total absence of an Internet connection.\nHowever, any feature, even within the built-in apps, dependant on Internet connectivity would remain unavailable, such as the ability to send and receive iMessages, accessing the App Store to install new apps, syncing contacts, email, calendar etc. to iCloud, using Siri, Apple virtual assistant and even updating the iOS software (in untethered mode).\n", "Q: How to use Launchctl for schedule application I try to work with Launchctl and have a question:\nHow can I set up an application to run in a few minutes using Launchctl?

I had to basically wipe my Mac and reinstall Catalina[1] because I messed up some python package installations very badly, and I was able to erase it seemingly successfully.

(There are some other odd changes as well, like Google seems to take longer to respond, but that may be because of higher internet traffic.) After searching, I haven't found anyone with a similar issue. \nIs this a signal that I messed something up while erasing my old system, or is this normal variance across machines? If it is an issue, what might it be, and how might I fix it?\nThank you!\n[1] Following the instructions at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065\n[2] It used to be something more conventional, ending with $.\n\nA: With MacOS Catalina, the default terminal shell switched from bash to zsh. It didn't migrate existing users, but when you reinstalled Catalina it took the opportunity to update your default. The default prompt for bash is '$', for zsh '%'. Use chsh -s /bin/bash to switch back to your old shell as default. Alternatively, change your prompt by setting the variable PS1.

I'd just plug in an external HD and use either Time Machine (on Mac) or an encrypted VeraCrypt container (on Windows) to backup my files.\nWhat can I do to backup the files on my iPhone, without a computer or a cloud service?\nWhile, as of recently, iOS can mount an external flash drive, it makes no sense tranferring my files to an unencrypted drive just for the sake of backup. (Correct me if I'm wrong, but it can't mount an encrypted HD, does it?)\nCan you think of any solutions to this problem?\n\nA: iOS only supports backup to a computer running iTunes or to iCloud.\nIf your aim is to keep everything on servers you control yourself you might use an NextCloud installation (with disk encryption) and use the Files app (or native NextCloud apps) to manage your data. That way you at least won't use your data in case your phone gets lost or stolen.\n\nA: If you would never use a \"foreign\" cloud server, then try a Synology NAS Disk Station. There are many ways to backup data (photos, files, videos ...).\nThere are even Synology apps from the app store for iPhone and iPad (DS video, DS photo, DS audio, DS file...). A look at the Synology app would certainly be worthwhile.\nSo you have the backup (photos, files, music...) on your own hard disk and a redundant protection (raid systems possible) with you.\nFor more information, visit the synology website https://www.synology.com/en-global\n", "Q: firefox mac os: how to remap cmd+r to f5?

What can I do to work around it? The Problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*A couple of weeks ago, the iMac started \"beachballing\" regularly in normal use\n\n*There is no discernible pattern to what triggered a beachball. It could be switching between windows, trying to type, using Spotlight, opening or closing an application, or even just whilst idle.\n\n*Over the next few days, the hangs became so frequent it rendered the iMac effectively unusable\n\n*I tried literally everything I could think of to fix it (detailed below), but to no avail\n\n*The only thing that finally solved it was wiping the disk and reinstalling everything from a Time Machine backup\n\n*But about a week later, the same thing began happening again. I still couldn't figure it out, so was forced to reinstall (again!)\n\n*And now, yesterday, it's come back once more\n\n\nI am at my wit's end. I work in IT, and rely on the iMac to be able to work from home whilst my country is in lockdown. My local Apple Store is obviously closed. Each Time Machine restoration takes almost 18 hours to complete, meaning I'm unable to work during that time (never mind the time waiting on the SBBOD to disappear).\nThe iMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*2017 27-inch Retina 5K iMac\n\n*macOS Catalina 10.15.4\n\n*32GB RAM\n\n*4.2GHz i7 processor\n\n*Fusion Drive (APFS, comprised of a 128GB SSD + 2TB HDD)\n\n*T2 security chip\n\n\nWhat I've Already Tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checking Activity Monitor during beachballing\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: load is usually ~20%\n\n*Memory: 0 swap used, ~16GB free memory remaining\n\n\n*Signing out of iCloud\n\n*Disabling Spotlight indexing\n\n*Creating a new user account\n\n*SMC reset\n\n*NVRAM/PRAM reset\n\n*Disk Utility First Aid\n\n*Boot into Safe Mode\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode, and use diskutil verifyVolume and repairVolume\n\n*Repairing Home Folder permissions\n\n*Checking Console and reviewing system.log and other files\n\n\n*\n\n*No correlation between beachballing and log entries\n\n\n*Running a spindump via Activity Monitor\n\n\n*\n\n*Worryingly, spindumps don't show up — they just result in a Crash Report appearing in Console (see here)\n\n\n*Running EtreCheck\n\n\n*\n\n*No major issues found\n\n*No noteworthy minor issues found\n\n\n*Running DriveDx\n\n\n*\n\n*The results for the SSD were fine\n\n*The results for the HDD do look a bit concerning — see here.\n\n\n*Running Apple's hardware diagnostic test at startup\n\n\n*\n\n*No faults found\n\n\n*Reinstalling macOS\n\n\nMy Suspicions:\nI found it interesting that reinstalling macOS does NOT fix the problem, but wiping the Fusion drive, reinstalling macOS, AND restoring from a Time Machine backup in one go DOES fix it (at least temporarily).\nMy DriveDx results seem to indicate the HDD is in a \"failing\" state. I don't know if this is just precautionary or if this could actually be causing it. It's hard to pin the blame on this directly, as the beachballs do not seem to correlate with disk I/O, but I can't say that for certain as I don't know enough about this area. I also would've assumed that the Apple hardware diagnostic test you can run at startup might have identified this if it really was a problem...?\nSo my hunch right now, in the absence of any more obvious clues, is that maybe this problem is caused by a failing HDD in the Fusion drive...? That might explain how wiping and reformatting the drive lets things work smoothly for a week or so, but after enough new sectors have been written to and data shuffled around on the disk, it starts to slow down after time. That's just a hunch!\nWhat Next?\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you have any other suggestions of things to check or try?\n\n*Are there any other clues I might have missed?\n\n*Do you think my hypothesis about the failing HDD is right?\n\n\n*\n\n*If so, I understand the HDD in a Fusion drive is not user-serviceable...\n\n*So I would assume the next best alternative would be to buy e.g. 2TB Thunderbolt drive and use that as the startup disk, instead of the Fusion drive?\n\n*Is this possible? Are there any drawbacks? Any brands you'd recommend?\n\n\n\nThanks for reading this lengthy post. Any advice or guidance is really appreciated!\nJack\n\nA: I'm just going to echo Allan's comment: if DriveDx says your drive is \"failing\" then it needs to be replaced. The only workaround is to remove the drive and stop using it.\nDisk health checks have a low sensitivity but high specificity. In other words, it might report that a failing drive still looks healthy, but it will never report a healthy drive as failing. If it reports failing, we must trust that result.\nThe reason that wiping the drive helps, at least for a little while, is that it does more work to avoid using the parts of the drive that are already known to be bad. But the drive is like a rotting fruit \n -- even the good parts are going bad, so eating around the bad part doesn't help for long. \n", "Q: Find out if account is locked using terminal I need to detect if a user has locked their account on Catalina ( for example by typing an incorrect password x times).

My external monitor doesn't support HDR, so PaulVO's method didn't work for me.\nAs Nimesh suggested, I unchecked the \"True Tone\" for my Mac retina display. I immediately saw my Mac display had the same blue tint. Then I was able to calibrate both the color of my Retina display and external monitor. Somewhere between D50 and D65 works best as qrius suggested.\nThank you all for the inputs!\n\nA: In my case, an options called \"True Tone\" was enabled. I have unchecked it and the monitor acted normally after then. I found the option in the Macbook's display settings not the external one, meaning it actually apply the same effect to the external monitor.\n\n\nA: If you update to macOS 10.15.4 it may now detect that you have a HDR screen, and makes your external screen colors look weird. \nTo fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Display settings \n\n*Uncheck \"High Dynamic Range\" for your external display \n\n*Everything should be back to normal.\n\n\nA: As far as I have researched, there is no one button click way to fix it but you can do it through Calibration Assistant.\n\n*\n\n*Go to Display Settings\n\n*If your monitor supports HDR, make sure it is unchecked.\n\n*Click on Color tab.\n\n*Click Calibrate and keep clicking continue until whitepoint setting screen, and then move the slider until you get your preferred tint level.\n\nI kept it somewhere between D50 and D65 to give me the tint similar to when MacBook Lid was kept open.\n\nA: I love the True Tone features, so I choose to increase my LG monitor color temperature instead, that's inconvenient because each time I close the lid, I have to switch the color temp setting between 2 presets: 1 for lid open, 1 for lid close :((\nIt's too inconvenient, so finally I disabled the True Tone, and turn on Night Shift all day with a slightly warm setting :)) The downside is the color is not correct if Night Shift is turned on\nThere was a discussion here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254683389\n", "Q: Is there such a thing as unsafe cpu levels on mac?

As a teacher, I want to be able to scan a stack of tests into one big PDF file, split that into single pages (I already have the Automator service for that), and then combine the results into a separate file for each student. So if I had 10 students and a 4 page test, I'd want to be able to combine those 40 files into 10 separate PDFs, ideally labeled by student name (if there was a way for me to input that list of names into Automator). Worst case scenario, I just run a combinePDF service for each individual student, but I didn't know if there was a way I could do that all in one fell swoop?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I'd use the third-party command line tool, cpdf, and script the process of creating the separate PDF documents for each student.\nHave a look at: Coherent PDF Command Line Tools Community Release\n\n\n*\n\n*Download pre-built cpdf tool (This is a direct download link. Building from source is available from link on main page linked above.) \n\n*A comprehensive user manual for the PDF tools can be found as a PDF document, or browsable online. \n\n*Note: the Community Release version of Coherent PDF Command Line Tools is free.\n\n\nThere is no need to first extract the the scanned PDF document into individual files to then combine them as the following example shell script code extracts the pages from the scanned PDF document four pages at a time while naming each new PDF document for each student:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n    # Replace e.g. \"Student 01\", etc. with the students name\n    # in the order required as scanned in the PDF document.\n\nmy_students=(\"Student 01\" \"Student 02\" \"Student 03\" \"Student 04\" \"Student 05\" \"Student 06\" \"Student 07\" \"Student 08\" \"Student 09\" \"Student 10\")\n\n    # Replace \"/path/to/scanned.pdf\" with the \n    # actual pathname of the scanned document.\n\nscanned_document=\"/path/to/scanned.pdf\"\n\n    # NOTE: If cpdf is not in your PATH, then use its fully\n    #       qualified pathname, e.g: /use/local/bin/cpdf\n\nx=1\ny=4\nfor this_student in \"${my_students[@]}\"; do\n    cpdf \"${scanned_document}\" $x-$y -o \"${this_student}.pdf\"\n    x=$(( x + 4 ))\n    y=$(( y + 4 ))\ndone\n\n\nTo use this shell script in Terminal, first run the following compound command:\nf=\"processpdf\"; touch \"$f\"; open -e \"$f\"; chmod u+x \"$f\"\n\nThen in the document that opens, TextEdit by default, copy and paste the example shell script code into it, make the appropriate edits, and then save it.\nIt can now be used in Terminal using e.g. ./processpdf or /path/to/processpdf or if placed in a location that's within the PATH, then simply, e.g.: processpdf\nNote: As coded the new  PDF documents are created in the PWD in Terminal. You can add e.g. /path/to/ to \"${this_student}.pdf\", e.g., \"/path/to/${this_student}.pdf\" if you want.\nIf you need/want to apply this to a Run Shell Script action in Automator, instead of regular shell script usage, let me know an I can update the answer.\nIn either case, if you want to pass the script a file with the names of the students, instead of using an array, as presently coded, that is doable too.\n\nNote: The example shell script code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. As an example, as presently coded, the  new PDF documents will overwrite existing documents of the same name  without warning.\n\nA: You could skip that first step where you split the large PDF into one page to one file. Then take your large PDF and split it after every four pages into 10 different files. This basically undoes what you did first. The app PDFsam will split a PDF into files after every x pages.

You’d need to see how the chips were laid out and what the addressing scheme was.  Since Apple doesn’t provide this, you’d be guessing.\nSince these chips are soldered, they can’t be (user) replaced unless you take it to a shop that does SMT rework.  \nKeep in mind it could also be the memory “controller” that handles the addressing of the memory that’s has also failed.

The standard way is to leave some blanks for the formula among the text, and cover the blanks with the LatexIT formulas.

So I decided to install gdisk. In the process, I specified h for hybrid recovery command and used 2, 3, 4 for GPT partition numbers. When it asked to specify a hex code, I used ac for partition 2, 07 for partition 3, and 07 for partition 4. I then told it to set the bootable flag for partition 3. It then asked me if I wanted to change partition 4 to EE so I said yes. I have data on partition 2 I would like to recover, if that is still possible.\nNow, I cannot boot into either Mac or Windows. And the ability to use gdisk has disappeared. Thanks for your help.\n\nA: First off, having Mojave and a BIOS booting Windows is an uncommon, but possible combination. So I have to ask: Are you sure your Mac is setup this way?\nThe first partition should be type EE. When the gdisk command asks something like \"good for grub?\" The answer should be Yes. This will set the first partition to type EE. The second partition usually is where macOS resides. If you have Mojave installed, then this will be an APFS container. There is no hex code for a APFS type of partition. Feel free to make one up. How about FF? If the Mac is using a APFS container, then the third partition will be for Windows. This should be type 07 and should be marked as bootable. You can use the P command in gdisk to see what is in the GPT. This should confirm what I have posted so far. The 4th partition can be left empty. \n\nOf course, if Windows is UEFI booting, then all of the above can be ignored. In this case, you want a fully protected MBR table.\n\nYou do not include much information on how exactly you managed to repartition a larger space for Boot Camp. I doubt this can be accomplished by using gdisk alone.\nI see from your post, that you can boot to macOS Recovery. Try to capture the output from the following commands and post to your question. Note: With the current state of the partition tables, the gpt command may produce an error message..\nfdisk /dev/disk0\ngpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nNext, type typing the following commands. \nfdisk -e /dev/disk0\nset 4\n07\nquit\n\nIf asked about writing out, confirm you want to.\nHopefully, you will be able to boot macOS.\n", "Q: Camera not listed under Privacy settings since upgrade to macOS Sierra I recently started working from home on my Mac by connecting to Microsoft Remote Desktop from my PC at this office. My problem is when using Skype or Microsoft Teams in the remote session, no camera is found.\nMy Mac built-in camera works well - I tried Facetime, messenger and photo booth.\nI have checked the remote desktop settings: the camera device box is ticked to be used in the remote sessions.\nHowever I have checked my Mac Privacy settings, and Camera is not listed in the options, which means I can't control which app or website can use it.\nNote: I tried adding apps that use camera in Accessibility but that was useless.\nNote 2: I recently upgraded to macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and might have \"lost\" it at that time.\nSo my question is: how can I add Camera under Privacy?\nUnless there is another way to allow my Mac built-in camera to be use in my Microsoft remote session?\n\n\nA: Do you have already tried a restart?\nVery special.

I turned off the machine and when I turned it back on, there was iTunes and the stubborn pop-up.  I'm using MacBookAir, bought in December 2019.\n\nA: There can be multiple things happening here. If you have the spinny wheel, iTunes is obviously hanging/not responding. You can fully quit it by using Option + Command + Escape, selecting iTunes, and pressing Force Quit. If that doesn't work, you can open Activity Monitor (You can press Command + Space and then type Activity Monitor), find and select iTunes, and press the Stop symbol with an X in the center, and that should be the end of that. If none of this works, you can restart.\n", "Q: Is BootCampDrivers.com safe? I've had tons of scaling and performance issues in scaling of 3D applications and games under Windows on my MacBook Pro 16\" 2019 (MBP 16,1) due to the extremely outdated AMD drivers Apple ships with BootCamp. Searching online, the solution appears to be installing a customized version of more modern drivers from BootCampDrivers.com, a website providing improved 3D drivers for Macs running Windows. Before putting anything valuable on my Mac, I decided to give them a try and - as expected - everything was smooth and scaling issues (making any fullscreen game unplayable) were fixed. I have since wiped Windows and was planning to reinstall it fresh now.\nWhile the drivers work amazing, I cannot find much info on the Internet about how they are getting made. How can I ensure that they do not contain malware of some sort? I doubt someone is deploying a trojan specifically made for users of high-end MacBooks running Windows who are looking for drivers that aren't several years old, but is there a way to be a bit more sure, perhaps by actually comparing the drivers with the original ones?\nIt appears that the custom installer of AMD graphics drivers also installs a certificate root to enable signed BootCampDrivers.com code. Does this provide any sort of security or can anyone create such a certificate to be approved by Windows?\n\nA: Apple does recommend visiting AMD's website for updated Windows graphics drivers. See Boot Camp Support or more specifically Update AMD graphics drivers for Windows in Boot Camp. I would assume AMD would provide the most up-to-date drivers for their products. Also, often Apple Software Update and as well as Microsoft Update will provide updated drivers for Windows hardware.\n", "Q: How to use Launchd? (sorry if this is a bad question. I am new to apple coding)\nI want to run a .scpt file at a specific time, once a day, every day using launchd (if there is a better way please tell me) I am running macOS Catalina, and can make it a .app \nHow would I use launchd to run this? Please give me the complete code/steps to run this as I have no experience with Html/Css/Plist files.\nCan somebody post a code template? I have never used PLIST files\n\nA: launchd manages the daemon(s) that ultimately run your job (in your case an scpt). But in a setup similar to the \"man behind the curtain\" in The Wizard of Oz you don't talk directly to launchd. Instead, you will prepare a .plist (property list) file that will be parsed by launchctl, and only then presented to launchd for action. \nI did this (manually created a .plist file) a while ago, and wrote up a brief \"how-to\" that you can find on this GitHub page. My experience was that writing an error-free .plist file from scratch is arcane and error-prone, but I'm sure one gets better with practice! \nNote that this example was done on Mojave - not on Catalina. And as with various other things, Apple has made access to launchd (the man behind the curtain) more difficult in the name of security. In other words, the sample from my GitHub page runs successfully on Mojave, but it will not run on Catalina without hacking around Apple's more restrictive security measures. \nWhich brings me to the point of this: Instead of manually creating a .plist file, you may wish to consider using a third-party tool called LaunchControl. For Catalina, 'LaunchControl' now includes a \"helper tool\" called fdautil that simplifies cooperation with Apple's security mechanisms. I've used it successfully for two UserAgent jobs that run under launchd on Catalina.  \n", "Q: Is it ok to delete iOS Files from my macbook pro? I have in my MacBook pro a folder called MyName iPhone. Which is taking up about 21gb of space. \nIt seems like a backup of the phone. It says last accessed: 2 years ago which happens to be when I go my MacBook pro. \nWhat happens if I delete this folder? Is it recommended? What will I lose? Will my phone's data be lost or unrecoverable?\n\nA: Yes. You may safely delete these files listed in iOS Installers as they are the last version of iOS you installed on your iDevice(s). They're used to restore your iDevice without needing a download if there has been no new update to iOS. If you delete these files and you later need to restore your iPhone, iTunes will update to the newest iOS version by uploading the appropriate installer file.\nI manage my iPhone 8 & an iPad 6th Gen through iTunes and this is what I see.

If you are comparing it with other commands available in system or any 3rd party commands, such as git, running Homebrew commands may appear slow, even when the command in question is not accessing the network/Internet.\nIf it helps, Homebrew commands (verbs) aren't build as native executables, but are Ruby scripts which are interpreted (unlike a native executable for any other command such as git, which is pre-compiled and is executed when run).

In 2017, the RAM was upgraded. Also the internal HD was replaced with an SSD.\nRecently, the MacBook's OS was updated to Catalina because some other software required the upgrade. The update essentially worked just fine and I could work with the laptop. However, a few days ago the system slowed down significantly up to a point where it's not usable anymore. Right now, directly after rebooting, I can hardly open any apps. The colored spinning wheel appears immediately and the machine more or less freezes. Also I cannot properly open Finder, etc.\nI tried to connect the SSD externally via USB to another Mac. The behavior is the same.\nI did some checks on the SSD:\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility says: https://imgur.com/a/ljvuHHt\n\n\n*The log when trying to do \"first aid\" on the disk says the\nfollowing: https://imgur.com/a/FgXVoDu\nAs you can see, there are some errors. Could they be related to the\nOS update?\n\n\n*I also installed DriveDx: https://imgur.com/a/BhBA6aa Looks good,\nif you ask me.\n\nCan you help me identifying the issue here?\n\nA: I've also struggled with the same Macbook type and encountered a similar problem. Replaced the HDD with a SSD and it worked for almost two years, until the Mac became really slow.\nLooks like the SATA cable is broken and needs replacement. See these ifixit instructions for the replacement.\nThe SSD I've used was a SanDisk SDSSDA-480G which is really slow now, even when I put it in an USB enclosure on another Mac. Writing is now limited to 2MB/s, while reading is still faster (around 250MB/s). I've verified with a different SSD and HDD that the enclosure isn't the problem for those low speeds. Looks like the disk is also damaged as side effect from the SATA cable.\nI've replaced cable and SSD with new components and the same machine is now fast again.\n", "Q: exe file not found with which after setting the Path I need to have an exe file found in the terminal with \"which FILE\" command.

When it gets to the locked state, it allows me to log into my account, by typing password, but it won't let me switch user or get to the screen, where I can restart it.\nKeyboard is even more weird. It react to all feature buttons (brightness, sound, keyboard brightness), except power button and \"app buttons\" (f3-f4). It doesn't react to holding power button for 10+ seconds, nor cmd+option+power button shortcut.\nI'm able to call \"force quit apps\" menu via cmd+alt+esc and close all apps and restart finder, but it doesn't help.\nAny ideas what should I do? \nI can't detach battery, since it 2015 retina model and I don't have correct screwdriver on me.\nUPDATE: External mouse and keyboard react the same way\n\nA: After a while, I've noticed that all shortcuts work in Finder. Here are my steps, how I fixed the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to launch finder, by killing rest of the apps via  \"force quit apps\" menu (Command+Alt+Esc)\n\n*Go to utilities folder (Shift+Command+U)\n\n*Use arrows to select Terminal\n\n*Open terminal (Command+Down Arrow)\n\n*Issue command sudo shutdhown -r now. I decided to use -r flag to reboot my mac, in case power button is dead and I won't be able to load it.\n\n\nNow everything works fine. It was just a software bug.\n\nA: Some processes may be active behind the typical \"force quit apps\" menu.  \nOpen the activity monitor, click on \"Memory\" and see what's commanding most of the resources. For most macs, anything over 1GB of memory will result in too much memory pressure and slow performance.  A short term solution is to \"quit\" or \"force quit\" using the X button in the upper left hand corner.\n\nA: Try to reboot your computer.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the power button for at least 5 seconds (in your case, hold it down for about 30 seconds) if that doesn't work, try the other options below\n\n*Open Terminal and issue the following command to restart your computer\n$ sudo shutdown -r now\n\n\n*Also try shutting it down completely, then powering back up with the power button:\n$ sudo shutdown -h now\n\nIf you can get things back up and running, I highly suggest resetting the SMC as it appears to be a power issue.  There are different methods depending on your Mac model so be sure to read the steps carefully.\n", "Q: Enable trackpad via keyboard I prefer to disable the trackpad on my macbook when an external mouse is attached via bluetooth, so that I don't accidentally hit it and to discourage me from using it, which I find un-ergonomic.\nHowever, sometimes I'll move the macbook to the sofa or another room and forget the bluetooth mouse. In those cases I'm stuck with no mouse controller at all. So I would like to be able to re-enable the trackpad. However, I find that hard to do, using just the keyboard.\nThis is how far I've gotten:\n\nIt's that second checkbox I need to toggle, but I can't find a way to manipulate it without a mouse. Can it be done?\nI actually did manage it using \"Mouse Keys\", but... mouse keys are quite annoying, since they disable the regular action of nine buttons on the keyboard. I also tried \"Head Pointer\", which is even more annoying in my opinion.\nSo I'm hoping there is some way to use the keyboard to do it, I might have overlooked.\n\nA: You can enable full keyboard access to easily navigate the on-screen controls using the Tab and arrow key.\nGo to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts and check the checkbox shown towards the bottom that reads, Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls.\n\nNow with the above set up, you can simply open System Preferences using Spotlight (which itself can be launched using the keyboard shortcut Command + Space), then use the keyboard shortcut Command + F to move focus to the System Preferences search field. Now type Mouse and trackpad and select the result that reads Mouse and trackpad easier to use.\n\nThis would take you to the desired preference pane. Now you can easily use the Tab key to navigate to the required checkbox and toggle the setting.\n\nP.S.: With full keyboard access, on-screen controls can be navigated using the Tab and/or arrow keys. A control can be activated or toggled using the Space or the Enter key, and dialogue boxes dismissed using the the Esc key.\n\nA: If you want to disconnect your Bluetooth Mouse, just turn off Bluetooth.\nYou will need a (free) utility called blueutil to turn it off.  See this answer for full details on where to obtain and how to use.  \nYou can use AppleScript to disable Bluetooth as well.\nOnce disconnected, your track pad will begin working again. \n", "Q: Can't view contents of a certain existing folder I have a flash drive formatted to ExFat with multiple folders, one of which contains various mp4 files. Likely because of some stupid decisions which include \"Forcing the computer to shut down in the middle of a process because it appeared to be at a standstill,\" the folder with the mp4 files no longer display its contents when I click on it. Instead it shows me an empty folder for a few seconds before shutting finder down on its own.\nAll of the other folders are fine, and spotlight searching the flash drive shows the files, so they're still there somewhere. I can play them as normal through spotlight search, but attempting to click \"Get info\" results in Finder shutting down again. I can't move the files out of the folder through spotlight search either.\nI've tried copying the folder from the flash drive to the desktop, and it gives that window that says \"Copying x amount of files,\" but after ejecting the flashdrive, the files no longer show up in the spotlight search, as if none of the files actually transferred. Opening the desktop folder also results in Finder quitting.\nJust before all this occurred, I had a problem with the Spotlight Comments section where none of the words would display, but they still popped up in Spotlight searches. Likely due to similar stupid decisions. (I don't learn, apparently)\nI've considered plugging the flash drive into another computer to see what it does, but I'm afraid it might somehow make things worse, and the folder on the flash drive may be the only copy of it left, depending on if the one I copied to the desktop actually contains the files or not.\nI've tried moving the folder from the desktop onto another flash drive just for the hell of it, but that appears empty too, and also quits Finder when opened. I tried re-indexing the desktop folder, though its reason for not working may be because the files aren't there. I tried running mkdir ${TMPDIR}/com.apple.IconServices in Terminal too, from another suggestion, but the flash drive wasn't plugged in when I did. I'm just afraid to do anything to the folder on the flash drive itself because it may be the only copy I have left, and I don't want to make things worse.\nI don't know if any of this is important, but the computer I'm using is a Mac OS X Lion, made in early 2008 with a Windows 7 partition (I've been using the Mac side though.) It's pretty ancient, and I'm pretty stupid, so I'm not surprised I'm having problems.\n\nA: If you still can access the content of the drive via Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use rsync, ditto, or cp to copy the content of the whole flash drive onto another drive\n\n*Reformat the flash drive \n\n*Copy your data back\n\n\nI'm not sure whether it's wise to trust a drive which doesn't seem to fully work anymore. Maybe replacing it with a new one is the safer approach.\n", "Q: Touch Bar stopped working after water damage I have a MacBook Pro (13\", 2018) with a touch bar. I accidentally dropped a bit of water on my touch bar and it stopped working. It's been that way for a while now.\nI tried opening the activity monitor to see if it pops up like how it does for the others, but nothing related to the touch bar is appearing to me. However, the fingerprint sensor still works.\nHow can I make the rest of the touch bar function again?\n\nA: This sounds like you'll need an SMC/NVRAM reset. \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut Down your Mac and unplug everything.\n\n*On your built-in keyboard, press and hold all of the following keys. Your Mac might turn on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Control  on the left side of your keyboard\n\n*Option (Alt)  on the left side of your keyboard\n\n*Shift  on the right side of your keyboard\n\n\n*Keep holding all three keys for 7 seconds, then press and hold the power button as well. If your Mac is on, it will turn off as you hold the keys.\n\n*Keep holding all four keys for another 7 seconds, then release them.\n\n*Wait a few seconds, then press the power button to turn on your Mac.\n\n\nIf this still doesn't work, shut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R. \nYou can release the keys after the Apple logo appears and disappears for the second time. \nIf ALL of that doesn't work, probably go to an Apple store (assuming they're still open where you live).\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the NVRAM or PRAM of your Mac - Apple Support\n\n*How to reset the SMC of your Mac - Apple Support\n", "Q: Song artwork does not appear on album? Ever since upgrading to the new Music app on Catalina (or maybe was it when I copied my music in from a backup?) all of my album artwork is not visible on the album views:\n\nThe art is still attached to the individual songs, as evidenced by viewing the song information:\n\nHow do I get this song art (which clearly exists and is available) to show up on the album view?\n\nA: I'm still not sure exactly why this happened, but I was able to find a solution in via one of Doug's AppleScripts.

When I kill this process, everything works fine. While the process is running, I cannot work with the MacBook. I cannot startup Finder, I cannot typ anything, etc. I can barely manage to open the Activity Manager and kill siad pkd process.\nHere is a picture of which files this process is using:\n\nDoes anyone know where this is coming from? Why does it block the laptop entirely? How can I solve this issue?\nThe laptop is a MacBook Pro Mid-2012 (serial number is C1MK9X6ZDTY3; it is a MacBook Pro 13-Inch \"Core i5\" 2.5 Mid-2012). The operating system was recently updated to Catalina 10.15.4. Thanks for your help.\n\nA: One or more of the plugins you have installed is misbehaving. The pkd pluginkit daemon can be queried with the following command to list all the plugins.\nOpen Terminal and run this command:\npluginkit -mAvvv > ~/Desktop/PluginKitReport.txt\n\nLook on your Desktop for \"PluginKitReport.txt\" open the file in a text editor of your choice. The output listing will be extensive. Look for anything weird that isn't obviously a part of macOS provided by Apple. You can also run EtreCheck which will query your system and build a report detailing what system / kernel extensions you have installed as well as non-Apple background launchd daemons running.  It does not detail personal info. Update your question with the output from EtreCheck.\nSuspect a rogue adware browser extension or other adware / malware or perhaps some 3rd party software misbehaving.\n\nA: According to the man page, pkd is a:\n\nmanagement and supervision daemon for plug-in services\n\nYou can stop it with:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.pluginkit.pkd\n\nIt will restart automatically when needed.\n", "Q: How do I use the Highlight Selection tool after taking a screenshot? After taking a screenshot in macOS, I bring up the markup dialog (introduced in macOS Mojave) and try to use the highlighter tool, but it seems to do nothing. Am I just using it wrong? I'd like to add yellow highlighter to some text in my screenshot.\nSteps to reproduce\n\n\n*\n\n*Initiate a screenshot with ⌘ Cmd - ⇧ Shift - 5\n\n*Ensure that Options -> Show Floating Thumbnail is enabled\n\n*Capture a still image\n\n*Double-click the thumbnail that appears in the bottom right corner. This reveals the markup dialog.\n\n*Press the Highlight Selection pen tool\n\n\n\nExpected Result\nDragging my cursor across the image should highlight white areas in yellow\nActual Result\nDragging my cursor across the image moves the entire window without changing the image content\n\nA: I found a workaround (needless to say, there shouldn't need to be a workaround).\nIf you have a device running iOS (or iPadOS) you can hand-off the screenshot to that device.\n\nOnce it's been handed off, there you can highlight with a marker. After you are finished editing there, you can tap 'done' and it will bring the edited image back to your computer.\n\n", "Q: Force-disconnect all remote users from Applescript or shell? I have a mac that I want to automatically restart every night, but it is regularly accessed remotely from other machines in the house, and if anyone is still connected when it needs to restart it displays a prompt that it will disconnect remote users if the restart is allowed, and then just sits there waiting for a response.\nIs there any way, possibly using Applescript or shell, to force a restart and automatically disconnect any remote users?\n\nA: The following example AppleScript code works for me in macOS Catalina to restart the system and click the Restart button on the \"There is a user sharing this computer. If you restart they will be disconnected\" dialog that shows if Users accessing File Sharing on the machine are connected.\ntell application \"Finder\" to restart\nrepeat 5 times\n    try\n        tell application \"System Events\" to click UI element \"Restart\" of window 1 of application process \"loginwindow\"\n    end try\n    delay 1\nend repeat\n\nObviously the number of loops is arbitrary as is the value of the delay command.

Next, under System Prefs > Users & Groups, I right clicked on my original account and clicked advanced options. I changed the account name field to match what I had just renamed the user folder. The “Full name” field was my full name. Notably, I did not edit the “Home directory” field (I believe this is what caused my problem). I hit OK and restarted, and when I logged in as the original user, whose name I had just tried to change, my data was gone, I got all the prompts to set up my Mac, etc. Under System Prefs > Users & Groups, I noticed that both the account I was logged into and the admin account I’d just created to do the name change had lost admin privileges (both were “Standard”). When I tried to unlock and access advanced settings, none of my previous admin username/password combos worked. \nI read this thread: < Renaming user failed, lost admin rights> and ended up booting up in single user mode to create a new user with admin privileges. I was able to grant admin rights back to my original user account. However, this account still had none of my data. Under Advanced Options in System Pref, the \"Account Name\" field for the original user had not changed -- it was still the original account name which I had tried to get rid of. \nUnder /Users/ I can see that my data is still there a user folder -- its name is the name I had tried to change in the \"Account Name\" field for the original user, yet it isn’t associated with any of the users listed under Users & Groups. It’s in limbo. \nHow can I regain access to this user account and it’s data? I thought about simply changing the \"Account Name\" field of one of the users with admin privileges which I can access in Users & Groups match the user folder name, but I don’t want to overwrite the data in that folder. \nThanks!\n\nA: I was able to associate my original User with the user data lost in limbo under /Users/[new Account Name]. While logged in as another user with admin privileges, go to System Prefs > Users & Groups. Right click to go to Advanced Options on the user you'd like to associate with the folder /Users/[new Account Name]. Under the \"Home Directory\" field, click \"Choose\" and select [new Account Name], confirm that the path in the field reads /Users/[new AccountName]. Important: Don't change the \"Account Name\" field. Click OK, restart, log in under the User whose home directory you just changed and verify that the user data is present. Once verified, you can change the \"Account Name\" associated with that user by following the same procedure (log in as another user with admin privileges, right-click to Advanced Options, change the \"Account Name\" field, click OK and restart. For some reason, when I tried to change both the home directory and the account name, this did not work, but when I did it step-wise it did.

don't like the mention of the \"Invalid partition table. Error loading operating system. Missing operating system\" :(\n\nA: Here the current superblock of the APFS container (block0 of disk0s2) was overwritten with an MBR. This will prevent the boot loader (and diskutil/Disk Utility) to recognize the APFS container as such. \nA normal superblock (different Mac & different container size though) looks like this:\n\nNo real reason could be found why the superblock was overwritten!\n\nTo fix this (via TeamViewer & external boot volume with Catalina installed) another (older) superblock of disk0s2 was used to overwrite the MBR data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install HexFiend and search for the magic bytes of a superblock: NXSB on partition disk0s2. The first occurance was after the first ~3 GB of disk0s2. The metadata part of an APFS container usually houses various older superblocks. The current superblock usually is the copy of one \"older\" superblock if the Mac was shut down properly previously.\n\nAlthough thereʼs only one container, there are several copies of the container superblock (an instance of nx_super\n  block_t) stored on disk. These copies hold the state of the container at past points in time. Block zero contains\n  a copy of the container superblock thatʼs used as part of the mounting process to find the checkpoints. Block zero\n  is typically a copy of the latest container superblock, assuming the device was properly unmounted and was last\n  modified by a correct Apple File System implementation. However, in practice, you use the block zero copy only to\n  find the checkpoints and use the latest version from the checkpoint for everything else. Source\n\nThe size of a superblock appears to be 1382 Bytes. Since an MBR has a size of 512 Bytes, I expected that the latter 870 Bytes (1382-512) of the superblock haven't been overwritten and decided to copy only the first 512 Bytes of an older superblock to keep as much as possible of the leftovers of the original one.\n\n*dd the 512 Bytes of this older superblock to a file on the desktop:\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk0s2 of=/Users/user_name/oldsuperblock.bin bs=1 count=512 skip=3063808000 #\"3063808000\" is just an example Byte offset because the zsh history file with the original command is lost\n\n\n*dd the file to block0:\nsudo dd if=/Users/user_name/oldsuperblock.bin of=/dev/disk0s2 bs=512 count=1\n\n\n*Reboot the Mac to the temporary boot volume to \"reload\" the APFS superblock of the internal APFS container\n\n*Repair the APFS container (with encrypted volumes!):\ndiskutil repairVolume disk1\n\ndiskutil (or better fsck_apfs) complained about a wrong checksum of the superblock but fixed it without any trouble.\n\n*Check if the encrypted Data Volume can be mounted with Disk Utility > Mount. To unlock the volume a password of a user of the \"broken\" disk has to be entered.\n\n*Boot to the internal boot volume\n\n*SUCCESS!\n\n\n\nConclusion: \nI haven't been able to find any numbering scheme or time stamps for superblocks in the Apple APFS documentation or by comparing the various older versions of the superblock I have found.\nIt's unclear whether it was pure luck to fetch a working older superblock. No current backup was available so it's even more uncertain whether reinstating an old superblock leads to data loss. At least the Mac booted and the encrypted volumes could be unlocked.\n", "Q: How to merge an HFS+ partition into my APFS partition I want to merge an empty HFS+ partition with my Mac's APFS partition.

When you take a screenshot by pressing Command + Shift + 4, a preview pops up on bottom right. If you click it a program opens up, which I believe is called markup editor. Now in this program you can do most things. However, I've not been able to find a way to resize the screenshot.\nHow do I find an easy way to resize the screenshot? I am running macOS Catalina.\n\nA: Just a quick addition to @NimeshNeema's answer, you can directly open your screenshot in Preview using the button on the top right of the \"markup editor\"\n\n\nA: The markup editor doesn't have a control to resize screenshot. Instead you can skip clicking on the screenshot and let it get saved (which is by default on Desktop). Once it is saved, you can open it in Preview.app and use the Adjust Size... command under the Tools menu to resize it.\n\n\nA: I don't know about the markup editor but you could open the screenshot in Preview and resize it there. Once in Preview go to the tools menu item and click on adjust size. I'm currently running High Sierra so I don't have access to the markup editor but if you can't do it in markup editor this method will work.\n", "Q: Applescript exits return loop before complete I have to go through a stack of hard drives & usb keys looking for old quickbook files.  So, I've written an applescript which triggers when a new drive is mounted.  It then searches the drive for qbb or qbo files and copies them to a folder on the main drive.\nI have it working almost perfectly but, for the life of me, I cannot get the repeat loop to run past the first item in the list.  So, it grabs qbb files, but not qbo files.  I know it is failing because I trigger it with a USB kye that has dummy qbo and qbb files on it.\nI know I am missing something obvious, but keep racking my brain to no avail.\nHere is my script.

There's no need to allow indexing if the target is just .qbb and .qbo files to be found using the find command.\nSecond, I'd use an Automator Folder Action with a Run Shell Script action, as IMO it's just much easier to code.\nThe following example bash code preforms these tasks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creates all destination directories as needed.\n\n*Handles disks with multiple volumes.\n\n*Finds the .qbb and .qbo files and copies them.\n\n*Ejects the target disk when finished copying.\n\n*Notifies the process has completed.\n\n\nAlso, as an Automator Folder Action there is a icon on the menu bar which aside from being a visual indicator a process is running, it also allows one to terminate the process if necessary.\nSetup the Automator Folder Action as shown below:\n\n        Hint: Open image in new tab to clearly see settings. \n\nWhen the process is finished it displays the following notification and makes a sound, which can be omitted if not wanted.\n\n\nExample bash code:\np=\"$HOME/00_QBB\"\n\n[ ! -d \"${p}\" ] && mkdir \"${p}\"\n\nfor d in \"$@\"; do\n    n=\"$(basename \"$d\")\"\n    mkdir -p \"${p}/${n}\"\n    find \"$d\" -type f \\( -iname '*.qbb' -o -iname '*.qbo' \\) -exec cp -an {} \"${p}/${n}\" \\; \ndone\n\nsleep 3\ndiskutil eject \"$1\"\n\nosascript -e 'display notification \"Insert another disk to start new search...\" with title \"QuickBooks File Recovery\" subtitle \"The find command has completed.\" sound name \"Purr\"\n\n\nObviously you might be inserting disks that you do not need to or want to search, so you can use Folder Action Setup to enable/disable this easily. \nI use Spotlight to bring up Folder Action Setup and then check/uncheck the checkboxes as necessary.\n\n\nA: I was able to make your script work properly with a couple of small changes, and a couple of additions that will make sure things run smoothly .\nMost likely your main error is item 3 from these changes.\n\n\n*\n\n*You should not overwrite the thePath var on line 19, rather set the POSIX output to a new variable like saveToPath. This in turn means you need to change thePath var on lines 20 and 32 to saveToPath.\n\n*You should add the -p option to your mkdir command on line 20. So the quoted part on that line should be \"mkdir -p \". Make sure there is a space after the -p.\n\n*On lines 28, 29 and 30 your qbFileTypes var is not using the proper camel case var name as you have a lowercase t rather than an uppercase T in the original var. Change the vars to all be qbFileTypes on those lines.\n\n*For more verbose error handling I would change your on error to the following. This will give you a better idea if something actually goes wrong, and what the error is.\n\n\non error errStr number errorNumber\n     display dialog \"Could not copy files becuase \" & errStr & \" error# \" & errorNumber\n     return\nend try\n\nBelow is your code with these changes made to it.\nI hope this works for you.

I figured this out with the help of @kenjikato.\n@user3439894 pointed out my variable typing issues. Kenji's fixes resolved that issue and his reporting additions helped me troubleshoot more quickly and productively when the script still failed to move past the first entry in the list array.\nWith the help of our friend Google, one of the thrown errors lead me to this document which identified the fact that applescript and bash find don't always play nicely together, particularly when re-triggering the command through a repeat loop. \nAfter a few failed attempts at fixing that loop, I wondered if the variable typing issues had been causing another approach I'd tried, which was using the repeat loop to build a single -iname string which contained all of the file types to be found.  \nSo, I pulled the bash command and do shell script out of the loop and then injected my loop built file request string into it.\nProblem solved!\nOnce I had it working, I organized and commented my code better, including renaming all the variables to make it more generic (not just QuickBook files) and to make the variables more descriptive of what they were capturing for use.\nUpdated code below.

Is there a way to launch Trello app on Login or startup, in menubar only state.\nMenubar only state :\nThere's a window style dropdown option in Trello settings. When you choose Dock & Menubar extra, a Trello icon appears in the menubar which can be used to toggle the visibility of the app window (show/hide) by clicking on it. While in the hidden state, only the menubar icon and the dock indicator is visible.\nIn short : How to launch Trello on startup in hidden visibility state?\nmacos v10.15.3\nTrello v2.11.4\n\nA: Yes you can. Go to the Trello App and click on Preferences. Clicking preferences brings up a pane as shown below.\n\nUnder the phrase Window Style click on the pull-down menu arrow showing the pane below.\n\nClick o menu only to have Trello show as a menu icon only.\nNow you need to get it to start on login or restart. To do this go to system preferences under the Apple menu item. Click on the \"User & Groups\" preference pane. When that panel appears, be sure to click on the tab \"Login Items\". This displays a listing of items started on Login. Be sure to unlock the panel and click on the + button at bottom of the list. This allows you to add an app to start at login. After clicking the + button locate Trello and select it. This tells Trello to start at login. See image below.\n\n\nA: Apparently, this is quite not possible right now. But you can get pretty close. Though not much convincing, still it's a workaround (not for all cases).\nSo I used the good old Automator to build an app which has just one action in the workflow :- Watch Me Do\nThen I recorded my actions which were as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Trello\n\n*Click on the Trello Icon in the menu bar(located on the right side)\n\n\nIncrease the playback speed and the Automator will do it in no time.\nFinally, to start your new app, add it to the login items as described by @jmh's answer.\nHow to perform Automator's Watch Me Do?\nThere will be certain cases where this solution might not work. For example: if multiple app icon's are displayed in the menu bar at startup, then the Automator's Watch Me Do might end up clicking at the wrong location.\n\nTip: While recording for Watch Me Do, give a pause between opening the app and clicking the menu bar icon, as the app might take more time to open at startup\n\n", "Q: Using rsync with path names containing spaces I am trying to use rsync (on macOS Catalina) but have trouble with spaces in file path names.

For example:\n$ rsync -ahv \\\n    remoteserver:'/remote path w/ spaces and (special chars)' \\\n    '/local path w/ spaces and (special chars)'\nbash: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `('\nbash: -c: line 0: `rsync --server --sender -vlogDtpr . /remote path w/ spaces and (special chars)' .\n...\n\n$ rsync -ahv \\\n    remoteserver:\\''/remote path w/ spaces and (special chars)'\\' \\\n    '/local path w/ spaces and (special chars)'\nreceiving file list ...\n...\n\n\n*\n\n*The local path in the above rsync command is quoted only once (surrounded by ' quotes), because it is only interpreted by the local shell (as an argument to rsync).\n\n*The remote path in the above rsync command is quoted twice (surrounded by both ' quotes and \\' literal quote characters), because it is interpreted by the local shell and the remote shell (as an argument to rsync --server).\n\n*An example with parentheses—in addition to spaces—was chosen for the illustrative error message, revealing why special characters are problematic when not properly quoted in the remote path.\n\n*In this example, the quoting is done in Bash for both the local shell and the remote shell. Depending on the quoting rules of other shells, it may need to be adapted.\n\n*Of course, if the path itself contains a single quote character, you'll need to get fancier using something like https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/187452.\n\n\nA: The -s option doesn't protect against arguments with spaces passed on the command line, proper quoting does\nrsync -ahv \"/Volumes/G_5TB_general/Backup of CG-nas/mac drives/Fitness and health\" \"/Volumes/G_5TB_general/temp dump\"\n\n(in your second example you seem to use typographical quotes).\n\nA: On mac OS I had to escape the first path normally, and the second path escaped + apostrophe. Example:\nrsync -avhu VirtualBox\\ VMs/Windows\\ 10 bob@192.168.1.42:\"/Users/bob/VirtualBox\\ VMs/\"\n\nThis is the only combination that worked with spaces.

How do I do this?\n(NOTE: This question asks the same thing but was closed as a duplicate of this question. Annoyingly, the supposed duplicate doesn’t give an obvious answer to the question, and the original was locked can’t be answered, hence a new question. I can’t add an answer to this question either)\n\nA: Catalina introduced changes to the way the file system files are stored, i.e. it puts them on a separate read-only APFS volume. The pre-installed apps are also found on this partition. More details can be found in this ars technica article. In short, you need a slightly different method compared to previous versions to get at those pesky pre-installed apps.\n(Information taken from this reddit thread)\nBoot into recovery by holding cmd + R while the system is booting\nOpen up terminal (found in one of the menus at the top), and type the command csrutil disable. This will turn off the SIP\nReboot into Catalina\nIn terminal run sudo mount -uw /\nYou should now be able to delete the pre-installed apps. I used AppCleaner to do this. It will let you delete them, but you'll have to click remove twice.\nBoot into recovery again and in the terminal type csrutil enable to re-enable the SIP. I’m not sure if this step is necessary as some things I’ve read suggest that it is automatically re-enabled, but that’s what I did.\nYou should now find that the apps are gone.\nNote: I have found that the apps can reappear, I suspect this might be related to updates, but I don’t know. You should always install updates, but you might have to delete these apps again after updating.\n", "Q: Is Disk Partitioning User Data Sensible in Catalina? I'm a first time mac owner (coming from Linux and Windows) and so far I'm enjoying myself. =) Big fan of the Unix roots in a polished package.\nI typically partition my system's \"disk\" drive to include a separate Data partition where I store all my active projects and personal data (on Linux, this would mean mounting /home to a separate partition).\nI was about to do the same on my macbook, but realized there is already some volume segregation via APFS volume groups. However, I don't know if this has the same effects or not.\nSo my question is this: If I totally bork my OS somehow and want to completely reinstall from scratch, will the separate APFS volume be untouched?\nIt seems like the purpose is not for this but instead to prevent user apps from accessing the read-only system partition. So to me, it seems as if I should indeed create a separate partition so that any potential reinstall operations would not touch my personal data.\nThoughts? Thanks!\n\nA: \nIf I totally bork my OS somehow and want to completely reinstall from scratch, will the separate APFS volume be untouched?\n\nYou are talking About the read-only system volume in macOS Catalina changes and no, the data volume will not be totally untouched.  If you completely reinstall macOS from scratch it will be overwritten.\nThe Macintosh HD - Data volume is not really analogous to /home as it contains caches, logs, /usr/local and other non-static parts of the OS.  The Macintosh HD read only volume contains only things that don't change (by definition). When you do a re-install all of this is overwritten.\nHere is what the data volume contains (from The Eclectic Light Company Catalina Boot Volumes page).\n\n\nSo to me, it seems as if I should indeed create a separate partition so that any potential reinstall operations would not touch my personal data\n\nThat is a matter of opinion.  If you didn't reinstall everything the same you could end up with things in ~/Library that no-longer matched what was installed. The same as could happen after reinstalling with regard to config files on Linux (after relocating /home) or %AppData% on Windows (after relocating /Users). \nYou may find it more convenient to simply use data volumes outside of /Users for your data or to restore your data from backup after a reinstall.  It depends how big your data are and how often you plan to reinstall I suppose. \nIf you want to though you can update the location of your users home directory to be on another volume.  This location is stored in the directory services database in /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/user and can be updated by either\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Users and groups or\n\n*sudo dscl . create /Users/yourUser NFSHomeDirectory /new/path/yourUser or \n\n*Directory Utility\nA new folder hierarchy will then be automatically created at the new location when the user next logs on.  See Relocating /Users folder in MacOS 10.15 (Catalina).\nThen after a complete re-install it would just be a matter of updating the location again to point to the other volume containing your existing data.\n", "Q: How to delete ALL notes from Stickies app?

In Short:\nI have not been able to find a reliable solution to use external speakers + media key volume control on macOS Catalina.\nIs there any good / known solution for this?\n\nLong Story:\nI haven been using macOS 10.14 on my Mac Mini 2018 without any problems. An external display including speakers is connected via HDMI.\nChoosing the display as output device in the system preferences \"Sound\" is now problem. Sound is than played using the display speakers. However, I was not able control the volume using the media keys on the keyboard which is quite annoying. \nTo solve this problem I have been using SoundFlower + SoundFlowerBed which worked fine.\nLast week I have updated to macOS 10.15.3 Catalina. At first everything worked fine as well but soon I notices that every now and than sound stopped working. The only solution to get sound back was to restart the Mac.\nSince SoundFlower is not developed anymore I found other questions / threads which recommend Blackhole as replacement. However, I was able to get sound back using Blackhole. Especially controlling volume using the media keys seems not to be included.\nAfter some more search I found SoundControl which seems to work most of the time + allows controlling the volume using the media keys. However, media key controls also stops every now and then... It would be OK to pay the full version for $15 (however it is quite annoying that macOS does not provide a solution it self...) but of course only if this solution works all the time.\nHow to solve this?\n\nA: I have had this problem before, especially since I use a Digital Audio Controller (DAC) connected to my Mac mini (2018), connected via USB.\nTo solve this, I used a piece of software called SoundSource, which supports \"Super Volume Keys\":\n\nEnables keyboard volume control for audio devices that do not natively support it.\n\nAs my DAC is just a controller, not an amplifier, it does not have native volume controls, and yet I'm able to control Mac's output volume thanks to this little trick.\nIt's a paid software ($35), but has so much more additional functionality you may like, I think it's worth it.\n\nDespite my best efforts, I have not been able to solve this problem without resorting to purchasing a third-party software, but maybe you can use Feedback Assistant to send feedback to Apple about it?\n\nA: The same problem occurred with my 2018 Mac mini. The display also has speakers. End up using the output from the headphone jack as input to the display for the speakers. Had configure the display to use this sound as input and ignore the HDMI sound. Set System Preferences to show volume on the menu bar, as shown below.\n\nThis allows the volume level to be set by the keyboard.\n\nA: I found GroundControl CASTER, it lets you control all the levels of your applications with hotkeys and MIDI. also, it helped me with my streaming setup as it has some very cool feature \"Direct To\" that automatically creates doe you a dedicated virtual device for each track:\n\n", "Q: Different temperature reports by different apps?

It takes a bit of work and it's easy to make mistakes so, when I couldn't connect to one of the shares from my MBP, I initially assumed that I made a configuration error. I created two shares that are essentially identical (except that one is for Time Machine and uses different user credentials) and the second share is fine. Strangely enough on my girlfriend's MBP both shares work fine.\nLet's call my machine MBP-A and my girlfriend's machine MBP-B, both are running High Sierra. Let's call the share that's not working \"TimeMachine\" and the working second share \"Data\".\n\n\n*\n\n*MBP-A can't connect to TimeMachine using Cmd-K in the Finder \"The\nshare does not exist on the server. Please check the share name, and\nthen try again.\"\n\n*MBP-A connects to \"Data\" just fine. I get a prompt\nfor username and password, I enter them and the machine connects.\n\n*MBP-B can connect to both shares just fine. I get a prompt for\nusername and password, I enter them and the machine connects. I have\nalso been able to point Time Machine to the \"Time Machine\" share and\nthat is running a backup as we speak.\n\n*When I try to mount the problematic share in Terminal with\nsudo mount -t afp afp://user:password@192.168.1.1/TimeMachine /Volumes/TimeMachine\nit does mount it to a newly created local\ndir called /Volumes/TimeMachine. I can see the available space in\n/Volumes/TimeMachine in the Finder and can see that space decrease\nbecause the other machine is making a backup to it as we speak. If I\nwant to enter the folder from the Finder, however, I get \"The folder\n“TimeMachine” can’t be opened because you don’t have permission to\nsee its contents.\"\nThis leads me to believe that it's not a configuration problem on the server side as it works fine on the other machine but that it's a local problem on my machine. I thought it might have cached the wrong credentials but they are not in the keychain and the problem persists after a reboot.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: OK, it looks like I have found the answer. It's a problem in Finder.\nFinder apparently doesn't understand that 192.168.1.1/Data and 192.168.1.1/TimeMachine, despite they are advertised separately under AFP that require different credentials, are two different shares.\nIf I connect to 192.168.1.1/Data, provide correct username and password, and browse that share, everything works. If I then connect to 192.168.1.1/TimeMachine, instead of asking for the credentials to access that share, it tries to reuse the credentials from the previous share. That obviously fails.\nUnfortunately the KeyChain is also not able to distinguish between the two so you can't just save both sets of credentials there.\nThe solution is to create a mount script that logs in to 192.168.1.1/TimeMachine and mounts it directly after a reboot (before much else is done on the machine). Then reboot, go to the Time Machine settings, and point to this share as a network volume for TimeMachine. TimeMachine network drives do get their own key in KeyChain so you can have TM settings store the correct credentials in the KeyChain.\n", "Q: Cannot update Mac OS. \"There was an error in Software Update preferences.\" Mojave I am running Mac OS Mojave 10.14.6 (18G103).\nI am getting notifications that mac os has a software update to be installed. However, when I open software updates in system preferences, I get the error \"Preferences Error.

Apple Watch 3 (newly purchased) and iPhone XR\nI rarely enable Location Services on my phone.  When I go for an ‘Outdoor Walk’ the ‘Activity’ app tells me my step count and the distance covered. If Location Services are turned off how does it determine distance covered? \nIt seems to be using a step length of 83cm, which sounds about right, but I’ve no idea where it gets that from.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The Apple Watch Series 3 and later comes with a built-in GPS chip. It uses a combination of GPS readings and arm movement which can be detected with the help of built-in accelerometer and give you an estimate of number of steps and distance walked.\nAllowing the movement of the arm on which you are wearing the watch can lead the watch to give more accurate readings.\nApple also recommends you calibrate the watch to obtain better readings. Refer to this Apple Support document, Calibrating your Apple Watch for improved Workout and Activity accuracy to learn more.\nA related discussion on Apple Community Forum post, How does apple watch count steps?, sheds some more light on what calibration does to improve the readings:\n\nCalibrating your watch can improve the accuracy of estimations made by Activity app and Workout app. Calibration teaches your Apple Watch how your arm movements relate to your stride lengths at different speeds when you are walking and/or running. It does this - during outdoor walks and/or outdoor runs recorded via the Workout app - by comparing data from the accelerometer with GPS (Location Services) data.\n\n\nA: The accelerometer in the watch is enough to get from an iPhone via Bluetooth calibration to your watch to baseline your step length. From there it can get very good results for both run and walk gaits by detecting the bumps and steps as you walk, even with location services disabled on the watch. \nThis how any inertial navigation system works and due to miniaturization and computational advances, this all fits in your watch. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_navigation_system\n", "Q: My System Preference window moved and isn't in the center anymore Since I updated my Mac, the System Preferences window no longer appears in the center. How do I return it to its default position (like shown below)?\n\n\nA: In macOS Catalina you can use the following command in Terminal after closing System Preferences.app to delete the currently stored window position:\ndefaults delete com.apple.systempreferences \"NSWindow Frame Main Window Frame SystemPreferencesApp 8.0\"\n\nThis will delete the key including the window position.\nAfterwards relaunch System Preferences.app and the key will be restored with a default position. The window will be centered in the East-West direction and slightly moved to the North. This is intended by Apple and indicates visual prominence.\n\nIn case the key name changes after a system update (e.g. to \"NSWindow Frame Main Window Frame SystemPreferencesApp 8.1\") you will get an error after entering the above command:\nDomain (com.apple.systempreferences) not found.\nDefaults have not been changed.\n\nThen you have to search for the new proper key name by issueing:\ndefaults read com.apple.systempreferences\n\nwhich will result in a long list:\n...\nNSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows = 0;\n\"NSWindow Frame DestinationSheet\" = \"643 525 416 311 0 0 1680 1027 \";\n\"NSWindow Frame Identity Picker\" = \"673 573 357 263 0 0 1680 1027 \";\n\"NSWindow Frame Main Window Frame SystemPreferencesApp 8.1\" = \"9 476 668 548 0 0 1680 1027 \";\n\"NSWindow Frame NSNavPanelAutosaveName\" = \"463 333 799 448 0 0 1680 1027 \";\nSecurityPrefTab = General;\n...\n\nThe relevant key is the \"NSWindow Frame Main Window Frame SystemPreferencesApp ...\" key.\nThe \"updated\" command would then be:\ndefaults delete com.apple.systempreferences \"NSWindow Frame Main Window Frame SystemPreferencesApp 8.1\"\n\n", "Q: Remap quit app keyboard shortcut globally In Windows and Linux I can remap the Close Window key globally to something else (usually Ctrl + F4).

Does Mac not have a universal close app or close window keyboard shortcut that can be remapped?\n\nA: You can remap your keyboard, for me it was really exhausting to search a guide to do this, but I can share a few tips to do it with Ukelele.\nFirst of all, this is a powerful tool to remap every key and modifier (like caps, option, command, shift...) from your keyboard, but I think you might be overwhelmed with all the possible settings and documentation, so I here's my advice:\n\n*\n\n*Search for the most useful keyboard layout in the default settings in your mac, in my case it was Spanish.\n\n*With Ukelele, create new from current input source and only remap what is needed.

This is the first attempt so forgive me for my basic knowledge on this. When I enter in the server address I click connect and it just hangs. Is there any other configurations that need to happen in order for this to work?  I have tried using the address that is displayed in System preferences and as well as her apple ID. She has Remote Login turned on and remote management and file sharing but for some reason it hangs as if it is trying to connect but nothing happens. Is there any other configurations that need to happen in order for this to work?  \n\nA: Since Apple removed 'Back to my Mac' from the system, it's been harder to get structures like this to work for the average home user.\nThe primary issue is that you need to use port forwarding on the remote router - not insurmountable, unless it's your 80-year-old technically-challenged granny who needs to set this up, 2,000 miles away. [Been there, done that].\nEven if you are able to set up port forwarding, because you are setting up  commonly-used ports & protocols, you will then find you get a constant stream of random remote requests coming through it, from chancers trying to find a weak spot. You can't lock it down to requests from a specific IP address, because consumer IP addresses can change at any time.\nSo… forget that idea.\nInstead, look at something whereby each user connects outbound to a remote server, which can then allow them to perform a secure handshake, then hook up directly to each other, without your firewall getting in the way.\nIt is far easier to see out through a firewall than try to punch a hole in. It requires no technical expertise from the user. Your browser does it every day.\nThere are many solutions to this problem, & the first one that always springs to mind is TeamViewer. I've used it, many years ago, it worked just fine. However, if they ever think you're using this for corporate purposes, they lock you out, rather unforgivingly. I eventually gave up trying to persuade them that one set of parents lived 200 miles in one direction & the other set 2,000 miles in the opposite direction, in a different country.\nSo, you could try TeamViewer, or one of the many alternatives that have sprung up over the past 10 years.\nI normally don't like posting links to online comparisons as they often seem to be only trying to sell you their own solution rather than being fair & even-handed, but this one does appear to be un-biased. Ionos - Alternatives to TeamViewer\nMost of those have free versions for home users, so pick one by feature-set; which looks the most useful to you. I'd probably go for AnyDesk these days, partly because it's supported on most platforms but also because it's made by a splinter from TeamViewer & aims to be faster, but I've not yet tried it so I can't honestly say which would be best these days.\n", "Q: Applescript, how to mount remote server without error if unavailable? I attempted this question earlier today but finally realized I had completely mangled what I was trying to ask and also posted the wrong script code.  This is attempt #2.\nI have two Macs that reboot automatically early each morning in order to keep all of their various services functioning optimally. Each Mac needs to mount a volume on the other after they boot up.  This is easy enough to do, except for a case where one machine hangs during the restart for any reason.\nIf one of the machines is unavailable when the other boots, then obviously its attempt to mount the unavailable machine will fail.  The script is designed to run every minute or so in a loop for as long as the remote volume has not been mounted, since eventually it will come up.  But when the mount fails, it produces an error dialog on the machine trying to perform the mount, which then breaks the loop and the script does not repeat.\nIs there a way in AppleScript to attempt to mount a server, but without an error dialog if that server is unavailable in the moment?\nI thought this was a main purpose for try blocks, but it hasn't made any difference.\nHere is the script I currently run at boot time (it's an Automator application).  The workflow is a Get Specified Server block, followed by a Run AppleScript block.  Here is the AppleScript:\non run {input, parameters}\n    try\n        set server to (item 1 of input) -- this gets the server address from the Get Specified Servers block\n    end try\n    set vol to \"Streaming\"\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set isConnected to disk vol exists\n    end tell\n    repeat while isConnected = false -- as long as the volume is not present, try to mount it\n\n        try\n            tell application \"Finder\"\n                mount volume server & \"/\" & vol -- This produces the error dialog and halts the script, if the server is unavailable\n            end tell\n        end try\n        delay 2\n\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            set isConnected to disk vol exists\n        end tell\n        if isConnected = false then\n            delay 60 -- if the volume still doesn't exist, wait a minute before trying again\n        end if\n\n    end repeat\n    return input\nend run\n\nEverything works perfectly as long as the remote volume is ready and accessible.  But if not, the error dialog appears.\nEdit:  I found this thread and this quite complicated thread elsewhere that are attempting to address the same issue, but no simple, definitive solution seems to have been found.\n\nA: Using a macOS Catalina system as the file server with /Users/Shared/Videos as an SMB shared resource, and having done a bit of testing, found the following example AppleScript code to work well when testing using Script Editor from another system on the network in which the credentials have already been saved in its Keychain:\nset ipAddress to \"172.16.15.141\"\nset sharedResource to \"Videos\"\n\nif workgroupAvailable(ipAddress) then\n    mount volume \"smb://\" & ipAddress & \"/\" & sharedResource\nend if\n\non workgroupAvailable(ipAddress)\n    set workGroup to do shell script ¬\n        \"smbutil status \" & ipAddress & \" | awk '/Workgroup:/{print $2}'\"\n    if workGroup is equal to \"\" then\n        return false\n    else\n        return true\n    end if\nend workgroupAvailable\n\n\nThe replies from the above example AppleScript code were:\nWhen the shared resource was not available:\n tell current application\n    do shell script \"smbutil status 172.16.15.141 | awk '/Workgroup:/{print $2}'\"\n    --> \"\"\n end tell\n\nWhen the shared resource was available:\ntell current application\n    do shell script \"smbutil status 172.16.15.141 | awk '/Workgroup:/{print $2}'\"\n        --> \"WORKGROUP\"\nend tell\ntell application \"Script Editor\"\n    mount volume \"smb://172.16.15.141/Videos\"\n        --> file \"Videos:\"\nend tell\nResult:\nfile \"Videos:\"\n\n\nWhat I found with using the smbutil status command over curl, which on my network required httpd running on the server, and ping, which could reply even if the shared resource wasn't available, was that smbutil status failed to return the Workgroup name if the shared resource wasn't available to be mounted and in turn no attempt to mount occurs if the Workgroup isn't available.\nThis example AppleScript code also did not cause any dialog boxes to appear at any point when the shared resource wasn't available.\nNote that although testing was done with the rebooting of the file server and attempting to connect at various times during the reboot and the system actually being available, I was unable to test if the system had hung during the reboot, as it just has never hung during any reboots. As I know this is an unresolved issue with the rebooting of your server, you can give this a try if you so choose. \nObviously you can adapt the example AppleScript code to suite your specific needs.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: The simplest and most portable way to do this would be via shell script.  The reason being is that you avoid any of the GUI popup error dialogs completely which as you've found, breaks your script.  It's better to handle them in the shell .\nBelow is a very short script bash/zsh script to connect to a particular server share.  You can customize it by manipulating the variables in the top portion. The key here is to store the user's password in the Keychain so that it connects seamlessly on all subsequent connections.\nThe script is actually fairly short; you can remove all of the printf statements as I only included them so it would output each step to the console for your reference.

Make sure the server address variable does not itself contain a protocol.\nIf it helps, here's the larger project where I used this: https://github.com/ideasonpurpose/NAS-Location-Sharing-Workflow\nMinor compatibility note: this method works on 10.12 and above, but does not work on 10.9. I've never tested it on 10.10 or 10.11.\n\nEdit: So a comment above by @user3439894 pointed out that this really shouldn't work. A machine serving over samba shouldn't be serving anything over http.\nBut, it did work for me, and continues to work. My whole company uses this script quite heavily, and the Mac Mini we connect to doesn't have web sharing turned on. But, I've only ever tested this method with that single mac mini server, so I don't know that it will be universal.\nUsing ping would likely be more robust than curl, although I'm pretty sure I tried ping first and couldn't get it to work reliably. I don't remember exactly, however, since it's been a couple years.\nI may dive back into this for my own purposes in the next couple weeks, and I'll update this answer if I do...\n\nA: Determining whether a URL is reachable\nThis is something that is a lot simpler than people think, but also not usually the first thing that would pop into anyone's mind because this is one of only a few practical uses for AppleScript's URL class.\nYou can take an everyday internet URL as a string and coerce it to type class URL, e.g.\n\"https://duckduckgo.com\" as URL\n\nwhich returns the following record:\n{\n    class: URL, \n    scheme: secure http URL, \n    path: \"https://duckduckgo.com\", \n    host: {\n        class: Internet address, \n        DNS form: \"duckduckgo.com\", \n        port: 443, \n        dotted decimal form: \"52.213.95.108\"\n    }\n}\n\n(though AppleScript won't pretty-print it).  Here's a similar coercion using a web address that I know does not exist:\n\"https://quackquackyo.com\" as URL\n    --> {\n            class: URL, \n            scheme: secure http URL, \n            path: \"https://quackquackyo.com\", \n            host: {\n                class: Internet address, \n                DNS form: \"quackquackyo.com\", \n                port: 443\n            }\n        }\n\nThen it's just a game of spot the difference: if a URL resolves to an address that is reachable, AppleScript's URL class object returns a dotted decimal form representing the IP address of the server; if the URL does not resolve, then this IP address is omitted.\nUsing this discriminator, we can create a handler that returns true or false depending on whether or not a given URL is reachable:\non urlIsReachable(www as URL)\n    local www\n    set www to www's host & {dotted decimal form:false}\n    return www's dotted decimal form ≠ false\nend urlIsReachable\n\nTo use:\nurlIsReachable(\"https://www.google.com\")    --> true\nurlIsReachable(\"https://CK-mac.local\")      --> true\nurlIsReachable(\"http://CK.local\")           --> true\nurlIsReachable(\"http://CK-maaaaaaac.local\") --> false\n\nBear in mind, however, this doesn't tell you that the machines on my network called CK-mac and CK have the afp or smb file sharing ports open, and trying to resolve an afp:// or smb:// URL will throw an error, because the URL class object doesn't recognise very many schemes.  It also means that if a machine has closed its http or https ports (80 and 443, respectively), then those will return false even if ports 445 (smb) or 548 (afp) are open.  So, while this method has limitations, I don't think it's a very common situation that file sharing ports are open on a machine with hypertext transfer ports specifically closed.  AppleScript's URL class also recognises ftp:// URLs, but if it resolves for any of your personal devices, you should probably turn off its ftp server so that it doesn't.\nDetermining whether a disk is mounted in Finder\nIt looks like you have a method for determining whether or not a disk is currently mounted on your filesystem, and it's a perfectly suitable one.  I'm always mindful, however, how temperamental Finder can be, and how easily it blocks when doing other tasks.  Therefore, personally, if I can avoid involving it (in pretty much anything), I will.  And, of course, if you can leverage AppleScript's built-in capabilities without calling out to another application to do a job, that's (almost) always going to be faster and more reliable.  So, to this end, here's a quick handler:\non volumeIsMounted(name as text)\n    local name\n    \"/Volumes/\" & name as «class furl» as {alias, text}\n    return result's class ≠ text\nend volumeIsMounted\n\nTo use:\nvolumeIsMounted(\"MEDIA LIBRARY\")      --> true\nvolumeIsMounted(\"rsaref\")             --> true\nvolumeIsMounted(\"MEDIAAAAAA LIBRARY\") --> false\n\nFor reference, \"MEDIA LIBRARY\" is the name of remote disk on my network attached to machine CK.local, which is mounted as an afp fileshare for the purposes of testing.  I also wanted to test a remote-remote server, so I mounted an ftp server available to everyone at \"ftp://static.zedz.net/pub/security/cryptography/libraries/math/rsaref\" (this is not me endorsing the safety of opening any files you might find on this server, so just be thoughtful before you consider accessing any random fileshare over the internet).  \"MEDIAAAAAA LIBRARY\", I'm guessing you know, is not mounted on my filesystem.\n\nThis actually frees your entire script from having to use Finder at all.  mount volume is a Standard Additions command, so doesn't need to be used in a Finder tell block, and will be more performant if it's not.  Nothing else here or in your script requires Finder either.  That's a win, in my book.\n", "Q: Why does my MacBook Pro 2016 (Catalina: 10.15.4) slow to a freeze and report an error when shutting down or restarting? The problem:\nWhenever I try to shut down or restart my MacBook it almost freezes takes about five minutes to turn off, but eventually does, and when I turn it back on there's an error message and it asks me to report it to Apple, which I have.\nWhat it looks like:\nAfter I click restart/shutdown with all of my programs/apps turned off it will start to shut down. The dock will disappear from the screen (it pulls itself down, I'm assuming this is normal) and a second instance of my dock is right there behind it. Simultaneously, or sometimes within a minute, a loading circle will appear - NOT the multicolored beach ball, but a plain old loading circle like this.\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalled MacOs.\n\n*Shut down via terminal.\n\n*Safety shut down (hold shift).\n\n*Created a new user and logged in and out with a new member.\n\n*Deleted Postgres and some other clutter.\n\n*Signed out and of my admin account and shutdown via the sign-in screen.\nIn all of these cases, it still freezes. I haven't wiped the computer clean yet. I've been using time machine and have everything on my time capsule but I am a little afraid of using it. I just don't trust it! I'm also concerned the configuration settings will be saved so when I reboot my Macbook it will just freeze again because the same problems have been saved in the capsule.\nError Diagnostics message Example sent to Apple:\npanic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff7f87f70aae): watchdog timeout: no checkins from watchdogd in 306 seconds (1 totalcheckins since monitoring last enabled), shutdown in progress\nBacktrace (CPU 2), Frame : Return Address\n0xffffff8109edbc40 : 0xffffff8006f215cd \n0xffffff8109edbc90 : 0xffffff800705a3c5 \n0xffffff8109edbcd0 : 0xffffff800704bf7e \n0xffffff8109edbd20 : 0xffffff8006ec7a40 \n0xffffff8109edbd40 : 0xffffff8006f20c97 \n0xffffff8109edbe40 : 0xffffff8006f21087 \n0xffffff8109edbe90 : 0xffffff80076c2ce8 \n0xffffff8109edbf00 : 0xffffff7f87f70aae \n0xffffff8109edbf10 : 0xffffff7f87f70486 \n0xffffff8109edbf50 : 0xffffff7f87f85d9c \n0xffffff8109edbfa0 : 0xffffff8006ec713e \n      Kernel Extensions in backtrace:\n         com.apple.driver.watchdog(1.0)[99A75EFF-7734-31A0-80BF-FF8288E30D9B]@0xffffff7f87f6f000->0xffffff7f87f77fff\n         com.apple.driver.AppleSMC(3.1.9)[601E041E-0A5C-3B6A-A4E6-45ECC7F48A2B]@0xffffff7f87f78000->0xffffff7f87f96fff\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOACPIFamily(1.4)[9D1FF279-C4A2-3344-902F-E0B22B508689]@0xffffff7f87f66000\n            dependency: com.apple.driver.watchdog(1)[99A75EFF-7734-31A0-80BF-FF8288E30D9B]@0xffffff7f87f6f000\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.9)[1B1F3BBB-9212-3CF9-94F8-8FEF0D3ACEC4]@0xffffff7f87931000\n\n\nBSD process name corresponding to current thread: kernel_task\n\n\nMac OS version:\n19E287\n\n\nKernel version:\nDarwin Kernel Version 19.4.0: Wed Mar  4 22:28:40 PST 2020;

I wiped my Mac clean with the disk utility. Using the first aid sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. I had multiple instances of my disk which was very strange. It appeared like my time capsule was also considered a disk, so I didn't touch it. First I used my time capsule to try and replace all of my data, but it failed. I wiped every disk connected to my mac and unmounted everything until there was nothing left to umount and nothing left to wipe. It was struggling to download macOS but eventually, after restarting the process several times it downloaded Sierra. I downloaded Sierra and restored all of my important files via my new flash drive. It was working beautifully! I just finished downloading Catalina and she seems to be doing well. A little slower, than with Catalina but I am able to restart and shut down my computer with no problem! \n", "Q: Remove 'Tags' section from macOS Finder right-click context menu When I right-click an item in Finder, the context menu has a Tags section containing colored tags:\n\n\nTags...\n\nIn previous versions of macOS / OS X, the section was called \"Labels\".\nI don't use Tags in Finder, so the Tags section adds 3 vertical menu items of wasted space.

You should never see artefacts such as those. It might be that there is a build fault (e.g. accidental omission of some shielding component), or some other hardware fault that is causing the unusual sensitivity issues.\nYou should take the computer to an Apple authorised service centre where you can demonstrate the issue for assessment and repair options.\n\nA: This is completely normal. It happens on my macbook and another laptop as well, and I have seen it on other macbooks and a TV as well.

If I click it, what would happen?\nWill I lose all my data?\nThanks,\n\nA: 'Initialize' means 'Format'\nThe ellipsis …  following it is standard 'computer speak' for \"this won't happen before you see some more options.\"\nSo, for whatever reason, your computer cannot read the existing format on the card & wants to attempt to erase & start afresh. That would lose all data already on the card.\nRe-test it in your dashcam, but be prepared to bin it & buy a new one. They're really fragile structures & easily fail. You could try data recovery software if the data is valuable.\nIt would also be worth removing & reinserting the card & rebooting the Mac, just in case it was a one-off glitch, dirty contacts, etc.\n\nA: If your Mac can't read an SD card it proposes to reformat/initialize it so it can be used. This will put new data structures onto the SD card, reducing your chance of recovering any data from it.\nDisk Drill claims to be able to recover data from damaged SD cards. I don't have any experience with it but it might be worth a try.\n", "Q: Mac OS Catalina not Downloading I have re installed my mac to fresh El Capitan on my MacBook Pro.

The trick that nevertheless makes this possible for macOS in general is that a program makes sure to create the folder before performing the mount.\nThis kind of functionality is generally known (across operating systems) as an \"auto mounter\". And indeed macOS contains a program named automount that automatically creates folders and mounts according to the map setup in /etc/auto_master. This is mainly used with certain types of network shares.\nThe main automounter that most users will interact with is named diskarbitrationd. This program listens for events such as USB drives being connected, DVDs inserted, etc. and mounts any mountable file system on them. \ndiskarbitrationd uses information in /etc/fstab to determine any special options or mount point configuration that the user has set for a specific drive. Those mount points needs to exist in advance however, and they won't automatically be deleted after the file system is unmounted.\nIf you just want to chose a different folder name within /Volumes, you can simply open Disk Utility and right-click on the volume to choose \"Rename\". The next time you insert the drive, it will be mounted in a folder with that name.\nIf you want to do something completely different than the manual behavior, you could disable diskarbitrationd entirely, and create your own program for mounting drives automaticallly. Note however that it is a lot of work for something that sounds like it could be solved in a better wa.y\nFinally a work around could be that you create a program (i.e. a small script) that is run whenever something is mounted. When your special drive is mounted, it could automatically unmount it, create the custom mount point and mount it there. You would need special handling to also delete the folder when the disk is unmounted again. If you can create small scripts, the trick to getting this working is to create a launchd daemon definition file for the script, and use the StartOnMount key. This makes launchd run your script every time something is mounted.\n", "Q: iTerm2 : Adapting zshrc prompt to get the same one than with .bashrc I switched from bash shell to zsh.

I am not sure of the origin because my young son often uses my iPad and could have clinked one any number of links.\nThe hacker has remote access and takes control of the screen, highlighting words, zooming in an out, accessing the keyboard and typing jibberish, and accessing apps like McAffe and highlighting the security results of “clear.” Most troubling is that he has control of the iOS set up screens during the reset configuration. \nI have erased all data, reset, and changed all passwords including AppleID several times. I am not using an iCloud backup. But he keeps getting in during setup. Any ideas?\n\nA: The observations you have do not correspond with a hacked iPad.\nA hacker would usually try to covertly monetize your iPad somehow, for example by using it for cryptocurrency mining, by extracting data for later ransoming, grab social media logins, payment information or similar. In case of a targeted attack, the hacker could be after sensor data such as audio from the microphones or video from the cameras, or after documents and similar data. \nThe main word here is covertly. A hacker would see no benefit from highlighting random words on your screen or typing jibberish.\nWhen you have fully erased all content & settings from the iPad, it wouldn't have network connectivity immediately, and you state that the problems persist during the setup process.\nThese thing seems to indicate that you are not dealing with a hacker.\nI would consider other possibilities: Mainly that you have a broken digitizer (i.e. the touch screen picks up touches that haven't been made). I would call Apple or the place you've bought the iPad to arrange for repairs.\nAs the problem persists after a full \"erase all contents & settings\", I doubt that the problem is related to Accessibility settings or peripherals such as keyboard covers or Bluetooth keyboards - but it is worth checking those as well.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro camera still not working (green light on) - tried heaps of suggested solutions to no avail My macbook pro camera does not work in facetime, photobooth, zoom, etc despite the green light being on.\nWhat I've tried so far to solve it which hasn't worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo killall VDCAssistant & AppleCameraAssistant command (returned \"no matching processes were found\")\n\n*Rebooted macbook in safe mode (opened Facetime and it said \"No Camera\nAvailable\")\n\n*Repaired disk using Disk Utility\n\n*Reset the SMC\n\n\nI have a feeling that it is a hardware failure.

I don't think updating my macbook was the reason but I just added this incase..\nIs there anything to try short of hardware repair?\n\nA: No, you have exhausted the typical steps and if you can send it in for repair or feel you won’t break it worse by opening it yourself, a repair is in order. \nBefore a repair, make a backup of everything and wipe and reinstall the OS. You need that to start the repair and if it fixes things, you’ll save the cost and time of the repair. \n", "Q: Backup of \"untitled\" file recoverable? The answer might be different for different apps.  (For example, TextEdit works with the O.S. to re-open files not \"saved\" even after a reboot, while LibreOffice does things much differently.)\nIf one has been working on a new document, and inadvertently closes the window without saving, how (if possible) would one find the partially complete file in a Time Machine backup?  Or in a temporary local backup?\n\nA: It depends on the application, but a program like TextEdit, that you mention, names unsaved documents as \"Untitled xx\" where xx is a number. You can then search for that name to recover the document from backups.\nFor example on many systems the untitled document would be saved in:\n~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~TextEdit/Documents/Untitled xx.rtf\nIf you have a Mac where the system has been shut down, and open windows have been auto saved, and you're looking at the disk from a different Mac for recovery, you'll find the auto saved window information in:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.TextEdit.savedState\nHowever, those files are not immediately readable as RTF files.

Even though I installed vpython on my machine using conda install vpython.\nWhen I run my test code from the terminal I get an immediate return which says \"Illegal instruction: 4\". My test code doesn't use vpython. \nI have deleted and reinstalled the Anaconda Python twice. I do not have time machine working on my computer so I'd like to fix this issue. Does anyone know why I keep getting the illegal instruction 4 when I run from the command line?\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS 10.13.6\n\n*Python:\nwhich python3\n/Users/myname/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3\n\nI just wrote a simple script and it ran fine in the terminal. The script read in a number and printed it back out and also printed version of python it was using. The source code is:\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))    \nprint(num)\nimport sys \nprint(sys.version)\n\nAdding any one of these three lines to the above script causes the illegal instruction 4 output.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nSo it seems to be something due to these import commands. Although import system works fine!\n\nA: I found a solution but I'm not 100% sure its the whole answer. My test codes now run fine. I very carefully reloaded the Anaconda distribution for python 3.7 and i made sure to activate my virtual environment ASAP.  When Anaconda is loaded, it also loads many packages. I noticed that it did not load numpy, although it had in the past. It did load something called numbpy, I think it was. Anyway, making sure my virtual environment was activated I loaded numpy for my environment by typing:\nconda install -n yourenvname [package]\n\nI also did the same for vpython. Now everything seems to work. I suppose the problem was trying to import a package that hadn't been installed  properly. I'm sure I've committed the foul-up before but I don't recall ever seeing \"Illegal instruction 4\". \n", "Q: Entire \"Users\" folder is missing when booted into Recovery Mode I posted this in the Apple Discussions forums, but have yet to get an answer that applies to the depth of which this situation currently exists.\nMy Mac's hard drive (running Mojave) suffered some corruption recently, and I found myself unable to boot into the system. I am able to boot into Recovery Mode, and my intent was to rescue the important data sitting in /Users/(my username), but to my surprise, the entire /Users/ folder is just not there when I try to access it via Terminal.\nSteps taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode.\n\n*Open up Terminal.\n\n*Navigate to /Volumes/(my OS drive name)/\n\n*Type ls to see directory tree. I see every other folder I am expecting to see (I think), except for /Users/. It simply is not there.\n\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigating to literally every partition and folder I can think of to find where /Users/ might be instead.\n\n*Doing \"chflags nohidden\" on the drive does nothing.\n\n*I don't believe I have FileVault on, so I don't think anything in that category would apply to my situation.\n\n\nI can only come up with two possible conclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The hard drive corruption annihilated ONLY the /Users/ directory (unlikely, I assume???)\n\n*Recovery Mode is hiding /Users/ in a way that I cannot figure out, and this is apparently not documented anywhere on the internet. I have seen other sites/posts talking about /Users/ being hidden, but they were not referring to situations similar to mine, and were resolved with simple (somewhat obvious) steps. They were not like what I am experiencing.\n\n\nIn the meantime, preparing for the worst, I have ordered an external drive enclosure so that I can pull the drive out of my computer and view its contents on another computer.\nI am very hesitant to reinstall MacOS right now, because IF /Users/ has been compromised in the corruption, I don't want to do anything further that will prevent it from being recovered somehow. In other words, I am trying not to write any new data to the drive at all.\nThanks for any help or suggestions in advance.\n\nA: This is normal.  When you boot in to Recovery, whether it be from your local drive or via the Internet, you’re booting a completely different instance of macOS.  \nIf you want to view the /Users directory, you’ll first have to mount the internal drive to a directory (i.e. /Volumes) then you can navigate to it.\nAs for corruption of your drive, it is better to get an enclosure or a USB to SATA adapter, mount it on a “full blown” version of macOS so you can make an image of the drive and work off of that rather than risk further data loss. \n\nA: I ran into this same issue with Big Sur, and I was able to figure out why my Users directory was empty, so I thought I'd post.\nI had my \"Macintosh HD\" drive mounted as /Volumes/Macintosh HD, but /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users was empty. It turns out that there is a separate \"Macintosh HD - Data\" partition that also needs to be mounted. I used diskutil apfs unlock \"Macintosh HD - Data\" and entered my password, and then I found my missing Users directories in /Volumes/Macintosh HD - Data/Users.\n\nA: I was able to use Disk Drill recovery software set to \"deep scan\" on the entire contents of the physical drive - and somehow, the software was able to reveal the Users folder. Thankfully, I was able to extract everything I needed from there (as well as files I didn't even want anymore, but that's a small price to pay). \nI cannot offer any explanations for why nothing else seemed to work in getting the Users folder to be visible in Terminal/sudo, whether in Recovery Mode or after taking the drive to another computer, regardless of many different ways of initiating chflags -R nohidden on the ENTIRE partition, trying extremely convoluted chmod settings, verifying permissions, manually searching every folder I could imagine, mounting the partition in every way I know how, even trying to mount OTHER partitions on the physical disk that clearly were unrelated to the partition in question. I'm sure I'm forgetting a handful of other things that I tried along the way as well - and trust me when I say I tried everything I could find, even beyond the suggestions on this site, and I tried them correctly, with nearly 20 years of Mac experience under my belt. That's not to say I am a perfect human by any means (obviously), but I am also not a fumbling noob when it comes to this stuff.\nI have no doubt that in time, someone will see this thread and have a definitive answer for the troubles I experienced. I absolutely encourage that person to offer their knowledge to the world, because whatever the true solution was, it is not well documented knowledge as of the time of this writing. Either that, or it was something so specific to my situation that it proved crippling and against the normal workings of macOS as a whole.\n\nA: Instead of removing the SSD, you can try using Target Disk mode. This allows you to boot from the Internal SSD on another computer. Try checking the /var directory. Have you tried First Aid on Macintosh HD (or whatever the OS Drive is)? Reinstalling macOS does not affect any settings or user data so that isn't something to worry about. Can you see an entry for your user accounts in /Volumes/(OS Drive)/etc/passwd? If you don't then that means that all your user accounts have been deleted. If you would like, you can also check /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users and check if there are any .plist files for your user(s). You can also try installing macOS on an external hard drive using macOS Recovery then try booting up on the external drive to see if you can see the /Users directory on the Internal SSD. Good Luck!\n", "Q: trying to unlock iPhone 5c I'm trying to unlock an old iPhone 5c to access some pictures I have on there. Every time I try to unlock it, it takes me to the white screen with the \"Hello\" message, and then it tries to connect to a network (I have been able to connect it to my home Wifi) and I get the \"Your iPhone could not be activated because the activation server is currently unavailable\" message. I have tried holding the home and power button at the same time, connecting it to iTunes, and none of that has worked. The phone has an old SIM card in it, but I just want to be able to unlock it to access photos. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!\n\nA: Do you have it backed up to iCloud, Google Photos, or OneDrive? If not, then try activating the phone with a different Apple ID. This has helped me in the past. If this is not helping, then contact your carrier and see if they can help. Usually they are the best people to contact when there is an activation lock.

I'm reaching out to you because I'm at my wits end.\nI've been trying to figure out why using rsync over ssh is so slow on my MacBook (15 inch from 2015).\nBasically I'm trying to backup my home folder to a remote server over ssh, and it runs very slow.\nFirst thing I did was monitor the remote server to check for CPU/Disk usage and it's barely doing anything.\nThen I tried all sorts of combination to lighten the already non-existent CPU overhead of the ssh transfer but to no avail. Speed remained at around 0.5MB.\nI tried the same rsync job from a wired Debian server and it uploaded at 100MB/S (I've got a fiber connection at home). So clearly the remote server can take it.\nSo I thought it must be a WiFi limitation, but just to make sure I booted up a Linux Virtual Machine on the very same MacBook Pro that couldn't reach 1MB/s upload speed with rsync and guess what? 50MB/S upload speed to the server.\nBTW I tried both rsync versions, the one that came with Catalina and an updated one from homebrew.\nI cannot for the life of me figure out what is making rsync so slow on my MacBook when a VM running on the very same MacBook reaches 100x superior speed!\n\nA: 2 years later I am trying to find out why a similar thing is happening to me.\nI am using the rsync that comes on macOS Monterey; when running\nrsync --version\n\nI get\nrsync  version 2.6.9  protocol version 29\n\nI assume that the outdated version of rsync is the culprit.\nAs to what happened when you ran it with homebrew what comes to mind is the precedence in your PATH. Is it possible you were still running the built in macOS rsync as opposed to the rsync installed by homebrew?\nYou can test it out by running the version command and then try explicitly running the rsync installed by homebrew with\n/usr/local/bin/rsync --version\n\nto see if you're running the right one.\nI know it's years later but I am curious to see if the homebrew version would also have this problem.\n", "Q: Apple Watch will not activate: Pair→Update→Pair→Update→etc iPhone 7+ updated to 13.4.1 this morning.\nRefurb Apple Watch 3 delivered this afternoon.

I can boot up from an external SSD that has macOS installed I have a MacBook that will boot up from an external SSD that has macOS Sierra installed.\nHowever once I boot into macOS and see my disks using diskutil list, no physical internal drive\nis found.  Only the external SSD as disk0.\nThe internal SSD on a MacBook from 2016 is soldered onto the logic board, and after opening the MacBook, there was no corrosion found, and no liquid was ever spilled onto it.\nSo I don't think that the SSD died.\nIs it possible that if the SSD is alive and well, that it then wouldn't be listed as a useable drive?\nI had deleted all the partitions like \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Recovery disk\" by mistake, and maybe now the drive is not accessible by the MacBook?\nAlso, its worth knowing, the MacBook came with OSX - El Capitan, but still boots with macOS Sierra.\nThanks for your help in advance.\n\nA: first you should go into macOS Recovery and go to Disk Utility. Select Macintosh HD and then Info. See if the disk is listed as bootable by Disk Utility. If it doesn't say bootable, then try running first aid. If the Disk is not recognized, then see if it is recognized when booting macOS Sierra from the external drive. By doesn't boot up, if you mean it is stuck on the Apple logo, then you can try resetting the SMC and NVRAM/PRAM. Also, try using power-on self diagnostic (you must disable Firmware Password). If none of those work, then try using Single user mode (reboot then Command + S). After that, run fsck_apfs. I am aware that this probably won't work if the MBP won't boot but if you can access macOS Recovery, then you can rest assured that this is not an issue with your SSD being dead. Good luck!\n\nA: Short term: hold CMD+S on power on, wait till you land in console, look at what the system tells, take a look at dmesg | less command and see if it spills any disk related errors.\ncheck: fsck_apfs -fyd / although this does assume you can get to the console by booting internal add.\nLong term: Boot any decent Linux from USB with holding C on power on.\nI suggest Manjaro/Arch more common Ubuntu, you will have much more diagnostics available then through recovery. \nCan you boot in single mode from that disk? (Cmd-s holding after power on)\nIf so try to read and post what dmesg says.

I have read/write access as admin, but \"everyone\" has \"no access\", and I can't change this. I'm guessing this is why my volume HD has just decided to not allow me any read/write access to it anymore as I 'don't have the necessary permission', even though no details have changed all week. After admin unlocking to change 'No access', it immediately reverts back to it. Need assistance with how to either remove \"everyone\", or change that to read/write access permanently.\n\nA: Try going into Terminal then sudo chmod 777 /Volumes/ExternalDriveName this should allow everyone access. If it doesn't work, then verify that it is formatted APFS, HFS, FAT32, or EXFAT. If it is formatted as NTFS, then it will be mounted as read only. If it is formatted as something that macOS can write to, then try running First Aid on the external disk. This might fix permissions. Good luck!\n", "Q: How to save the sudo password in AppleScript?

I agree with you about Finder being slow (sometimes because it's not being used in the right way, but you've done everything right).  It shouldn't be used for any filesystem operations other than ones that are unique to it (reveal, select, update) or for accessing properties and objects that are only available through Finder (selection, Finder window, original item, application file).  It was actually superseded years ago by System Events, which took over it's filesystem and process inspection capabilities, but a lot of AppleScripters are stuck in their ways.  System Events isn't quite as fast as the shell, but you ought not to notice an appreciable difference unless you're handling thousands of files at once.  It is, however, approximately infinity times faster than Finder.\n\nFirstly, I defined a script object just to house a couple of handlers and to improve speed for accessing list items:\nscript filepaths\n    property selection : {}\n    property list : {}\n\n    to flatten(L)\n        script\n            property parent : L\n            property index : 1\n\n            on |ƒ|()\n                set x to {} & item index\n                if x = {} then return\n                set [[item index], x] to ¬\n                    [it, rest] of x\n                if x = {} then return\n                set the end to x\n            end |ƒ|\n        end script\n        tell result to repeat until index > length\n            |ƒ|()\n            set index to index + 1\n        end repeat\n        L\n    end flatten\n\n    to shuffle(L)\n        script\n            property parent : L\n            property index : my items\n        end script\n        tell result\n            repeat with i from 1 to length\n                set item i in the index to i\n            end repeat\n            repeat with i from 1 to length\n                set k to some item in the index\n                set [item k, item i] to ¬\n                    [item i, item k]\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n        L\n    end shuffle\n\n    to open\n        tell application id \"com.apple.Finder\" to open ¬\n            my list using application file id ¬\n            \"com.apple.Preview\"\n    end open\nend script\n\nThere's nothing hugely complicated there.  The flatten() handler will take a list of nested objects and return a flattened list.  The shuffle() handler will shuffle a list in a reliably pseudorandom way that ensures every possible permutation for a list had an equal chance of arising.  Some pseudorandom number generators have a slight tendency to favour items that don't sit at the boundaries.\nThat script object can go anywhere.  Then the main part of the script looks like this:\ntell application id \"com.apple.Finder\" to set the ¬\n    selection of filepaths to the selection as ¬\n    alias list\n\ntell application id \"com.apple.SystemEvents\" to repeat with f in ¬\n    (a reference to the selection of filepaths)\n    if f's kind = \"Folder\" then set f's contents ¬\n        to (the path of the files in f where ¬\n        name extension = \"jpg\" and visible = true)\nend repeat\n\ntell filepaths\n    set its list to every list in the selection\n    flatten(its list)\n    shuffle(its list)\n    open\nend tell\n\nIt uses Finder only to grab the selected files; it uses System Events to filter the selection so that only folders are considered, and then it reads the contents of those folders and mutates the list to contain the jpg files in those folders.\nThis will be a nested list, which would be fine to open in Preview without further processing, but in order to shuffle it, it first needs to be flattened.  So that's done, then the order is randomised, then they're opened in Preview.\n\nI tested this with a few hundred images in a dozen folders, and it was blindingly fast up until I stupidly opened them all in Preview, at which point I regretted that.  Hopefully you have a more powerful machine than I, because mine is now roasting hot and requires a restart.\n\nA: I know that you asked for a primarily shell script solution but I had challenges trying to generate a flat list of files using 'find'. I do have an all applescript solution though.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theFolders to selection as alias list\n\n-- Create list of jpegs within selected folders\n    set fColl to {}\n    repeat with eachSet in theFolders\n        set imgF to (files whose name extension is \"jpg\") of eachSet as alias list\n        repeat with c1 from 1 to count of imgF\n            copy item c1 of imgF to end of fColl\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\n\n-- Choose random images to open\n    set rndImgs to {}\n    repeat until (count of rndImgs) is 3\n        set r1 to some item of fColl\n        if rndImgs does not contain r1 then\n            copy r1 to end of rndImgs\n        end if\n    end repeat\n    open rndImgs\nend tell\n\nI've read somewhere that using System Events to open files rather than the Finder can be faster but I have no evidence of that.\n\nA: I was able to get find a simple script that does what I want in just a few lines of code:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set theFolders to selection as alias list\n\nrepeat with aFolder in theFolders\n    set the contents of aFolder to quoted form of POSIX path of aFolder & \" \"\nend repeat\n\nset theImages to paragraphs of (do shell script \"find \" & theFolders & \" -iname '*.jpg' | sort -R\")\n\nrepeat with aFile in theImages\n    set contents of aFile to POSIX file aFile\nend repeat\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to open theImages\n\n", "Q: OS slows down when I connect external monitor I'm currently using a Mid-2015 MacBook pro and running Catalina's latest build on it.

If you go into the Messages settings on your iPhone, you will see some settings that you will need to enable in order to send SMS/MMS. Your iMessages are working because that only requires an Apple ID but you need to allow your iPad to send SMS/MMS via your cellular account from your iPhone. Good luck!\n\nA: Your iMac does not actually send SMS/MMS messages; your iPhone does.  Your iMac is utilizing a feature called Continuity.\nOne of the requirements for continuity is that your device and the iPhone both be on the same WiFi network.  Why your iPhone specifically?  Well, SMS/MMS messages can only be sent over the cellular voice network (it’s not a protocol found on the cellular data network).  Your iPad is data only and doesn’t have a messaging plan attached to it.\nWhat you’re probably find is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMessage, will use the most efficient network to send a message; if the recipient is using another Apple device, it will go iMessage\n\n*If your iPhone and iPad are on the same WiFi network, you’re probably using your phone for messaging anyway\n\n*Since your iPad has two data connections - cellular and WiFi, one way or another it’s going to find a way to connect to the iMessage server before resorting to SMS.\n\n\nIf you want to force sending via SMS, you’ll need both devices on the signed into the same iCloud account, the iPad cell data disabled, and text message forwarding enabled to “trick” it into sending SMS via the iPhone.   \n", "Q: How to fix ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR for only one specific site Working on a site for a client, and for some reason I keep getting the \"can't provide a secure connection\" error in ALL browsers.

Over the past few months (possibly since installing iOS 13.2 back in October 2019 but I'm not sure) my iPhone has been listing my home Apple TVs as audio options when on phone calls. \nNormally when on a call you see a \"speaker\" button and tapping that once activates speakerphone, but for me the button is labeled \"audio\":\n\nand tapping it brings up this menu:\n\nIf I choose any of the Apple TV options, the menu goes away and the audio button changes to a button with a Bluetooth icon:\n\nMy concern is that I usually want to activate speakerphone on every call, and would never want to route call audio through an Apple TV, and now something that used to take one tap now takes two, adding additional complexity to the beginning of each call.\nHow do I make it so that the Apple TVs do not show up as audio options?\nSome notes and troubleshooting steps taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*The implied result of routing the call audio through an Apple TV doesn't actually work, even if I wanted to do that. Once I've chosen one of the Apple TVs and the audio button changes to the one with the Bluetooth symbol, call audio goes silent for about 5-10 seconds (audio does not come out of the iPhone nor the TV connected to the Apple TV). After 5-10 seconds of silence the call audio is restored to the iPhone's ear speaker and the Bluetooth audio button changes back to the original audio button. If I tap audio again it shows that audio is coming from the iPhone, not the Apple TV. This behaves the same way whether an Apple TV is sleeping or not.\n\n*I'm currently running iOS 13.4.1 and this behavior persists.\n\n*The Apple TVs show up whether they are awake or sleeping.\n\n*Apple TVs do not show up if they are powered off (power cable unplugged). However, after unplugging one, it still shows up in the list for 1-2 minutes, which implied there is some kind of caching going on, rather than immediate/real-time discovery. Also, powering off my Apple TVs would not be an accepted solution because I do not want to have to constantly be plugging in and unplugging my Apple TVs when I want to use them.\n\n*The Apple TVs still show up if I press the Bluetooth button in Control Center to disconnect from Bluetooth devices or if I turn off Bluetooth completely. Furthermore, no Apple TVs show up in the devices list in Settings → Bluetooth.\n\n*My iPhone does not appear as a Bluetooth device in Settings → Remotes and Devices → Bluetooth on the Apple TV, and there does not appear to be a way to disable Bluetooth in tvOS, although I wouldn't want to do that because I often use AirPlay which relies on Bluetooth.\n\n*The Apple TVs do not show up when I disconnect from my home Wi-fi, however I vaguely remember one of them showing up one time a few months ago while I was on a call at work (on a completely different Wi-fi network nowhere near my home), implying that it's somehow connected through iCloud, although I could be mistaken.\n\n*An Apple TV will show up even if I have signed out of iCloud on the Apple TV in Settings → Users and Accounts → iCloud. \n\n*An Apple TV will show up even if Home Sharing is turned off on the Apple TV in Settings → Users and Accounts → Home Sharing. \n\n*I'd previously had an issue where Macs on my Wi-fi were showing up in the audio list just like these Apple TVs are now, and I posted a working/upvoted (but not yet accepted) solution in this post. However, that solution does not apply in this case because tvOS devices do not show up in Settings → Phone → Calls on Other Devices list (only macOS and iOS devices).\n\n*The Apple TVs still show up if I go to Settings → General → AirPlay & Handoff → Automatically AirPlay to TVs on my iPhone and set that to Never.\n\n*The Apple TVs still show up if I go to Settings → General → AirPlay & Handoff on my iPhone and switch off Handoff.\n\n*An Apple TV will still show up if I go to Settings → AirPlay and HomeKit on my Apple TV and turn off AirPlay.\n\n*My iPhone showed up in the list of devices in Settings → Remotes and Devices → Remote App and Devices on each Apple TV but selecting \"Unpair Device\" for one of them did not resolve the issue.\n\n*Nothing shows up in Settings → General → Privacy → Bluetooth on the Apple TV.\n\n*I have never used HomeKit and there are no Apple TVs (or any other devices) listed in the Home app on my iPhone.\nI've exhausted all of my potential solutions at this point.

With the hope that if this happens to someone else, they can stumble across this post and find an easy win.\nStep 1 - as bmike suggested, I stopped everything and backed up our data via Time Machine.  Had to format my 4 TB PS4 external hard drive, but whats a few hours of game reinstall and updates down the road vs. losing all of our music, family pictures, etc.  While Time Machine was backing up, I realized that it too was looking at ballpark 900 GB of data on the drive.  Tried showing hidden folders, nothing anywhere near that size floating around.\nStep 2- After Time Machine was completed, I plugged in a different (small, 500 GB) external drive.  My user folder still showed in Finder, but Get Info revealed a paltry 43 MB.  THIS WAS WRONG.  When I dragged any of the folders onto the external, it would ask for my wife's user admin password.  Upon entering it, it revealed it was copy X GB of information onto the external.  Once the data was on the external I could see and access everything - music, pictures, docs, etc.  Everything was there.\nSo yes, backing up your data is key and you're kind of an idiot if you don't.

Pls note the absolute references in the formula, i.e. the \"$\" signs; they are necessary for the formula to work correctly when you copy & paste it to other cells like I have done in the Analysis table above. Also note the beginning and the end dates per month added to the Analysis table.\nIf you have any difficulty in creating the formula in cell C4 in the Analysis table, you can recreate it by typing its following form (or copy & pasting it) into an appropriate cell in your spreadsheet.\n=SUMIFS(Data::$C$2:$C$9,Data::$A$2:$A$9,\">=\"&C$1,Data::$A$2:$A$9,\"<=\"&C$2,Data::$D$2:$D$9,\"=\"&$A4)\n\nIf your input data table is placed differently (the one in the example I gave, including the header row, starts from A1) or bigger than the one in the example I gave, you would need to change some or all of the cell references in the example formula provided here.\nWhile you did not mention the Numbers version you are using, I expect you should be able to make good use of the example formula and the design I provided above as long as you are not using a very old version. I created the example sheets above using Numbers v6.1.\n", "Q: What is this green symbol on the touch bar? I've seen this green symbol on the touch bar of a MacBook Pro, as shown in the image below. I have no idea what it could mean or what it signifies.\nSome details about it:\n\n\n*\n\n*It only comes on when the touch bar is \"asleep\", in that there isn't anything else displayed on the touch bar. Activating the touch bar makes it go away.\n\n*It appears to be three toned.\n\n*I cannot interact with it. Touching it does nothing.\n\n*Sometimes it flashes. The rate of flashing is variable and doesn't seem tied to anything sensible that I can find.\n\n*It is right next to the power button at the end of the touch bar.\n\n\nSome details about the computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*13-inch, 2018 MacbookPro\n\n*Running macOS Catalina, 10.15.3\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nA: This is no icon or a symbol but rather a hardware error.\nThe greeninsh flashing rectangle next to the TouchID button has been recognized as sign of a faulty Touch Bar in several cases:\nVideo: \n\n\n*\n\n*Guide to AppleCare for Mac & Overnight Shipping (title is misleading!)  \n\n\nOnline Forums: \n\n\n*\n\n*Flashing Touch Bar rectangle (text only)\n\n*2017 MBP touchbar flashing issues (text, the pics and videos linked in the thread don't work for me)\n\n*little white box on touch bar when macbook pro is asleep. anyone know what it is? (the issue was reinterpreted as a \"feature\": It’s your sleep notification light)\n\n\nA: That issue can be a hardware issue like the logic board, top case or the connectors that link the two, but it also can be a sign that the firmware and T2 chip needs to be revived or restored. The software reload can be done at home or anywhere another Mac can be obtained to service the touch-bar Mac.  \n\n\n*\n\n*MBP Touch bar control strip gone \n\n*Revive or restore Mac firmware in Apple Configurator 2\nBack up your data and test well so you know the backup is complete and good before you either seek repair or attempt to fix this. One of the options above will wipe your data intentionally. \nTo fix this, we use another Mac and Apple Configurator 2 to reload the non Mac firmware using an iOS-like DFU process described above. Your data will not be recoverable if service decides this is needed or swaps parts. Same if you attempt to revive things - this makes all data unrecoverable if it fails or if it succeeds. Be prepared to reinstall macOS and then load your data, Apps, settings from backup if you start this test. The test will determine if you just needed to reload the software that runs the T2 chip and Secure Enclave and BridgeOS or there’s an actual hardware failure. So far, we have seen software resolve this specific glitch in all cases so hopefully you don’t need a repair.  \n", "Q: MBP Early 2015 (A1502) has died! Went to use my MacBook two days after switching on with no issue. When I went to boot it was completely dead. When I went to charge it, there was no light. \nI left it on the charger for 20 mins and returned to a solid green light. I did an SMC reset which set it back to amber. The MacBook booted and worked fine for around 4 mins. The battery was registered at 32% (think it’s only around 420 cycle). It suddenly died, and returned to a solid green light. \nI left it to charge where I noticed it flick between amber and green, but then was permanently green. Still no boot so took the charger off and went to put it back on and it’s been dead since! \nAny help would be appreciated! I have the parts ordered that’s  needed to open and try restart the battery.\n\nA: this sounds like a Hardware Issue definitely. I have the same A1502 model. I have never seen any Mac do this but if you can connect the MacBook Pro to its charger then startup, you should press \"D\" while its starting. This will allow it to check itself for issues. If you are convinced that its a software issue, you can try booting up from macOS Recovery and reinstalling macOS. Good luck!\n", "Q: How do I hide Terminal windows using AppleScript? I am using an AppleScript where I need to open many Terminal Windows using:\nrepeat while counter > windowAmount\n    tell application Terminal\n       do script \"\"\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\nIs there any way that I can hide the new Terminal windows that are opening up?\nI am fine with it appearing in the dock but I don't want it to show any windows.\n\nA: You could minimize each window as it's created, although you'll see each window as it minimizes to the Dock, or you could hide each window as it's created. The latter of which would require additional code as some point to unhide the window.\nTo minimize the window:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"\"\n    set miniaturized of window 1 to true\nend tell\n\n\nTo hide the window:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"\"\n    set visible of window 1 to false\nend tell\n\nTo uhide the window:\ntell application \"Terminal\" to set visible of every window to true\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to enter letters in iPhone native calculator app? I found this wholesome meme image online that shows the native iPhone calculator app displaying the text ur cute.\n\nWhen I saw this, I didn't think you could type or display actual letters or words in the calculator app, so I tried playing around with it on my phone. I used both the simplified and the scientific calculator. \nI could not get any letters to appear. I also tried copy from the Notes app to the calculator app but I could only copy the text from the calculator, not paste (Note: I did this on my iPhone SE IOS v13.3.1).\nIs it possible to enter words/letters into the native iPhone calculator application somehow? \nOr was this a feature that was available at some point and removed or is this a  bug?\nOr is it not possible and this image just photo-shopped?\n\nA: No, you cannot enter letters into the calculator on the iPhone.  The image was most likely photo-shopped.  You can copy what appears in the calculator window but you can only paste digits back into display.\n", "Q: Reformatting Mac... what are some files that are automatically saved? Last time I reformatted my Mac, I noticed all my passwords and favorited websites were saved.  Also my voice memos, I think, were also still there.  Everything else was deleted and I did not use iCloud Drive.\n\nA: When you reformat a Mac, nothing is really left over or \"automatically saved\". After formatting, every file on that volume is gone (in terms of being visible through ordinary applications - be aware that it is possible in some cases to perform recovery of the formatted drive, so it is not a safe way to ensure data is permanently deleted).\nWhen you use the macOS Recovery system to format and re-install macOS, you're offered multiple ways of adding your data back to the formatted drive. This is mainly in the form of (a) restoring from Time Machine backup, (b) migrating data from another computer or (c) adding an iCloud account that could then sync over data from iCloud Drive (not in your case), and various other iCloud services such as Photos, Contacts, Mail, Keychain, etc.\n", "Q: Downloaded InstallMacOSX.pkg gives an error of \"This version of OSX 10.11 cannot be installed on this computer.\" Why? I downloaded InstallMacOSX.pkg to create a bootable USB drive and install OSX El Capitan on a separate computer.  That computer was shipped with El Capitan.\nSo, I am not installing it on the computer that is creating the bootable USB drive.  Why does it assume that the OS is being installed on the computer that is creating the bootable drive ?\nSo in order to create the bootable USB drive, I have to run it on a computer that is also running El Capitan, which is weird.\nIs there any way around this?  I'm thinking of maybe using Pacifist?\n\nA: Can't you just do a reinstall of macOS on the other Mac by reinstalling OS X El Capitan that came with a Mac. This link will explain: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904.\nAlso, make sure that the disk is formatted HFS or HFS+ not APFS.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Accidently installed Catalina I did not have a time machine back up and want to go back to High Sierra 10.13 While installing a security update I accidentally installed Catalina. I do not have a Time Machine backup for my High Sierra 10.13. So now I have made a Time Machine backup in Catalina and my plan is to wipe the HD and re-install High Sierra. The thing is, is that some of my software will not work with Catalina and I really need them.\nNow my question is, once delete everything from my Mac and reinstall High Sierra, what process can I use to bring back the files and apps since Time Machine won’t restore a backup from Catalina to High Sierra?\n\nA: Manually copy the files over from Time Machine.\nJust because you can’t restore doesn’t mean you can’t browse and copy.  Understand, that you’re not going to restore applications and settings, but you’ll be able to bring over your data with no problem.\nIn fact, I’m doing this exact process with my new install of Catalina rather doing a restoration or using Migration Assistant.  \n", "Q: Cast videos from mac to Samsung TV how can I wirelessly cast video files from my iMac (macOs Mojave) to my Samsung TV, without apple TV ?\nI know it's \"possible\" because an app like Popcorn time can do it. But I'd like to do it with  files downloaded on my hard drive.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: The easiest and most reliable way is to get an AppleTV.\nUnfortunately, most \"Smart\" TVs look to the Android OS to implement their smart functions and as such, they natively support Chromecast where you can share virtually everything between an Android phone and the TV.\nPersonally, I've looked for Apps that would allow me to cast to either my Sony Bravia or LG TV's with no success whatsoever.   The few apps I did find were a) sketchy to say the least b) poor quality and c) abandoned within a year or so.  I finally gave in a bought an AppleTV (32GB, smallest size).  Doing so, it allowed me to easily cast my content from any Apple device to my big screen.\nAnd to be perfectly candid, I would welcome it if a manufacturer would simply make a really high quality, but \"dumb\" TV (no apps whatsoever) and let me choose what smart technology (i.e. an AppleTV) I'd like to use.  \n", "Q: Drivers not working on Windows 10 installed (CLI process) on external SSD running on Mac mini - EFI Started But Screen Black After Win Logo I followed the steps listed in https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/384447/9058 to install Windows 10 via CLI but am stuck at step 7.\nI restarted my Mac Mini and held down the option key. The Mac HD and and EFI HD came up. I clicked on the EFI. The Windows Logo or insignia (the little boxes)came up and it looked like all was well for about a minute or so and then the screen goes black.

Thanks!\nUpdate 5\nI successfully copied the 2 individual folders inside of Windows Support folder to WINSTALL drive as seen below.\n\nIt worked!!! Below is a picture of Apple Update in process!\n\nI can't begin to express my gratitude for working so patiently and consistently with me. Below is the finished product. Windows running on my Samsung 500GB drive.\n\nI made the mistake of purchasing my Mac Mini without enough storage. I thought I could add more later. As you probably know, the storage is soldered in and adding more is not possible. An external drive is necessary. I started 2 months ago with Jeff at 9 to 5 Mac on YTube. Then it was Chris K's YT channel. Thank goodness I stumbled onto your website here at Stack Exchange. I realize you will have to edit these comments but I wanted you to know what a tremendous service you provide. Thanks!!!!\n\nA: I was able to recreate the problem shown in the image you posted. Apparently, at least the driver for the internal drive has to be loaded from the WINSTALL volume before the dism command will work properly. I update the instructions so you will proceed with the GUI steps for installation until the window below appears.\n\nAt this point, the drivers have loaded, so you can proceed and open a Command Prompt window and start entering commands.\nI changed the examples in my answer to be from an actually installation of Windows 10 (1909) on to a external HDD connected to a 2018 Mac mini. I also changes some of the steps, so you should thoroughly review the answer before proceeding.\nLet me know, if you have any other problems.\nUpdate 1\nThe image you posted was a bit blurry. A far as I can see, you did type the following command in correctly. \nchflags nohidden /Volumes/WINSTALL/label/.d*\n\nHowever, I believe you had pathname expansion disabled. This would cause the error message shown in the image. I replaced the command with two commands, that do not require pathname expansion.\nI should note that according to the history, you entered the command give below, which should have produced an error message.\nbless --folder/Volumes/WINSTALL/label --label \"Windows\"\n\nYou should have typed the command given below. \nbless --folder /Volumes/WINSTALL/label --label \"Windows\"\n\nThis command would have produced the following files.\n/Volumes/WINSTALL/label/.disk_label\n/Volumes/WINSTALL/label/.disk_label_2x\n\nIf these files do not exist, then the new commands given below would fail.\nchflags nohidden /Volumes/WINSTALL/label/.disk_label\nchflags nohidden /Volumes/WINSTALL/label/.disk_label_2x\n\nUpdate 2\nYour \"Update 2\" given no indication that a failure occurred. In other words, the image shows that the command appeared to work correctly. However, since the chflags command is causing problems for you, I decided to remove the the use of the chflags entirely from my answer. Instead, I added the following Windows command to step 8.\nattrib -h t:\\label\\*\n\nUpdate 3\nThe command attrib is a part of Windows. The command works when entered in a Microsoft Command Prompt window. The command will not work in a Apple macOS Terminal application window. You do not have to enter the attrib command until step 8. During step 8, you will have a Command Prompt window open. \nUpdate 4\nTo open a Command Prompt window, you are suppose to press the shift and F10 keys at the same time.\nYou copied the WindowsSupport folder to the WINSTALL volume. The instructions in step 4 stated to copy the contents of the WindowsSupport folder to the WINSTALL volume. The $WinPEDriver$ and BootCamp folder should appear in the root folder of the WINSTALL volume, as shown below.\n\nUpdate 5\nI am glad to see you have successfully installed Windows 10. If you feel my answer solved your problem, then I would ask you to accept my answer. This will place a green checkmark next to this answer. This helps other users identify that a solution was found.\n", "Q: Best surgical way to archive, wipe and clean install Catalina on a 2017 MacBook Pro Long story short. \nMy MacBookPro has become bloated with files that I either can't trace back to originals or have no real memory of three years later.

Doing a Time Machine back up will bring your problems along with you because it backs up every single thing. \nAfter you have your files, boot into macOS Recovery (reboot then Command + R). From there, go to Disk Utility and Erase Macintosh HD (and Macintosh HD - Data on Catalina). If you are on Catalina, then you will get an error when attempting to erase the contents of Macintosh HD (system files). To fix this, go to Terminal and type 'rm -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD'. Then follow through with the erase. If you want to make sure that nothing on the disk exists after the erase, then choose Security Options and increase as needed. This will erase everything. Then, use macOS Recovery to reinstall macOS.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How can I create a USB installer of OS X - El Capitan on a computer that is running macOS Sierra?

I have my own AppleScript app. How would I add a custom App icon to it?\nEDIT:\nThe only solution that has worked for me is pasting the image into the existing icon in Finder.\n\nA: From the Finder. Right click on your Application and go to \"Show Package Contents\". The app will open up like a folder, navigate down to Contents/Resources/. In the Resources folder there is an .icns file. Replace that file with your custom icon (it will need to be formatted as an .icns file, not just a jpeg or png). I believe it needs to have the same name as the original file (so if it was droplet.icns, that is what you should name your replacement .icns file). Now you can close the folder, and do a get info on the App. You should now see the replacement icon for the App.\nIf it doesn't show up in the finder with the App, while in the Get Info page, select the icon in the upper left hand corner, copy it and paste it, that should update the finder icon with the new icon.\n\nA: Quoting from http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_macOS#Create_a_launcher_app_with_AppleScript\n\nTo change the application icon\nOpen [image link] in a web browser, right-click and select \"copy image\".\nSelect \"Octave.app\" in the Finder, then press command-i to bring up\nthe file info dialog.\nIn the file info dialog, select the icon (in the\ntop left) and press command-v to paste the Octave icon over it.\n\n", "Q: Issue encrypting my Seagate drive with Disk Utility on macOS Sierra 10.12.6 I'm unable to encrypt an external hard drive because the encryption option seems to be missing. Various answers pointed to doing something with the 'Partition' button, but that button is greyed out. To solve the greyed-out issue, evidently, I first need to click on the 'view' button, but I have no view button! \n(Specifically, I don't see a view button on my screen and the partition tab is greyed out.)\n\n\nA: You will not be able to do this if the disk is formatted as FAT, FAT32, or EXFAT. In order to encrypt the disk, it has to be HFS or APFS.\nYou will need to format the disk to HFS or APFS and then you can encrypt. When formatting, there should be an option to format as APFS Encrypted or macOS Extended Encrypted. You can select either one of those or you can encrypt after formatting.\nGood luck! \n\nA: From your screen capture, your external drive has an MBR (Master Boot Record) partition map.  To encrypt it, it needs a GPT (GUUID Partition Table) partition scheme.  You can then format with the file system format of your choice.   \nBefore encrypting the drive it must be erased first, so if it has data you want to keep, you need to temporarily copy it to another location then copy it back once you finish the erase and encryption process.\nFor full details, see Encrypt and protect a storage device with a password in Disk Utility on Mac\n", "Q: Where to find the keychain stored by KeychainSwift I use KeychainSwift to store my user's keychain data using my created iOS app.  \nThe question is:\nWhere can I see the data it stored?  \nI already tried going to \n\nSettings -> Password & Accounts -> Website and App passwords\n\nbut I can't find my application there.\nI'm use an iPhone 6 as my device.\n\nA: There's no user interface for this part of the keychain what what is included in the app (or apps) created by that specific developer.\nThe keychain area that is accessed by the iOS app is specific to that app (or group of apps by the same developer, if specified). It cannot be accessed by other apps, so no App Store app will allow you to show the contents of the keychains of other apps. Nor are the app specific keychains areas viewable through the Settings app or any other first party app.\nAs a developer, you can add such user interface to your own app - or for debugging purposes simply use the Xcode debugger or add prints to the console with information from the keychain.\nThe Keychain can in general be synchronized over iCloud with other devices - including macOS devices. This does however not happen automatically for third party apps. The app would need to explicitly asks for iCloud syncing using the kSecAttrSynchronizable attribute. \nEven then, the macOS Keychain Access app does not allow you to view all the data stored in the keychain by a third party iOS app.\n", "Q: What are ways of installing Python 3?

It will put python3 into /usr/local/bin so it shouldn't lead to any conflicts with the default installation.\nPS: This is just for installing Python 3 though, not sure it solves your OpenSSL error.\n\nA: Just download the MacOS .pkg installer from here:\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/\nPython3 installed this way contains its own version of OpenSSL, instead of the deprecated Apple-bundled libraries that come with python2.7. From the ReadMe:\n\nThis variant of Python 3.8 includes its own private copy of OpenSSL\n  1.1.1.  The deprecated Apple-supplied OpenSSL libraries are no longer used.\n\nThen invoke python with python3 command, and use pip3 for installing additional libraries.\n\nA: Another way of installing Python is to use the Anaconda distribution.

Unless VMWare has an uninstall / reinstall or way to clear that, you might need to start over with the database that tracks that entitlement.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new admin user in system preferences and log out of the current user.\n\n*Log out of the current user and log in - try. Also consider disabling automatic log in and restart - then use the new account.\n\n*Make sure SIP is enabled: csrutil status should show enabled\n\n*Be sure you allowed the kernel extension for VMware Fusion to run. You have to click allow in the general security pane before you can go to the privacy pane to allow Accessibility and other more granular entitlements.

The first file contains the raw data (several worksheets; total file size ~110MB); the second file contains the outputs (tables; pivots; slicers; graphs; 10MB total file size) and is linked to the raw data file (the raw data file is the source file).\nWe are both Mac users. He is using a MacBook Pro which I think is running a dual core i5 and SSD. My primary computer is my iMac (late 2012 build; quad core i7 3.1ghz; 1TB Fusion Drive; 16GB RAM; Catalina). I have used stress test software and the Fusion Drive appears to be fine : ~230 MB/s write; ~450 MB/s read.\nAlthough the raw data file is large, the data analyst can open the file and edit it without significant performance issues.\nMy iMac will open the raw data file using Excel for Mac (64 Bit version), however, Activity Monitor shows Excel running the CPU at ~200% even as 'rest', i.e. no calculations being performed.\nAs soon as I edit the file in any way, even something simple such as inserting a row in a worksheet, the CPU usage increases to ~775% and the data read rate drops to <1MB/s.\nExcel then hangs and is unusable.\nI've tried Excel for Mac, Excel for Windows in Parallels using Windows Virtual Machine, and Excel for Windows in Boot Camp. I've also tried working with the Excel file using my MacBook Pro (mid-2013; 2.5Ghz Core i5; 8GB RAM; 500GB SSD; Mojave) using Excel for Mac and Excel for Windows in Boot Camp.\nThe problem persists in each of these environments.\nI've spent around 6 hours on tech support calls with Apple, Microsoft and Parallels but no progress has been made.\nI've repaired Home Permissions (no improvement) completely uninstalled Office suite and installed 64 Bit versions of the Office suite (no improvement).\nIf the file was corrupt I'd expect the data analyst to be experiencing significant issues with the file, but he isn't. This seems to point towards this being a local problem, i.e. my system.\nI'm stumped, especially regarding the very high CPU usage by Excel and the almost zero data transfer rate.\nWe've run Excel files approaching 300MB in the past, using client Windows computers (nothing particularly advanced in terms of specs) and even though the files took (say) a minute to load they were usable.\nAny help would be hugely appreciated.\nEDIT/ UPDATE 2020-08-12 :\nApologies to all that took the time to add comments/suggestions - several weeks have passed without an update from me.\nIn short, there are two issues : collaborating using linked Excel files in Dropbox, and slow performance in an Excel For Mac environment.\nIt became clear that Excel for Mac simply cannot handle linked files which are not saved on a local drive. The data analyst and I have had to revert to a single integrated file, which is working but of course increases the size of the file considerably.\nThe speed issues are a different matter and we still haven't resolved those. Despite the data analyst having a 'lesser' spec MacBook Pro (2019; 1.4Ghz quad core i5; 8GB RAM) than my iMac (2012; 3.1Ghz quad core i7; 16GB RAM) his machine is able to operate the data file far more quickly.\n\nA: At that level of data, it’s often easy to kill Excel whether you’re on Windows 10 or macOS. \n\n\n*\n\n*Plain data should be fine for hundreds of thousands of rows and less than 30 columns for most data that’s not UUID length. \n\n*What seems to be most finicky is calculations, graphs, conditional formatting and all the processing that happens to the data and not simply the file of 100 or even 500 MB on disk. \n\n\nThe code base for 2020 Excel is the same on Mac and Windows with just some features selectively enabled for each platform. This was unified in the past 16 months, so you would need to simplify your calculations by troubleshooting your spreadsheets or perhaps move to an engine that’s less likely to get caught up like python or R. The main difference on Mac vs Windows is major feature and UI code for each platform, not the core data handling. \nDepending on your linking, you might also just need a database which can handle indexing and optimization better than Excel can. \nThese are not at all trivial suggestions, so I know you’d prefer to not fix Excel, but it has so many layers of features, that you can stray away from performance and end up with a very fragile workbook in practice. There’s only so much stripping of charts and data you can do in some cases when you overload Excel with code and graphs and conditional calculations or worse, looping conditions that it cannot self detect or alert you. \n\nA: Upon looking over your question again, I'm wondering whether at some point your Calculation preferences within Excel were changed? Unfortunately, these settings remain across all workbooks and are not set on a 'per workbook' basis, so if they were changed at some point then it'd apply to all workbooks.\nThe Calculation options I refer to can be accessed from Excel > Preferences > Calculations (see screenshot below of the Calculation Option screen).\n\nIn the above screenshot you'll see that the Automatic radio button is selected. This is great when your workbook doesn't contain a huge amount of data, but will definitely slow things down if it does. Why? Because it means that every time you do anything that requires a recalculation Excel is having to recalculate the entire worksheet (or workbook depending on how you've set things up). So experimenting with the other two options may be worth a shot.\nIn relation to enabling multi-threaded calculations, this may or may not be preferable depending on your workbook. I know this sounds counter-intuitive, but some functionality in Excel doesn't support the use of multi-threading, and if you're using enough of those functions (especially in such a large file), then Excel will run slower if multi-threading is enabled than it would if it wasn't. \nThings that Excel will only handle single-threadedly include:\n\n\n*\n\n*the INDIRECT function\n\n*the GETPIVOTDATA function\n\n*VBA Macros\n\n*User Defined Functions (aka UDFs)\n\n*Iterative Data Tables\n\n*Circular References\n\n*Cube Functions\n\n\nSo it could be worth disabling this if it's enabled to see what impact, if any, it has.\nOf course, if it's currently disabled, it may be worth enabling it and seeing what effect that has as well. It really depends on your workbook design.\n", "Q: Putting files outside the home folder on Catalina I have some large files in my home folder which are causing issues with Finder, and I need to store them elsewhere, but as of macOS Catalina, the root filesystem is Read-Only.

As of all Mac devices released as of 2015, it no longer appears to be possible to install any version of Windows 7; either officially via the Boot Camp Assistant (because Windows 7 isn't listed as a supported operating system), or unofficially (because if a Windows 7 ISO is flashed directly to a USB drive, it doesn't appear to be recognised). Could somebody confirm why this is the case - what was removed as part of these Macs that Windows 7 previously relied upon for a successful installation?\n\nA: Question: Could somebody confirm why this is the case - what was removed as part of these Macs that Windows 7 previously relied upon for a successful installation?\nAnswer: On Macs where Apple officially supported Windows 7, the Boot Camp Assistant would set up Windows 7 to BIOS boot. Starting with the 2015 model Macs, Apple starting eliminating the BIOS from the firmware. So, there may still be a 2015 or newer Mac with a BIOS out there somewhere, but officially BIOS booting ended starting in 2015. Apple starting using the EFI standard to boot macOS before there was a UEFI standard. Apple never completely implemented the EFI standard. Evidently, some part of the standard that Windows 7 needed did not exist in firmware on Mac computers. AFAIK, Mac computers could only BIOS boot Windows 7.\n", "Q: How to use iPad Pro with (LG) ultrafine 5k? Hi there I currently have an iPad Pro and a (LG) Ultrafine 5k monitor I used with my MacBook but I’d like to be able to use it with my iPad too unfortunately my iPad doesn’t support thunderbolt 3 is there a way I can get an adapter that can have one usb c to thunderbolt 3 conversion ?\nUpdate: \nModel is 27MD5KA-B\n\nA: You do not need an adapter - you'll only need the USB-C cable that comes in the box with the monitor.\nNote however that the iPad Pro (any model with USB-C) will only work at a 3840x2160 resolution at 60 Hz. I.e. you won't be able to take advantage of the full 5120x2880 capability of the monitor.\nAlso note that the monitor will only supply about 7.5 watts of power to the iPad Pro. This is usually not enough to charge the battery.\nNote, the original LG 5k display is thunderbolt only, so if you done get a connection, check the model and firmware on your LG to be sure it supports USB. \n\n\n*\n\n*Difference between old and new LG UltraFine 5K(4K) Displays\n", "Q: Modifying Transliterator Rules I'm using the MacOS' Tamil language input tool.

One has an application name \"Firefox\" and the other is called \"Firefox 2\". \nI'd like to tell AppleScript to close both instances of Firefox. Here's my code\ntell application \"Firefox\" to quit\ntell application \"Firefox 2\" to quit\n\nIt's weird because I can type this into Script Editor, but when I press save it always turns into this.\ntell application \"Firefox\" to quit\ntell application \"Firefox\" to quit\n\n\nI ran this code and I'll put the output below.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set theVisibleApps to (name of application processes where visible is true)\nend tell\n\n{\"Finder\", \"Terminal\", \"Script Editor\", \"firefox\", \"firefox\"}\n\nAnd here's the error code: error \"Firefox got an error: Connection is invalid.\" number -609\nHow do I make sure they both close?\n\nA: I'm assuming that you made a physical. on-disk copy of Firefox.app, and renamed it in the Finder to \"Firefox 2.app\". Is that correct? If so, that is going to cause you headaches. The visible name in the Finder isn't really used by the system much. The system uses the app's bundle identifier — for Firefox, I believe that's something like 'org.mozilla.firefox' — which is found in the info.plist file within the app bundle, and draws display names and such from that plist also. Unix, on the other hand, tends to use the name of the executable, which is in the MacOS folder inside the app bundle. Since your physical copy will have the same bundle ID as the original, the system will get confused if you try to distinguish between the apps that way.\nThe normal way to run two instances of an application is to use the unix open command with the -n option, e.g., one of these:\nopen -n '/Applications/FireFox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox'\n\nopen -n -g org.mozilla.firefox\n\nEach opened instance will have the same name and bundle id, but they will have different process identifiers (pid), and you can distinguish between them using those. There are a few different ways of doing that, depending on how you've set things up, but for a quick hack in AppleScript you can use something like:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set unixIDs to unix id of (every process whose name is \"Firefox\")\nend tell\n\nWhichever unix ID is lower should generally be the instance that was launched first.\n\nA: To keep Script Editor from changing \"Firefox 2\" to \"Firefox\", the real issue you're having, the following example AppleScript code will resolve your issue and allow for a graceful quitting of both occurrences of Firefox:\nset fx1 to \"Firefox\"\nset fx2 to \"Firefox 2\"\n\ntell application fx1 to quit\ndelay 2\ntell application fx2 to quit\n\nIn the screenshot below you can see in the Replies pane that each occurrence of Firefox returned error number 0, which is a graceful quit! Any error number other then 0 means something went wrong.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: If you do a 'ps' from the command line you'll get the PID for each version of Firefox. You can then kill a process by typing kill -9 PID. There should be a way to grep out the PID for each process and then kill each one.  Maybe use awk which i know little about.\n", "Q: WD External Drive shows empty in Finder, won't unmount or repair unless unplugged Symptoms: after coming back from sleep, the external WD drives show empty in Finder. But if you look at the info, it reports the used capacity correctly. Disk Utillity First Aid will fail to check it. WD Drive Utilities will fail also. You can't eject it, even though it should not be in use. The only cure I have found is to manually disconnect the drive, and reconnect it. Once it remounts, the drive appears healthy on both Mac and WD disk utilities. Happens on my iMac under High Sierra, but has been reported numerous times with many older and newer versions of MacOS. Both of my external WD drives (Passport and WD Ultra) do this. Does not seem to happen with other hard drive brands. Sounds to me like a big bad driver bug, maybe from WD. Have seen many complaints, but no solution to date. Anyone good with drivers has a solution for it or a way to investigate this further? Where should I report this so it gets developers attention?\n\nA: First, try running First Aid while the device is readable. If that doesn't fix the issue, then you can try using Safe Boot to isolate and fix issues with your Mac. This does not seem like an issue with macOS, more like an issue with your drive.\nWhat is your External Drive's format? If you will be using it only on a Mac, then I would recommend formatting it to HFS (macOS Extended) or APFS. NTFS and FAT32 are not always the best choice on macOS. Before formatting, make sure to copy and paste your files to your Mac so that you can put them on the drive after formatting.\nBefore formatting, can you see if the data is still accessible via Terminal. To do this: cd /Volumes/YourDiskName then ls to see all the contents.\nTo format the drive (This will erase all data):\n1. Open Disk Utility\n2. Select your drive\n3. Select Erase (at the top)\n4. Select the format APFS or macOS Extended\n5. Select Erase\nIf you would like to report this to developers, you can try submitting feedback to the manufacturer of the Disk or to Apple.\nHere is the link to submit feedback to Apple: https://www.apple.com/feedback/\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Open PDF in browser or Preview instead of downloading I have certain sites I have to print generated PDF documents. They are not just PDF links but buttons to generate the PDF with selected content. They used to open up in browser or preview but now Safari just starts a download and I don't need all of these files on my drive. Firefox gives me the option to preview or download on the same site. \n\nA: It is the web site that instructs the browser to download the PDF instead of viewing it:\nWeb sites usually controls this using the \"Content-Disposition: attachment\" header which is sent by the web server to the browser.\nThe web site probably changed from not sending this header to now sending the header, and so Safari will start a download instead of viewing the document.\nIn this case, I would suggest sending a feature request to the web site owner to let you have both a view and a download button for these PDFs.\nWeb sites also have the option of controlling this directly from HTML, although it is not as commonly used as the HTTP header. They do this by including am \"download\" attribute on the link itself (the \"a\" tag). \nIf that is the case, you could open the Developer Tools in Safari to manually edit the link and remove the download attribute before clicking. It is going to be quite tedious though.\n\nA: IF the important part of the question is wondering how to ensure that clicking on a PDF opens the document automatically, consider checking the radio (\"Open safe files after downloading) in Preferences / General (by pressing ⌘ + ,).\n\n", "Q: Broken iPhone screen without siri My iPhone screen is completely broken and Siri is not operational.\nI have not synced it to any computer before. \nIt switches on and I can see parts of the screen, so it is not entirely dead, but I cannot access it. \nHow do I retrieve my data?\nCannot use voice over and have not synced it before.\nIs there software available to get my pin in without need to trust a keyboard or a Mac?\n\nA: I think your question is about retrieving the data on your iPhone. This will be kind of hard if you can't access your screen. \nFirst, you will need to connect your iPhone to your Windows or Mac computer with iTunes installed on it. You will see a prompt on your iPhone to allow the computer to access data on the iPhone. Click allow and enter your passcode. Then, you will need to take a Full Backup in the General options shown. Make sure that you encrypt the backup if you want Health and HomeKit data.\nOnce the backup is complete, it will be stored locally on your laptop.\nIf you get a new iOS device, then you can choose to transfer the data directly from the iPhone or you can restore from a backup.\nYou can try connecting a Bluetooth or USB keyboard to enter your Passcode if your screen will not work.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: iPhone 11 plays random music without prompting, what's going on? My wife's iPhone 11 running iOS 13.3.1 seems to randomly start playing stuff from the music app. We don't have Pandora or anything like it on there. The music seems to play in random situations; I haven't been able to isolate what's going on. We restarted, turned off the handoff in settings, I turned off bluetooth. Whether headphones are connected doesn't seem to matter. \nI looked up the phenomenon on the 'net and found some vague answers, but there's simply not a lot of helpful information. Anyone else see anything like this? \n\nA: I would suspect one of two things:\n(a) you're accidentially triggering \"Hey Siri\"\nor\n(b) you have a hardware problem with the digitizer (i.e. the touch sensitive part of the display).\nYou can try disabling \"Hey Siri\" by opening Settings > Siri & Search and then turning off \"Listen for 'Hey Siri'\".\nIf you have a hardware problem with the touch input, it will probably need to go in for repair. If you some times in various apps or even on the main home screen experience that \"something\" moves or taps by itself, this would indicate a touch problem.\n", "Q: Swp memory no longer being used Macbook Pro Mid 2015 Does anyone know why my macbook pro 15in mid 2015 is no longer using swap memory. I can tell via htop in terminal. \nThat is the HTOP of my machine. swp is saying 0k/0k. Not sure what to make of it or how to fix it. Just the other day Swp was being used and was around 1GB full with a few more left open. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: The default macOS setup has a dynamic swap size. This means that even though htop displays \"0K/0K\" it doesn't mean that the total swap capacity is 0, or that swap is disabled. It just means that right now, there's no need for swapping (and that is a good thing).\nIf later memory usage means that swapping is necessary, the operating system automatically increases swap capacity. This is ofcourse limited by the amount of free disk space on your computer.\n", "Q: Is there any iphone call history downloader for windows which actually works?

It is 53GB. Available storage is 43GB. I have moved as much user data as possible to external drives. How do I get round this?\n\nA: If all you want is to delete the file you can open a terminal window by launching Applications -> Utilities -> terminal , typing rm into the terminal followed by a single space, then drag the file into the terminal window (it should copy the name & full path into terminal) and finally hitting enter.\nThat location looks like it could possibly require admin privileges to modify files. This would be for a good reason: don't modify any files unless you're completely certain that it's safe to do so. If you do run into access issues, it's possible to proceed by typing sudo followed by a space, followed by the line you would have generated in the previous paragraph. Proceed with caution and make sure you have an up to date backup before trying this method.\n", "Q: how to set afplay as default media player for wma files in mac OS Hi I am using a vim plugin named eblook which turns vim console into a dictionary. The problem is that the implementation of the plugin is using a default player for WMA file to play the sound file (for example pronunciation of a certain word in the dictionary). \nI would like to use afplay as the default media player in Mac so that when I use the plugin, all sound can be played without need to use iTunes or any other UI based media player (due to overhead of iTunes or any other UI based media player) \n\n\n\nA: You can only associate file types to GUI apps.

I have a MiniDP to HDMI 2.0 converter and a HDMI 2.0 cable. I connected my late 2015 Retina iMac to the external monitor. I was able to get 4k@30hz on my external display. However, I was unable to achieve the 60hz refresh rate. \nAfter some research I figured that late 2015 iMacs with the thunderbolt 2 ports should support 4k@60hz video output.

My MacBook Pro was able to drive the display at 4k@60hz. \nThank you for your time and consideration! \n\nA: The late 2015 21.5-inch Retina 4K iMac is fully able to drive a 4k display at 60 Hz. The monitor you have also lists that it supports 4k at 60 Hz.\nThe problem here must then either be your HDMI cable or your DisplayPort to HDMI converter.\nI would suggest simply trying a different cable/converter.\nThe easiest to get working is to get a simple mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable, as the monitor has a DisplayPort input. This way you haven't got the converter as an extra point of failure.\n\nA: Your issue is most likely caused by your MiniDP adapter. Most of them do not support greater than 4k@30hz. Something like this that is specifically compatible with that high data rate should fix the issue:\nhttps://www.startech.com/AV/display-and-video-adapters/Displayport-Adapters/mdp-hdmi-2-adapter-4k~MDP2HD4K60S\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a Mac-Based Distro? ElemenataryOS is a linux distro.\nBut I like things like Hammerspoon. Is it possible to make an OSx distro?

Apple delivers the asr command which is called from the graphical Disk Utility to clone user data into a disk image. There are other tools like Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper that do similar and extra tricks for backup and cloning. \nYou can delete the user accounts and home folders and also remove the AppleSetupDone file to get a new system boot if you prefer that. \nAs long as you’re running licensed macOS on hardware that’s correct for the version, imaging is something you can do. Others also automate tools like brew so you can dump on .dotfiles and install apps by recipe instead of by imaging. \nYou will want to get a lawyer to read the license if you are distributing software as opposed to scripts or methods to automate things.

I used to be able to access the local environment but now I am unable to. I think what had happened was when I was installing Acquia's DevDesktop I remember it prompting me with a System Preference Dialog Box for something along the lines of SQL connections or MySQL? I can't 100% remember correctly. I was moving to fast and believe that is what accidentally set this whole thing off.\nError Message\nFailed to open page. Safari can't open the page _blank_ because \nSafari can't find the server _blank_\n\nObservations/Attempts to Resolve\n\n*\n\n*I have checked the System Preferences>Network>Proxies and unchecked everything and nothing worked.\n\n*I have added the DNS servers for 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, still nothing changed\n\n*I have cleared the cache and all website data by going to Safari Preferences>Privacy>Manage Website Data and deleting it all.\n\n*I have also checked firewall settings and I have everything allowing incoming connections except for a certain app. I also have it checked to use built-in software to automatically handle the connections.\n\nImportant Side Note: Everything works fine in Mozilla, Chrome.\nConfiguration/Settings:\nmacOS Version: Catalina 10.15.4\n\nA: The error message tells you what's wrong - Safari can't find the web page - so we need to focus there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing your DNS to Google's DNS servers won't do anything as Google's (DNS) servers are completely unaware of your private network.\n\n*MySQL/SQL connections don't impact HTTP(S) connections - it's two completely different protocols used over two totally different ports.  If you did manage to \"break\" your database connection, Drupal would generate an error message and the site would break.  However, Safari would still be able to find it.\n\n*Because Mozilla and Chrome can both reach the website, it's not necessarily a firewall issue.  This tells you that the service is up and running and accepting connections.  You mentioned that you have it set for \"allowing all incoming except for a certain app.\"  You could be blocking Safari.\n\n*Under the Firewall Options, it doesn't handle \"all\" the incoming connections, but only the connections for built-in software.  If you're using an AMP stack outside of what Apple provides, it's not handling it.  Disable the firewall completely to see if this is the case.\n\n\nNow, the error message \"can't find the server\" is a naming issue not a connection issue.  If it were, say, the firewall blocking, you would get a \"connection refused\" message.  \n\n\n*\n\n*ensure you're using the correct address.  Use the command line to be certain - `open -a Safari \"apple.stackexchange.com\"\n\n*flush your DNS cache - sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder;\n\n*set your router as the primary DNS server (i.e 192.168.1.1 or whatever your router's IP is) as it will be be more familiar with your network\n\n*try http://localhost instead of the name - that will make sure it's going directly to your machine and not looking up anything.\n\n", "Q: Create a bootable installer for High Sierra under macOS Catalina Question\nI'm trying to create a bootable installer for High Sierra 10.13.6 under Catalina.

At least for me, when initiating the download from a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan, this resulted in creating only the stub installer (as described, among others, in the references below). \nReferences\nThese two posts, although somewhat more general, are closely related to my above question:\nHow do I download macOS High Sierra for offline install? \nmacOS High Sierra media installer \nDiscussing use cases of the option --fetch-full-installer of the  softwareupdatecommand new in macOS Catalina\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/2019/10/28/downloading-macos-installers-with-updated-signing-certificates-on-macos-catalina/\n\nA: You are right - this seems to work only if the executing mac does support running the target OS. A download of 10.13.6 succeeds on MacMini7,1 and in a VM but fails on a MacMini8,1. Given that, it is likely you also get hardware specific builds if these are available for a given OS.\nThe installinstallmacos.py script lists all available options and does show Unsupported Board ID or Unsupported macOS version in cases that are not supported but it is able to download the installers from supposably the same source as the softwareupdate tool.\nSo either run softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer on compatible hardware, in a VM or use installinstallmacos.py.\n", "Q: Apple remote desktop - Change between red arrow and magnifying glass as \"remote cursor\" when in observe mode I use Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) to provide remote support to various users on our LAN.\nSometimes i use \"observe\" mode, this has always given me a magnifying glass which i could as a cursor use to magnify things on the users screen. \nRecently i was on a remote session in \"observe\" mode and instead of a magnifying glass i had a red arrow, screen shot below. \n\nWhen i closed the session and went back, again in \"observe\" mode the red arrow was gone and magnifying glass was back.\nAny idea where / how i can toggle between the two ? \n\nBackground im running 10.14 (latest sub version) and was connecting to a computer on 10.15 (latest sub version)\n\nA: That's called the assistance cursor, and can be added as a button to your toolbar as per the screenshot.\nIt sounds like maybe you found a hotkey to toggle it, although I'm not sure what that might be.\n\n\nA: Thank you Harv for answering that. I had encountered the same thing and could find nothing in the Remote desktop help about it.\nTurns out, the hot key is the right or left arrow key, which results in the arrow pointing in the corresponding direction.\nThe up or down arrow key returns the cursor to a magnifying glass.\nI was also unaware that the magnifying glass cursor will appear on the remote screen if you click the mouse, thereby magnifying the area for the remote user while remaining in Observe mode.\nStrangely, I don't see the cursors option in the customize toolbar area (see screenshot), so that may not be available for everyone (I am running Remote Desktop Admin 3.9.3 with MacOS 10.14.6).\n\n", "Q: iTunes Backup did i lose my backup? okay so basically I deleted whatsapp and the whatsapp backup available on iCloud but before doing that I backed everything up on my itunes pc \nwhen i reinstalled whatsapp they said that there was no backup available to restore \nso I connected my iPhone to itunes to restore and it said there wasnt enough space, I started deleting apps and pics while downloading the newest update. \nI thought that during the update it will restore everything automatically but it showed backing up message again and here I freaked out because it will over write my old backup that had the whatsapp messages on it.\nNow i tried mulitple times to do a restore and it says that the backup is corrupted! \nDoes that mean my whatsapp backup is lost?

It only goes from top to bottom. When I select Build Order, it does not let me drag the } from //1 with the first class Person { //1. \nCan this be done without separate object groups for each part I want animated?\n\nA: The short answer to your question is no, Keynote does not allow you to specify which order a line can be animated so that you would be able to achieve the effect you are going for. \nAnnoyingly, the way to achieve this effect is to have separate object groups for each part that you want to animate. The gif below was generated in Keynote but it used multiple objects, if this is the desired visualisation you want, you will have to create each object to animate them individually. \n\n", "Q: Directories listed in /etc/synthetic.conf not accessible via the link Background:  Catalina removes access from the root filesystem.

At least this is how the man page specifies it, and it is the only way I have tried it - it might work with a leading slash though.\nI.e. you need to write Users/steve/data instead of /Users/steve/data.\nNext ensure that you have rebooted your system after modifying or creating synthetic.conf. The links are only available after a reboot.\n\nA: The linked folders in synthetic.conf must not contain leading slashes (and the two columns must be seperated by tab characters as jksoegaard mentioned already):\nModify /etc/synthetic.conf to\ndata    Users/steve/data\ngit     Users/steve/git\nshared  Users/steve/shared\n\nand reboot!\n\nA: *\n\n*Trun off vim expandtab configuration, or rename vim configuration file vimrc.\n\n*Confirm the two columns are seperated by tab instead of space.\n\n*Remove the leading slashes from the 2nd column.\n\n", "Q: Unable to create folder in root of 'Macintosh HD'? I am running macOS 10.15.4 and I need to create a non-user specific folder at the based of primary volume (Macintosh HD), but Finder does not allow me (option greyed out) and from the terminal I get denied.\nFrom terminal:\nmkdir /MyFolder\nmkdir: /MyFolder: Read-only file system\n\nCan anyone explain how this can be done? It was definitely possible in the past, before Catalina. \n\nA: Here's a copy and paste for terminal to set this up:\n# Be sure to change:\n# FOLDER_NAME   - the root folder name. \n# ACTUAL_PATH_TO_REAL_FOLDER - the path to the \"real\" folder.\n# \n#    Example: \n#    \"Drives    /Users/bob/Documents/Drives\"\n#    .......^ this is tab (not spaces)\n\nsudo touch /etc/synthetic.conf\nsudo chmod 0777 /etc/synthetic.conf\nsudo echo \"FOLDER_NAME  ACTUAL_PATH_TO_REAL_FOLDER\" >> /etc/synthetic.conf\nsudo chmod 0644 /etc/synthetic.conf\nsudo chown root:wheel /etc/synthetic.conf\n\n\nA: In Catalina the primary volume is read-only. This means it is not immediately possible to create new folders here.\nIn order to get around that, the system provides what is known as synthetic firm links. This allows you to create what appears to be folders at the root of the file system.\nYou need to create the file /etc/synthetic.conf, which should be owned by root and group wheel with permissions 0644.\nThe contents should look like this:\nnewfolder     Users/foo/bar\n\n\"newfolder\" is the name of the virtual folder that will be created in the root of the file system. \"Users/foo/bar\" is the actual location of the folder. You need to ensure that this folder actually exists. It doesn't need to be inside Users, but can be anywhere in your system.\nNOTE: It is important to ensure that the space between the two folder names is a TAB character, and not just a number of space.\nAfter creating the file above with the specified contents, you need to reboot the system. After rebooting, you'll see the /newfolder folder.\n\nA: According to man synthetic.conf:\n\nBecause the root mount point is read-only as of macOS 10.15, physical files may not be created at this location. All writeable paths must reside on the data volume, which is mounted at /System/Volumes/Data.\n\nAs a work around, the documentation suggests to use /etc/synthetic.conf to create virtual symbolic links or empty directories at the root mount point.\nThree examples (via man page)\nIn each case, append the following to /etc/synthetic.conf\n# example 1: create an empty directory named \"foo\" at / which may be mounted over\nfoo\n\n# example 2: create a symbolic link named \"bar\" at / which points to\n# \"System/Volumes/Data/bar\", a writeable location at the root of the data volume\nbar   System/Volumes/Data/bar\n\n# example 3: create a symbolic link named \"baz\" at / which points to \"Users/me/baz\"\nbaz   Users/me/baz\n\nNote: the words must be separated by tabs.

Aside from manually removing items from Previous Recipients, is there a way to type in an address in Apple Mail exactly as I'd like, without autocompletion?\nFor instance, address completion often uses a \"pretty name\" that differs from what I'd like for an outgoing email (e.g., if another person has sent me mail with the name formatted differently.)  When this happens, it's genuinely difficult to find a way to enter the address exactly as I intend to.\n(I don't want to disable autocompletion completely, just when typing certain addresses.  That said, I don't believe there is a preference to turn it off completely either.)\n\nA: After brute-force experimentation, I found the solution is the Escape key.  Type either \"Esc, comma\", \"Esc, Tab\", or Esc and then click on the body or another header.\nEsc must come after the very last character.  (I'd prefer a way to mute autocomplete until I start on a new address, because the flashing makes it hard to type.)\nOther natural-seeming solutions do not work.  E.g., if I type \"delete\", Mail hides the autocompletion, appearing to respect the typing.  If you then type \"Tab\" or \"comma\", or click elsewhere, though, even without another character typed, it replaces the adress with the first match in its list, and you must delete and start over.\n", "Q: EFI Partition Change name and Logo I've installed Windows again but this time on a external SSD.\nit's all working fine, but when holding the alt/option key it's giving me Macintosh HD and EFI partition.\nhow can I change this name \"EFI Partition\" and its logo?\nthe logo is a orange one.\nand I also want it to show up in system preferences startup selector on mac OSX.\nit's only showing me Macintosh HD.\n\nA: The icon displayed in the Mac Startup Manager can be changed by putting a icon set file named .VolumeIcon.icns in the root folder of the EFI partition used by Windows. Or, you can follow the instructions at the end of this answer.\nA png file can be converted to icons file by using the commands sips and iconutil. A script for doing this is given below.\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n#\nif [[ $0 != \"$BASH_SOURCE\" ]]; then\n    bash \"$BASH_SOURCE\" \"$@\"\n    return\nfi\n\nConvert() {\n    local -i \"n=${1%%x*}\"\n    [[ $1 != *@2x ]] || n=\"2*n\"\n    sips -s format png -z \"$n\" \"$n\" \"$full\" --out \"$name.iconset/icon_$1.png\"\n}\n\nMain() {\n    local \"full=$1\"\n    local \"base=$(basename \"$full\")\"\n    local \"name=${base%.*}\"\n    rm -rf \"$name.iconset\"\n    mkdir \"$name.iconset\"\n    Convert \"16x16\"\n    Convert \"16x16@2x\"\n    Convert \"32x32\"\n    Convert \"32x32@2x\"\n    Convert \"128x128\"\n    Convert \"128x128@2x\"\n    Convert \"256x256\"\n    Convert \"256x256@2x\"\n    Convert \"512x512\"\n    Convert \"512x512@2x\"\n    iconutil -c icns \"$name.iconset\"\n    rm -r \"$name.iconset\"\n}\nset -u\nMain \"$@\"\n\nFor example, if you were to download this Windows 10 logo png file to the same folder as the script file, then the command given below would replace the png file with a icns file. Here, the script file is named createicns and Windows10.png is the png file. The result would be the creation a Windows10.icns file, which you would rename .VolumeIcon.icns.\n./createicns Windows10.png\n\n\nYou can also download icns files for various operating systems from this website. I converted the Windows 10 logo png file and posted here for download. The file name is Windows10.icns.\n\nThe label displayed in the Mac Startup Manager can be changed by using the bless command. Assuming diskutil list shows your external drive is disk2 and the EFI partition is first on the drive, then command below would mount this partition.\nsudo diskutil mount disk2s1\n\nAssuming the EFI volume is labeled EFI, then the command below would change the label to Windows.\nbless --folder /Volumes/EFI/efi/boot --label \"Windows\"\n\nThis command creates the two hidden files given below.\n.disk_label\n.disk_label_2x\n\nAfterwards, the command given below can unmount the EFI partition.\ndiskutil unmount disk2s1\n\nThe Start Disk pane in System Preferences may not shown an Windows installation on an external drive. Or, if the installation does appear, you may not be able to successfully select the installation. AFAIK there is no fix for this.\nThere is an alternative where rEFInd can be used to select the default operation system directly from Windows, macOS and most Linux installations. However this requires installing a GUI script in each operation system as well as installing and configuring rEFInd.\nContents of an icns File\nThe contents of a icns file can vary depending on the version of OS X or macOS you are using. The table below can be used to compare the differences between an icns file create using El Capitan (OS X 10.11.6) and one created using Catalina (MacOS 10.15.4). Both files were creating using the same script as given above.

This includes CPU, GPU, SSD and other expensive components. What a waste just because of a small BT chip is dead.\nThe company doing the maintenance told that they were unable to detect anything was wrong using their tests, but could not get the BT working. Glad it fell under warranty.\n\nA: I have been able to solve this exact problem by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown the Mac completely\n\n*Plugin any supported usb bluetooth dongle while Mac is off\n\n*Start the Mac and login to the system\n\n*Use bluetooth to find and connect to some bluetooth device (propably optional step)\n\n*Remove the usb bluetooth dongle\n\n*Internal bluetooth started to work again normally\n\n\nAlso if this doesn't work first time you might want to repeat few times and try combinations where you shutdown the Mac with and without the dongle and startup the same way with and without the dongle. \n--\nBefore this I also did following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset NVRAM\n\n*Reset SMC \n\n*Reset the bluetooth module\n\n*Remove bluetooth.plist\n\n*Used bluetooth explorer.app\n\n*Booted to recovery (CMD+R) on startup\n\n\n--\nI think this is some kind of firmware related problem where call to re-enable internal bluetooth is not executed properly in certain situations leaving the bluetooth in unusable state.\nSolution in my case was insipired by similar headphone jack problems on older models where Mac thought that jack was plugged in and disabled onboard speakers even if no jack was connected.\n\nA: I have the same problem with my MacBook Pro 2019 16\". I've connected a BT dongle via an USB-C hub for testing purposes. Without the USB BT dongle, I can't connect to BT devices. Interesting fact: the USB Dongle is the only controller that is available within th Apple Bluetooth Explorer Utility.\n\n\nA: I have MacBookPro 16 from 2020. In my case non of those tips helped. However installing backup from Time Machine (before attaching dongle) solved issue.\nEDIT:\nIt stopped working after a few hours.\nFresh install did not help.

I didn't see this question asked or could find any answers when I Googled but I thought history -c would clear all my Bash history but there are still several files in .bash_sessions located under /Users/user/.bash_sessions. \nWhat is the difference between these files and the bash history file of .bash_history? Can the files in this directory (/.bash_sessions) be deleted safely? There are over 200 files with random letters, numbers and dashes followed by the extensions of .historynew, .history and .session.\n\nA: A session file is commands from a single session.\nThe history is an incomplete collection of commands used in any session.\nI don't know for sure whether anything (other than loss of history) would occur from deleting them, but I suspect not.  An easy test would be move them all to another directory, then move them back if you see a problem.\n\nA: As long as you do not need the shell session history information stored for any reason, then to stop the .history and .historynew files from being created, you can add SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY=0 to your ~/.bash_profilefile or ~/.bashrc file and restart Terminal and it will stop creating those files.\nIf you do not want the .session files, then in your $HOME directory use touch .bash_sessions_disable.

Or maybe it's not even listed. If you use the non-default scaled resolutions, they don't look quite right to my eyes, and so I want to know how small or large everything is. Most software doesn't factor in hardware pixels when choosing what size to display.\nFor example, the Macbook Pro 16-inch has a native 3072x1920 resolution, and its supported scaled resolutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*2048 x 1280\n\n*1792 x 1120\n\n*1344 x 840\n\n*1152 x 720\n\n\n#2 is the effective resolution when running in default retina mode, giving the Macbook Pro a PPI of 132.08\n\nA: By default, Mac Retina displays are always at scaled to 2x the 'actual' resolution. So a 2560 x 1600 display will be a \"Hi-res\" version of 1280 x 800.\nI suspect that Apple's list of \"supported scaled resolutions\" does not include the default 2x Retina setting. \nThis is backed up by the wording used on my 15\" MBP:\n\n2880 by 1800 pixels (Retina); scaled resolutions: 1920 by 1200, 1680\nby 1050, 1280 by 800, and 1024 by 640 pixels\n\nThe Scaling options in System Preferences offer 5 options: four of them being the scaled sizes and the middle button being the default. (I'm hovering the mouse over the 2nd from left in the the image.)\n\nThe 16\" MBP's default resolution is 1536 x 960 \"Hi-res\".\nYou are right that \"most software doesn't factor in hardware pixels when choosing what size to display\" - that's the job of the OS. MacOS's use of 2x scaling is designed to be the clearest.\nIf the non-default scaled resolutions don't look right to your eyes (understandably so), then just use the default.\n\nA: To quickly assure yourself of the current logical resolution: Press CMD+Shift+4 to capture part of the screen, and the coordinates will be shown next to the cursor. Move the cursor to the lower right corner to see the resolution (you will have to add one to each coordinate).\nAlternatively, in this same mode, drag from one corner to the opposite one to select the whole screen, and the size will display in full, no addition required.\n\nA: Retina mode is to use multiple pixels for a virtual point. So the cleanest scaled resolution would be if you scaled the native resolution by a whole number. For my 15 inch version the native 2880x1800 should be scaled to 1440x900 giving 2x scaling and 4 pixels per point. This holds up as this resolution looks sharpest out of all the options offered.\nThe Air's 2560x1600 scaled at 2x would be 1280x800. But it isn't offered so your choices are:\n\n\n*\n\n*1680x1050 is almost 1.5 perfectly \n\n*1440x900 is 1.7 repeating, and \n\n*1024x640 is 2.5 exactly. \n\n\nThe almost 1.5x scaling seems to be the best of the choices offered in terms of sharpness. But the text might be too small for some users. You can also try an app to switch to the 2560x1600 resolution, like RDM (Retina Display Manager).\n", "Q: Should I use Wi-Fi and Ethernet at the same time? I'm on macOS Mojave, and was wondering if I should have Wi-Fi and Ethernet on at the same? Are there advantages to keeping on at the same time, or will doing something like this cause any problems or interferences? Thanks for any information on this! \n\nA: There shouldn’t be a problem with keeping both on at all times. Your machine will choose one automatically and everything will work. You can also increase the priority of one system over the other so that your chosen system will be used if available.\nAll things being equal Ethernet is sometimes faster due to WiFi devices slowing down when lots of devices and access points are close together (like in apartments). If you need gigabit network speeds then Ethernet will usually be faster as you generally need to be close to your access point for gigabit WiFi speeds.\nAirDrop requires WiFi as it directly connects two devices. Other than AirDrop needing WiFi and the generally better speeds with less interference on Ethernet there is no reason for preferring one over the other.\n", "Q: If photos are retrieved from a damaged iPhone, will their quality be the same as when they were taken? An iPhone XS has been subject water to both physical and heat damage, however, the photos are still accessible when connected to a computer. Can physical damage to an iPhone also affect the quality of the photos taken on it?\n\nA: No. The storage in phones is quite durable. As long as the photos are accessible the quality should not change. \nThe damage would need to happen in a unique way for the quality to be affected before the accessibility is affected. The phone has to pretend to be a camera for the photos to show up and the phone can also be set to block USB access if not unlocked.

No matter how many times I change the space I'm using, it keeps reverting back to the one where safari is open.\nAny ideas on what might be causing this, or how I can fix it? I use Spaces a lot for my workflow and this basically renders them unusable while safari is open. \n\nA: I am having the exact same issue. Safari kept stealing focus no matter which fullscreen app I would move to. It only does this when moving to a fullscreen app. I found a workaround that keeps it from switching completely away from the fullscreen apps. \nI unchecked \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\" in Mission Control. And this stops it from moving back to wherever Safari is open across spaces or screens (running with an external monitor). \nThis doesn't fix the problem completely as Safari is still technically stealing focus as apps will basically twitch and the Touchbar will switch to Safari displaying the \"New Window\" \"New Private Window\" buttons. When switching to Google Chrome, the top part of the app will drop slightly as if the menu bar was being selected and then you have to click into Chrome again to get the focus back to chrome. \n\nA: As @kcappy suggested, if you use \"OnScreen Control\" by LG then close it to solve this issue. \n", "Q: Unable to deploy Mobile Config for Active Sync on iOS 13.4.1 I'm trying to deploy a mobile configuration for a number of iPhones.

The key is what takes that “mess” and turns it into usable data.\nRecovery programs can’t rescue your data because a) they can’t distinguish between the encryption you did the first time versus the second, and b) being encrypted it can’t “see” the actual file structure to associate what blocks go with what.  This is why and how encryption protects your data from nefarious actors; your data can’t be recovered.\nThis is also why having a backup is extra critical when you go this route.\n", "Q: What is the difference between developer.apple.com and iTunes Connect?

Often, I've got my MacBook Pro connected to  power when I'm working from the office. At home, I often leave it unplugged until the battery is too low to continue at which point I plug it in.\nThe problem occurs when my device is connected to a power supply. My battery indicator shows 100% charge which is fine. But sometimes the battery starts draining and the menu bar icon says \"Battery not charging,\" even when it's connected to a wall socket, and it keeps draining until absolutely dry. It doesn't even warn me the battery is running low because it shows \"Power source: Power adapter\" which I guess disables the Operating system low-battery warning. This has happened on multiple occasions.\nI've already tried several things, I've swapped chargers, swapped wall sockets, started with as few tools/apps running as possible. But the problem comes back. I also can't really tie this to a specific app or behavior,  AFAIK.\nDoes anyone know what might be causing this behavior and what to possibly do about it?\n\n\nA: There are two things that can be attributed to this:\n\n*\n\n*There is a technical issue with your charger\n\n*The Battery Health Management feature (released in Catalina) can make it appear you have a charging issue.\n\nWrong charger\nYou are likely using the wrong power adapter; it's too \"small\" for your particular MacBook.  Your machine requires the 87W power adapter.\nIf you take a look at Apple's support document Find the right power adapter and cable for your Mac notebook under the USB section, you'll notice that all of the adapters from the 29W that charges the MacBook to the 91W that charges the 16\" MacBook Pro all look identical so it's quite easy to mix them up. While you can plug in any of these into any of the MacBook computers (plain, Air, or Pro) and while it will \"charge,\" you won't get optimal results.\n\n*\n\n*A \"larger\" charger can be used to power a \"smaller\" device.  In other words, you can use the 91W charger from the 16\" MBP to power/charge the 2015 MBA that only required the 29W charger.\n\n*A \"smaller\" charger should not be used to power a \"larger\" device.  While USB-C will negotiate the power being delivered, if the adapter cannot supply the requested current, it simply won't be there.\n\nWhat you're experiencing is what's in the second  point.  The adapter is connected (and detected) but it simply cannot supply enough power to charge and for you use the computer at the same time.  If you notice, Coconut battery is reporting that it's charging with only 49W, yet the battery isn't charging.  You're likely using the 61W adapter. (That number is a misnomer because that current is what it's drawing from the power adapter current, not what's going to the battery).\nBattery Health Management in Catalina\nAs of Catalina (10.15.5) Apple has implemented a feature called Battery Health Management that will stop charging and allow it to discharge to a predetermined charge (about 80%) before recharging again. This happens even while the charger is plugged in and working.\nYou can learn more about Catalina’s Battery Health Management feature in the Apple Support Document About battery health management in Mac notebooks\nTherefore, assuming you're using the correct wattage charging adapter, this could be perfectly normal behavior.\n\nA: What helps me (it's not a real solution but better than nothing) is:\nAs soon as I see it misbehave I unplug the cord from the power supply and plug it back in. This resets something and it goes back to normal for a while.\n\nA: It's not 100% solved but I've experienced the problem a lot less since I started consistently charging my MacBook from the right side instead of left. There is some correlation between overheating and stopping charging but I haven't pinned the issue down just yet. But what I can tell is that when the MacBook stops charging (even when plugged in) it feels hot to the touch (and temperature sensors also indicate increasing heat being generated).\nThe battery drain did, however, occur again once or twice in the last 6 months but that was when my MacBook was under great stress due to running docker and zoom (with encryption enabled) at the same time.\nSo it just might be a hardware overheating issue that's kind of solved by switching site side you charge your MacBook. ‍♂️\n\nA: I had this same problem and it stumped me for months. I swapped three different chargers and nothing worked!\nIt turned out that the problem was due to the USB-C cable going from the charger to the Macbook and I never noticed because when I was swapping out the chargers I was re-using that particular cord. The USB-C cord I had been using was apparently only able to carry about 85 Watts.\nLong story short: When you swap out the charger, make sure you swap out ALL of the cables (including the USB-C one) with brand new ones.\n", "Q: Formatted hd disk wrong.

The external drive was getting close to be being full so I moved all the backed up file folders to my Recycle Bin (Trash) on my Desktop to permanently delete them. When I go try and empty the trash though it is taking forever because there's so many files in there now. Does anyone know if there is a quicker way around this - a way to delete these files and get them out of the trash without it taking hours or days? Thank you!\n\nA: If the drive is getting close to be being full, TM will free the space automatically.\nYou can empty the Trash (delete the files) much faster with Terminal command\nrm -rf ~/.Trash/*\n\nHowever, you will probably corrupt your entire backup by deleting specific TM snapshots (folders with datetime in the name).

I ended up with a \"6.53 GB\" Ram Disk. The question is does hdiutil calculate block sizes as 512 bytes or 500 bytes?\nThe old way was:\n1 block = 512 bytes\n 2 blocks = 1024 bytes (KB) \n1024 bytes X 1024 = 1048576 bytes (MB) \n1048576 bytes x 1024 = 1073741824 bytes (GB)\n1073741824 bytes / 512 = 2097152 blocks per GB\nBut maybe storage is now calculated differently:\n1 block = 500 bytes \n2 blocks = 1000 bytes (KB) \n1000 bytes X 1000 = 1000000 bytes (MB) \n1000000 bytes x 1000 = 1000000000 bytes (GB)\n1000000000 bytes / 500 = 2000000 blocks per GB\nEDIT: Just tested this myself and ended up with these numbers which seems to indicate that hdiutil does indeed use 500 byte block size for calculation.

A clone will be specific to your machine.  If it’s a 2015 (for example) and it gets lost/stolen or sent in for repairs and a kind soul loans you a 2013 model, that clone is useless as it won’t function on an older machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to backup Time Machine's backup to a cloud?\n\n*Offsite Backup Strategy for Multiple Macs\n\n*How to backup data from one external drive to another (one-way)\n\n*What's a good setup to back up macOS data and restore to Linux?\n(IMO) a clone isn’t necessary anymore especially if you’re using APFS as it has a built in snapshot feature that allows you to make an immediate point in time backup of your drive. Instead, put together a strong backup strategy that allows you to get up and running quickly.\nAnd speaking from personal experience, while I have a Time a Machine backups, when I upgraded to Catalina I didn’t even do a migration.

In fact, I long ago began using an external Thunderbolt drive for macOS and documents; now using Mojave 10.14.6.\nI no longer use the internal drive(s). I also disassociated the two parts of the Fusion drive and reformatted them as 2 separate drives, one becoming a 120GB SSD, and the other a larger hard disk drive. The Fusion drive is labeled as follows: “Type: SATA Internal Physical Volume” “Device: disk1s2”. The SSD part of the disk still usually mounts. The SATA hard drive only mounts occasionally at start-up, and often dismounts itself after unsuccessfully getting stuck reading. (It will show up for a while sometimes and start to show the hierarchy, before shutting down.)\nI prefer not to physically open the iMac to remove the drive (apparently, it's not a simple operation).\nMy big problem is the noise from the internal disk trying to spin. \nI would like to completely disable the internal Fusion drive. I see some suggestions online from many years ago, and many previous versions of macOS, using Terminal commands, but am unsure if they would still work, and I don’t have much experience.\nSuggestions? (This Mac has run 24 hours a day since 2012. I’m not tossing it. It still works great.)\n\nA: \nI want to completely stop my internal fusion drive from powering up, since I no longer use it and it is very noisy.\n\nYou cannot prevent your mechanical drive from powering up.\nIt’s a standard 3.5” SATA hard drive with a power connector directly connected to the power supply.  There’s no switch or command you can issue that will cut off the power to the drive.  Repartitioning it and wiping it clean won’t prevent it from spinning up and doing its periodic reads.  \n\nThe only solution is to disconnect it. \nHowever, since you have to go through the trouble of cutting through the adhesive holding the glass, you might as well upgrade the drive to an SSD.  I’ve done this exact procedure - it’s not difficult, just time consuming.  \n", "Q: Automatic call audio routing still asking for device I have recently purchased new airpods and they were working good, but yesterday I think I didn't pair them properly and tried to make a phone call.

I went to:\nBluetooth settings -> MyAirPodsName -> forget this device\n\nThen I paired my airpods again with my phone and tried to make a phone call. And sure it worked! Now when I have my airpods connected it chooses them automatically, if not, I can switch between \"iPhone\" and \"speaker\" as they are named in the list by tapping the speaker button. \nI think it is some weird bug that prevents the call audio routing from selecting the device automatically so you have to select it explicitly everytime you call someone...

Only then should you think about upgrading or messing with BootCamp.\n\"What can be done to fix this without losing all the data I have on the hard drive?\"\nBackup your disk. The only way to ensure that you will not lose any files is to have at least one copy on another physical device. Then, if something goes wrong with this disk, you will still have your files.\nA Fusion drive is made of two separate devices: an SSD and a mechanical hard drive. Two devices means two separate points of failure. The mechanical hard drive is much more vulnerable to breakdown than the SSD. If one part of the Fusion drive breaks, then EVERYTHING is lost.\nYou may be able to 'repair' the Fusion by erasing the disk: or the errors may be so great that nothing will work. Either way, you can only try when you have a backup.\nYou may need to replace the mechanical drive -- ideally with a new, fast SSD -- or you can use an external SSD drive, which should still be faster.\n", "Q: Is a Boot Camp partition in Parallels Desktop still natively bootable?

When I disconnect, everything works again.\nIs there a know set of things (ports, port ranges, network broadcasts?) I could change or enable in VPN settings so that the 'Apple stuff' would still be routed to a local network at home? It seems that now everything gets routed into work VPN.\nThanks! I googled, but so far found only threads asking for help, with no solution.\n\nA: I just spent couple of hours trying to figure out how to solve this issue, and the solution was quite simple.\nThe problem with AnyConnect and cisco VPN is that it forces whole traffic to go through it, which includes local network (thus making other LAN hosts inaccessible). There seems to no to little config options in AnyConnect itself. Plus using USB seems to be working up until VPN connection is made.\nHowever, I found thanks to some forums that one can use openconnect to connect to PPTP VPN instead.\nbrew install openconnect\nand then\nsudo openconnect --user your_vpn_user --protocol=anyconnect vpn.server.com  establishes equivalent connection and doesn't interfere with LAN addresses! Plus it doesn't even need any cumbersome and slow GUI to do this. So it is a win win.\nP.S. I was close to turn my spare Raspberry Pi into a WiFi access point with VPN tunnel there and properly set up routing. Saved myself more problems.\n\nA: I was having the same issue whenever I connected my MacBook and iPhone via Mullvad VPN. I do not have VPN at router but on individual devices, so VPN broke my iCloud copy/paste and airdrop. It may be because they were not sharing same wifi network anymore, as in, they had two different data tunnels, and the only solution I found was to deploy VPN at router or turn off VPN.\nI dig Mullvad VPN Mac app preferences, and found that there is an option to enable \"Local network sharing\" that allows local network access to connected devices. I turned it on and voila, I had my airdrop back. I believe that major VPN providers' Mac app has this function, and if you toggle this function, you can get your problem solved.\n\n\nA: If you're using ExpressVPN and having the same issue with Sidecar etc., it can be fixed by turning off 'Network Protection', see this guide on ExpressVPN for more.\nThanks to ibk's answer for the idea.\n", "Q: How to stop multiple httpd instance in macOS Catalina I am not well experienced with macOS yet and need some help to understand why there are multiple instances of httpd running on my macOS Catalina 10.15.4\n\nQuestion:\nIf it is not required then how can I stop it all but the only one\nwhich I am using for the development?\nUpdated\nResult with App Processes - Hierarchically\n\nApache Location\nHere is my apache location\n➜  ~ which httpd\n/usr/local/bin/httpd\n\napache files path\n/usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf\n/usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n\n\nA: In the default config httpd starts a parent process usually owned by root which binds to port 80 (a port < 1024), opens log files and spawns child processes.

What causes this? System: macOS Catalina 10.15.2\nBackground: I've been a *nix user for many years. I use a remote Linux server where the root directory is used (i.e. there are folders where users can r/w such as /data and /analyses ), and I've used macOS in the same way until now. I got a new MacBook from my workplace this year. I administer the machine, so I am able to change anything that root can.\nIn the interest of continuing to use the file organization system on our remote server, I have disabled SIP and I'm mounting / with read/write on each boot (similarly to how it is done here). I can work in the /data and /analyses folders using the Terminal with no issues, but when it comes to using Finder, this is not the case. Creating and deleting folders and files is not possible with Finder. This is not the case with other GUI apps (for example, I'm able to use a text editor such as Sublime to edit plain text files in these folders, or create and save new ones into the directory of my choosing).\nIssue: When I use Finder to move or modify these files (for example, dragging a file to Trash) I get a warning message: \"file\" can't be modified or deleted because it's required by macOS. I can delete or modify these files with other apps, including Terminal, but for convenience sake I'd like some help finding a solution to this issue with Finder (for example, is there something I could change w/r/t Finder's permissions, or with the permissions set by macOS for the directories I'm working in).\nWhat I've already tried: changing the file and folder permissions/ownership with chmod and chown, with no effect on Finder's behavior\np.s. Unless you are certain it will directly help to solve this issue with Finder, thank you in advance for leaving out any lectures about why I should re-enable SIP, I've already heard them all. :)\n\nA: \nI use a remote Linux server where the root directory is used (i.e. there are folders where users can r/w such as /data and /analyses )... In the interest of continuing to use the file organization system on our remote server, I have disabled SIP and I'm mounting / with read/write on each boot \n\nThis is not a good strategy and should be avoided.\nThe first and most important thing to realize is that macOS ≠ Linux.  What Linux lets you \"get away with\" is not always a best practice for system administration.  When we reduce  everything down, what you're essentially asking is about placement of two folders and the root directory is actually not the best place for them, thus the issues you're running into.\nDisabling SIP, you remove one of the key protections that make macOS one of the safest operating systems on the market today.  Doing so to get around the security architecture so that you can create folders/mount volumes that reside in the root directory is counterproductive.  Instead of fighting against the OS, it's best to work with it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is /dev protected by SIP?\n\n*Other than user error, what types of attacks would SIP prevent?\n\n*How to repair macOS permissions after running “sudo chown -R _www /”? (A cautionary tale)\n\n\n\nUnless you are certain it will directly help to solve this issue with Finder...\n\nIt's not an issue with Finder.  SIP's been around a long time; since El Capitan (10.11) was released in 2015. This is not anything new.  However, the new APFS container structure of having two volumes, one writable and one not (with - Data appended to the volume name) is new.  While some of the security changes Apple has implemented causes more headaches than necessary, this isn't one of them.  \nThis is actually something that system admins should be doing - hardening the system and limiting what and where the user can write to by   \"containerizing\" (sandboxing) the directories/volumes with appropriate read/write/execute permissions.\nMount user accessible directories in the proper location\nAgain, the root directory is not really an appropriate place for shared data whether it be macOS or Linux.  Whether these directories are local to the Mac (the Mac is the network share), or you're mounting them from a remote file server, they should be placed in a protected volume like in /Users/Shared or mounted in /Volumes.  The reasoning behind this is that you can set the \"parent\" rights and apply it to all of the child folders whereas if you were to modify the rights of something in the root directory, you could potentially apply the wrong permissions across the whole system.    \nEven my Synology NAS (Linux based) doesn't allow me to create shares on the root folder.  It forces me to mount them in a sub volume with permissions I (with root access) cannot modify.  \nTL;DR\nYou're going against the current here; work with the OS and not against it.  If you're finding that you need to disable all of the protections that the system came with, you're likely not following an industry best practice.  Don't try to force macOS and Finder to behave a certain way because you can \"do it in Linux;\" follow it's lead and you'll have a secure, available, and most importantly a reliable system that your users can depend on.\n\nA: If you need to create directories off the root, the best option is to use firmlinks, which can be configured using /etc/synthetic.conf. From the manual page:\n...\nsynthetic.conf is intended to be used for creating mount points at / \n(e.g. for use as NFS mount points in enterprise deployments) and symbolic\nlinks (e.g. for creating a package manager root without modifying the\nsystem volume).  synthetic.conf is read by apfs.util(8) during early sys-\ntem boot.\n...\n\nIf you create /data and /analyses elsewhere and then have the links managed by synthetic.conf, you should be able to avoid disabling SIP and be able to access those directories from Finder.\n", "Q: Understanding the contents of com.apple.spaces.plist I'm interested in understanding the contents of com.apple.spaces.plist because I'm trying to develop a solution to the problem of restoring apps to their original Spaces after a restart.\nLooking at the value of the Space Properties property inside this plist, I see some information that looks relevant to the problem I'm trying to solve:\n    \"Space Properties\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"\",\n        \"windows\": [\n          8557,\n          114,\n          183,\n          91\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"40ED97C0-613E-4E9F-ADCB-B0E4A1788987\",\n        \"windows\": [\n          8557,\n          114,\n          188,\n          337,\n          338\n        ]\n      },\n      ...\n\nI assume the IDs under each windows property are the IDs of the applications in each Space.

Is that correct?\n\nThat appears to be correct. I confirmed this by saving copies of com.apple.spaces.plist over time and matching the changes in its contents to windows I moved back and forth across Spaces. There is a delay of a few seconds from when you move a window to when the plist is updated to reflect that change.\n\nCan I somehow, by editing this plist after a reboot, restore these window IDs to the Spaces they were assigned to before a reboot, and thus get all my windows back to where they were?\n\nThis doesn't seem to be possible. The plist appears to be a write-only source of information. That is, the OS periodically writes out what it's holding in memory to this file. But it doesn't update what's in memory by reading from this file.\nI tested this on macOS 10.15.4 by making edits to the plist. They were ignored by the OS and simply overwritten with the current state of my windows and Spaces.\n", "Q: Apple Developer Program: Individual vs Organization I already have an individual apple developer program enrollment but I'm thinking of turning one of my upcoming apps into a full standalone business.

It left my 500GB with one un-modifiable partition labeled \"Linux Swap\", and also a smaller Mac OSX Base System .\nCan I undo whatever I did, and just get back to normal OSX disk and boot stuff?  \n\nA: Your question is a bit sparse with respect to how you created the Ubuntu installer and the current state of your drive.\nMost users attempt to remove linux partitions using either the Disk Utility application or the diskutil command. Often this results in failure. \n\nActually the result may be 100% failure, but I can not know that because those who succeed are not apt to post a question here at Ask Different.\n\nAn alternative would be to boot to a Live version of Ubuntu and use an application or command to remove the linux partitions.

Is there a new solution to mount to read and write through Single User Mode?\n\nA: Catalina uses a new split-volume system for its file system, where system files are stored on a read-only volume, and user-modifiable parts of the filesystem are stored in a separate \"Data\" volume that's normally mounted read-write (see this article for more info). But in single-user mode they're both mounted read-only.\nIf you just need write access to the normally-writable parts of the filesystem, you just have to update the mount point for that volume:\nmount -uw /System/Volumes/Data\n\nIf you need write access to the normally-read-only volume, things are more complicated. You'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart in Recovery mode and then either make your modifications there and call it a day, or...\n\n*Open Terminal (under the Utilities menu in Recovery), run csrutil enable --without fs (see my answer here)\n\n*Restart in single-user mode\n\n*Run mount -uw / and maybe also mount -uw /System/Volumes/Data\n\n*Do your modifications\n\n*Finally, restart back to Recovery and run csrutil enable to get the normal system protections back.\n\n\nA: Yes, this is by design. Boot to recovery and choose terminal from the Utility menu. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\nHere is an example of when you use terminal app from recovery for things we used to use single user mode to accomplish. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207584\nOf course don’t follow all the steps above unless you want to erase a fusion drive equipped Mac, but it shows the steps to get to a command line environment on all OS that don’t work in single user mode. \n", "Q: Is the 30 inch apple cinema display supposed to feel hot to the touch after an hour? I recently bought a 30 inch cinema display and a OEM 150 watt power adapter and hooked it up to my MacPro 3,1.  Both the power supply and the display are very hot to the touch.  Is that normal ?\n\nA: The clue is in the wattage rating of the power supply: 150W. Yes, those displays do create a lot of heat. They are hot 'to the touch', so that the heat can dissipate through the exterior surfaces.\n", "Q: Freeware includes ssh terminal and file transfer support for Mac OS? \n*\n\n*I am looking for a freeware (like Bitvise SSH Client on Windows) that keeps track of servers/connections via a GUI and support some features: \n\n\n*\n\n*SSH terminal.\n\n*File transfer (FTP, SFTP, SCP ...).\n\n*Port forwarding .\n\n\n*In the absence of any freeware that meets the features in section 1.

In your situation, that means many smaller dedicated tools instead of one monolithic tool. Most of the features you want are part of built-in macOS tools. These tools are accessible by macOS's included Terminal.app.\n\n\n*\n\n*For Secure Shell connections, use ssh\n\n*For network file transfers, use scp or rsync\n\n*Port forwarding is typically part of your router's interface, not the local computer.\n\n", "Q: How to identify each of the fans inside my iMac 2010 First of all thanks for the great job you make here.

Note, the folder name is also the UUID assigned to the volume where the macOS operating system is stored. So, say you wanted to remove the recovery files for Catalina sorted in the volume labeled Snapper, then you would want to delete the folder named BD93DE8A-F1DF-43A1-BAB6-84EDC57F9177. The GUI way of doing this would be to use the Finder application. However, the /Volumes folder is hidden so you will need to press the key combination ⌘+shift+. to reveal this folder in the Finder application.\nI would not recommend removing the folder holding the recovery files for Catalina, unless you were going to remove the other folders and volumes created where Catalina was installed.\n\nA: It is normally not possible to use the GUI for this.

Both software returned no error message. \nI tried opening a bunch of files currently on the external HD (text, pdf, mp3,...) with different software. Same results.

I even tried a Windows PC with a third party software: the same story, the files just won't open regardless of the software I use.\nI finally tried with a data recovery software, but it only found deleted files, I couldn't \"recover\" files that weren't deleted.\nI could probably try and create an image of the disk, but it's 2TB and I don't have enough space, and anyway, will it work? \nDoes anybody have an idea of what is going on?\n\nA: Your files are corrupted.\nIf you can use macOS or Windows to open these files, you’ve reduced the points of failure that would have caused it.  You’re down to the USB enclosure or the drive itself.\nRecovery software won’t work because it looks for “orphaned” blocks of data. When you have a file, nothing is orphaned.  The software has no idea that the contents are a jumbled mess, it just knows the file is complete.\nFor now, test out your drive.  Write files to it.  Then disconnect it, reconnect it and try to read those files back.  If it fails, your enclosure and/or drive is failing.  \n", "Q: Locking my Macbook when I remove my smartcard I have a smartcard paired with my account on my 2015 Macbook.

Right now, I have to stay in in order for background operations to continue and that is not very usable.\n\nA: You need to open System Prefences > Energy Saver.

This determines the amount of the time the computer stays awake when idle (i.e. user not actively at the computer). \nIf you set the slider to \"Never\", it will let operations continue indefinitely (even though the display itself is blanked).

In macOS Catalina Apple has started requiring macOS apps to be notarized, otherwise users will be told \"macOS cannot verify this app is free from malware\" and prompted to move the app to the trash. The current workaround for this is that users have to right-click on the app and press \"Open,\" which is then followed by another warning about \"exposing your computer to malware\".\nTo avoid users having to worry about this, is it possible to notarize my app without a paid developer account, so users aren't prompted with the scary \"malware\" warning?\n\nA: Yes.

Im talking about the persons who take video of themselves, so quite close range.\n\nA: In Europe, every electronics product marketed to consumers must pass a battery of tests, one of them for the photobiological safety of any included light source according to IEC/EN 62471:2008, a slight revision of IEC 62471:2006. This is mandatory since September 2011, so almost any iPhone in existence must have qualified in order to be marketable.\nSince all major electronics manufacturers design their products for worldwide sales, Apple has to subject all iPhones to this standard. If any eye damage is to be expected, a warning label needs to be present (see below, source).\n\nIn the absence of such a warning, eye damage from exposure to the flashlight is extremely unlikely.\n\nA: According to WebMD, anywhere from 3 to 12 hours after exposure to ultraviolet light, you can begin to see symptoms of damage.\nThe damage is called a Corneal Flash Burn and is caused by overexposure to ultraviolet light from various sources including a photographer's flood lamp.\nHow long or how much light will cause damage?\nIt depends.  A few seconds of looking at a welding arc or direct sunlight can cause damage.  Looking at a bright LED may take a few minutes to a few hours depending on the brightness and intensity.\nYou aren't supposed to be staring into the light itself, it's supposed to light your subject. \n", "Q: Disk space available: Finder shows way less than System Information The Finder currently shows only 81GB available (at the bottom of a folder's window) whereas System Information > Storage shows 455GB available.\nWhy does the Finder show so much less space available?\nFYI: I'm running macOS 10.15.4 on an iMac with a 500GB drive.\n\nA: I suggest you run DaisyDisk which will do a graphical display of your disk contents.

Are there event logs? Over the past month or two the display on my old iMac 27-inch (\"late 2009\", running High Sierra 10.13.6) would randomly and suddenly go to sleep (sudden dead black) while in use (while typing, mousing, scrolling, etc.), but only about once a week or even less.\nThe first time I thought it had crashed (having the display go dead black while typing is very disconcerting) and I power-cycled it.  The second time I realized the system was still running, and I logged in remotely with SSH to find everything \"normal\".  I finally realized I could simply wake the display again with Control-Shift-Eject and then wiggling the cursor or hitting another key.\nThese past few days it started doing this very frequently -- every few minutes, or even more often for periods.\nAt first I thought it might be a software bug as it seemed to only happen when using the browser (perhaps a GPU bug).\nThen, because it seemed OK for a short while after being idle for an hour or more, I thought it might be something to do with overheating, and I played with fan speeds (to the great annoyance of my ears).  At first this seemed to make some difference, but I never really could make any strong correlation.\nBut then I realized it was probably being put to sleep under software control as apps were fully refreshing their windows upon waking the display (just as they do when returning from the screen saver, for example).\nFinally I tried changing the Energy Saver settings to \"Never\" let the display go to sleep.  This seems to have worked!\nNow I've also quieted the fans, and so far (an hour or two of constant use) I have not had the screen suddenly go black since.\nDoes anyone have any deep understanding of how exactly the system controls display sleep, and whether or not there's any way to see logging of the events controlling display sleep?\n\nA: You may have a Hot Corner checked. if your mouse touched a hot corner it will respond in a chosen way. One Hot Corner action is to put display to sleep. To check this go to System Preferences, Desktop & Screen Saver. Click on the Screen Saver tab and at the bottom of that pane is a button for Hot Corners. Click this and see if you hve a hot corner set up.\n\nA: So, there is logging, of a sort, and I think I can now confirm the random display sleep I've been observing is indeed due to a software bug.\nFirst off, the logging (and current status) of events and states related to system and display sleep can be found by running:\npmset -g assertionslog\n\nYesterday my screen stayed on for the rest of the day.  However on returning to my computer this morning I found the display off.  Pressing a key lit it up and the login window was there, as if I had not told it to keep the display on (but I still allowed it to lock the screen -- seems the screen saver still managed to turn off the display eventually).\nAbout five to ten minutes later the screen went black again while I was scrolling.  It continued to go black moments after being turned on again.\nAfter experimenting for a while to see if there was a recognizable pattern in the pmset output, I decided to try killing the processes that seemed to be changing state (i.e. with a plain SIGTERM).\nThe first one I tried was /usr/libexec/hidd, which was promptly restarted by launchd.  This made no difference to the screen going dark every few moments after being re-awoken.\nThe next one I tried was useractivityd.  This had immediate, positive, effect.  The screen has not gone black since.  Interestingly this process did not die -- it's still running and has been using CPU, but it is no longer being mentioned in any pmset output.\nThe ongoing saga...\nToday after an hour or so of normal use, the screen went black again, and again, and again, often only a second or so after waking it up.  Sending SIGTERM to useractivityd again didn't do much so I sent it a SIGKILL.  It was immediately restarted by launchd, but the battle to keep the display on continued.\nFinally things have settled down again, but I'm not sure what I did to make it so.\nThings get worse, then maybe better again\nYesterday I couldn't keep the display on for more than a few seconds, then managed to lock something up so the login screen wouldn't activate, and I ended up shutting the system down from an SSH session, powering off completely, and rebooting, only to have the problem begin again soon after.\nToday it was OK for a little while, then started blanking out again and being basically unusable.\nI was almost beginning to think it was a hardware problem.\nThen on a whim I disabled and uninstalled f.Lux.  Since then it went blank while unattended, then once more while in use, but otherwise has been much better than before.\nNOT a software problem:  Now the computer is basically unusable\nNow the computer is basically unusable (at least from the keyboard and screen).\nIf the machine is really cold then the screen will stay on for a few minutes, at most.  However if the machine is at \"normal\" operating temperature (according to all sensors and past history of all sensors), the screen may even blank out during the very early stages of booting (i.e. while the console boot messages are still scrolling during a verbose boot).\nThe interesting part is that the screen can be turned on by the OS (i.e. by pressing  and then generating \"activity\" with keypresses or wiggling the mouse cursor, etc.), only to be turned off again moments or seconds later by whatever hardware and/or firmware that is failing.\nIf I can figure out how to programatically turn on the screen (e.g. by generating the same keyboard events that I use manually), then I may be able to continually re-light the screen with a daemon to make it possible to limp along until I'm able to replace the whole machine.\nA Reprieve, of sorts....\nSo just after making the last edit I stumbled upon an article by someone describing this same problem.  After the usual amount of entirely useless mis-directed pontification about the possible causes of the problem (all entirely impossible) and the regular raft of pointless suggested actions, there was a tiny hint that turning down the brightness might help.\nI hadn't thought of that earlier because I had no luck improving the situation by running all the fans at full blast.\nHowever I dropped the brightness to the minimum and left the screen activated all night -- and what do you know!  It had not gone blank by the next morning!\nI have now been using the machine, albeit with some eye strain, for a few days, including today with the room temperature climbing slightly (despite air conditioning -- it's 43C outside), with no blanking of the screen.  I'm able to run the brightness at 5 bars shown on the on-screen control, or 0.33 with https://github.com/nriley/brightness\n", "Q: Laravel new [project] not working despite PHP, Composer, everything working I'm trying to install laravel, but keep getting the \"The Zip PHP extension is not installed.

The error message I get is No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key.\nWhat I did so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried to create a boot medium using Boot Camp assistant. This failed, because on the ISO-Image I have there is a file install.wim, which is too large for a FAT32-formatted drive.\n\n*Tried to manually create the boot medium, using the above ISO-image, formatting the drive using ExFAT. This resulted in the above error message. I did some research and it seems that ExFAT is not bootable?\n\n\nThe most promising attempt was the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*So, since I have another device running Windows 10 available, I ended up installing Microsoft's MediaCreationTool and creating a FAT32-based bootable USB drive.\n\n*Using this drive; I was once able to boot into the Windows 10 Installation. Since I was not able to quickly obtain a product key and thought I needed one for the installation, I canceled the installation at this point.\n\n*After cancelling the installation, the Windows partition stopped showing up as a startup disk!\n\n*I restarted the Boot Camp procedure, erasing- and re-creating the Bootcamp-partition.\n\n*The USB drive stopped being recognised; I again get the above error message No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key. In macOS the USB drive shows up without any problem.\n\n\nI did a few more attempts (each time erasing and creating the bootcamp partition; trying to create another USB tool), but always with the same result.\nAny help in getting this to run is appreciated. If possible, I'd like to avoid updating to mac OS Catalina.\n\nA: The Boot Camp Assistant works under very strict conditions. Failure occurs when any one of the conditions is ignored. In your case, the condition was using Sierra. Apple expects you to install the latest version of macOS available for your model Mac.\nThe firmware needed to allow booting from ExFAT formatted media is installed when upgrading to High Sierra. Since you are using Sierra, your Mac probably has not had this firmware upgrade. The default Windows 10 ISO file, downloaded from Microsoft when running macOS, contains the file install.wim, which is to large to store in a FAT32 formatted volume. However, the Windows 10 ISO or USB flash drive, created using the media creation tool, substitutes a install.esd file for the install.wim file. Basically, .esd files use a better compression algorithm than .wim files. The result is the install.esd file can be stored on FAT32 formatted volumes. You could use a ExFAT (or maybe FAT32) formatted flash drive to transfer the Windows 10 ISO, created using the media create tool, from machine running Windows to your Mac running Sierra.\n\nNote: I do not know, if the install.wim file contains the same data as the install.esd file. There may very well be extra files in the install.wim version that Macs need that does not exist in the install.esd version.\n\nYour model Mac is designed to BIOS boot Windows 7 and UEFI boot Windows 10. When BIOS booting Windows, the installation drive needs to be hybrid partitioned. The Boot Camp Assistant automatically determines, if hybrid partitioning is needed for a Windows installation by inspecting the Windows USB flash drive. Of course, the assumption is the files on the flash drive were created by the Boot Camp Assistant. From the way you worded your question, apparently the only files on the flash drive were put there by the Microsoft media creation tool.\nThe GUI Windows installer will only install for BIOS booting when the installation drive is hybrid partitioned, otherwise Windows will be installed for UEFI booting. Your model Mac should install Windows 10 to UEFI boot, primarily because the Windows Support Software is designed for a UEFI booting Windows 10.\n\nNote: The message No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key is a indication the firmware is trying to BIOS boot the Windows installation media. The media should be UEFI booting.\n\nOptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try using the ISO file which can be created using the media create tool.\n\n*Upgrade to a newer version of macOS.\n\n*Install Windows using the macOS and Windows CLI. This option requires many steps which were omitted from this answer.\n\n\nA: Самая сложная ситуация, когда \"советчики\" дают не правильные советы! Windows 10 нельзя загружать в MacBook в режиме UEFI потому, что тогда после установки Windows - не будут работать звуковая и видео карты. Проблема заключается в том, что EFI, который в Macbook не имеет правильных настроек и эти настройки подхватывает сама OSX, когда уже загружена. OSX берет на себя решение этой проблемы. Но Windows так не умеет делать и по этому когда она запустится - она прочитает параметры из EFI Macbook (а там для Windows они не правильные и по этому Windows не корректно видит устройства). Главная задача для правильной работы Windows - это работа именно в Legasy режиме! Только в этом режиме она будет работать правильно. Подумайте сами. Если устанавливать Windows в EFI режиме, то тогда зачем создавать раздел в MBR формате? Ведь тогда вообще ничего делать не нужно - достаточно дисковой утилитой просто создать новый раздел, который продолжает быть в системе GPT, а потом просто запустить установку Windows в EFI режиме и все! И Windows работала бы и никакого раздела Bootcamp не нужно! НО!!! Для того, что бы Windows работала - обязательное условие работы это только режим Legaсy, который достигается только установкой на MBR раздел. Только по этой причине столько нужно сделать всего, что бы создался специальный раздел в MBR (для Windows). Когда же BootCamp перезагружает компьютер - он временно переключает его в режим загрузки Legacy и тогда Windows должна запуститься в этом режиме и конечно установиться на созданный для нее раздел MBR. В моем случае я пока что не могу запустить установку Windows в этом \"старом\" режиме.получаю ошибку загрузочного устройства. Попробую все таки USB2 флешку, а не USB3. Может быть поможет... Был бы DVD привод - было бы намного проще!  \n", "Q: Intel 2019 Macbook Pro 16 Inch Overheating I just got my 2019 macbook pro 16 inch yesterday, upgrading from a 2016 macbook. I am slightly worried at the battery life thus far. This morning for example, I have been browsing the web to check email and read websites- nothing too intensive and no streaming video or anything even approaching that. However, the battery has dropped over 20% in an hour from doing this, with the fans on pretty loud at times. I also had other apps open in the background, including Xcode, but with nothing actively running- xcode was simply open on a project but nothing was built etc.\nI have the i9 version, so I expected that the processor will run a bit hotter than my previous laptop. But the battery life seems abnormally bad... Can anyone advise me if this is normal/any quick fixes for it?\nThis is the output from Activity Monitor:\n\niCloud is uploading some files right now, but the process 'bird' in particular is taking up a lot of CPU all the time.\n\nA: I also have the mbp i9 and sometimes when I move large amounts of files around (500,000+ files) it makes the fans on my macbook pro go into overdrive (sometimes for hours).\nI think this might be happening to you because of the mds, mds_stores and mdworker_shared processes I see in your screenshot.\nThere is no solution really. You have to let this thing run and finish indexing. It might take a while but here are two recommendations:\n\n*\n\n*It's possible to turn off indexing if you need to get something done and indexing is interfering and then let it run at a later time. I'll give the commands to do this below.\n\n\n*I don't know your physical setup but if your mac is indexing and running hot for hours like mine sometimes does, I open up the notebook so that the mac's lcd screen can run a bit cooler and take a break from the heat. Just an opinion that keeping your mac closed while its running super hot for long periods might not be so good for your lcd color uniformity longevity.\nHere are the commands to turn indexing on and off. These work for me and I'm running MacOS 11.2.1 Just remember to turn it back on or spotlight wont be able to find new apps and files that you add.\nTurn off the indexing:\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\n\nTurn the indexing back on:\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\nGood luck and enjoy your new mbp!! :)\n\nA: Unfortunately, the fault t is a bad design concerning the heat dissipation of the laptop. Especially if you use the display with an external monitor it gets very noisy and hot. Maybe they can solve it with a software update by reducing the voltage of the cpu and gpu. Please report this problem to Apple. If you look on google there is really a lot of people complaining about it.\n(Tip: you should charge your laptop on the right side).\n", "Q: How can I save my carefully constructed printer presets before I have to re-install my printer? My Brother MFC-L5750DW is refusing to print documents (worked fine this morning), and after restarting, checking for latest software and drivers (currently updating) I suspect it's time to remove and re-add the printer via SysPrefs.\nOver the last few months I have carefully saved up numerous printing presets which AFAIK will all be lost when I remove the printer.\nI don't want that - what steps can I do to keep these presets - is there a .pref file somewhere?\nAnything else I should do first?\nOS 10.15.4\nMac Mini (Late 2012)\nPrinter Driver (and Firmware) updating as we speak (released yesterday)…\nThanks!\n\nA: Your custom presets are located in\n${HOME}/Library/Preferences/com.apple.print.custompresets.plists\n\nNow, it is possible that it may have the printer name \"embedded\" in the filename.

Now that I've upgraded to Catalina and I am using the new ZSH shell, I've noticed that ~/.bash_profile has been replaced with ~/.zprofile and since installing iTerm2 shell integration, it added a ~/.zshrc file.\nLooking at the ZSH documentation on Startup/Shutdown Files, there are a number of files (located in the home directory $HOME or ~/):\n\n\n*\n\n*.zprofile (login shell)\n\n*.zshenv (environment variables)\n\n*.zshrc (interactive shell)\n\n*.zlogin (login shell)\n\n*.zlogout (when the shell exits)\n\n\nWhat is also confusing is that ~/.zprofile and ~/.zlogin are both for login shells, so, things can get confusing as to what to put where.\nWhat startup/shutdown files should be used when setting up the ZSH shell environment and how/what should they be configured?\n\nA: This is an attempt to write a canonical QA for this issue, as per the Meta post:  Where is the list of canonical questions stored for Ask Different? I expect it to be periodically edited with the goal of becoming a comprehensive information resource.\nWhat should be used in ZSH on a Mac\nI posted a more narrowly scoped question on Unix & Linux and got some clarification on how these files \"work.\"  Here's the summary of that answer and what I've learned in my research as to what, in my opinion should be used in a ZSH environment on a Mac.\n\n*\n\n*.zprofile\n.zlogin and .zprofile are basically the same thing - they set the environment for login shells1; they just get loaded at different times (see below).  .zprofile is based on the Bash's .bash_profile while .zlogin is a derivative of CSH's .login.  Since Bash was the default shell for everything up to Mojave, stick with .zprofile.\n\n\n*.zshrc\nThis sets the environment for interactive shells2.  This gets loaded after .zprofile.  It's typically a place where you \"set it and forget it\" type of parameters like $PATH, $PROMPT, aliases, and functions you would like to have in both login and interactive shells.\n\n\n*.zshenv (Optional)\nThis is read first and read every time.  This is where you set environment variables.  I say this is optional because is geared more toward advanced users where having your $PATH, $PAGER, or $EDITOR variables may be important for things like scripts that get called by launchd.  Those run under a non-interactive shell 3 so anything in .zprofile or .zshrc won't get loaded.  Personally, I don't use this one because I set the PATH variable in my script itself to ensure portability.\n\n\n*.zlogout (Optional)\nBut very useful!  This is read when you log out of a session and is very good for cleaning things up when you leave (like resetting the Terminal Window Title)\nFor an excellent, in-depth explanation of what these files do, see What should/shouldn't go in .zshenv, .zshrc, .zlogin, .zprofile, on Unix/Linux.\n\nSome Caveats\nApple does things a little differently so it's best to be aware of this.  Specifically,  Terminal initially opens both a login and interactive shell even though you don't authenticate (enter login credentials).  However, any subsequent shells that are opened are only interactive.\nYou can test this out by putting an alias or setting a variable in .zprofile, then opening Terminal and seeing if that variable/alias exists.  Then open another shell (type zsh); that variable won't be accessible anymore.\nSSH sessions are login and interactive so they'll behave just like your initial Terminal session and read both .zprofile and .zshrc\nOrder of Operations\nThis is the order in which these files get read.  Keep in mind that it reads first from the system-wide file (i.e. /etc/zshenv) then from the file in your home directory (~/.zshenv) as it goes through the following order.\n.zshenv → .zprofile → .zshrc → .zlogin → .zlogout\n\n1 A login shell is simply a shell, whether local or remote, that allows a user to authenticate to the system.  These shells are typically interactive shells.\n2 In interactive mode, they [the shell] accept input typed from the keyboard.  (GNU Bash Reference Manual, 1.2 What is a Shell?)\n3 When executing non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.

Honestly if Google would just add a two-stroke \"insert row\" hotkey, that would relieve me of this whole idiotic exercise :)\n\nA: It is working fine here.\nHowever in my experience most problems using UI sequences are related to the lack of delay for the system to execute the thread. Often it will process the strokes so fast that the actions are not yet finished before automator sends another command, causing overlays and hence ignoring the last action. A simple solution is providing tiny delays between each stroke. \nAlso the return input line can be causing issues, because the input is empty and there is no parameters.\nI have tested this script successfully:\non run\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\n    delay 0.1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 34 using {control down, option down}\n        delay 0.1\n        key code 15\n    end tell\nend run\n\n", "Q: Having text message notifications on my iphone (and apple watch), despite receiving notifications on macbook I have enabled receiving text messages from my iphone in Messages.app on my macbook.

(The latest Google Chrome is already at version 80). The reason Chrome won't give me the latest update is because my OS is not supported anymore. So obviously I now want to install the latest OS X.\nUnfortunately, when I go to:  Apple > Software Update the App Store opens to the Updates tab and is empty, saying \"No Updates Available\".\nEven if I do a search in the app store, I can't find any of the new OS X versions.\nHow do I find and update to the latest OS X?\n\nA: The new macOS is not displaying because you are not signed into the App Store with your AppleID.\nSince you are in the category of \"OS X 10.10 Yosemite or earlier\" (10.9 is before 10.10), you might have some trouble signing in because your OS does not support two-factor authentication.\nUse two step verification:\nWhen you open the App Store and try to sign in, you may see some text in red saying \"Please type your password followed by the security code\".\nCheck your phone. Your phone may ask if you allow the login from a certain device; click \"allow\". It will then show you a pin number.\nSo if your password is \"hushpuppies\" and the pin on your phone is \"123456\", type \"hushpuppies123456\" in the password field.\nAfter you have signed in, you still might not see anything in the \"updates\" tab. Try looking at the \"featured\" tab to see if the OS is there. Once you find it, (in my case, there was a banner in the featured tab for \"Catalina\") click the \"get\" button and the download will start.\nRun the downloaded installer and follow instructions.\n", "Q: Copy files of specific type from parent to child folder I can successfully copy the file from the folder \"objects\" (the directory I'm in) to it's subfolder \"access\" with this code in Terminal. \nfind . -name *.pdf -exec cp {} ./access \\;\n\nBut the code is also looking into the \"access folder\" for files to copy and I get this message\ncp: ./access/cuid12368.pdf and ./access/cuid12368.pdf are identical (not copied).\n\nIs there a way to not have it look into the \"access\" folder for files to copy?\n\nA: The find command is not necessary for this operation. Use:\ncp *.pdf access/.\n\nThis copies all PDF files to the access subfolder and is much prettier and simpler than the equivalent find command.\n\nA: You can copy files from a folder into a subfolder by simply using the cp command.  For example I have a directory folder1 with 10 PDF files and a folder named folder2. Copy or move the PDF files into folder2 by the following.\ncd folder1\nmv *.pdf folder2/\n\nThis will move the pdf files to the subfolder folder2.\n\nA: If you insist on using the find ... -exec cp ...\\; (instead of the cp) command and don't want it to walk any subdirectory use the -maxdepth X argument. \n\n... 0 limits the whole search to the command line arguments (=does nothing).\n  ... 1 limits the whole search to the start directory itself (=no sub-directories).\n\nfind . -name *.pdf -maxdepth 1 -exec cp {} ./access \\;\n\nIn 10.11 El Capitan the previous command failed (find: example01.pdf: unknown primary or operator) and I had to use:\nfind . -name \"*.pdf\" -maxdepth 1 -exec cp {} ./access \\;\n\n\nA: \nIs there a way to not have it look into the \"access\" folder for files to copy?\n\n\nUse the -path \"pathname\" arguments.\nfind . -name *.pdf -path \"./access\" -exec cp {} ./access \\;\n\n", "Q: Rsync keeps copying the same file I have used rsync for many years between linux filesystems without any problem with a very deterministic behavior. Now I try to use it on mac and experience some problem that some files (a small proportion of my 600000 files) gets copied over and over.\nHere is what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Moving from MacOS rsync 2.6.9 to rsync 3.1.3 (from brew) did not solve the problem.\n\n*Giving some large time interval in order to avoid possible clock skew did not resolve the problem.\n\n*I saw in some other answers that a possible problem is the utf-8 vs utf-8-mac characters. I understand that it can be a problem but I am ready to accept ascii filenames for the purpose of having linux and mac coexisting. The files in question have ASCII file names.\nThe weird think about it is that this unexpected behavior is completely deterministic. The same file ListDebug/ForDEBUG gets copied over and over. Yet the file ListDebug/ForDEBUG2 which is next to it was not copied over and over.\nAny indication on the origin of this strange behavior would be much welcomed.\nEDIT: I found some more info when copying only the directory ListDebug.\nWhen I run rsync -vadi -e ssh remote:ListDebug . I get\nmathieu@MacBook-Pro: rsync -vadi -e ssh remote:ListDebug .\n>f.st......... ListDebug/ForDebug\nmathieu@MacBook-Pro: rsync -vadi -e ssh remote:ListDebug .\n>f.st.........

On the other hand if I rename the files ForDebug/ForDEBUG to file1/file2 then the bug disappear. Ve\n\nA: To summarize the comments: rsync does not handle the transfer of files between a case-sensitive filesystem (typically used on Unix/Linux), and a case-insensitive filesystem (typically used by Windows and MacOS).\nWhen 2 different source paths (eg d/x and d/X) are the same after notional conversion to, say, lowercase, then rsync does not notice, and may transfer d/x, then overwrite the same destination file with d/X. \nIf the files do not contain the same data, and have the same timestamp, the files will always be updated on future rsync runs.\nThere does not seem to be any solution proposed by rsync. One can identify potential problems by going through the source files to list the ambiguities:\nfind . | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | LC_ALL=C sort | LC_ALL=C uniq -d\n\nAlternatively, a case-sensitive destination can be created.\n", "Q: stuck with name and new and enter password prompt I reinstalled Catalina and everything works just fine with installation. but I am stuck at here and the setup assistant doesn't show up after the installation. \nI tried I Cloud account and I tried also the old user password\n \n\nA: This is completely normal. This is a macOS setting that some users prefer because it might provide more security. Do you remember the Username of your user when you were on Mojave (Or High Sierra)? If so, that is your username in the \"Name\" field. Password is the password to that user.\nIf you don't remember your creds:\nIf you don't remember your login information, you can try using macOS Recovery to find out. First, boot macOS Recovery by restarting and pressing Command + R. Next, access the Terminal. If you had your disk encrypted, then first, you would need to type diskutil unlockVolume diskID and type the password of the disk. Then, type diskutil mount diskID. Then, you can do cd /Volumes/VolName/Users and ls. This will show you all users on the Mac.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/324521/371580\nThis helped me alot.\nIf you resintalled on existed Mac OS most probably setup assistant will not show up.

To speed it up, I bought  two Kingston PC3L-12800 1600 MHz memory modules which have 4 GB each. However, my computer keeps showing the famous \"beach ball\" if try to do to many things at the same time (keeping multiple tabs open, closing applications one after another etc).\nDo you think there is a compatibility issue? If so, is there a way that I can solve it? \n\nA: Yes, there's a problem:\nPC3L ≠ PC3.\nPC3L is PC3 Low Voltage memory that operates at 1.35V and PC3 operates at 1.5V.  The 2012 MacBook Pro calls for PC3-12800.  See Everymac.com.  For best results you want to use the exact memory, or higher quality memory that operates at both voltage levels.\nAlso, that Mac is capable of 16GB of RAM, and the price point is low enough that you could max it out for only a marginal amount more.

I have a weird issue with drag and drop in Finder. When I drag a file/folder into a new folder to move it there, it does not let me hold down the mouse and navigate through the subfolders. I can drag and drop \"one folder deep\", but Finder does not open the folder that I drag on top of.\nFor example:\n\nIn this case, I could drag the \"Database\" folder into the \"System Admin\" folder\" (Whoops that name lol) but not into the \"Linux\" subfolder inside \"System Admin\". Finder will only let me drag \"Database\" one folder deep. It will not open the \"System Admin\" folder and show me the subfolders where I could then drag on into \"Linux\".\nI'm not exactly sure long this has been like this, since I usually use other methods than drag and drop to get stuff done, but I think that it has been like this since I upgraded from High Sierra to Mojave.\nI am using the Magic Mouse 2 if that helps. I have been using it ever since I got this Mac though, back when drag and drop still worked fully. And if I use other mice the problem is still there.\nAny help is welcome!\n\nA: So what worked for me was to turn on Spring-loading delay in System Preferences > Accessibility > Pointer Control.\n\nI have no idea why it would not work without this, but it works fine now.

These allow a command to be issued before the prompt is displayed.\nI also wouldn't recommend a long prompt anyway as it makes usability very difficult when entering commands. Putting the full directory above your prompt is much better from a UI standpoint.  The following code accomplishes that. \nSimply put the following in your ~/.zprofile.\nprecmd ()  { printf \"\\n\"; pwd | awk -F \"/\" ' {for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) printf \"\\033[01;34m\"$i\"\\033[38;5;206m/\"; printf\"\\n\" }' }\n\nAnd here are the results:\n\nThe above screenshot is my iTerm window showing that I have traversed deep into my /Applications/Firefox.app directory with the current directory formatted in blue separated by pink forward slashes.\n\nHow it Works...\nI've expanded the one line premcmd function above so that it's multi-line and added in some variables so we can better see what's going on.\nprecmd() {\nprintf \"\\n\";\npwd | awk -F \"/\" '{ blue=\"\\033[01;34m\"; \\\n                    pink=\"\\033[38;5;206m\"; \\\n                    for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) \\\n                      printf blue $i pink \"/\"; \\\n                      printf \"\\n\"\n                   }'\n} \n\nHere's what it all means:\n\n\n*\n\n*printf \"\\n\" prints out a new line char.  This is for aesthetics.\n\n*pwd returns the working directory name (man pwd) which is then piped (\"|\") to the next command, awk (man awk).\n\n*-F \"/\" defines the field separator to the forward slash; awk's default is a space.  I kept my prompt to it's short and succinct setup.\n\n\nWithin the awk \"program,\" delimited by the braces (\"{\" and \"}\") we have the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*variables blue and pink are set to their ANSI escape codes \\033[01;34m and \\033[38;5;206m respectively.   \n\n*We then have a for/do loop that iterates through each of the fields that awk has processed.

The man page of ifconfig says GNU inetutils 1.9.3-dirty at the end.\nHow do I get back the original one?\n\nA: You probably installed inetutils 1.9.3 with a package manager like brew or MacPorts.\nBesides GNU versions of various tools (telnet, rsh etc.) it also installs a GNU version of ifconfig.\nTo distinguish the GNU tools from macOS tools with the same names they are usually linked from the install dir (installed with brew this is: /usr/local/opt/inetutils/gnubin) to a directory in the standard PATH prefixed with a g (e.g. ifconfig > gifconfig or ftp > gftp).\nIf you add this install dir to your PATH variable in a way that gives preference over the standard paths, the GNU tools will be executed instead of the original ones.\n\nCheck your PATH variable: echo $PATH. You will likely see something like:\n/usr/local/opt/inetutils/gnubin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:...\n\nNow edit the file which determines your PATH variable (probably either ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile) and remove the gnubin path. \nExample: nano ./bash_profile\n...\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/inetutils/gnubin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH\"\n...\n\nChange this to:\n...\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH\"\n...\n\nThen close the Terminal window or relaunch Terminal.app. This will \"reenable\" the standard versions of the commands. The GNU tools are still available by entering a command prefixed with a g (e.g. gifconfig or gftp).\n\nA: The which command will show what path a command is running:\nme@dev ~ % which ifconfig\n/sbin/ifconfig\n\nSo, you see on my dev machine, the standard path to the program.

In the comments, I mentioned that I wasn't amenable to putting a function within a prompt for security reasons.\nOk...disclaimers are out of the way.\n\nMy first observation is that you have a newline character being generated by awk.\n\nSo, in your prompt, you're telling it to output a new line in something that's supposed to be contained to a single line.  I don't now how PROMPT handles things within ZSH, but I doubt it handles new line chars very well.\nSecondly, you seem to be mixing up all the different things that ZSH, awk, and functions in general have to deal with.  I'm still a bit foggy as to the actual logic here, but it seems like you're trying to push \"normal\" escape codes through two layers of functions within ZSH by using their color conventions and ZSH's loadable modules.  \n\nCould anyone take a look please at the 2 links that I gave above, it could contain the solution in my case?\n\nWhy?  What in those links lead you to believe that?  The first link is about variable expansion within the prompt.  The second show you how to colorize your prompt using both escape sequences and the preferred braces method in ZSH.\nI believe the issue is the over-complexity.\nYou're shoehorning a function that not only has the ANSI escape codes, which are supported, but calling another function that creates a pipe, which means it creates a sub shell to call yet another function!  (This is what I was referring to re:  layers and complexity).  \nThis is why I suggested using precmd().  Not only can you nest functions, but you can call multiple functions and then generate your prompt.  I advise you to explore that more and not fixate on PROMPT being the sole method to skin this cat.\nMy other piece of advice is to articulate what you'd ultimately like to accomplish and post that as a new question because there's probably a solution you're not aware of.  IMO, this sounds like an XY Problem\n\nA: SOLUTION FINALLY FOUND : my perseverance has paid off, everyting is working fine, no more shifting and colorized forward slash in PATH, with :\n# Prompt for zsh : path separated by %F{13} slash to better see where we are\nsetopt PROMPT_SUBST\n\n# Path with colorized forward slash\nslash_color() {\ndirs | awk -F \"/\" '{ blue=\"%{\\033[38;5;75m%}\"; \\\n                     pink=\"%{\\033[38;5;206m%}\"; \\\n                     for (i=1; i<NF; i++) \\\n                      printf blue $i pink \"/\"; \\\n                     printf blue $NF pink; \\\n                   }';\n}\n\n# Prompt final\nPROMPT=$'%F{13}|%F{green}%n@%F{cyan}%m%F{13}|%f%T%F{13}|$(slash_color)%F{13}|%F{7} '\n\n# Zsh reverse auto-completion\nbindkey '^[[Z' reverse-menu-complete\n\nThanks a lot for all your advices.\n", "Q: How to undelete files removed with rm -rf on an APFS SSD disk? Is there any way to restore files removed with rm -rf on an APFS formatted SSD?\n\nA: No. It's very unlikely you're going to recover anything.\nThe reason being is that when you delete something from an SSD, the way it's deleted makes it virtually impossible to recover.  Basically, when you delete something, it tells the drive to mark the sectors as deleted just like in a traditional hard drive.  However, when subsequently asked to read back the data, the drive will respond back with either zeros or garbage.\n\n*\n\n*How to get the \"securely erase\" function of Disk Utility on El Capitan & Sierra\n\n*Can the data on an MacBook Pro SSD be recovered after formatting using Disk Utility\nNote:  It's not impossible that you’re unable to recover any data; you will need to send it to a lab or to the manufacturer who can get around the mechanisms that secures the data.  However, this is usually very cost prohibitive unless it's for forensics and provided that the sector hasn't been overwritten already.  Unlike magnetic media, it only takes a single write to send the preexisting data into oblivion.\n\nA: There is no way to easily recover the files deleted by rm. You will ned a 3rd part app to do so. There is an app called Stellar, EaseUS, or Disk Drill.

The top option will be to Export x items where x is the number of png files you selected. Select that option and a new pane appears where you can set the type as jpeg.

The CPU can never actually stop. At best, the CPU can go into a continuous loop, but this still requires the use of electricity. This use of electricity produces heat. \nIdle means the operating system is waiting for something to do. In this case, the CPU may be use less electricity, but the electricity usage does not go to zero.

How should one physically modify the hardware connection inside the hardware in order to make the analog hardware switch, already in place for switching from ring to silent and vice versa, could also switch on and off (by physical disconnection) the cameras, microphones and GPS radio? \nIt would be a huge security enhancement for the iPhone!\nIs it possible and has anyone ever done it?\n\nA: \nIs it possible and has anyone ever done it?\n\nTechnically, it's possible.  The better question and resulting answer would be:  \"Is it feasible.\"  That would be a definitive no.\nThe switch isn't directly connected to to the speaker circuitry. It's connected to a chip that's \"watches\" for input on some particular pins to go high (positive voltage detected) or low (no/negative voltage). The firmware detects this and \"interfaces\" with the software (iOS) to do something like disable the speakers.  \nSo, could the software do something else like turn it into Airplane mode?  Sure.  You'd have to jailbreak the phone to do so. \n\n...could also switch on and off (by physical disconnection) the cameras, microphones and GPS radio\n\nAgain yes, but it's not entirely feasible.  This would be more difficult because you'd have to \"create\" the electrical pathways (traces) by which the main chip could tell another chip or a relay or whatever to engage a transistor (an electrical switch) to (dis)connect the connection to the peripheral.   Plus, you'd have to modify the software as described above.\nHas anyone done it?\nMy cursory search of the Internet says no. Possibly because of the obstacles involved.  If someone has done it, it's likely in a \"bodged\" together state not ready for general consumption.\n\nIt would be a huge security enhancement for the iPhone!\n\nYou're probably right.

It says it's your computer that's lacking space, but, if you check Settings >> General >> iPhone (or iPad) Storage and it's almost full, it could be your iOS device.\nJust had it happen again... I followed the accepted answer, still no love, even tried installing iTunes as admin and running it as admin by right clicking and saying, well, run as admin, no dice.

I get the \"not enough free space on your computer\" error complete with unhelpful \"emptying the Recycle Bin\" message.\nVaguely recalled this happening before, deleted a few gigs of stuff from the iPad, and now all is happy. I just completed an encrypted local backup.\nAgain, the error said my computer didn't have enough hard drive space & said to empty the recycle bin, etc. But it was, indeed, the iOS device that needed free space for the backup to execute.\n\nA: Check the cable\nI had the same issue, trying to back up an iphone 6s, which was almost full (32GB). First tried cleaning up my mac, no luck.\nThen moving the location where the backup would be made to another bigger drive. Although that process worked, I got the same error.\nSo next, I tried to create the backup on another mac, brandnew M1 pro. Same error, then on a PC. Same error.\nThen I tried a different cable. Instead of the (perfectly fine, for all other purposes but backing up) offical Apple usb-lighting cable, I uses a usb-lighting cable, and plugged the usb-c directly into my M1 Macbook Pro (not using a usb hub).\nAnd then everything worked smoothly.\nHope this experience might help some people.\n", "Q: Mac startup sound keeps coming back to haunt me Seriously though, even after applying the terminal command (below) that sound will be back after x numbers of shutdowns or restarts: \nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%80\n\nI'd appreciate a truly permanent answer to silencing that startup sound.\n\nA: You could try using a free application called Deeper by Titanium Software.

I have an 2010 iMac running High Sierra. My computer has been very slow lately and does a lot of beachballing. I've run Disk Utility on my internal drive and it returns that volume appears to be ok. I've read that TechTool Pro fixes a lot of disk-related issues. Does TechTool do anything that Disk Utility/First Aid doesn't? Etrecheck indicates I may have a disk drive problem. Will TechTool help me determine what is wrong?\n\nA: As far as the main question (in your title), yes, TechTool Pro does a lot more than Disk Utility does. \nIn fact, in many ways they're not really comparable products. It's somewhat akin to comparing a butter knife to a Swiss army knife. That is, Disk Utility performs a number of disk-related tasks, whereas TechTool Pro performs all these and a lot of other types of tasks as well.\nAs for whether TechTool Pro will help you determine what is wrong with your Mac, the best guess anyone here is going to give you is \"Maybe.\"\nTechTool Pro is generally an excellent product (it hasn't had a 'perfect' history, but overall it's been quite positive). In fact, Apple even used to provide a cut down version of it to users who paid extra for AppleCare coverage. But only you can decide whether the cost of it is worth it for you or not, especially if you're planning on upgrading in the near future.\nAs an aside, in a 2010 iMac you may be better off just replacing the hard drive, especially if it still has its original drive in it.\nFrom memory, if it's a 21\" model it wouldn't have had the option of an SSD, so the money you'd spend on TTP may be much better spent on an SSD. It'll give new life to your iMac and you could then put it to other uses after upgrading to your new Mac. And when the iMac eventually dies due to other reasons, you could resurrect the SSD and use it as an external drive. Just another option for consideration. \n", "Q: The system version of Tk is deprecated I installed python3 and tcl-tk with homebrew on my iMac.

I wanted to know if it's possible to install Manjaro on an SSD and then swap the old Mac drive with the Manjaro SSD? I've tried using Rufus to make a bootable SSD and when I installed it in the Mac, all I get is a blank gray screen. I was hoping to get to an install screen but no luck. What am I doing wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Rufus to use to make a bootable USB flash drive. In your case, you are suppose to boot from the flash drive to software that can install Manjaro on another drive. Usually, this is the the computers internal drive.\nWhat you propose to do has the following flaws.\n\n\n*\n\n*You want Rufus to put the software on the SSD drive you intend to install internal in the computer, instead of a USB flash drive. \n\n*You have not drive to install Manjaro on to. In other words, if you did get the SSD to boot from the Manjaro installation software put there by Rufus, then this software could not install to the internal drive because that is where the Manjaro installation software resides.\n\n\nAdditionally, the standard RAM that came with this model Mac was 512 MB. To install Manjaro, you need at least 1 GB of RAM. If you do not have enough RAM memory, then you can upgrade. I would recommend 2 GB of RAM. One such source is OWC.\nYou can not install any 64 bit version of Manjaro, because the processor in your Mac mini is 32 bit.

My problem is that every few minutes, /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework/Versions/A/Support/mds_stores starts up, and keeps going until my hard drive is full, and then seems to give up and give me my disk space back. (I believe it is not a \"disk\" now, but I will stick with the terminology). Not only does it make my disk full at unpredictable times, it also uses a lot of memory.\nmds_stores appears to be the indexing program used by Spotlight; I am happy to disable both. I never use Spotlight.\nI have followed the suggestions at https://www.technipages.com/macos-sierra-enable-disable-spotlight , i.e. disable System Integrity Protection, run \nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\nand then re-enable System Integrity Protection. But it does not work. It does not appear to have disabled Spotlight (I can still see a magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of my status bar) and it certainly does not stop my real problem: mds_stores running and filling up my disk.\nI have also seen it suggested that I remove the index files via:\nsudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/*\nHowever on this version of Mac OS (10.15.4, Catalina), there is no directory /.Spotlight-V100\n20-Apr-20,15:26:46 ~> sudo ls -a /\nPassword:\n.           .VolumeIcon.icns    .vol            System          bin         etc         private         usr\n..          .file           Applications        Users           cores           home            sbin            var\n.DS_Store       .fseventsd      Library         Volumes         dev         opt         tmp\n\nI have also see the suggestion (at http://itechinspector.com/mds_stores-process-consuming-high-cpu-usage.html and also at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8658455 ) to run sudo mdutil -a -i off . When I originally posted this was not working, but when I tried later in the day it did work:\n20-Apr-20,21:35:27 ~> sudo mdutil -a -i off\nPassword:\n/:\n2020-04-20 21:35:40.665 mdutil[8406:156351] mdutil disabling Spotlight: / -> kMDConfigSearchLevelFSSearchOnly\n    Indexing disabled.\n/System/Volumes/Data:\n2020-04-20 21:35:40.778 mdutil[8406:156351] mdutil disabling Spotlight: /System/Volumes/Data -> kMDConfigSearchLevelFSSearchOnly\n    Indexing disabled.\n\n[It also gave me back a ton of disk space. I was sitting at 27 Gi free, which mds_stores would gradually gobble up. After running the above command, I suddenly have 55 Gi free; so I got back 28 Gi, more than 10% of my disk!]\nSo I appear to have a temporary fix, which I assume will go away next time I reboot. Does anyone know if that (or something else) disables Spotlight and mds_stores, permanently, for Catalina? (Because it looks like it might work a little differently to earlier Mac OS versions).\n\nA: In my experience, a failing disk and/or a disk filesystem that’s damaged or failing is the cause for most spotlight processes that run too long. Also, metadata importers that are added by programs like Office and others run to index their files and can cause issues.\nBefore you disable this entirely, have you opened the spotlight settings and added each user home folder to the privacy? This cleans all records of those user files from the database. Then you would restart the machine and perhaps boot to recovery HD and run Disk Utility to repair the disk.\nSometimes a clean install is all that’s needed - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/66690/5472\nClearly, spotlight needs to take one pass over all the data, but then it should quit. As you say, if you don’t need it, adding the folders you wish to not have indexed is the easy way to let the system index things it needs, but ignore your user files, database files and other things that might cause temporary or permanent resource usage. I could see some high transaction data based never getting indexed if they don’t tell spotlight to not index files.\n\n\n*\n\n*Preventing Spotlight from Indexing Files & Folders?\n\nA: It took me a while to find out why my MacBook always felt so hot, it was mds_store running constantly at 100% CPU.\nI tried all suggested solutions to get control over spotlight, including\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily turn off SIP to disable Spotlight\n\n*Turning off indexing on all drives (sudo mdutil -a -i off)\n\n*Killing the Task in ActivityMonitor\n\n*Uninstalling the Antivirus because of suspected indexing conflict\n\n*Adding all User Folders to Privacy\n\nNone of those steps did help. What helped instead was turning off the indexing for all of my Volumes:\nsudo mdutil -d /Volumes/MacintoshHDD\n\nReplace MacintoshHDD with the name of any drive listed in the Volumes folder and repeat until mds_store stops using 100% CPU.\nThe mdutil -d <Path> command disables Spotlight activity on a certain Volume while mdutil -i off <Path> turns indexing off. Guess when the indexing is in a \"deadlock\", turning it off is not enough to stop it.\nAfterwards, one can try to re-enable Spotlight with following command\nsudo mdutil -Ei on <Path>\n\nDoing so, the index for the specified Volume is erased and rebuilt and indexing is turned on again. Check for mds_store going crazy again.\n\nA: My mds_stores, kernel_task, corespotlightd and other processes related to spotlight, have written and read over 10tb on my ssd in couple of days. After tried all solutions I could find on internet, I finally solved it by dragging my user folder into privacy list of Spotlight. I have no idea what happened and what caused it. But this madness reduced my ssd life to 47% from nearly full. Guess that's why you need to buy apple care.\n", "Q: repair EXFAT external disk My photos disk seems to have issues.

Can a developer collect my photos that I edited and saved in my iPhone album?\nOne of the function of the an app I am using is to edit photos and save them to my iPhone's album. In this case, can the developer collect my edited photos?\nI did not upload any photos, nor did I share them with anybody.\nAlso, there is no mention of collecting user's content in the privacy policy of the said app.\nCan anyone help me with this?\n\nA: If an app allows you to edit photos, then yes of course it has access to your photos and can store them locally (or transmit them), would be rather difficult to modify photos otherwise. There is a whole bunch of apps in the Store who do exactly that (Google Photos, VSCO etc.).\nIf you suspect the app to upload photos without you knowing it may be worthwile to monitor its network traffic with tools like Charles or Proxyman, and inform Apple if necessary.\n\nA: Yes, if you give the application access to your photos and the application has network access, the photos can be taken from your iPhone.\nOnly use apps you trust\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do not trust the developer, do not install or use their applications.\n\n*If the developer is not clear and explicit about how they handle your photos, do not install or use their applications.\n\n*If the developer is not contactable or does not answer your questions, do not install or use their applications.\n\nA: Ask the developer\n\nCan a developer collect my photos that I edited and saved in my iPhone album?\n\nIn theory yes. An app that has access to your photos can read (obviously to work on them) and transmit it elsewhere (more so if it depends on an active Internet connection to provide a necessary functionality). You should consider contacting the developer and asking the question to them.\n\nAlso, there is no mention of collecting user's content in the privacy policy of the said app.\n\nSome answers have mentioned an approach involving analysing outgoing network traffic from the app. While it may help you establishing your belief to a certain degree, it may not be a straightforward thing to do if you are not technically savvy enough to do so. Network traffic analysis may not be a very simple thing to interpret for a casual user.\nInstead you could start by carefully reading through the app privacy policy and understanding what the developer says about handling users personal data.\nIf you do not get a conclusive explanation, I'd advise you consider contacting the developer of the app with your concerns. The way developer responds to the communication could help you get a much better clarity for your query.\nIf the developer doesn't respond to the communication for a reasonable time, you could consider raising your concern to Apple.\n\nA: Yes, the developer could theoretically collect photos that you edit within the app. \nIf you have granted the app access to your Photos library explicitly, then the app could potentially also collect those photos. If the app uses the Apple supplied image picker control, it can get a copy of a single photo that you select without you giving explicit access to the whole of the Photos library. This way the app can only access that single photo.\nIf the app does not explicitly state about such a collection clearly to the users, and it is not written in the app's privacy policy, such a collection would be a violation of their agreement with Apple - and depending on your jurisdiction - most likely also a violation of the law.\nI don't think there's necessarily any greater chance of a single person business violating rules and regulations than a company doing so. In some way, you could argue that it would be the other way around, as a named person could be less inclined to do shady stuff compared to an \"anonymous\" company not clearly linked with one or more individuals.\nYou can try to monitor the network traffic made by the app using a network mirror, a packet dumper or a proxy such mitmproxy (can be downloaded for free using Homebrew on a Mac). However, it is really difficult to ascertain whether or not your photos are being collected. The reason is that apps today are required to use encryption for network transfers, and as such, it can be difficult or impossible to identify your photos from other network traffic made by the app. \nHowever, if you're certain that the app is not supposed to use any network traffic - and traffic only occurs when you select a photo, and the amount of data matches your photo, it would be a strong indication that your photo is being uploaded somewhere.\nIn any case, if you have a strong suspicion of foul play, then contact Apple. They have the means to investigate and ultimately remove offending apps from the App Store.\n\nA: There is one more safety net here. Every iOS app, when submitted to the App Store, goes through a review process. If developers are doing anything shady in the background like transfering data straight after granting access to your Photos library without stating a reason for it clearly, Apple can reject the app and it won’t show up in the App Store.\n\nA: Does the app require network permissions? Photo editing can be done locally, without network access (at least, in theory). So, if the app doesn't need network permissions, it may be safer to use, in the sense that it would not be able to communicate with a server outside your phone, so cannot transmit your photos or data about your photos, to any server.\n", "Q: What is the name of the long cable/plug attachment on the MacBook MagSafe charger?

Basically I want to create to partitions on the external SSD drive, one for backups using time machine and one for windows 10 that I will boot externally.

(the AssetCacheLocatorUtil tool will enumerate any caching servers - I typically have these and I have verified that the commands you run will cache the updates properly)\n\n\nA: 10.15.5 appears to have broken the following command:\nsoftwareupdate -d --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version 10.15.5\nIt gives the following error now:\nSUPreferenceManager: Failed to set object of class: __NSCFConstantString for key: LastRecommendedMajorOSBundleIdentifier with error: Error Domain=SUPreferenceManagerErrorDomain Code=1 “(null)”\nThe command worked on 10.15.4.\n\nA: I'm running 10.15.6 and found the one thing that finally made it work for me, was adding the -d to the command. It still reported an error after about 75%, but the installer is in my /Applications/ folder and appears to be the whole thing.\nI also had more luck getting an installer when I didn't specify which version I wanted, and just let it download the latest version on its own. (Any time I specified the version it would error, but actually not work.)\n", "Q: Reset device list on Apple Developer Portal The limit of registered devices on the Apple Developer Portal has reached 100, and I can see a Reset button on devices list.\nI am just not sure what this reset button will do. Delete all the devices or delete selected devices?\nI cannot risk clicking on the button without knowing what it does since it's a company account. Can anyone please help me with this? \n\n\nA: From the Account Management - Apple Developer support page:\n\nResetting Your Device List Annually\nIf you are the Account Holder, you can reset your list of development devices each year using Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles. You can register up to 100 of each device type for testing and Ad Hoc distribution per membership year. At the start of your new membership year, Account Holders, Admins, and App Managers will be presented with the option to remove listed devices and restore the available device count to 100 when first signing in to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.\nAlthough you may remove a device from your account during the year, it will continue to count against your device limit. When resetting your list, make sure to remove all devices you no longer use for development before adding any new devices.\n\nNow, to answer your question:\n\nI am just not sure what this reset button will do. Delete all the devices or delete selected devices?\n\nYou can either remove all or selected devices.\nOnce every year, at the time of renewal of your Apple development program membership, you are given an option to remove registered device UDIDs and add new ones.\nAfter you click on the Reset button, you'd be presented with the list of all the devices currently added in the Developer Portal. You can choose what devices to carry over in the next membership year and what devices to drop. You can claim the slots occupied by the devices that you no longer wish to use in future.\nDuring the membership year, removing devices doesn't automatically free up the slot occupied by them (you get a limit of 100 development devices per year).\nSo if you have reached the limit and want to replace some of the devices with newer/different ones, this is your once in a year chance to do so.\n\nI cannot risk clicking on the button without knowing what it does since it's a company account. Can anyone please help me with this?\n\nClicking the reset button won't immediately reset the list of devices. So you need not worry about it. You'd be resented with on-screen-instructions to help with further action.\nIt would be advisable here to select and remove only those devices which are no longer being used for app development and/or testing. This would free up an equal number of slots for adding new/other devices during the year.\nNote: Removing a device does not prevent you from re-adding it into the Developer portal.\n", "Q: Backup without Time Machine I'm trying to downgrade from Catalina to Mojave, and I need to backup all of my files without backing up operating system files. Time Machine takes a backup of everything on the disk meaning that macOS Catalina files are also included. I need a way in which I can install macOS Mojave on my Mac and keep my personal data. What's the best way to backup a hard drive without Time Machine?\n\nA: You can try copying all of the home folders located in /Users. After copying all the folders there to the external hard drive, you should check if all the data you want is there. After that, you can boot from macOS Recovery and erase the startup disk. After doing that, use a bootable macOS Mojave installer to reinstall macOS on the Startup Disk.\nTo do that, first read this on creating bootable macOS Installers: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372.\nTo boot from that drive, you need to shutdown or restart your computer with the macOS Installer plugged in. Then, hold \"Option\" while the Mac is starting to boot from the installer. Once you are in, click reinstall macOS and choose your startup disk.\nAfter macOS Mojave is installed, boot from the internal startup disk. Finish setup and create a new user. Once you are in, copy all your home directories from the SSD to the /Users directory. Then go to System Preferences and create new users and set the home directories to the home folders that were copied and remove the user that was created at the setup of macOS Mojave. Reboot the machine and you technically have your data back.\nNOTE: Some compatibility issues may occur with personal files when switching from macOS Catalina to macOS Mojave.\n", "Q: Sharing Mac internet connection from wifi to Iphone USB not working (Mac OS Catalina) I normally share my MacBook Pro 13 2018 (on OSX 10.15.4 Catalina) internet wifi connection to my iPhone XS Max connected directly with a usb c to lightning cable. But now it stopped working and I see that Iphone USB doesn't appear anymore in the \"To computers using:\" box.\nI tried the solution offered here that says that I should add an new location under the network preference, with no avail.\nI also checked the solution offered here but the answer I don't understand why suddenly I would need content caching to share my internet connection. \nBluetooth sharing works, but the speed is very slow. Belkin usb-c lan, thunderbolt bridge and usb 10/100/1000 lan do not work.

On the Sharing Preference I have the the Internet Sharing on and the iPhone USB box checked.  In Content Caching I have the Internet Connection box checked.  The internet did not share to my iPhone SE when plugged in through the lightning cable. Another post recommended that I open a Finder window and click on my iPhone, and then allow the Mac mini and iPhone SE to \"trust\" each other when prompted. That seems to resolve the issue and internet worked through USB no problem. The iPhone USB box on Internet sharing did disappear once before I learned of the trust step and then the USB port stopped working altogether until I restarted. The Content Caching never works but the internet sharing through USB is fully functional at this time.\n\nA: Found a beginning of answer.\nIt seems that something weird is going on if you iPhone isn't connected to the internet through cellular.

It came with Mojave, I upgraded to Catalina after initial setup. Touch bar was working fine before and than after installing some applications, I noticed the touch bar disappeared and it was dark black. \nI did SMC reset and everything and it didn't came back. So I did Factory reset by erasing the drive and installing back OS. After erasing Catalina was the again the OS and touch bar didn't came back.\nI tried to start the processing again of factory reset again with the process to reintall OS that came with the device but again it showed me to reinstall Catalina instead of Mojave so I did this and again there was no touch bar.\nI tried to search for Touchbar in running processes and its not there. \nCan anyone please advise what could go wrong and if there is a solution for this?\n\nA: The Touch Bar on Apple's MacBook Pro line of laptops is a capactive touch display not unlike the screen in an iPhone; it's just much longer and thinner.  This means it's susceptible to all of the same ailments that plague every other touch screen display - cracked/broken LCD, touch no longer functioning, blank display, etc.  Some are obvious (i.e. a cracked screen) and others not so obvious; like a blank or non-responsive screen.\nIn this case, a blank Touch Bar could be either software or hardware.  So, to determine what the issue is, you need to go through a process of elimination.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Eliminate software as the cause. (See link for steps).  The idea here is to get to a \"clean\" environment by eliminating as many 3rd party apps, kexts, configurations, etc. that could be causing an issue.  You want to follow these steps so you don't go through the trouble of reinstalling macOS.  There's no point in expending the time, effort and risking data for something that won't work.  Booting into Safe Mode or Recovery Mode has the same benefits of reinstalling without the extra hassle.\n\n*It's likely hardware.  There a very good chance that the hardware has failed in some way.  It could be the display itself, the  driver (not software), or even the T1/T2 chip (drives the Touch Bar). Unfortunately, there's no easy DIY way to diagnose it.  Since the entire top case assembly must be disassembled to get to it, the usual fix is just to replace the top case with a new one.   \nBottom line, it needs to go in for service.\nNote:  the fingerprint reader (Touch ID sensor) is located adjacent to the display and both are behind a single pane of glass.  It's not uncommon for folks to believe that the Touch Bar must be working because Touch ID still works.  No; they are two completely different components, but since the T1/T2 chip handles security, it's a good bet that the chip is not at fault for the ailing Touch Bar.  \n\nA: sudo pkill TouchBarServer\n\nlink to a similar question\n", "Q: What options are there for dealing with MacBook Pro palm rejection problem? The trackpad in relation to the keyboard on all recent MacBook Pros (at least 2019 on) is either misplaced or too large (or both), creating a lot of palm-rejection problems.\nBackground: When placing your hands over the keyboard in the standard finger position (fingers on the \"a\",\"s\",\"d\" and \"f\" keys on the left hand and \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \";\" on the right hand) the palm covers the right 1/3 of the trackpad. For those who rest their palms of their hands on the laptop while they type, palm-rejection on the trackpad is necessary because the pad below the right thumb will hit the trackpad. palm-rejection will necessarily mis-identify some touches as finger strokes, creating a lot of trackpad noise while typing. (yes, the palm rejection is very good, but there are always going to be plenty of touches that misidentify because everyone is a little different).  The trackpad looks nice, but its placement is impractical (see Seagram Building)\nWhat options are available in software or hardware for altering the palm rejection or blocking the right 1/3 of the trackpad other than a piece of tape?\n\nA: Try turning off “tap to click”. It doesn’t solve palm rejection entirely, but at least your palm will stop clicking elsewhere in the document causing your input to be out of order etc.\n", "Q: Can't see list of screen resolutions anymore when Option-Clicking the Scaled button on macOS 10.15.4 I used to be able to Option-Click on Scaled button in the Display Preferences window to see a full list of resolutions, e.g., 1920x1080, 1280x720, etc. \nBut recently (started with 10.15.4, I think) this action does NOT reveal resolutions.

I know this is correct because I printed it.  The problem is, it's not always going to be 8.5x11 nor will the DPI always be the same (and I won't be there to \"know\" how it was printed/saved).\nFrom ImageMagic's page on using Identify they have a -verbose output flag and an example of \"calculating an image size at 72 DPI\" but they don't say how they got the DPI!\nHow can I programmatically determine the DPI of an image?\n(Graphics are bit out of my wheelhouse and with the sheer volume of ImageMagick's options along with terms I'm not familiar with is a bit like drinking from the fire hose.)   \n\nA: (Thanks to Tetsujin for his helpful comments leading me to the answer)\nImageMagick can get a little confusing with their myriad of options when you're attempting to do something.  There's a couple of ways that you can find out the DPI of an image.  Both of them use the identify command.\nFor the examples below, I'm using a sample, royalty free photo of an Apple iMac saved natively as a JPG and exported as a PNG.\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually calculating the size.  To do this, we need two pieces of information, the resolution and the Units.  In this case, we lucked out because the the units are in PPI (pixels per inch) so the resolution makes sense - it's 72 PPI or 72 DPI \nidentify -verbose apple_photo.jpeg | grep -E -i \"resolution|units\"                         \nResolution: 72x72\nUnits: PixelsPerInch\n\nHowever, if the image file is a PNG, things are stored as PPCM or pixels per centimeter.  Issuing the same command:\n% identify -verbose apple_photo.png | grep -E -i \"resolution|units\"\n  Resolution: 28.34x28.34\n  Units: PixelsPerCentimeter\n\nThis tells us that it's 28.34 PPCM.  To get DPI we have to do a little calculation.  1in = 2.54cm, so to get DPI we multiply that to the resolution as follows:\n2.54 * 28.34 = 71.9836 or 72DPI\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Real-time Calculation.  Again, using JPEG, we know that it's resolution is in DPI, so we just need to get the resolution value using the -format flag and the the percent (%) escape sequences:\nidentify -format \"%[fx:resolution.x]\" apple_photo.jpeg\n\nSince PNG files are in PPCM,  we can use the calculated FX expressions and the percent (%) escape sequences, to calculate this value. Here, we're getting the resolution value and multiplying it by 2.54 to get DPI.\n% identify -format \"%[fx:resolution.x*2.54] DPI\" apple_photo.png\n71.9836 DPI\n\nNote:  You can get the units using the %[units] escape sequence here:\n% identify - identify -format `\"%[units]\"` apple_photo.jpeg\n\nCalculate the size. We can now calculate the size (inches) of the image. Here, we use the %[w] escape sequence to get the width in DPI or PPCM\n    % identify -format \"%[fx:w]\" apple_photo.jpeg\n    3004\n\nDivide by 72 to get inches\n    % identify -format \"%[fx:w/72] inches\" apple_photo.jpeg\n    41.7222 inches\n\n\nA: This question really holds two separate questions:\nFirst the question is of the DPI of a document, and the file in question is a PDF file. PDF files are complicated in nature, and actually allows a single document to hold objects of varying DPIs.\nSo even though the PDF specifies a DPI for the document itself, this means that it doesn't always make sense to programmatically determine the DPI of a document, simply because there doesn't have to be one single DPI for all of the document's contents.\nThe command given in the question reads out numbers for the PDF document itself, but rather you want to get the information about the actual image object inside the PDF like this:\npdfimages -list document.pdf\n\nThis will list the number of pixels per inch for each image object contained within the document in the \"x-ppi\" and \"y-ppi\" columns.\nIf the PDF files always contain a single image, you can read out the PPI from this command as the way to programmatically obtain the PPI. Note that it might differ from the value you have from identify for the PDF document as a whole, even though the file contains just a single image.\nSecondary the question is about images in general - no file formats listed. Some of the most common file formats for images are JPEG and PNG files, which are simpler than PDF files.\nFor PNG files, the DPI is embedded in the pHY chunk that describes the physical pixel dimensions for the image. The DPI is allowed to be either unspecified, or specified in terms of an integer number of pixels per meter. Note - it is not stored in pixels per inch or pixels per centimeter, but rather as pixels per meter. This has implications for the precision of the values.\nFor JPEG files, the DPI is embedded in the JFIF APP0 marker segment that describes the X and Y density of the image as integers. The unit is similarly described in that segment as either unspecified, pixels per inch or pixels per centimeter. \nSo some JPEG files will have their density specified in pixels per inch, and others as pixels per centimeters.\nIn both cases you can use identify to extract the DPI information from the files:\nidentify -units PixelsPerInch -format '%[resolution.x] x %[resolution.y] %[units]' file.png\nidentify -units PixelsPerInch -format '%[resolution.x] x %[resolution.y] %[units]' file.jpeg\n\nNote that in this case we ask ImageMagick to convert the actual density information to pixels per inch instead of some times getting the value as pixels per centimeter, and some times as pixels per inch. ImageMagick does not support getting the numbers in their native unit, as only those units can be output by the program - and for example PNG files store it as pixels per meter (as described above) - so a conversion takes place in those cases anyways.\nFinal, and probably most important note: For bitmap images, such as JPEG and PNG files, the actual image data is \"DPI agnostics\". Meaning that if you change the DPI of the file from for example 72x72 to 200x200, the actual image data does not change at all. The density information is just a metadata field in the file, and it does not as such affect the actual image data. It only comes into play when printing the image on physical paper.\nWhat this means is that when processing \"random images\" for different sources, there's a high risk that the DPI information in the image is just some default value from the image processing software used. This means that you'll often see 72x72 DPI, but the value has no relation to the actual image data or how large the creator of the image actually thought it would be in the physical world (if he/she thought anything about that at all). Therefore it is typical not a good idea to rely on the DPI information for such \"random images\".\n", "Q: How can I use the output sound from GarageBand as my 'mic' for Skype or similar?

But, sometimes when I connect my MacBook (via ThunberBolt 3) or when it wakes from sleep already connected, it sends a 3440x1440 image to the monitor, which looks fuzzy and gets a warning from the monitor about the incorrect resolution.\nWhen this happens, the MacBook doesn't even give me the option of using the correct resolution in system preferences - even if I Option-click on Scaled, the highest resolution available is 3840x2160. This makes me suspect it's using DisplayPort 1.2 instead of 1.4, because I believe that's the maximum resolution DP 1.2 supports.\nSometimes disconnecting and reconnecting the cable fixes it, sometimes switching to a different TB3 port in the MacBook fixes it, sometimes rebooting the MacBook or the monitor fixes it, but nothing reliably fixes it, and sometimes I go through all of the above and still have the wrong resolution. (To reboot the monitor, I just unplug it from the wall, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in.)\nI mainly use the ThunderBolt 3 cable that came with the monitor, but I also tried a short passive TB3 cable - same results.\nIt also forgets the arrangement of the display relative to my MacBook's screen when using the wrong resolution; it remembers when it uses the correct resolution.\nIn  > About This Mac > System Report... > Graphics/Displays, it has the display connected to the Radeon Pro 550X with the following info:\nLG HDR 5K:\n  Resolution:   3440 x 1440 (UWQHD - Ultra-Wide Quad HD)\n  UI Looks like:    3440 x 1440 @ 60 Hz\n  Framebuffer Depth:    30-Bit Color (ARGB2101010)\n  Mirror:   Off\n  Online:   Yes\n  Rotation: Supported\n  Automatically Adjust Brightness:  No\n  Connection Type:  Thunderbolt/DisplayPort\n\nI'm currently on macOS Catalina 10.15.4, but this also happened on previous versions, including Mojave releases.\nIt also sometimes turns on HDR mode when using the wrong resolution, which just has the effect of making everything a little darker.

And it went away as soon as the computer went to sleep.\nI tried connecting a CalDigit USB-C Pro Dock (which is actually Thunderbolt 3, despite the name) and then connecting it's DisplayPort output to the monitor. The port on the dock is labeled 4k, but it can actually output the full 5120x2160 resolution - but only at 30hz. The low refresh rate is annoying but better than the fuzziness of 3440x1440@60hz, so I'm going with it for now. There were a couple of times where I had to disconnect and reconnect the DisplayPort cable to get any image out, but one re-connection fixed it each time, making it far more reliable than the direct TB3 connection.\nI've also ordered a generic USB-C to DisplayPort cable, so I'll update again after I've had a chance to try that.\n\nUpdate 2: USB Type-C to DisplayPort cable behaves about the same as the dock - correct resolution, but only 30hz refresh rate.\n\nUpdate 3: I got a hold of a Windows laptop with thunderbolt 3, and it worked perfectly on the first try, and again after I disconnected it and reconnected it. So I think that points to a problem with my MacBook.\n\nUpdate 4: I now have a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip. I switched the display back to DP 1.4 just to see if it would work, but it has the same symptoms as the older Intel MacBook. So, I'm back to DP 1.2, which usually works.\n(Occasionally the monitor will freeze when I wake the computer up, and the last time I rebooted the monitor to unfreeze it, the laptop crashed and rebooted as soon as the monitor came back on...)\n\nUpdate 5: I tried installing LG's \"OnScreen Control\" app and under monitor settings, it had a software update \"Run\" button that appears to have updated the monitor's firmware and resolved some of the issues. I went from (3.11, 0, 2.4) to (4.12, 16, 4.17), and I was able to switch back to DisplayPort 1.4 and get the correct resolution on the first try. I'll try to remember to post another update in a few months.\n\nA: i have got this same problem. by setting monitor to displayport version 1.2 i was able to run it in native resolution (5120x2160) in 60hz without major problems.\ninitially when i got the monitor out of the box i was able to run it in native resolution using display port version 1.4. then i installed LG's OnScreen control app on my mac, updated the monitor firmware using the app, the monitor started behaving as you described in displayport 1.4 mode. see the screencaps under about what resolution monitor supports in 1.4 mode and what firmware version im running.\n\n\nLG support said that this is mac driver problem. i have got no idea how to install any drivers.\nmacbook pro 13\"\nversion 11.0.1 (big sur)\nlate-2019\nIntel Iris Plus Graphics 655, 1536 mb\nim using the DP cable which came with the monitor.\n", "Q: Cannot type 'c' in Terminal - Restore Terminal to default settings I am new to terminal, learning how to code in Python.\nI was trying to turn the autocomplete tab function on, using the code found in the link below.\nhttps://timleland.com/how-to-enable-autocomplete-in-mac-terminal/\nI can now not type 'c'.

I want to write a shell script, run its commands via double-click, and stay open, to continue my work in the Terminal.\nI often create a standard shell script, and put them in a file, like \"myScript.command\".  This type of file allows me to double-click on it, and run the script inside, but these exit on completion.  I want the session to stay open, instead of automatically exiting, so that I can continue from where the script ended.  I've seen suggestions to use &, and wrapping with ( ), but that still exits.\nI've tried things from this thread How to prevent the application launched in Terminal from undesirably exiting? but it wasn't what I needed.\nI'm hoping it's some easy switch, or pipe.\nThanks!\n\nA: As the final step in your script you can make it run a shell for you - just put the shell as the final line, eg. bash, or zsh.\nThat'll then drop you into the Terminal, within the script, and you'll get access to it's environment too.\nHowever, that'll also stop your scripts from running to completion if you're not running them interactively. You could test for that and handle it as part of your script. Do it often enough and it might be worth making a shell function for it and sourcing it in from a standard location.\nOr, since what you seem to want is just an easy way to run scripts, you can setup a bunch of aliases for them in your shell rc file (.zshrc or .bashrc), and have them available to call when you want them. That way you'll still be able to continue your work, and it's easy to re-run the script too - just run the alias again.\n", "Q: How do I verify the checksum or hash of a downloaded file on the command line? If I have downloaded a file from the internet, and the source website has provided a checksum or hash (eg. SHA-256), how do I verify that the hash of the downloaded file matches the hash reported on the site?\nFor example, I’ve downloaded a file, and the website states that the SHA-256 hash for it is:\nd9cd63f187db2daea1371289508c63a7a24c46316f15ac61f030a7d6ea423915\n\nI do know how to create an SHA-256 hash of the downloaded file using:\nshasum -a 256 /path/to/downloaded.pkg\n\nHowever, I don’t want to do a manual, a.k.a. eyeball, check of the hash. Instead I want to compare the two hashes using a command like diff, preferably by executing a single command-line.\n\nA: When you first calculate the sum of a file, it produces an output consisting of the sum, two spaces, and the name of the file that produced that sum. If you redirect that output to a file, you can later use the \"-c\" (for \"check\") option to automatically check every file listed, to see if the sum still matches.\nSo, create a text file called \"checksum.txt\" with one line:\nd9cd63f187db2daea1371289508c63a7a24c46316f15ac61f030a7d6ea423915  downloaded.pkg\n\nThen run the command:\nshasum -a 256 -c checksum.txt\n\nThe command will calculate the sha-256 checksum of the file \"downloaded.pkg\", compare the result with the precomputed value, and tell you if it matched or not.\nYou might not even have to create the sum file yourself; most of the time, websites that provide checksums will let you download a text file that's already in the proper format.\n\nA: You have already received answers on how to do an automatised comparison of the two hash values to ensure they are completely alike. I just wanted to add a different angle on how to compare the hash values.\nActually it is in almost any case enough to to an \"eyeball comparison\". I.e. if you check that first few characters and the last few characters are the same, and it \"looks the same\" - then this is a really good verification.\nIf you're trying to do an automatised comparison \"by heart\", there's a risk that you accidentally enter the wrong command line or somehow subtly alter the meaning of the command. \nThe alternative to doing it by heart is to spend time finding and cutting-pasting the script/command line every time you need to check. This can lead to situations where we simply forego the check, because we're in a hurry or feel it is low risk. \nThe reason why an \"eyeball comparison\" is most often enough is that for an attacker it is really, really hard to create a file with a SHA-256 hash that is \"almost the same\" as for the original file. It's almost as hard as creating a SHA-256 hash that is the same as for the original file. You could probably assume that if they can create one, they can create the other.\nThe properties of SHA-256 (and indeed any cryptographic hash) is such that even the slightest change to the file results in a widely different hash value.\n\nA: You can compare the checksum directly with a bash function:\nfunction checksha256() {\n    # Usage: checksha256 file checksum\n    if [[ $(shasum -a 256 \"$1\" | cut -f 1 -d' ') == \"$2\" ]]; then\n        echo Match\n    else\n        echo No match\n    fi\n}\n\nor\nfunction checksha256() {\n    # Usage: checksha256 file checksum\n    echo \"$1  $2\" | shasum -s -a 256 -c\n}\n\nThe two spaces are important in this case because that's the format shasum expects.\n\nA: One solution is to use diff to compare strings of the two hashes. Fortunately, this can be done in a single command-line entry as follows:\ndiff -is <(echo \"d9cd63f187db2daea1371289508c63a7a24c46316f15ac61f030a7d6ea423915  /path/to/downloaded.pkg\") <(shasum -a 256 /path/to/downloaded.pkg)\n\nAn important note: There must be two spaces between the hash in the first part of the term and the path to your downloaded file.\nAs an alternative, one can use shasum's built-in check option:\necho \"d9cd63f187db2daea1371289508c63a7a24c46316f15ac61f030a7d6ea423915  /path/to/downloaded.pkg\" | shasum -a 256 -c\n\nPortions of this answer exist in various places, but despite avid searching I haven’t found that it’s been put together anywhere. If there are better alternatives, I’d be happy to hear of them.\n\nA: In case anyone else arrives from google wanting to know how to get the checksum of a file:\nshasum -a 256 /path/to/file.txt\n\nI found it in @TransferOrbit's answer.\n", "Q: Is it possible to automatically show apps which are installed to \"~/Applications\" in the system's \"Applications\" folder?

The Mac has similar controls if the lid is closed.

And what conditions do I need to meet in order for this to happen automatically (i.e. the iPhone/iPad needs to be connected to power)?\n\nA: You need to set up iTunes to allow you to do the backup over WiFi and you need to sync the two devices at least once. After that you should be able to do it, provided;\n\n\n*\n\n*Both devices must be on the same WiFi network\n\n*iTunes must be open on the Mac \n\n*The iOS device must be charging\n\n\nA: No, there's no option in iTunes or Finder to make scheduled backups, they must be started manually (backup during sync is still a manual backup).

There seem to be a lot of people who've tried AmpliFi, had problems, then switched to UniFi and been very happy.\nAlso personally having used UniFi at four separate installations over several years I have never encountered any problems of any kind at all. UniFi just works perfectly and forever.\nIt does take a bit more effort to setup, but not that much. Certainly easier than troubleshooting the issue you're experiencing now, and it should then operate for the next decade without being touched.\nUniFi uses a wired backhaul instead of a wireless one which frees up radio spectrum and reduces latency. It's also cheaper. Yay.\nWithout knowing the size or layout of your house, it's difficult to recommend which UniFi products you should go for. Generally though the short range ones are better if you're going with a \"mesh\" setup. In fact it's often recommended to configure them to operate at the lowest possible power level to prevent devices connecting to the wrong hotspot.\nFor about half of the installations I've done though, a single access point has been more than enough, so I'd start with just one.\nUniFi lacks advanced features such as firewalls/etc. If you need that, get an EdgeRouter X. If you don't need it, you should be able to just plug the UniFi AP's into your cable modem.\n", "Q: kernel_task on Macbook hogging CPU even after OS upgrades/downgrades; possible Flash malware? On a Macbook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) my girlfriend got one of those \"upgrade Flash\" pop-ups and hit (Continue/Okay/etc?). This may or may not have anything to do with the current problem but ever since, the kernel_task has been hogging the CPU to the point at which the computer is so slow as to be unusable. In Activity Monitor, the % CPU of kernel_task is is a constant 220-450. The CPU load is a constant 75%-90%, although the computer is not getting hot.\nHere is what I have done so far. I've reset the SMC and NVRAM/PRAM multiple times. I upgraded to the newest OS, Catalina. I downgraded to the original OS for this laptop, El Capitan. I upgraded and downgraded more than once and each time, the issue remains. The installation of the OSes took forever, as well; been working on this problem for 4 or 5 days now. Oh, and booting in safe mode doesn't help, either. Anyway, two questions:\n1) Is it possible for a Flash malware thing to install/configure something in the kernel that remains after re-installing the OS?\n2) Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: When a system is infected with malware, the best course of action is format the drive and restore known-good backup from before the malware infection. \nIf you just reinstall the operating system on top of your infected system, while keeping all your own files on your drive, you're in high risk of keeping the malware - and/or simply reinfecting the system quickly after the upgrade.\nIn theory malware could change the firmware of the SMC or something like that, to persist even when the drive is formatted - but in practice Flash malware is very unlikely to do so.\nHowever, I'm not entirely convinced that your problem with kernel_task is related to the malware. I would suggest rebooting your computer into \"Recovery mode\" by holding the Command and R buttons during boot. When in \"Recovery Mode\", open the Terminal and run the command:\ntop -ocpu\n\nThis should show a live updating overview of the currently running processes, sorted with the most CPU using process at the top.\nIf you still have kernel_task at the top spot with a large percentage, the problem is most likely unrelated to the malware, and could instead indicate a hardware problem regarding cooling. This could be a problem with a fan not operating properly, cooling paste, or even a sensor issue.\n", "Q: How can FileVault encryption process be stopped/disabled?

Now we want to include our mom in, and save some money, so we would like to upgrade to the family plan at $9.99 per month for 2Tb. I understand that one of us will have to upgrade their plan and then share the plan with the rest of the family, and Apple will charge that person the price of the higher tier plan, minus the prorated cost of their previous plan. My question is, will Apple refund the prorated cost to 3 other people who will cancel their personal plan to join the family plan - or they will be charged for the entirety of the billing period just like what usually happens with other Apple services such as Apple music?\n\nA: According to Apple:\n\nIf a family member is already paying for their own iCloud storage plan, they can choose to switch to your plan or keep their own and still remain part of the family. When they switch to the shared family plan, they get a refund for the remainder of their personal plan.

If you forget to sign out, you might not be able to use your device when your account is deleted.\nWill the email handle be immediately put back in to the available pool, will there be a delay, will it never be allowed for re-registration... ?\nAs commented above, Apple support told me the email address couldn't be used  as an Apple ID again, so re-registration doesn't seem to be possible.\nYou may want to contact Apple support to confirm this.\n", "Q: Can I remove a Family Sharing child by deleting his account? I started Family Sharing and created a new account for my child, but I was forced to create an icloud.com account, which is not desirable. He already has a Google Account, which may be favourable.\nBecause he is under 13, I find I cannot actually remove the recently-created account from the family, only transfer him to another family.\nIt seems possible to self-delete the child's account whilst logged-in as him, which generates a request for parental approval by me.\nHowever, will this also achieve the aim of removing him from Family Sharing? I assume, if the child account which had been added to Family Sharing no longer exists, it cannot be a part of Family Sharing.\nAnd then I could start again, creating a new Apple ID using his Gmail address.\n\nA: If you want to maintain the gMail address, you can use that as the Apple ID for the child.\nSource.\nRemoving Kids 13 and Under From Family Sharing\nApple doesn't allow you to remove a child under the age of 13 from your Family Sharing (in the U.S., at least; the age is different in other countries). When you add a child that young to your Family Sharing group, they're there to stay until they turn 13.\nIf you started Family Sharing and added a child under 13, you can't remove them on your own. You have a few ways you can potentially get out of this situation:\nDisband the family\nYou can disband the entire Family Sharing group and start again. When you create the new group, don't add the child under 13. If you and the child are the only people on your Family Sharing list, you need to transfer them before you can stop Family Sharing.\nTransfer the child to another family\nWhen you add a child under 13 to Family Sharing, you can't delete them, but you can transfer them to another Family Sharing group. To do that, the organizer of another Family Sharing group needs to invite the child to join their group. In this case, the child's Family Sharing account won't be deleted, but it won't be your responsibility any longer.\nCall Apple\nIf transferring a child to another Family Sharing group isn't an option, call Apple. While the company doesn't give you a way to remove a child from Family Sharing, it has other tools that can help. Call 1-800-MY-APPLE and talk to someone who can provide support for iCloud.\nNote:\nWhen you call Apple, make sure you have all of the relevant information handy. The customer service representative will need the email address for the account of the child you want to remove. You'll also need a device handy so that you can access your own Apple ID. Apple Support will walk you through the process of removing the child, though the official removal can take up to 7 days. \n\nA: You cannot remove a child from a family and if you don't want to deal with creating a new family to move the child to, or disband your family, Apple is very unhelpful. However, you may remove it once the child reaches 13 years of age. So, if you want to remove it from your account this is what you can do if you intend on removing the account from your family. You may also delete the account once your done.\nContact apple and tell them you entered the incorrect birthday for your child's account. They will unlock the birthday field, which may only be done once.\nOnce unlocked, update the birthday so that it will turn 13 the next day. For example, if the current day is 11/27/2020, set the birthday to 11/28/2007. Setting it to a date just under 13 is key, because Apple won't let you pick a date that will make the account older than 13 when you're editing it. At midnight, the account will turn 13, allowing you to remove the account from the family. Once removed, login to the account, and delete it (if you wish).\n\nA: You can't remove a child under 13 from your family sharing group but you can transfer them.\nI was unable to transfer using my iPhone.  My wife would never the transfer request. But I was able to do it successfully via my Mac.\n\nA: If you want, you can delete your child's apple id which will require organizer/parent approval.\nTo delete your child's apple id, follow this step\n\n*\n\n*Login to data & privacy using your child apple id\n\n*Click request to delete your account\n\n*Send parental consent to delete your child's apple id\n\n*Check your device/email to approve the apple id deletion\n\n*Follow the next step\n\n\nA: The email address is unrelated to the Apple ID: you don't have to use the actual email address that you use as your apple id. You can create a somebody@icloud.com, then change the contact email address to your gmail address, and simply never use the icloud.com address. I do this: this means my actual email address is not available if someone sees my Apple ID.\nYou need to log in as your son to change the contact email address in the account settings. Then you can use the gmail address as the contact email, where Apple will send emails and even second factors.\n", "Q: Cannot remove wrong autocorrect/predicitve text language I want my iPhone keyboard's autocorrect and predictive text to be English only, but it somehow it is set to both English and French at the same time.  For example if I type \"tress\" then it shows \"très\" as a prediction.  If I then press space it autocorrects to \"très\".\nFrench is not selected in my keyboard settings (Settings -> General -> Keyboard) nor in my dictionary settings (Settings -> General -> Dictionary).  These are the two places that one needs to change according to online resources.\n\nA: When I removed \"French\" from \"Settings -> General -> Language & Region -> Other languages\" then the problem disappeared.\n", "Q: Client certificate authentication fails with iOS 13.4.1 (works with 13.2.2) I've previously posted this question and since then further investigated the issue.\nThe problem seems to be the latest iOS (13.4.1), which fails to send the client certificate upon authentication requests.\nTo test this, I've set up a webserver, requiring a client certificate for authentication. The client certificate is installed on the iPhone. If I navigate to the website, iOS states that a client certificate is required and asks to use the installed one. Once I press continue the connection fails as no certificate is presented to the server.\nExactly the same setup on iOS 13.2.2 works as expected. Client certificate is installed, website is accessed, iOS asks about sending the certificate, iOS does so and access works fine.\nI've written a bug report to Apple but have yet to hear from them.\nUpdate: iPadOS 13.3.1 also works as expected.\nUpdate: iOS Beta 13.4.5 has the same issue.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this issue or is this an isolated case for me? I've even hard-reset the iPhone to check if it was a problem with my setup.\n\nA: Requirements for trusted certificates in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15\nDoes the client certificate meet Apple's latest certificate requirements?\n\nAll TLS server certificates must comply with these new security requirements in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*TLS server certificates and issuing CAs using RSA keys must use key sizes greater than or equal to 2048 bits. Certificates using RSA key sizes smaller than 2048 bits are no longer trusted for TLS.\n  \n*TLS server certificates and issuing CAs must use a hash algorithm from the SHA-2 family in the signature algorithm. SHA-1 signed certificates are no longer trusted for TLS.\n  \n*TLS server certificates must present the DNS name of the server in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the certificate. DNS names in the CommonName of a certificate are no longer trusted.\n  \n\nWhile the document mentions server certificates, I suspect client certificates will also be rejected if they using SHA-1 or weak keys.\nDebugging with openssl s_server\nTry debugging the TLS connection with OpenSSL's test server, see Verify Incoming SSL Using OpenSSL S_Server for a related question.\n\nA: After reaching out to Apple via official bug reports, twitter and their discussions board and no feedback, this finally seems to be fixed in the iOS BETA 13.5 (17F5065a).\n", "Q: Peripherals and the new Macbook's USB C system My Mac currently has several USB C ports. Would it be possible to connect peripherals to the computer using the USB C to USB adapter which Apple has to offer. And would they work?\n\nA: Yes. The USB type‑C plug has pins that directly connect to the USB type‑A receptacle  pins. If you have a device that requires a USB A port, then you can use the adaptor to connect the device to a USB C port on the Mac. Still, I would recommend checking to see if your Mac is listed as compatible at the link you provided.\nI should point out there are many cheaper Apple compatible adaptors available, especially if the device requires USB 2.0.\nBasically, the adaptor just has wires connecting the plug to the receptacle.\nUSB Type-A Connector Pin Assignment\n\n\n\nNote: USB type-C plugs are reversible.\n\n   Plug Pin Equivalence\n\nType A Plug      Type C Plug\n-----------   ------------\nVCC (VBUS)    + V\nD-            D-\nD+            D+\nGND           GND\nStdA_SSRX-    RX1- or RX2-\nStdA_SSRX+    RX1+ or RX2+\nGND_DRAIN     GND\nStdA_SSTX-    TX1- or TX2-\nStdA_SSTX+    TX2+ or TX2+\n\nReferences\nUSB 3.0\nUSB-C\nUSB Type C 3.1 PD to get DC20V output\n", "Q: Setting GUI Visible Environment Variables with OS Catalina I need to set a number of Environment variables that can be seen by GUI apps (i.e. Xcode). When running from a terminal this is trivial and is simply a case of adding a. number of export commands to my .bash_profile e.g.\nexport BOOST_INCLUDE=~/boost/boost-XXXX/boost\n\nUnfortunately GUI apps do not see values set in .bash_profile. I am using Catalina and it appears that Apple modifies the mechanism every time MacOs is updated. Many online guides are out of date....\nThis article: http://www.dowdandassociates.com/blog/content/howto-set-an-environment-variable-in-mac-os-x-launchd-plist/ suggests that launchctl should do what I need but even the following simple example does not work:\nIn a terminal:\n/bin/launchctl setenv FOO BAR\n\nThen close the terminal and open a new one\nCheck the value:\necho $FOO\n\nThe output should be \nBAR\n\nBut it is unset. Note it is also unset in the original terminal so I am not convinced that the command /bin/launchctl setenv FOO BAR is doing anything.\nNote: This is about setting the environment variable for GUI apps NOT just for the terminal.\n\nA: Run launchctl setenv FOO BAR in Terminal.app, then quit (Cmd-Q) and restart Terminal.\n\nA: As far as I know “environment variables” set via launchctl are not visible in the shell and vice versa. Therefore I set some variables with launchctl and as shell variables (in my shell init file), if I need them in both, e.g. JAVA_HOME\n", "Q: How can I turn off music automatically starting after phone call in iPhone I use an iPhone 11 with a Sennheiser noise cancelling PXC 550-II Bluetooth headset.\nEvery time I end a phone call, the iPhone starts playing a seemingly random song from my music library. I understand the benefit from pausing music during a phone call, but when music was turned off before the call, I expect it to stay that way after the call.\nI looked, and it seems MacOS has similar issues, but there is no mention (or solution) for the iPhone.\nSo is it \n\n\n*\n\n*Me, because I overlooked a setting in iPhone\n\n*some bug in IOS, or\n\n*the Sennheiser headset?\n\n\nI sort of hope for 1) because that would be a quick fix instead of having to report bugs to the vendors.\n\nA: My guess is that it is a (typically) poor implementation in the bluetooth headset.\nI have the same issue with two different cars that are connected to the iPhone via bluetooth. I guess the developer writing the code for the device couldn't imagine that anyone wasn't listening to music, so he hardcoded to start the music after the call ends.\nI could not find a solution in many years, and have now disconnected my iPhone from the car for that reason. Obviously not useful for you, as a bluetooth headset that is not connected is useless (whereas the car still drives).\n", "Q: Enable ear detection to pause music when using AirPods Pro on a MacBook Pro Is it possible to enable the \"ear detection\" function to play/pause the music when one of the AirPods Pro is removed?

I use Emacs.app from https://emacsformacosx.com/. For all previous Mac OS versions, the command\nopen -a /Applications/Emacs.app myfile\nwould, initially, start a new Emacs process and open my file; if Emacs was already open, it would open a new buffer for that file. \nNow, in Catalina, it either (a) starts a completely new copy of Emacs with that file open, or sometimes, if Emacs is running already, (b) does nothing, neither of which is what I want.\nAny ideas how to get the old behavior back?\n\nA: Might be easier to use ˋemacsclientˋ:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add (server-start) to your .emacs file\n\n*Run emacsclient FILE to open a file in a running Emacs\n\n", "Q: Launch terminal program from macOS app I use Fork and I'm trying to set up a custom command that will open a file in Vim.

As a result of this, it was reported to me that the main issue was it appeared as if the shift key would intermittently press even when it was not.  As a result it is impossible to login in as random shifts are occurring making it impossible to enter the correct password.\nI tried plugging in an external circa 2011 iMac wired USB keyboard I had, but at the login screen nothing happens when I type on it.  I tried plugging it in before powering up, once I have gotten to the login screen, and in all the available USB (A) ports.\nI tried resetting the PRAM but holding down command+option+p+r before the screen comes on doesn't seem to do anything, it just boots up normally.  The same thing with command+s for single-user mode or command+r for recovery mode.\nI was able to reset the SMC but this just dumps me to a screen where if I say \"My keyboard isn't working when typing my password to log in\" it tells me \"if you were unable to use your keyboard to type your password it may not be compatible with file vault\".  It then wants me to enter a password to disable file vault, which of course if I could do I wouldn't need to be here in the first place.\nHow can I log in using the external interface?  I tried searching for what keyboards are compatible with file vault but just got results about disabling it, which in unhelpful.  Other answers simply suggest a USB keyboard should just work.   Since it's an Apple keyboard I expected it to just work.\nUpdate: Is there some way to reveal the characters I am typing into the password field? If I could see what I was typing, I could keep trying on each character until the case was right.  Or, if I could get it to actually show me my username instead of dots I could enter it there and try to copy it to the password field or at least get an idea when the shift key might be working.\n\nA: You need to replace the MacBook keyboard.\n(Or at least disconnect it from the logic board)\nThe problem is you have two keyboards \"battling\" it out for what keys get pressed.  The top case assembly which consists of the track pad and the keyboard are both USB devices.  You can have several of these devices plugged in simultaneously - in fact, I have 3 keyboards and one mouse (2 keyboards are for macros) and the iMac happily accepts input from all three simultaneously.\nWhat's happening is you're keyboard is still plugged in and the ⇧ Shift key is acting like it's being pressed because the contacts are shorting out.  I wrote a lengthy answer on this very topic:  Keyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix.  So, even though it's a different keyboard, you're Mac doesn't know; actually it doesn't even care.  It's going to process each key press as if you wanted it that way.\nYou're only (temp) solution is to disconnect it from the logic board.  There's no amount of resetting the NVRAM and/or the SMC, re-installation of the OS, etc. is going to bypass a physical problem.  \nYou have a liquid damaged MacBook which means there's probably much more damage - like corrosion of the electrical contacts - that you're going to have to contend with.  Take it in for service!\n\nBelow is an image from iFixit.com showing the location of the keyboard connector.  Disconnect this to get your external keyboard working again.

It's very fast way to test Linux stuff, but it's commandline only.\nI wish to test also stuff like XFCE and LXDE, but using the Virtualbox Console is slow and the usability bad.\nWhat are the different ways of using GUI apps and full desktop environments?\nThe site alternativeto.net lists Wayland as an XQuartz alternative, but there seems no macOS client.\n\nA: X11 in general is not really \"obsolete\". \nYou compare it to Wayland, but Wayland has only very recently become something that can be used in a standard install of Linux for example. It still has rough edges and use cases that are not implemented at all - so many Linux distributions has X11 as the default, or if they default to Wayland they have an option to use X11 instead.\nFor connecting to Linux VMs with desktop environments like XFCE and LXDE, I would still recommend X11 as the best option. \nYou can use XQuartz, or you could use for example the xorg-server package from MacPorts, which has a more recent version of basically the same software as XQuartz).\nPerhaps a better alternative would be use the X2Go (free) or NoMachine NX (commercial) software for accessing your X11 system from macOS. \nAnother option would be to use VNC. Many VNC clients exists for Mac, and Linux has software like x11vnc that exposes X11 software (such as XFCE and LXDE environments) over VNC. The VNC protocol works substantially different than the X protocol, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're using this on a more permanent basis, as you probably will see some degradation of graphics quality, and you would loose the ability to have individual X11 apps appear as individual windows in macOS.\nConsidering Wayland on macOS. You would actually not need a client as you write, it is the server you're after. However, as you're trying to access a Linux VM over a network (even though it is locally on the same machine) - this is not natively supported by Wayland. The standard Wayland setup requires the clients (individual applications) and the server (what actually handles the composition of all the applications onto the displays) to be on the same computer. There are some, very new, attempts at accessing Wayland remotely over the network - but currently they actually just work like a VNC server would. I.e. there's no advantage to using Wayland here.\n", "Q: Apple iPad USB stick showing \"External: open dir error, path = / \" Greetings dear community.\nI bought a 128 USB stick for my Gilrfriend's Mac which works solely with an app called LUV-Share.\nThe USB was brand new and was supposed to store HD movies, which are above 4GB.

I tried it and the system pops up a window saying \"Finder is not showing hidden files\".\nAny ideas as to why it might stop working and how I can fix it?\n\nA: I've run across this recently and the way I got it working again was to \"refresh\" the Finder window.  Since there's no refresh F5 like there is in Windows, you have to move out of the directory and then back in.  Additional, you can close the Finder window and reopen it. \nIt seems to be a bug within Finder\n\nA: According to this answer to a related thread, https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/409800/176692, Apple has unfortunately given this shortcut double-duty in recent updates of Finder.  There are two new shortcuts that let you move backward and forward through a Finder tab's browsing history (i.e., they are equivalent to clicking on the left and right arrows at the top left of a Finder window):\n\n*\n\n*backward: ⌘ Command⇧ Shift,\n\n*forward: ⌘ Command⇧ Shift.\nThe latter unfortunately overrides the ⌘ Command⇧ Shift. shortcut for toggling the hidden file (\"dot file\") view.

I'm happy to buy an app if that will do it.\nPlan B is to use the iPhone and AirPods only for listening, and use a separate camera.  But I don't have a separate camera that has a good microphone, so I'd have to live with the lousy audio, or buy new camera & mic hardware, maybe a vidcast setup.\n\nA: I believe as long as your AirPods are connected they will be used as the default microphone input, so any video recording software will work fine.\nFor example, in QuickTime Player, go to File > New Movie Recording. Then click on the arrow next to the record button and you can select exactly which microphone and video inputs to use if it's not already default.\n", "Q: Help needed to add text to the end of a string using the \"sed\" command in Terminal In Terminal.app, I used the curl ftp... command to get a directory listing of folders and files from my friend's computer and I directed the output to a file called \"curlFTP.txt\".

I do not have the pro pack for alfred, btw, but I have used quicksilver for 15+ years and don't want to buy alfred for one purpose if everything else is solid with quicksilver.

I think $30+ for the alfred powerpack just to test if it'll work properly is a bit steep. I don't mind paying for good software, but there's only one feature I need and I cannot tell if it'll work now or continue to later. any recommendations MUST work with both text and images or lasso segments of images that have been copied, or at least allow the main clipboard to still properly handle those images outside of the clipboard manager app.\nI'm not sure if it'll matter with your suggestions, but it should be known that because of a few legacy apps, I won't be going past 10.14.x for the foreseeable future. I don't know if it's an issue based on 10.14 as I don't recall the apps having issues like the one I have now long ago, just that I didn't like the interface of most of them.\n\nA: I can confirm, Alfred does the job.\nTo be sure, I double checked by testing its clipboard functionality for your requirements: partial (lasso) screenshots, fullscreen screenshots and image files. Everything works fine and shows up just as expected in Alfreds clipboard manager. Pasting inside a document works, whereas saving the screenshot from clipboard into a file using finder, doesn't work.

I never used it so I returned to using the MBP's direct power adapter without the extension.\nI have been working without extension for a couple of weeks and it was fine except today.  I saw one blink again, without any extension.\nSo I'm just curious (and a bit nervous because i can't go outside), is this some kind of static electricity that turns the display off and on for a second or is it a hardware or software problem?\nIt happens quite rarely but makes me write this question.\n\nA: For any power related issues with a Mac I would recommend you try one time an SMC reset: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295. As Apple puts it: “Resetting the system management controller (SMC) can resolve certain issues related to power, battery, and other features.”\nIf that procedure doesn’t fix your issue you might want to have Apple technicians run deeper tests on your hardware by booking a service appointment.\n", "Q: Audio player for transcribing and taking notes of meeting recordings I am looking for a macOS audioplayer that helps me to relisten to my recorded meetings and at the same time make notes. \nThe player should\n\n\n*\n\n*support global hotkeys (without requiring the app to be in the foreground) for rewinding a few seconds, pause, and play\n\n*and also allow adjusting the playing speed (e.g., 1.5x).\n\n\nI have tried several solutions yet: VLC, iTunes, QuickTime. But none of these fulfilled all of my requirements.\nCurrently, I am using otranscribe.com which is tedious to use as it only supports some very basic formatting (e.g., not bullet points) in the text section. Because of that I am using GoogleDocs to write my notes which requires skipping back and forth between tabs.  \nDo you have any suggestions? A free solution would be nice but I am also open for paid/commercial solutions.\n\nA: I finally ended up using VLC player which provides (non-global) shortcuts for the required functions (e.g., ␣ for play/pause, ⌘+⌃+← for a very short backward skip).\nI then used BetterTouchTools to allow invoking these shortcuts globally by adding new keyboard shortcuts that use the action send shortcut to specific app to forward the custom-defined global shortcuts to VLC.\n", "Q: brew update fails wtih fatal: could not read Username $ brew update\nfatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled\nfatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled\nError: homebrew/homebrew-dupes does not exist!

I've been tearing my hair out over this one: when recording audio or video with my iPhone, I can't figure out how to use the lightning port for an audio-in signal.\nFor example, I'm filming someone playing an instrument, and I want to use the audio-out of that instrument as the direct sound source for the video. (without holding a microphone near the speakers...)\nI have tried a 3.5mm 4-pin minijack cable from the instrument to the iPhone (with the minijack to lightning converter) but this 4-pin audio cable is not recognised as a microphone/sound input. I have also read an article about soldering your own cable with the right resistor values, but that can't be the only way to record audio on an iPhone???\nThe only microphone that gets recognised is the one that is built in the official apple EarPods. \nHow can I record an audio source directly into my iPhone?\n\nA: You need a Lightning audio interface. There's a lot of different products in various price ranges from a number of makers. Note that there are some that are targetted at specific instruments such as guitar or bass, or microphones - and some have multiple types of inputs.\nYou could for example take a look at the Line 6 Sonic Port audio interface for Lightning or similar.\nIf you want something for 3.5mm minijack, you could instead look at the Tascam iXZ Microphone and Audio Interface for iOS (approx. 60$). \nAny assorted music store, or online vendors such as Amazon, has multiple types of these products. Some cheaper than the these, some much more expensive.\n", "Q: Deleting an App that refuses to go away I have been trying to delete the United Airlines app from my iPad because I won't be needing it anytime soon.  I thought I had successfully deleted it but a gray version keeps reappearing.  I've deleted the gray version several times with no success.  \nWhat can I do to delete it permanently?\n\nA: I usually do the same thing when installing or deleting stalls, put the device in airplane mode, turn off WiFi, turn off Bluetooth and power it down. \nWhen it starts, delete the app, then enable communications as desired. \nWhen that fails, it’s easy to collect diagnostic information and send to Apple, but usually it’s a stuck network or storage issue that starting with a clean OS start in trolls whatever process was jammed. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2017 without Touchbar Not Charging I just got a used MacBook Pro, 2017 without the Touchbar.  It has 2 USB-C Ports on the side.  I'm not using mobile much, but I do sometimes.  At my desk I'm using a USB-C device that gives me an HDMI, USB-A, and USB-C port for charging.  \nI've noticed that while everything is plugged in and the laptop is on everything seems to work fine.  However, if the laptop is asleep the system stops charging.  It only seems to charge asleep when the charger is directly connected to the computer.  I've reset the SMC twice and the NVRAM and this is a fresh copy of macOS installed via Internet Recovery.\nIs this normal behavior?\nI'm concerned because I bought the laptop used from a computer shop and I have a limited window to bring it back to them if it is faulty.  I just don't know if this is normal or not.\nI'm assuming that macOS requires to be running for it to recognize the splitter device.  I've got an external hard disk attached to a powered USB hub which is then attached to the laptop via this splitter device.  When the computer wakes from sleep I get an error saying I should unmount the device before powering off the drive.  I never got this error with previous Mac's that had their own USB-A ports.\nIn addition to the USB hub and charger, I also have an external monitor connected via the HDMI port, so all 3 are going through this one splitter device.  I don't know if that is relevant, but I thought I'd include it in case it is.  Everything seems to work perfectly when the system is on.\nI really like the idea of when I want to do work with the larger monitor and such I can just plug one thing in, so I would really appreciate help on seeing if I can get it working in this configuration / if this is NOT normal (i.e. there is some potential hardware failure) returning it to the store I bought it from in short order.\n\nA: \nHowever, if the laptop is asleep the system stops charging. It only seems to charge asleep when the charger is directly connected to the computer. \n\nYou've narrowed down the problem to the \"splitter.\"\nIf it charges when directly connected, but not when going through the splitter, your MacBook is not the cause of the problem.  If you were to bring it into any Apple store or repair shop, the first thing they would do is hook up a known good working charger to your MBP.  If it charges while sleeping, you'd be told that your MBP is working correctly; which it is.\nWhat to do?\nThat vintage MacBook Pro has two Thunderbolt 3 ports so...\n\n\n*\n\n*Return the \"splitter.\"   \n\n*Try not to use HDMI (it's very flaky, IMO).  Use DisplayPort instead. Thunderbolt 3 natively outputs DP; it will have to convert the signals to give you HDMI. \n\n*Use a \"proper\" (meaning an active adapter) USB-C Hub with Power Delivery and 4K support if you must use HDMI.   \n\n*Because you only have 2 TB ports, I would spring for a Thunderbolt 3 dock instead.  This way you'll have ample room for growth should you want a second monitor or additional USB ports.\n\n\n(Standard disclaimer follows)\nOf course, if you're not comfortable that your MacBook Pro doesn't charge with the splitter you've chosen, by all means, return the Mac.  If your splitter continues to exhibit the same behavior, you'll have proof positive that the splitter is the issue.\n", "Q: How can I see an iPhone Smart Battery Case serial number using macOS console? My iPhone XS Max Smart Battery Case's serial number is extremely difficult to make out due to the color and wear on the fabric.\nHow do I use macOS Console.app to connect to my iPhone to see what the Smart Battery Case serial number is?\n\nA: *\n\n*Put your iPhone into the Smart Battery Case.\n\n*Unlock your iPhone.\n\n*Open Console.app on macOS.\n\n*Plug your Lightning cable into your computer.\n\n*Plug in the other end of the Lightning cable into your iPhone via the Smart Battery Case Lightning port.\n\n*Your unlocked iPhone may ask if you trust this computer.

But for example, can one user application in macOS modify the video stream for all other user applications? (e.g. assuming already that macOS does not provide itself an end-user friendly interface to define virtual backgrounds). \nBy virtual background I am referring to the ability of customizing the background on a video call so that people can see the person looking at the camera in front of the camera, but the user can use a e.g. static picture or animation for the background. Examples include this feature supported from Microsoft Teams, or this one from Zoom.\n\nA: The answer is yes. Applications can create a virtual camera, which other applications will have available in exactly the same way they have the built-in camera on a laptop available, or a USB-connected camera for example.\nThe application would need to read the images from your real camera, insert your virtual background, and then expose it as a virtual camera.\nFor example see virtual webcams such as: OBS Virtual Camera or Webcamoid.\nIf you combine the OBS Virtual Camera program with OBS Studio, you can use the green screen (chroma key) features to get the setup you're looking for.\n", "Q: App claims it's open, refuses to close I am trying to remove an App that is called \"Live Chat\" but when I go to Applications > Live Chat and select move to trash, it says that the program is open even though it is not and doesn't allow me to remove it. \nThanks!\n\nA: You can remove most apps when they are not running, so move the app to the trash and then log out of your Mac from the Apple menu - Log out...\nWhen you log back in, the app won’t start since it’s in the Trash and then you can empty it.\nAs long as it’s a normal app and not one that installed helpers, start at boot, or malware this works for all basic apps. Non-basic apps or ones that run hidden helpers like most Adobe products, Zoom, backup and remote control software need to be uninstalled or deactivated based on how they were implemented. \nLive Chat may need an uninstall...\n\n... start automatically when you turn on your computer, so you never miss a chat.\n\nIf you struggle, the steps to isolate malware and persistent apps might need a follow on question based on how your mac is set up, and the specific of the exact app you have.\n\nA: You should run the activity monitor (from Launchpad, open the folder named Other to find it) and see if there is an app called Live Chat which is maybe running in the background.\nIf you find the app in Activity Monitor double click on it and you'll be given an option to force quit the app. After that you should be able to remove app.  When you run activity monitor be sure the CPU tab near the top is selected.\n", "Q: Reading HFS standard and MFS on Catalina During the lockdown I decided to use some of my time to backup all the all Mac disks and floppies I have at home so I can store them in a somewhat more readable format that SyQuest cartridges and MFS formatted SD 400k floppies and finally free up lots of space in some libraries.\nDoing so I eventually discovered that macOS Catalina can neither mount HFS \"non plus\" (Apple removed HFS standard support in 10.15, apparently just for the sake of it... Hating this approach to \"old\", even more when they're keeping support for FAT12 DOS floppies and removing support for their own floppies...) nor MFS (it's actually not supported since Mac OS 8, but from Mac OS X 10.4 Apple offered sources to build a MFS read only support using the great system expandability features that OS X inherited from NeXT).\nSo, after the still ongoing struggle to get data off damaged floppies (I started weeks ago and still probably have a couple of weeks to go) I'm wondering how to easily access that data from disk images. I know I can use emulators such as minivmac, Sheepshaver and Mojave on VirtualBox to access that data, but that would mean a lot more work to get readable data. I'd love to simply be able to mount old disks and access data through finder.\nChapter 1: HFS Standard\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS standard options are still in /System/Library/Filesystems/hfs.fs plists, so I'm wondering if Apple disabled old HFS support through some external option. Does anyone know if there's any option to enable it back? (Maybe something like boot-args=\"no32exec=0\" to run 32-bit code). Does anyone know what would happen if I took hfs.fs from Mojave and used it in Catalina? Would it possibly work?\n\n*thejoelpatrol/fusehfs GitHub repo -> managed to build it botching the code but when I mount Standard HFS images I get errors such as Device not configured\n\n*0x09/hfsfuse GitHub repo -> it builds and installs correctly, but when I try to mount old HFS images I get Plain HFS volumes not currently supported. Couldn't open volume: Undefined error: 0\n\n*hfsutils (https://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/hfs/) -> these are the only working ones but they're a mess to work with.

Unfortunately it's built for 32 bit so Catalina can't use it (why do they keep removing features?) and I can't get it to build in Xcode.\n\n*d235j/fusemfs GitHub repo -> I can't find a way to build it either, even after updating the project, updating the code from linked repositories to the last version. Even if libfuse_ino64.2.dylib is in /usr/local/lib and that path is added to Xcode options I just keep getting ld: library not found for -lfuse_ino64.2\nUnfortunately I'm too much of a noob to be able to edit those projects, but I think it would be great if Apple offered to its user the chance to read their old Mac data like we're able to do with old DOS disks.\nPossible solution?\nApparently FuseMFS is using zydeco/libmfs GitHub repo (which is used in zydeco/minivmac4ios GitHub repo together with libhfs) to create a FUSE wrap to access those file systems, would it be easier to update FuseMFS making it buildable on Catalina and add there libhfs?\nI'm just wondering it, but not being a developer I really don't know if it's feasible.\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: Still not using the Finder, but this java-based tool was able to mount an old HFS disk image and retrieve files in my Catalina (10.15.7) environment.\nhttps://www.catacombae.org/hfsexplorer/\n\nA: Well, I'm a bit late, but Joel's released https://thejoelpatrol.github.io/fusehfs/ FuseHFS 0.15.  Apple finally removed the conflicting HFS driver stub in Monterey, so FuseHFS works again from macOS 12 and up.  There's no way to read an HFS volume on Catalina or Big Sur (outside the methods already mentioned), but every other OS version has at least read support now. (macOS 10.12 through 10.14 only allow for Apple's read-only driver; FuseHFS won't work).\n", "Q: rEFInd boot manager not showing EFI shell After succesfully installing the rEFInd tool from https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/ on a macbook with macos 10.15, restarting the laptop does bring me into the rEFInd boot manager. But the only option available is to launch macOS. I downloaded this tool to use the EFI shell and there seems to be no option to launch the shell.\nIs this some sort of package I need to install to the EFI mount?\n\nA: You need a compatible EFI Shell program (called shell.efi) in your EFI partition.\nAs mentioned in the rEFInd config file documentation, in the showtools parameter section:\n\nNote that the shell, memtest, gdisk, apple_recovery, mok_tool, and fwupdate options all require the presence of programs not included with rEFInd.\n\nThe rEFInd CD version does include an EFI shell (there is also a link for it on the Installing Additional Components section of the documentation) but this doesn't work on my macs (all 2015 or older) as the Apple EFI firmware is too old.\nYou can download an older EDK version 1 binary which should work on any version : \n\n\n*\n\n*Download Shell_Full.efi from tianocore/edk2\n\n*Rename it to shell.efi \n\n*Mount your ESP with mkdir /Volumes/ESP followed by sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/ESP\n\n*Copy shell.efi to directory /Volumes/ESP/EFI/tools where rEFInd will look by default (make directory if it doesn't exist).\n\n*rEFInd will display shell as a small icon underneath the OS icons if it finds the executable.\n\n\nA: Another alternative is to use the EFI shell included in rEFIt, the discontinued predecessor to rEFInd: http://refit.sourceforge.net/\nThe archive refit-bin-0.14.tar.gz includes a file called shell.efi that you can copy to your EFI/tools folder.\nThanks to Wayne Uroda's answer on superuser.com, I was able to install the latest NVidia drivers on my Macmini3,1 (late 2009), which now triple boots macOS, Windows 10 64-bit and MX Linux, all booting with EFI with a GPT (no hybrid MBR) and rEFInd.\nAnswer on superuser.com that helped me\n", "Q: Section Tab Missing on Document Tool Bar I want to change the starting page number in a Pages document but I don't (seem to) have the Section tab on the Document side tool bar.

This is complicated by the fact that I don't have the phone # associated with account nor do I remember the number.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: If you need access to your account, and you don't know the former number nor do you have access to any Apple devices that your Apple ID is signed into (iPhone, iPad, iPod, or Mac) then you cannot recover your account. Account recovery requires no less than the associated Apple ID email and the phone number associated with the account & devices that had access to the account.\nApple's automated ID system can only verify your account with passwords, devices & phone numbers. Emails arent a secure way of identification so they no longer use them to verify you with two-factor identification. \nWhat I would do is backtrack the previous carriers or phone numbers you've used lately. Start with your current carrier and work backwards. If you've ever had your phone number ported over from one carrier to another you need to call the carrier that brought over your number and have them provide you with it.\nIf you can at least find the phone number, but don't have access to it, then you can go through what's called Account Recovery. Just go to iforgot.apple.com and enter your Apple ID email address then the phone number on the next page and it will make you go through a waiting process to verify your accounts security (checking for active devices, breaches, etc.)\nIf you manage to find the number. Comment here because I can explain the recovery process in detail since most people end up waiting longer than expected.\n", "Q: How common is it for iPhone users to NOT be running iOS 10+?

The statistics are drawn from currently active devices (ones which have an active Internet connection and visits the App Store app).\nThe snapshot above is captured at the time of writing the answer.\n\nA: According to Apple as of Jan 2020:\n\n\n*\n\n*77% of all devices introduced in the last four years use iOS 13\n\n*17% of all devices introduced in the last four years use iOS 12\n\n*70% of all devices use iOS 13\n\n*23% of all devices use iOS 12\n\n\n\nThis is the only breakdown I could find from Apple.

The symptom of this was freezing streaming that Apple Support took 1.5 hours to diagnose and another hour to attempt to fix. \nApparently, MacBook Pro 16\" 2019 comes with two graphics card: the advertised ATI Radeon and an integrated one by Intel. ATI Radeon is supposed to be much better; thus MacBook Pro is advertising it; why do they have the integrated one I don't know. \nAnyway, my brand new MacBook (Catalina) was setup to use the integrated graphics card, while the more powerful ATI Radeon was staying idle, doing absolutely nothing. As the result it's freezing for a fraction of a second every few minutes.\nDid anybody else see this? If you have a MacBook Pro, and in About This Mac / System Report / Graphics/Displays see multiple graphics cards, which one is used by MacBook, according to About This Mac / Graphics?\nMore importantly, is it possible to reconfigure which one is being used? Apple Support tried things such reinstalling OS, which changed absolutely nothing.\n\nA: MacBook Pro has come in models with both an integrated and a discrete graphics processing unit for many years now.\nThe integrated graphics uses less energy than the discrete GPU, so in order to maximize battery life, it is used whenever possible.\nThe integrated graphics should be plenty powerful to play ordinary YouTube videos or play a DVD, which are the tasks you describe in your linked question. Unless you have an external monitor connected to the MacBook Pro, the integrated graphics should handle this fine.\nHowever, you can definitely configure your MacBook Pro to use the discrete graphics. This way you can test whether or not the problem goes away when using the discrete graphics.\nYou can the setting by opening System Preferences > Energy Saver, and removing the checkmark from the \"Automatic graphics switching\" checkbox. When this checkmark is removed, the computer will use the discrete graphics at all times.\nRead more about it in Apple's documentation: \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202043\n\nA: \nwhy do they have the integrated one I don't know. \n\nBecause it is wasteful to fire up a discrete graphics card when it is not required. The integrated card will be fine for most purposes. If the discrete graphics card was kept on at all times, you'd experience significantly shortened battery life, extra deterioration of the battery, more electricity usage, more heat, and a slightly quicker global warming-caused heat death of life on Earth. \n\nAs the result it's freezing for a fraction of a second every few minutes.\n\nCan you provide proof for this being the cause?\nThe question you want answered and the question youo are asking are different. You are trying to determine the cause of the freezing, which is not necessarily the fact that your MacBook has decided to use its integrated graphicss card. \n", "Q: Can I get older (recent) versions of Keynote?

I've got around 300gb of data on my old pc and transferred just 50gb to start with so that I don't have to wait for days to finish, but now when I open the migration assistant it says that the migration is \"complete\" and does not allow me to conduct a second transfer. \nIs there any way to do another migration?\nThanks!\n\nA: Your 'get out of jail free' card would be if all you have left to transfer are some simple stand-alone documents, rather than user-specific data, email accounts, browser logins & passwords etc. You could then just network the two together & file-share, rather than migrate.\nEach migration will set up a new user account on your new Mac.\nYour current stumbling block is you would have to keep generating new names. As soon as you do, it will let you proceed - but don't do that.\nPicking this apart manually afterwards is going to be an absolute nightmare.* \nSet aside sufficient time to be able to do this in one go & start over.

I am fixing an acquaintance's computer that ran out of disk space. Space was so critical that the OS did not launch any apps. I booted in Safe Mode (holding Shift during startup), deleted 1.5 GB of applications, and was able to launch the OS in normal mode and inspect the file system.\nA search with du -sh * by hand revealed log files in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Logs/Mail, in the format imagp.gmail.com-<UID>.txt that were 29 GB and 6 GB. I understood from this thread that these files are simply a log of all connections to the Gmail server:\n\nGmail is having trouble with the mac Mail client for quite some time. ... The Mail logs keep a record of the connection process, they're useful to to diagnose problems, ... It's safe to delete those logs.\n\nI inspected the files: they contain both the records of the connections (error codes, server names) and also the content of emails (headers, plain text bodies, and mime-type attachments).\nTo prevent these problems in the future, does the OS have a way to limit the size of those logs, e.g. keeping only the last 30 days of connection, or doing a first-in-first-out of lines up to a certain file size?\n\nA: I use some gmail accounts & I also faced a 11 GB log file while analysing disk space one day.

Less than one hour ago I opened a few tabs on Safari. One of them is using 1 GB of ram for some reason. It's version 13.0.5. \nWhat are the reasons behind this? Should I shut it down? Restart? Clear caches? \n\nA: Safari can be a resource hog, particularly if you have a lot of tabs or windows open to graphics-intense sites, so this doesn't actually surprise me. If you turn on the 'Compressed Memory' column in Activity Monitor — from the menu bar: View → Colums → Compressed Memory — you'll likely see that that most of this memory usage is stuff that's been compressed and shunted off to virtual memory until it's needed.\nFor a comparison, I've been doing a lot of AppleScripting recently and so Activity Monitor reports that Script Editor is taking up 3.39 Gb of memory, with 2.79 Gb in compressed VM storage. MacOS has sophisticated memory management; as long as you're not seeing strange behavior — e.g. slower than normal response times — you shouldn't have to worry about it.\n", "Q: How do you find a lost serial number for a stolen Mac to make a police report? How do you find a lost serial number for a stolen Mac to make a police report? What is the easiest way to recover a serial number without having the product box or receipt? Can you get it by using your AppleID and how do you do that?\n\nA: If it’s signed into iCloud, you can see it and its details under “My Devices” in your Apple ID. See here for instructions from Apple. \n\nA: You do easily determine the serial number of all the devices linked with your Apple ID using just the Apple ID, without needing to have access to the product box or receipt.\nLog into Manage your Apple ID website with your Apple ID using a desktop Web browser.\nOnce logged in, scroll down to the Devices section, locate your device and you can find the Serial number.\n\nAlternatively, if you have an iPhone/iPad logged in with the same Apple ID, it's much easier to determine the Serial number for all the devices linked to your Apple ID.\nOn your iPhone/iPad, go to the Settings app → Tap on your name shown at the top. On the next screen, scroll down until you see the list of all the devices linked to your Apple ID and tap on the device name.\n \nThe next screen would show the serial number of your Mac just like how it was shown on the website.\n\nYou can take either one of the approach that's the most convenient for you.\n", "Q: How to split a video exported from iMovie into multiple shorter videos I have several movies that have been exported from iMovie in the mp4 format.

When doing screen capture in MacOS, you get a pop up in bottom right corner. If you click on it, you get UI for simple edits on this image. Nevertheless, I love it! It looks like this\n\nBut how can I use it for existing files?\n\nA: By default, since macOS Mojave, when taking a screen shot a floating thumbnail briefly appears in the lower right-hand corner of the Desktop, which one can click on to edit the screen shot.\nThe editor which appears, because by default Show Floating Thumbnail is checked in the Options for taking a screen shot, can be used on an image file or screen shot afterwards by selecting the image file in Finder and then right-click on the image and select: Quick Actions > Markup\nYou can also, after selecting the image file, press the spacebar to bring up a quicklook view and click the Markup button.\n\nA: I do a screen capture using Shift-Option-4 and I don't get any UI for this.

In December I purchased some AirPods Pro headphones and love them...mostly. The main downside is they're very unreliable with my Mac and troubleshooting has proven challenging.\nFirst, and least concerning, is it often takes a little bit of time to pair when it's not already paired. 10, 15, 20 seconds may pass before it pairs. But next come the real problems. It's not uncommon for the headphones to randomly disconnect. Also, when I'm on calls in Webex or Microsoft Teams, people will often tell me my audio quality is poor but I can hear them just fine. If I have Webex call my phone, even using my Airpods, the audio is fine. This happens enough that I can't trust it to work reliably for talking on my Mac.\nI'm using three other Bluetooth (or 2.4Ghz) devices. I have a Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and a Logitech mouse which uses one of those USB dongles (I don't think that's Bluetooth). Wireless is setup at 5Ghz so that's not a concern. I've heard USB 3 can interfere with 2.4Ghz signals. I'm using 2x 4k Dell monitors that connect using HDMI->USB-C adapters to the back of the mini. The keyboard and trackpad are reliable so I'm not 100% convinced that's the root cause, nor do I know how to fix that problem if it is.\nI have used the Bluetooth Explorer you can download from Apple and found the AirPods RSSI does move more than the keyboard or trackpad. It'll be in the -40 range (very good!) and dip down into the -60 range, or worse. I just don't know if this is expected behavior with AirPods.\nApple Support had me reset the AirPods which helped for a bit but the quality is still a problem.\nCan someone suggest troubleshooting steps I can take?\n\nA: If all else fails you can reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. However, this will reset all connected Bluetooth devices, including a keyboard and mouse.\nIn other words, this will remove all existing pairing information for Bluetooth devices, so each will need to be reconnected.\n", "Q: dd on Catalina gives \"Permission denied\" error even after grant it Full Disk Access in Security and Privacy date; sudo dd bs=1M if=2020-02-13-raspbian-buster-full.img of=/dev/rdisk3; date\n    Thu Apr 23 20:22:45 PDT 2020\n    Password:\n    dd: failed to open '/dev/rdisk3': Permission denied\n    Thu Apr 23 20:22:54 PDT 2020\n\nI've tried giving Full Disk Access to all of these, but to no avail:\n/usr/local/bin/gdd\n/usr/local/bin/dd\n/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin/gdd\n/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin/dd\n\n\nThe device exists:\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         1.0 TB     disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +1.0 TB     disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume d - Data                638.3 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 81.1 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                526.9 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      3.2 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume d                       11.1 GB    disk1s5\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *8.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS time-machine2           2.0 TB     disk2s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS data2                   6.0 TB     disk2s3\n\n/dev/disk3 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *31.9 GB    disk3\n   1:             Windows_FAT_32 NO NAME                 31.9 GB    disk3s1\n\nI'm not sure what the problem is?\n\nA: My bad.\nIf this happens to you, you might want to check the switch on your SD card to see if it is set to read-only. :)\n\nA: Catalina mounts system directory's in apfs containers (think linux lvm volume)\nexplicitly as read-only, yet another security feature. \nTo access raw block devices you need to remount with explicitly adding rw \noptions: \nbsd mount: mount -uw / or \nmount -X /, try to add -o remount I think, look at man mount and diskutil help I don't recall bsd mount opts now exactly but starting macOS in single mode will give you a warning about read-only and how to remount in rw, so try booting holding cmd - s and take a look what it says, type exit to start launched default session ergo normal start. \nusing gnu mount: \nmount /dev/diskXsX -o remount,rw,force\nWhat does df -H and mount shows in terminal? Check if mount points are flagged as ro only. \nUpdate: disable this \"feature\" (SIP) in recovery mode:\ncsrutil enable --without fs , then you can remount with rw access without disabling SIP completely - although I always disable all SIP stuff including gatekeeper sudo spctl --master-disable but it's not recommended by apple  \n\nA: Most probably you are using an SD card adapter.  Many are defective.  The best solution: use a micro SD to USB adaptor (1€ on eBay) it has no switch, it will work.\nBefore that try to touch the switch or reinsert, it might work.\nThis is bad quality contacts, even if the micro SD itself is good.\n", "Q: Where are the settings for microphone input volume stored? I'm trying to write a script that detects a change in this setting:\n\nHowever, I'm having trouble locating the .plist file where this setting is stored. Does anyone where I can find this file? \nEdit: I feel like it may be located at /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist\nhowever, I can't narrow down the numeric value that corresponds to input volume\n\nA: I don't know in which file the value is stored, I haven't found any file change in your suggested file when I changed the input volume.\nBut you can access the value via Terminal and AppleScript:\nosascript -e 'input volume of (get volume settings)'\n\nThis will get your input volume as a number between 0 and 100.\n\nA: With additional testing, I have located the file where input volume is stored. It is actually in /Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist as I suspected and the corresponding numeric value for input volume is under AppleHDAEngineInput > Controls > Item 2 > Value (as shown below). \n\nHowever, this value only seems to update after restarting the coreaudiod process with this command: sudo launchctl stop com.apple.audio.coreaudiod && sudo launchctl start com.apple.audio.coreaudiod. Any changes made to microphone input volume in System Preferences will not change the value found in the .plist file until the coreaudiod process has restarted. Editing this value does not seem to change the actual microphone input volume. \n", "Q: How can I modify the hosts file on MacOS Catalina? I need to test out a site before it's actually live for customers, and doing so with a specific hostname. For this I'd like to modify the well-known hosts file, however it doesnt seem to work.\nAn answer here mentions to do a copy of the file and modify, and then paste it back to the original /etc/hosts location. I've tried it but doesnt work.\nI've tried the guide here too, with restarting the DNS services (sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder) on my computer. Doesnt work either. I've made a complete reboot too, to no avail.\nHave Apple prevented people in MacOS Catalina (10.15.X and later) to modify this file? It seems a lot of people are having problem with this. \nThanks for your help!\nUpdate: To clarify: I can successfully change the hosts file and save it, but it seems to have no effect.\n\nA: What I did was sudo nano /private/etc/hosts and it worked.\n\nA: So it actually did work.\nWhat I did wrong (it seems) is that I had too many spaces between the ip and the hostname inside /etc/hosts. I fixed the spaces with the nano editor and now it works.\nIt's worth to point out that using nslookup will not work however to test your dns change (found reason here):\n\nnslookup only does proper DNS resolution, which is significantly\ndifferent from the Name Service Switch subsystem that your other\napplications use; that is to say nslookup ignores /etc/hosts and mDNS.\n\n\nA: Gas Mask is an excellent app to manage your hosts file without using Terminal. I use it to quickly switch between different hosts files for different uses\n", "Q: Time Machine backup fails after copying some files My Time Machine backups started consistently failing, but only after copying a certain number of files to the backup disk. \nRepeated attempts to back up would fail more quickly, almost as if a particular file were causing the failure. \nThe error messages say to try to repair the backup disk, similar to\n\nTime Machine couldn't complete the backup to \"MyBackupDrive\". An error occurred while copying  files. The problem may be temporary. If the problem persists, use Disk Utility to repair your backup disk.\n\nHowever, repairing the backup disk failed to resolve the issue. Reparing my boot disk and using a different backup disk also failed.\nI am not (to my knowledge) using any services or applications known to cause Time Machine problems, as detailed in answers to related questions.\nHow can I get the backup to succeed?\n\nA: The issue may be a corrupted file. Open Console.app and filter errors for \"backupd\".\nYou may notice an error related to a particular file which is causing the failure, for example\nError: (-48) SrcErr:NO Copying /Volumes/com.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots/Backups.backupdb/mycomputer/2020-04-23-231950/Macintosh HD/Users/myusername/bad_file to /Volumes/MyBackupDrive/Backups.backupdb/mycomputer/2020-04-23-231950.inProgress/A93DB1E9-8D23-482D-953E-0D808B6380AD/Macintosh HD/Users/myusername/bad_file\n\nIf so, you can try deleting this file (completely). \nIn my case, to be safe, I also restarted my machine, reformatted the backup drive (OS X extended, case-sensitive, journaled, encrypted) and re-added it to Time Machine, but I am not sure if any or all of those steps were essential.\n", "Q: What causes LG screen colors to change when I install a Mac OS update? I have 2 Macbook Pro 15 inch from 2018. \nI have updated one of the both with the last Mac OS update (not exactly the last but 1 before), and my 2 LG external screens (4k) are not usable anymore, it burst my eyes, especially on heat colors (i barely don't see any difference on dark colors, but for example, white on green really hurts your eyes).\nSince i have the chance to have 2 identical Macbook Pro and i didn't update the second one, i made the test to plug it instead of the updated one (i am using 2 USB C port). And it still works fine!\nIt's been almost 2 years i have these Macbook Pro and these 2 screens, everything always worked perfectly, and the issue appeared right after the update on one of it.\nWhat do you think i should do ?\n\nA: I've the same issue..

Tried a restart of my macbook but that didn't help. Monitor to factory settings isn't fixing anything as well.. Macbook colour repair shows me that I've around 30 bad colour profiles. Don't know if this is what has to be fixed but i can't repair it unfortunately..\nIf your color changes as the sun comes up and down, check for Night Shift. \nI've found how to fix it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences \n\n*Go to Displays \n\n*Turn off 'High Dynamic Range' This fixed it for me.

I connect to the website (Blackboard if you are interested) through my Macbook and I can share my screen and applications through Blackboard (an option not available when connecting through an iPad) so that my students see my Macbook scree, the slides there etc.. I use a lot of graphs in my teaching and I would like to use an iPad to draw the graphs as I can draw them there in real time, rather than having to create them beforehand.\nI have a Macbook (mid 2014) with OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 (I will update the os at the end of the term) and an iPad Air 2 version 11.2.5.\nI have tried Duet and Air Display but I have realized that those apps just extend the Macbook screen, using the iPad as a second screen. That is not what I want. I want to be able to show, through my Macbook, the drawing apps I am using on my iPad. I have a lightning to USB cable and so I can physically connect the iPad to my Macbook. Thanks.\n\nA: As you mentioned yourself, you can use QuickTime Player in order to view your iPad screen on the Mac in real time. Here's the exact procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a USB-to-Lightning cable capable of data transfer, connect the iPad to the Mac.\n\n*Unlock the device and opt to Trust This Computer, entering your passcode if needed.\n\n*Launch QuickTime Player, then do ^⌘N (Command + Ctrl + N).\n\n*After approving access to camera and microphone if requested (as is needed on macOS Mojave and later), click on the small downwards-facing arrow next to the record button.\n\n*Choose your device under Camera in the drop-down menu.\n\n\nYou will now see the iPhone within QuickTime Player on your screen. Keep in mind you won't be able to play content with DRM (e.g. iTunes, Netflix etc.) this way.\n\nA: There are a couple 3rd party tools that allow you to mirror your iPad to your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reflector 3 ($18 USD; Free 7 day trial).  This was designed to be used in the classroom and supports both Mac, Windows and even Amazon FireTV environments as well as iOS and Android.\n\n*AirServer for Mac. ($12 USD Edu; $30 USD Commercial; Free 30 day trial).   Works with both AirPlay and GoogleCast so any device that's compatible with it can mirror to your Mac/PC.\nBoth of these are wireless and work with more than just your Mac giving you much more flexibility. As long as you can share your screen/window with the Blackboard site/app, you will be able to use your iPad and share it as you describe.\n", "Q: Is there a way to automatically maximize a window when dragging it to an external monitor?

My keyboard and track pad are not working and I'm thinking it's neither the keyboard nor the track pad nor even the flex cable. When I was replacing the flex cable the circuit board that the flex cable connect to (from the logic board) short and sparked - somehow I'd forgotten to turn of the laptop. \nThis is the small board located below the battery above the track pad on the MacBook Pro Retina 2015 13\". I guess I need to replace that board. But I don't know what it's called. Does anyone here know?\n\nA: There are two places where the track pad connects - the logic board (red) arrow and to the track pad PCB (red square)\n\nImage Source:  Ifixit.com\nIf what you're referring to is what's identified by the red square at the bottom of the image above, then it's the PCB. It's  not sold as a separate assembly (AFAIK) and you have to replace the entire track pad assembly (PN# 923-00518). If it's the top portion (red arrow), you have to get the logic board repaired/replaced.\nIt's possible you could buy a salvaged track pad from eBay just to get the PCB, but it's an \"unknown.\"  You could end up getting a track pad with a bad PCB again, but if the price is good, it may be worth the gamble. \nFinally, if you got a spark when connecting the flex cable, replace the flex cable as well.  When you see a spark, that means enough voltage passed through the cable to arc which could have permanently damaged the cable - it's cheap enough that you should just do it anyway and not try to salvage a cable of questionable function.\n", "Q: Why does the pitch of my MacBook Pro changes when i plug something off the headphone jack? I've been wondering about that for quite a long time already.\nMy MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) runs on Mojave (10.14.4) and whenever i'm plugging off my headphones from the MacBook to switch to the internal Speakers the pitch of the outcoming audio is about 3 semitones up and after about 15 seconds it switches back to the original audio signal. \nHonestly i don't remember for how long this problem is occurs but i think i noticed it first after a major software version update.\nAs i'm developing myself i'm just curious how something like this can happen, it makes no sense to me at all. (I can only guess it's a software driver bug)\nA good friend of mine was also running a Mid 2015 Macbook Pro 15\" and he never had that problem.\n\nA: Try opening the Audio MIDI Setup app\n\nand adjusting the Format of the External Headphones or the MacBook Pro Speakers so they're the same sample rate (48,000 Hz in this screenshot).\nMine were not the same.\n"]
